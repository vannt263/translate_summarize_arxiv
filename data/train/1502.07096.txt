    "hd 188112 is a bright ( @xmath4=10.2 ) and nearby star ( @xmath080 pc , hipparcos parallax ) that is found below the extreme horizontal branch in the log @xmath5 - @xmath6  plane ( 21 500 k , log @xmath5 = 5.6 ) .",
    "the spectroscopic parameters , combined with the parallax distance allowed to determine a mass of 0.24 @xmath7 @xmath1  for the star , too low to sustain helium burning , thus making it an extremely low mass ( elm ) white dwarf ( wd ) @xcite . this mass estimate is also in agreement with the theoretical evolutionary tracks for post red giant branch of @xcite .",
    "hd 188112 is part of a close binary system with an orbital period of @xmath014.5 hr and a semi - amplitude of k = 188 km s@xmath8 , which lead to a lower limit of 0.73 @xmath1  for the companion s mass .",
    "a main sequence star of such a mass would contribute to the infrared flux of the system , but no near infrared excess is seen in the 2mass data .",
    "there is also no trace of the companion in the high - resolution optical data ( @xmath9 = 48,000 ) , thus indicating that this companion is a rather massive wd @xcite . without knowing the inclination of the system , it is not possible to put further constraints on the mass of the unseen companion .",
    "however , assuming tidally locked rotation , the inclination of the system can be determined by measuring the rotational broadening ( v@xmath10sin@xmath11 ) of metal lines .",
    "given the fact that the optical spectra is devoid of metal lines , except for one mg  ii line too weak for such a measurement , uv spectra were needed in order to determine the rotational broadening .",
    "we obtained hubble space telescope ( hst ) high resolution ( @xmath9 = 114,000 ) nuv ( 2660 @xmath3 2935  ) and fuv ( 1242 @xmath3 1440  ) stis spectra of hd 188112 .",
    "the fuv observations correspond to 22 individual exposures of 120 s that were then corrected for radial velocity shifts and co - added .",
    "there are also two nuv exposures ( 1040.2 and 2860.2 s ) , taken in time - tag mode , that were afterwards divided into shorter exposures , corrected for radial velocity shifts and co - added in order to have two spectra with sharp ( unblurred ) metallic lines .",
    "as expected from the rather plain optical spectrum of the star , the uv range is not crowded with lines .",
    "the nuv spectrum features a set of mg  ii lines as well as a few fe  ii lines .",
    "the fuv spectrum shows a lot more lines , of si  ii - iii - iv , s  ii , fe  iii as well as additional ones that still need to be identified .",
    "even if this portion of the spectrum is richer in lines , the majority of them are unblended and well isolated , thus suitable for abundances and vsin@xmath11 measurements .",
    "radial velocities were measured for the 22 fuv spectra using si  iii and  iv lines while the mg  ii lines were used in the 29 nuv exposures made out of the time - tag data .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the phased radial velocity curve , according to the parameters of @xcite .",
    "our additional uv velocities end up very close to the predicted ones , meaning that the orbital parameters are well constrained with the optical data .",
    "our model atmospheres and synthetic spectra are computed using the hybrid , non - lte approach discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the atmospheric structure , such as the temperature and density stratification , is computed with atlas12 @xcite .",
    "this atmospheric structure is then used by two additional codes that compute the non - lte population numbers ( detail ) and the final synthetic spectra with detailed line - broadening ( surface ) .",
    "we computed small metal grids of synthetic spectra for various abundances of magnesium , silicon and iron , keeping the fundamental parameters fixed at the values determined by @xcite . in a first step",
    ", we used the mg and si lines to measure the rotational velocity ( v@xmath10sin@xmath11 ) , as well as their abundances .",
    "resulting fits for the mg lines and three si  iii lines are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] . a dozen or so silicon lines were simultaneously fitted , and we obtained a very good fit for the three different ionization stages ( si  ii - iii - iv ) .",
    "our resulting parameters are :    * log @xmath2(mg)/@xmath2(h ) = @xmath36.40 @xmath12 0.07 ( @xmath0 1/100 solar ) * log @xmath2(si)/@xmath2(h ) = @xmath37.25 @xmath12 0.05 ( @xmath0 1/560 solar ) * v@xmath10sin@xmath11 = 8.2 @xmath12 0.2 km s@xmath8    with the uncertainties derived while re - doing the fitting procedure with various @xmath6  and log @xmath5 within the error limits given by @xcite ( @xmath12 500 k and @xmath12 0.05 dex ) .",
    "we also fitted the iron lines present in the fuv and nuv spectra , this time keeping the v@xmath10sin@xmath11 value to the one stated above ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "we found a small discrepancy between the abundances indicated by the fe  iii and  ii lines :    * log @xmath2(fe  iii)/@xmath2(h ) = @xmath35.81 @xmath12 0.04 ( @xmath0 1/20 solar ) * log @xmath2(fe  ii)/@xmath2(h ) = @xmath35.62 @xmath12 0.08",
    "by making the assumption that the system is tidally locked , so that the rotation period of hd188112 is the same as its orbital period , then the vsin@xmath11 measured ( 8.2 @xmath12 0.2 km s@xmath8 ) and the mass of hd188112 ( 0.24 @xmath12 0.1 @xmath1 ) allow to derive a mass between 1.05 and 1.25 @xmath1  for the unseen wd companion . however we can not currently ascertain that the system is in synchronous rotation .    nevertheless , if the mass of the companion is below @xmath01.10 @xmath1  and its core composed of carbon and oxygen , the system could be a candidate for the double detonation scenario @xcite . according to this scenario , a surface detonation in the helium shell of",
    "the massive wd companion would trigger the detonation and explosion of its carbone / oxygen core , leading to a supernova ia event .",
    "hd188112 could play the role of the helium donor . on the other hand ,",
    "if the companion has a mass above @xmath01.16 @xmath1 , then the total mass of the system would be above the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "additional abundances and upper limits still have to be measured for other metallic elements .",
    "no lines of carbon , nitrogen or oxygen are visible in the uv spectra , so only upper limits will be derive for these elements , but we do see some sulphur lines in the fuv spectra and some nickel lines are also expected to be seen .",
    "up to now , we found a rather large abundance variation among mg , si and fe .",
    "we will also try to put constraints on the microturbulent velocity .",
    "new radial velocities will also be obtained from recent optical spectra and combined with the uv ones we could derived new orbital parameters for hd188112 , though we do nt expect those parameters to change much , given the well predicted values for our uv radial velocities .",
