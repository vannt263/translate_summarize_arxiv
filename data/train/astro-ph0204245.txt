    "there has been outstanding progress in solar neutrino research in the last several years .",
    "the large water cherenkov detectors superkamiokande ( sk )  @xcite and the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno )  @xcite have begun to measure the high - energy solar neutrinos from @xmath7b decay in real time with a high counting rate .",
    "the results from these two neutrino telescopes of a new generation add significant information to the existing results from the chlorine @xcite and gallium @xcite radiochemical experiments and the kamiokande experiment @xcite .",
    "the elastic scattering results of sk combined with the charged current results from sno indicate that , in addition to electron neutrinos , active neutrinos of other flavors are reaching the earth from the sun .",
    "the combined analysis of results of all these experiments gives convincing evidence that part of the electron neutrinos formed in thermonuclear reactions in the sun change their flavor on their way to the earth .",
    "further measurement of the details of flavor conversion for solar neutrinos requires a new generation of neutrino telescopes that will be sensitive to the spectrum below 2  mev , a region that contains the proton - proton @xmath8 and cno continua as well as the @xmath9be and @xmath10 lines .",
    "although there are many promising ideas for real - time low - energy neutrino detectors @xcite , at the present time only the radiochemical gallium experiments are able to measure and monitor this part of the solar neutrino spectrum .",
    "the 233-kev threshold of the reaction @xmath11ga@xmath12ge @xcite enables one to measure the @xmath2 neutrinos , the principal component of the solar neutrino spectrum .",
    "if we exclude exotic hypotheses , the rate of the @xmath2 reaction is directly related to the solar luminosity and is insensitive to alterations in the solar models that influence the subsequent reactions in the solar fusion chain .    the neutrino capture rate in @xmath13ga predicted by the standard solar model ( ssm ) @xcite is @xmath14  snu , with the main contribution of 69.7  snu from the @xmath2 neutrinos   atoms of the neutrino absorbing isotope .",
    "contributions by @xmath9be and @xmath7b neutrinos are 34.2  snu and 12.1  snu , respectively .",
    "the insensitivity of ga to variation in the solar model is seen in the independently calculated result of 127.2  snu  @xcite for the total capture rate .    from the results of the sno and sk experiments we now have a high accuracy measurement of the @xmath7b flux that reaches the earth and its electron neutrino component . in the near future",
    "it is expected that the kamland experiment  @xcite will greatly restrict the range of possible electron neutrino mixing parameters .",
    "this data , combined with results from the borexino experiment  @xcite , will give us a good measurement of the @xmath9be flux from the sun . by subtracting the @xmath9be and @xmath7b components from the total signal in the ga experiment",
    ", we will obtain a measurement of a fundamental astrophysical parameter  the neutrino flux from the proton - proton fusion reaction .",
    "there will be a slight contamination from the cno and @xmath10 neutrinos but this can be removed with the information from the cl experiment . a rough estimate of the @xmath2 neutrino flux using the information",
    "that we have now is presented in the next to last section . since in the immediate future",
    "only the ga experiments provide this measurement , it is very important that both sage @xcite and gallex s successor gno @xcite continue to operate so as to improve the accuracy of their results .",
    "the experimental layout and procedures , including extraction of germanium from gallium , counting of @xmath13ge , and data analysis , are described in detail in our article `` measurement of the solar neutrino capture rate with gallium metal '' in physical review c @xcite .",
    "that article gives the sage results for the period january 1990 through december 1997 .",
    "since it contains a complete description of the experiment and the analysis techniques , we refer the reader who wishes further detail to that publication . here",
    "we briefly discuss the main principles of the experiment , give the statistical analysis of the data from 19982001 , present new results for some systematic uncertainties , and conclude with the current implications of the sage result for solar and neutrino physics .",
    "the sage experiment is situated in a specially built deep underground laboratory @xcite at the baksan neutrino observatory ( bno ) of the institute for nuclear research of the russian academy of sciences in the northern caucasus mountains .",
    "it is located 3.5  km from the entrance of a horizontal adit excavated into the side of mount andyrchi .",
    "the main chamber of the laboratory is 60  m long , 10  m wide , and 12  m high .",
    "the rock gives an overhead shielding equivalent to 4700  m of water and reduces the muon flux by a factor of @xmath15 .",
    "the measured muon flux is @xmath16/(@xmath4-s ) @xcite . to reduce neutron and gamma backgrounds from the rock , the laboratory is entirely lined with 60  cm of low - radioactivity concrete with an outer 6  mm steel shell .",
    "the flux of neutrons with energy ( 111 ) mev is less than @xmath17/(@xmath4-s ) @xcite .",
    "all facilities required by the experiment are in this underground area , with additional rooms devoted to chemistry , counting , and a low - background solid - state ge detector .",
    "subsidiary measurements are made in a general laboratory building outside the adit .",
    "the gallium target used at the present time for measurements is about 50  t. it is in the form of liquid metal and is contained in 7 chemical reactors .",
    "a measurement of the solar neutrino capture rate , which we call a `` run '' , begins by adding to the gallium a stable ge carrier .",
    "the carrier is a ga - ge alloy with a known ge content of approximately 350  @xmath18 g and is distributed equally among all reactors .",
    "the reactor contents are stirred thoroughly to disperse the ge throughout the ga mass .",
    "after a typical exposure interval of 4  weeks , the ge carrier and @xmath13ge atoms produced by solar neutrinos and background sources are chemically extracted from the ga using procedures described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the final step of the chemical procedure is the synthesis of germane ( geh@xmath19 ) , which is used as the proportional counter fill gas with an admixture of ( 8090)%  xe .",
    "the total efficiency of extraction is the ratio of mass of ge in the germane to the mass of initial ge carrier and is typically in the range of ( 8090)% .",
    "the systematic uncertainty in this efficiency is 3.4% , mainly arising from uncertainties in the mass of added and extracted carrier .",
    "each extraction dissolves @xmath200.1% of the gallium .",
    "ga metal is regenerated from the accumulated extracted solutions , purified , and subsequently will be returned to the target .",
    "the proportional counter is placed in the well of a nai detector that is within a large passive shield and is counted for a typical period of 46  months .",
    "@xmath13ge decays via electron capture to @xmath13ga with a half - life of 11.43  d. low energy @xmath21- and @xmath22-shell auger electrons and x  rays from electron shell relaxation produce a nearly point - like ionization in the counter gas , resulting in a fast rise time for the pulse from the counter .",
    "in contrast , most background events leave an extended trail of ionization , producing a slower rise time .",
    "a candidate @xmath13ge event must thus have an energy within a window around an @xmath22 or @xmath21 peak and must also have a rise time consistent with point - like ionization .",
    "in addition , since @xmath13ge decays without gamma emission , this event must not be coincident with an event in the nai detector .",
