    "quantum spin chains are one of the most extensively studied systems by way of numerical calculations . in this article",
    "we consider isotropic spin-@xmath4 anti - ferromagnetic heisenberg ( afh ) spin chain , whose hamiltonian is represented as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a positive coupling constant and @xmath7 denotes spin operator at @xmath8-th site .",
    "after haldane conjectured the existence of finite excitation gap for integer spin chains and the absence for half - integer ones @xcite , many efforts have been performed to confirm this conjecture .",
    "we focus on numerical analysis of the afh model in the following .    a simple but concrete way to obtain the gap energy of the spin-@xmath4 afh chain in the thermodynamic limit is to numerically calculate the excitation energies for finite size systems , and to perform the finite size scaling . conventionally lanczos method is applied to the hamiltonian ( eq .  ( [ h ] ) ) expressed as a large sparse matrix in order to obtain lower lying states and their energies .",
    "the major shortcoming of this way is that the lanczos diagonalization requires huge numerical resources .",
    "this is because the matrix dimension of the @xmath9-site system is of the order of @xmath10 , that rapidly increases with both @xmath9 and @xmath4 .",
    "the largest system size @xmath9 which is manageable with current computer is around 36 ( for @xmath11 ) even now .",
    "the density - matrix renormalization - group ( dmrg ) invented by white  @xcite is a novel and powerful computational method , which overcomes the limitation of the manageable system size in the lanczos diagonalization .",
    "it enables us to obtain physical observables such as ground state energy , correlation functions , etc .",
    ", of large scale systems very accurately without performing extensive computations .",
    "it is not overwhelming to say that the dmrg is one of the standard tools to study low dimensional quantum systems .",
    "dmrg is a real - space renormalization method , which divides the whole system into the left and the right blocks , and reduces the degree of freedom of each block using the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix ( dm ) as probabilistic measures to choose the relevant block - spin states .",
    "the number of the block spin state kept under the rg transformation is conventionally represented by the letter @xmath12 .",
    "it is important to choose sufficiently large @xmath12 in order to keep numerical precision .",
    "the computational cost in dmrg is , roughly speaking , proportional to @xmath13 , which is not heavily dependent on size @xmath9 .    when applying dmrg to the spin-@xmath4 afh chain specified by eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) , the block spin states have total spin @xmath14 up to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a non - negative integer and depends on the number of spins in the block , we have to keep sufficient numbers of the block - spin state up to a certain total - spin @xmath14 .",
    "this is problematic for large @xmath4 chains , because the system has spin rotational symmetry ; the eigenvalues of the dm are @xmath17-fold degenerated , since a block spin state with spin @xmath14 belongs to @xmath18 spin multiplet .",
    "consequently the necessary block spin states ( @xmath19 ) increases rapidly with @xmath4 .",
    "the problem of @xmath17-fold degeneracy can be overcome by integrating out the @xmath0 symmetry of the spin chain , and by representing the afh hamiltonian using the total spin basis . as a result",
    ", the afh system can be represented as a quantum limit of the _ interaction round a face _ ( irf ) model  @xcite .",
    "sierra and nishino @xcite have modified dmrg algorithm for the @xmath20 and @xmath21 afh models in the irf representation ( rep ) , where their numerical procedure is called ` irf - dmrg ' .",
    "wada  @xcite has further developed irf - dmrg for the cases @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "it is easily understood that the the computational cost of irf - dmrg is much lower than that of the conventional dmrg , since the dimension of the associated hamiltonian matrix in irf rep is much smaller than that in conventional ( @xmath22 vertex ) rep .",
    "now we demonstrate the numerical efficiency of irf - dmrg when it is applied to afh model for higher spin ( @xmath24 ) chains . in order to treat large @xmath4 systems ,",
    "wada  @xcite has developed a way of obtaining the irf expression for the heisenberg interaction for @xmath24 . in the irf formulation ,",
    "the spin excited states can be targeted by putting an additional auxiliary ( or ghost ) spin to the spin chain ; more details are shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .    before showing the calculated results we stress that all the numerical data are obtained using personal computer with the moderate power ( specfp95 @xmath25 ) .",
    "this is because the hilbert space dimension in the irf rep is much smaller than that in the conventional @xmath26 basis rep .",
    "for example , in the case of spin-@xmath23 spin chain , to keep @xmath27 states in the irf rep is equivalent to keep @xmath28 in the conventional rep .",
    "we keep 100 states at most , in the irf rep .",
    "the ground state energy density @xmath29 and the estimated gap energy @xmath30 for @xmath1 are @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and those for @xmath2 are @xmath33 and @xmath34  @xcite .    having described the computational benefits of irf formulation , now let us observe the boundary effect from the irf view point . since dmrg ( including the irf - dmrg ) chiefly treats systems with open boundary , it is important to decrease the boundary effect and obtain the properties of bulk state .    in order to estimate the spin excitation gap of afh in the thermodynamic limit , white _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite minimized the boundary effect by tuning the coupling constants @xmath35 at both ends of the spin chain .",
    "they found that for @xmath1 chain the best @xmath35 is @xmath36 for the first excited state , and is @xmath37 for the ground state .",
    "let us review how fast the boundary effect decreases with the system size when @xmath38 .",
    "figure  [ fig : egap ] shows the gap energies @xmath30 as a function of the system size @xmath9 . after rapid increase with @xmath9 , the gap energy @xmath39 becomes almost independent of @xmath9 when it is larger than @xmath40 .",
    "it should be noted that it is possible to estimate @xmath41 from the data @xmath42 .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath35 deviates from the best value , @xmath43 shows very slow increases with @xmath9 , this makes the finite size scaling very difficult .",
    "what happens when @xmath44 for the first excited state ?",
    "it is believed that the magnon ( or the domain wall excitation ) has zero momentum ( @xmath45 in their definition ) and it distributes quite uniformly  @xcite .",
    "the situation is quite similar to the case of a particle in tight binding model with shallow negative potential at the system boundary .",
    "the irf rep detects the magnon distribution more clearly , since it is possible to obtain the partial spin average @xmath46 the derivative of @xmath47 with respect to the lattice coordinate @xmath8 is proportional to the density of the quasi particle ( @xmath22 magnon ) . to speak precisely , it is possible to obtain @xmath47 from the numerical data of the conventional dmrg , but careful treatment of numerical data is required ; the irf - dmrg provides @xmath48 more directly .",
    "figure [ fig : save ] shows @xmath47 for three different @xmath49s .",
    "as is seen the partial spin average is quite linear in @xmath8 at the best boundary condition ( bc ) of @xmath38 .",
    "the partial spin average shall be a good reference data when searching the similar bc for the higher spin chains .",
    "more detailed analysis will be published elsewhere .    in conclusion",
    "we have demonstrated the numerical advantage of irf formulation through the study of the afh model , particularly for higher spin chains .",
    "the ground state energy densities @xmath29 and gap energies @xmath30 are obtained with moderate computational cost .",
    "the results are @xmath31 , @xmath32 for @xmath1 , and @xmath33 , @xmath34 for @xmath2 .",
    "the estimated spin gap is much more accurate than those obtained so far , under the condition @xmath50 .",
    "in addition , we have discussed how the minimization of the boundary effect is observed from the irf view point .",
    "we have seen that at the best boundary condition at which @xmath35 minimizes the boundary effect , the partial spin average @xmath51 of the first excited state is almost linear in @xmath8 .",
    "to find out such smooth bcs for higher spin cases is our future subject .",
