    "chandra _ as circinus galaxy x-2 @xcite , an ultraluminous source which exhibited many traits of a young supernova ( sn ) interacting with dense circumstellar material ( csm ) .",
    "the circinus galaxy ( circinus ) is a nearby ( 3.8@xmath30.6 mpc ) , massive spiral galaxy situated close to the galactic plane ( @xmath48 ) . due to its location in the sky , suffers from @xmath5  @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) due to our own galaxy as determined by radio and infrared measurements , and @xmath8@xmath9  @xmath6 ( @xmath101.52.5 ) internally based on column density constraints .",
    "a high quality vlt fors  i spectrum of sn  1996cr taken on 2006 jan 26 ( fig .",
    "[ fig ] ) confirms it as a type  iin sn .",
    "the spectrum is dominated by several narrow emission lines ( e.g. , h@xmath11 , [ nii ] , and [ sii ] ; fwhm@xmath0 700  km  s@xmath12 ) , as well as several strong , complex emission lines of [ oi ] , [ oii ] , [ oiii ] comprised of several partially blended broad emission lines ( fwhm@xmath020003000  km  s@xmath12 ) which are red- and blue - shifted with respect to rest wavelengths .",
    "such features imply that the rapidly moving sn material is plowing into a clumpy dense csm and driving slower shocks into them .",
    "the strong , distinct oxygen peaks suggest the ejecta are perhaps located in a few asymmetric , oxygen - rich shells or rings .",
    "narrow - band imaging observations of circinus with the taurus fabry - perot instrument on the anglo australian telescope between 1995 february 2128 and 1996 march 1520 constrain s explosion date to within @xmath01  yr . from these images",
    ", we estimate to be @xmath13 , or at least @xmath14 when corrected for expected extinction .",
    "this provides a strong lower limit , given the explosion date and extinction uncertainties , and indicates that was at least of average peak brightness among type  ii sne @xcite .",
    "while the optical data provide the tightest constraints on the explosion date , the plentiful archival and radio data offer invaluable constraints on the surrounding environment .",
    "we plot together the soft and hard fluxes , as well as radio flux densities in a variety of bands ( fig .",
    "[ fig ] ) .",
    "the early and radio upper limits imply the presence of either strong early absorption or a low - density cavity immediately surrounding the progenitor .",
    "when finally detected , the 0.52 and 210 kev fluxes are best - fitted as @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , whereas nearly all sne are expected to decline as @xmath15 @xmath18@xmath19 @xcite ( although observationally there is more scatter @xcite ) .",
    "this decade - long rise in the is most unusual and has only been observed for @xcite and marginally for @xcite ; thus may be an intermediate object between the extremes of and more typical , luminous sne .",
    "s rise at radio wavelengths exhibits an unusual convex spectral shape which is poorly fit by conventional models @xcite and argues against prolonged early absorption .",
    "the strong and radio emission imply that the csm is quite dense ( @xmath20  @xmath21  yr@xmath12 ) , while the lack of broad h@xmath11 suggests that the hydrogen shell was likely cast off prior to explosion .",
    "this points to a massive , stripped - core progenitor , perhaps similar to the luminous blue variable @xmath22 _ carinae _ @xcite .",
    "notably , the most recent and radio data demonstrate that is already one of the brightest and radio sn on the sky and will likely climb even higher .",
    "thus future monitoring observations should place important constraints on the evolution and nature of the progenitor .",
    "within temporal and positional errors we find that coincides with batse / grb 4b  960202 @xcite .",
    "the strict prescription of @xcite yields a probability of 4.6% , although this probability is dominated by a few very poorly located sources , while our candidate has a smaller than average @xmath23 positional error of 088 ; the probability that one of the 65 possible candidates instead falls within @xmath24088 of is only 0.3% . while intriguing , this association remains weak due to the wide range in explosion dates .",
    "the link is plausible , however , since the potential progenitor of appears stripped of its outer envelope , a necessary condition postulated for grb progenitors @xcite . at the distance of circinus ,",
    "4b  960202 would have an observed luminosity of @xmath25  ergs  s@xmath12 , making it the least luminous grb detected to date ; typical grbs have @xmath26  ergs  s@xmath12 and even the meager grb  980425 was @xmath27  ergs  s@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "4b  960202 s apparently weak luminosity could have several causes .",
    "for instance , it could have been intrinsically weak ; the underlying physical model that produces grbs is believed to generate a broad range of luminosities .",
    "4b  960202 could simply lie on the weak tail , perhaps even in the regime of `` failed '' grbs , whereby the progenitor may not have shed enough of its outer envelope , forcing the jet to expend the bulk of its energy tunneling out . or we could simply be viewing the grb off - axis and only be seeing a very small percentage of the overall beamed energy .",
    "we note that there are two other type  ii sne found to be marginally coincident with grbs @xcite : sn  1999e ( grb  980910 , @xmath28 ) and sn  1997cy ( grb  970514 , @xmath29 ) . while the progenitors of these two sn were likely massive stars ,",
    "both sne show broad h@xmath11 indicative of a relatively intact progenitor which is at odds theoretically with grb formation mechanisms @xcite .",
    "both grbs are also significantly underluminous .",
    "taken together , these objects may signal that the physical engines which inevitably drive grbs may be relatively common in core - collapse sne .",
