    "the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte )  @xcite has played a highly significant role in the explosive growth of grb studies in the afterglow era .",
    "the rxte contributions have been possible because of its ability to rapidly point to a new target , the sensitivity and high - energy response ( 2 @xmath0 60 kev ) of the pca  @xcite , and the wide - field position - determining capability of the asm  @xcite .",
    "this overview encompasses work through april 2001 .",
    "searches for early x - ray afterglows with the pca have been accomplished mostly by means of rapid pointings ( few hours ) of rxte that direct the pca fov toward the near real time batse `` locburst '' position , when the position has uncertainty less than a few degrees .",
    "in addition early grb positions from the asm , bepposax , and the interplanetary network ( ipn ) have been used as targets .",
    "raster scans of the region with the 1.0 deg ( fwhm ) pca field of view are used to carry out the search ; a detection usually can be localized to a few arc minutes ; fig .",
    "such searches by the rxte / pca are dependent on the schedule of upcoming command contacts , and upon the burst location relative to the current celestial pointing direction of rxte .",
    "the pca typically reached its target within a few hours after notification of the burst location .",

    "24 were triggered by batse locburst notices and 7 by one or more of the rxte / asm , bepposax , and the ipn .",

[ decay ] .    [ t ! ]",
    "the asm , with an instantaneous field of view of @xmath10 sq .",
    "deg . and @xmath840% duty cycle , has upon occasion serendipitously observed a burst in the fov of one of its three scanning shadow cameras ( sscs ) . a detection in a single camera yields a line of position of a few arc minutes by a few degrees .",
    "such an error region can be reduced with ipn lines of position or with pca scans .",
    "less frequently , a grb is detected in both of the two azimuthal cameras that have overlapping fovs ( @xmath8300 sq .",
    "this yields crossed lines of position and an error region of order 10 sq arc min .",
    "this is sufficient for radio and optical searches , though pca or ipn results can further refine the position .",
    "the rate of grb detection in the overlapping fovs was initially expected to be @xmath81 per year .",
    "the actual rate ( see `` 2-ssc '' events in tables  [ table2 ] and [ table3 ] ) turns out to be about twice this because ( 1 ) the x - ray portion of the bursts tends to be longer than the gamma - ray portion and ( 2 ) the asm rotates every 100 s which shifts the fovs 6@xmath11 on the sky .",
    "this shift can bring a fov onto a long - duration burst .",
    "it can also bring a camera onto a burst that had just been observed with the other azimuthal camera , thus providing crossed lines of position .    in 5.2 years of operation , up to the present ( april 2001 ) a total of 27 probable grbs",
    "have been detected in the asm .",
    "of these 24 are confirmed as grbs by gamma - ray detectors on other satellites ; table  [ table2 ] .",
    "ten of these were detected in 2 sscs and three were located in a recent global reprocessing of the entire data base .",
    "the asm also recorded at least three other events for which there has been no reported gamma burst from other satellites ; table  [ table3 ] .",
    "each of the listed events has a hard x - ray spectrum , is at high galactic latitude , and is a one - time detection .",
    "thus they could be x - ray bright grbs .",
    "two of these appear to be afterglow detections as no fast variability is apparent during the 100-s asm exposures .",
    "the asm has been providing rapid celestial positions to the community since the commencement of the afterglow era in 1997 ; to this date 12 such positions have been reported , sometimes in conjunction with ipn reports . of these , four were observed in two cameras and hence yielded small uncertainties in two dimensions .",

    "these data provide valuable information in a band not typically monitored by gamma - ray experiments .",
    "( but note , e.g. , the x - ray detections of grbs ( @xmath23 kev ) with ginga  @xcite and with the currently operational wfc on bepposax  @xcite . )    the asm in conjunction with gamma - ray detectors on batse , bepposax , ulysses , konus , and near have yielded multifrequency light curves over the range 1.5 to @xmath21300 kev .",

    "for example , the pronounced 3rd asm peak of grb 970815 is not detected in the upper batse energy bands .",
    "this peak could represent the beginning of the afterglow in the external shock model  @xcite .",
    "this supposition is supported by ( 1 ) the @xmath24s delay of the peak time in the highest asm energy channel ( @xmath87 kev ) relative to that of the lowest channel ( @xmath82.25 kev ) and ( 2 ) the achromatic decay of this peak , with decay indices in each of the 3 asm energy channels consistent with @xmath25 .",

    "these inconsistencies are probably indicative of complex interactions that violate the assumption of a single infusion of energy followed by cooling through radiation .",
    "the rxte will continue to contribute occasional additional positions , light curves , and decay indices of grbs with increased reliance on asm self - triggered events and on ipn crossing lines of positions and confirmations , now that batse is no longer in orbit .",
    "most important , the rxte / pca has the unique potential to acquire a hete burst extremely rapidly , say within 1/2 hour of the burst and to study the temporal activity in the afterglow with high statistics , a domain not heretofore explored .",
