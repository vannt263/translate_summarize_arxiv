    "much effort has been spent to understand the effects of the matter creation process on the universe evolution[1 - 7 ] . in the framework of the friedman - robertson - walker ( frw )",
    "geometries , a self - consistent phenomenological description for matter creation has recently been proposed by prigogine and coworkers@xcite .",
    "the leitmotiv of this approach is that the matter creation process , at the expense of the gravitational field , can happen only as an irreversible process constrained by the usual requirements of nonequilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "the crucial ingredient , however , is the explicit use of a balance equation to the number density of created particles in addition to the einstein field equations(efe ) . when properly combined with the second law of thermodynamics , such an equation leads naturally to a reinterpretation of the stress tensor , corresponding to an additional pressure term , which in turn , depends on the matter creation rate .",
    "an extended manifestly covariant version of such a formulation has also appeared in the literature@xcite .",
    "the nonequivalence between the matter creation process and the mechanism of bulk viscosity , which has been widely used in the literature as a phenomenological description to the former , has been recently clarified@xcite . in connection to this , we remark that the general thermodynamic properties of the formulation by prigogine and coworkers has been more carefully investigated than its dynamic counterpart , which was also presented in the mentioned papers as a new example of nontraditional cosmology .    in this article",
    "we focus our attention on the cosmological scenario proposed in refs.@xcite .",
    "as will be seen , our study will provide some general results often useful to bring forward certain subtleties in the cosmological solutions which apparently were not perceived at first by the mentioned authors . to be more specific , in the scenario proposed in the quoted papers ,",
    "the spacetime starts from a minkowski phase at @xmath9 , with a particle number density @xmath10 describing the initial fluctuation ( cf .",
    ", for instance , @xcite , pg .",
    "773 ) . as will be shown here",
    ", however , there is no initial fluctuation since the minkowski spacetime starts at @xmath2 with a number of particles precisely equal to zero , as it should be .",
    "subsequently , these models evolve smoothly to a de sitter phase , in such a way that at @xmath9 all solutions describe an expanding ( inflationary ) flat frw - type universe .",
    "another unnoticed aspect is related to the existence of a new large class of solutions starting from a big - bang frw singularity and also approaching de sitter spacetime for late cosmological times .",
    "for all values of the parameter of the equation of state @xmath11 , the starting point of the flat universes depend critically on a dimensionless parameter closely related to the matter creation rate .",
    "it can also be shown that all expanding solutions converge to a flat inflating de sitter solution .",
    "in other words , the latter is an attractor independent of initial conditions .    using phase space portrait techniques",
    ", the above analysis is extended to curved spacetimes . due to degeneracy in flat space , the class of models proposed by prigogine _",
    "is shown to split into two distinct classes .",
    "in particular , it is shown that only de sitter and a space - like singularity ( big crunch ) are attracting nodes ( stable points ) in the phase space of solutions .",
    "for the first class , the former attractor is independent of the initial conditions , that is , all expanding solutions end up like a inflating de sitter spacetime regardless of the values of the curvature parameter .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , the basic equations describing a frw - type cosmology with matter creation are presented . in section 3",
    "we discuss the flat case for a matter content satisfying the @xmath12-law equation of state . the flat dust model proposed by prigogine _",
    "is discussed in detail and a second set of exact frw - type solutions not foreseen by those authors are established .",
    "finally , in section 4 we develop a qualitative analysis in order to investigate the curvature effects .",
    "the matter creation ansatz of refs.@xcite is generalized and its dynamic consequences are discussed .",
    "consider now the homogeneous and isotropic frw line element @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the scale factor and @xmath15 is the curvature parameter . throughout",
    "we use units such that @xmath16 .    in that background , the basic dynamic equations for a self - gravitating perfect fluid endowed with matter creation",
    "reduce to @xcite :    0.2 cm _ i _ ) einstein s field equations(efe ) :    @xmath17    @xmath18    whereas the energy conservation law ,    @xmath19    is the usual consistency condition contained in the independent efe ( [ ee1 ] ) and ( [ ee2 ] ) . in the above equations , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23",

    "@xcite . as shown there , the prigogine et al .",
    "formulation is recovered in the ",
    "adiabatic limit \" , namely when @xmath1 is different from zero but the specific entropy ( per particle ) is constant . from now on ,",
    "we consider just the `` adiabatic case '' for which the @xmath28 parameter is given by ( see refs.@xcite )    @xmath29    with the creation pressure assuming the following form    @xmath30    in order to obtain a definite cosmological scenario with matter creation , one still needs to provide two additional relations : the equation of state and the matter creation rate . in the cosmological domain , the former",
    "is usually expressed in terms of the  gamma - law \" equation of state ,    @xmath31    where @xmath12 is the  adiabatic index \" .",
    "note that , from ( [ ee1 ] ) , ( [ ee2 ] ) , ( [ pc_def ] ) and ( [ g_law ] ) , the evolution equation for the scale factor @xmath14 can be written as    @xmath32    which depends only on the matter creation rate @xmath1 and the number density of particles @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore , using ( [ cons_en ] ) , ( [ bal_n ] ) and ( [ pc_def ] ) , it is easy to show that @xmath33 and @xmath21 satisfy the general relation ( see ref.@xcite )    @xmath34    so that , using the efe ( [ ee1 ] ) one can obtain @xmath35 , with eq.([rdot ] ) now depending only on @xmath1 .    in",
    "what follows , we will first discuss the simple and exactly integrable flat case ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "this class includes prigogine _ et al . _",
    "s dust model @xcite .",
    "the contributions of curvature terms will be analyze in section 4 , but for now it suffices to say that flat solutions are not necessarily stable with respect to curvature perturbations . in the language of dynamical systems , frw cosmology without matter creation",
    "is  structurally stable \" with respect to curvature perturbations , while models with matter creation are not .",
    "let us now discuss the flat case . in terms of the hubble parameter the evolution equation ( [ rdot ] ) for the scale factor reduces to :    @xmath37    while from ( [ ee1 ] ) and ( [ n_rho ] )",
    "the particle number density @xmath33 assume the form below ,    @xmath38    now , in order to properly generalize the dust universe of refs.@xcite we consider a class of models endowed with the same matter creation rate    @xmath39    in the above expression @xmath40 is a new phenomenological parameter ( @xmath41 in the notation of refs.@xcite ) .",
    "parenthetically , since we are dealing with a spatially flat spacetime , the above equation implies that @xmath1 is proportional to the energy density , more precisely , @xmath42 .",
    "of course , these relations are not equivalent in curved spacetimes , and so doing we are effectively working with two different creation rates ( see section 4 ) .    inserting eqs.([n_h_flat ] ) and ( [ rate_h2 ] ) into ( [ hdot_flat ] ) one obtains @xmath43 = 0 \\quad \\quad       ( \\gamma \\neq 2 ) \\quad , \\ ] ] and    @xmath44    in eqs.([n_h_flat])-([hdot_flat_g=2 ] ) , @xmath10 is the value of @xmath33 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 is given by    @xmath47    the case @xmath48 is the simplest one to be analyzed .",
    "however , since it does not exhibit the peculiarities present in the class of solutions of ( [ hdot_flat_gd2 ] ) , which contains the model of refs .",
    "@xcite , we do not consider it in what follows .",
    "apart from some interpretation problems , prigogine s et al .",
    "model must be recovered by taking @xmath49 in the general solution of ( [ hdot_flat_gd2 ] ) . a straightforward integration of this later equation yields    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is a dimensional integration constant .",
    "now , in order to introduce in our approach a useful dimensionless parameter , we compute the value of @xmath51 as a function of @xmath46 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , where @xmath53 is the value of @xmath14 when @xmath45 . from ( [ h_sol ] )",
    "one reads    @xmath54    where    @xmath55    in terms of @xmath0 the hubble parameter takes the form    @xmath56^      { \\frac{\\gamma}{2-\\gamma } } \\quad , \\ ] ]    and from ( [ n_h_flat ] ) and ( [ h_sol])-([def_si ] ) , the particle number density is given by    @xmath57        ^{\\frac{2}{2-\\gamma } } \\quad , \\ ] ]    with the time - dependent net number of particles , @xmath58 , assuming the following form :    @xmath59      ^{\\frac{2}{2-\\gamma } } \\quad .\\ ] ]    for these models , the qualitative behavior at early and late times can be easily determined from eqs.([h_si ] ) and ( [ n_si ] ) or ( [ number ] ) . if @xmath3 , the hubble parameter is constant , @xmath60 , with the solutions reducing to a flat de sitter - type universe regardless of the value of @xmath12 .",
    "in this way , we may have , for instance , a de sitter universe supported by the adiabatic creation of photons ( @xmath61 ) or dust ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "such a fact had already been observed in ref.@xcite .",
    "indeed , @xmath60 is a special solution , a singular point in the phase diagram of the system @xmath62 , @xmath63 ( see eqs.([hdot ] ) and ( [ rhodot ] ) in section 4 ) .",
    "it should be noticed that for large values of @xmath14 , that is , @xmath64 , the models evolve to this inflating solution .",
    "how these flat universes emerge depends only on the sign of @xmath51 or equivalently , if the dimensionless parameter @xmath0 is bigger , smaller or equal unity . for @xmath65 ,",
    "the second term on the rhs of ( [ h_si ] ) is dominant for small values of @xmath14 , that is , @xmath66 , thereby leading to the usual frw singularity , @xmath67 .",
    "since @xmath68 in this limit , it follows from ( [ n_rho ] ) and ( [ n_h_flat ] ) that @xmath21 and @xmath33 are infinite as @xmath69 goes to zero .",
    "these results characterize a class of singular solutions not previously perceived in refs.@xcite .    on the other hand , if @xmath70 it follows from ( [ h_si ] ) that there is a minimal value of @xmath14 , namely :    @xmath71    for which @xmath72 . in addition , eqs.([n_rho ] ) , ( [ n_h_flat ] ) and ( [ n_si ] ) , yield @xmath73 at @xmath74 , making explicit that such models start , for all values of @xmath12 , as a minkowski vacuum .",
    "we remark that , from ( [ pc_def ] ) and ( [ n_h_flat ] ) , the creation pressure @xmath75 scales with @xmath76 .",
    "thus , according to the above results , in the beginning of the universe the creation pressure was either zero or infinite if , respectively , @xmath77 or @xmath78 . only in the de sitter case ( @xmath3 )",
    "the creation pressure has a finite(and constant ) value .",
    "the above results are rather important in what follows . for @xmath79",
    "one obtains @xmath45 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 for all values of @xmath12 and @xmath82 . for @xmath3 , ( [ h_si ] ) and ( [ n_si ] )",
    "reduce to the constant values @xmath60 and @xmath80 as required by the symmetries of the de sitter spacetime .",
    "the latter case is different from the de sitter phase attained in the course of the evolution for @xmath82 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath83 , ( [ n_si ] ) yields    @xmath84    which may also be obtained from ( [ n_h_flat ] ) taking @xmath60 . the important point to keep in mind here",
    "is that models starting as minkowski ( @xmath70 ) have @xmath85 when @xmath74 , that is , @xmath10 can not be the number density at the beginning of the universe .",
    "therefore , since for @xmath49 the energy density is @xmath86 ( where @xmath87 is the mass of the created dust particles ) we can say that the authors of refs.@xcite studied only the case @xmath70 , that is , @xmath88 .",
    "note that @xmath10 and @xmath40 are coupled to give the natural mass scale of the models so that for @xmath49 the condition @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) assumes the interesting form @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) , where the critical mass is @xmath93 , just the mass of the particles created in the de sitter spacetime .",
    "for this steady state scenario , we see from ( 5 ) and ( 13 ) that @xmath94 , and using the present data it is readily obtained @xmath95 i.e. , the proton mass .",
    "naturally , the above condition may also be translated as a constraint on @xmath40 , the free parameter of the models . in terms of the mass @xmath87 ,",
    "the critical value of this parameter is given by @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the planck mass .",
    "in contrast with the approach developed here , the mass of the created particles in refs.@xcite has been estimated by assuming that the de sitter phase is unstable and evolves continuously ( up to first derivatives ) to the frw radiation phase .",
    "let us now analyze with more detail the case @xmath49 .",
    "as remarked above , in this case @xmath99 , so that ( [ def_hd ] ) and ( [ n_lim ] ) reduce to    @xmath100    and    @xmath101    the aforementioned results are presented , respectively , in eqs.(20 ) and ( 4 ) of refs.@xcite . now , in order to relate ( [ hd_3 ] ) and ( [ n_3 ] ) with the characteristic time scale of the de sitter phase we insert ( [ hd_3 ] ) into ( [ h_si ] ) and integrate it with @xmath98 and @xmath70 to obtain    @xmath102}^{2/3 } \\quad , \\ ] ]    which is the same expression for the scale function presented in refs.@xcite .",
    "therefore , after a characteristic time @xmath103 , the universe reaches the de sitter phase expanding as    @xmath104    where @xmath105 and @xmath46 were defined by ( [ hd_3 ] ) and ( [ n_3 ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", it follows from ( [ r_min ] ) that the minimal value of @xmath14 for @xmath49 is given by    @xmath106^{2/3 } \\quad , \\ ] ]    which depends on @xmath10 through @xmath0 .",
    "hence , if we consider @xmath107 as in refs.@xcite , one has @xmath108 , with ( [ r_min_3 ] ) making explicit the constraint @xmath70 as noticed earlier .",
    "of course , the natural choice is to take not @xmath53 but @xmath109 .",
    "however , the important step is to determine at what time the scale factor assumes its minimal value @xmath110 . from ( [ r_3 ] ) we see that @xmath74 only if @xmath2 , which is coherent with our qualitative analysis .",
    "note that for @xmath9 ( [ r_3 ] ) yields @xmath79 and , ( [ n_si ] ) , @xmath80 . in this context",
    "we remark that the authors of refs.@xcite truncated arbitrarily the time coordinate at @xmath9 , and since the arbitrary value of @xmath53 has been fixed equal to unity , they obtained @xmath111 ; in their words :  the universe emerges without singularity at @xmath9 , with a particle number density @xmath10 describing the initial minkowskian fluctuation \" ( see ref.@xcite , pg.773 ) .",
    "indeed , for @xmath9 , in addition to @xmath79 and @xmath80 , one obtains from ( [ n_h_flat ] ) or equivalently from ( [ def_hd ] ) , ( [ def_si ] ) and ( [ h_si ] ) that the hubble parameter itself is @xmath45 , making it clear that the spacetime is not minkowski .",
    "it thus follows that at @xmath9 the solution ( [ r_3 ] ) describes an expanding frw - type universe driven by the matter creation process .",
    "indeed , such a result is valid for all values of @xmath12 in the considered interval and @xmath82 . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the extension of the time coordinate for @xmath112 may also be justified looking for the expression of the total number of particles given by ( [ number ] ) . by taking @xmath49 in the later equation and replacing the expression of @xmath14 given in ( [ r_3 ] ) one obtains    @xmath113    which is the same expression derived in refs .",
    "@xcite using a different approach .",
    "notice that the minkowskian limit , @xmath114 , is recovered only if @xmath115 in accordance with our previous comments , while for @xmath9 or equivalently @xmath79 one has @xmath116 , as it should be .",
    "despite the fact that this `` initial fluctuation '' @xmath10 does not exist , it will be shown that there is a structural instability related with these types of models , which may be discussed using the dynamical systems technique ( see section 4 ) .",
    "summarizing , this class of spacetimes ( @xmath70 ) , which includes the dust case , emerges at @xmath2 as a true minkowski spacetime , that is , @xmath117 and @xmath74 , with a general expression given by ( [ r_min ] ) .",
    "there is no initial fluctuation . due to the matter creation process",
    ", the universe evolves smoothly from minkowski to a de sitter spacetime .",
    "this is an interesting example of spacetimes which are unbounded in time , that is , their evolution ranges the time interval ( @xmath118 ) and are also free of physical singularities .",
    "naturally , the characteristic quantities of the de sitter phase may , for certain special values of @xmath12 , be independent of @xmath10 ; a particular value of @xmath33 arbitrarily fixed at @xmath9 .",
    "this is not remarkable and happens just for @xmath49 as a consequence of the relation @xmath119 ( see eqs.([hd_3 ] ) , ( [ n_3 ] ) and the definition of @xmath120 ) .",
    "having in mind that the case @xmath3 is trivial we now analyze the last possibility , that is , @xmath77 or @xmath122 . in this case , as expected , eq.([h_si ] ) is not modified , but on the other hand there is no @xmath110 , so that @xmath123 and @xmath68 , characterizing an initial frw - type singularity . taking into account such remarks in the integration process of ( [ h_si ] ) , it is easily found , for @xmath49 ,    @xmath124^{2/3 } \\quad .\\ ] ]    this expression is consistent with our earlier qualitative analysis . for times",

    "the flat case have already showed striking richness , and a natural extension to curved spacetimes is already more than justified . however , since is rather difficult to analytically derive the complete set of solutions , we will employ a different approach provided by the qualitative analysis of dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to reduce the field equations to a bidimensional autonomous system and perform the qualitative analysis of all solutions .",
    "as we know , the first step is set up a convenient set of dynamic variables , which we choose as being the energy density @xmath21 and the hubble parameter @xmath131 .",
    "using the definition @xmath132 and the constraint ( [ ee1 ] ) we rewrite ( [ rdot ] ) as    @xmath133    the second dynamical equation is just the energy conservation law([cons_en ] ) . inserting ( [ pc_def ] ) and ( [ g_law ] ) it takes the following form    @xmath134    since the ratio @xmath135 is a function of the energy density or hubble parameter ( or some combination of them ) our dynamical system is fully defined by eqs.([hdot ] ) and ( [ rhodot ] ) . in what follows",
    "we consider only a positive - definite @xmath12 .",
    "first of all , we remark that the flat solutions corresponding to @xmath136 are reconstructed in the phase space irrespectively of the matter creation rate .",
    "in fact , taking the ratio of ( [ hdot ] ) to ( [ rhodot ] ) we see that the parabola @xmath136 corresponds to the solutions for the flat case .",
    "therefore , such a curve is a separatrix for the general solutions even in presence of matter creation .",
    "this is just a reminder that ( [ ee1 ] ) constrains open and closed spacetimes in such a way that they can not evolve into one another . in general",

    "the shape of solutions is kept intact near the origin of the transformed graph . as expected , for these simple frw models we are able to find exact expressions to the integral curves shown in fig.1 , since we know these systems to be integrable ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "at this point we should recall that although in flat spacetimes the energy density and hubble parameter are indistinguishable , in curved spacetimes this is not so . in this way ,",
    "the ansatz proposed in refs.@xcite , @xmath163 , must be somewhat generalized to include the presence of curvature . in principle , if we mimic the bulk viscosity mechanism , a more reasonable phenomenological law for @xmath164 should be a power - law dependence @xmath165 , where @xmath166 is a dimensional constant and @xmath167 ( see , for instance , ref.@xcite ) . in this case , regardless of the curvature parameter , the prigogine et al .",
    "ansatz corresponds to @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "however , this kind of phenomenological law does not include the case @xmath170 ( @xmath40 constant ) , discussed in ref.@xcite . in this connection",

    "as noted above , a general feature of models with matter creation is the presence of a de sitter solution .",
    "it is easy to see how these solutions come up : consider the curve @xmath173 corresponding to the equality @xmath174 which , from eqs.([hdot])-([rhodot ] ) always crosses the parabola @xmath175 ( or , equivalently , the straight line @xmath176 of fig.1 ) . at that precise point",
    "@xmath177 $ ] ( hereafter indicated as @xmath178 ) , it is readily seen that both @xmath179 and @xmath180 are zero , meaning an exponentially expanding universe with constant density , i.e. , an inflating universe . the question of whether models evolve towards it or outwards from it is related to the nature of the singular point @xmath178 .",
    "this is done by finding the liapunov coefficients of the linearized dynamical system at that point @xcite .",
    "for the matter creation rate of the form assumed above , after some simple algebra we find    @xmath181 and    @xmath182 this means that the fixed point @xmath178 is either a saddle point , an attracting jordan node or a simple attracting node ( attractor ) , if @xmath183 , @xmath184 or @xmath185 respectively .",
    "the absence of complex liapunov coefficients for any @xmath12 or @xmath40 guarantees no closed orbits around @xmath178 , which is obvious given the constraint ( [ ee1 ] ) and the discussion after eq.([rhodot ] ) .",
    "the reader may verify for himself that @xmath186 is negative if we consider @xmath187 , since in this case @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",

    "the phase portrait is shown in fig.2 . as explained",
    ", the point @xmath178 is an attractor , and all expanding solutions converge there . since @xmath72 ( @xmath190 in fig.2 ) is a line of singular points , expanding and contracting models are never in contact .",
    "such an effect is probably due to the creation pressure @xmath75 which diverges at that line ( see eq.([pc_def ] ) ) .",
    "actually , it is easy to see that all along line @xmath190 the rate @xmath180 ( see eq.([hdot ] ) ) goes to infinity .    in this model",
    ", the expanding universe seems to have appeared either from a frw - type singularity at @xmath191 ( @xmath144 , @xmath176 ) , or at any point in the singular line @xmath190 .",
    "in other words , all expanding spacetimes evolved from a singularity of some kind .",
    "even minkowski ( denoted @xmath192 ) , which is a nonsingular saddle point in frw models ( see fig.1 ) , is a multiple equilibrium singular point here .",
    "note also that closed universes show no turning points , either expanding or contracting forever .",
    "contracting universes in this scheme can begin either from minkowski or from the same singular line as the expanding ones , @xmath190 .",
    "all solutions now evolve to a crunch , exactly as in the frw case . in the region of negative energy ( left half of fig.2 ) ,",
    "contracting universes emerge either from the singular line @xmath190 or from @xmath192 , and finish with infinite negative energy at ( @xmath144 , @xmath193 ) . expanding universes with negative energy",
    "all start from @xmath194 , and end up as flat empty universes at @xmath192 . in sum , if the universe described by this model started from a fluctuation with both @xmath195 and @xmath196 , it would evolve towards the inflating universe at @xmath178 .",
    "on the other hand , if it started from a curvature fluctuation ( @xmath197 , @xmath198 ) , it would certainly end up either in a crunch or in an empty minkowski spacetime .",
    "the case of a matter fluctuation ( @xmath72 , @xmath199 ) is somewhat ill - defined , since @xmath75 diverges on the line @xmath190 .",
    "in this paper , by allowing both pressure and curvature , we have generalized the flat pre - inflationary stage with matter creation proposed by prigogine and coworkers .",
    "all expanding solutions evolve to the flat de sitter spacetime in the infinite cosmic time of their evolution .",
    "physically , open and closed models are always singular , while the flat solutions split into two distinct subclasses which depend on the matter creation rate .",
    "the beginning of the universe in this case may be either a minkowskian vacuum or a frw type singularity .",
    "the avoidance of a singularity depends on the strength of the matter creation process , which has been translated here as a condition on the dimensionless @xmath0 parameter .",
    "it thus appear that a certain degree of fine tuning is needed in order to escape from a physical singularity in these models .",
