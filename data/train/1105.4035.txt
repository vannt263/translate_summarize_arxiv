    "besides the well known @xmath6 11-year solar cycle , solar activity varies on many short - time scales ( a few minutes to a few years ) and many long time scales ( a few decades to the sun s evolution time scale ) .",
    "it has been generally accepted that interactions of the sun s differential rotation ( dr ) and the solar magnetic field play a basic role in generation of solar activity . however , the exact role of the dr in the variations of the solar activity is not known and the mechanism of solar cycle is not yet fully understood .",
    "therefore , studies on the temporal variations of the dr are important for understanding the role of the dr in the solar variability . so far many attempts have been made to determine the varitions in the dr and detected several periodicities in the dr by using the different data and different techniques ( @xmath8 , * ? ? ?",

    "the 11-year torsional oscillations were discovered by  @xcite , using mt .",
    "wilson doppler velocity measurements have been confirmed using different data sets and methods  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the torsional oscillations consist of alternating bands of faster and slower than average rotation moving from high latitudes toward the equator .",
    "the faster than average bands start at mid - latitudes of about @xmath9 during the minimum phase of the solar cycle and move equatorward with the rising phase of the new cycle .",
    "the bands extend over about @xmath10 in latitude .",
    "the faster than average rotation band is located on the equatorward side of the magnetic activity belt and a slower than average rotation band is located on its poleward side .",
    "thus , it is thought that the torsional oscillations are associated with magnetic shear . at high latitudes , the rotation changes from slower to faster than average at ( or just after ) the solar maximum , which might be related to the polarity reversal of polar magnetic fields , and remains faster than average to the next solar minimum without clear migratory character .",
    "helioseismic observations show that the torsional oscillations are not just a superficial phenomenon but they extend to at least the upper third of the solar convection zone  @xcite .",
    "variations on the few other time scales in the coefficients of solar differential rotation  @xcite and the residual rotation  @xcite , including one which is approximately equal to the gleissberg cycle , have been found using sunspot group data .",
    "it is known that the total solar irradiance ( tsi ) varies by about 0.1% over the solar cycle .",
    "a number of statistical models of tsi variability have been constructed on the basis of inhomogeneities of surface magnetic field .",
    "these models helped to identify the surface magnetic structures ( sunspots and faculae ) responsible for variations in tsi and also provided widely accepted theoretical explanations .",
    "however , the exact mechanism behind the tsi variation is not known  @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that a significant part of the solar cycle variation in tsi is a result of the temporal changes in the latitude - dependent surface temperature of the sun .",
    "these authors speculated that the dr ( turbulent reynolds tresses and their perturbations ) has a role in tsi variability .",
    "besides the @xmath6 11-year periodicity , tsi also seems to vary on timescales which are much shorter than 11-year .",
    "for example , a @xmath6 10-day periodicity is found to be prominent in the short variations of tsi  @xcite and the existence of a @xmath6 30-day periodicity in the proxies of tsi is reported  ( @xmath8 , * ? ? ? * )",
    ". however , the amplitudes of the short variations of tsi depend on the phase of a solar cycle  ( @xmath8 , * ? ? ? * ) . in the present analysis",

    "however , the 1.3-year periodicity in the variation of the low and the middle latitudes rotation rate near the base of the convection zone , that was detected by @xcite from helioseismic measurements during the period 19951999 , is also found to be not persisting after 2001 @xcite .",
