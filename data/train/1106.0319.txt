    "spherical couette flow , i.e. the flow between differentially rotating concentric spheres , has attracted a revival of interest in recent years .",
    "it has been shown that despite the simplicity of the problem , the flow undergoes many bifurcations as reynolds number increases , depending in ratios of sphere radii and rotation speeds .",
    "when one considers an electrically conducting fluid and imposes magnetic field , magnetohydrodynamic effects can significantly change the purely hydrodynamical problem and lead to new instabilities .",
    "this problem has evident consequences in geophysical and astrophysical contexts ( stars , planetary interiors ) , where setups similar to magnetized spherical couette flow are often encountered .",
    "this problem has also been extensively studied in cylindrical taylor - couette flow , i.e. the viscous flow between two differentially rotating concentric cylinders .",
    "this interest in magnetized conducting fluids confined by rotating walls has been renewed in the last decade by investigation of the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) in the laboratory .",
    "the mri is currently the best candidate to explain angular momentum transport in accretion disks around stars and black holes @xcite .",
    "balbus and hawley , rediscovering an instability first studied by velikhov@xcite and chandrasekhar @xcite , have shown that a weak magnetic field can destabilize otherwise stable keplerian flows .",
    "the mri eventually yields a magnetohydrodynamical turbulent state , enhancing the angular momentum transport and allowing inward flow , as observed in accretion disks .",
    "several experiments are currently working on this instability .",
    "the princeton experiment has been designed to observe mri in a taylor - couette flow of liquid gallium , with an axial applied magnetic field @xcite .",
    "so far , mri has not been identified , but non - axisymmetric modes have been observed when a strong magnetic field is imposed @xcite . the promise experiment , in dresden , is based on a similar set - up , except that the applied field possesses an azimuthal component .",
    "axisymmetric traveling waves have been obtained , and identified as being helical mri , an inductionless instability different from but connected to the standard mri @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , spherical couette flows have been widely studied , through theoretical analyses , laboratory experiments , and numerical simulations .",
    "for instance , without magnetic field but for sufficiently large reynolds numbers , it is known that the flow can be hydrodynamically unstable to a rich variety of axisymmetric and non - axisymmetric modes .",
    "when a magnetic field is applied , additional magnetohydrodynamic effects are generated .",
    "hollerbach @xcite first shows numerically that a free shear layer is created in the flow when a strong magnetic field is imposed .",
    "this configuration was later asymptotically analyzed by kleeorin et al @xcite and starchenko @xcite .",
    "when the inner sphere is conducting , dormy et al @xcite discovered that imposing a dipolar magnetic field yields a super - rotating jet , that is , a region of fluid with angular velocity larger than either boundary s .",
    "this super - rotation was recently observed experimentally in the dts experiment , using a spherical shell filled with liquid sodium in presence of a dipolar magnetic field imposed by a permanent magnet inside the inner sphere @xcite,@xcite .",
    "more recently , it was shown that several non - axisymmetric instabilities are generated from these magnetized spherical couette flows , including destabilization of the meridional return flow @xcite,@xcite , or from the free shear layers and jets produced by the magnetic field @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a few years ago , it has been claimed that mri was obtained in a spherical couette flow of liquid sodium in maryland @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "in which the outer sphere is at rest and an external axial magnetic field is applied parallel to the rotation axis , non - axisymmetric oscillations of both velocity and magnetic fields have been observed , together with an increase of the torque on the inner sphere . although the instability appears from a hydrodynamical state already turbulent , these oscillations have been interpreted as a signature of the mri .    in this article , we numerically investigate magnetized spherical couette flow for different configurations , including a setup similar to the maryland experiment . in the first section",
    ", we present the equations and the numerical method used to study this problem . in sections",
    "ii and iii , we report numerical simulations with a dipolar magnetic field applied to the flow , and with a rotating outer sphere . we show that magnetized spherical couette flow yield different non - axisymmetric instabilities with a rich variety of structures and non - linear interactions .",
    "we compare our mhd instabilities to the mri , and highlight the striking similarities between both type of instabilities , including the enhancement of angular momentum transport and the transition to mhd turbulence .",
    "finally , our numerical results using an axial magnetic field are directly compared to the maryland experiment .",
    "we consider the flow of an electrically conducting fluid induced in a spherical shell .",
    "the aspect ratio of the inner sphere radius @xmath0 to the outer radius @xmath1 is set to @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 are respectively the angular speed of the inner and the outer sphere .",
    "the governing equations for this problem are the navier - stokes equations coupled to the induction equation : @xmath5 @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the density , @xmath8 the kinematic viscosity , @xmath9 is the electrical resistivity , @xmath10 is the fluid velocity and @xmath11 the magnetic field .",
    "lengths are scaled by the shell gap @xmath12 , and we use the viscous time @xmath13 as a typical time scale .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath11 is scaled by @xmath14 .",
    "the problem is thus characterized by @xmath15 dimensionless numbers : the reynolds number @xmath16 , the magnetic reynolds number @xmath17 and the elsasser number @xmath18 .",
    "it is also useful to define the magnetic prandtl number @xmath19 , which is simply the ratio between reynolds numbers . the magnetic and kinetic energies reported in this article",
    "are respectively scaled by @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and the torques by @xmath22 .",
    "these equations are numerically integrated using the parody code @xcite,@xcite . in this code",
    ", velocity and magnetic fields are decomposed in poloidal and toroidal components and expanded in spherical harmonics . in the radial direction ,",
    "a finite differences method is used on an irregular mesh , which decreases in geometrical progression towards the boundaries .",
    "time stepping is implemented by a crank - nicholson scheme for the diffusive terms and an adams - bashforth for the non - linear terms .",
    "depending on the values of our dimensionless numbers , typical numerical resolutions involve between @xmath23 and @xmath24 radial grid points and between @xmath25 and @xmath23 spherical harmonics degrees and orders .",
    "magnetized spherical couette flow has been largely studied in an interesting series of papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and some of these results are confirmed by the present work .",
    "however , these previous studies rely on the assumption that the magnetic reynolds number @xmath26 can be neglected for very resistive fluids .",
    "this assumption greatly simplifies the governing equations , in particular the time derivative can be omitted from the induction equation ( [ ind ] ) .",
    "this is one of the motivations for the present study , since induction processes could play an important role when describing liquid metal experiments . in particular ,",
    "a finite value of @xmath26 is necessary to observe the standard magnetorotational instability . for instance , in the maryland experiment ( initially designed to observe dynamo action ) , the electrical conductivity of the liquid sodium yields magnetic reynolds numbers up to @xmath27 , meaning that @xmath26 can no longer be neglected in the mhd equations .",
    "in this section and the next one , the inner sphere is rotating such that @xmath28 .",
    "the global rotation of the system is thus relatively weak .",
    "this configuration is particularly interesting in the context of mri experiments . indeed , in a cylindrical geometry",
    ", this choice of the rotation ratio would correspond to a system slightly below the rayleigh stability criterion , but mri unstable .",
    "both spheres are taken insulating and an internal dipolar magnetic field ( held by the inner sphere ) is applied to the system .",

    "it consists of a strong azimuthal flow associated with a poloidal recirculation .",
    "the taylor - proudman theorem states that for a sufficiently strong global rotation of the system , the velocity tends to be uniform in the @xmath32 direction , due to a dominant balance between the pressure gradient and the coriolis force @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the flow outside the tangent cylinder is in solid body rotation with the outer sphere .",
    "the difference of rotation between inner and outer spheres , together with the taylor - proudman constraint , yield the so - called stewartson free shear layer , located on the tangent cylinder @xcite . inside the stewartson layer , the azimuthal flow rapidly varies from the velocity of the outer sphere ( outside the tangent cylinder ) to a velocity intermediate between inner and outer spheres ( inside the tangent cylinder ) .",
    "the structure of the axisymmetric component of the flow for @xmath33 is illustrated in figure [ couette ] , and shows a stewartson layer developing on the tangent cylinder .",
    "note that since these numerical simulations involve a relatively weak global rotation , the stewartson layer is diffuse .",
    "moreover , because of the differential rotation between the inner and the outer sphere , the poloidal recirculation is characterized by a strong equatorial jet in the midplane .",

    "yields a non - axisymmetric instability , strongly dominated by the azimuthal wavenumber @xmath34 ( green squares in figure [ pri_param ] ) .    in figure [ stew ] ( bottom ) , we report the structure of this hydrodynamical instability by showing the non - axisymmetric radial component of the velocity field .",
    "the non - axisymmetric pattern drifts at a constant speed in the azimuthal direction .",
    "a cut in the equatorial plane ( left ) shows the @xmath34 structure of the instability , and the meridional plane ( right ) illustrates its symmetry with respect to the equatorial plane .",
    "following @xcite , we denote this state by symmetric , i.e. velocity and magnetic fields satisfy : @xmath39 whereas antisymmetric modes satisfy : @xmath40    in such spherical couette flows , two distinct situations are generally considered : configurations with a strong global rotation , or configurations with the outer sphere at rest .",
    "two types of instability are thus observed when @xmath41 is increased : in the first case , the stewartson layer is destabilized and rolls up into a series of vortices in the @xmath42 plane , leading to an equatorially symmetric mode localized on the tangent cylinder . in the second case , if @xmath41 is sufficiently large , the strong equatorial jet becomes unstable by adopting a wavy structure , and yields an antisymmetric mode localized in the equatorial plane . in the present configuration ,",
    "global rotation is relatively small and reynolds numbers are large enough for both instabilities to be generated , so the interpretation is not as clear - cut . indeed , as it can be seen in figure [ stew ] , the instability is symmetric with respect to the equator and consists of a series of vortices in the horizontal plane ( i.e. the velocity perturbations are mainly horizontal ) , as it is expected from a stewartson layer instability .",
    "note however that a large part of the energy of the mode is localized in the equatorial plane , suggesting the the system is close to a transition to an equatorial jet instability .    .",

    "figure [ stew ] ( top ) shows a bifurcation diagram of the @xmath34 component of the kinetic and magnetic energies when @xmath35 is increased , for @xmath44 .",
    "it illustrates the inhibiting role of the magnetic field : this @xmath34 non - axisymmetric mode is strongly damped by the applied field .",
    "it is interesting to note that the observation of the magnetic energy alone would rather suggests a destabilizing effect of the magnetic field . for @xmath46 ,",
    "the instability is completely suppressed , and the solution is back to an axisymmetric state .",
    "in addition to this stabilizing effect , the applied magnetic field is also able to drive instabilities . in figure",
    "[ pri_param ] , the red circle indicate non - axisymmetric states , different from the hydrodynamical instabilities described previously .    this has been interpreted as a destabilization of the poloidal return flow by the applied field . in recent inductionless simulations ,",
    "hollerbach @xcite has shown that in the presence of a weak magnetic field , the poloidal return flow is destabilized to a non - axisymmetric state . as the intensity of the magnetic field",
    "is increased , this instability continuously connects to another type of instability related to a free shear layer in the flow . indeed , when a strong magnetic field is applied to a spherical couette flow , the magnetic tension couples fluid elements together along the direction of magnetic field lines",
    "this creates a particular surface @xmath47 in the flow , separating the region where magnetic field lines are connected to both spheres from the region where magnetic field lines are only touching one of the sphere . depending on the region considered",
    ", the flow will behave very differently .",
    "for instance , when the applied field is dipolar , like in this section , @xmath47 is defined by magnetic field lines just touching the outer sphere at the equator . in this case , the fluid inside @xmath47 , coupled only to the inner sphere , co - rotates with it , whereas fluid outside @xmath47 rotates at an intermediate velocity ( except near the sphere boundaries ) .",
    "the jump of velocity on the surface @xmath47 therefore results in a new free layer , the so - called shercliff layer @xcite .",
    "this effect was first described in spherical geometry by starchenko @xcite , who found that the thickness of this layer scales like @xmath48 . like the stewartson layer ,",
    "the shercliff layer becomes unstable to non - axisymmetric perturbations when the shear is strong enough .",
    "however , in the case of a dipolar applied field , the significance of the field lines @xmath47 can be completely eliminated if the reynolds number is large enough @xcite , and only instabilities of the return flow will remain . despite the differences in the geometry of the applied field and in the parameter regime ,",
    "it is surprising to note that our figure [ pri_param ] is very similar to fig.@xmath49 of @xcite .",
    "is increased for a fixed reynolds number @xmath33 .",
    "note the non - axisymmetric destabilization of the meridional return flow by the applied field , dominated by @xmath36 and @xmath34 non - axisymmetric modes .",
    "strong applied fields suppress these mhd instabilities.,height=226 ]    figure [ scherb ] shows the evolution of the non - axisymmetric components of the magnetic field when the elsasser number is increased , for @xmath33 . for this small reynolds number ,",
    "both stewartson layer and equatorial jet are hydrodynamically stable to non - axisymmetric perturbations for @xmath45 .",
    "as @xmath35 is increased from this axisymmetric state , the return flow becomes unstable , and the system undergoes a bifurcation to an @xmath36 rotating mode at @xmath50 ( corresponding to red dots in figure [ pri_param ] ) .",
    "when @xmath35 is increased further , one observes a transfer between this @xmath36 mode and an @xmath34 structure .",
    "figure [ struc_m1 ] shows that the modes are still symmetric with respect to the midplane .",
    "the structure of the instability is similar to the one obtained in @xcite and",
    "the localization of the energy of the mode indeed suggests that the instability is related to the meridional return flow .",
    "note however that close to the threshold , our large @xmath26 calculations lead to the generation of an @xmath36 mode , whereas inductionless simulations of @xcite predicted an @xmath34 mode .",
    "when @xmath36 and @xmath34 azimuthal modes are both excited , a phase locking is achieved between these two modes , and nonlinear interactions can become important .",
    "finally , if the elsasser number is increased up to @xmath51 , the magnetic tension of the applied magnetic field suppresses any instability , and the system comes back to an axisymmetric state .    .",

    "at this point , we would like to briefly compare these instabilities , mainly due to the presence of boundaries , to what would be expected in a cylindrical geometry .",
    "chandrasekhar @xcite and velikhov @xcite first studied the effect of an axial applied magnetic field on a couette flow confined between two infinite cylinders .",
    "they considered rotations of the cylinders such that the flow is stable under the centrifugal instability . according to the rayleigh criterion",
    ", this means that the rotation profile follows @xmath54 , with @xmath55 .",
    "however , this flow can be destabilized by applying an magnetic field to the system if @xmath56 . this powerful magnetorotational instability ( mri ) ,",
    "later rediscovered by balbus and hawley in the framework of accretion disks , yields a radial outflow of angular momentum and can lead to an mhd turbulent state .",
    "the magnetic field can also have a stabilizing effect : for unstable flow satisfying @xmath57 , the magnetic field is able to suppress the centrifugal instability @xcite . finally , the mri is also suppressed if the applied magnetic field is too strong .    despite the fact that mri is generally considered as a local instability ( without regard to the boundaries of the system ) ,",
    "it is interesting to note that most of the above features are encountered in the instabilities of our finite geometry system .",
    "first , figure [ pri_param ] shows that the mhd instability is excited only in a delimited pocket in the parameter space : it requires a finite value of the magnetic field to be unstable , but is stabilized if the applied magnetic field is too strong .",
    "second , the critical value of the elsasser number for restabilization rapidly increases with @xmath26 , similarly to the magnetorotational instability .",
    "in addition , one can find similarities between the suppression of the hydrodynamical instability by the magnetic field and the suppression of the centrifugal instability in taylor - couette flow .    from an astrophysical point of view ,",
    "an important characteristic of the mri is its ability to ensure an efficient outward transport of the angular momentum and to yields accretion , and eventually turbulence . since there are different ways to measure the level of fluctuations in our simulations , we compare three different quantities .",
    "for instance , we computed the quantity @xmath58 , measuring the level of fluctuation of @xmath59 , where @xmath60 denotes time averaging .",
    "the velocity is probed in the equatorial plane at @xmath61 and @xmath43 .",
    "figure [ turb ] shows the evolution of @xmath62 when the elsasser number is increased , for a fixed value of the reynolds number @xmath63 . in figure",
    "[ turb ] , we also show the evolution of the parameter @xmath64 related to the reynolds stress , and the evolution of the excess torque @xmath65 applied on the inner sphere , which quantify the amount of angular momentum transported . for this value of @xmath66 ,",
    "the purely hydrodynamical state consists of a basic spherical couette flow associated with an @xmath34 component , and the total kinetic energy is steady .",
    "as @xmath35 is increased , the flow becomes unstable to several azimuthal wavenumbers , and non - linear interactions rapidly lead to a chaotic evolution of the flow . as can be seen on figure [ turb ]",
    ", this corresponds to a growth of the three quantities @xmath62 , @xmath67 and @xmath65 , evidencing an increase of the level of turbulence and of the amount of angular momentum transported outward .",
    "this transition is illustrated by the two snapshots of figure [ turb ] : for @xmath45 ( left ) , the radial flow taken at @xmath68 is dominated by a smooth @xmath34 perturbation . for @xmath69",
    "however ( right ) , far from the mhd instability onset , the velocity field appears more fluctuating and spatially disorganized .",
    "it is remarkable that the three different quantities used to measure this transition show a good agreement .",
    "this is particularly interesting for comparison between different experiments , where only either torque or velocity measurements are often available .     and @xmath70 .",

    ". these striking similarities between our instability and the magnetorotational instability have important consequences for experimental studies of the mri .",
    "in particular , it points out the difficulties to make a clear distinction between both types of instability from experimental diagnostics . in the next section",
    ", we therefore compare our numerical simulations to experimental results obtained in the maryland experiment , which have been interpreted as non - axisymmetric mri .",
    "in this section , we now keep the outer sphere at rest , and the applied magnetic field is purely axial , aligned with the axis of rotation . while the outer sphere is always taken insulating , two types of boundary conditions have been used for the inner sphere : insulating or conducting ( with the same electrical conductivity as the fluid ) .",
    "this configuration is similar to the one used in the maryland experiment .",
    "this experiment consists of sodium flowing between an inner sphere of radius @xmath73 m and an outer sphere of radius @xmath74 m. the inner sphere is made of high conductivity copper , and an external axial magnetic field is applied coaxially using a pair of electromagnets . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors report that axisymmetric and non - axisymmetric modes are spontaneously excited for sufficiently large @xmath26 when a magnetic field is applied .",
    "most of the parameter space is dominated by an @xmath36 precessing pattern , and the appearance of these instabilities is correlated with a strong increase of the torque applied on the inner sphere .",
    "some of the non - axisymmetric modes are suppressed for large magnetic field .",
    "these results have been interpreted by the authors to be a signature of the magnetorotational instability .",
    "note that since the outer sphere is at rest , the background flow is already very turbulent without applied field , in contrast with the initial stable laminar state generally considered in studies of mri .    as can be seen in figure [ sis0 ]",
    ", the flow without magnetic field is very different from the one obtained in the previous sections , when the outer sphere was rotating : a strong equatorial jet is produced in the midplane , and no stewartson layer is generated .",
    "it is useful to introduce the velocity exponent @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the rotation rate at a cylindrical radius @xmath77 .",
    "the rayleigh criterion for stability , @xmath55 , is thus expected to be violated when the outer sphere is at rest . however , in @xcite , a very weak level of turbulent fluctuations has been reported , together with a velocity exponent around @xmath78 , surprisingly close to a stable keplerian flow . in figure",
    "[ sis0 ] , we show the radial profile of @xmath79 , for different altitudes @xmath32 in a purely hydrodynamical simulation . except near the boundaries ( where the flow is strongly rayleigh unstable ) , stable profiles with @xmath55 can be obtained , depending on the altitude @xmath32 ( for instance , @xmath80 at @xmath81 ) . however , as the measurements are done closer to the midplane , the velocity exponent significantly decreases , and unstable profiles are obtained , with @xmath82 much smaller than @xmath83 .",
    "this is also the case if @xmath32 is too large .",

    "this change of symmetry has also been reported in the maryland experiment .",
    "-the suppression of the @xmath36 mode and the generation of a smaller @xmath34 mode when the inner sphere is switched from conducting to insulating has also been observed in the maryland experiment @xcite .",
    "+ - finally , we computed the evolution of the excess torque applied to the inner sphere in the conducting case . like in the previous section , as the flow becomes unstable to non - axisymmetric perturbations , we observe a strong increase of the total torque applied to the inner sphere ( see the black curve in figure [ sih]-bottom ) .",
    "this evolution has been interpreted as an indication of mri in the maryland experiment .",
    "the fact that our simulations reproduce this feature suggests that shercliff layer and return flow instabilities are also efficient mechanisms to enhance the amount of angular momentum transported outward .",
    "however , a large amount of the augmentation of our torque for this conducting case and the one reported in the maryland experiment could be simply due to the attachment of magnetic field lines to the inner conducting sphere .",
    "indeed , analytical calculations of a rotating conducting sphere with a uniform axial imposed field and surrounded by an infinite medium of stationary sodium , predict an important rise of the torque @xcite . applied to our configuration ,",
    "these calculations lead to a torque of the same order of magnitude than the one reported in the figure [ sih ] . in any case",
    ", this shows that the torque measured in the maryland experiment can not be assumed to be a direct reflection of mri instabilities .",
    "+ an important observation is that both shercliff layer instability and return flow instability are inductionless instabilities , in the sense that they can be generated for arbitrary small magnetic reynolds number if the hydrodynamical reynolds number is large enough .",

    "induction is not a necessary condition for the instability to be generated .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",height=151 ]    the several similarities between our simulations and the results of the maryland experiment emphasize the importance of considering the role of boundaries in mri experiment .",
    "these numerical simulations indeed strongly suggest that the non - axisymmetric modes observed in the experiment are destabilizations of either the shercliff layer ( at large applied field ) or the return flow ( at smaller applied field ) , rather than the mri .",
    "these instabilities appear to be very robust , and extend in a large region of the parameter space .",
    "this is therefore reasonable to expect them to occur in the maryland experiment , which uses a setup similar to our numerical problem .",
    "in addition to these non - axisymmetric modes , an @xmath102 mode equatorially symmetric has also been reported in the maryland experiment .",
    "it is interesting to mention that this axisymmetric mode measured in the experiment has not been obtained in our numerical simulation at @xmath103 .",
    "however , for @xmath104 , axisymmetric modes are generated in the simulations with an axial magnetic field , with or without global rotation .",
    "they seem analogous to magnetostrophic mri modes , a modified version of the mri in spherical geometry , possibly relevant to the earth core @xcite but relying on a magnetostrophic equilibrium not achieved in our simulations .",
    "their analysis is beyond the scope of this paper , and will be studied in a future work .",
    "this @xmath102 mode thus could be of a different nature than the non - axisymmetric ones , and may not be related to the shercliff layer .",
    "in this article , the flow of an electrically conducting fluid in a spherical shell has been studied numerically . when a magnetic field is applied to the system , two different effects are observed .",
    "first , non - axisymmetric hydrodynamical bifurcations from the stewartson layer or from the equatorial jet can be suppressed by a sufficiently strong magnetic field .",
    "but the applied field also has a destabilizing effect , by either disrupting the axisymmetry of the meridional return flow , or through a two - step process : first , an axial or dipolar applied field creates a shercliff layer , and second , this mhd shear layer eventually becomes unstable to non - axisymmetric modes if the magnetic field is not too strong .",
    "we have seen that this shercliff layer instability , or the meridional return flow instability , are dominated by different azimuthal wavenumbers depending on the parameters @xmath37 and the details of the configuration .",
    "these instabilities are very important in the context of laboratory studies of the magnetorotational instability .",
    "indeed , they are relatively robust , and share a lot of characteristics with the non - axisymmetric mri . the marginal stability curve is similar , with a destabilization occurring only in a given range of the value of the applied field .",
    "whereas a finite value of the field is required to trigger the instability , the free energy come from the azimuthal velocity and its associated differential rotation ( at least in the case of the shercliff layer instability ) .",
    "moreover , we have shown that , like the mri , these instabilities yield an mhd turbulent state , and are very efficient to transport the angular momentum outward .",
    "it is however important to insist on the fact that shercliff layer and return flow instabilities are inductionless ( unlike the standard mri ) , and rely on a different destabilization mechanism .",
    "these similarities have important consequences for laboratory studies of the mri .",
    "first , as was suggested in @xcite , our numerical simulations strongly confirm that results of the maryland experiment are related to these boundary driven instabilities rather than mri .",
    "a very good agreement is obtained with experimental observations , including the sequence of non - axisymmetric bifurcations , the geometry of the magnetic field and the increase of the torque on the inner sphere .",
    "this work could also have interesting echos for investigation of the mri in a cylindrical geometry . in this case , the finite geometry imposed by the experimental approach makes it impossible to obtain an ideal couette flow or a quasi - keplerian flow , because of the poloidal recirculation created by the viscous stress at the vertical endcaps .",
    "this problem has been circumvented by replacing the rigid endcaps at the top and the bottom by two rings that are driven independently .",
    "it has been shown that a flow profile in a short taylor - couette cell can be kept stable until @xmath105 if the appropriate configuration of split end caps is used @xcite .",
    "similarly , the use of such split rings in the promise experiment has led to a significant reduction of the ekman pumping and a much clearer identification of the hmri @xcite .",
    "recent three - dimensional numerical simulations @xcite suggest that the jump of angular velocity between inner and outer rings can be reinforced by applying an axial magnetic field , and extended in the @xmath32 direction .",
    "this leads to the creation of a shercliff layer very similar to the one described in this paper , which also undergoes some transition to non - axisymmetric modes .",
    "it is thus possible that similar instabilities could be generated from the shercliff layer or from the poloidal return flow in these cylindrical mri experiments .",
    "this interpretation is reinforced by the fact that the modes observed in the princeton mri experiment appear to be inductionless @xcite .",
    "finally , our numerical simulations show that investigation of the mri in the laboratory is significantly complicated by the presence of no - slip boundaries . in spherical or cylindrical geometry , the applied magnetic field interacts with these boundaries and can trigger mhd instabilities very similar to the mri .",
    "it could make very difficult any distinction between these instabilities and mri in an experiment .",
    "the inductionless nature of shercliff layer instability , in contrast to the required induction for standard mri , may be an important key for the needed distinction between them .",
    "however , as pointed in the introduction , standard mri continuously connects to the helical mri ( hmri ) @xcite , an inductionless version of the mri which can be regarded as an inertial oscillation destabilized by resistive mhd in presence of an helical magnetic field @xcite . in this particular case",
    ", it would be interesting to see how our boundary - driven instabilities can therefore be related to global manifestations of the mri .",
