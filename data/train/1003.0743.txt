    ", the solution gives a momentum ( @xmath18 ) _ field_. in the region where @xmath19 , which is called the quantum potential ( qp),@xcite is not ignorable , the @xmath18 can be wave - like if we give suitable initial conditions .",
    "the lagrangian formalism is based on the semiclassical lagrangian ( in principle , we use , as coordinate variables , @xmath20 and its variants in the h - j formalism , @xmath11 and its variants in the lagrangian formalism ) : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is determined , in principle , to make @xmath23 be true for a solution @xmath24 of ( [ jul1510 - 1 ] ) .",

    "the lagrangian formalism is effective at classical and semiclassical levels ; at the quantum level , our formulation has no lagrangian (  [ jun1609 - 1 ] ) .",
    "we derived ( [ jul1510 - 1 ] ) modifying the classical h - j eq . with the assumption that the action of the diffeomorphism group on the covariant tensor fields of order two is extended .",
    "we note i ) although ( [ jul1510 - 1 ] ) is obtained from the se of qm replacing the wave function @xmath27 in it with @xmath28 and taking the real and imaginary part of the resulting eq .",

    "@xmath31 energy and angular momentum quantizations : in 1-d space , energy quantization appears from the requirement that @xmath6 is continuous at @xmath8 for a solution @xmath33 of ( [ jul1510 - 1 ] ) , which is equivalent , if the @xmath34 is the confining one , for the second order linear differential eq .",
    "corresponding to ( [ jul1510 - 1 ] ) : @xmath35 to have a @xmath36-solution . since this eq .",

    "@xmath31 interference : we consider the double - slits experiment for concreteness . in which , the interference pattern on the screen appears as a result of undulating trajectories .",

    "the effect of the double - slits manifests in the functional form of the @xmath41 . we can not use the e - l eq . for the present purpose because we can not give the exact form of @xmath44 in ( [ jul1510 - 2 ] ) .",
    "we note above reasoning for 1-d energy quantization is essentially the same as that in ref . .",
    "we however repeat it for completeness .",
    "other reasoning would be found nowhere .",
    "our formulation predicts that the density distribution ( dens .",
    "distr . ) of _ massive _ particles in an ensemble deviates from @xmath45 ( by a few percent in the experimental setting of  [ jan2107 - 6 ] ) , which however does not contradict existing data supporting qm because the precision of the data is not enough to exclude our prediction .",
    "for example , the experimental data of the dens .",
    "distr . of electrons",
    "fresnel - diffracted by the electron biprism , @xcite @xcite @xcite which is supposed to support qm s prediction , does not exclude our formulation because the experimental error ( here we mean the difference between the measured and quantum mechanically calculated dens . distr . ) by more than several percent @xcite is larger than the expected difference between qm s and our prediction by a few percent .",
    "thus , we see that our formulation has a chance to be verified by experiments .",
