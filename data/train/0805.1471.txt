    "inflation provides a mechanism of generation of primordial inhomogeneity which is needed for the formation of large scale structures in our present universe . during the qusi - de sitter expansion stage of the inflationary universe ,",
    "short wavelength quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field are generated by particle creations and then they are stretched by the cosmic expansion and their wavelength exceeds the hubble horizon beyond which the physical process proceeds independently . after the wavelength of generated quantum fluctuations become larger than the hubble horizon , the quantum nature of the fluctuation",
    "is expected to be lost and the statistical property of fluctuations is replaced by the classical distribution function .",
    "this is the assumption of the quantum to classical transition of the quantum fluctuation generated during the inflation .",
    "once this assumption is adopted , we can use generated `` classical '' fluctuations as initial perturbations for the large - scale structure formation , which obeys deterministic classical dynamics .",
    "we must explain or justify this assumption of the quantum to classical transition of primordial fluctuation and many investigations have been done on this subject so far@xcite .",
    "a rough outline of the classicalization mechanism proposed in researches@xcite is as follows : in the inflationary universe , particle creations occur due to the accelerated expansion of the universe and the quantum field becomes a highly squeezed state .",
    "for such a highly excited state as a squeezed state , noncommutativity between canonically conjugate variables can be neglected and the operator nature of variables are effectively lost when we evaluate the expectation value of quantum variables .",
    "this means we can regard operators as c - numbers .",
    "furthermore , it can be shown that there appears a sharp peak around a line of the wigner function for the state of quantum fluctuations and this indicates establishment of classical correlation between canonically conjugate variables on the phase space . at this stage",
    ", the wigner function itself can be interpreted as a classical probability distribution function and the quantum fluctuations themselves can be treated as classical stochastic variables .",
    "hence , after sufficient squeezing , we can represent the nature of the quantum fluctuations by the classical stochastic variables with an appropriate probability distribution function of which property is determined by the state of the quantum fluctuations . for the classicality of the quantum system , we also need the mechanism of decoherence and the studies along this line have been done with the assumption of an appropriate coupling between the system and the environment@xcite",
    ".    however , these analysis do not pay attention to an important aspect of quantum mechanics , quantum entanglement , which definitely distinguishes a quantum world from a classical one .",
    "when we calculate a correlation function of observables between spatially separated two regions , we have a possibility that the quantum correlation function can not be reproduced using a local classical probability distribution function if these two regions are entangled@xcite and the classical locality is violated . in other words , we can not regard the quantum fluctuations as the classical stochastic fluctuations as long as the system is entangled .",
    "therefore , it is important to clarify the relation between the entanglement and the appearance of the classical nature to fully understand the mechanism of the quantum to classical transition of primordial fluctuations .    in this paper , we consider the entanglement of quantum field between two spatially separated regions in a de sitter universe and aim to understand the mechanism of the quantum to classical transition of fluctuation from the viewpoint of quantum entanglement .",

    "we use units in which @xmath0 throughout the paper .",
    "in this paper , we focus on a bipartite system composed of two gaussian modes described by canonical variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this is the simplest case deriving entanglement for continuous variable system .",
    "let alice be in possession of mode 1 and let bob be in possession of mode 2 .",
    "a quantum state @xmath3 of the bipartite system is defined to be separable if and only if @xmath4 can be expressed in the form@xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are density operators of the modes of alice and bob , respectively .",
    "if the state of the system can not be expressed in this form , the quantum state of the system is called entangled . when the state is entangled , the observables associated to the party a and b are correlated and their correlations can not be reproduced with purely classical means .",
    "this leads to the phenomena peculiar to the quantum mechanics such as the epr correlation@xcite and the violation of bell s inequality@xcite .    for a bipartite gaussian two mode system , we have necessary and sufficient conditions for separability@xcite and we can judge whether the system is entangled or not using these criteria . in this paper , we adopt a criterion proposed by simon@xcite which uses the partial transpose operation for a bipartite system .",

    "the density matrix must be non - negative and the corresponding covariance matrix must satisfy the inequality@xcite @xmath12 which is the generalization of the uncertainty relation between two canonically conjugate variables .",
    "the separability of the bipartite gaussian state is expressed in terms of the partial transpose operation defined by @xmath13 this operation reverses the sign of bob s momentum . with this operation ,",
    "the covariance matrix transforms as @xmath14 the necessary and sufficient condition of the separability is given by the inequality @xmath15 which represents the physical condition for the partially transposed state .",
    "for an entangled state , this inequality is violated and the partially transposed state becomes unphysical . to measure the degrees of entanglement , we introduce the logarithmic negativity via symplectic eigenvalues of the covariance matrix",

    ", we defined a bipartite system as the subsystem of the entire universe and we discard the unobserved dynamical degrees of freedom outside of the observed region .",

    "we expect that the condition @xmath127 corresponds to the condition @xmath128 which is stronger than the separability .",
    "anyways , we must reconsider the meaning of the probability in the stochastic approach from the view point of entanglement .",
    "we will report on this topic in a separate publication .    in this paper",
    ", we assumed the bunch - davis vacuum state .",
    "previous analysis by j. lesgourgues _ _ et al.__@xcite considered the nonvacuum initial states that are non - gaussian and concluded that the non - gaussian nature of the state does not affect the transition to the classical behavior . however , from the viewpoint of the entanglement , the condition of the separability for non - gaussian states is unknown and the determination of a classicality condition for such states is an unsolved problem .",
    "further , we considered the quantum to classical transition based on the bipartite entanglement only .",
    "this is because the criterion on the separability for the general @xmath39-partite system is unknown@xcite .",
