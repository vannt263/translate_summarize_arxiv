    "the low - energy @xmath6 scattering and transition to coupled channels is one of the cases of successful application of chiral dynamics in the baryon sector .",
    "the studies of @xcite and @xcite showed that one could obtain an excellent description of the low - energy data starting from chiral lagrangians and using the multichannel lippman - schwinger equation to account for multiple scattering and unitarity in coupled channels . by including all open channels above threshold and fitting a few chiral parameters of the second - order lagrangian one could obtain a good agreement with the data at low energies .",
    "this line of work was continued in @xcite , where all coupled channels were included that could be arranged from the octet of pseudoscalar goldstone bosons and the baryon ground state octet .",
    "in ref.@xcite it was demonstrated that using the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) with coupled channels and using the lowest - order chiral lagrangians , together with one cut off to regularize the intermediate meson - baryon loops , a good description of all low - energy data was obtained .",
    "one of the novel features with respect to other approaches using the bse is that the lowest - order meson - baryon amplitudes , playing the role of a potential , could be factorized on shell in the bse , and thus the set of coupled - channels integral equations became a simple set of algebraic equations , thus technically simplifying the problem .",
    "the justification of this procedure is seen in a more general way in the treatment of meson - meson interactions using chiral lagrangians and the n / d method in @xcite .",
    "one uses dispersion relations and shows that neglecting the effects of the left - hand singularity ( also shown to be small there ) one needs only the on - shell scattering matrix from the lowest - order lagrangian , and the eventual effects of higher - order lagrangians are accounted for in terms of subtractions in the dispersion integrals .",
    "the n / d method has also been recently applied to study pion - nucleon dynamics in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the work of ref.@xcite was reanalyzed recently @xcite from the point of view of the n / d method and dispersion relations , leading formally to the same algebraic equations found in @xcite .",
    "there are also technical novelties in the regularization of the loop function , which is done using dimensional regularization in ref.@xcite , while it was regularized with a cut off in ref.@xcite .",
    "one of the common findings shared by all the theoretical approaches is the dynamical generation of the @xmath7 resonance which appears with the right width , and at the correct position , with the choice of a cut off of natural size .",
    "this natural generation from the interaction of the meson - baryon system with the lowest - order lagrangian allows us to identify that state as a quasibound meson - baryon state .",
    "this would explain why ordinary quark models have had so many problems explaining this resonance @xcite .    in ordinary quark models",
    "the @xmath7 resonance would mostly be a su(3 ) singlet of @xmath8 and there would be an associated octet of s - wave excited @xmath8 baryons that would include the n*(1535 ) , the @xmath2 , the @xmath3 and a @xmath9 state . in the chiral approach",
    "one would also expect the appearance of such a nonet of resonances .",
    "in fact , it appears naturally in the approach of ref.@xcite , with a degenerate octet , when setting all the masses of the octet of stable baryons equal on one side and the masses of the octet of pseudoscalar mesons equal on the other side . yet , to obtain this result it is essential that the coupled channels do not omit any of the channels that can be constructed from the octet of pseudoscalar mesons and the octet of stable baryons .",
    "the lowest - order lagrangian involving the octet of pseudoscalar mesons and the @xmath10 baryons is given in @xcite .",
    "at lowest order in momentum , that we will keep in our study , the interaction lagrangian reads @xmath11 > \\ , \\label{eq : lowest}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the su(3 ) matrices for the mesons and baryons , respectively and the symbol @xmath14 stands for the trace of the resulting su(3 ) matrix .",
    "the lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lowest ] ) leads to a common structure of the type @xmath15 for the different channels , where @xmath16 are the dirac spinors and @xmath17 the momenta of the incoming and outgoing mesons .",
    "we take the @xmath18 state and all those that couple to it within the chiral scheme , namely @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "hence we have a problem with ten coupled channels .    the lowest - order amplitudes for these channels are easily evaluated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : lowest ] ) and are given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the initial , final momenta of the baryons ( mesons ) . for low energies one can write this amplitude as @xmath30 and the matrix @xmath31 , which is symmetric ,",
    "is given in @xcite .",
    "note that the use of physical masses in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ampl2 ] ) is introducing effectively some contributions of higher orders in the chiral counting . in the standard chiral approach",
    "one would be using the average mass of the octets in the chiral limit and higher order lagrangians involving su(3 ) breaking terms would generate the mass differences . by introducing the physical masses",
    "one guarantees that the phase space for the reactions , thresholds and unitarity in coupled channels are respected from the beginning .",
    "we also use in our approach an average value for the pseudoscalar meson decay constant , @xmath32 , as done in @xcite .",
    "we shall construct the amplitudes using the isospin formalism for which we must use average masses for the @xmath33 @xmath34 , @xmath35 @xmath36 ) , @xmath37 @xmath38 , @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) , @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) and @xmath43 @xmath44 states .",
    "the isospin states are given in @xcite .",
    "we have four @xmath45 channels , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , while there are five @xmath49 channels , @xmath50 and @xmath48 .",
    "the transition matrix elements in isospin formalism read like eq .",
    "( [ eq : ampl2 ] ) substituting the @xmath51 coefficients by @xmath52 for @xmath53 and by @xmath54 for @xmath55 , with the @xmath52 and @xmath54 coefficients given in @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "using the n / d method of @xcite for this particular case it was proved that the scattering amplitude could be written by means of the algebraic matrix equation @xmath56^{-1}\\ , v \\label{eq : bs1}\\ ] ] with @xmath57 the matrix of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ampl2 ] ) evaluated on shell , or equivalently @xmath58 with @xmath59 a diagonal matrix given by @xmath60 which depends on @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "one can see that eq .",
    "( [ eq : bs2 ] ) is just the bethe salpeter equation but with the @xmath57 matrix factorized on shell , which allows one to extract the scattering matrix @xmath63 trivially , as seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bs1 ] ) .    the analytical expression for @xmath64 can be obtained from @xcite using a cut off and from @xcite using dimensional regularization , @xmath65 \\right\\ } \\ ,",
    "\\label{eq : gpropdr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which has been rewritten in a convenient way to show how the imaginary part of @xmath64 is generated and how one can go to the unphysical riemann sheets in order to identify the poles .",
    "the dimensional regularization scheme is preferable if one goes to higher energies where the on - shell momentum of the intermediate states is not reasonably smaller than the cut off .",
    "the coupled set of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bs1 ] ) were solved in @xcite using a cut off momentum of 630 mev in all channels .",
    "changes in the cut off can be accommodated in terms of changes in @xmath66 , the regularization scale in the dimensional regularization formula for @xmath64 , or in the subtraction constant @xmath67 . in order to obtain the same results as in @xcite at low energies , we set @xmath66 equal to the cut off momentum of 630 mev ( in all channels ) and then find the values of the subtraction constants @xmath67 such as to have @xmath64 with the same value with the dimensional regularization formula ( eq .  ( [ eq : gpropdr ] ) ) and the cut off formula ( eq .  ( [ eq : gprop ] ) ) at the @xmath68 threshold .",
    "this determines the values @xmath69 in this way we guarantee that we obtain the same results at low energies as in @xcite and we find indeed that this is the case when we repeat the calculation with the new @xmath64 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gpropdr ] ) .",
    "then we extend the results at higher energies , looking for the eventual appearance of new resonances .",
    "the solid lines of figs .",
    "[ fig : kn0 ] and [ fig : pis ] show the results for the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath53 amplitudes for @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "both channels clearly display the signal from the @xmath2 resonance , although large background contributions are present in the amplitudes as well .",
    "the normalization of the amplitudes shown in figs . [ fig : kn0 ] and [ fig : pis ] is different from the one of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bs1 ] ) .",
    "we shall call @xmath72 the plotted amplitudes and the relationship to our former amplitudes is given by @xmath73 the normalization of @xmath72 is particularly suited to analyze the data in terms of the speed plot @xcite .",
    "one has the amplitude written as @xmath74 with @xmath75 , where @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 are , respectively , the total width and the partial decay widths of the resonance into the @xmath79 channels .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : speed ] we show the obtained speed @xmath81 for different transitions , @xmath82 ( solid line ) , @xmath83 ( dotted line ) and @xmath84 ( dashed line ) . as is evident from the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : speed ] , the background induced by the already opened meson - baryon channels in the region of interest is quite smooth , since an approximate breit - wigner shape is obtained from the derivative of the amplitudes . on the other hand ,",
    "the resonance region we study does indeed lie above the two - pion threshold for both @xmath85 and @xmath41 production .",
    "such threshold openings could show up in some form as a non - smooth background contribution .",
    "however , there is no empirical evidence that any of the s - channel hyperon resonances under investigation here couple strongly to the two - pion channel , hence , we do not expect the breit - wigner shape of fig .  [",
    "fig : speed ] to be modified by the inclusion of extra inelastic channels .",
    "the study of the speed plots shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : speed ] allows us to obtain the energy @xmath86 mev , the total width @xmath87 mev , and the branching ratios , @xmath88% , @xmath89% , and @xmath90% .",
    "experimentally , one has @xmath91 mev , @xmath92 mev , @xmath93% , @xmath94% , and @xmath95% @xcite .",
    "we seem to overestimate the @xmath4 and @xmath47 branching ratios and underestimate the @xmath96 one .      comparison of our results with the experimental data in figs .",
    "[ fig : kn0 ] and [ fig : pis ] shows qualitative but not quantitative agreement .",
    "this is not surprising since no parameters have been fitted to these data , but rather we have chosen the low - energy parametrization of our theory which contained only one free parameter , the cut off to regularize the loops .",
    "we now exploit the freedom that the theory has by changing the parameters @xmath98 .",
    "however , this must be accomplished in a way that does not ruin the very good agreement with the low - energy data , found in ref.@xcite .",
    "we find that the results at low energies are very insensitive to changes in the @xmath99 parameter , but they are sensitive to changes in @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 . on the other hand ,",
    "the position of the @xmath2 resonance is quite sensitive to changes in the @xmath103 parameter and only moderately sensitive to @xmath104 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "this allows us to fine tune the parameter @xmath99 ( without changing the other @xmath105 parameters ) in order to better reproduce the position of the resonance found by experiment while maintaining the agreement found at low energies .",
    "[ fig : kn0 ] and [ fig : pis ] also display the results using @xmath106 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "we see that a change of 6% in this parameter moves the position of the resonance by @xmath107 mev and it agrees better with experiment .",
    "the values of the resonance mass , width and branching ratios obtained now are @xmath108 mev , the total width @xmath87 mev , and the branching ratios @xmath109% , @xmath110% , and @xmath111% .",
    "comparison of the theoretical results for @xmath112 with the data shows agreement for the imaginary part within errors , while our prediction for the real part below the resonance differs from the data by what appears to be a large constant background term .",
    "this discrepancy needs to be looked at with some perspective .",
    "the contribution of the real part to the cross section from the experimental data is negligible and is only 10 percent in the theoretical case . on the other hand ,",
    "our results around @xmath113 mev , the @xmath4 threshold , are in good agreement with the data for the @xmath114 and @xmath115 scattering lengths , which would suggest some discrepancy at low energies between the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kn0 ] @xcite and those of @xcite and @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pis ] we display the @xmath53 @xmath116 amplitude .",
    "the theoretical amplitude shows the resonance features with the same pattern as the experiment , both for the real as for the imaginary parts .",
    "yet there is disagreement with the data in the imaginary part , again with an apparent background missing for the theoretical prediction .",
    "once again , the discrepancy looks puzzling since up to @xmath117 mev , and even beyond where the s - wave is still dominant , the agreement of the present model with the experimental cross sections for @xmath118 is very good @xcite .",
    "we should note that the errors plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : kn0 ] and [ fig : pis ] correspond to the reasonable guesses of ref .",
    "@xcite , but there are actual deviations between the data of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . due to the large background in the experimental analysis ,",
    "the interference effects with the resonance are more apparent , leading to a larger branching ratio to the @xmath119 channel than the theory predicts .",
    "we can also compare the results of the model with the recent data on the @xmath120 reaction @xcite , which improve on the older experiments @xcite .",
    "the shape of the results and the position of the peak that we obtain agree well with the data for a parameter @xmath106 but we get a strength at the peak of @xmath121 mb , about a factor of two larger than the latest experimental value of @xmath122 mb . this reflects the fact that our predicted @xmath4 branching ratio overestimates the experimental value .",
    "we have studied the reactions @xmath123 and @xmath124 , which take place at energies beyond @xmath125 gev , hence above the position of the @xmath2 resonance . around a laboratory @xmath126 momentum of @xmath127 gev / c , and using @xmath106 , our model predicts a cross section of @xmath128 mb for the reaction @xmath123 , which compares favourably with the experimental value of @xmath129 mb @xcite . for the reaction @xmath130",
    "we find a cross section of @xmath131 mb at @xmath127 gev / c , which overestimates by almost a factor of three the experimental value of @xmath132 mb @xcite .",
    "in the @xmath55 channel we find only rough agreement with the data in the @xmath70 and @xmath116 amplitudes , but , just like the data , we find no evidence of a resonance signal that would allow us to identify the @xmath3 resonance . clearly , the absence of a signal even in some of the experimental amplitudes has lead to classifying the @xmath3 as only a 2-star resonance .",
    "however , the absence of such a resonance would be somewhat surprising since we expect to get an octet of meson - baryon resonances and so far only a singlet and the @xmath53 part of the octet ( eventually mixed between themselves ) have appeared . since we do not see this state in the amplitudes at real energies we look for a pole in the complex plane .",
    "we go directly to the second riemann sheet , which we take in our case as the one where the momenta of the channels which are open at energy @xmath133 , with @xmath134 , are taken negative in @xmath64 .    near the poles",
    "the amplitudes that we are analyzing behave as @xmath135 thus , the residues of the @xmath136 matrix give the product of the coupling of the resonance to the @xmath137 channels , while the residues of the @xmath138 give one half of the product of the two partial decay widths .",
    "the first one of equations ( [ eq : tres2 ] ) determines the coupling of the resonance to different final states , which are well defined even if these states are closed in the decay of the resonance .",
    "the search of the poles leads us , using @xmath139 , to the values @xmath140 mev , @xmath141 mev , @xmath142% , @xmath143% , and @xmath144% , in remarkable agreement with the values obtained from the speed plot . for @xmath106",
    ", we obtain @xmath145 mev , @xmath87 mev , @xmath146% , @xmath147% , and @xmath148% .",
    "the couplings obtained for the @xmath2 resonance , using @xmath139 , are @xmath149 and , using @xmath106 , we obtain @xmath150 it is also interesting to display the results of the complex plane search for the @xmath7 resonance .",
    "we find @xmath151 @xmath152 with only the @xmath119 channel open for the decay .",
    "we find that the agreement with the pdg @xcite is quite good for the case of the @xmath7 .",
    "for the case of the @xmath2 we find a good agreement with the total width , but the partial decay widths to the @xmath155 and @xmath24 channels is somewhat overpredicted while the partial decay width to the @xmath96 channel that we obtain is a bit too small . for the case of the @xmath3 resonance",
    "we find a very large width which may be the reason why this state does not provide a clearer signal in the scattering amplitudes .",
    "the analysis of the couplings is very interesting . in the case of the @xmath7 state the coupling to the @xmath4 channel",
    "is found to be very large , while the coupling to the other channels is very small .",
    "this would allow us to identify this resonance as a quasibound @xmath4 state in the present approach .",
    "similarly , we find that the @xmath2 resonance has a large coupling to the @xmath5 channel and unusually small couplings to the other final states .",
    "this is responsible for the small width of the resonance in spite of the large phase space open for decay into the different channels .",
    "the large coupling to the @xmath5 channel allows identifying this state as a @xmath5 quasibound state in the present approach .",
    "by contrast , the @xmath3 resonance has couplings of normal size to all channels , and , given the large phase space available , it has a sizable decay width into any of the channels and hence a considerably larger total width .    in summary",
    ", we have demonstrated that the chiral approach to the @xmath4 and the other coupled channels , which proved so successful at low energies , extrapolates smoothly to higher energies and provides the basic features of the scattering amplitudes , generating the resonances which would complete the states of the nonet of the @xmath8 excited states .",
    "the qualitative description of the data without adjusting any parameters is telling us that the basic information on the dynamics of these processes is contained in the chiral lagrangians .",
    "there is still some freedom left with the chiral symmetry breaking terms . in our formulation",
    "they would go into the @xmath67 subtraction constants , and the use of different decay constants for each meson , by means of which one could obtain a better description of the data .",
    "however , before proceeding in this direction , and eventually introduce further chiral symmetry breaking terms , it would be important to sort out the apparent discrepancies between different sets of data .",
    "the analysis of the poles and the couplings of the resonances to the different channels lead us to identify the strong coupling of the @xmath7 resonance to the @xmath4 state and the large coupling of the @xmath2 resonance to the @xmath5 state , allowing us to classify these resonances as quasibound states of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
