    "the dielectric properties of metals , as well as those of semiconductors with high electron concentration , are due to collective effects arising from the coulomb interaction between charges . in simple bulk metals the conduction electrons can be considered as a free - electron plasma . frequency dependence of some of optical properties can be well described at a quantitative level by the drude - lorentz dielectric function  @xcite .",
    "optical properties of the electron gas in bulk metals , in proximity semi - infinitive surfaces , in thin films , and in metallic particles can be characterized by the eigenfrequencies of the system depending on free electron density and the geometry of the system .",
    "if we talk of  plasmons  or  plasma waves  ,",
    "we mean eigenmodes of the self - consistent maxwell equations for the system in the absence of an external electromagnetic field ( or in a direction orthogonal to the field ) ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .  surface plasmons  , are used as a name for electromagnetic eigenmodes which are maximal near the surface .",
    "the time dependence of eigenmodes of a free - electron system is characterized by corresponding eigenfrequencies with the real part defining the frequency of oscillation , and the imaginary part defining the radiative damping .",
    "usually the eigenmode problem of a metallic sphere is studied in the limit of very small size parameter ( retardation effect omitted ) , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the radiative damping of plasmon oscillation is not included .",
    "the dipole mode eigenfrequency is then expected to be equal to @xmath0 being responsible for the  giant dipole resonance ",
    "resulting from the mie scattering theory ( @xcite , and also e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath1 is the modified plasma frequency , which can include or not the cluster core polarizability and ( or ) the spill - out effect of electron density at particle border , depending on the model approximations in effect .    in @xcite ,",
    "@xcite we have reconsidered the eigenvalue problem of a free - electron metal sphere as a function of sphere radius without any assumption concerning the particle size and including higher eigenmodes than the dipole ones .",
    "we have studied the dipole ( @xmath2 ) and the higher polarity plasmon eigenfrequencies @xmath3 as well as the plasmon radiative decay rates @xmath4 as a function of the particle radius @xmath5 with no assumption concerning the lower limit of the particle size in numerical modelling ( retardation effects included ) for @xmath6 . in @xcite",
    "we have also studied the plasmon manifestation in scattering and absorbing properties of the sphere of arbitrarily large size ( retardation included ) within full scattering mie theory .    in the present paper ,",

    "we look for solutions fulfilling maxwell s equations in the form of transversal waves ( @xmath29 @xmath30 ) in two homogeneous regions inside and outside the sphere so the wave equation : @xmath31 for harmonic fields @xmath32 reduces to the helmholtz equation :    @xmath33    where : @xmath34 inside the sphere , @xmath35 in the sphere surroundings , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
