    "certain operations permitted in classical physics can not be done perfectly in quantum mechanics .",
    "this is best exemplified by the celebrated no - cloning theorem @xcite which forbids to create two perfect copies of an unknown quantum state .",
    "the no - cloning theorem is closely related to another no - go theorem stating that one can not gain some information on an unknown quantum state without disturbing it .",
    "namely , if this would be possible one would be able to prepare two approximate replicas of this state which would be better than the best ones allowed by quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "therefore , in quantum mechanics any operation on an unknown quantum state giving some information on the state inevitably disturbs the state and in addition , the more information it extracts the larger is the disturbance .",
    "this fundamental property of quantum operations is reflected in the plane of values of quantities quantifying the information gain and the state disturbance by a certain optimal trade - off curve that can not be overcome by any quantum operation . among all quantum operations",
    "particularly interesting are those which lie on this curve since they to the best possible extent as quantum mechanics allows approximate ideal disturbance - free measurement device .",
    "these operations , conventionally denoted as minimal disturbance measurements ( mdms ) , in general depend on the set of input states , their a priori distribution and also on the quantities quantifying the information gain and the state disturbance @xcite .",
    "the most successful approach to the finding of the optimal trade - offs and corresponding mdms proved to be that based on the quantification of the information gain by the mean estimation fidelity @xmath2 and the state disturbance by the mean output fidelity @xmath3 @xcite . using this approach it was possible to derive analytically the optimal trade - offs between @xmath2 and @xmath3 and to find the mdms for a single copy of a completely unknown pure state of a @xmath1-level system @xcite , a completely unknown pure state of a @xmath1-level system produced by @xmath1 independent phase shifts of some reference state @xcite and a completely unknown maximally entangled state of two @xmath1-level systems @xcite . besides , the first two above mentioned mdms were also demonstrated experimentally for @xmath4 ( qubit ) @xcite .",
    "the studies on mdm were not restricted to finite - dimensional quantum systems and also mdm for a completely unknown coherent state was found and realized experimentally in @xcite .",
    "multi - copy mdms were introduced by banaszek and devetak who considered partial measurement on @xmath0 identical copies of a pure qubit state .",
    "they assumed mdms which output @xmath0 disturbed quantum copies of the state and a classical estimate and they _ numerically _ found the optimal fidelity trade - off for this scenario @xcite .",
    "the mdms are not only of fundamental importance but they can be also applied to increase transmission fidelity of certain lossy and noisy channels @xcite .    in this paper we further investigate the minimum disturbance measurement on several copies of the state .",
    "in contrast to ref . @xcite we assume operations which output only a _ single _ quantum copy of the input state .",
    "we derive _ analytically _ the optimal trade - off between the mean estimation fidelity @xmath2 and the mean output fidelity @xmath3 for an ensemble of @xmath0 identical pure qubits which is given by the formula @xmath5 moreover , we also conjecture that the optimal fidelity trade - off for an ensemble of @xmath0 identical pure states of a @xmath1-level system has the form @xmath6 the paper is organized as follows . the general formalism allowing to determine the mdm",
