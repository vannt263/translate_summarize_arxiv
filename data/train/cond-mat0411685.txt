    "hydrogen is well known to diffuse and dissolve well in pd , which has motivated researchers from many different disciplines to investigate pd - h complex due to its possible application as hydrogen carrier.@xcite the adsorption , dissociation and diffusion of hydrogen on single crystalline pd has been studied as a model system to understand atomistic process of hydrogen incorporation and catalytic behavior of pd . for pd(001 ) , numerous experimental works have been performed by employing low energy electron diffraction ( leed ) @xcite , he ion scattering@xcite , work function measurement@xcite , thermal desorption spectroscopy ( tds)@xcite , nuclear reaction analysis ( nra)@xcite , electron energy loss spectroscopy ( eels)@xcite . moreover , _",
    "ab initio _ calculations have been made to study electronic and atomic structures , and chemical properties of pd(001 ) upon hydrogen adsorption.@xcite thereupon , found are many physical and chemical properties of pd(001 ) such as dissociation mechanism of @xmath1 , adsorption sites and adsorption energies of hydrogen , dependence of work function on the coverage of hydrogen , desorption and dissolution kinetics of hydrogen on pd(001 ) .",
    "the atomic structure of clean and hydrogen - adsorbed pd(001 ) is , however , not established yet .",
    "behm @xmath2@xcite and jona @xmath3@xcite found from their leed i / v analysis that the interlayer spacing of the first two layers from the surface ( @xmath0 ) expanded by 2.5 % , 3.0 % , respectively , with respect to the coresponding bulk spacing , @xmath4 .",
    "most unreconstructed metal ( 001 ) surface , however , show contraction of @xmath0 , due to increased bond strength between the two layers resulting from the redistribution of electrons from surface atoms to the first interlayer space.@xcite in this regards , the expansion of @xmath0 of pd(001 ) is an unexpected observation .    as the origin for such an expansion of @xmath0 , jona @xmath2@xcite pointed out two possibilities ; magnetization of the surface and hydrogen contamination of pd(001 ) .",
    "magnetization of pd thin ( @xmath5 5ml ) films grown on ag(001)@xcite and au(001)@xcite was investigated by moke , but null magnetization is found .",
    "both self - consistent tight binding calculation@xcite and _ ab initio _",
    "calculation by full potential liniearized augmented plane wave method ( flapw ) predicted delicate dependence of magnetization of pd on the thickness of slab to model pd(001 ) .",
    "( _ note : at the moment we are waiting for the result of prof .",
    "hong on the effect of magnetization on surface relaxation pf pd(001 ) .",
    "he suggested very small , if any , relaxation due to the tiny magnetization of pd .",
    "_ ) on the other hand , for hydrogen covered pd(001 ) , expansion of @xmath0 is predicted.@xcite however , no direct experimental investigation has been made yet to examine the correlation between hydrogen coverage and the atomic structure of pd(001 ) .",
    "such study should be critical to identify the origin of the observed expansion of @xmath0 .",
    "the present work is aimed to experimentally clarify the effect of hydrogen coverage on the atomic structure of pd(001 ) .",
    "we carefully prepare pd(001 ) with various hydrogen coverages , and investigate their atomic structure by leed i / v analysis . from that study , we find that there is little expansion of @xmath0 for clean pd(001 ) , while the @xmath0 monotonically expands with increasing hydrogen coverage .",
    "we also find that the remnant hydrogen in our experimental chamber , although its base pressure is very low , low @xmath6 mbar , can swiftly contaminate pd(001 ) and result in the notable expansion of @xmath0 .",
    "combining all the abovementioned observation , we conclude that expansion of @xmath0 of clean pd(001 ) previously reported by other experimental groups@xcite , originates from hydrogen contamination of pd(001 ) .",
    "all the experiments were performed in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber with its base pressure low @xmath6 mbar .",
    "the chamber was equipped with rear - view leed optics and cylindrical mirror analyzer for auger electron spectroscopy ( aes ) .",
    "pd(001 ) sample was of `` top - hat '' shape with its diameter , 8 mm , and thickness , 1 mm .",
    "we cleaned the sample by iterating sputtering with 2 kev ar@xmath7 and annealing at 950 k for 20 minutes . to remove remnant carbon , we oxidized it by annealing the sample at 650k in an oxygen ambient pressure of @xmath8 mbar , and desorbed it at 950 k , until there was observed no aes peak of carbon .",
    "once the contaminants were removed of the sample , we prepared the sample by sputtering and annealing only for once . from now on , we call this routine sample preparation procedure , @xmath9 procedure .    for the @xmath9 procedure , the time required to complete acquisition of i / v spectra was around 2 hours from the start of annealing . during that period",
    ", it seemed highly possible that the surface was contaminated by residual hydrogen .",
    "thus , we prepared clean sample in two different ways to ensure cleanliness of pd(001 ) .",
    "the first way was to minimize the time till i / v acquisition ; after following the @xmath9 procedure , we flashed the sample up to 950 k to detach any residual hydrogen and cooled the sample to 150 k within 30 minutes by liquid nitrogen .",
    "( desorption temperatures of surface and subsurface hydrogen , @xmath10 , were known to be lower than 340 k. @xcite ) following this @xmath11 cleaning process , we could finish the i / v acquisition within 1 hour in the better vacuum condition .",
    "the second method was based on the fact that the desorption temperature of hydrogen was around 340 k ; we took i / v with the sample at temperatures higher than the desorption temperature .",
    "hydrogen covered pd(001 ) was also investigated as follows ; after flashing the sample at 950 k , we cooled it down to 150 k for hydrogen dose , because the hydrogen was known to dissolve into bulk pd near room temperature .",
    "@xcite we dosed 6@xmath1212 langmr ( l ) of hydrogen in an ambient hydrogen pressure , @xmath8 mbar .",
    "since there was little difference in leed i / v for dosing more than 6 l of hydrogen , we concluded that 6 l of hydrogen was enough to saturate pd(001 ) .",
    "hydrogen saturated pd(001 ) showed @xmath13 leed pattern with its background intensity about the same as for clean pd(001 ) on visual inspection .",
    "leed i / v spectra were obtained by a fully automated video - leed system comprised of a charge coupled device ( ccd ) camera and a program for image processing .",
    "the i / v spectra were always taken with the sample normal to the electron beam .",
    "leed i / v analysis was made by satleed program.@xcite scattering phase shifts were obtained from potentials of moruzi @xmath14@xcite for its angular momentum , @xmath15 from 0 to 10 .",
    "thermal vibration effect was taken into account by debye - waller factor with debye temperatures of h and pd , 1800 k and 260 k , respectively .",
    "we also varied the debye temperatures as fitting parameters , however , the best - fit atomic structure was not sensitive to them .",
    "the quality of i / v fit was judged by the reliability factor of pendry , @xmath16 , and error limit was set by its variance.@xcite fitting was made for various model structures , and the best - fit structure was concluded after iterating the fitting till the difference between the input structural parameters and those of the resulting best - fit structure were within 0.001  .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      is presented for increasing hydrogen coverage .",
    "the x - axis just indicates the direction of increasing hydrogen coverage , but is not in proportion .",
    "@xmath17 signifies clean pd(001 ) prepared by @xmath11 cleaning ( table i ) .",
    "_ 150 - 310 k _ refers to mean @xmath18 of 1 ml of hydrogen - covered surfaces from 150 k to 310 k. ( table iii ) _ standard cleaning _ indicates pd(001 ) cleaned via @xmath9 procedure , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 do pd(001 ) dosed with the respective amount of hydrogen at room temperature .",
    "@xmath21 refers to jona et .",
    "al.s experiment.@xcite , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in table iv , given are the best - fit structures of pd(001 ) 1 ) prepared via @xmath9 cleaning and 2 ) dosed respectively by 6 and 12",
    "l of hydrogen at room temperature .",
    "when 6 l of hydrogen is dosed , @xmath0 expands by 2.4 % , while it does by 3.0 % with increased dosage of 12 l. in regards to the fact that @xmath0 expands by 4.7 % for hydrogen saturated surface at 150 k , we find monotonic increase of @xmath22 with increasing amount of hydrogen coverage.(fig .",
    "5 ) from the above account , the reason why the amount of expansion of @xmath0 varies experiment by experiment is evidently the different degree of hydrogen contamination due to different sample cleaning procedure and/or experimental environment . in short ,",
    "the previous experimetal results of expanded @xmath0 of clean pd(001 ) is attributed to the contamination by residual hydrogen .",
    "we prepare clean pd(001 ) in two different ways , @xmath11 cleaning and hydrogen desorption , and consistently find by leed i//v analysis that the atomic structure of clean pd(001 ) is similar to bulk - terminated pd(001 ) .",
    "( fig.1 and 4 ) on the other hand , hydrogen covered surface shows monotonic increase of @xmath0 with increasing hydrogen coverage .",
    "5 ) the present , systematic study on the effect of hydrogen on the atomic structure of pd(001 ) firmly conclude that the previously reported expansion of interlayer spacing of pd(001 ) originates from hydrogen contamination of the sample ."
