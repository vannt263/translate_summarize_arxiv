    "the adsorption of carbon monoxide has intrigued researchers in surface science for the last decades .",
    "this has obvious reasons .",
    "carbon monoxide is a simple diatomic molecule , but despite its simplicity it shows a rich phase diagram on metal surfaces.@xcite the co dissociation reaction involves a very simple reaction mechanism , but nevertheless the reaction barriers can be greatly varied by alloying or roughening the surface.@xcite it is fair to say that , together with hydrogen adsorption and dissociation , co has become a classical benchmark for experimental and theoretical surface science techniques .",
    "this interest is also strongly driven by the importance of co for many technologically relevant reactions.@xcite    in this light , it is unsatisfactory that state of the art density functional calculations fail to describe several aspects of the adsorption of co on metal surfaces accurately .",
    "this concerns both the predicted adsorption site as well as the absolute magnitude of the adsorption energy . for the cu , rh and pt ( 111 ) surface ,",
    "the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) in the pbe version predicts that co adsorbs at a high coordination site ( typically the hollow site ) , whereas experiments unequivocally show that atop adsorption is preferred . for ag and",
    "au a degenerate site preference is predicted , which does not agree with experiments either.@xcite equally compelling is that adsorption energies are significantly overestimated using the pbe functional.@xcite these discrepancies have first been noticed in a now classical paper by feibelmann _",
    "et al . _ and",
    "the name _ co adsorption puzzle _ has been coined.@xcite since then there has been emerging evidence that the present local and semi - local functionals are not capable to describe the subtle balance between donation of charge to the substrate and back donation to the molecule correctly for many adsorption problems .",
    "however , it is still an open question whether this is a universal shortcoming of such functionals , or whether the functionals can be amended to improve the description of surface related properties without drastically worsening other important properties.@xcite    the common model to describe co adsorption is the blyholder model,@xcite which invokes interactions of the two co frontier orbitals , the @xmath2 homo ( highest occupied molecular orbital ) and the @xmath3 lumo ( lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ) , with the metal states . due to the interaction with the metal states bonding @xmath2-metal orbitals and anti - bonding @xmath2-metal orbitals",
    "develop , and the latter are partly shifted above the fermi - level of the metal , causing a net bonding interaction ( donation ) .",
    "likewise , bonding @xmath3-metal hybrid states become populated ( back - donation ) .",
    "simple symmetry reasons tell that the highly directional @xmath2-metal interaction is particularly strong for atop adsorption , whereas the @xmath3 interaction is dominating for hollow site adsorption.@xcite    here we apply a set of now well established semi - local as well as hybrid functionals to the co adsorption problem .",
    "our focus is on the systematic variation across the periodic table , and on how hybrid functionals compare to the more traditional semi - local functionals .",
    "we show that none of the available functionals is capable to yield an equally satisfactory description of the _ metal and the co adsorption_.",
    "the first principles density functional theory calculations and the hybrid functional calculations have been performed using the vasp code , paw@xcite potentials in the implementation of kresse and joubert@xcite and a cutoff energy of 400 ev .",
    "the surfaces are modelled by a periodic four layer metal slab with @xmath4 symmetry , and the co molecule is adsorbed on one side of the slab .",
    "we focus only on the atop and hollow fcc adsorption sites , since the difference in calculated adsorption energies between the hcp and fcc hollow adsorption site is generally small , on the order of 0.05 ev ; see , e.g. , refs .  .",
    "the brillouin zone integration is performed on symmetry reduced @xmath5-centered 6@xmath66@xmath61 grids ( i.e. roughly @xmath7 in the primitive cell ) .",
    "since we want to concentrate on trends , all metals are considered in the fcc structure , although os and ru crystallize in the hcp lattice structure .",
    "the pbe@xcite and blyp@xcite functionals are used for the gga calculations . for the hybrid functional calculations , the hse functional@xcite has been applied .",
    "we use a variant of the hse06 functional that observes the homogeneous electron gas limit and all important sum rules .",
    "contrary to the conventional hse06 functional , the screening parameter is set to @xmath8@xmath9 in both the semi - local as well as non - local part of the exchange functional , whereas the recommended choice is @xmath10@xmath9 . as has been shown previously , the specific choice of the screening parameter @xmath11 has very little influence on the total energies , but slightly affects band gaps.@xcite throughout this paper we will use the acronym hse for this functional . as we have shown elsewhere , for cu , rh and pt the hse functional yields the same site order and almost the same energetics as the more popular hybrid pbeh ( sometimes also termed pbe0 or pbe1pbe ) functional@xcite ( see ref .   for details ) .",
    "furthermore the widely adopted b3lyp@xcite functional is applied in the present work .",
    "the difference to the previous functional is predominantly in the correlation energy which is approximated using the semi - local lee - yang - parr correlation .",
    "systematic tests for selected extended systems are described elsewhere.@xcite implementational details can be found in ref . .",
    "for the pbe and hse functionals , the bulk metal lattice constants were optimized and used in the periodic slab calculations . in order to save compute time",
    ", the blyp and b3lyp calculations were performed at the hse geometries , which also agree best with experiment .",
    "lattice constants @xmath12( ) of late @xmath0 and @xmath1 transition metals in the fcc structure using different functionals .",
    "experimental lattice constants of ru and os have been calculated from the experimental hcp volume assuming an fcc structure .",
    "experimental values are taken from ref .  .",
    "numbers in round brackets are the relative error ( in percent ) with respect to the experimental lattice constants .",
    "the experimental lattice constants have not been extrapolated to 0 k , and the zero - point quantum fluctuations have not been included in the calculations .",
    "inclusion of these contributions will change the values by approximately @xmath130.1  % @xcite . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the second step we evaluated the co adsorption energy at the fcc and top site for a @xmath14 slab using these three potentials and @xmath15 k - points ( similar technical parameters were applied in ref .  ) .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ tab:1 ] . at the pbe level ,",
    "all three potentials give very similar results to those of ref .  .",
    "large differences are observed at the pbeh level .",
    "the standard nc potential yields the same site order as in ref .",
    "( but different adsorption energies ) , whereas the nc@xmath16 potential treating the @xmath17 and @xmath18 electrons explicitly as valence and the paw method show that the top and fcc site are practically degenerate for this setup . for a lower coverage using a @xmath19 surface cell and using more @xmath20 points , the fcc site is consistently preferred by 0.04 ev for the pbeh functional . we conclude : the pbeh functional does not predict the right site order on pt(111 ) in the low coverage limit . also the adsorption energy is significantly overestimated by the hybrid pbeh functional , and _ overall the description is thus not improved over the gga case_.@xcite furthermore , normconserving transition metal potentials generated using lda / gga functionals must be used with great care in hybrid functional calculations .",
    "we believe that this rule also applies to elements beyond the third row ( @xmath21 , @xmath18 and @xmath22 elements ) , where the core valence overlap is often appreciable ."

    "<S> a study of the adsorption of co on late @xmath0 and @xmath1 transition metal ( 111 ) surfaces ( ru , rh , pd , ag , os , ir , and pt ) considering atop and hollow site adsorption is presented . </S>",

    "<S> we find that pbe based hybrid functionals ( specifically hse ) yield , with the exception of pt , the correct site order on all considered metals , but they also considerably overestimate the adsorption energies compared to experiment . on the other hand , the semi - local blyp functional and the corresponding hybrid functional b3lyp yield very satisfactory adsorption energies and the correct adsorption site for all surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> we are thus faced with a procrustean problem : the b3lyp and blyp functionals seem to be the overall best choice for describing adsorption on metal surfaces , but they simultaneously fail to account well for the properties of the metal , vastly overestimating the equilibrium volume and underestimating the atomization energies .    setting out from these observations , general conclusions are drawn on the relative merits and drawbacks of various semi - local and hybrid functionals . </S>",
    "<S> the discussion includes a revised version of the pbe functional specifically optimized for bulk properties and surface energies ( pbesol ) , a revised version of the pbe functional specifically optimized to predict accurate adsorption energies ( rpbe ) , as well as the aforementioned blyp functional . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that no semi - local functional is capable to describe all aspects properly , and including non - local exchange also only improves some , but worsens other properties . </S>"
