    "time correlation functions of wavenumber dependent collective number density and orientational fluctuations in a molecular liquid play important role in understanding many microscopic aspects of dynamics in molecular liquids .",
    "the wavenumber dependent collective correlation functions of fluctuations bridge the gap between the single particle relaxation and the relaxation in the hydrodynamic limit ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) @xcite .",
    "these correlation functions can be measured in the experiments such as light scattering and inelastic neutron scattering @xcite . in the hydrodynamic limit",
    ", the expressions of these correlation functions can be obtained from the linearized navier - stokes equations @xcite .",
    "this linearized hydrodynamic model and various molecular extensions of them have been useful in interpreting the results obtained from the computer simulations and the experiments of simple liquids in equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the time correlation function analysis of the liquid state uses well - known expressions for the transport coefficients and the hydrodynamic behavior .",
    "such an analysis includes the wavelengths and frequencies that are comparable to inter atomic distances and microscopic relaxation rates .",
    "deviations from the hydrodynamic behavior often appear in this analysis above some critical wavenumber .",
    "the wavenumbers near this critical distance may be referred as intermediate wavenumbers . even after many years of investigation by different researchers ,",
    "a complete microscopic understanding of the relaxation of collective fluctuation in liquids remains incomplete . at intermediate wavenumber ,",
    "the correlation functions of collective fluctuations deviate from their hydrodynamic behavior ; here the distance referred to is comparable to that of inter particle separation .",
    "the collective relaxation in the intermediate wavenumber regime can be treated in the framework of extended hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "in contrast to simple liquids , the studies of molecular liquids are bound to be complex due to the presence of the internal degrees of freedom , which couple to the conserved modes and act as additional relaxation channels for fluctuation .",
    "compared to simple liquids , there are several parameters of intermolecular potential , like aspect ratio and geometry of molecule , which may affect the microscopic relaxation of molecular liquids @xcite .",
    "there are several attempts to study the relaxation of the hydrodynamic modes in molecular liquids , however , such an analysis near the i - n transition is found to be absent in the literature .",
    "it is interesting to study this aspect of i - n transition , especially in the context of the recent experimental results by fayer and coworkers @xcite , where the orientational degree of freedom shows relaxation dynamics similar to that found in supercooled liquids . in another work li _",
    "@xcite presented a mode coupling theory which could reproduce the results observed in the experiments .",
    "however , they did not provide origin of the mode which couples to the orientational degrees of freedom . on the other hand ,",
    "the experimental study of collective relaxation of other modes show the signature of the second order phase transition @xcite . in the dynamic light scattering experiments near the i - n transition , the spectra of the orientational degrees of freedom mask dynamics of other modes .",
    "mode - selective dynamic light scattering experiments of takagi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite on 5cb and 7cb liquid crystal samples have studied the dynamics of modes usually hidden under fluctuation of the orientational mode .",
    "they have measured the thermal diffusion , orientational relaxation and propagating sound modes of those liquid crystal samples . using photopyroelectric technique , marinelly _ et .",
    "al _ @xcite have measured the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of aligned ncb samples .",
    "they have found that the thermal conductivity shows a discontinuity near the i - n transition , while , the thermal diffusivity shows a dip . in older studies of ultrasonic investigations of eden _",
    "@xcite on mbba samples with out any preferred orientation with emphasis given near transition temperature @xmath8 44 @xmath9 , they found the acoustic relaxation time and relaxation strength increases near i - n transition .",
    "it is now worth while to study effect of i - n transition on conserved degrees of freedom and also on the thermodynamic and transport properties . in this paper",
    ", the study of the collective transport properties of the nematogens has been restricted chiefly to the pre - transition region , where , even though there is an anisotropy due to the formation of pseudo nematic domains , they relax slowly to remove the anisotropy .",
    "however , as the orientational relaxation slows down close to the i - n transition , the relaxation of the anisotropy also slows down .",
    "since the i - n transition is weakly first order , there are prolonged pre - transitional effects , which enable the observation of the effect of orientational ordering in the structural relaxation for a range of state points across i - n transition .",
    "since i - n transition occurs due the formation of the orientational cage that freezes rotation of the molecules , as the i - n transition is approached , the exchange of the angular momentum with the cage gives rise to a strong back scattering region in the angular velocity auto correlation function ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it is of course of interest to study what signatures the formation and melting of pseudo - nematic domains have on the transport properties , like thermal diffusivity , and also on the thermodynamic properties like sound velocity and specific heat .",
    "earlier we presented a study of the variation of viscosity which shows weak anomaly across the isotropic - nematic phase transition .",
    "the present study is a continuation of our earlier study @xcite but now extended to include many thermodynamic and transport properties . just as in the case of viscosity ,",
    "it is not clear in the beginning what role formation of orientational order can have on properties which are largely determined by translational degrees of freedom .",
    "investigations reported in this paper are based on the simulation of a model molecular liquid with aspect ratio @xmath10 and can be approximated by prolate ellipsoids with two of the minor axis are equal .",
    "as reported earlier @xcite , this system undergoes an i - n transition as the density increases from @xmath11 = 0.285 to @xmath11 = 0.315 , gradually along an isotherm at @xmath12 = 1.0 .",
    "the single particle relaxation dynamics in this system shows usual behavior as that of an ordinary liquid , except the presence of a marked anisotropy near i- n transition .",
    "the present study on the relaxation of fluctuation of collective density modes focuses on the relaxation dynamics at different wavenumbers .",
    "the intermediate scattering function calculated from the simulations is fitted to the linearized hydrodynamic model of the intermediate scattering function in order to find the thermodynamic and transport properties of the system .",
    "thermodynamic and transport properties obtained from the fitting parameters show non - monotonic behavior at different state points across the i - n transition . the sound velocity obtained from the peak position of the brillouin peak @xcite shows that the adiabatic sound velocity increases across the i - n transition ; except a deviation from it s monotonic increase near the transition .",
    "an important ( and we believe ) new result of the present study is the appearance of anisotropy in the wavenumber dependence of the dynamic structure factor , f(k , t ) . the latter becomes a function of the direction of propagation of wavevector , @xmath13 .",
    "the remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows .",

    "but , near the i - n transition due to the freezing of individual rotation of the molecules , the anisotropy persists for long , which makes the density relaxation anisotropic .",

    "there is no direction for the anisotropy .",
    "near the i - n transition , in the isotropic liquid , the anisotropy is due to the coupling of number density to the transient director of the system . in the case of the supercooled liquids",

    "the sharp fall in @xmath5 shows that mean square enthalpy ( @xmath74 ) fluctuations decreases compared to the same for energy ( @xmath75 ) fluctuations .",
    "if we write the enthalpy change at constant pressure as @xmath76 , then the present result suggests that a positive change in @xmath77 ( melting of pseudo - nematic domains to the isotropic phase ) is accompanied by a negative change in energy , which is in accordance with the understanding that the nematic phase has lower internal energy than the isotropic phase . on the other hand",
    ", the formation of a local nematic domain due to interaction with the propagating sound wave can give rise to a negative @xmath77 and positive @xmath75 .",
    "similarly , increase of sound attenuation is due to the interaction of the sound propagation with the melting / formation of pseudo - nematic domains which consumes energy from the sound wave .",
    "in this paper we have presented a study of i - n transition from the perspective of molecular hydrodynamics using molecular dynamics simulations . in a system of 1125 particles",
    "the smallest wavenumber that can be studied is approximately is @xmath78 in the range of the number densities @xmath11 = 0.285 to @xmath11 = 0.32 .",
    "the calculation finds a fairly well defined brillouin peak in the range of the wavenumbers studied .",
    "these simulations show the role of density fluctuation and the orientational ordering in development of anisotropy at intermediate wavenumebrs in the density relaxation near the i - n transition .",
    "however , at large wavenumbers the calculation shows only marginal evidence for the existence and propagation of the density fluctuations .",
    "the main results of this work are that it shows the effect of the formation of the director on the relaxation of fluctuations of the collective density of the system .",
    "a fit of intermediate scattering function to the linearized hydrodynamic model at small wavenumbers ( @xmath64 ) show the variation of the thermodynamic as well as transport properties across i - n transition .",
    "the ratio of the specific heats shows a discontinuity - like feature near the i - n transition .",
    "the thermal diffusion shows a dip ; a similar behavior is reported in the recent experiments of marinelly _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "the sound dispersion coefficient also shows a divergence like behavior near i - n transition . the sound velocity calculated from the peak position if the brillouin peak deviate from its monotonic increase near i - n transition",
    "also that is in qualitative agreement with the experimental results of eden @xcite _",
    "et al._.    this work demonstrates the effect of spatial and temporal propagation of anisotropy of the molecular potential in the medium at different state points across the i - n transition . also effect of this in the thermodynamic and transport coefficients .",
    "thus during the i - n transition the system shows the non - ergodicity due to the formation of director , that slowly relaxes due to the mutual coupling of the orientation within a pseudo nematic domain .",
    "our results qualitatively agrees with experimental results even though the potential used is a simple ellipsoidal model .",
    "this shows that these results are related directly the anisotropy of the inter molecular potential .    in the context of continuing interest of the comparison between the dynamics of supercooled liquid and liquid crystals@xcite",
    ", it is interesting to note that the anomalies observed in sound attenuation and sound absorption coefficients are not known to exist ( at least significantly ) in the former .",
    "this outlines the uniqueness of the liquid crystalline systems where large pseudo - nematic domains form and melts near the i - n boundary .",
    "such a physical process does not exist in the supercooled liquid at a thermodynamic level .",
    "we have argued that most of the features observed can be qualitatively understood from the melting / formation of the pseudo - nematic domains .",
    "a complete theory of the observed hydrodynamic anomalies need to consider translation - rotation coupling@xcite and is yet to be developed .",
    "we are not aware of the existence of any theoretical treatment of the effects of slow down in the decay of the orientational time correlation function of nematogens near their i - n transition , on the isotropic dynamic structure factor . in earlier study , we have reported observation of an anomalous viscoelasticity of the nematogens near the i - n transition.@xcite both the problems require inclusion of the effects of orientational slow down on the isotropic density relaxation .",
    "this is clearly a non - linear problem .",
    "while the orientational order parameter s is a non - conserved order parameter , the isotropic density @xmath79 is a conserved order parameter .",
    "the landau - de gennes - ginzburg free energy for the isotropic phase of the liquid crystal can be written down without much difficulty .",
    "however , difficulty lies in the fact that the total free energy function should be a functional of both @xmath80 and @xmath81 , with a coupling between the two fields .",
    "a molecular hydrodynamic theory along the above line needs to be developed but still appears to be non - existing .",
    "a valid criticism of the present work is the finite size of the system simulated , although n=1125 is quite large ( and demanding ) for long md simulations , particularly when orientational degree of freedom is present .",
    "also note that gay - berne is quite a complex potential to study .",
    "in addition to n=1125 , we have also studied extensively the size n=500 .",
    "the basic features remain unchanged .",
    "nevertheless , the k>0 limit is expected to be sensitive to the system size , and a system size dependent study of the present results could be a worthwhile exercise .",
    "the intermediate wavenumber results , however , are not expected to be sensitive to system size .",
    "it will be worthwhile to study this range by neutron scattering ."
