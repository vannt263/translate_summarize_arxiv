    "interest in pursuit - evasion differential games ( _ pe games _ ) involving several players dates back to the 1960 s .",
    "progress in this field is documented in the classical differential games literature , which includes the books by isaacs @xcite , pontryagin @xcite , friedman @xcite , krasovskii and subbotin @xcite . constructing optimal strategies for each player , finding the value of the game , deriving optimality conditions for the trajectories and establishing conditions for solvability of the game are typical objectives .",
    "the case of several agents , although it can be considered as a special case of the general framework for the problem , has been addressed separately by many authors .",
    "an early significant contribution was that of pshenichnii @xcite , who studied the problem with many pursuers and equal speeds and derived necessary and sufficient conditions for solutions to this problem .",
    "ivanov and ledyaev @xcite subsequently studied the optimal pursuit in higher dimensional state spaces , with several pursuers and geometrical constraints . through the study of an auxiliary problem , related to the interaction between one pursuer and the evader and using a lyapunov function , they obtained sufficient conditions of optimality .",
    "chodun @xcite and more recently ibragimov @xcite used the same approach to solve a collection of one to one problems ( one pursuer one evader ) for problems with simple dynamic constraints .",
    "differential games , and multi - agent pe games in particular , have found applications in a variety of fields , for example in mathematical economics , where a game has been constructed to model the relation between agents @xcite , in robotics where typically the emphasis is real time solutions and efficient computational methods . @xcite .    our proposed approach is to decompose the original game into a family of simpler , lower - dimensional games .",
    "this is achieve by expressing the original set as a union of smaller , target subsets .",
    "the individual differential games in the family result from the replacing the original target set by each of the target subsets .",
    "special geometric features of the dynamic constraints and constraints can be exploited to reduce the complexity of the new problems generated in this way . making use of verification techniques originally proposed by isaacs @xcite , properties of viscosity solutions and techniques of nonsmooth analysis @xcite , we give we a lower - envelope characterization of the value function , and show how to construct optimal strategies for the original problem from those for the simpler problems .",
    "a similar decomposition technique was used in @xcite .",
    "the state @xmath0 of a dynamic system , partitioned as @xmath1-vector components @xmath2 , is governed by the equations @xmath3 in which @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are given functions .    for each @xmath7",
    "we interpret the state component @xmath8 to be the relative position of the evader with respect to the @xmath7th pursuer .",
    "the dimension of the state vector @xmath0 is therefore @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath10 vector @xmath11 comprises the @xmath1-vector pursuer controls and @xmath12 is the @xmath1-vector evader control .",
    "the pursuer and evader controls @xmath13 and @xmath12 take values in the sets @xmath14 for some given numbers @xmath15 .",
    "define @xmath16    it is assumed that    ( h ) : @xmath17 , @xmath18 are lipschitz continuous , and    @xmath19 .",
    "note that the maximum allowable magnitude of the velocity of the @xmath7th pursuer depends on the states of all the pursuers and the evader , via the functions @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we may assume , without loss of generality that the @xmath23 s and @xmath24 s are positive functions , since the constraint sets @xmath25 and @xmath26 are symmetric about the origin .",
    "take the target set to be @xmath27 in which @xmath28 is a specified number .",
    "denote by @xmath29 the solution of , for given initial state @xmath30 and controls @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "define the hitting time for ( given @xmath30 , @xmath13 and @xmath12 ) to be @xmath33 the player with control @xmath13 ( comprising the pursuers ) seeks to minimize the hitting time , while the evader player , with control @xmath12 , seeks to maximize it .",
    "it is convenient to transform the hitting time cost by means of the mapping @xmath34 the cost becomes : @xmath35 the transformation modifies the value function , but leaves unaltered the optimal strategies , owing to the fact that the transformation is monotone .",
    "full specification of the differential game requires precise description of the nature of the control strategies involved . for this purpose",
    ", we follow the elliot / kalton approach , based on the concept of ` non - anticipative ' strategies .",
    "the set of such strategies for the @xmath13-player is @xmath36(s)=\\alpha[\\tilde{b}](s ) \\hbox { for all } s\\leq t \\}\\;.",

    "the common value defines the value function @xmath39 for the game .",
    "thus @xmath40 for all @xmath30 .",
    "_ it can be shown that , under the state assumptions , the value function is the unique uniformly continuous function @xmath41 , which vanishes on on @xmath42 and which is a viscosity solution on @xmath43 of the following hamilton - jacobi - isaacs equation @xmath44 where the hamiltonian is @xmath45 _    furthermore , the value function is locally lipschitz continuous .    solving this equation for the value function of the game , yields the optimal strategy of each player for initial state @xmath46 as @xmath47 and @xmath48 where    @xmath49    @xmath50    * example 1 .",
    "* we examine a simple , preliminary example .",
    "consider the pursuit - evasion game with two pursuers @xmath51 and one evader @xmath52 , and the positions of each evolve in 1d space .",
    "we take the dynamics to be @xmath53 where @xmath54 $ ] , @xmath55 .",
    "the speed constraint on pursuers is assumed to be greater than that of the evader ; this ensures that the optimal hitting time is finite for an arbitrary initial finite state .",
    "let us now consider a reduced formulation .",
    "we translate the origin to the position of the e - player , so the @xmath7th state variable becomes the position of the evader relative to that of the @xmath7th pursuer .",
    "there results the reduced dynamics @xmath56 here we have @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "the target set @xmath59 becomes the union of neighbourhoods the two axes : capture occurs when @xmath60 , for some specified @xmath61 .",

    "we now propose a decomposition technique to address this challenge .",
    "in this section we present a decomposition technique to overcome the complexity of the multiple pursuer game introduced in section 2 , for high state dimensions .",
    "the key idea is to decompose the target set @xmath42 as a union of smaller sets @xmath64 , @xmath65 : @xmath66 and to relate the value function @xmath39 for the original game to the value functions @xmath67 for the games in which the @xmath64 s replace @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath67 s are viscosity solutions to the hji equation above , with modified boundary condition : @xmath68    under the hypotheses , the @xmath67 s are lipschitz continuous .",

    "_ proof outline .",
    "_ define @xmath81 our aim is to show that @xmath82 coincides with @xmath39 .",
    "since @xmath82 vanishes on @xmath42 , and in view of the facts that @xmath82 is lipschitz continuous and that @xmath39 is the unique uniformly continuous viscosity solution to the hji equation satisfying this boundary condition , it suffices to show that @xmath82 is such a solution .    that @xmath82 is a super ( viscosity ) solution follows directly from the definition of super solution and the fact that @xmath82 is the lower envelope of a finite number of super solutions .",
    "it remains to show then that @xmath82 is a sub solution .",
    "take any @xmath83 and any @xmath84 . according to a well - known characterization of sub solutions",
    ", it suffices to demonstrate that @xmath85 but , by the ` max rule ' for limiting subdifferentials of lipschitz continuous functions , applied to @xmath86 , we know that , for some convex combination @xmath87 and set of vectors @xmath88 .",
    "@xmath89 for each @xmath90 , there exists sequences @xmath91 and @xmath92 such that , for each @xmath7 , @xmath93 as @xmath94 . since @xmath67 is a subsolution , @xmath95 .",
    "but then , since @xmath96 is continuous , @xmath97 it follows from condition ( [ convex ] ) that @xmath98 then @xmath99 we have confirmed ( [ valid ] ) .",
    "we now discuss the role the decomposition technique , summarized as theorem [ t:1 ] , in reducing the complexity of the differential game .",

    "this feature of the solution is evident from the formulae for the value function , which reveal that , for states far from the @xmath105 axis but close to the @xmath104 ( for example ) , the value function coincides with the function @xmath122 .",
