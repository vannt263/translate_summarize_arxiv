    "the nature of this compenent , dubbed dark energy ( de ) , is still open for debate .",
    "candidates range from false vacuum , yielding a positive cosmological constant @xmath0 , to a self  interacting scalar field @xmath4 ( ratra & peebles 1988 ; wetterich 1988 ) to even more exotic physics of extra dimensions ( e.g. , dvali & turner 2003 ) .",
    "while the observed value of @xmath0 implies a dramatic _ fine  tuning _ of vacuum , at the latest phase transition , @xmath0cdm models provide an excellent fit to data .",
    "alternative viable de models must , first of all , rival their success .",
    "therefore , their phaenomenology must be and _ is _ hardly distinguishable from @xmath0cdm .",
    "this calls for tests able to discriminate between different de natures .    in recent work",
    ", the evolution of the cluster mass function has been shown to have a significant dependence on de nature .",
    "this has been shown first on the basis of a press & schechter ( ps ) formulation ( mainini , macci & bonometto 2003 ) , then using n ",
    "body simulations ( klypin et al . 2003 ; see also linder & jenkins 2003 ) , which confirmed ps findings .",
    "there are a number of other cosmological measures which can contribute to discriminate between different de natures .",
    "this is important also on the light of the point that we wish to make in this paper .",
    "in fact , while the number density of clusters @xmath5 , in a comoving volume , has a significant @xmath6 dependence , the measurable signal is much less significant . on the light of observational uncertainties , it seems unlikely that the nature of de can be easily discriminated along this pattern .    in a sense",
    ", this contradicts the expectations for a number of deep sky surveys ( see , e.g. , davis , gerke & newman 2004 ) based on the ancient intuition of hubble ( 1926 ) , that the number ",
    "redshift relation can be used to determine the geormetry of the world . discriminating the de nature",
    "is much harder than fixing the matter density parameter @xmath7 in a flat @xmath0cdm model .",
    "it is not so because of a reduced impact of de nature on geometry or on @xmath5 , but because their effects on geometry and @xmath5 tend to erase each other .",
    "let us consider a family of objects whose ( cumulative ) mass function is @xmath5 .",
    "indipendently of the actual @xmath6 dependence , the angular number density of objects belonging to such family , with redshift between @xmath6 and @xmath8 , in a spatially flat geometry , reads @xmath9 with @xmath10 . for the models we are considering , it is useful to show that @xmath11 and , therefore , @xmath12 in fact , for flat models , on the past light cone , @xmath13 and , therefore , by dividing the two sides by @xmath14 , we obtain @xmath15 , so that : @xmath16 in turn @xmath17 @xmath18 so that eqs .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:3 ] ) follow .",
    "these equations lead to handable expressions when de has a state equation @xmath19 with constant @xmath20 .",
    "it is then easy to see that @xmath21^{-1/ 2 } , \\label{eq:6}\\ ] ] while @xmath22 can be worked out by integrating from 0 to @xmath6 .",
    "we can also easily differentiate both with respect of @xmath1 and with respect to @xmath20 , finding that @xmath23^{2 } } \\label{eq:7}\\ ] ] and @xmath24^{2 } } ~ , \\label{eq:8}\\ ] ] so that we expect that the geometrical factors increase when @xmath25 increases , whenever @xmath26 , and decrease when @xmath20 increases .",
    "notice that eq .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) is not a functional derivative , as the expression ( [ eq:6 ] ) holds just for constant @xmath20 .",
    "an extension to dynamical de can be however performed by using the interpolating expressions yielding @xmath27 , for rp ( ratra & peebles , 1988 , 1995 ) and sugra ( brax & martin 1999 , 2001 , brax , martin & riazuelo 2000 ) models , provided by mainini et al ( 2004 ) . in these cases",
    "de is due to a scalar field , self  interacting through a potential whose expression depends on an energy scale @xmath0 ( see appendix a for details on the dynamical de models considered here ) . using the interpolating expressions or , equivalently , direct numerical integration",
    ", we obtain the results shown in figure [ fig : geo ] . here the @xmath6 dependence of the geometrical factor @xmath28 is shown for three @xmath0cdm models ( @xmath0cdm 06 , @xmath0cdm 07 , @xmath0cdm 08 , with @xmath29 , 0.3 and 0.2,respectively ) , as is obtainable from eq .",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) . in the same figure",
    "we show the @xmath6 dependence of geometrical factors also for sugra and rp models , with @xmath30 and with the @xmath0 parameter fixed at 10@xmath31gev .",
    "@xmath32 is 70@xmath33km / s / mpc in all models .    in the absence of number density evolution ,",
    "would also show the dependence of the angular number density on @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath0cdm models considered are characterized by quite different values of @xmath1 . among them , only 0.7 approaches available data , which are coherent with an @xmath1 interval not wider than 0.020.03 . in spite of that , the discrepancy between @xmath0cdm 07 and @xmath0cdm 06 only marginally exceeds the discrepancy between sugra and @xmath0cdm 07 and is smaller than the difference between rp and @xmath0cdm 07 .",
    "notice , in particular , that the rp model can be considered as discrepant from data as @xmath0cdm 06 or @xmath0cdm 08 .",
    "altogether , fig .",
    "1 shows how strongly the nature of de affects geometrical factors and that , in the presence of a non  evolving population , an insight into the de equation of state can be provided by the @xmath6 dependence of their angular number density .",
    "a fair insight into the evolution of the number of clusters with the redshift @xmath6 , can be obtained by using a ps expression .",
    "sheth & tormen ( 1999 , 2002 ) as well as jenkins et al ( 2001 ) provided expressions more closely fitting n  body simulations ( which are already reasonably approached by ps results ) .",
    "the latter expressions are more complex and include more parameters , while their use is unessential for the present aims .    the expected ( differential ) cluster number density @xmath34 , at a given time , is then given by the expression @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the matter density , @xmath37 is the so  called _ bias factor _",
    ", @xmath38 is the mass scale considered .",
    "@xmath39 is the r.m.s .",
    "density fluctuation on the scale @xmath38 and @xmath40 is the amplitude that , in the linear theory , fluctuations should have in order that , assuming spherical evolution , full recollapse is attained exactly at the time considered ( in a standard cdm model this value is @xmath411.68 ; the difference , in other model , ranges around a few percent ) . as usual",
    ", we took a gaussian @xmath42 distribution .    together with eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 - 1 ] ) , we must take into account the virialization condition , which yields significantly different density contrasts @xmath43 in different de models .",
    "further details can be found in mainini et al ( 2003 ) .    in figure [",
    "fig : numden ] we show the cumulative cluster number density , @xmath5 , obtained by integrating @xmath34 , for the same models of fig .  1@xmath33 , for @xmath44 .",
    "all models are normalized to the same cluster number today and the redshift dependence of @xmath5 is clearly understandable , on qualitative bases : when @xmath0cdm models are considered , the evolution is faster as we approach standard cdm . hence , @xmath0cdm 08 ( @xmath0cdm 06 ) , being the most distant ( nearest ) model to standard cdm , has the slowest ( fastest ) evolution .",
    "@xmath0cdm 07 just stands in between .",
    "when we compare dynamical de models to @xmath0cdm 07 , we know that they also yield a slower evolution , i.e. structures form earlier in models with @xmath45 .    accordingly , apart of numerical details , the behaviors shown in fig .",
    "2 reasonably fit our expectations .",
    "let us now put together the results shown by figs .  1  &  2 and",
    "evaluate the angular number densities of clusters in redshift intervals @xmath46 with @xmath47 . if @xmath0cdm models are considered , the geometrical factor @xmath48 and the evolutionary factor @xmath5 vary in the same directions , when @xmath1 is modified .    on the contrary , for dynamical de models , the two terms vary in the opposite directions and , therefore ,",
    "model differences tend to erase .",
    "accordingly , the results shown in figure  [ fig : area ] are essentially expected .",
    "it is then easy to argue that testing the differences between cluster numbers is really challenging , when different de models are compared . on the contrary , different @xmath1 s",
    "cause comparatively huge shifts .",
    "data on cluster masses are obtainable either from temperatures @xmath49 or luminosities @xmath50 ( see , e.g. , pierpaoli et al 2004 ) . finding",
    "a fair cluster mass is perhaps the main reason for uncertainty , but also the cluster redshift determination is subject to errors . in figure",
    "[ fig : inc ] we compare the expected mass functions , for the @xmath0cdm 07 and the two dynamical de models considered , at two mass scales ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) , showing also the uncertainty in the halo mass function caused by a 5@xmath53 indetermination in the mass : @xmath54~ ( \\delta m/ m)~ , $ ] still for @xmath55 .",
    "of course , @xmath56 is not easily reachable , on the basis of the present capacity to reconstruct cluster dynamics .",
    "the plots also assume that a complete cluster sample in a solid angle of 1 steradian is available .    using deep cluster distributions , to discriminate de models ,",
    "is therefore hard .",
    "a comparison between the two panels of figure  [ fig : inc ] however shows that differences become wider as we go to smaller masses .",
    "accordingly , on group mass scales , a further enhancement can be expected .",
    "an even stronger difference can be expected , when angular number densities of galaxies are being compared . in particular , comparing the two panels shows that , when lowering the mass scale considered , differences in trends ( vs.  redshift ) are enhanced . on galaxy",
    "mass scales , therefore , the very peaks of distributions could fall at differend redshifts .",
    "predictions for galaxy scales can not be formulated only using a ps recipe , but should include an accurate consideration of how large halos split into galactic objects",
    ". this will be the topic of future research .    before concluding let us however outline that , here above , the dependence on @xmath6 of cluster features has been assumed not to depend on de nature . as a matter of fact ,",
    "when we consider different state equations for de , we change the @xmath6@xmath57 relation and the same redshift corresponds to a different time .",
    "this is true also when @xmath1 is changed , of course .",
    "however , while , in the latter case , this change of the @xmath6@xmath57 relation has a counterpart in a change of halo angular densities , there is no equivalent counterpart in the former case .",
    "comparing the @xmath6@xmath57 relation , obtained from a study of cluster morphologies or galactic evolution , with number density predictions can be therefore a way to discriminate between different de natures .",
    "andrea macci and loris colombo are gratefully thanked for interesting comments .",
    "dynamical de is to be ascribed to a scalar field , @xmath4 , self  interacting through an effective potential @xmath58 , whose dynamics is set by the lagrangian density : @xmath59 here @xmath60 is the determinant of the metric tensor @xmath61 ( @xmath62 is the conformal time ) . in this work",
    "we need to consider just a spatially homogeneous @xmath4 ( @xmath63 ; @xmath64 ; dots denote differentiation with respect to @xmath65 ) ; the equation of motion then reads : @xmath66 energy density and pressure , obtained from the energy ",
    "momentum tensor @xmath67 , are : @xmath68 so that the state parameter @xmath69 changes with time and is negative as soon as the potential term @xmath58 takes large enough values .",
    "the evolution of dynamical de depends on details of the effective potential @xmath58 .",
    "here we referred to models proposed by ratra & peebles ( rp : 1988 , 1995 ) , yielding a rather slow evolution of @xmath20 , and brax & martin ( sugra : 1999 , 2001 , see also brax , martin & riazuelo 2000 ) yielding a much faster evolving @xmath20 .",
    "altogether , rp and sugra potentials cover a large spectrum of evolving @xmath20 .",
    "they read @xmath70 @xmath71 these potentials allow tracker solutions , yielding the same low@xmath6 behavior , almost independently of initial conditions . in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1a ] ) and ( [ eq:2a ] ) , @xmath0 is an energy scale , currently set in the range @xmath72@xmath73gev , relevant for the physics of fundamental interactions .",
    "the potentials depend also on the exponent @xmath74 .",
    "fixing @xmath0 and @xmath74 , the de density parameter @xmath75 is determined .",
    "here we rather use @xmath0 and @xmath75 as independent parameters .",
    "in particular , numerical results are given for @xmath76gev .",
    "the rp model with such @xmath0 value is in slight disagreement with low-@xmath77 multipoles of the cmb anisotropy spectrum data .",
    "agreement may be recovered with smaller @xmath0 s , which however loose significance in particle physics .",
    "the sugra model considered here , on the contrary , is in fair agreement with all available data .",
