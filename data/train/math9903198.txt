    "the problem of describing all finite - dimensional lie algebras of vector fields is a starting point for the symmetry analysis of ordinary differential equations , because , having solved this problem , one finds all possible algebras of contact symmetries for ordinary differential equations .    over the complex numbers this classification",
    "was done at the end of the last century by sophus lie  @xcite .",
    "he showed that , with three exceptions , all lie algebras of contact vector fields , viewed up to equivalence , are lifts of lie algebras of vector fields on the plane .",
    "the largest algebra of the three exceptions ( so - called _ irreducible algebras of contact vector fields _ ) is the algebra of contact symmetries of the equation @xmath0 and is isomorphic to @xmath1 , while the other two are its subalgebras of dimension 6 and  7 .    in this paper",
    "we show that the problem of describing algebras of vector fields can be formulated in a natural way in terms of filtered and graded lie algebras .",
    "this allows not only to give a new up - to - date proof of sophus lie s classification , which is as yet missing in the literature , but also to solve this problem over the field of real numbers .",
    "it turns out that in the real case there are 8  irreducible contact lie algebras of vector fields on the plane , and one of them involves an arbitrary parameter .",
    "lie algebras of vector fields on the plane were also classified ( both in real and complex case ) by sophus lie  @xcite , so that the description of irreducible lie algebras of vector fields on the plane which is given in the present paper , basically concludes the description of all finite - dimensional contact lie algebras of vector fields over the field of real numbers .",
    "it should be noted that the problem of finding all irreducible contact lie algebras over the real numbers was also considered by f.  engel in  @xcite , which is mentioned in sophus lie s three - volume treatise  @xcite ( volume 3 , chapter  29 , pages  760761 ) .",

    "therefore , the lie algebra  @xmath45 admits a unique ( up to local equivalence ) realization as a transitive lie algebra of contact vector fields .",
    "thus , the local classification of finite - dimensional transitive lie algebras of contact vector fields on  @xmath36 is equivalent to the classification ( up to isomorphism ) of the corresponding contact lie algebras .",

    "if @xmath45 is a contact lie algebra , then it is clear that the associated graded lie algebra @xmath99 satisfies all three conditions in the above definition and is therefore a graded contact lie algebra .",

    "therefore , up to isomorphism of contact lie algebras we may assume that @xmath253 .",
    "if @xmath254 , we find that @xmath45 is again isomorphic to  @xmath100 , viewed as a filtered lie algebra .",
    "if @xmath255 or @xmath256 , the lie algebra  @xmath45 is isomorphic to @xmath186 or  @xmath257 respectively , while the subalgebras  @xmath45 can be written , under this identification , in matrix form as follows : @xmath258    summing up what has been said , we obtain the following result :    any finite - dimensional irreducible contact lie algebra is isomorphic to one and only one of the following :    * any of the graded contact lie algebras listed in theorem  [ thm1 ] , if they are viewed as filtered lie algebras ; * @xmath259 , where @xmath260 for @xmath109 , @xmath261 * @xmath262 , where @xmath260 for @xmath109 , @xmath263    from now on , to refer to irreducible contact algebras of type  i , we shall employ the notation i.@xmath264 , where @xmath264 is the number of the corresponding graded contact lie algebra in theorem  [ thm1 ] .",

    "we immediately obtain the explicit representations in vector fields for those contact algebras  @xmath45 which are isomorphic to their corresponding graded algebras .",
    "in particular , from the representations ( a ) and  ( b ) it follows that these two algebras of contact vector fields can both be embedded into the 10dimensional algebra  i.1 and into the 8dimensional algebra  i.4 .",
    "the representations  ( c ) are notable for the fact that the characteristic functions here are independent of  @xmath272 .",

    "it is easy to show that this condition is equivalent to the requirement that @xmath26  be an infinitesimal symmetry of the one - dimensional distribution  @xmath47 generated by the vector field @xmath277 .",

    "conversely , the inverse image of any subalgebra of the lie algebra  ( [ eq : pr ] ) of vector fields on the plane is some lie algebra of contact vector fields in the jet space .",
    "note that all irreducible lie algebras of contact vector fields , except i.1 and  i.4 , preserve a one - dimensional distribution complementary to the contact distribution , and hence can be embedded into  @xmath278 .",
    "the corresponding lie algebras of vector fields on the plane are as follows :    * the lie algebra corresponding to the group of affine transformations of the plane ; * the lie algebra corresponding to the group of equi - affine transformations of the plane ( ie , area - preserving affine transformations ) ; * the lie algebra corresponding to the group of similitude transformations ; * @xmath284 , @xmath285 ( if @xmath246 , this lie algebra corresponds to the group of euclidean transformations ) ; * the lie algebra corresponding to the group of all transformations of the hyperbolic plane ; * the lie algebra corresponding to the group of rotations of the sphere .",
    "the above correspondence allows to describe without any difficulty all differential and integral invariants for all lie algebras  @xmath45 of contact vector fields that satisfy the following conditions :      indeed , let @xmath287 be the standard coordinate system in the space @xmath288 of @xmath264th jets of curves on the plane .",

    "for example , the contact transformation @xmath305 takes the contact lie algebra i.5 to the algebra with the following space ( over @xmath304 ) of characteristic functions : @xmath306 this contact lie algebra is reducible and is the first prolongation of the following lie algebra of vector fields on the plain : @xmath307 the differential invariants of the least order for this lie algebra were computed already ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) and have the form :       the third prolongation of the inverse transformation @xmath308 takes these invariants to those given in the table above . in the similar way we can compute invariants for other contact lie algebras of vector fields given in the table .",

    "as in the finite - dimensional case , all these algebras can be naturally divided into two classes : reducible ones , which are actually extensions of infinite - dimensional lie algebras of vector fields on the plane , and irreducible ones . over the field of complex numbers",
    "all irreducible infinite - dimensional lie algebras of contact vector fields were described by sophus lie  @xcite , who showed that , apart from the lie algebra of all contact vector fields , there exist exactly two infinite - dimensional irreducible subalgebras , namely , the lie algebra @xmath309 , which we already mentioned earlier , and its commutant @xmath310=\\{x_{g(x , z)}\\}$ ] .",
