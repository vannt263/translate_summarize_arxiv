    "actually this behavior depends on the choice that we have made for the non - dimensionalization .",
    "involving the disks permeability for defining the new timescale @xmath152 instead of @xmath153 , we obtain the rescaled growth - rate @xmath145 shown in the right - panel of  .",
    "this representation shows that the growth - rate @xmath154 reaches a constant value for very high permeabilities ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "this observation immediately implies that the following power law @xmath156 holds in the original units when @xmath157 .    in conclusion ,",
    "the above simplified model explains why the growth - rate of the purely toroidal mode goes to zero when @xmath158 .",
    "the model shows also that although the dominant purely toroidal mode is localized to a very small volume , its decay time determines the overall decay of the axisymmetric azimuthal magnetic field .",
    "note finally that this mode would not be observed in numerical simulations of vks - dynamos that use the idealized boundary condition @xmath114 on the disk s surface ( see e.g.  ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the influence of thin high permeability disks on a vks - like dynamo model .",
    "this work goes well beyond the study of in the sense that we investigate thoroughly the axisymmetric mode and present novel details on the scaling behavior of the dynamo @xmath59-mode .",
    "the high permeability disks facilitate the occurrence of non - axisymmetric dynamo action by enhancing the growth - rate of the equatorial dynamo @xmath59-mode . compared to the idealized limit ( @xmath159 ) the presence of a finite but high permeability material adds a small supplementary damping effect and therefore slightly increases the dynamo threshold .",
    "we propose that the observed @xmath75-scaling for the dynamo threshold can be explained by a skin - effect so that that the disk s role on the @xmath59-mode is quite passive .",
    "although the reduction of the magnetic reynolds number is substantial ( from @xmath160 at @xmath56 to @xmath161 in the limit @xmath162 ) the spatial structure of the @xmath59-mode is hardly changed .",
    "the effects of the high permeability of the impeller disks on the axisymmetric mode turn out to be more fundamental . in the presence of a mean flow the axisymmetric @xmath55-modes",
    "are split up in two separate families , one consisting of a purely toroidal mode and one consisting of a mixed mode composed of a poloidal and a toroidal component .",
    "the growth - rate of the mixed @xmath55-mode slightly increases with @xmath46 but is nearly independent of the disk permeability .",
    "the growth - rate of the purely toroidal @xmath55-mode is not significantly influenced by the flow amplitude , but it is considerably enhanced @xmath163 for large values of @xmath60 .",
    "this selective enhancement of the purely toroidal @xmath55-mode can be explained qualitatively by paramagnetic pumping . a simplified analytical model that interprets the purely toroidal mode as a localized free decay solution confirms the scaling obtained in the numerical simulations .",
    "this slowly decaying purely toroidal mode promoted through the high permeability disks may play an important role in axisymmetric dynamo action .",
    "however , in our simple axisymmetric set - up no possibility for a closure of the dynamo cycle is provided since the poloidal component remains decoupled from the dominant toroidal field so that such dynamo remains impossible @xcite .",
    "our study shows that the ideal boundary conditions @xmath149 is indeed a reasonable assumption for the @xmath59-mode , but it is not appropriate for the analysis of the toroidal @xmath55-mode .",
    "the purely toroidal @xmath55-mode can be obtained only by explicitly considering the internal permeability distribution and the corresponding jump conditions at the fluid / disk interface .",
    "this mode can not be obtained numerically by simulations of vks - like dynamos that use either the idealized boundary condition @xmath164 at the fluid / disk interface or the thin - wall approximation from .    in conclusion , we have seen that the high ( but finite ) permeability in the impeller disks is very important to promote axisymmetric modes in our model and we suppose that it may also play a nontrivial role in the real vks experiment .",
    "for example , in the presence of more complex ( non - axisymmetric ) flows containing small scale turbulence modeled by an @xmath7-effect @xcite , or in the presence of non - axisymmetric permeability distributions that resemble the soft - iron blades attached to the disks @xcite , the purely toroidal @xmath55-modes can be coupled with poloidal field components thus providing the required mechanism to close the dynamo loop ."
