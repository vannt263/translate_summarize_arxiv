    "neutrino reactions on @xmath0ar were of astrophysical importance because they may be used to detect the solar neutrino emitted from @xmath1b via the pp - chains in the sun .",
    "the reactions are measured through the liquid argon time projection chamber ( lartpc ) at the icarus ( imaging of cosmic and rare underground signals ) @xcite . since the maximum energy of the solar neutrino is thought to be about 17 mev in the standard solar model , the neutrino reactions are naturally sensitive on the low - lying discrete energy states of @xmath0ar .",
    "since the protons in @xmath0ar are occupied mostly at the @xmath9 shell while the neutrons are located up to the @xmath10 shell , charge exchange reactions ( cex ) on the nucleus are closely related to the multi - particle and multi - hole interactions of the both major shells .",
    "for instance , the q - value for the @xmath0ar(@xmath11@xmath0k@xmath12 reaction is 1.50 mev , while the q - value for the @xmath0ar(@xmath13@xmath0cl@xmath12 reaction is 7.48 mev , 5 times larger than the @xmath2 reaction .",
    "therefore , @xmath0ar(@xmath14@xmath0cl@xmath12 reactions might be kinematically disfavored in the low energy neutrino , such as solar neutrino , reactions .",
    "moreover , in @xmath0cl@xmath12 , only 2 excited states for the gamow teller ( gt ) transition are known with no excited isobaric analogue states ( isb ) . in this respect , @xmath0ar was thought to effectively distinguish the @xmath2 and @xmath4 emitted from the sun .",
    "recently , authors in ref .",
    "@xcite revised their previous works @xcite in order to discuss the possible detection of neutrino oscillation of supernova ( sn ) neutrinos .",
    "the neutrinos emitted from the sn explosion can give valuable information about neutrino properties , such as the @xmath15 mixing angle @xmath16 and the mass hierarchy , because they traverse regions of dense matter in the exploding star where matter enhanced oscillations take place .",
    "here we briefly discuss such feasibility about how to extract such neutrino properties .",
    "one possible way is to investigate the abundances of light nuclei . among the light nuclei , @xmath17li and @xmath18b",
    "are abundantly produced through the @xmath15-process ( @xmath15-induced reactions on related nuclei in the core collapsing supernova ) @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath15-induced reaction might be sensitive on the @xmath15-properties as well as @xmath15-flavors , the @xmath17li and @xmath18b abundances could be sensitive on the @xmath15 parameters .",
    "for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite , the production yields of @xmath17li and @xmath18b are shown to be sensitive on the neutrino mass hierarchy as well as the emitted neutrino temperature , although some other interpretations are still remained @xcite .",
    "another way is to directly detect the @xmath15 signals coming from the core collapsing sn explosion on the earth @xcite .",
    "the lartpc was suggested as one of possibilities to enable such detection .",
    "this icarus - like detector is also planned to detect the neutrino beam at cern @xcite .",
    "since neutrino energies from the sn explosion are expected to have tens of mev , which are higher than those stemmed from the solar neutrino @xcite , one needs to consider the contributions from higher multi - pole transitions as well as high - lying excited states .",
    "@xcite exploited the rpa calculation done by kolbe and langanke @xcite and showed that contributions from higher multipoles , such as spin dipole resonances ( sdr ) , could be important for the sn neutrino .",
    "the importance of higher multipole transitions is recently confirmed at the shell model ( sm ) calculation by suzuki _",
    "_ @xcite and also at the quasi - particle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) calculations by us @xcite .",
    "neutrino ( @xmath15 ) ( antineutrino ( @xmath19 ) ) energies and flux emitted from the core collapsing sn explosion are conjectured to be peaked from a few to tens of mev energy region @xcite . therefore ,",
    "the @xmath20-induced reactions on @xmath0ar are sensitive on the high - lying excited states of the nucleus beyond one nucleon thresholds .",
    "one more point to be noticed is that the reaction proceeds via two - step processes , _",
    "i.e. _ target nuclei are excited by incident @xmath21 and decayed to lower energy states with the emission of some particles @xcite .",
    "of course , the one - step process , which directly knocks out one nucleon from a target nucleus with outgoing lepton , might work on the abundances of final nuclei @xcite .",
    "in particular , the contribution could be comparable to that of the two - step process with the higher energy neutrino @xcite .",
    "but , in this work , we do not take account of the effects by the one - step process .",
    "the particle emission decay mode allows the daughter nuclei to easily proceed to adjacent nuclei and naturally influences the nuclear abundances in the universe .",
    "since we do not have experimental data about the emission decay mode enough to fix relevant transitions , one usually resorts to the statistical model such as hauser - feshbach theory @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we take the approach done by ref . @xcite",
    "of course , the preceding excitation occurs through various transitions , _",
    "i.e. _ super allowed fermi ( @xmath22 , allowed gamow teller ( gt ) ( @xmath23 , sdr ( @xmath24 , and other higher multipole transitions @xcite .",
    "since out results for the sn neutrinos are briefly reported @xcite , in this work , we present more detailed and advanced results based on the qrpa calculation for @xmath25-@xmath0ar reactions in the following two respects .",
    "the first point is that relevant cross sections for solar and sn neutrinos are calculated and compared simultaneously , whose energy ranges are considered up to 30 and 80 mev region , respectively @xcite .",
    "secondly , we focus on roles of high - lying excited states around 20 mev although they are not verified at the experiments .",
    "our results decrease the cross sections of @xmath0ar(@xmath11@xmath0k@xmath12 reaction about 3.5 times and increase about twice those of @xmath0ar(@xmath14@xmath0cl@xmath12 reaction compared to the previous calculations @xcite .",
    "consequently , the expected 12 times difference between the reactions at @xmath26 = 80 mev is reduced drastically to about twice difference .",
    "the gt strength recently deduced from @xmath0ar(p , n ) reactions @xcite , which is estimated to justify our calculations , is also reproduced in a satisfactory way .    in section ii ,",
    "our theoretical formalism is presented with the neutron - proton pairing correlations .",
    "results of various neutrino induced reactions on @xmath0ar are discussed at section iii .",
    "finally summaries and conclusion are given at section iv .",
    "since our qrpa formalism for neutrino - nucleus ( @xmath27 ) reactions is detailed at our previous papers @xcite , here we summarize two important characteristics compared to other qrpa approaches .",
    "first , the brueckner @xmath28 matrix is employed for two - body interactions inside nuclei by solving the following bethe - salpeter equation based on the bonn cd potential for nucleon - nucleon interactions in free space @xmath29 where @xmath30 indicate the single nucleon basis states characterized by oscillator type wave functions with single particle energies from the woods - saxon potential .",
    "@xmath31 is the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian and @xmath32 is the pauli operator .",
    "@xmath33 is the phenomenological nucleon - nucleon potential in free space .",
    "it may enable us to reduce some ambiguities from nucleon - nucleon interactions inside nuclei .",
    "second , we include neutron - proton ( np ) pairing as well as neutron - neutron ( nn ) and proton - proton ( pp ) pairing correlations . in medium or medium - heavy nuclei",
    ", the np pairing contributes to some extent for relevant transitions because of small energy gaps between proton and neutron energy spaces @xcite .",
    "moreover the np pairing leads to a unified description of both charged current ( cc ) and neutral current ( nc ) reactions within a framework as shown later on .",
    "but the contribution by the np pairing is shown to be only within 1 @xmath34 2 % for the weak interaction in @xmath5c , such as @xmath35 decay and the @xmath36c reaction @xcite , because the energy gap between neutron and proton energy spaces is too large in such a light nucleus to be effective .",
    "but in medium - heavy nuclei , such as @xmath6fe and @xmath6ni , the np pairing effect accounts for 20 @xmath34 30 % of total cross sections @xcite . results by our qrpa have successfully described relevant @xmath37reaction data for @xmath5c @xcite , @xmath6fe and @xmath6ni @xcite , and @xmath7la and @xmath8ta @xcite as well as @xmath38 , 2@xmath39 and @xmath40 decays @xcite .    for cc reactions ,",
    "the ground state of a target nucleus is described by the bcs vacua for the quasi - particle which comprises all types correlations .",
    "excited states , @xmath41 , in a compound nucleus are generated by operating the following one phonon operator to the initial nucleus @xmath42 ~,\\ ] ] where pair creation operator @xmath43 is defined as @xmath44 with a quasi - particle creation operator @xmath45 and clebsh - gordan coefficient @xmath46 . here",
    "roman letters indicate single particle states , and greek letters with a prime mean quasi - particle types 1 or 2 .",
    "if neutron - proton pairing is neglected , the phonon operator is easily decoupled to two phonon operators , charge changing and conserving reactions , as used in the usual proton - neutron qrpa ( pnqrpa ) @xcite .",

    "are also easily reduced to the result by the pnqrpa @xcite    the weak current operators , @xmath58 , composed of longitudinal , coulomb , electric and magnetic operators , are detailed at ref .",
    "@xcite . finally , based on initial and final nuclear states , cross section for @xmath25 reactions through the weak transition operator is given as @xcite & & ( d _ ) _ ( / | ) = g_f^2 k   , where @xmath59 means the case of @xmath25 , respectively . @xmath60 and @xmath61 are incident and final lepton 3-momenta , @xmath62 and @xmath63 with the final lepton s energy @xmath64 .    for cc reactions we multiplied cabbibo angle @xmath65 and considered the coulomb distortion of outgoing leptons in a residual nucleus @xcite .",
    "by following the prescriptions on refs.@xcite , we choose an energy point in which both approaches predict same values .",
    "then we use the fermi function below the energy and the effective momentum approach ( ema ) above the energy .",
    "our qrpa includes not only proton - proton and neutron - neutron pairing but also neutron - proton ( np ) pairing correlations .",
    "the np pairing is included at the bcs stage to reproduce empirical np pairing gaps by adjusting a renormalized strength parameter @xmath66 embedded in the brueckner g matrix in the following theoretical pairing gap @xcite @xmath67,\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is total ground state energy with ( without ) np pairing and @xmath69 is a sum of the lowest two quasi - particles energies with ( without ) np pairing correlations .",
    "more detailed procedures for the inclusion of the np pairing correlations are presented at refs .",
    "0.5 cm      in fig.1 , we show results for cc reactions , @xmath0ar(@xmath70@xmath0k@xmath12 for solar and sn neutrinos . for solar neutrinos ( upper part )",
    ", cross sections are fully ascribed to the the gt and fermi transitions .",
    "other transitions contribute only a few % to the cross section below 30 mev region .",
    "since the maximum energy of the solar neutrino from @xmath1b is believed to be 12 mev , solar neutrino reactions are dominated by the gt and fermi transitions .",
    "these results justify previous sm calculations for solar neutrino reactions on @xmath0ar @xcite , which consider only the gt and fermi transitions .",
    "the phenomenological approach @xmath71 used at ref .",
    "@xcite is approximately good on the energy region above 20 mev , but @xmath72 is much better below 20 mev region .",
    "but for sn neutrinos ( lower part ) , contributions from the spin dipole resonance ( sdr ) ( @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) are increased to those by the fermi transition around 55 mev and becomes larger about 2 @xmath34 2.5 times of the fermi transition beyond the region .",
    "other higher multipole transitions , ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) contribute 10 % maximally . of course , both gt and fermi transitions are still main components .",
    "for example , their contributions are 70 @xmath34 80 % around 50 mev region , and 60 @xmath34 50 % above 50 mev region . these phenomena , the dominance of the gt and fermi transitions , are typical of cc reactions on even - even nuclei , for example , @xmath5c , @xmath6fe and @xmath6ni @xcite .",
    "our cross sections in fig . 1 are smaller on the whole energy region about 3.5 times rather than previous rpa calculations @xcite . in the following the characteristics of both approaches",
    "are explained with the reason why we predict such small cross sections .",
    "we include excited states of @xmath0k@xmath12 up to a few tens of mev , which are generated by the phonon operator in eq.(2 ) , while the rpa calculation @xcite seems to take only a few excited states known in the experiment .",
    "but the high - lying excited states affect phase space in eq .",
    "( 6 ) through the energy conservation , @xmath77 , with the outgoing lepton energy @xmath64 , the incident neutrino energy @xmath26 and the energy transfer @xmath78 .",
    "energy transfer to the target nucleus @xmath78 , which just corresponds to the excited energy , makes the energy of outgoing electrons @xmath64 in eq .",
    "( 6 ) smaller than that of incident neutrino energy .",
    "it leads to the smaller cross sections because the increase rate of transition strengths can not follow the decrease of the phase space .",
    "if we take the few known states , the cross sections are easily increased to match well with the rpa calculation simply because of the increase of the outgoing lepton energy in eq.(6 ) .",
    "excited states beyond the known states decrease cross sections even for the solar neutrino case .",
    "recent calculation of @xmath0ar(@xmath79 ) by the local density approximation shows also such a tendency because it does not also include discrete states explicitly @xcite",
    ". 0.5 cm      in fig .",
    "2 , we show the gt(@xmath80 ) strength distributions and their running sums , whose excitations energies are with respect to the ground state of @xmath0ar .",
    "the higher energy states we go to , the larger strength and their running sums are obtained . in specific , discrete energy states on the 10 @xmath34 20 mev region",
    "affect significantly the neutrino reaction .",
    "even for solar neutrinos , these energy states reduce cross sections compared to those calculated by a few known states .    very recently",
    ", the gt strength up to 8 mev are extracted from @xmath0ar(p , n ) reactions @xcite .",
    "consistency of our results with the experimental gt( ) strength can be shown by studying the strength distribution and its running sum in the lower energy states at fig.2 .",
    "the gt strength of ours are localized at 3.6 , 3.7 , 8.6 and 8.9 mev from the @xmath0ar ground state , which corresponds to 2.1 , 2.2 , 7.1 and 7.4 mev from the @xmath0k ground state .",
    "they are consistent with the data by the @xmath0ar(p , n ) reaction @xcite , apart from their strength , although some minor states between 2 and 7 mev energy region are not verified in detail in our calculations . but its running sum up to 7.5 mev from @xmath0k ground state , whose value is @xmath815 , is nicely reproduced in our approach by multiplying the @xmath82 to our results @xmath83 3.6 .",
    "the gt strength derived by our qrpa is thought to be reliable enough to justify our conjecture on the role of higher excited states .    based on the gt and fermi strength distributions , bhattacharya _ et al . _",
    "@xcite deduced @xmath2 reactions on @xmath0ar up to 30 mev in the following way @xmath84~,\\ ] ] where @xmath85 and @xmath86 refer to the momentum and total energy of the outgoing electron and @xmath87 accounts for the coulomb correction .",
    "they are shown to be consistent with those by the @xmath38 decay on the mirror nucleus , @xmath0ti @xcite .",
    "the neutrino cross sections of @xmath0ar(@xmath88 ) obtained by eq.(8 ) were very similar to the previous results calculated by a few experimental excited states @xcite around a few mev region .",
    "for example , the cross section around 30 mev region is about @xmath89 , which is about 3 times larger than our prediction at fig.1 .",
    "since the excited states newly verified in the @xmath0ar(p , n ) reaction are also located on the energy region below 10 mev , deduced cross sections are rarely affected by the new gt strength data .",
    "it should be noted that eq .",
    "( 8) is valid only near threshold of the outgoing electron as commented at ref .",
    "for example , one can obtain very easily eq .",
    "( 8) from eq .",
    "( 6 ) , which is exact form for the cross section , by putting the 3-momentum of the outgoing electron @xmath90 = 0 and considering only j = 0 and 1 for the fermi and the gt transitions , respectively .",
    "therefore , eq . ( 8) can not be applied for the incident neutrino energy beyond the electron threshold considered in this report .",
    "0.5 cm      this reduction of cross sections by the higher excited states should function on the @xmath4 reaction , @xmath0ar(@xmath91@xmath0cl@xmath12 .",
    "3 shows results for @xmath0ar(@xmath13@xmath0cl@xmath12 via cc for solar and sn neutrinos .",
    "general trends of the gt , fermi and sdr transitions are very similar to the results of @xmath0ar(@xmath92@xmath0k@xmath12 . for solar neutrinos ,",
    "the gt and fermi transitions are main components , but the sdr ( @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) contributions emerge largely for the sne neutrinos .",
    "cross sections for solar @xmath4 are almost same as the those by the @xmath2 reaction , @xmath0ar(@xmath95@xmath0k@xmath12 , while they are about a half of those by the @xmath2 reaction for sn neutrinos .",
    "this is contrast to the results of refs .",
    "@xcite . actually , they addressed about 12 times difference between the @xmath2 and @xmath4 reactions in the cross section at @xmath26 = 80 mev . since the q value for the @xmath4 reaction , 7.48 mev , decreases the incident neutrino energy by the q value , _",
    "i.e. _ as @xmath96 , the reaction is disfavored by the low energy neutrino .",
    "consequently , it may play a role of reducing the @xmath4 cross section for a given energy .",
    "the strong reduction of cross sections for the @xmath4 reaction by the large q value was one of the motivation to distinguish the @xmath2 and @xmath4 reactions on @xmath0ar target .    however , the high - lying excited states weaken the decrease of cross sections by the q value , so that the expected large decrease of cross sections by the q value is not so drastic compared to those by a few known excited states . as a result ,",
    "our cross sections by @xmath4 are about twice larger than those of refs . @xcite .",
    "since the cross sections by @xmath2 become smaller about 3.5 times than those by previous calculations , total difference between the @xmath2 and @xmath4 reactions turns out to be only 2 @xmath34 3 times difference .",

    "actually , the difference between @xmath4-a and @xmath98-a reactions is given by the last term in eq.(6 ) , the interference term of magnetic and electric transitions .",

    "<S> neutrino reactions on @xmath0ar via charged and neutral currents for detecting solar and core collapsing supernovae ( sne ) neutrinos and the gamow teller strength are calculated by considering the high - lying excited states up to a few tens of mev region . </S>",
    "<S> the nucleus was originally exploited to identify the solar neutrino emitted from @xmath1b produced in the pp - chains on the sun . with the higher energy neutrinos emitted from the core collapsing sne , contributions from higher multi - pole transitions including the spin dipole resonances ( sdr ) as well as the gamow teller ( gt ) and fermi transitions are shown to be important ingredients for understanding reactions induced by the sne as well as solar neutrinos . in this work , we focused on the role of high - lying excited states which are located beyond a few low - lying states known in the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> expected large difference between the cross sections of @xmath2 and @xmath3 reactions on @xmath0ar , which difference has been anticipated in previous calculations because of the large q value in the @xmath4 reaction , is significantly diminished . </S>",
    "<S> the reduction leads only to about 2 times difference between them . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations are carried out by the quasi - particle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) , which takes account of the neutron - proton pairing as well as proton - proton and neutron - neutron pairing correlations . </S>",
    "<S> they were successfully applied in the description of the nuclear beta decay and relevant neutrino reaction data on @xmath5c and @xmath6fe , and the gt data on the @xmath7la and @xmath8ta . </S>"
