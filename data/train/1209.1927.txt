    "in many biological , social and economic systems , there exists a continuous interplay between individual actions and collective dynamics  @xcite .",
    "this interplay becomes particularly significant when the individual decisions on how to contribute to a public resource determine in the end the sustainability of the whole .",
    "the choice of contributing that implies personal costs favors community growth but also promotes the appearance of _ free - riders_. these agents take advantage of the public good ( pg ) , spread in the population and eventually bring its collapse  @xcite .",
    "this predicted scenario does not correspond however with many observations .",
    "stable communities whose growth is based on pgs are indeed observed at all scales ; from microbial aggregates , e.g. , biofilms depending on the individual contribution of extracellular substances , e.g. ,  @xcite , to human commons , e.g. , fisheries , forests , etc ( note that in some of these cases the choice is not so much to contribute but to make appropriate use of a shared resource )  @xcite .",
    "these findings triggered the interest on understanding the type of behavioral strategies that could be adopted by individuals to help avoid collapse and how such outcome could further depend on specific structural features characterizing the community .",
    "notably , the adoption of simple strategies appears to be efficient enough to promote sustainability  @xcite .",
    "simple rules contrast the idea of elaborated behaviors that allow individuals to optimally maximize benefits , a null model particularly extended in studies of human commons . in this context , the relevance of elementary strategies ( or heuristics ) was first investigated by herbert simon that also pioneered the essential connection between heuristics and the particular environment where they are to be applied  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) . in a broader perspective , heuristics  sometimes interpreted as behavioral `` limitations''",
    "can then represent effective strategies to deal with complex ecological constraints a consideration that applies to bacterial , animal and human decision - making circumstances  @xcite .    in this manuscript",
    ", we examine how simple strategies , that exhibit limited information processing , can nevertheless be adjusted to exploit certain environmental constraints to attain sustainable growth .",
    "we model the commons by means of a stylized ecological public - good model in which a population of agents is organized in groups ( where they are involved in a public - good game ) and the supply of pg determines population density  @xcite ( fig .",
    "s1 ) . core structural factors characterizing the `` community ''",
    "can also be modified in the model , such as group size @xmath0 or resource characteristics , i.e. , pg efficiency , @xmath1 .",
    "we additionally consider three types of individual strategies of increasing sophistication ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "first , we examine the validity of the simplest one , i.e. , permanent production of pg .",
    "we find that this strategy works when pg creation efficiently induces growth and the commons is structured in relatively small groups .",
    "then , we assume a strategy that stochastically alternates between contribution and non - contribution . this rule , as simple as it is , enlarges the range of commons where its adoption leads to sustainability ( as compared to the previous case ) .",
    "finally , we introduce a heuristic in which a simple sensing mechanism is at work .",
    "this sensing allows individuals to condition their contribution on the composition of their last interaction group , i.e. , it involves some degree of behavioral plasticity .",
    "we discover two opposite plastic heuristics to be efficient in two contrasting environmental situations . while _ positive _ plasticity ( contribute only when most individuals in the group are contributing ) works for low efficiency and small groups , _ negative _ plasticity ( contribute merely when it is strictly necessary ) does it for high efficiency and large groups .",
    "we first examined the consequences of the simplest possible strategy : permanent and indiscriminate production of pg .",
    "this strategy maximizes growth but additionally favors the emergence of cheaters ( that arise by mutation from an all@xmath2 population ) .",
    "cheaters rapidly invade a resident population but also cause its decline , because of the coupled decay in pg ( less @xmath2s ) that limits growth ( fig .",
    "2@xmath3 ) .",
    "the population cascade associated to cheater expansion can unexpectedly direct to its recovery .",
    "this is linked to the group structure of the interactions in the commons .",
    "sufficiently small density causes the appearance of groups primarily composed of only @xmath2s or only cheaters ( figs .",
    "2@xmath3-@xmath4 ) that multiplies the replication of constitutive @xmath2 and reduces that of cheaters , both processes contributing to the recovery of the population ( when enough inter - group composition variance is generated , in what is known as the simpson s paradox  @xcite , see also supplement ) .",
    "this recovery dynamics includes however an added risk , since the low density could precipitate population extinction by stochastic demographic effects  @xcite , figs .",
    "2@xmath3 and 2@xmath5 .",
    "risk is raised when the population repeatedly exhibits _ critical cascades _",
    ", i.e. , declines in density below a particular minimal value . the final outcome between recovery and extinction",
    "is strongly determined by the intrinsic properties of the commons .",
    "constitutive production reveals in this way as a successful strategy when the pg efficiently determines growth ( @xmath1 sufficiently high , figs .",
    "2@xmath6-@xmath7 ) or when groups within the commons are relatively small ( controlling for @xmath1 , fig .",
    "s2 ) .",
    "we analyzed a second strategy in which individuals choose randomly whether to contribute or not to the pg ( i.e. , they can sometimes decide to free ride ) .",
    "specifically , agents present a @xmath8 state with probability @xmath9 ( or , conversely , an @xmath2 state with 1-@xmath9 , see fig",
    ".  1 ) . therefore , stochastic producers are totally unable to sense the composition of their interaction group ( the amount of available pg ) .",
    "a homogeneous population of stochastic producers generates a constant sub - population of @xmath8s that decreases pg levels with two consequences .",
    "it can reduce the chances of cheaters to replicate ( which favors sustainability ) but also drive the system to extinction even without any cheater present by cause of a severe pg reduction .",
    "we quantified this trade - off by computing the number of critical cascades , as before , and their duration ( i.e. , number of consecutive steps below the minimal density threshold ) .",
    "increasing @xmath9 reduces the number of critical cascades but also increases steadily cascade duration ( that reflects the delay in the appearance of all@xmath2 groups associated to population recovery ) .",
    "this trade - off indicates an optimal @xmath9 that minimizes the frequency of extinctions and defines the exact stochastic rate for a successful strategy ( figs .",
    "3.@xmath3-@xmath4 ) .",
    "when agents follow this optimal stochastic heuristic , cheater replication is limited event for high densities ( generally below 50@xmath10 , figs .",
    "3@xmath5-@xmath6 ) , population oscillations are damped , and extinction risks reduced .",
    "this dynamics contrasts with the constitutive heuristics scenario in which cheater replication can reach very high values in dense populations ( fig .",
    "sustainability is thus attained in a wider range of commons ( in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath0 ) when agents followed a stochastic strategy . however , this range is still limited . a relative decrease in @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "s4 ) or an increase in @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "s5 ) implies once more an increment in the number of critical cascades and in this way of extinctions .",
    "alternative strategies are required in those commons .      to analyze if the addition of some basic information - processing features could direct to more effective heuristics ( in commons where growth is unsustainable with the use of constitutive or stochastic production ) we examined a third strategy that includes a simple sensing mechanism .",
    "this sensing permits agents evaluate the relative abundance of @xmath2s in the group where they most recently played the game ( this can be estimated by means of the amount of pg received ) .    if the pg obtained in the previous interaction is above ( below ) a particular threshold @xmath11 , individuals exhibit the @xmath8 phenotype with probability @xmath9 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "this defines a general plastic producer , see fig .  1",
    ". we studied then the dynamics of a population of individuals exhibiting different plastic heuristics ( distinct @xmath9 , @xmath12 , @xmath11 ) in a range of commons ( characterized by @xmath1 and @xmath0 ) . by scanning the diverse heuristic / commons conditions",
    ", we were able to identify two specific plastic heuristics that leads to sustainable growth in wider range of commons .",
    "the most valuable heuristic in commons characterized by small groups and low pg efficiency @xmath1 consists on contributing to pg only if most members of the agent s recent interaction group were also contributing .",
    "individuals that follow this heuristic ( positive plastic producers ) immediately react to the presence of @xmath8 ( or cheaters ) in their past interaction , becoming @xmath8 themselves ( formally , they present a small @xmath9 , but a large @xmath12 and @xmath11 , see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the appearance of cheaters in a population of positive plastic producers ( in state @xmath2 ) originates consequently an immediate decrease of pg in each group which triggers the remaining @xmath2s to stop contributing and switch to @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "4@xmath3 ) .    as population declines , the number of groups exclusively formed by the residual plastic individuals in the @xmath2 state increase ( shading in figs .",
    "4@xmath3-@xmath4 ) .",
    "this situation drives the system to the `` recovery regime '' where inter - group variance makes the simpson s paradox decisive once more ( fig .",
    "4@xmath6 ) .",
    "note that this recovery dynamics , characteristic of the structure of commons , is enhanced by the heuristic at work : @xmath2 individuals that experienced groups of only @xmath2s keep contributing with high probability .",
    "the whole process stops the creation of @xmath8s , expels cheaters and takes the population back to an all@xmath2 regime , an absorbing state of the system ( fig .",
    "4.@xmath4 ) .",
    "once the population is uniquely constituted by @xmath2s , it remains in this homogeneous state until new cheaters arise .    if groups are relatively large , the mechanisms just described fail . while the reaction to cheater invasion is similar ,",
    "the enrichment of all@xmath2 groups is delayed .",
    "only when the population level becomes very low , these groups start to arise but , as we discussed earlier , this regime increases the chance of demographic extinctions .",
    "these collapses are not totally avoided in commons displaying higher @xmath1 . in these cases ,",
    "large group size @xmath0 and large efficiency @xmath1 , we identified an alternative plastic heuristic that can assist sustainable growth .",
    "individuals following a minimal - effort ( plastic ) heuristic are the ones that most strongly bring sustainability in commons structured in large groups , and where the supply of pg efficiently determines growth .",
    "these negative plastic producers present a @xmath8 state unless the amount of pg in their latter interaction group is below a minimal threshold that could in the end impede growth ( formally , they exhibit a large @xmath9 , but small @xmath12 and @xmath11 , see fig .  1 ) .",
    "thus , a population constituted by negative plastic producers is constantly at low density , independently of the presence of cheaters .",
    "the low - density regime is maintained as a dynamical equilibrium in which an excess of @xmath2s makes individuals to become @xmath8 , since many @xmath2s are observed in each group , while the successive lack of pg ( and of @xmath2s in the groups ) is compensated by showing again the @xmath2 state . in this scenario , the emergence of cheaters by mutation is indirectly controlled by the high abundance of @xmath8 already in the resident population , which reduces in turn cheater presence and chance of invasion ( fig .",
    "4@xmath5 ) .    as negative",
    "plasticity strongly relies on the abundance ( by default ) of @xmath8 agents , this heuristic requires that the pg produced by those that contribute must transform very efficiently into growth .",
    "for this reason , negative plasticity is successful only when @xmath1 is above a certain minimal value .",
    "note also that , as compared to a population of positive plastic producers , the mechanisms of recovery do not rely so much on the temporal increase of inter - group variance ( that brings the `` recovery regime '' ) but on the presence of a relatively constant and adequate inter - group diversity ( fig .",
    "4@xmath6 ) .",
    "communities whose growth depends on a pg contributed by their members present a fundamental instability associated to the emergence of free - riders ( cheaters ) that do not contribute but use the accessible pg .",
    "this instability at its core a problem of maintenance of cooperation produces direct ecological consequences , i.e. , the collapse of the population .",
    "this ecological scenario immediately defines a characteristic  environment \" in which individuals following simple strategies are to  solve \" a precise task : attaining the sustainable growth of the collective .",
    "we analyzed this situation by considering limitations upon the decision - making capacities ( fig .  1 ) and also modifications of the specific attributes of the environment ( @xmath1 and @xmath0 ) where decisions are taken  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the simplest heuristic , constitutive production of pg , reveals the core ecological dynamics ( fig .",
    "2@xmath3 )  @xcite . by avoiding production costs",
    ", cheaters can spread in a population of ( constitutive ) @xmath2s consequently reducing population density due to pg depletion .",
    "the resultant low densities induce the formation of between - group differences ( groups dominantly constituted by @xmath2s or cheaters , figs .",
    "2@xmath4-@xmath5 ) .",
    "this high inter - group variance causes individuals in groups dominantly composed by @xmath2s to receive larger payoffs , i.e. , present higher replication rates .",
    "differential growth leads to population recovery , as @xmath2 agents are the ones strongly contributing to the next generations ( simpson s paradox  @xcite , fig .",
    "2@xmath3-@xmath4 ) .",
    "low densities help then to promote @xmath2s ( i.e. , cooperation ) in such structured populations .",
    "low densities originate a complementary ecological effect , when populations undergo demographic extinctions  @xcite instead of recovery .",
    "we captured these processes by quantifying the number of critical cascades the number of times that the population is below a minimal density threshold . a decrease in @xmath1 or",
    "an increase of @xmath0 increases the number of critical cascades and the frequency of extinctions if pg is constitutively generated ( fig .",
    "2@xmath6 and fig .",
    "@xmath13 ) . hence",
    ", permanent production of pg does not always drive sustainable growth .",
    "we introduced two additional heuristics .",
    "the simplest one , in which no external information is processed , consists in switching stochastically between contribution and non - contribution , i.e. , individuals decide randomly to free - ride .",
    "this behaviour ( defined by an opportune optimal switching rate , fig .",
    "3@xmath3-@xmath4 ) is generally more effective than constitutive production , but fails again when @xmath1 becomes smaller or @xmath0 larger ( figs .",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 ) .",
    "the third heuristic is based on conditional contribution .",
    "we implement this by means of a simple sensing mechanism that allows individuals to estimate the composition of their recent interaction group and alter their behaviour accordingly . modifying the two key structural attributes of the commons",
    "let us identify two contrasting conditional strategies",
    ".    for low @xmath1 ( and sufficiently small group size @xmath0 ) positive plasticity is the most convenient strategy ( fig .",
    "5@xmath3 ) .",
    "this is related to its highly reactive response to cheaters .",
    "in fact , positive plastic producers stop producing pg when few cheaters ( or few @xmath8s ) are detected in their earlier interaction group .",
    "this response immediately directs to minimal densities ( fig .",
    "4@xmath3 ) and a successive strong recovery to the population carrying capacity ( fig .",
    "4@xmath4 ) .",
    "interestingly , the reaction to cheaters invasions ( consisting in the rapid increase of @xmath8s ) is promptly interrupted as result of the feedback between the threshold - like decision and group assortment of @xmath2s ( created by the combination of low density and small group size , fig .",
    "4@xmath3 ) .",
    "this example emphasizes how heuristics associated to limited information processing ( the limitation corresponds in this case to the inability of individuals to distinguish the presence of cheaters from that of plastic producers in the @xmath8 state ) are still efficient due to the specific ecological structure where they are applied  @xcite .",
    "positive plasticity does not work when the commons is structured in large groups . in this case , negative plasticity emerges comparatively as a better strategy ( fig .",
    "5@xmath4 ) .",
    "this minimal effort behavior  @xcite maintains the population in a dynamical equilibrium with the largest possible frequency of @xmath8s that minimizes cheaters advantage but is compatible with population growth .",
    "negative plasticity is in this sense an advanced version of stochastic production with the individual ability to switch back to a @xmath2 state when population density reaches critical values .",
    "thus , the use of different decision - making strategies clearly causes divergent sustainability outcomes when controlling for community structure ( i.e , when both @xmath0 and @xmath1 is fixed , fig .  5 ) .",
    "one could further ask if these strategies are observed in natural scenarios ( characterized by a pg dilemma ) .",
    "we suggest that this is the case .",
    "indeed , phenotypic noise , similar to the stochastic production strategy , is present in many bacterial communities , as a broad form of bet hedging  @xcite or in the stochastic expression of virulence factors , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "moreover , production of pgs such as extracellular polymeric substances fundamental for biofilm communities is activated / terminated at high cell densities  @xcite ; expression of bacteriocins is reduced when the population density is low by a quorum - sensing system  @xcite ; generation of iron - scavenging pyoverdin molecules iron being an essential public good in some environments is reduced when enough molecules are already present minimizing the ability of cheaters to invade  @xcite . in a different scale ,",
    "that of human commons , various forms of conditional cooperation were also observed , with a variable degree of individual investment linked to group size  @xcite ( predicting minimal collaborative efforts in collective action as group size increases  @xcite , reminiscent of our results on negative plasticity ; see also the `` hump shaped '' strategies in  @xcite ) .    that all the situations above correspond to very separate scenarios",
    "indicates that these heuristics could be fundamental `` building blocks ''  @xcite in the assembly of this type of social arenas and , more broadly , in the maintenance of cooperation in structured populations ( see supplement for an extended discussion ) .",
    "overall , these findings stress that , beyond the importance of structural factors , like pg efficiency and group structure , the sustainability of the commons should be understood as the appropriate integration of ecological dynamics and individual information - processing abilities .",
    "public good games are used to model social dilemmas in which the optimal behavior of the individual conflicts with the best outcome of the collective  @xcite . the simplest of these models is the one - shot public good game ( also termed @xmath0-person prisoner s dilemma  @xcite ) .",
    "this game is played by agents that can contribute ( cooperators or producers , @xmath2 ) or not ( defectors or non - producers , @xmath8 ) to the pg in groups of size @xmath0 .",
    "contributing implies a cost @xmath16 to the agents .",
    "after the game , all contributions are summed , multiplied by an efficiency , or reward , factor @xmath1 ( that determines the efficiency of the investments and the attractiveness of the pg ) and redistributed to all individuals within the group , irrespectively of their contribution .",
    "thus , if there are @xmath17 cooperators among the @xmath0 participants , the payoff for a defector is @xmath18 while the payoff for a cooperator is @xmath18 - @xmath16 .",
    "we used an agent - based computational model characterized by two distinct _ stages _ ( fig .",
    "s1 ) . in stage @xmath19 ,",
    "the population is structured in evenly - sized randomly formed groups in which the pg game is played . in stage @xmath20 , after groups disappear , each individual chooses its successive phenotype ( and then replicates ) according to the group composition ( and payoff ) experienced in stage @xmath19 .",
    "this model extends the original hamilton s group selection model  @xcite to one in which individuals are able to dynamically change their phenotype according to previous experience .",
    "note that the pg game is specifically characterized by the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath16 ( group size , efficiency and cost of the pg , respectively ) .",
    "we fix @xmath16=@xmath21 and @xmath1@xmath22@xmath0 ( this second condition defines producers / cooperators as strong altruists  @xcite ) and also the conditions of the initial population ( constituted by a common pool of @xmath23 identical plastic agents in the @xmath2 state ; @xmath23 is thus the maximal population size ) .",
    "the system is updated in a _ sequential _ way as follows ( supplement for further details ) : * 1 . *",
    "the common pool is divided in randomly formed groups of size @xmath0 ( groups may contain individuals and empty spaces ) . * 2 .",
    "* in each one of the ( non - empty ) groups , a one - shot pg game is played .",
    "agents in the @xmath8 state and cheaters receive the payoff p@xmath24 , while agents in the @xmath2 state receive the same payoff minus a cost , i.e. , p@xmath25p@xmath26 ; with @xmath27 being the number of @xmath2s , @xmath8s and cheaters in the group , respectively , and @xmath28 . after the interaction the grouping of individuals",
    "is dissolved .",
    "each plastic agent adjusts its state according to the relative abundance of @xmath2s that experienced in the group where it played the game and the triplet ( @xmath29 ) as described in fig",
