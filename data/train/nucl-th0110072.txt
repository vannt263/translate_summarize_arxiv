    "the na50 interpretation of the data on @xmath0 suppression in @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath1 @xmath1 collisions is as follows @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and peripheral @xmath1 @xmath1 data ( up to @xmath5  gev ) , are well described with nuclear absorption alone with an absorptive cross - section @xmath6  mb . at @xmath7  gev",
    "there is a sudden onset of anomalous suppression .",
    "a second accident occurs at @xmath8  gev , close to the knee of the @xmath9 distribution , where a change of curvature in the shape of the suppression is observed  followed by a steep fall - off .",
    "however , at variance with this view , the most peripheral point in @xmath1 @xmath1 has consistently lied above the na50 nuclear absorption curve  which extrapolates @xmath2 and @xmath3 data .",
    "this tendency is now confirmed by the preliminary data on the @xmath0 suppression versus the energy , @xmath10 , of the zero degree calorimeter . here",
    "several peripheral points lie above the na50 nuclear absorption curve and , more important , they exhibit a steeper suppression pattern .",
    "it is , therefore , important to study these data and to compare them with the results of deconfining and comover interactions models .",
    "this comparison is also of interest in the large @xmath9 region .",
    "indeed , the na50 data for @xmath1 @xmath1 collisions at large @xmath9 can be described either in a deconfining model @xcite or as a result of the interaction with comovers @xcite .",
    "our purpose here is to confront with each other the results of two specific models , namely a deconfining @xcite and a comovers interaction @xcite model  and to compare them with experiment . in the first model @xcite , one requires either two sharp thresholds , as in @xcite , or a single threshold smoothed with an arbitrary function .",
    "both in this model and in the comovers one @xcite , it is necessary to introduce the fluctuations in @xmath9 @xcite in order to reproduce the fall - off of the data at large @xmath9 ( beyond the `` knee '' of the @xmath9 distribution ) .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the effect of the @xmath9 fluctuations is significantly larger in the deconfining scenario than in the comovers approach .",
    "this leads to agreement with the large @xmath9 data in the first case  while the fall - off obtained in the comovers approach is too weak @xcite .",
    "however , all data beyond the knee have been obtained in the so - called minimum bias ( @xmath11 ) analysis , where only the ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath11 cross - sections is measured and it is divided by a theoretical ratio of @xmath12 to @xmath11 cross - sections , i.e.    [ 1e ] .",
    "r_mb = ( j / dy ) _ mb = ( j / mb ) _ exper./ ( dy mb)_th .    in the theoretical model used by the na50 collaboration @xcite , the ratio @xmath13 saturates at large @xmath9 . in contrast , it has been argued in @xcite that this ratio also falls at large @xmath9 .",
    "this is due to the shift in @xmath9 between the @xmath12 and @xmath11 event samples , resulting from the @xmath9 taken by the dimuon .",
    "this shift is very small ( of the order of a few per mil ) and , therefore , has no visible effect up to the knee of the @xmath9 distribution  where this distribution is rather flat .",
    "however , it does have a sizeable effect in the tail , due to the very steep fall - off of the distribution .",
    "actually , experimental data on the ratio @xmath14 are available @xcite . they do show a fall - off at large @xmath9 , but the statistical errors are large .",
    "obviously , the same effect should be present in the ratio @xmath0 over @xmath11 and would cancel out in the true ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath12 cross - sections ",
    "i.e. the one obtained in the so - called standard analysis .",
    "however , it does not cancel in @xmath15 because this effect is not included in the theoretical model for the last factor in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ 1e ] ) , used by the na50 collaboration @xcite .",
    "when this effect , as estimated in @xcite , is taken into account , the comovers approach does describe the data for @xmath15 , whereas , in the deconfining model @xcite , the fall - off beyond the knee is too strong .",
    "this is shown in fig .  1 where the dashed lines are the results in the comovers model @xcite with and without @xmath16 loss .",
    "the upper solid line is the result obtained in the deconfining model @xcite . in this model one",
    "calculates the true ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath12 differential cross - sections  not @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , this line should be compared with the results in the standard analysis . to compare with the data in fig .",
    "1 , which where obtained with the @xmath11 analysis , one should take into account the @xmath16 loss . incorporating this effect , following the prescription @xcite ,",
    "one obtains the lower full curve in fig .  1 .",
    "clearly , a good way to avoid this problem is to measure @xmath15 as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "indeed , the main contribution to @xmath10 is due to the energy of the spectator nucleons  which is not affected by the presence or absence of the dimuon trigger .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we derive the @xmath16 - @xmath10 correlation .",
    "it turns out that this correlation allows to relate to each other the @xmath11 experimental distributions in the two variables  @xmath16 and @xmath10 . in section 3",
    "we compute the @xmath0 suppression versus @xmath10 and compare it with the one measured in @xmath16 , and with the results of the deconfining model @xcite . in section 4 ,",
    "we compute the @xmath0 suppression in @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the comovers approach and compare the normalization in these systems with the one in @xmath17 . the scenario for @xmath0 suppression resulting from the comovers model",
    "is described in the conclusions and confronted with the deconfining one .",
    "in the models @xcite , @xcite , one determines the @xmath0 suppression as a function of the impact parameter , @xmath20 .",
    "however , @xmath20 is not measurable and the na50 collaboration uses , as a measure of centrality , either @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "it is , therefore , necessary to determine both quantities as a function of @xmath20 . since @xmath9 is proportional to the multiplicity , the relation between @xmath9 and @xmath20 results from the determination of the multiplicity at each @xmath20 in the rapidity region of the @xmath9 calorimeter . in the comovers model @xcite this is done @xcite in the dual parton model ( dpm ) .",
    "more precisely , we put  :    [ 2e ] e_t(b ) = 1 2  q  n_yca^co(b ) .    here",
    "@xmath21 is the charged multiplicity in the rapidity region of the @xmath9 calorimeter .",
    "the factor @xmath22 is introduced because only the energy of neutrals is measured by the calorimeter .",
    "thus the coefficient @xmath23 is close to the average energy per particle .",
    "however , the difference between multiplicities of positive negatives and neutrals as well as the efficiency of the @xmath9 calorimeter do affect the value of @xmath23 .",
    "this value can be determined from the position of the `` knee '' of the @xmath9 distribution of @xmath11 events measured by the na50 collaboration .",
    "we obtain @xmath24  gev @xcite ( see below ) .",
    "the energy of the zero degree calorimeter is given by    [ 3e ] e_zdc(b ) = [ a - n_a(b ) ] e_in +  n_a(b ) e_in .",
    "here @xmath25 is the number of spectator nucleons of @xmath26 and @xmath27  gev is the beam energy . while the first term in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ 3e ] ) gives the bulk of @xmath10 , the latter corresponds to the contamination by secondaries emitted very forward @xcite ",
    "assumed to be proportional to the number of participants , @xmath28 . here",
    "also the value of @xmath29 can be precisely determined from the position of the `` knee '' of the @xmath10 distribution of the @xmath11 event sample measured by na50 @xcite .",
    "we obtain @xmath30 .",
    "( [ 2e ] ) and ( [ 3e ] ) give the relation between @xmath20 and @xmath9 and @xmath20 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "these relations refer to average values and do not contain any information about the tails of the @xmath9 or @xmath10 distributions .",
    "( [ 2e ] ) and ( [ 3e ] ) also lead to a correlation between ( average values of ) @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this correlation is shown in fig .  2 , and gives a good description of the experimental one @xcite .",
    "we see from fig .  2 that the @xmath31 correlation is close to a straight line in eq .",
    "( ) is practically proportional to @xmath28 ( see fig .  1 of ) . ] and therefore can be accurately extrapolated beyond the knee of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 distributions .",
    "it turns out that this extrapolation describes the data quite well is essentially due to a fluctuation in @xmath32  which , in turn , produces a corresponding fluctuation in @xmath10 , via eq .",
    "let us discuss this point in detail .",
    "it is well known that the correlation @xmath33 can be described by a gaussian  :    [ 4e ] p(e_t , b ) = 1    with @xmath24  gev and @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the resulting @xmath11 distribution is indistinguishable from the solid line of @xcite ( 1998 data ) .",
    "the @xmath11 distribution of the 1996 data @xcite is reproduced with @xmath24 gev and @xmath35 @xcite distribution .",
    "this is due to the fact that the product @xmath36 , which , according to eq .",
    "( [ 4e ] ) , determines the width of the distribution , is very similar in the two cases . as for the difference in the values of @xmath23 it is just due to its definition , which is different in the two approaches ( eq . ( [ 2e ] ) , in our case ) . ] .    applying the @xmath31 correlation resulting from eqs .",
    "( [ 2e ] ) and ( [ 3e ] ) we obtain the @xmath10 distribution of @xmath11 events shown in figs .  3 .",
    "we see that the na50 data are well described , not only up to the knee , but also in the tail of the distribution .",
    "the turn - over in the data at large @xmath10 is due to the fact that they have not been corrected for efficiency .",
    "the comparison of figs .",
    "3a and 3b is quite instructive . in fig .",
    "3a it seems that the calculated curve has too much curvature and overshoots the data at small @xmath10 .",
    "however , this is no longer the case in fig .",
    ", on the other hand , there is some discrepancy in the region @xmath37  tev  which is not present in fig .",
    "3a . finally , the calculated curve is slightly too broad at the tail in fig .",
    "3a and too narrow in fig .",
    "3b . from this comparison",
    ", we conclude that eq .",
    "( 4 ) , supplemented with the @xmath38 correlation of fig .",
    "2 , gives a good description of the @xmath10 distribution when both the 1996 and the 1998 data are considered .",
    "the consequences of this result are quite interesting .",
    "indeed , the @xmath31 is essentially a correlation between multiplicity ( which in the rapidity region of the calorimeter is practically proportional to the number of participants ) and number of spectators .",
    "hence it can not be affected by the dimuon trigger loss affects the @xmath16 distributions of @xmath0 and @xmath12 without changing the @xmath10 ones . ] .",
    "therefore , not only the @xmath11 , but also the @xmath10 distributions of @xmath0 and @xmath12 event samples can be obtained from the corresponding ones versus @xmath9 applying the @xmath39 correlation .",
    "this is an important result since it allows to relate to each other the @xmath0 suppression versus @xmath9 and versus @xmath10 ( obtained with a different calorimeter ) and check their consistency .",
    "we show in fig .  4 the results for the ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath12 cross - sections versus @xmath10 obtained in the deconfining model @xcite and in the comovers model @xcite .",
    "the curves , are obtained from the corresponding ones versus @xmath9 ( upper solid and dashed cuerves in fig .",
    "1 ) , applying the @xmath40 correlation given by eqs . ( [ 2e ] ) and ( [ 3e ] ) and shown in fig .  2 . we keep the absolute normalizations unchanged .",
    "no @xmath16 loss is incorporated in these calculations ( see below ) .    comparing the data with the model predictions , we see that a better description of the small @xmath10 region is obtained when the @xmath9 fluctuations are taken into account .",
    "this was to be expected since the fluctuations in @xmath9 and @xmath10 are related to each other via the @xmath31 correlation  as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "as discussed above , the effect of the @xmath9 loss is not included here since @xmath10 is not affected by the dimuon trigger loss could be present in the @xmath0 suppression versus @xmath10 via the second term of eq .",
    "however , this effect should be rather small due to the large rapidity separation of the dimuon trigger and the zero degree calorimeter . ] .",
    "nevertheless , the curve obtained in the comovers approach does describe the most central data while it failed to describe the data versus @xmath9 at large @xmath9 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . this result lends support to the interpretation in ref . @xcite ",
    "namely that this discrepancy is due to the @xmath9-loss induced by the @xmath0 trigger .",
    "we also see in fig .  4 that the fall - off for central events is stronger in the deconfining than in the comovers model .",
    "the present data do not allow to discriminate between them .",
    "however , this should be possible when the shape and absolute normalization of the data are better known - possibly with the 2000 na50 data .    turning to the large @xmath10 region ( peripheral events ) , we see that the data favor the comovers model . indeed , it is clear that , in the present data , the ratio @xmath41 at large @xmath10 falls more steeply than the na50 nuclear absorption curve ",
    "fitting @xmath2 and @xmath3 data . if confirmed , this would clearly disfavor the deconfining model  where nuclear absorption is assumed to be the only source of suppression below the deconfining threshold . on the contrary ,",
    "such a feature is expected in a comovers approach , and is clearly seen in fig .  4 .    an important observation from fig .",
    "4 is the fact that the pattern of @xmath0 suppression in the na50 data is different in @xmath9 and @xmath10  at least in the region @xmath42 tev .",
    "this is at variance with the results in section 2 , according to which the shapes of the two curves should be the same .",
    "more precisely , if the shape of the @xmath0 suppression in @xmath10 is different from the one in @xmath9 for whatever reason ( for instance , due to the different calorimeters ) , the shape of the @xmath11 distribution in the two variables should also be different  and it is not .",
    "this point needs to be clarified .",
    "it should be noted here that the ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath12 differential cross - sections obtained in the standard analysis @xcite , although consistent with the one obtained in the @xmath11 analysis , do not show any sign of a different pattern with respect to the one versus @xmath16 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "5 where the standard analysis data are compared with the same theoretical curves of fig .",
    "note also that in the @xmath11 analysis the absolute normalization is not measured .",
    "it is determined from the one obtained with the standard analysis .",
    "this determination can not be precise due to the uncertainty in the shape of the @xmath0 suppression discussed above .",
    "actually , the adjustment of the absolute normalization has been done @xcite in the region @xmath43  tev  where the difference in the shape of the @xmath16 and @xmath10 distributions is the largest .",
    "further insight in the comparison of comovers and deconfining models can be gained by studying the @xmath0 suppression in lighter systems .",
    "let us compute the ratio @xmath0 over @xmath12 in @xmath3 at 200 gev / c per nucleon in the model @xcite .",
    "we use , of course , the same values of the parameters as in @xmath17  : @xmath44  mb and @xmath45  mb . to get this ratio versus @xmath20 ,",
    "the only new ingredient is the multiplicity of comovers  which is again computed in dpm , in the way described in @xcite . in this case",
    ", only @xmath46 is available ( @xmath47 has not been measured in @xmath3 ) . in @xmath3",
    ", data do not extend beyond the knee of the @xmath9-distribution .",
    "therefore , effects such as @xmath9 fluctuations or @xmath9 loss are not relevant here .",
    "to compute @xmath46 , we also need the @xmath33 correlation which is parametrized as in eq .",
    "( [ 4e ] ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath48 have been obtained from a fit of the @xmath9-distribution of @xmath12 given in @xcite .",
    "we obtain @xmath49  gev and @xmath50 .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "we see that the @xmath9 dependence of the suppression is reproduced  in spite of the fact that our @xmath51 is smaller than in the na50 nuclear absorption model .",
    "this is due to the suppression by comovers .",
    "actually , the effect of the comovers in @xmath3 is comparatively small for all values of @xmath9 .",
    "however , its contribution increases with @xmath9 and compensates for the difference in the values of @xmath51 in the two approaches",
    ".    a recent reanalysis of the @xmath2 data at 450 gev @xcite leads to a value @xmath52  mb in good agreement with the one used in the comovers approach .",
    "this value is significantly lower that the one , @xmath53  mb , used in the na50 nuclear absorption curve .",
    "a value @xmath54  mb is used in the deconfining model of ref .",
    "however , within the deconfining approach such a value of @xmath51 has the drawback of producing a @xmath0 suppression pattern in @xmath3 which is flatter than the data  unless , of course , one reduces substantially the value of the threshold , thereby introducing some anomalous suppression in su .",
    "let us now discuss the absolute normalization of the curve in fig .",
    "6a which is 46.8 .",
    "this number has to be compared with the ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath12 @xmath55 cross - sections , rescaled at 200 gev , which is @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "this nice agreement between @xmath55 and @xmath3 tends to indicate that the @xmath2 data will also be reproduced ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this is indeed the case , as shown in fig .",
    "our result gives an @xmath26-dependence between @xmath55 and @xmath57 @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "this is to be compared with the na38 value @xmath60 @xcite and with the e866 @xcite one @xmath61  % systematics .",
    "we can now compare the absolute normalization of our curve for @xmath55 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( 46.8 ) with the corresponding one for @xmath1 @xmath1 ( 59.4 ) .",
    "as we see , there is a 27  % difference .",
    "according to the na50 estimates @xcite , 9  % of this difference is due to the rescaling from @xmath3 at 200 gev to @xmath1 @xmath1 at 158 gev .",
    "this factor 1.09 contains both energy and isospin corrections practically identical to the one of @xmath0 estimated by na50  leading to a ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath12 cross - sections practically energy independent",
    ". this would solve the problem with the rescaling in energy used by na50 in which the central value for the ratio @xmath0 over @xmath12 in @xmath55 decreases between 158 gev ( 48.9 ) and 200 gev ( 46.6 ) and increases from 200 to 450 gev ( 54.7 ) . ] .",
    "therefore , it remains a real discrepancy of about 17  % in the relative normalization of @xmath55 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , on the one hand , and @xmath1 @xmath1 on the other hand .",
    "this point needs clarification .",
    "the deconfining  na50 scenario , has been described in the first lines of this work .",
    "the alternative scenario obtained in the comovers model @xcite is summarized in fig .",
    "the curves in fig .",
    "7 are obtained from the ones in figs .  1 ( @xmath17 ) , 6a ( @xmath3 ) and 6b ( @xmath55 and @xmath2 ) , using the relation between @xmath26 and @xmath62 ( in @xmath2 ) and @xmath16 and @xmath62 ( in @xmath3 and @xmath17 ) given by na38-na50 .",
    "in this figure we see that there are two different curves for @xmath2 ( dashed line ) and @xmath3 ( full line ) .",
    "this is due to the effect of the comovers .",
    "contrary to nuclear absorption , which is a universal function of @xmath62 , the comovers contribution at a given value of @xmath62 is different in different systems .",
    "in particular , its effect turns out to be negligible in @xmath2 . as already seen in fig .",
    "6a and 6b the agreement with the data is good , both in @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath17 data are not shown in this figure .",
    "they follow quite well the shape of the theoretical curve ( dashed line ) , as demonstrated in fig .  1 ( lower dashed line )",
    ". however , their absolute normalization is 17  % higher than the theoretical one , as discussed above . in the comovers model",
    ", the @xmath0 suppression in @xmath17 is larger than the one in @xmath3 ( at the same @xmath62 ) and significantly steeper - indicating an important anomalous suppression , present even in the most peripheral events .",
    "the data do support the latter result  which favors the comovers scenario .",
    "for central events , it lends support to the interpretation of ref .",
    "@xcite , according to which the discrepancy between the comovers model and @xmath15 , eq .",
    "( [ 1e ] ) , is due to the @xmath9 loss induced by the @xmath0 trigger .",
    "indeed , the data versus @xmath10 ( which are not affected by this @xmath9 loss ) are well reproduced .",
