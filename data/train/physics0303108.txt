    "our objective in this paper is to explore how one might make use of the properties of the quantum vacuum in the creation of a spacecraft .",
    "rockets employing chemical or ionic propellants require the transport of prohibitively large quantities of propellant .  if the properties of the quantum vacuum could somehow be utilized in the production of thrust , that would provide a decided advantage since the vacuum is everywhere .",
    "the three milestones for deep space or interstellar travel in the nasa breakthrough propulsion physics ( bpp ) project are : 1 ) the development of propellantless propulsion ; 2 ) the development of methods that reduce travel time by orders of magnitude ; and 3 ) new methods of providing the energy to operate the spacecraft@xcite .  at this embryonic stage in the exceedingly brief history of interstellar spacecraft",
    ", we are attempting in this paper to distinguish between what is possible and what is not possible within the context of our current understanding of the relevant physics .",
    "science fiction writers have written about the use of the quantum vacuum for spacecraft for decades but no research has validated this suggestion .",
    "arthur c. clark , who proposed geosynchonous communications satellites in 1945 , described a``quantum ramjet drive '' in 1985 in `` songs of distant earth '' , and observed in the acknowledgement , `` if vacuum fluctuations can be harnessed for propulsion by anyone besides science - fiction writers , the purely engineering problems of interstellar flight would be solvedclarke . ''",
    "since we do not know how to harness the energy of vacuum fluctuations , we have focused on a slightly different approach in this paper , and have considered how we might transfer momentum to the vacuum from the spacecraft .",
    "the spacecraft proposed in this paper , which addresses the first and last bpp milestones , is described as a `` gedanken spacecraft '' since its design is not intended as an engineering guide , but just to illustrate possibilities .  indeed based on our current understanding of quantum vacuum physics",
    ", one could reasonably argue that a better gedanken spacecraft could be propelled by oscillating a charged mirror or simply using a flashlight or laser to generate photons .",
    "although the performance of the gedanken spacecraft as presented is disappointing and is no more practical than a spacewarpthorne , it illustrates many current notions about the quanum vacuum , and it is interesting to understand the potential role of quantum vacuum phenomena in a macroscopic system like space travel .",
    "obviously , we need some major breakthroughs in our understanding if we are to realized the dream of space travel as presented in science fiction works .    in 1948 ,",
    "when physicists were developing new ideas in quantum field theory , lamb made a seminal measurement showing a shift in the energy levels of the hydrogen atom that was interpreted as due to the interaction of the atom with the quantum fluctuations of the vacuum state of the  quantized electromagnetic field@xcite .",
    "theory showed this field produced a complex radiative shift that shifted both the energy level and its lifetime@xcite .",
    "independently , casimir made a prediction of an attractive quantum vacuum force that would exist between two parallel , uncharged , metal plates due to the boundary conditions the quantized fluctuating vacuum electromagnetic field must meet on the surface of the plates@xcite .",
    "about twelve years later , lifshitz provided another explanation of the casimir effect based on fluctuations in the very long range behavior of the intermolecular potentials .",
    "five decades passed before there was experimental verification in the landmark experiments of lamoroux lamorouxusing a torsion pendulum , and mohideen@xcite using an atomic force microscope ( afm ) .  in the afm measurements a 200 @xmath0 sphere , metallized with gold ,",
    "is attached to the end of a cantilever , and moved near a flat surface .",
    "the deflection of the cantilever is measured optically , allowing the detection of n@xmath1 forces .",
    "the afm measurements have become increasingly precise and corrections due to conductivity , temperature , and surface roughness have been developed , giving agreement between theory and experiment at about the 1 % level@xcite .",
    "current efforts are designed to explore the temperature dependence of the casimir force@xcite .",
    "proposals regarding the appearance of and the use of casimir forces in micromechanical devices are being realized in microelectromechanical systems @xcite@xcite .",

    "casimir forces have recently been used to actuate a microelectromechanical torsion device@xcite .",
    "the inverse fourth power behavior of the parallel plate casimir force has been exploited to make this device operate as an anharmonic oscillator which serves as a sensitive position sensor@xcite .",
    "the concept of a vacuum force that arises from the application of boundary condition has been generalized to various geometries and topologies , and has been reviewed@xciteplunienreview@xcite .    the experimental verification of casimir s prediction is often cited as proof of the reality of the vacuum energy density of quantum field theory .",

    "casimir effects have also been derived and interpreted in terms of _ source _ fields arising from fluctuations within matter in both conventional @xcite and nonconventional @xcite quantum electrodynamics .",
    "these interpretations have spawned the evolution of two views which have proved to be equivalent in the limited systems considered to date .",
    "in one view the energy in the quantum vacuum is seen as a consequence of the fluctuations in the electrical potential from nearby matter ;  in the other view the energy in space is seen as due to the ground state of the quantized electromagnetic field .",
    "no experiment yet proposed has been shown to clearly distinguish between these two viewpoints , but to date only experiments on flat or nearly flat surfaces have been done .  experiments with resonant cavities may resolve some of these questions@xcite .",
    "theoretical calculations are often done using the simplest approach or the one of personal preference .  in this paper",
    ", we will perform computations using the quantized vacuum field model at zero kelvin and refer to the properties of the quantum vacuum , with the current understanding that an equivalvent derivation could probably be based on effects which arise from the tails of van der waals forces between molecules .",
    "intuitively one might conjecture that space travel based on the properties of the quantum vacuum is more likely to become a reality if there is actually fluctuating energy within all space , and we are not just dealing with the tails of molecular potentials of matter nearby .",
    "casimir effects result from changes in the ground - state fluctuations of a quantized field that occur because of the particular boundary conditions .",
    "casimir effects occur for all quantum fields and can also arise from the choice of topology . in the special case of the vacuum electromagnetic field with dielectric or conductive",
    "boundaries , various approaches suggest that casimir forces can be regarded as macroscopic manifestations of many - body retarded van der waals forces @xcite , @xcite .    in 1970 , moore considered the effect of an uncharged one dimensional boundary surface that moved , with the very interesting prediction that it should be possible to generate real photons from this motion@xcite .",
    "energy conservation requires the existence of a radiation reaction force working against the motion of the mirror@xcite .",
    "the energy expended moving the mirror against the radiative force goes into electromagnetic radiation .",
    "this effect , generally referred to as the dynamic or adiabatic casimir effect , has been reviewed @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the vacuum field exerts a force on the moving mirror that tends to damp the motion .",
    "this dissipative force may be understood as the mechanical effect of the emission of radiation induced by the motion of the mirror .",
    "the hamiltonian is quadratic in the field operators , and formally analogous to the hamiltonian describing photon pair creation by parametric interaction of a classical pump wave of frequency @xmath2 with a nonlinear medium@xcite .",
    "pairs of photons with frequencies @xmath3 are created out of the vacuum state .",
    "furthermore the photons have the same polarization , and the components of the corresponding wave vectors @xmath4 and @xmath5 taken along the mirror surface must add to zero because of the translational symmetry:@xmath6  this last equation relates the angles of emission of the photon pairs with respect to the unit vector @xmath7 which is normal to the surface .",
    "it is interesting that the photons emitted by the dynamic casimir effect are entangled photons .",
    "this analysis in terms of the effective hamiltonian is  illuminating but not complete for perfect mirrors , because no consistent effective hamiltonian can be constructed in this case .",
    "the dynamic casimir effect was studied for  a single , perfectly reflecting mirror with arbitrary non - relativistic motion and a scalar field in three dimensions by ford and vilenkin@xcite .",
    "they obtained expressions for the vacuum radiation pressure on the mirror .",
    "barton and eberlein  extended the analysis using a 1 dimensional scalar field to a moving body with a finite refractive index@xcite .",
    "the vacuum radiation pressure and the radiated spectrum for a non - relativistic , perfectly reflecting , infinite , plane mirror was computed by neto and machado for the electromagnetic field in three dimensions , and shown to obey the fluctuation - dissipation theorem from linear response theory@xcite@xcite .",
    "this theorem shows the fluctuations for a stationary body yield information about the mean force experienced by the body in nonuniform motion .",
    "jaekel  computed shifts in the mass of the mirror for a scalar field in two dimension@xcite .",
    "the mirror mass is not constant , but rightfully a quantum variable because of the coupling of the mirror to the fields by the radiation pressure .",
    "a detailed analysis was done by barton and calogeracos for a dispersive mirror in 1 dimension , that includes radiative shift in the mass of the mirror and the radiative reaction force@xcite .",
    "this model can be generalized to an infinitesimally thin mirror  with finite surface conductivity and a normally incident electromagnetic field .",
    "it might be of some interest to indicate why we analyze this spacecraft in terms of the dynamic casimir effect and not the unruh davies radiation .",
    "historically , unruh and davies made the seminal investigations into the thermal effects of acceleration on vacuum fluctuations@xcitedavies .",
    "they derived that a detector with constant acceleration @xmath8 for _ all _ time ( -infinity to + infinity ) would observe black body radiation at temperature @xmath9 where @xmath10 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "however , the renormalized vacuum expectation value of the stress energy momentum tensor vanishes for the field with the zero velocity detector , and by the transformation properties of tensors , it must also vanish for the accelerated state .",
    "hence the thermal quanta that excite the accelerated detector have been described as fictitious or quasi thermal quanta , although this conundrum may be more a reflection of the limited meaning of the term particle in accelerated reference frames or curved spaces@xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the thermal spectrum appears to arise not from the `` creation of particles '' but the distortion of the zero - point field@xcite .",
    "barton has observed that unresolved difficulties still obstruct any clear understanding of accounts of radiative processes referred to uniformly accelerated frames , and cites the unphysical nature of uniform acceleration for all timebartonandeberlein .",
    "hence we have adopted the language and the methods of analysis that characterize the dynamic casimir effect in our analysis of the gedanken spacecraft .",
    "all calculations of electromagnetic fields and radiative forces to date on moving plates have been for infinite plates .",
    "the contribution to the radiative force on a vibrating infinite plate due to electromagnetic radiation is the same for both sides of the plate@xcite .  from the perspective of making a numerical estimate for a finite plate ,",
    "this means the theoretical results need to be adapted .  to do this we assume that the plate is large enough with respect to the wavelengths of the fourier components of the motion so that diffraction effects are small , and that the force / area for the infinite plate is approximately the result for a finite plate .",
    "eberlein has made the very interesting suggestion that one could calculate the force for a finite two sided plate as the zero eccentricity limit of the force on an oblate spheroid@xcite@xcite .",
    "recently suggestions have been made  to measure the motion induced radiation escaping from a cavity in which one partially transmitting wall is vibrating@xcite .",
    "the rate of photon emission is enhanced by the finesse of the cavity and therefore may be orders of magnitude greater than for a plate .",
    "plunien and his collaborators showed that the rate of photon emission by a vibrating cavity can be further enhanced by several orders of magnitude if the temperature is several hundred degrees above zero kelvin@xcite .",
    "the enhancement is proportional to the ground statephoton population  at the given temperature .    in section [ sec2simmod ]",
    ", we present a simplified analysis for the use of the dynamic casimir effect to accelerate a spacecraft .",
    "also discussed is the possibility of powering the accelerating mirror with energy extracted from the quantum vacuum using the parallel plate casimir force .  in section",
    "[ sec3detailed ] a detailed description is given of a mirror trajectory that produces a net impulse during each cycle of operation .  after a discussion of some possible methods to increase the thrust and impulse , the conclusion follows .",
    "the important physical features of using the dynamic casimir effect to accelerate a spacecraft can be seen in a simplified , heuristic model .",
    "assume that the spacecraft has an energy source , such as a battery , that powers a motor that vibrates a mirror or a system of mirrors in a suitable manner to generate radiation .",
    "we will assume that there are no internal losses in the motor or energy source .",
    "we assume that at the initial time @xmath11 , the mirrors are at rest",
    ".  then the mirrors are accelerated by the motor in a suitable manner to generate a net radiative reaction on the mirror , and at the final time @xmath12 , the mirrors are no longer vibrating , and the spacecraft has attained a non - zero momentum .",
    "we can apply the first law of thermodynamics to the system of the energy source , motor , and mirror at times @xmath13 and @xmath12 : @xmath14where @xmath15 represents the change in the internal energy in the energy source , @xmath16 represents the work done on the mirrors moving against the vacuum , and @xmath17 represents any heat transferred between the system and the environment",
    ".  we will assume that we have a thermally isolated system and @xmath18 so @xmath19    by the conservation of energy , the energy @xmath15 extracted from the battery goes into work done on the moving mirror @xmath20  since the mirror has zero vibrational kinetic energy and zero potential energy at the beginning and the end of the acceleration period , and is assumed to operate with no mechanical friction , all work done on the mirror goes into the energy of the emitted radiation and the kinetic energy of the spacecraft of mass @xmath21@xmath22  thus the energy of the radiation emitted due to the dynamic casimir effect equals @xmath23    the frequency of the emitted photons depends on the fourier components of the motion of the mirror .",
    "we assume that the radiant energy can be expressed as a sum of energies of @xmath24 photons each with frequency @xmath25 : @xmath26let us assume that all photons are emitted normally from one side of the accelerating surface .",
    "this assumption is not valid , as eq.1 and the work of neto and machado @xcite clearly show , but it allows us to obtain a best case scenario and illustrates the main physical features .",
    "if all photons are emitted normally from one surface , then the total momentum transfer @xmath27  is : @xmath28where @xmath29 is the speed of light .  using eq .",
    "[ deltar ] , we obtain the result:@xmath30    in a non - relativistic approximation @xmath31 and the change in velocity @xmath32 of the spacecraft is to second order in @xmath33:@xmath34this represents a maximum change in velocity attainable by use of the dynamic casimir effect ( or by the emission of electromagnetic radiation generated by more conventional means ) when the energy @xmath15 is expended .  the ratio @xmath33is expected to be a small number , and we can neglect the second term in eq .",
    "( as a point of reference ,  for a chemical fuel the ratio of the heat of formation to the mass energy is approximately @xmath35 . )  with this approximation , we find the maximum value of @xmath36 equals @xmath37 the energy obtained from the energy source divided by the rest mass energy of the spacecraft .",

    "these assumptions are consistent with a heuristic non - relativistic approximation .     in this simplified model",
    ", we have not made any estimates about the rate of photon emission and how long it would take to reach the maximum velocity .",
    "rates are typically very low , typically @xmath42 photons / sec netoandmachado .      in order to explore the possibility of a spacecraft that is based completely on quantum vacuum properties ,",
    "consider the use of an arrangement of perfectly conducting , uncharged , parallel plates in vacuum as an energy source .",
    "the casimir energy @xmath43 at zero degrees kelvin between plates of area @xmath44 , separated by a distance @xmath45 is:@xmath46    if we allow the plates to move from a large initial separation @xmath8 to a very small final separation @xmath47 then the change in the vacuum energy energy between the plates is approximately:@xmath48    the attractive casimir force has done work on the plates , and , in principal , we can build a device to extract this energy with a suitable , reversible , isothermal process , and use it to accelerate the mirrors .",

    "as anticipated , the gedanken spacecraft is very slow despite the unrealistically favorable assumptions made in the calculation , yet it does demonstrate that it is possible to base the operation of a spacecraft entirely on the properties of the quantum vacuum .",
    "let us briefly comment on the long range possibility of extracting larger amounts of energy from vacuum fluctuations .",
    "if , for example , it were possible to make a structure equivalent to a parallel plate structure that could have a final state with a separation 100 or 1000 times smaller than as assumed above , then we would have the suggestion of a spacecraft operating in the relativistic regime .  without a new approach ,",
    "such a development is probably not possible since the casimir force decreases for separations less than the plasma wavelength .",
    "( several new approaches are discussed in section [ sectioninaccel ] . )",
    "the reflectivity of a metal plate depends on the applied frequency , and for frequencies above the plasma frequency the reflectivity drops , causing the casimir force  to decrease .",
    "alternatively , if there were a device that could continuously extract energy from the quantum fluctuations of the vacuum field , then this vacuum powered spacecraft , and a lot of other unusual things , might become practical .",
    "it is important to note that utilizing energy of the quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field does not appear to directly violate known laws of physics , based on the work of forward and cole and puthoff , however improbable or impossible such a development might seem forward@xcite .",
    "forward showed that it is possible to conceive of a device , a foliated capacitor , in which one could extract electrical energy from the quantum vacuum to do work .",
    "the energy is extracted as the portions of the capacitor that repel each other due to electrostatic forces come together under the influence of the casimir force@xcite .",
    "cole and puthoff used stochastic electrodynamics to examine the process of removing energy from the vacuum fluctuations at zero temperature from the viewpoint of thermodynamics and showed there is no violation of the laws of thermodynamics@xcite .",
    "in the same spirit , rueda has suggested that very high energy particles observed in space may derive their kinetic energy from a long term acceleration due to the stochastic vacuum field@xcite .  in a careful analysis",
    ", cole has shown that this process of energy transfer from the vacuum field to kinetic energy of the particles does not violate the laws of thermodynamicscolethermod .  in stochastic electrodynamics",
    "one treats the vacuum fluctuations as a universal random classical electromagnetic field .  a formal analogy exists between stochastic electrodynamics and quantum electrodynamics :  the field correlation functions in one theory are related to the wightman functions in the other theory@xcite .",

    "it is our opinion that further research is needed to gain a greater understanding of what is possible and what are the fundamental limitations and restrictions in processes involving energy transfer with the quantum vacuum .",
    "one can take an alternative viewpoint here , that we are just extracting energy from the tails of the molecular potentials , and that much more energy would be available if we utilized the entire potential , for example , by burning the material .",

    "the divergent first term can be understood in several ways .",
    "physically it is a dispersive force that arises from the scattering of low frequency evanescent waves .",
    "the divergence can be related to the unphysical nature of the perfect conductor boundary conditions . forcing the field to vanish on the surface",
    "requires its conjugate momentum to be unbounded .",
    "thus the average of the stress - energy tensor @xmath76 is singular at the surface for the same reason that single - particle quantum mechanics would require a position eigenstate to have infinite energy@xcite .",
    "this divergent term can be lumped into a mass renormalization , and therefore disappears from the dynamical equations when they are expressed in terms of the observed mass of the body@xcite@xcite .",

    "further we have shown that one could in principal utilize energy from the vacuum fluctuations to operate such a vibrating mirror assembly .",
    "the application of the dynamic casimir effect and the static casimir effect may be regarded as a proof of principal , with the hope that the proven feasibility will stimulate more practical approaches exploiting known or as yet unknown features of the quantum vacuum .  in any event ,",

    "an article was published in scientific american proving that it was impossible to send a rocket , using a conventional propellant , to the moon .",
    "the result was based on the seemingly innocuous assumption of a single stage rocket .    from the status of current research in casimir forces , it is clear that we understand little of the properties of the quantum vacuum for real systems with real material properties .  for example , there is no general agreement with regard to the calculations of static vacuum forces for geometries other than infinite parallel plates of ideal or real metals at a temperature of absolute zero .  for non - zero temperatures corrections for flat , real metals are uncertain@xcite@xcite .",
    "there are fundamental disagreements about the computation of vacuum forces for spheres or rectangular cavities , about how to handle real material properties and curvature in these and other geometries@xcite .  indeed , it is very difficult to calculate casimir forces for these simple geometries geometries and to relate the calculations to an experiment .",

    "the mass shift is anticipated to arise from the decrease in the vacuum energy between the parallel plates .",
    "a calculation shows that the mass shift for the proposed cavity is at or just beyond the current limit of detectability .",
    "it appears that if quantum vacuum engineering of spacecraft is to become practical , and the dreams of science fiction writers are to be realized , we may need to develop new methods to be able to manipulate changes in vacuum energy densities that are near to the same order of magnitude as mass energy densities",
