    "neutron stars ( nss ) with magnetic field @xmath0 stronger than the quantum critical value , @xmath1 g , are called magnetars .",
    "observationally , a magnetar may appear as a soft gamma - ray repeater ( sgr ) or an anomalous x - ray pulsar ( axp ) .",
    "it is believed that its persistent x - ray luminosity is powered by the consumption of their @xmath0-decay energy ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* duncan & thompson 1992 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paczynski 1992 ) ) .",
    "however , the formation of strong @xmath0 of a magnetar remains unresolved , and the possible explanations are divided into three classes : ( i ) @xmath0 is generated by a convective dynamo ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* duncan & thompson 1992 ) ) ; ( ii ) @xmath0 is essentially of fossil origin ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ruderman 1972 ) ; ( * ? ? ? * ferrario & wickramasinghe 2006 ) ) ; and ( iii ) @xmath0 has evolved from some radio pulsars after many glitches ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lin & zhang 2004 ) ) . in this paper",
    "we propose that a magnetar is likely formed during the hyperaccreting process of nss .",
    "stage 1 : _ @xmath0 magnified significantly in hyperaccreting process . _",
    "it is generally believed that @xmath0 , which could be magnified by magneto - rational instability ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* balbus & hawley 1991 ) ) or dynamo process on the disk , affects the angular momentum transfer effectively via a variety of modes ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* blandford 1976 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* blandford & payne 1982 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* balbus & hawley 1991 ) ) . for hyperaccretion disks",
    ", @xmath0 must be magnified extremely strongly so that the accretion rate can be as high as @xmath2 . in detailed magnetohydrodynamic simulations of binary ns merger processes ,",
    "@xmath0 is amplified by kelvin - helmholtz instabilities , and finally grows to @xmath3 g ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* price & rosswog 2006 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* giacomazzo , rezzolla & baiotti 2009 ) ) .",
    "the basic equations describing the magnetized hyperaccretion flow consist of the angular momentum equation , energy equation and the equation of state ( di matteo et al .",
    "2002 ; lovelace , 1995 ; xie et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "stage 2 : _",
    "@xmath0 inherited by the central ns . _",
    "the magnified @xmath0 in the form of loops and chaotic configuration is sheared by the disk differential rotation , leading to open field lines ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* romanova 1998 ) ) .",
    "the fields froze - in to highly conducting disk plasma , are transported to the central object by the inward motion of the disk matter ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ghosh & abramowicz 1997 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* spruit & uzdensky 2005 ) ) .",
    "we get the magnetic flux of the whole disk by @xmath4 if the poloidal field @xmath5 anchored at the disk could be mainly collected and inherited by the central ns , the field strength near its pole area can be as high as @xmath6 .",
    "this means that a magnetar is formed during the hyperaccreting process . for the new - born magnetar , its dipole fields",
    "are mainly composed of @xmath5 and radial component @xmath7 of the disk , since they are closely related to the toroidal current in the disk , and the toroidal component @xmath8 corresponds to multipolar fields .",
    "the ratios of the field components of the disk are quite similar to the field configuration of a magnetar .    stage 3 : _ @xmath0-decay and dominant toroidal field component .",
    "_ several avenues exist for @xmath0-decay in isolated nss : ohmic decay , ambipolar diffusion , and hall drift ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* goldreich & reisenegger 1992 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* heyl & kulkarni 1998 ) ) . depending on the strength of @xmath0",
    ", each process may dominate the evolution .",
    "it has been found that the power released by the decay of dipole fields can not fuel the persistent x - ray luminosity of several magnetars",
    ". however , the power released by the decay of the toroidal component is sufficient for persistent x - ray luminosity of all magnetars .",
    "this could be an indirect observational evidence for the existence of their dominant toroidal @xmath0 .",
    "we suggest that a magnetar could be formed during the coalescence of binary nss or collapse of a massive star , through collecting and inheriting the magnetic fields magnified by the hyperaccreting disk .",
    "after the magnetar is born , its dipole magnetic fields in turn have a major influence on the following accretion .",
    "the decay of toroidal fields can fuel the persistent x - ray luminosity of either an sgr or axp ; however the decay of only the poloidal field is insufficient to do so ."
