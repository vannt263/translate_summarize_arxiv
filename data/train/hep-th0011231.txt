    "a number of dynamical systems of physical interest possess field - dependent symplectic forms which degenerate , becoming noninvertible for some particular configurations .",
    "systems as diverse as vortex interactions in fluids @xcite , and gravitation theories in dimensions @xmath0 containing higher powers of curvature in the lagrangian exhibit this feature ( see e.g. @xcite ) . models of this kind naturally arise in different contexts of current high energy physics , ranging from cosmology and brane worlds @xcite to strings an m - theory @xcite .    the problem is how to describe the evolution of the system near a degenerate configuration and , if it could reach such state , how it would evolve afterwards .",
    "the standard hypotheses in the treatment of dynamical systems , however , exclude the possibility that the symplectic form may have nonconstant rank throughout phase space , even in classical mechanics ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .    as a first step towards understanding the general problem , here we analyze",
    "degenerate dynamical systems in classical mechanics .",
    "we show that it is possible to fully characterize the evolution of these systems .",
    "it should be emphasized that this degeneracy is independent of poincar s classification of singularities .",
    "a poincar singularity occurs at critical points of the hamiltonian , which are generically isolated , whereas the symplectic form degenerates on surfaces which are generically domain walls .",
    "this kind of surfaces can not be understood as dense sets of poincar singularities .",
    "roughly speaking , a symplectic degeneracy is the counterpart of a poincar singularity in that , in the latter the gradient of the hamiltonian vanishes , whereas the former can be interpreted as an infinite gradient .",
    "the previous point can be made more explicit , by considering the simplest example of a degenerate system , whose phase flow satisfies @xmath1 with @xmath2 , which degenerates at @xmath3 .",
    "an equivalent formulation in the @xmath4 region is @xmath5 which can be viewed as a phase flow where the gradient of the hamiltonian diverges as @xmath6 .",
    "the required symplectomorphism ( canonical transformation ) to obtain eq .",
    "( [ simplest2 ] ) from eq .",
    "( [ simplest ] ) is noninvertible throughout phase space , however .",
    "let us consider a system whose action is a one - form @xmath7 , integrated over a @xmath8-dimensional worldline embedded in a @xmath9-dimensional spacetime of signature @xmath10 , @xmath11=\\int_{1}^{2}a_{\\mu } \\dot{z}^{\\mu } d\\tau \\ ; ,   \\label{action}\\ ] ] the field @xmath12 is a prescribed set of @xmath13 functions of the embedding coordinates @xmath14 , which are the dynamical variables @xcite .",
    "this action is manifestly invariant under reparametrizations of the worldline @xmath15 , and diffeomorphisms @xmath16 @xcite . identifying the affine parameter with the timelike embedding coordinate @xmath17 , so that @xmath18 , the action reads @xmath11=\\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}[a_{i}\\dot{z}^{i}+a_{0}]dt\\;.   \\label{action'}\\ ] ] the equations of motion are given by @xmath19 where we have defined @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in the following ,",
    "we assume @xmath22 and @xmath23 to be time - independent .",
    "these dynamical systems are naturally classified according to the rank @xmath24 of the symplectic form @xmath25 .",
    "thus , three cases are distinguished : * ( a ) * regular hamiltonian systems , for which the symplectic form has constant maximal rank , @xmath26 throughout phase space @xmath27 @xcite . *",
    "( b ) * singular or constrained hamiltonian systems , which have a constant nonmaximal rank , @xmath28 throughout @xmath27 @xcite . and , * ( c ) * degenerate systems , which have nonconstant rank @xmath29 throughout @xmath27 .",
    "we will focus our discussion in the degenerate case ( c ) , which has been traditionally left aside in the literature .",
    "we will assume that the zero - measure subset of @xmath27 given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 , is not dense .",
    "thus , outside @xmath32 , the symplectic form @xmath25 has a constant rank @xmath33 , and the dynamical structure there is described through cases ( a ) above . is less than maximal in the complement of @xmath34 ,",
    "is a combination of cases ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "it is straighforward to consider this additional complication , but it does not add much to deserve an extensive discussion here . ]    under these conditions , nothing prevents the system , starting from a generic state for which @xmath35 , from reaching a point on @xmath32 after some finite time .",
    "having this scenario in mind , we address the following points :    @xmath36 the description of the locus of @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath36 *  * classification of the phase flow near @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath36 *  * whether @xmath32 can be reached and , in that case , the fate of the system thereafter .",
    "as is well known , a skew - symmetric @xmath37 matrix @xmath38 can be brought into the block - diagonal form by an orthogonal transformation .",
    "thus the two - form @xmath39 can be block diagonalized in an open set , under a local @xmath40 coordinate transformation @xmath41 , @xmath42    however , _  in open sets containing points of the degeneracy surfaces , the darboux - like coordinates _ @xmath43 _  can not be brought into the standard canonical form , because at least one of the _ @xmath44 _",
    "s in _ ( [ canonicalf ] )",
    "_  vanishes at _ @xmath32_. _ hence , further ( finite ) rescalings can not normalize the @xmath44 s to @xmath45 . as a consequence ,",
    "the set @xmath32 is the union of the @xmath46-dimensional surfaces @xmath47 that is , @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , by virtue of the bianchi identity ( @xmath49 ) , it can be shown that @xmath50 depends only on the pair of conjugate coordinates @xmath51 .",
    "this means that the degeneracy surfaces are constant along the remaining coordinates .",
    "we assume that the @xmath44 s are smooth morse functions on the corresponding @xmath52 planes , which ensures that they possess only simple zeros except at isolated points ; the cases where @xmath44 has zeros of higher order can be thought of as the merging of simple zeros .",
    "hence , the level curves @xmath53 divide the @xmath52plane into nonoverlapping sets and therefore ,    * lemma 1 : * the locus of the degeneracy surfaces @xmath32  corresponds to a collection of domain walls , splitting the phase space @xmath54into a number of nonoverlapping regions .",
    "generically , at a surface @xmath55 the rank @xmath29 is lowered by @xmath56 , and at points where @xmath57 of these surfaces intersect , @xmath58 is lowered by @xmath59 . in a sufficiently small neighborhood of the surface @xmath60 , the behavior of the system",
    "is dominated by the dynamical variables @xmath61 , whose corresponding equations of motion can be read from eq .",
    "( [ e - l ] ) as @xmath62 where for simplicity , we have set @xmath63 , so that @xmath64 and @xmath65 and @xmath66 . near a degeneracy surface @xmath55 , the remaining dynamical variables @xmath67",
    ", @xmath68 ,  behave like the phase space coordinates of a regular system .",
    "here it is assumed that @xmath69 , remains finite and does not vanish on @xmath70 ( i.e. , poincar singularities are assumed to be located outside @xmath32 ) , therefore , eq .",
    "( [ hamilton ] ) implies that the velocity becomes tangent to the @xmath71 plane , because the components @xmath72 become unbounded as the orbit approaches @xmath73 , while the other components ( @xmath74 ) remain finite .    due to",
    "the fact that @xmath75 has a simple zero at @xmath70 , @xmath76 reverses its sign across the degeneracy surface .",
    "consequently , the phase flow evolves in opposite directions on each side of @xmath32 .",
    "thus , in a local neighborhood of @xmath32 , one of the following three situations occur : ( a ) orbits flow towards @xmath32 and end there , ( b ) the orbits originate at the degeneracy surface and flow away from it , or ( c ) the orbits run parallel to @xmath32 , but in opposite directions on each side .    hence , the surfaces act as sinks or sources for the orbits in cases ( a ) and ( b ) respectively , which naturally suggests a classification of the local nature of @xmath32 into @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 for the cases ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    in all three cases",
    "there is no flux across the degeneracy surface , and therefore ,    * lemma 2 : * the regions on either side of @xmath32  are causally disconnected and dynamically independent from each other .",
    "an immediate consequence of this , is the violation of liouville s theorem at the surfaces of degeneracy .",
    "in fact , outside the degeneracy surfaces , the liouville current @xmath80 is divergence - free ( @xmath81 ) by virtue of the equations of motion and the identity @xmath82 , with @xmath83 .",
    "this means that liouville s theorem holds outside @xmath32 , where the dynamical behavior is regular .",
    "moreover , @xmath84 has a finite limit as the system approaches a degeneracy surface , whose only nonvanishing components on each side of @xmath32 are @xmath85    the local character of the degeneracy surfaces @xmath32 , can be inferred from the flux of @xmath84 across a pill box enclosing a portion of @xmath32 .",
    "the flux density @xmath86 across the lids of the pill box is given by the projection of @xmath84 along the normal to the surface @xmath87 , whose only non vanishing components are @xmath88 , that is , @xmath89 note that @xmath90 is not only finite , but continuous on @xmath32 . therefore ,    * lemma 3 : * the local character of the degeneracy surfaces is given by @xmath91  with @xmath92 .",
    "furthermore , in general ,  @xmath34  is globally piecewise attractive ( @xmath77 )  or repulsive ( @xmath93 ) , and is of type @xmath94 at the intersections with the surfaces @xmath95 ( see fig .",
    "=3 in [ degsurfaces ]    hence , @xmath94 generically corresponds to the boundaries between @xmath96 and @xmath78 ( that is , @xmath97 ) which is a subset of codimension @xmath56 in phase space .    in the particular case ,",
    "when both surfaces @xmath32 and @xmath98 coincide on an open set , @xmath32 is globally of type @xmath94 .",
    "this occurs for example , if @xmath99 , whose only nonvanishing components are of the form @xmath100 for some functions @xmath101 and @xmath102  @xcite .      the degeneracy surfaces @xmath78and @xmath77 represent sets of initial and final states of the system , respectively .",
    "configurations at a surface @xmath78 are unstable against small perturbations , and it seems unlikely that a system could be prepared there . on the other hand , if one considers the system at @xmath77 , a small perturbation to move it away from the surface would require an infinite acceleration . in this sense ,",
    "the surfaces @xmath77 represent stable final states for the evolution of the system , and any initial configuration sufficiently near the degeneracy surface is doomed to fall on it .",
    "then , the question whether the system can be consistently defined on @xmath77 naturally arises .    for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider a system possessing a single surface of degeneracy which is globally of type @xmath77 .",
    "we will now show that when the system reaches @xmath77 , two coordinates become non dynamical ; the system acquires a new gauge symmetry on the degeneracy surface which corresponds to displacements along @xmath77 , and one degree of freedom is lost .    following dirac s approach for constrained systems @xcite ,",
    "the action ( [ action ] ) possess @xmath33 primary constraints coming from the definition of the canonical momenta @xmath103 , @xmath104 whose poisson brackets are @xmath105 . outside",
    "@xmath106 , the invertibility of @xmath25 implies that the constraints @xmath107 are second class .",
    "however , at the degeneracy surface , the rank of @xmath108 is reduced by two , thus , two of the @xmath109 s have vanishing poisson brackets with the whole set of constraints .",
    "although the constraint structure changes abruptly at @xmath77 , after the system reaches this surface , its evolution can be described by a standard constrained system , as can be seen through a suitable change of basis for the constraints @xmath110 .",
    "linear combinations of the form @xmath111 , become first class provided @xmath112 are null vectors of @xmath108 .",
    "this can only happen at the degeneracy surface , where there are two of such vectors .",
    "they can be chosen so that one is tangent and the other is normal to the surfaces @xmath113  constant , namely , @xmath114 and @xmath115 . in darboux - like",
    "coordinates , their only nonvanishing components are @xmath116 and @xmath117 , with @xmath118 .    in the basis @xmath119 , with @xmath120 , the constraint algebra reads ,    @xmath121    > from this it is apparent that , on the surface @xmath77 , the constraints @xmath122 have vanishing poisson brackets , and are therefore candidates for first class constraints .    in order to examine whether @xmath122 are first or second class at the degeneracy surface ( @xmath123 ) , it is necessary to compute their poisson brackets with @xmath75 .",
    "the only non vanishing bracket involving @xmath75 is @xmath124 which can not vanish on @xmath32 because , by hypothesis , @xmath75 has a simple zeros there .",
    "this shows that @xmath125 is first class , while , ( @xmath126 ) form a conjugate pair of second class constraints .",
    "the transformations generated by @xmath122 correspond to @xmath127 , and @xmath128 thus , the constraints @xmath125 and @xmath129 generate tangent and normal displacements to @xmath77 respectively , as expected .",
    "hence , @xmath130 can be viewed as the gauge fixing condition associated with the `` gauge generator '' @xmath129 .",
    "this is summarized in the following    * lemma 4 : * on the degeneracy surface @xmath77 , the system acquires a new gauge invariance , because the second class constraint @xmath131 becomes first class , while the number of second class constraints ( @xmath132 ) remains the same ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "since each first class constraint eliminates one degree of freedom , we conclude that one degree of freedom is dynamically frozen on the degeneracy surface .",
    "we illustrate these results in the following examples .",
    "the simplest case of a degenerate dynamical system is provided by the lagrangian @xmath133 with @xmath134 .",
    "the symplectic form , @xmath135 , degenerates at the surface @xmath3 , which is of type @xmath136 , with @xmath137 .",
    "the orbits run perpendicular to @xmath136 and take a finite time to connect a point on the surface with a point outside .",
    "this example captures the essence of the behavior of any degenerate system in a neighborhood of a degeneracy surface of type @xmath78 or @xmath106 .",
    "in particular , the shock - wave solutions of burgers equation , @xmath138 which is relevant in the context of turbulence , exhibit this behavior",
    ". these solutions are of the form @xmath139 where @xmath140are complex coordinates which come in conjugate pairs and satisfy a vortex - like equation@xcite .",
    "the corresponding equations of motion for @xmath141  can be obtained from an action of the form ( [ action ] ) , which for @xmath142  and @xmath143  reads @xmath144 whose associated lagrangian , is precisely given by ( [ ld ] ) .",
    "this solution describes a one dimensional shock wave centered at @xmath145 , with peaks at @xmath146  of height @xmath147 , travelling outwards from @xmath148 .",
    "the next example examines explicitly the fate of a degenerate system when it reaches a surface of type @xmath77 .",
    "a simple lagrangian for which this occurs is of the form @xmath149 here , @xmath150 with @xmath151 , is some two - dimensional degenerate system possessing a global surface of type @xmath77 at @xmath152 ; @xmath153 is a regular system with hamiltonian @xmath154 , and @xmath155 is an interaction term of the form @xmath156 this coupling is chosen so that it vanishes on @xmath77 and does not change the flux density @xmath90 there , so that the character of the degeneracy surface does not depend on the coupling constant @xmath157 .",
    "note that this coupling would be trivial in case of nondegenerate systems .",
    "furthermore , the presence of @xmath158 in the coupling implies that , besides the conservation of the total hamiltonian @xmath159 , the equations of motion @xmath160 give rise to a separate conservation law for @xmath158 , because @xmath161 . in turn",
    ", this implies that the remaining equations of motion @xmath162 can be integrated as an autonomous two - dimensional subsystem . once these equations have been solved , and their solutions substituted in ( [ er ] ) , it is apparent that , the solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ er ] ) describe the same orbits as in the decoupled case ( @xmath163 ) but with a reparametrized time , @xmath164 with @xmath165 note that as the orbits approach the surface @xmath77 , this time reparametrization remains finite .",
    "once the system reaches the degeneracy surface ( @xmath166 ) , both time coordinates become identical and , _ on _ @xmath77 _ , all traces of the degenerate subsystem disappear , including the information about its initial conditions _ @xmath167 .",
    "thus from the moment the degeneracy surface is reached , the system becomes a regular one , described by @xmath153 , and the degrees of freedom of the degenerate system are forever lost .    in order to illustrate this point , consider the degenerate lagrangian given by eq .",
    "( [ ld ] ) with @xmath168 , coupled with a one dimensional harmonic oscillator in the form ( [ coupling ] ) . in that case",
    ", the total energy is @xmath169 , where @xmath170 is the energy of the harmonic oscillator , which is separately conserved . eq .",
    "( [ ed ] ) is readily integrated as @xmath171 for@xmath172 , and @xmath173afterwards .    hence , the harmonic oscillator coordinates @xmath174 evolve according to @xmath175 with @xmath176 , where the reparametrized time is given by @xmath177^{3/2}\\;,\\ ] ] for  @xmath178 , and @xmath179 afterwards .",
    "the degeneracy of the symplectic form opens up the possibility of a violation of liouville s theorem .",
    "in fact , the divergence of the current @xmath180 reads @xmath181\\partial _ { j}a_{0}-\\sqrt{f}% f^{ij}\\partial _",
    "{ i}\\partial _ { j}a_{0}.\\ ] ] if @xmath182 is continuous and differentiable , the second term in the r.h.s .",
    "vanishes identically .",
    "however , the first term can give rise to a non - zero contribution , responsible for the jump in the flow accross @xmath183 . in this sense , the problem we address here is the counterpart of poincar classical study of singularities in the phase flow .",
    "both cases correspond to different classes of possible singularities in the phase flow , and hence , the degeneracy surfaces can not be understood as a dense set of poincar s singularities .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the extension of our analysis to field theory would lead to the possibility that the symplectic form degenerates for field configurations where some local degrees of freedom should freeze out and some field components become nondynamical . in the case of higher dimensional gravity , this means that as the system reaches a degeneracy surface , some dynamical components of the metric become redundant , which would correspond to a sort of dynamical dimensional reduction mechanism .",
    "the quantum mechanical analysis of this kind of degenerate systems , shows that there is no tunneling across a surface of degeneracy @xmath32 , but there is a nonvanishing propagation amplitude between states in the bulk and on @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "these results would be relevant for the quantum hall effect @xcite , and also for strings propagating in a background possessing a nonconstant @xmath184-field @xcite .",
