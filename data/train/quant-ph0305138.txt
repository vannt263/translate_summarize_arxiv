    "the controlled manipulation of orbital angular momenta ( oam ) degrees of freedom of light photon s has opened a new field of potential applications in quantum information , like the experimental realization of entanglement with oam states of photons using parametric down conversion ( pdc ) that conserves the angular momentum @xcite , the preparation of photons with oam states @xcite , measurements of the oam in a single photon @xcite and the construction of oam sorters @xcite , @xcite , that discriminates single photons with different angular momentum by sorting them out , etc .",
    "these developments point towards a feasible employement of the orbital angular momentum of photons to achieve quantum cryptography with higher alphabets increasing the information flux through the communication channels , checking bell s inequalities in qudit states , spintronics , capacity - increased quantum information schemes , etc .",
    "in addition to spin angular momentum , photons can also carry orbital angular momentum @xcite .",
    "the spin comes from the polarization while the oam from the azimutal phase of the complex electric field .",
    "this is a quantum winding number associated to photons : each photon of a beam with an azimutal phase dependence of the form @xmath0 carries an oam of @xmath1 .",
    "these novel laser beams are produced in the form of laguerre - gaussian ( lg ) modes of the electromagnetic field in the paraxial aproximation .",
    "each of these modes are defined by two integers @xmath2 and @xmath3 and denoted as lg@xmath4 ; they are related to azimutal and radial properties of the beam . in quantum information ,",
    "the quantum number @xmath2 is used to code the computational basis of a multidimensional qubit , also known as qudits .",
    "when dealing with entanglement of qubits , sooner or later we must face the decoherence problem and the same applies for qudits . to cope with the degradation of entanglement we need to resort to a purification or distillation protocol like the one introduced by bennett et al .",
    "( bbpssw ) @xcite .",
    "these and other spinoffs protocols require the quantum cnot gate to operate on the entangled states .",
    "recently , pan et al .",
    "@xcite have proposed a variation of the bbpssw protocol which does not rely on the cnot gate but only on simple linear optical elements like the polarization beam splitter ( pbs ) . in this case , qubits were considered as the two independent polarization of photons ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "this is a very remarkable proposal since there is an enormous difference in the experimental effort required between implementing the cnot operation an overlapping two photons on a polarization beam splitter",
    ".    it would be interesting to have a distillation protocol for qudits with similar properties as the one of pan et al .",
    "@xcite , using some sort of generalized beam splitters . here",
    "we develop one such a scheme .",
    "although we are clearly inspired by the existence of qudits realized as oam states of photons , we want to stress that our constructions are independent of this concrete realization and we shall describe them from an abstract viewpoint .",
    "we shall use the standard notation for denoting the computational basis states for qudits , @xmath6 @xmath7 instead of the physical notation @xmath8 . we will also consider even and odd values of @xmath9 .",
    "the following result is central in our constructions .",
    "_ _ there is an exact mapping ( one - to - one ) between the polarization beam splitter and a certain realization of the cnot gate for qudits .",
    "proof : by construction .",
    "we need to construct a generalization of the pbs for qudits such that it faithfully implements the cnot gate @xmath10 defined as @xcite , @xmath11 we shall refer to the generalized beam splitter for qudits as the orbital angular momentum beam - splitter ( oam - bs ) .",
    "this is a black - box that takes @xmath9 directions , or channels , as input and convert them into @xmath9 output directions . in doing so ,",
    "when the light is in each of the oam states @xmath12 entering one of the input directions , then the oam - bs converts that state into another outgoing state according to precise rules .",
    "we construct these rules with an operator @xmath13 that implements the action of this oam - bs . in order to reproduce the action of the cnot gate as a beam splitter",
    ", we define the action of @xmath13 on input states @xmath14 along the direcion @xmath15 as follows @xmath16 the action of the generalized beam splitter changes the outgoing direction with respect to the incoming direction while leaving the qudit state unchanged .",
    "as an example , the action of @xmath17 for qutrits is depicted in fig .",
    "[ oamqutrits ] .",
    "notice that the essential ingredient in these beam splitters is the existence of as many input / output directions as states the qudits have , and the consideration of these directions as an effective second qudit . to see that this construction is correct ,",
    "let us realize that for qubits @xmath18 , we have @xmath19 , with @xmath20 denoting the horizontal / vertical polarizations of photons according to the mapping @xmath21 .",
    "thus , we recover the cnot construction for qubits in terms of a pbs as in @xcite .",

    "@xcite called `` four - mode case '' property : when the 4 channels ( 2 input , 2 output ) of @xmath37 are occupied by states then we are sure that on the input directions we have equal states , either @xmath38 or @xmath39 .",
    "this property follows inmediately from our construction ( [ s2 ] ) .",
    "it turns out that this property is crucial to perform a distillation protocol based on a pbs instead of a cnot gate .",
    "we need a generalization of this property for qudits , but the following result indicates that we must be careful in doing so .    _ _ a straightforward generalization of the `` four - mode case '' property for qudits does not hold true",
    ".    proof : the direct extension of this property means that we may try to demand that when the @xmath40 channels ( @xmath9 input , @xmath9 output ) of @xmath27 are occupied by states @xmath41 , with @xmath42 , then we are sure that on the input directions we have equal states of the form @xmath43 . to see that this extension does not hold true , it suffices to give the following counter example . for the case of qutrits ,",
    "@xmath44 , we can check with ( [ s2 ] ) or fig .",
    "[ oamqutrits ] that @xmath45 which implies that all the 6 channels are occupied while the input channels have unequal states . at this point",
    "we may think that the definition ( [ s2 ] ) is not appropriate .",
    "however , we can give a more general reason as to why this extension does not work .",
    "let us notice that having @xmath9 input channels , the number of possible output states with non - empty outgoing directions is @xmath46 , but corresponding to this number of outputs we have that the number of all - equal input states of the form @xmath47 is only @xmath9 .",
    "thus , in order to guarantee that whenever the output channels are occupied then the input channels are occupied by all - equal states we must demand that @xmath48 , whose only solution is @xmath18 ( qubits ) .",
    "@xmath49    to overcome this difficulty , we have found that the following generalization is good enough for the purpose of qudit distillation with an oam - bs instead of a cnot gate .",
    "_ _ the `` @xmath40-extended mode case '' property , denoted by `` @xmath40-emc '' for short , is defined as follows : when the @xmath40 output and input channels are occupied then we have some means to be sure that the input and output states are all equal .",
    "@xmath49    this means that for @xmath50 we need extra information not contained in @xmath27 in order to perform the qudit distillation based on a oam - bs .",
    "lemma 2 guarantees us that this is the unique extension of the `` 4-mode case '' property to qudits .",
    "the graphical content of the `` @xmath40-emc '' property is shown in fig .",
    "[ 2demc ] , which rules out a situation like that in ( [ s3 ] ) .",

    "this is like if we had some sort of `` color property '' associated to @xmath41 in order to discriminate them .",
    "with the ingredients introduced so far , we are able to set up a purification protocol for qudits that implements the scheme of bennet et al . @xcite following the prescription introduced by pan et al . @xcite of substituting the cnot gates by oam - bs .",

    "this is a clear difference with respect to the standard purification scheme like the bbpssw protocol @xcite that employ only 2 pairs @xmath82 .",
    "we use the following notation @xmath83 where the subscripts have the following important meaning : @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) denotes alice s ( bob s ) qudit entering the channel @xmath15 of the oam - bs .    _",

    "this state is a probabilistic mixture of the following types of states : non - crossed terms @xmath87 @xmath88 , and the remaining crossed terms @xmath89 .",

    "as for the non - crossed terms , we also expand them in the computational basis ( [ g3 ] ) and then the `` 2d - emc '' property projects each of these states labeled by @xmath15 onto the non - normalized states @xmath90 it is important to notice that now the subscripts in ( [ s5 ] ) denote outgoing channels in the oam - bs ( see fig .",
