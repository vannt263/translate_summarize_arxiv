    "optical trapping provide three - dimensional confinement and manipulation of microscopic particles by a focussed laser beam .",
    "optical trapping is a powerful and widespread technique , with the single - beam gradient trap ( also known as optical tweezers ) in use for a large number of biological and other applications .",
    "the trapping beam applies optical forces ( usually divided into a gradient force , acting towards areas of higher irradiance , and scattering forces , including absorption and reflection forces ) to the particle .",
    "the optical forces and torques result from the transfer of momentum and angular momentum from the trapping beam to the particle .",
    "various approximate methods such as geometric optics or rayleigh approximations are often used for the calculation of the optical forces .",
    "such approximate methods are not necessary , since electromagnetic scattering theory can be used for the calculation of forces , avoiding the limited ranges of applicability of the approximate methods .",
    "other forces will also affect the motion of the particle .",
    "the most important of these forces , gravity , bouyancy , and viscous drag as the particle moves through the surrounding fluid , are readily taken into account .",
    "the optical forces and torques applied to the particle result from the transfer of momentum and angular momentum from the trapping beam to the particle .",
    "the total momentum transfer can be found by solving the electromagnetic scattering problem .",
    "a variety of numerical methods can be used  finite element method , fdtd , discrete dipole approximation  @xcite , the t - matrix method  @xcite , etc .",
    "a number of these have been used for optical force calculations , including forces in optical traps  @xcite .",
    "one method , however , stands out as ideal for trapping force calculations  the t - matrix method .",
    "the t - matrix method can be considered an extension of mie theory to arbitrarily shaped particles with arbitrary illumination .",
    "the main advantage of the t - matrix method is that trapping calculations usually involve repeated calculation of the scattering for the same particle under differing illumination . in this case , the t - matrix need only be calculated once , since it is independent of the fields , whereas methods such as fem , fdtd and dda will require the entire calculation to be repeated .    in the t - matrix method ,",
    "the incident trapping field illuminating the particle is expressed as a sum of regular vector spherical wave functions ( vswfs ) : @xmath0 & & \\label{incidentfield}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 @xmath2        \\mathbf{b}_{mn}(\\theta ) \\right\\ } , & & \\label{rgn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 are spherical bessel functions , and @xmath8 are wigner @xmath9 functions .",
    "similarly , the scattered fields are expressed as a vswf expansion . in this case , since the far field must be an outgoing radiation field , @xmath10 & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the same as @xmath13 and @xmath14 , with the spherical bessel functions replaced by spherical hankel functions of the first kind , @xmath15 .    from the linearity of the maxwell equations ,",
    "there is a linear relationship between the incident and scattered fields : @xmath16 @xmath17 the t - matrix can be calculated using the extended boundary condition method ( ebcm )  @xcite . for",
    "spherical particles , the t - matrix becomes diagonal , and the non - zero elements are the usual mie coefficients . for",
    "rotationally symmetric particles , the t - matrix is diagonal with respect to @xmath18 .",
    "computer codes to calculate t - matrices for such rotationally symmetric particles are available  @xcite .",
    "the use of the t - matrix method for scattering calculations requires that the trapping beam be represented in terms of vector spherical wave functions , that is , the coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 in equation  ( [ incidentfield ] ) need to be found .",
    "the regular vswfs @xmath21 and @xmath22 provide a complete set of modes or partial waves , each individually satisfying the maxwell equations , which can be used to represent any incident electromagnetic wave . for the simple case of a plane wave , @xmath23 , with @xmath24 in the direction @xmath25 , the expansion coefficients are  @xcite @xmath26 @xmath27 note that the amplitude vector @xmath28 contains the information regarding the polarisation and phase of the wave , and can be complex .    in an optical trap ,",
    "the incident field is usually a strongly focussed gaussian or other beam . in principle",
    ", such a beam can either be decomposed directly into a vswf representation , or into a plane wave spectrum , from which the vswf expansion coefficients can be found using equations ( [ planea ] ) and ( [ planeb ] ) . in practice , this is problematic , since the usual descriptions of beams do not actually satisfy the maxwell equations .    for the case of gaussian beams , either plane wave expansion",
    "@xcite or direct vswf expansion  @xcite can be used , although neither will give a beam identical to a traditional gaussian beam .",
    "using the t - matrix method , with the t - matrix calculated by the publically available code by mishchenko  @xcite , and the beam shape coefficients in the localised approximation by gouesbet  @xcite used to describe the beam , we calculated the variation of the axial force acting on particles of varying shape as a function of their position along the beam axis .",
    "the particles are polystyrene ( @xmath29 ) prolate spheroids and cylinders , of varying aspect ratio as indicated ( see figure  [ particles ] ) .",
    "the particles are of equal volume , with a volume equal to that of a sphere of radius 0.75@xmath30 m , and are trapped in water by a gaussian beam of waist width 0.8@xmath30 m and free space wavelength 1064 nm .",
    "the axial forces acting on the spheroids and cylinders are shown in figures  [ spheroids ] and [ cylinders ] .",
    "a negative position on the beam axis indicates a position before the focal plane is reached , a positive position is after the focus . a positive force acts to push the particle in the direction of propagation of the beam",
    ", a negative force will act to axially trap the particle .",
    "if only optical forces are acting , the particle will come to rest at the zero optical force position where force curve crosses the zero force line with a negative gradient .",
    "the trapping forces acting on the spheroid and cylinder with aspect ratio 1 is very small .",
    "this is due to interference due to reflections from the rear surface of the particle  @xcite .",
    "as the particles become smaller , the force becomes less dependent on the shape of the particle .",
    "even for the particles considered here , it can be seen that the fine details of the shape ( i.e. spheroid vs cylinder ) only has a small effect on the force .",
    "as the particle becomes more elongated , it obstructs less of the trapping beam , and radiation pressure forces are reduced .",
    "a number of non - optical forces will act on the particle .",
    "buoyancy and gravity are constant and are simply dealt with . motion of the particle in the surrounding fluid is completely dominated by viscous drag .    since the time required",
    "for the particle to reach its terminal velocity of @xmath31 is very short ( @xmath32 is typical ) , we use @xmath33 instead of @xmath34 , since the particle will be moving at very close to the terminal velocity at all times .",
    "if the fluid is in motion , we use the velocity of the particle relative to the fluid .",
    "since typical reynolds numbers in trapping are extremely low ( re  @xmath35 is typical ) , perfect laminar flow can be assumed  for a spherical particle , stoke s law will be an excellent approximation .    in general",
    ", the trapping beam will heat the surrounding medium , possibly giving rise to convective flow . while free convection is , in general ,",
    "a difficult problem , the convection problem in trapping is perhaps the simplest possible . due to the very small distances involved , the steady - state temperature distribution is reached in a very short time  @xcite , and a steady - state temperature distribution , _ independent of the convective flow _",
    ", can be assumed .",
    "similarly , any convective flow will reach steady - state very quickly .",
    "further effects that can be included for a complete model include brownian motion , thermophoretic effects due to uneven heating of the particle , the effects of nearby particles and surfaces , etc .",
    "accurate calculation of the optical forces can allow the evaluation of the accuracy of the modelling of these effects .",
