    "automatic repeat request ( arq ) uses retransmissions to recover data lost due to errors inevitable when transmitting over variable and unreliable channels .",
    "arq is based on the principle that the receiver can inform the transmitter about the transmission failure , to which the transmitter responds retransmitting the lost date ; arq used together with channel coding is known as hybrid arq ( harq ) @xcite .",
    "harq where we limit the number of allowed transmission attempts is known as truncated harq .    in this work ,",
    "we evaluate the throughput achievable in wireless links when using a truncated harq that conveys incremental , redundancy ( ir ) in subsequent transmission attempts .",
    "for such a harq - ir system , we use random coding and maximum likelihood decoding assumptions of @xcite@xcite@xcite . we adopt the same simple scenario where each transmission attempt is carried out over independently fading channel and we generalize the assumptions of @xcite allowing the transmission lengths ( or  rates ) to vary throughout the transmissions attempts .",
    "we show how to efficiently find the throughput - maximizing rates and we show gains obtained for a finite number of transmissions ( truncated harq ) .",
    "the idea of using variable - rate transmissions was already proposed and/or discussed in the literature but was not analyzed in the information - theoretic framework of @xcite , which sets the upper bounds on the performance of any practical scheme .",
    "for example , a general formulation of the problem was provided in @xcite which analyzed the infinite number of transmission attempts in abstraction of the channel model .",
    "the gains of variable - rate transmission over its fixed - rate counterpart for the predefined families of code were shown in @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . in @xcite@xcite",
    "the correlated fading was considered , while @xcite assumed that the channel stays constant for all transmission attempts .",
    "the idea of varying the transmission parameters appeared also in @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , where power was varied on a per transmission - attempt basis .",
    "we are interested here in the practical case of truncated harq when the packet loss ( outage ) can not be avoided .",
    "in such a case the throughput of harq may be optimized under constraints imposed on the outage probability @xcite@xcite or without such constraints @xcite@xcite ; the latter approach is also adopted in this paper .    in this work",
    "we analyze the `` conventional '' harq , i.e. , when the return channel can carry only one - bit ack / nack messages @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "if , on the other hand , we allow the return channel to carry more bits , then , the parameters ( rate or power ) can be _ adapted _ using such a `` rich '' or `` multi - level '' feedback , e.g. , @xcite@xcite@xcite . in the conventional case ,",
    "the _ adaptation _ is not possible but the transmission parameters ( rate or power ) can be _ allocated _ , that is , defined a priori for given channel conditions ( e.g. , the average snr ) ; this is focus of this work .    while power _ adaptation _ improves the throughput @xcite , the power _ allocation _ improves the diversity ( asymptotic value of the outage for high snr ) but yields significant gains in terms of throughput only in the low - snr range @xcite .",
    "such conclusions resemble those drawn in the context of adaptive modulation and coding @xcite or in information - theoretic analysis of water - filling @xcite . in this work ,",
    "interesting in medium - high snr region , we assume a constant - power transmission as the gains obtained when allocating the power are often small @xcite .    the objective of this work is thus to evaluate the benefits of constant - power , variable - rate transmission for truncated harq when compared to the fixed - rate case analyzed in @xcite and the main contributions are the following : a )  we show how to efficiently optimize the rates allocation for truncated harq with incremental redundancy , and b )  we asses the gains of variable - rate harq over its fixed - rate counterpart , showing that larger throughput , lower outage , and smaller average number of transmissions are yield .",
    "in the transmission system under study , information bits are separated into packets of equal length of @xmath0 bits , which are then encoded into codeword of @xmath1 complex symbols @xmath2 that are drawn randomly from the zero - mean complex gaussian distribution with unitary variance .",
    "the symbols and gathered into @xmath3 sub - codewords @xmath4 whose respective lengths are @xmath5 .",
    "we consider two ways of obtaining the sub - codewords :    1 .   a repetition coding ( rtc ) , where the symbols are picked consecutively starting always with @xmath6 @xmath7 , \\quad n_{{\\mathrm{s}},k}\\leq n_{\\mathrm{s}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this way , @xmath8 symbols are the same in the transmission attempts @xmath9 .",
    "2 .   an incremental redundancy ( ir ) transmission , where each sub - codewords is composed of different symbols @xmath10\\quad { \\mathrm{with}}\\quad t'_{k}=\\sum_{l=1}^{k-1}n_{{\\mathrm{s}},l}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this corresponds to puncturing of the codewords @xmath11 $ ] into @xmath3 distinct sub - codewords @xmath12 each of length @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 $ ] .    for convenience , we normalize the values of @xmath16 using @xmath17 , which has the meaning of the redundancy ( measured by the number of channel uses per transmitted bit ) and satisfy the relationship @xmath18 .",
    "we define also the rate of each transmission attempt @xmath19 and since the rate of the transmission attempts are not the same , we talk about variable - rate ( vr ) transmission , while if @xmath20 ( or @xmath21 ) we obtain the fixed - rate ( fr ) transmission considered before in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the arq process for each packet starts sending the sub - codeword @xmath22 .",
    "we assume that the feedback ( or , _ return _ ) error - free channel exists , which allows the receiver to send ( to the transmitter ) a one - bit message required by the arq process ( ack or nack ) .",
    "if the packet is not decoded correctly , the nack message is communicated by the receiver to the transmitter . upon reception of a nack message , knowing that the first sub - codeword was not decoded",
    "correctly , the transmitter sends a sub - codeword @xmath23 composed of @xmath24 symbols .",
    "after unsuccessful decoding , another nack message is generated to which the transmitter responds sending the codeword @xmath25 .",
    "this continues till the maximum allowed number of transmission attempts @xmath3 is reached ( truncated harq ) or until an ack message , denoting a successful decoding , is received .    in a particular case of @xmath26 ,",
    "the sub - codewords have the same length / rate and we recover the retransmission schemes analyzed in @xcite .    the channel remains constant during transmission of the @xmath27th sub - codeword @xmath28 and the received signal is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the vector of zero - mean complex , unitary - variance uncorrelated gaussian variables ( modelling noise ) .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) @xmath31 defines the channel state information ( csi ) which is perfectly known / estimated at the receiver , but unknown to the transmitter . snr does not change during the transmission of the sub - codeword but varies independently from one sub - codeword to another .",
    "this corresponds to a practical scenario where subsequent sub - codewords are not sent in adjacent time instants and , being sufficiently well separated , the realizations of the snr become  to all practical extent  independent .",
    "the channel gains @xmath32 are nakagami-@xmath33 distributed , so the snr is characterized by the gamma function ( pdf ) @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the average snr .",
    "the cumulative density function of snr is thus given by @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 are , respectively , the incomplete gamma function and the gamma function . the coding scheme is revealed to the transmitter , which in the @xmath27th transmission implements a maximum likelihood decoding using the observations @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "the system - level implementation of the variable - rate harq described above deserves some comments .",
    "namely , we may assume that each transmission contains only one sub - codeword in which case the duration of transmission attempts must vary .",
    "this might be a valid approach for a single - user communication where the transmitter and the receiver can negotiate the transmission time for each sub - codeword .",
    "on the other hand , it may be a questionable strategy in multi - user communications , where sharing the requirement for a variable - rate transmission with all the users is not practical",
    ". it might be possible to assign the resources ( time ) independently of the varying transmission length but it would lead to the bandwidth loss ( sub - codewords shorter than the assigned transmission time slot ) or to collisions ( sub - codewords longer than the available time ) .    to avoid such a conceptual difficulty , we assume that the sub - codewords corresponding to different packets are gathered in frames that have the duration of @xmath40 symbols .",
    "such an assumption , also used in @xcite allows us to deal with variable - rate codewords to fill up the frame and corresponds to tdma - type communication , where users are provided with a fixed transmission time ( frame ) .",
    "this is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : frame ] .",
    "we can easily see that the relative loss due to variable length of the sub - codewords can be made arbitrarily small , provided the number of packets in each frame is sufficiently large .",
    "the definition of the throughput we use here follows @xcite ; according to the _ reward - renewal _ theorem @xcite it is the ratio between the expected number of correctly received bits ( after up to @xmath3 transmissions ) and the expected number of channel uses @xmath41 required by the harq protocol to deliver the packet ( in up to @xmath3 transmission attempts ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath42 , the event of decoding failure in the @xmath27-th transmission and by @xmath43  the probability of decoding failure after @xmath27 transmission attempts .",
    "the throughput can be then expressed as @xcite@xcite @xmath44 which generalizes the results of @xcite to the case of transmission with variable sub - codewords lengths .",
    "note that @xmath45 has the meaning of `` harq outage '' , that is , the probability of loosing the data packet after the harq process is terminated .",
    "the formulation is entirely general and depends only on the model of the channel and on the coding / decoding scheme .",
    "for example , it was used in @xcite for convolutionally coded transmission while @xcite used it in independently block - fading channel assuming that capacity - achieving codes are available but under constraint @xmath46 . here",
    ", we remove this constraint but still follow the approach of @xcite that has the virtue of providing limits to any practical coding / decoding scheme .",
    "we thus assume that the coding / decoding scheme is `` capacity - achieving '' in the sense that the transmission is successful if the effective transmission rate is not greater than the accumulated mutual information between the sent and the received signals .",
    "is discussed , e.g. , in @xcite@xcite . ]",
    "this assumption as well as the way the transmitter / receiver deal with the retransmissions will affect the variables @xmath47 used in .",
    "namely , three harq schemes are considered :      in harq type - i ( harq - i ) , after @xmath27 transmissions , only the most recent received sub - codeword is used for decoding and others are discarded ( in @xcite this scheme was denoted as alo ) . in such a case ,",
    "the decoding failures are independent of each others and the probability of losing a packet after @xmath48 transmissions is calculated as @xcite @xmath49 where where @xmath50 is the average mutual information ( per channel use ) when transmitting with snr @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the probability of outage ( after a single transmission ) when transmitting with redundancy @xmath53 .",
    "the throughput of harq - i is then given by @xmath54 and the optimal throughput is denoted as @xmath55 .    [ prop : harq - i ] the maximal throughput of harq - i @xmath56 is independent of @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath57 where @xmath58 , and is yield with fixed - rate harq ( fr - harq - i ) @xmath59 . since @xmath60 , where the equality hold only for @xmath61 , we can use @xmath62 in , which yields the following inequality @xmath63 thus @xmath64 is the maximum throughout of vr - harq - i , achievable only if @xmath65 .    according to proposition  [ prop : harq - i ] ,",

    "alternatively , we may approximate @xmath74 by a gaussian variable,@xcite , i.e. , @xmath75 where @xmath76 are , respectively the mean of @xmath77 ( i.e. , the ergodic capacity ) , and the variance of @xmath77 .    since @xmath78 are independent , @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is a convolution of @xmath81 .",

    "[ sec : optimization ] .      instead of discarding the packets that were not decoded correctly ( as done in harq - i ) ,",
    "the receiver should take advantage of all received packets and if rtc is employed , the received signals should be weighted by the corresponding snr and added up .",

    "then , the decoder used the following signal @xmath94 where @xmath95 $ ] are zero - padded version of the received signal @xmath96 .",
    "the padding is used to make the notation compact and may be seen as an operation carried out at the receiver thus it does not affects the throughput .",
    "although , in the case of a fixed - rate harq , it was shown to introduce little gain over harq - i @xcite , chase - combining is the most the receiver can do when rtc is implemented at the transmitter so we deal with this case for completeness of our analysis .",
    "calculation of the decoding failure probability is slightly more involved in this case .",
    "first , for convenience , we reorder the variables @xmath97 so that the corresponding sub - codewords lengths after reordering are non - decreasing @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is a permutation of @xmath9 .",

    "consequently , chase combining may be seen as a form of ir transmission with redundancy @xmath111 and the probability of the decoding failure is given by @xmath112 that , in the case of a fixed - rate transmission , boils down to the formula shown in @xcite .",

    "this was tedious but feasible as it was done only for @xmath139 .    in case of vr - harq - ir ,",
    "different approach was adopted : instead of maximizing the throughput @xmath140 we maximizing the lower bound . the problem is greatly simplified since each term @xmath141 depends uniquely on @xmath85 and the optimization may be written as @xmath142 where @xmath143 and @xmath144    for a given @xmath145 , the minimization in is done over one variable ( @xmath146 ) provided the results of the minimization @xmath147 are known for all arguments @xmath145 .",
