    "a _ numbering _ of a set @xmath0 is a surjection from @xmath1 onto @xmath0 .",

    "representation _ of a set @xmath0 is a partial surjection from the baire space @xmath2 onto @xmath0 .",
    "representations are used to transfer the computability theory on @xmath3 to many structures of continuum cardinality .",
    "numbering theory was mostly systematized by the novosibirsk group of researchers in computability theory @xcite while representation theory was mostly systematized by the hagen group of researchers in computable analysis ( ca ) @xcite .",
    "although the analogy of representation theory to numbering theory is well known , there is a striking difference between them : numberings are in most cases total functions while representations considered so far are almost always partial functions ( among rare exceptions are section 1.1.6 of @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "note that total numberings have a better theory than partial numberings and are sufficient for many important topics like computable model theory ( although partial numberings also have some advantages , in particular the corresponding category is known to be cartesian closed while the category of total numberings is not ) .",
    "one might expect that total representations are also useful in some situations .    in this paper we argue in favor of total representations by elements of @xmath4 which we call just total representations ( trs ) .",
    "of course , similar to the numbering theory , some properties of partial representations are better than those of total representations . in particular , the category of sequential admissibly represented spaces is known to be cartesian closed @xcite while the corresponding category of sequential admissibly totally represented spaces is not ( see section [ admiss ] ) . on the other hand , the class of all sequential admissibly represented spaces",
    "is in a sense too large ( it coincides with the class of sequential @xmath5-spaces which are quotients of countably based spaces , and only few of such spaces are really interesting for ca ) .    from recent results of m.",
    "de brecht @xcite it follows that the countably based admissibly totally representable spaces coincide with the so called quasi - polish spaces ( see section [ admiss ] for details ) .",
    "this class of quasi - polish spaces is a good solution to the problem from @xcite of finding a natural class of spaces that includes the polish spaces and the @xmath1-continuous domains and has a reasonable descriptive set theory ( dst ) .",
    "note that while dst for countably based spaces is well understood , this is not the case for the non - countably based spaces .",
    "since some non - countably based spaces are quite important for computation theory and ca , the development of some dst for them seems very desirable .",
    "we hope that admissible totally represented spaces could be of use in such a developments ( see section [ admiss ] for additional remarks ) .",
    "as is well known , representation theory , in contrast to numbering theory , has a strong topological flavor .",
    "in fact , many notions of ca have two versions : computable and topological , the second being in a sense a `` limit case '' of the first .",
    "the topological version turns out to be fundamental for understanding many phenomena related to the computable version ; this is explained by the simple but important fact that computable functions between topological spaces are sequentially continuous @xcite . in this paper we are mainly concerned with the topological versions , only from time to time making comments on the computable versions .",
    "we have to warn the reader that trs are useful mostly for understanding the topological aspects of ca .    apart from ca , trs are useful also for other fields , in particular for the hierarchy theory . in sections [ princip ] and [ precomp ]",
    "we show that all levels of the most popular hierarchies in arbitrary countably - based spaces have principal trs ( a notion analogous to the corresponding notion from numbering theory ) which turn out to be acceptable and precomplete .",
    "this extends or improves some earlier facts from dst @xcite .",
    "note that hierarchies are also of primary interest to ca because they provide natural tools to measure the topological complexity ( known also as the discontinuity degrees @xcite ) of non - computable problems in ca .",
    "we also show in section [ princon ] that analogs of the main attractive properties of admissible representations hold for the so called principal continuous trs ( defined again by analogy to some notions from numbering theory ) .",
    "section [ admiss ] relates principal continuous trs with admissible ( partial ) representations which are very popular in ca . in section [ semilat ]",
    "we develop topological analogs of some results on computable numberings @xcite , this again demonstrates that topological analogs of results from computability theory are often easier .",
    "we include also some previous remarks on trs from @xcite .",
    "we also observe that such important notions of dst as the continuous and borel reducibilities of equivalence relations on the baire space are analogous to similar notions considered in the context of numbering theory .",
    "moreover , we show in section [ equiv ] that most of the natural substructures of the structure of continuous degrees of equivalence relations have undecidable first - order theories .",
    "this is done via establishing a close relation of this reducibility to a version of one of the weihrauch s reducibilities @xcite .",
    "thus , the results of this paper show that sticking to trs leads to some natural classes of spaces , makes the analogy between numberings and representations closer , unifies terminology , simplifies some technical details , suggests interesting open questions and new invariants of topological spaces relevant to ca .",
    "in contrast , total numberings seem to be less important than partial numberings in the study of effective theory of countable topological spaces @xcite . note that",
    ", though we do present quite a few apparently new results in the technical sections of this paper , we also give a reasonable space to discussing the analogy with numbering theory and to citing known facts which confirm our claim that trs deserve a special attention .    in section [ spaces ]",

    "we assume the reader to be familiar with basic notions of topology .",
    "the set of open subsets of a space @xmath7 is sometimes denoted @xmath21 .",
    "we often abbreviate `` topological space '' to `` space '' .",
    "a space @xmath7 is _ polish _ if it is countably based and metrizable with a metric @xmath22 such that @xmath23 is a complete metric space .",
    "a space @xmath7 is _ quasi - polish _ @xcite if it is countably based and quasi - metrizable with a quasi - metric @xmath22 such that @xmath23 is a complete quasi - metric space .",
    "quasi - metric _ on @xmath7 is a function from @xmath24 to the nonnegative reals such that @xmath25 iff @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "since for the quasi - metric spaces different notions of completeness and of a cauchy sequence are considered , the definition of quasi - polish spaces should be made more precise ( see @xcite for additional details ) .",
    "we skip these details because we will in fact use other characterizations of these spaces given in the sequel .",
    "let @xmath1 be the space of non - negative integers with the discrete topology .",

    "the space @xmath4 with this topology known as the _ baire space _ is of primary importance for dst and ca .",
    "the importance stems from the fact that many countable objects are coded straightforwardly by elements of @xmath4 , and it has very specific topological properties . in particular , it is zero - dimensional and the spaces @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 are homeomorphic to @xmath3 .",

    "the resulting space is known as _ cantor space _",
    "( more often the last name is applied to the space @xmath60 of infinite binary sequences ) .",
    "although in representation theory the baire and cantor spaces are equivalent as the sets of names , in the study of total representations baire space is more suitable .",
    "the reason is that cantor space is compact , hence all its continuous images are also compact .",
    "we also need the space @xmath61 of subsets of @xmath1 with the scott topology on the complete lattice @xmath62 .",
    "the basic open sets of this topology are of the form @xmath63 where @xmath64 runs through the finite subsets of @xmath1 .",
    "we conclude this section by recalling ( in a slightly generalized form ) a technical notion from dst .",
    "pointclass _ in @xmath7 is a subset of @xmath13 .",
    "a _ family of pointclasses _ is a family @xmath65 indexed by arbitrary spaces such that @xmath66 for any space @xmath7 , and @xmath67 for any @xmath68 and any continuous function @xmath12 .",

    "there are also two trivial examples of families @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 for any space @xmath7 .",
    "we define some operations on families of pointclasses which are relevant to hierarchy theory .",
    "first , we can use the usual set - theoretic operations pointwise .",
    "e.g. , the union @xmath78 of families @xmath79 is defined by @xmath80 .",
