    "the electrostatic coupling between the @xmath9 shell of rare earths having nonzero orbital angular momentum ( @xmath10 ) and its environment , known as crystalline electric field ( cef ) , greatly influences the physical properties of a rare earth system .",

    "nonmagnetic singlet ground state are of particular interest .",
    "the magnetic properties of such systems critically depend on the relative strength of the crystal electric field and the exchange field between the rare earth ions . the magnetic moment associated with the @xmath9 electrons",
    "can be completely quenched if the former dominates over the latter @xcite .",
    "no magnetic ordering can occur in singlet ground state system unless the exchange interaction @xmath13 exceeds a certain critical value relative to the crystal electric field splitting energy @xmath14 between the ground state and the excited state coupled by the matrix element @xmath15 @xcite . the critical value of @xmath13 for the case of singlet ground state and singlet first excited state is given by the condition @xmath16 @xcite .",

    "some of the singlet ground state pr - based systems are known to exhibit exotic behavior , such as the observation of unconventional heavy - fermion superconductivity in pros@xmath22sb@xmath23 @xcite .",
    "heavy fermion behavior in pros@xmath22sb@xmath23 is proposed to arise by an unconventional mechanism of the excitonic mass enhancement by low lying crystal field excitations . a similar mechanism is also believed to be the origin of the heavy fermion behavior in singlet ground state system prrh@xmath24b@xmath24c @xcite .",
    "in recent work on induced moment cef singlet ground state system prau@xmath24si@xmath24 , an interesting aspect of competition between the crystal electric field and exchange field was noted . a systematic study of the electronic ground state in prau@xmath19(si@xmath25ge@xmath26)@xmath19 revealed that the cef effect plays an important role in introducing a frustration to the magnetic ground state of the system @xcite .",

    "the exchange interaction in prau@xmath24si@xmath24 is found to be very close to the critical value required for the induced moment magnetic ordering .",
    "as such the dynamic fluctuations of cef levels destabilize the induced moment magnetism in prau@xmath24si@xmath24 leading to spin - glass behavior in this compound .",

    "here we report another cef - split singlet ground state system prirsi@xmath0 that exhibits a possible magnetically ordered ground state despite the dominant cef interaction and large splitting energy between the ground state and the first excited state .",
    "the physical properties of prirsi@xmath0 have been investigated by dc magnetic susceptibility @xmath27 , isothermal magnetization @xmath28 , thermo - remnant magnetization @xmath28 , ac magnetic susceptibility @xmath29 , specific heat @xmath30 and electrical resistivity @xmath31 as function of temperature @xmath32 and magnetic field @xmath33 .",
    "the magnetic ground state of prirsi@xmath0 is further probed by muon spin - relaxation ( @xmath7sr ) and inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) measurements .",
    "the @xmath1 shows a sharp anomaly due to magnetic phase transition at @xmath8  k. however , the @xmath5 data exhibit only a weak anomaly near 12  k. the @xmath7sr finds possible magnetic ordering below 30  k , apparently due to the presence of short range magnetic correlations well above the magnetic phase transition temperature .",
    "a singlet ground state is inferred both from @xmath5 and ins data .",
    "the ins spectra show two sharp inelastic excitations at 8.5  mev and 18.5  mev which are well represented by a cef model .",
    "the analysis of ins data reveal a very large cef splitting energy of 92  k between the ground state singlet and the first excited state doublet . as such the criterion of induced moment magnetism",
    "is not easily fulfilled in prirsi@xmath0 unless there is another kind of interaction in addition to the rkky interaction .",
    "thus , the observation of long range magnetic ordering in singlet ground state prirsi@xmath0 is very surprising and may bring further insight to the interplay of crystal field effect and exchange interaction in singlet ground state system .",

    "the sample was homogenized by flipping and re - melting several times .",
    "the arc melted buttons were wrapped in tantalum foil and annealed at 900 @xmath34c for a week under the dynamic vacuum .",
    "the phase purity and crystal structure of the sample was determined by the powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) using cu k@xmath35 radiation .",
    "the dc magnetization measurements were performed by using a commercial superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer ( mpms , quantum design inc . ) and the ac magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed by using a physical properties measurement system ( ppms , quantum design inc . ) .",

    "the single phase nature of the sample is evident from the refinement .",
    "a few weak impurity peaks are also present most of which could be accounted by two phase refinement , the impurity phase being prsi@xmath19 ( 1.35 wt% ) . during refinement",
    "the occupancies were kept fixed to unity and the thermal parameters @xmath42 were set to zero .",

    "the impurity phase prsi@xmath19 is reported to order ferromagnetically below 11  k followed by another transition at 7  k @xcite .",
    "the dc magnetic susceptibility of prirsi@xmath0 exhibits sharp anomaly at 12.2  k and a broad hump at 7.5  k ( figure  [ fig : chi - lowh ] ) which are very close to the transition temperatures of prsi@xmath19 .",
    "therefore , anomalies observed in magnetic data of prirsi@xmath0 may at first glance be naively connected with the traces of prsi@xmath19 .",
    "however , a closer look at the temperature dependence of the ac magnetic susceptibility , resistivity and specific heat of prsi@xmath19 and prirsi@xmath0 in the vicinity of transition show different behavior and the distinctness of magnetic behavior of prirsi@xmath0 is evident . the ac susceptibility of prsi@xmath19 shows two well pronounced peaks at 11  k and 7  k @xcite .",
    "in contrast the ac susceptibility of prirsi@xmath0 shows sharp peak at 12.2  k and a kink at 13.5  k , and there is no peak near 7  k. the isothermal magnetization of prsi@xmath19 exhibits a rapid increase up to 1.5  t whereas the isothermal magnetization of prirsi@xmath0 exhibits a rapid increase only up to 0.2  t. further , prsi@xmath19 which forms in thsi@xmath19-type tetragonal ( space group _ i4@xmath43/amd _ ) at room temperature undergoes a structural phase transition to gdsi@xmath19-type orthorhombic structure ( space group _ imma _ ) below 180  k and a well defined anomaly due to structural transition is observed in resistivity of prsi@xmath19 @xcite .",
    "however , no such anomaly is observed in our resistivity of prirsi@xmath0 ( see figure  [ fig : rho ] ) .",
    "furthermore in our inelastic neutron scattering spectra we do not see the reported @xcite excitations near 9.7  mev , 5.5  mev and 2  mev which would otherwise be due to the presence of prsi@xmath19 , suggesting that the contribution from the impurity phase is of no consequence .",
    "all of these lead to the compelling conclusion that our observed magnetic behavior is intrinsic to the title compound prirsi@xmath0 .",
