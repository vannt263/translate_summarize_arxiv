    "photons are suggested to be an ideal probe for the hot initial state of the relativistic heavy ion collisions , since , due to the large mean free path in a hadronic matter , they escape from the collision zone right after being emitted without any further interactions .",
    "unfortunately , photons emitted at early stages of the collision are difficult to obtain experimentally , since the decays of the final state hadrons , especially neutral pions and etas , dominate the production of photons in the collision .",
    "so far only the wa98 collaboration at the cern sps has reported an excess of photons over those originating from decays of the final state hadrons @xcite .",
    "photons are measured also by the phenix collaboration at brookhaven rhic collider , but more statistics is needed to reach conclusions @xcite .    in a hydrodynamical description of relativistic heavy ion collision the secondary interactions are assumed to lead to thermalization of the fireball . with this assumption , the evolution of the system can be described by equilibrium hydrodynamics and transverse momentum spectrum of the _ thermal photons _ emitted during the expansion can be calculated if thermal emission rate in the matter is known . experimentally measured _",
    "direct _ photon spectrum has a contribution from primary interactions as well @xcite , referred as pqcd ( or prompt ) photons in following .",
    "several groups @xcite have performed hydrodynamical studies to explain wa98 data .",
    "the authors of @xcite use a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional hydrodynamical code that takes into account also the finite longitudinal size of the initial collision zone , whereas the studies in @xcite are based on the boost - invariant approximation . in the boost - invariant scenario very hot initial state @xcite , considerable initial radial velocity @xcite or modification of hadron masses @xcite is needed to explain the wa98 data .",
    "i have made a choice to omit discussion on modifications of hadron masses @xcite and also chosen references @xcite to represent boost - invariant studies in this note .",
    "important improvements have been obtained in a perturbative calculation of the thermal emission rate of photons from the thermalized qgp @xcite . in hadron gas mesonic processes",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 , described with a pseudo - vector lagrangian , are included in the photon emission rate @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 scattering channel gets a large contribution from the interaction with the a@xmath3 axial meson : @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "parametrizations of the emission rates are provided by the authors of @xcite .",
    "the effects of baryons are not included in the rates .",
    "in section [ sps ] results of three different groups @xcite are compared to the wa98 data @xcite .",
    "groups @xcite use 2-loop photon emission rates in qgp @xcite while in @xcite resummed rate @xcite , complete in order @xmath5 , is used . in works",
    "@xcite contribution of the pqcd photons is taken from @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite present their own estimate for the pqcd photons .    in section [ rhic ] a prediction for direct photon spectrum in au@xmath6au collisions with @xmath7 agev",
    "results for hadronic observables in this study , where the initial state is based on perturbative qcd @xmath6 saturation model , can be found in @xcite . for this energy , hard pqcd photons from the primary interactions",
    "are studied in @xcite .",
    "the following discussion will concentrate on the role of the initial state in hydrodynamical models , since especially high transverse momentum @xmath8 part of the thermal photon spectrum is sensitive to the initial conditions .",
    "in particular , temperature @xmath9 in the initial state plays a big role due to the boltzmann suppression @xmath10 in the emission rates .      in boost - invariant",
    "hydrodynamical studies one must give the initial energy density @xmath11 and velocity @xmath12 distributions in the transverse plane at fixed formation ( thermalization ) time @xmath13 , that are the initial conditions for the hydrodynamical evolution . let us start with a case @xmath14 for all @xmath15 . for the shape of the initial energy density @xmath11 various choices can be found in the literature .",
    "for example , it can be proportional to wounded nucleon distribution @xcite , woods - saxon distribution @xcite or nuclear overlap function @xcite . within these choices ,",
    "the formation time @xmath13 remains as the main uncertainty in the boost - invariant picture . at sps energies",
    ", @xmath13 is expected to be @xmath16 fm / c based on the geometrical argument , that it takes a time @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the nuclear radius and @xmath19 the lorentz gamma - factor , for the colliding nuclei to pass through each other .",
    "fixing @xmath20 fm / c leaves only the normalization of the initial energy density as a free parameter , that can be fixed from experimentally measured hadron spectra .    .",
    "estimate for pqcd ( prompt ) photons is included to the curves.,height=207 ]    .",
    "estimate for pqcd ( prompt ) photons is included to the curves.,height=207 ]    studies by the authors of @xcite reveal a problem in this simple approach . if initial time is chosen to be of the order 1 fm / c , the initial state is way too cool to reproduce high transverse momentum , @xmath8 , part of the spectrum as measured by the wa98 collaboration . since decreasing of initial time",
    "considerably raises the temperature in the initial state for massless ideal gas . ] and final state hadron spectra are fairly insensitive to small changes of @xmath13 , the data seems to suggest very rapid thermalization and hot initial state within the boost - invariant scenario .",
    "figure [ fig : calcutta ] shows the main results in @xcite .",
    "the data is well reproduced with initial time @xmath21 fm / c which corresponds to an average initial temperature @xmath22 mev in their choice of the initial state .",
    "this temperature is considerably higher than the expected critical temperature @xmath23 mev from recent lattice calculations @xcite and hence the authors of @xcite conclude that this confirms the formation of the qgp .",
    "however , in my opinion , one should consider the initial time @xmath21 fm / c carefully , although the wa98 data seem to favor it .",
    "the geometrical argument above , on the transit time of the nuclei , suggests that at such a short initial time primary collisions are still taking place , and only part of the matter has been produced @xcite .",
    "let us turn to discuss effects from non - zero initial radial velocity .",
    "the authors of @xcite have studied the effects of radially increasing initial velocity @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is treated as a free parameter .",
    "they have performed a simultaneous @xmath26 analysis of @xmath27 and @xmath19 spectra measured by the wa98 collaboration @xcite to find the best combination of the thermalization time @xmath13 and the velocity parameter @xmath25 .",
    "their results @xcite with a phase transition to qgp are presented in figure [ fig : moscow ] .",
    "curves in the figure [ fig : moscow ] correspond to the choices of the initial parameters presented in the table [ tab : moscow ] .",
    ".choice of the initial parameters in @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     presented in the figure [ fig : rhic ] .",
    "increasing initial time from @xmath28 to 1.0 fm / c reduces the thermal emission by a factor of 20 at @xmath29 gev .",
    "unfortunately , the amount of thermal photons in this region may be hard to resolve experimentally , because pqcd photons from primary interactions may dominate the direct photon spectrum there .",
    "the analysis of the pqcd photons can be found in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the centrality cut is 10 % instead of 6 , so the pqcd results presented in the figure [ fig : rhic ] are multiplied with a factor of 1.1 @xcite .",
    "results for two different values of the intrinsic transverse momentum , @xmath30 and 2.4 gev@xmath31 , are given .",
    "these theoretical results on excess photons at rhic can be summarized as an upper limit given by the sum of the solid and dashed lines and a lower limit given by the sum of the dotted and dash - dotted lines .",
    "uncertainties are fairly large , but in any case one should see a change in the slope in the region @xmath32 gev , above which the pqcd photons start to dominate the spectrum . in principle a very clean data around @xmath33 gev could fix the value of the initial time , but one should keep in mind the possible effects from initial transverse velocity and longitudinal geometry discussed in the section [ sps ]",
    ". these effects may be smaller at rhic energies , because rapid thermalization means shorter time interval to build up the initial transverse velocity .",
    "also the rapidity range is broader at rhic , and hence scaling hydrodynamics should work better .",
    "i have reviewed hydrodynamical studies to explain the wa98 excess photon spectrum .",
    "the role of the initial state and the uncertainty in the values of initial temperature were emphasized in the discussion .",
    "the data can be explained with or without qgp phase transition , but high initial temperatures , well above the predicted critical temperature , are favored . in the case without boost - invariance the shape of the spectrum is closer to the data , when a phase transition is assumed .",
    "still , both theoretical and experimental uncertainties are somewhat too large to rule out either alternative .    using boost - invariant hydrodynamics with an initial state calculated from a pqcd + saturation model , theoretical estimates of the upper and lower limits for the thermal photons",
    "were given and compared with the results for the pqcd photons @xcite .",
    "the author is grateful to p.  v.  ruuskanen for discussions , p.  huovinen for comments and making the figures 3 and 4 , and a.  dumitru and l.  gerland for sending their results for pqcd photons .",
    "the author would like to thank the graspanp graduate school , funded by the ministry of education and the academy of finland , for financial support .",
