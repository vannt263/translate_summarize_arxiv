    "the eruption of v838  mon in 2002 ( brown 2002 ) and subsequent studies of its observed evolution ( munari et  al . 2002 ; kimeswenger et  al . 2002 ; crause et  al . 2003 ; kipper et  al . 2004 ; tylenda 2005 ) , as well as , of other similar objects , i.e. v4332 sgr ( martini et  al . 1999 ; tylenda et  al . , 2005 ) and m31  rv ( mould et  al . 1990 ) have led to suggestions that these observed events were likely to be due to stellar mergers ( soker & tylenda 2003 , tylenda & soker 2006 ) .",
    "soker & tylenda ( 2006 ) , who termed these events mergebursts , discuss the different channels to produce a mergeburst .    for hours to months after merger",
    "the merger product is very luminous ( e.g. , soker & tylenda 2003 ; bally & zinnecker 2005 ; tylenda 2005 ) . for a grazing collision ( namely , not a head on collision )",
    "an extended envelope is inflated by the merging stars . still on a longer time scale ,",
    "the mass loss process , both mass loss rate and geometry , is strongly influenced by the merger event ( e.g. morris & podsiadlowski 2006 ) . on a much later time of hundreds of years and longer ,",
    "after the merger products reaches equilibrium , the process can alter the evolution of the star on the hr diagram ( e.g. , podsiadlowski et al .",
    "1990 ) , like the formation of blue stragglers ( e.g. de marco et al . 2005 ; sills et al .",
    "2005 ) .    in the present study",
    "we examine whether and when the merger product can become magnetically active , a process that might be observed in the x - ray and radio bands .",
    "the parameter that best indicates the level of magnetic activity of main sequence stars ( e.g. , pizzolato et al .",
    "2003 ) , pre - main sequence stars ( e.g. , preibisch et al . 2005 ) , and subgiants ( or g giants ; e.g. , gondoin 2005 ) is the rossby number @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the rotation period of the star , @xmath4 is the convection overturn time , @xmath5 is the pressure scale hight , @xmath6 is the mixing length , and @xmath7 is the velocity of the convective cells . in particular , the correlations of some properties of the magnetic activity in main sequence stars with the rosbby number and the explanation of these in the frame of the @xmath8 dynamo model are well established ( e.g. , brandenburg et al .",
    "1988 ; saar & brandenburg 1999 ) .",
    "the subscript ` _ b _ ' in equation ( [ rossby ] ) indicates that the value of @xmath9 is calculated at the bottom ( inner boundary ) of the envelope convective region , or just above it . in stars having a fully convective envelope , e.g. , low mass main sequence stars , it is complicated to calculate @xmath10 . in that case",
    "one can define the global overturn time @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the stellar radius and @xmath13 is the radius at the bottom of the envelope convective region .",
    "kim & demarque ( 1996 ) find for main sequence stars the relation @xmath14 .",
    "we are interested in the x - ray emission resulting from magnetic activity .",
    "the magnetic flux on the surface of magnetically active main sequence stars is proportional to the x - ray luminosity @xmath15 ( e.g. , pevtsov et al .",
    "the ratio of the x - ray luminosity to the bolometric luminosity of main sequence stars has a general relation of @xmath16 @xmath17 saturates at a values of @xmath18 for @xmath19 , while no activity is detected for @xmath20 ( pizzolato et al .",
    "2003 ) . for main sequence stars @xmath21 ( pizzolato et al .",
    "2003 ) , while for g giants ( subgiants ) @xmath22 ( gondoin 2005 ) .",
    "ysos are usually in the saturated regime , and show higher activity than main sequence stars with the same mass or bolometric luminosity ( preibisch et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "following tylenda & soker ( 2006 ) we assume that the merger remnant is composed of a more or less undisturbed pre - merger primary star of mass , @xmath23 , and radius , @xmath24 , surrounded be an envelope of mass , @xmath25 , inflated up to an outer radius , @xmath26 .",
    "merger products are expected to contract more or less along the hayashi line ( tylenda 2005 ; tylenda & soker 2006 ) .",
    "however , they are different from young stellar objects ( ysos ) contracting along the hayashi line .",
    "an inflated merger product has a well defined and relaxed central region@xmath27the pre - merger primary star , while the contracting envelope contains a relatively small amount of mass .    in that respect ,",
    "the inflated merger remnants are more similar to late asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and post - agb stars ; both classes of objects share the following properties :    1 .",
    "radius of tens to hundreds solar radii .",
    "2 .   luminosity of @xmath28 .",
    "cool envelope , @xmath29 .",
    "4 .   extended convection region in the envelope . to compensate for the low density in the expression for convective energy transport",
    ", the convective velocity must be large .",
    "5 .   a low mass envelope with a compact massive center : the stellar core in late agb stars and post agb stars , and the primary in inflated merger products .",
    "based on these properties , we proceed as follows . to estimate the convective velocity @xmath7 we use results of late agb and post - agb stars ( soker & harpaz 1992 ; 1999 ) .",
    "these results show that just below the photosphere , where the temperature is @xmath30 , the convection velocity is @xmath31 . in the stellar numerical code",
    "the convection velocity is limited by the isothermal sound speed , because for higher convection velocities the dissipation is large , and the convective cells rapidly slow down .",
    "the value of @xmath7 stays at @xmath32 in most of the envelope .",
    "we will therefore take @xmath33 , and use the global convective overturn time as defined in equation ( [ global ] ) . using @xmath14 ( kim & demarque 1996 ) , and @xmath34 ,",
    "we take for merger remnants @xmath35    a similar result is obtained if we consider , following tylenda ( 2005 ) , the envelope of the merger product to be an @xmath36 polytrope , and calculate @xmath9 at the middle of the envelope @xmath37 . in an @xmath36 envelope the pressure scale hight has its maximum value of @xmath38 at the middle of the envelope . taking for the ratio of mixing length to pressure scale hight @xmath39 ( kim & demarque 1996 ) would give @xmath40  days . on the other hand , our estimate of @xmath7 might be too large , with an underestimate of @xmath9 , as pre - main sequence stars have @xmath41  day ( preibisch et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the inflated envelope of the merger remnant stores an angular momentum comparable to that of the pre - merger orbital motion of the secondary . for an @xmath36 polytropic envelope having @xmath42 the moment of inertia can be approximated as @xmath43 .",
    "we assume that after several dynamical time scales the convection in the envelope brings the envelope to a solid body rotation . assuming that the secondary had a keplerian velocity as it collided with the primary at radius @xmath24 and that the merger product envelope has a mass comparable to that of the secondary",
    ", we can estimate a rotation period of the envelope as @xmath44 equivalently we can define a parameter @xmath45 being the ratio of the envelope rotation velocity to the keplerian velocity @xmath46(or keplerian period @xmath47 to rotation period ) at @xmath26 , namely @xmath48 the second equality uses equation ( [ prot1 ] ) .    as it is clear from the above equations , when the remnant contracts , it spins - up .",
    "we assume that after it reaches a rotation velocity of some fraction @xmath49 of its break - up ( keplerian ) velocity mass loss keeps the value of @xmath45 unchanged .",
    "when it happens , the rotation period is @xmath50    the rossby number ( eq . [ rossby ] ) for the inflated merger remnant can be obtained from equation ( [ taucm ] ) using equations ( [ prot1 ] ) or ( [ prot2 ] ) , i.e. @xmath51 if equation ( [ eta ] ) gives @xmath52 or @xmath53 otherwise .",
    "as the merger products are somewhat similar to giant stars , we should take @xmath54 in equation ( [ lxlb ] ) ( gondoin 2005 ) .",
    "the operation of an @xmath8 dynamo in the envelope of agb stars that were spun - up by low mass companions spiraling inside their envelope was considered before ( nordhaus & blackman 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "however , agb stars that are expected to rotate very slowly and have large rossby number @xmath55 ( soker & zoabi 2002 ) , do amplify magnetic fields , as evidenced by polarization of maser emission in local regions around these stars ( szymczak 1998 ; vlemmings 2005 ) . in",
    "seems as if a dynamo based mainly on convection , and not on convection+rotation ( the @xmath56 dynamo model ) , can also amplify magnetic fields in giants ( soker & zoabi 2002 ; soker & kastner 2003 ; dorch 2004 ) , but not as efficiently as the @xmath8 dynamo we appeal to here .",
    "therefore , although our envelope model is similar to that of agb stars , the dynamo model we use is much more efficient than that expected in agb stars . by taking @xmath54 we might underestimate the x - ray luminosity of merger remnants . using equation ( [ rom1 ] ) or ( [ rom2 ] ) in equation ( [ lxlb ] ) with @xmath54",
    "we find the expected x - ray luminosity of the contracting envelope @xmath57 if equation ( [ eta ] ) gives @xmath52 , or @xmath58 otherwise .",
    "we can apply the general derivation of the previous section to predict the expected evolution of the x - ray luminosity of v838 mon .    as discussed in tylenda ( 2005 ) the observed decline in flux of v838 mon after its eruption",
    "can be well described by gravitational contraction of a low - mass inflated envelope sitting on top of an early b - type main sequence star .",
    "assuming more recent determinations of the distance to v838  mon giving a value of @xmath59  kpc ( sparks et  al .",
    "2007 ; bond & afsar 2007 ) ( compared to 8  kpc assumed in tylenda 2005 ) the parameters of the model fitted to the observed decline become : @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 . at the beginning of the contraction ( august - september 2002 ) the envelope radius was @xmath63 .",
    "using the same approach as in tylenda ( 2005 ) and the above parameters , we can follow the contraction of the v838  mon remnant to obtain the evolution of @xmath26 and @xmath64 with time .",
    "this allows us to predict from the relations derived in section [ model ] the evolution of the x - ray luminosity .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ lumx ] .    , the maximum ratio of rotation velocity to keplerian velocity on the equator .",
    "dotted parts indicate the time period when the rossby number is @xmath65 , where the @xmath8 dynamo model is less efficient.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the curves show the evolution of the x - ray luminosity with time and are labelled with the value of @xmath49 used when caluculating the luminosity from equations ( [ lxm1 ] ) and ( [ lxm2 ] ) .",
    "the rising parts of the two upper curves correspond to the initial , constant angular momentum phase of the remnant contraction ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the declining parts show the phase when the envelope is loosing angular momentum via mass loss so that the condition @xmath66 is kept .",
    "the dotted parts of the curves show the periods when the rossby number is greater then 5 .",
    "we expect that during this period the dynamo is less effective than assumed in our estimates so our results may overestimate the x - ray luminosity .    with _ chandra _",
    "23 hours of observations of the orion nebula , at a distance of @xmath67 , feigelson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) could detect sources with luminosity down to @xmath68 . for a distance of @xmath69 to v838 mon ( sparks et  al .",
    "2007 ; bond & afsar 2007 ) , and with a similarly long observation , we expect to detect any emission if @xmath70 .",
    "we conservatively took @xmath54 in equation ( [ lxlb ] ) , as appropriate for subgiants ( gondoin 2005 ) rather than @xmath71 as appropriate for main sequence stars ( pizzolato et al .",
    "more than that , bright pre main sequence stars with no accretion disk are x - ray brighter than those with disks ( preibisch et al . 2005 ) . as v838 mon",
    "does not have an accretion disk , it is quite possible that we underestimate the x - ray luminosity of merger products in equations ( [ lxm1 ] ) and ( [ lxm2 ] ) by up to an order of magnitude .",
    "therefore , it is quite possible that 10 hours of xmm - newton or _ chandra _ observation could detect x - rays from v838  mon at present and in coming years .",
    "v838 mon was observed with _",
    "chandra _ for @xmath72 a year after its outburst by orio et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) who were able to put only an upper limit of @xmath73 . with a distance of @xmath59  kpc",
    "this corresponds to @xmath74 which is well above our predictions .",
    "according to the stellar merger model of the v838 mon outburst and similar merger products ( which we term mergebursts ) , a large envelope is formed around the more massive of the two merging stars .",
    "the envelope then contracts on a thermal time scale .",
    "the merger remnant should become a fast rotator as it contracts . as the remnant contracts more or less along the hayshi line , its envelope possesses a large convective region .",
    "the fast rotation and the envelope convection are the two ingredients required in the @xmath8 dynamo model@xmath27a successful model for magnetic activity of main sequence stars , pre - main sequence stars , and subgiants .",
    "we applied the @xmath8 model to contracting merger products by using the rossby number ( eq . [ rossby ] ) , and the relation between the rossby number and x - ray luminosity known for magnetically active stars , scaled according to the expression for subgiant ( or g giant ) stars ( eq . [ lxlb ] ) .",
    "we also assumed that after the contracting product reaches some fraction @xmath49 of its break - up ( keplerian ) velocity , this ratio does not increase any more , because a stellar wind removes angular momentum from the envelope .",
    "our final ( and conservative ) prediction for the x - ray luminosity of magnetically active merger products are given by equation ( [ lxm1 ] ) for merger products before they reach our assumed maximum rotation rate , and by equation ( [ lxm2 ] ) for merger products rotating at @xmath49 .",
    "in section [ v838 ] we apply the results to our model of v838 mon .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ lumx ] for three values of the assumed maximum rotating rate @xmath49 , as marked near the lines . for too large rossby numbers @xmath20 ( pizzolato et al .",
    "2003 ; we here take a stronger constraint of @xmath75 ) of the @xmath8 dynamo is not efficient any more .",
    "the dotted lines are the evolutionary stages where the expected rossby number of v838 mon is @xmath76 , and we expect no strong magnetic activity .      1 .",
    "there is no magnetic activity at the first several years , and hence no x - ray emission is expected .",
    "the observation by orio et al .",
    "( 2003 ) was made a year after the outburst , when no magnetic activity and no x - ray emission is expected .",
    "2 .   for a reasonable values of maximum rotation rate @xmath77",
    ", v838 mon will reach a maximum activity at 6 - 8 years after outburst .",
    "the expected x - ray luminosity then slowly declines .",
    "3 .   the x - ray luminosity in the coming years will be @xmath0 . at the distance of v838",
    "mon the expected x - ray flux is @xmath78 .",
    "we estimate that with 100,000 seconds of observation this emission can be detected .",
    "we therefore highly encourage 100,000 seconds of x - ray observation of v838 mon in 2008 . even if no x - ray is detected , the results is of some importance , as it can strongly constrain models for v838 mon , e.g. , rules out accreting white dwarf .",
    "orio et al .",
    "( 2003 ) noted that their null detection rules our a symbiotic - like event to the v838 mon outburst .",
    "we point out that the null detection of x - ray emission from two agb stars ( kastner & soker 2004 ) is not directly relevant to the case of v838 mon .",
    "first , and most important , our prediction is based on the @xmath8 dynamo model , namely , the amplification of the magnetic field by the operation of both rotation and convection , which is known to be very efficient . on the other hand , predictions for agb stars",
    "are based on the amplification of the magnetic field by convection alone ( soker & zoabi 2002 ) , which is thought to be much less efficient .",
    "second , v838 mon is an order of magnitude more massive than an upper agb star .",
    "we predict the magnetic activity to take place when the radius , luminosity and temperature of v838 mon is similar to that of upper agb star . due to the higher mass we expect the mass loss rate to be smaller , and the wind speed to be faster .",
    "therefore , the column density to the expected x - ray emitting region will be much lower .",
    "finally , the magnetic fields might be detected also in masers spots .",
    "deguchi ( 2005 ) and claussen ( 2005 ) report the detection of sio maser around v838 mon .",
    "we predict that if maser emission , in sio , h@xmath79o , or oh , will be observed from 2007 , some regions might show polarization indicating the presence of magnetic fields , similar to the case around agb stars , e.g. , vlemmings et al .",
