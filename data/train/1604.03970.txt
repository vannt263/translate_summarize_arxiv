    "the topic of parity - time ( @xmath9 ) symmetry and its relevance for physical applications on the one hand , as well as its mathematical structure on the other , have drawn considerable attention from both the physics and the mathematics community .",
    "originally the proposal of bender and his collaborators @xcite towards the study of such systems was made as an alternative to the postulate of hermiticity in quantum mechanics . in view of the formal similarity of the schrdinger  equation with maxwell s equations in the paraxial approximation",
    ", it was realized that such @xmath9 invariant systems can in fact be experimentally realized in optics @xcite .",
    "subsequently , these efforts motivated experiments in several other areas including @xmath9 invariant electronic circuits @xcite , mechanical circuits @xcite , and whispering - gallery microcavities @xcite .",
    "concurrently , the notion of supersymmetry ( susy ) originally espoused in high - energy physics has also been realized in optics @xcite .",
    "the key idea is that from a given potential one can obtain a susy partner potential with both potentials possessing the same spectrum ( with exception of possibly one eigenvalue ) @xcite .",
    "an interplay of susy with @xmath9 symmetry is expected to be quite rich and is indeed useful in achieving transparent as well as one - way reflectionless complex optical potentials @xcite .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we explored the interplay between @xmath9 symmetry , susy and nonlinearity . in ref .",
    "@xcite we derived the exact solutions of the general nonlinear schrdinger  equation ( nlse ) with arbitrary nonlinearity in 1 + 1 dimensions when in an external potential given by a shape invariant @xcite supersymmetric and @xmath9 symmetric complex potential .",
    "in particular , we considered the nonlinear partial differential equation @xmath10 for arbitrary nonlinearity parameter @xmath3 , with @xmath11 and the partner potentials arise from the superpotential @xmath12 giving rise to    [ vpvm ] @xmath13    for @xmath14 , the _ complex _ potential @xmath15 has the same spectrum , apart from the ground state , as the _ real _ potential @xmath16 and we used this fact in our numerical study of the stability of the bound state solutions of the nlse in the presence of @xmath15 ( see ref .",

    "because the nlse in the presence of @xmath16 is a hamiltonian dynamical system , we can use variational methods to study the stability of the solutions when they undergo certain small deformations .",
    "we will compare the results of this type of analysis with a linear stability analysis based on the v  k stability criterion @xcite .    in our previous paper",

    "we note that @xmath16 has the symmetry @xmath19 , so that we can obtain @xmath16 from two _ different _ superpotentials @xmath20 and @xmath21 that have the @xmath0 symmetric forms at arbitrary @xmath22 :    [ ssw1w2 ] @xmath23    in particular , when @xmath14 we can determine the spectrum of bound states of the linear schrdinger  equation with potential @xmath16 using the _ real _ superpotential @xmath24 and the real shape invariant sequence of partner potentials . when @xmath14 the first superpotential @xmath20 has the _ complex _ partner potential @xmath15 which we studied in @xcite , whereas @xmath25 is the usual _ real _ shape invariant susy potential .",

    "the results of the v ",
    "k analysis agree with the new regime of stability found from derrick s theorem and the time dependent variational approach .",
    "the latter approach allows us to obtain the frequency of small oscillations of the perturbed solutions .",
    "we are able to obtain exact analytic results because we can formulate the problem in terms of hamilton s action principle .",
