    "all bodies are surrounded by a fluctuating electromagnetic field , due to the random motion of charges inside a body . when a second body is placed in the vicinity of the first one , fluctuation - induced ( casimir - lifshitz",
    ") forces appear between the bodies .",
    "these forces are of great relevance in chemistry , nanotechnology and biology @xcite .",
    "much of the recent work on the fluctuation - induced forces , as well as on the related phenomena of near field heat transfer and the noncontact friction , deals with systems out of equilibrium ( for some reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "one should distinguish among several out - of - equilibrium situations :    1 .",
    "different parts of the system have different temperatures but there is no relative motion between those parts ( a hot body embedded into the cold environment is the simplest example of such situation @xcite ) .",
    "under such conditions the casimir - lifshitz forces will be modified , as compared to their equilibrium value @xcite.[enu : different - parts - of-1 ] 2 .",
    "different parts of the system are in relative motion . for instance , two macroscopic plates , separated by a vacuum gap , move one on top of the other . another example is an atom ( or a nanoparticle ) moving above a macroscopic plate .",
    "relative motion between bodies affects the casimir - lifshitz forces and , in particular , leads to dissipation and noncontact friction .",
    "this kind of problems was considered by many authors ( @xcite and references therein ) , with rather controversial results ( see ref @xcite for various contradictions and inconsistencies in the literature).[enu : different - parts - of ] 3 .",
    "there is no relative motion between parts of the system but some of the parts are subjected to a dc electric current @xcite .",
    "the simplest example is to consider a semiconducting plate , with a dc current flowing in it , and ask how this current affects fluctuations of the electromagnetic field inside and outside the plate .",
    "this problem has been considered in @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we further elaborate on electromagnetic field fluctuations in the presence of carrier drift and , in particular , calculate the fluctuation force acting on an atom , or a nanoparticle placed above a sample with a dc current in it.[enu : there - is - no ]    let us stress that setups [ enu : different - parts - of ] and [ enu : there - is - no ] are quite different- a fact not sufficiently appreciated in the literature . for one thing , the dc current in the sample produces a stationary ( time independent ) magnetic field which affects the atomic spectrum and , if inhomogeneous , exerts a force on the atom as a whole .",
    "more importantly , the fluctuation - induced forces in the two setups are not the same .",
    "the point is that in setup [ enu : there - is - no ] the mobile carriers are in motion ( in the laboratory frame ) while the lattice is fixed .",
    "therefore the spontaneous fluctuations originating in the sub - system of the mobile carriers will be doppler shifted with respect to those residing in the lattice .",
    "moreover , in the presence of drift it is generally not even possible to assign a definite temperature to the mobile carriers , which makes the existing theory of the fluctuation - induced forces inapplicable .",
    "the purpose of this work is to study the effect of carrier drift on the fluctuation forces exerted on a small polarizable object ( an atom , molecule or a nanoparticle ) .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section ii we define the model and discuss how the fluctuational electrodynamics ( rytov s theory ) should be modified in the presence of mobile carrier drift .",
    "section iii is devoted to the properties of the fluctuating field , outside the sample with drifting carriers .",
    "in section iv a particle is introduced , above the surface of a medium with drifting carriers , and the forces acting on the particle ( both in the lateral and in the normal direction ) are calculated .",
    "various specific examples are presented in section v and the conclusions are summarized in section vi .",
    "we consider a conducting medium , e.g. , a semiconductor , containing mobile carriers with charge @xmath0 , effective mass @xmath1 and equilibrium concentration @xmath2 . when a dc voltage is applied to the sample ,",
    "the carriers acquire some drift velocity @xmath3 , so that there is a steady state dc current @xmath4 . on top of this stationary drift",
    "there are fluctuations of the carrier and current density which cause fluctuations of the electric field .",
    "we designate the fluctuating part of these quantities as @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "thus , for instance , the total current density is @xmath8 .",
    "the fluctuating part @xmath7 of the electric field is of particular interest because , unlike @xmath9 and @xmath10 , it exists also outside the sample and exerts forces on nearby objects .",
    "it should be emphasized that @xmath6 accounts only for the motion of the mobile carriers .",
    "in addition , there are fluctuating polarization currents due to the lattice .",
    "we briefly recapitulate the main equations of the theory , following with some modifications ref @xcite .",
    "the relation between @xmath10 and @xmath11 , in the frequency - wavevector domain is @xmath12 where summation over @xmath13 is implied .",
    "the conductivity tensor @xmath14 is defined with respect to the non - equilibrium steady state , i.e. , it connects quantities fluctuating on top of the stationary current flow .",
    "that is why , even for an intrinsically isotropic medium , @xmath14 is a tensor depending not only on @xmath15 but also on @xmath16 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath16 occurs because the fluctuations are carried away by the flow , thus producing a non - local response ( spatial dispersion ) . adding the conduction current , eq ( [ ohm ] ) , to the fluctuating polarization current of the lattice yields the fluctuating displacement @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the lattice dielectric function which can depend on @xmath15 but not on @xmath16 .",
    "eq ( [ displacement ] ) defines the dielectric tensor @xmath19 which controls the dynamics of electrical fluctuations in the medium .",
    "the form of @xmath19 depends on the specific system or model .",
    "we assume here drude model , with drift , which is a special case of the more general hydrodynamic model ( see eq(11 ) of @xcite with the thermal pressure term neglected ) : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the collision frequency of the mobile carriers , @xmath22 , and @xmath18 has been separated into the real and imaginary parts .    in our dealing with fluctuations we use rytov s method in which random langevin sources are introduced into the maxwell equations , similarly to what is done in the theory of brownian motion .",
    "these random sources play the role of `` external '' currents and charges in the maxwell equations and , if their correlation functions are known , one can compute the correlation function for various components of the electromagnetic field .",
    "we shall be interested in fluctuational phenomena close to the surface of the sample and neglect the retardation effects . in this limit",
    "the electromagnetic field is rotationless , @xmath23 , and rytov s fluctuational electrodynamics reduces to the poisson equation supplemented by the langevin sources . in the bulk of the sample",
    "this equation is @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 are the fourier transforms @xcite of the potential @xmath27 and of the random langevin sources @xmath28 , and @xmath29 this expression has a simple interpretation .",
    "the dielectric function @xmath30 relates the displacement and the field in a longitudinal wave .",
    "if the wave propagates in the direction of flow , @xmath31 , then there is a doppler shift of the wave frequency .",
    "there is no such shift if the propagation direction is perpendicular to @xmath3 .",
    "note that only the plasma component of @xmath30 undergoes the doppler shift , while the lattice component remains the same as in equilibrium .    for a system at equilibrium ( @xmath32 ) the correlation function of the random sources",
    "is determined by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite : @xmath33 with @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes thermal and quantum average , @xmath36 is the temperature of the system and @xmath37 is the imaginary part of its dielectric function [ eq ( [ epsilons ] ) with ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "eq ( [ corr ] ) defines the spectral densities @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and eq ( [ fdt ] ) contains the essence of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem . strictly speaking , @xmath41 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , etc .",
    ", should be understood as quantum - mechanical operators and various correlation functions should be properly antisymmetrized .",
    "these changes , however , would be only cosmetic and would not affect the final results .",
    "the point is that in the rhs of eq ( [ fdt ] ) the correct quantum mechanical spectral density is given . with this ceavet ,",
    "rytov s theory becomes essentially classical @xcite .",
    "since our system is out of equilibrium ( @xmath42 ) , there is no general prescription for writing down the correlator of the random sources @xmath26 .",
    "however , under some conditions , it is possible to do so .",
    "for instance , if dissipation in the system of the mobile carriers can be neglected ( the limit of collisionless plasma ) , then the random sources originate only in the lattice .",
    "since the latter is in equilibrium , at some temperature @xmath43 , one can use the fluctuation - dissipation theorem so that@xcite @xmath44 in this case the spontaneous creation of the fluctuations is not sensitive to the drift of the mobile carriers . only the subsequent dynamics of the fluctuations , which is governed by the full dielectric function , [ eq",
    "( [ epsilons ] ) with @xmath45 ] , is affected by the drift .",
    "one can envisage the opposite situation when the lattice is `` noiseless '' , i. e. , @xmath46 , and the fluctuating sources reside only in the plasma .",
    "this requires , of course , @xmath21 being different from zero .",
    "since the electron plasma is out of equilibrium , it can not be generally described by a well defined temperature . in some cases",
    ", however , the plasma is in a state of internal equilibrium , in spite of its overall drift .",
    "this happens , for instance , at low drift velocities , when the electron distribution is close to fermi - dirac ( or bolzmann ) , with the temperature of the lattice .",
    "the more interesting example is the case of large drift velocities when , due to strong mutual interactions , the electronic system undergoes rapid internal thermalization , with a temperature higher than that of the lattice ( `` hot electrons '' ) .",
    "if the condition of internal equilibrium with some temperature @xmath47 is satisfied , then one can still use the fluctuation - dissipation theorem . in this case",
    "the creation of fluctuations is controlled by the imaginary part of the last term in eq ( [ epsilons ] ) . denoting this term by @xmath48 , where @xmath49 , we can write the fluctuation - dissipation theorem as @xmath50    the important difference between the eqs ( [ corra ] ) and ( [ corrb ] ) , besides the trivial replacement of @xmath51 , @xmath52 by @xmath53 , @xmath47 , is that the frequency @xmath54 appears in eq ( [ corrb ] ) , i. e. , the spontaneous creation of the fluctuations is now affected by the drift : the frequency of the fluctuations , as measured in the laboratory frame , is doppler shifted .",
    "let us note in this context that the total dielectric function , eq ( [ epsilons ] ) , even for @xmath46 , is _ not _ a function of @xmath54 only .",
    "this is because @xmath55 depends on the `` bare '' frequency @xmath15 , not on the doppler shifted @xmath54 .",
    "therefore even for a noiseless lattice the problem of fluctuations in the presence of carrier drift is not equivalent to that for a moving sample . only if one makes the additional assumption that @xmath56 do the two problems become equivalent ( provided that the drifting electrons are in an internal equilibrium , which is in itself a rather strong assumption ) .",
    "later , when considering the phenomena near a planar surface of the medium , we shall need eq ( [ pois ] ) in a somewhat different form . assuming that the velocity vector @xmath3 is in the @xmath57 - plane ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath30 does not depend on @xmath58 , we can transform eq ( [ pois ] ) back to space , in the @xmath59 direction , obtaining @xmath60 where @xmath61 denotes the transverse ( in - plane ) wave vector and @xmath62 is the fourier transform of @xmath63 with respect to time and the @xmath64 - coordinates ( the same for @xmath41 ) .",
    "this @xmath65-representation is convenient for handling the planar geometry .",
    "the spectral densities of the random sources , eqs ( [ fdt],[corra],[corrb ] ) , should be also transformed to the @xmath65-representation .",
    "for instance , eq ( [ corra ] ) becomes @xmath66\\\\ \\times\\epsilon_{l}^{\\prime\\prime}\\left(\\omega\\right)\\coth\\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{2t_{l}},\\label{corra'}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] and similarly for the other spectral densities .",
    "we consider a medium occupying half space @xmath67 while the other half @xmath68 is vacuum .",
    "the random charge sources @xmath28 produce evanescent electric fields near the surface ( in addition to the radiation which we do not consider within our quasi - stationary , non - retarded approximation ) and we are interested in various correlation functions for the potential and field",
    ". we shall consider three different setups , see fig 1 .",
    "although case ( a ) has been studied long ago @xcite and case ( b ) is simply related to ( a ) , we discuss briefly also these two cases .",
    "the correlation functions obtained in this section will serve as building blocks in calculation of the fluctuation - induced forces in the next section .",

    "the fourier transform from @xmath83 to @xmath84 immediately yields @xmath85 the correlation function @xmath86 is obtained from ( [ phycorrc ] ) by multiplying it by the factor @xmath87 .",
    "this is the general rule , for any pair of fluctuating variables , and it follows from the stationary character of the fluctuations .",
    "correlation functions for various components of the electric field can be obtained from eq ( [ phycorrc ] ) by differentiation .",
    "some examples can be found in the above cited literature .",
    "for instance , differentiating eq ( [ phycorrc ] ) with respect to @xmath69 and @xmath88 and setting at the end @xmath89 , one obtains @xmath90 i.e. , when the surface is approached , the energy density increases as @xmath91 - the well known rule .",
    "this rule breaks down , of course , for sufficiently small @xmath59 , either because of spatial dispersion effects or simply because the macroscopic theory becomes inapplicable at atomic distances .",
    "case ( b ) : the medium is now moving , in the laboratory frame , with velocity @xmath92 in the @xmath69 direction . in the frame moving with the medium all the relations derived above for case ( a ) remain of course valid , if the coordinates and frequency refer to that frame .",
    "it is immediate to translate the results to the laboratory frame .",
    "if we denote by @xmath93 some correlation function at equilibrium ( i.e. , in the rest frame of the sample ) , then the correlation function in the laboratory frame is simply @xmath94 .",
    "this relation holds in the non - relativistic limit , @xmath95 , assumed in the present work , and it implies that the fourier transform @xmath96 is obtained from @xmath97 by replacing @xmath15 with @xmath98 .",
    "for instance the spectral density @xmath99 for a moving sample , as viewed from the laboratory frame , is given by the same expression as in the right - hand - side of eq.([phycorrb ] ) but with @xmath54 instead of @xmath15 .",
    "note , though , that this replacement results in a complicated , non - factorizable function of @xmath100 and @xmath15 , and no simple expression in real space , comparable to eq ( [ phycorrc ] ) , can be obtained .",
    "we will not elaborate on this case further but move on to    case ( c ) : here the sample is at rest but the electron subsystem moves with respect to the lattice with velocity @xmath3 , producing a dc current density @xmath4 .",
    "we do not specify the model for the lattice but just describe it by the lattice constant @xmath101 .",
    "the subsystem of the mobile carriers is described by the drude model with drift , eq ( [ epsilons ] ) .",
    "we will discuss in some detail the @xmath102 limit of this model and then briefly remark on the opposite limit , @xmath103 .    in the limit of small collision frequency @xmath21 ( the collisionless plasma model )",
    "the langevin sources originating in the lattice dominate over those in the electronic subsystem .",
    "taking the latter as `` noiseless '' and assuming the lattice in equilibrium , we can study the fluctuations using eqs .",
    "( [ pois]),([corra ] ) with @xmath104 this model has been considered in @xcite .",
    "an unnecessary approximation was introduced there at an early stage of the calculation . here",
    "we present a somewhat different approach .",
    "in fact , in @xmath105 - representation ( i.e. , fourier transform in the @xmath57 - plane but not in the @xmath59 - direction ) the calculation is straightforward and almost identical to case ( a ) .",
    "the only difference is that the dynamics of the fluctuations is now controlled by the @xmath106-dependent dielectric function in eq ( [ epsa ] ) , so that instead of ( [ phycorrb ] ) we have @xmath107 and the desired spectral density is @xmath108    because of the @xmath106 dependence of @xmath109 the integrand in ( [ c ] ) does not factorize , as it did in case ( a ) , and no simple analytical expression can be obtained . for small drift velocities one can expand @xmath110 in powers of @xmath111 .",
    "the first power does not contribute to ( [ c ] ) due to symmetry .",
    "the second power contributes , e.g. , to the quantity @xmath112 in eq ( [ e ] ) , a term proportional to @xmath113 this follows from a simple power counting : an extra factor @xmath114 in the integrand contributes an extra term @xmath115 upon integration over @xmath116 .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention an interesting qualitative effect due to the drift . in equilibrium",
    "the spectral density , eq ( [ e ] ) , has a sharp maximum at the frequency of the surface plasmon @xmath117 , when the factor @xmath118 becomes close to zero @xcite . in the presence of drift",
    "we have @xmath110 instead of @xmath119 , i.e. , surface plasmons acquire dispersion and , upon integration over @xmath116 , the peak in @xmath120 gets broadened .",
    "let us write down a useful spectral function which will be needed later : @xmath121 this result is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) [ with eq ( [ c ] ) inserted ] by differentiating with respect to the pairs of variables @xmath122 and adding the corresponding expressions .",
    "this concludes our discussion of the @xmath102 limit , when the lattice is the only source of noise . in the opposite limit , @xmath103",
    ", spontaneous fluctuations occur only in the electron plasma .",
    "we do not repeat the above calculations for this case but only note that the appropriate dielectric function now is @xmath123 and the appropriate spectral density for the spontaneous random sources is given in eq .",
    "( [ corrb ] ) .",
    "it is then straightforward to make the necessary replacements in eq ( [ c ] ) .",
    "consider an electric dipole , with dipole moment @xmath124 , subjected to a space and time - dependent electromagnetic field @xmath125 .",
    "the size of the dipole is assumed to be much smaller than the characteristic wave length of the field ( a `` point dipole '' ) .",
    "the dipole can rotate or vibrate but it does not move as a whole , i.e. , it can be assigned a fixed position @xmath126 and an arbitrary time dependence @xmath127 . under such conditions",
    "the dipole experiences an electric force @xmath128 ( @xmath129 is set equal to @xmath126 after differentiation ) and the lorenz magnetic force @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the velocity of the positive charge @xmath82 of the dipole ( and similarly for @xmath132 ) .",
    "thus , the magnetic force can be written as @xmath133 . using the vector identity @xmath134 ,",
    "one can write the total force as @xcite @xmath135    in our problem the dipole moment and the fields are fluctuating quantities and , since the fluctuations are stationary , the last term in eq ( [ f1 ] ) disappears upon averaging .",
    "we are left with the gradient term @xmath136 where , again , setting @xmath137 after differentiation is implied .",
    "this equation holds also for a dipole in motion and it serves as the starting point for calculating the fluctuation - induced forces @xcite .",
    "we now consider an atom , or a nanoparticle , or any entity with polarizability @xmath138 and size smaller than the relevant wavelength of the electromagnetic field ( we use below the generic term `` particle '' ) .",
    "we allow for the particle temperature @xmath139 to be different from the sample temperature @xmath43 .",
    "the particle is placed at a distance @xmath140 above the sample surface ( see fig . 2 for a schematic setup ) .",
    "above the sample surface . both the sample and the particle are at rest but a dc current with density @xmath4 is flowing in the sample , in the @xmath69- direction .",
    "the temperature of the sample , i.e. , of its lattice , is @xmath43 .",
    "the particle temperature is @xmath139 . ]",
    "the force acting on the particle consists of two parts :    1 .",
    "the fluctuating field emerging from the sample induces a dipole moment in the particle .",
    "this emerging field , which is just the field considered in the previous section , is often called `` free '' or `` spontaneous '' and will be designated as @xmath141 .",
    "interaction of this field with the dipole moment @xmath142 induced in the particle is responsible for the first part , @xmath143 , of the force .",
    "2 .   the particle itself induces a fluctuating electric field in the environment , due to the spontaneous fluctuations of its dipole moment .",
    "we denote the latter by @xmath144 and the corresponding field by @xmath145 .",
    "this field acts back on the particle , giving the second part , @xmath146 , of the force .",
    "thus , eq ( [ f2 ] ) splits into two parts , containing respectively @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "furthermore , since the particle polarizability @xmath138 is frequency dependent , one has to rewrite eq ( [ f2 ] ) in frequency domain @xcite : @xmath149 where @xmath150 has been used .",
    "in the rest of this section we specialize to the case @xmath102 .",
    "then the spectral density in the first term of eq ( [ f3 ] ) is given , in somewhat different notations , in eq ( [ e ] ) , so that @xmath143 is obtained immediately , after applying @xmath151 and setting @xmath137 at the end .",
    "it is useful to split the integral over @xmath15 into two pieces : from @xmath152 to @xmath153 and from @xmath153 to @xmath154 . switching the sign of the integration variables in the first piece , and using the conditions @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157",
    ", we finally obtain the following expressions for the @xmath69 and @xmath59- component of @xmath143 ( the @xmath158-component is zero ) : @xmath159",
    "@xmath160 where @xmath161 is defined in eq ( [ epsa ] ) , @xmath162 , @xmath163 are the real and imaginary parts of @xmath138 , and @xmath164 .",
    "since both the particle and the sample are at rest , it is natural that @xmath165 and @xmath18 depend on @xmath15 but not on @xmath166 ( no doppler shift ) .",
    "the doppler shifted frequency @xmath167 enters only into the electronic part of @xmath109 which controls the dynamics of the fluctuations .",
    "we now turn to the second term in eq ( [ f3 ] ) .",
    "first , one needs to compute the field @xmath168 induced by the spontaneous fluctuations of the particle dipole moment @xmath169 .",
    "to this end we introduce the green s function @xmath170 as a solution of the poisson equation for a unit charge at point @xmath126 .",
    "then the electric potential created at point @xmath129 by the `` point dipole '' @xmath171 and the electric field of that dipole are given by @xmath172 so that @xmath173 where @xmath174 labels the components and summation over indices is implied .",
    "the green s function can be written as @xmath175 where @xmath176 satisfies @xmath177 this is essentially the same as eq ( [ green ] ) , with @xmath178 instead of @xmath119 , but now we have both the source and the observation point above the sample surface , i.e. , @xmath179 .",
    "there is an apparent difficulty here , namely : @xmath170 , being a response to a point source , is singular at @xmath137 , and so is @xmath180 for @xmath181 .",
    "since in eq ( [ f3 ] ) we have to further differentiate the expression in eq ( [ f7 ] ) with respect to @xmath129 and then set @xmath137 , we end up with a meaningless singular expression .",
    "this problem is well known in the theory of casimir - lifshitz forces ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and the remedy is to make the standard subtraction of the vacuum green s function @xmath182 , thus , the physical green s function is @xmath183 or the fourier transformed @xmath184 , where @xmath185 is obtained from @xmath186 by replacing @xmath178 by unity .",
    "the result is : @xmath187 the last piece of information that we need to complete the calculation is the expression for the spectral density @xcite @xmath188 where an isotropic particle , with temperature @xmath189 has been assumed . putting all pieces together , and using @xmath190 we obtain the following expression for the components of @xmath146 : @xmath191    @xmath192    where @xmath193 and @xmath194 are the real and imaginary parts of @xmath195 , eq ( [ f10 ] ) .",
    "the total force acting on the particle is the sum of @xmath143 and @xmath146 . in the next section we consider some specific examples .",
    "let us summarize our general results for the fluctuation - induced forces , acting on a particle in the presence of drifting mobile carriers in the medium .",
    "the medium is described by the drude model with drift , eq ( [ epsilons ] ) , and two opposite limits were considered :    : collisionless plasma ( @xmath102 ) : the dielectric function of the model is @xmath196 , eq ( [ epsa ] ) .",
    ": non - absorptive , `` noiseless '' lattice ( @xmath103 ) : the dielectric function of the model is @xmath197 , eq ( [ epsb ] ) .",
    "the main reason for introducing these two limits , rather than dealing with the general model , eq ( [ epsilons ] ) , is that the frequency of the fluctuation sources originating in the drifting plasma is doppler shifted with respect to those originating in the lattice .",
    "thus , while it is easy to write down the spectral density of the sources for the general case ( this is just the sum of eq ( [ corra ] ) and eq ( [ corrb ] ) ) , it would make the resulting expressions for the forces even more cumbersome and more difficult to analyze .",
    "we therefore prefer to clarify the basic physics of the problem using the two limiting models .",

    "proportional to @xmath203 , the fluctuating field originates in the particle and , after being `` reflected '' from the medium , acts back on the particle . here",
    "the medium is passive , hence @xmath204 .",
    "note that both @xmath205-functions have in their argument the unshifted frequency @xmath15 .",
    "this is because in `` model 1 '' the spontaneous fluctuating sources of the medium reside in the lattice , which is at rest in the laboratory system ( the particle is at rest as well ) .",
    "the doppler shifted frequency @xmath54 appears only in @xmath206 which contains information on the effect of the drift on fluctuation dynamics .",

    "our problem , however , is different and so are the results .",
    "since in our setup the plasma component is moving with respect to the lattice , the dielectric function governing dynamics of the fluctuations is in general a complicated function of @xmath15 and @xmath116 . in addition , the frequency dependence of the random sources in the drifting plasma is different ( doppler shifted ) with respect to those in the stationary lattice . due to these factors the results are sensitive to the details of the model and",
    "can be quite diverse .",
    "for instance , in `` model 1 '' there are no `` drag '' at all , if the temperature of the sample and the particle are equal , see eq ( [ f2 ] ) with @xmath214 .",
    "this is because , as has been mentioned above , in `` model 1 '' the random sources , both in the medium and in the particle , are at rest .",
    "only the dielectric function @xmath215 is affected by the drift .",
    "therefore the situation is the same as in equilibrium , but with a modified , @xmath166-dependent dielectric function of the medium .    to obtain specific results",

    "the zero - order term corresponds to equilibrium , when @xmath297 does not depend on @xmath166 and @xmath298    for @xmath299 this coincides with the well known expression for the attraction force between a `` two - level atom '' and a collisionless plasma @xcite .",

    "the transformation of the expression in eq ( [ f3 ] ) to the matsubara sum was possible because in `` model 1 '' ( and for @xmath304 ) the spontaneous fluctuation sources are in equilibrium at the same temperature , only the ( noiseless ) plasma component is in motion .",

    "instead , we briefly discuss the case when the sample and the particle have different temperatures but there is no drift .",

    "for instance , taking the low temperature limit , i.e. , replacing the @xmath205- factors by @xmath302 , and assuming @xmath310 , one obtains @xmath311 .",
    "this should be compared with @xmath312 for the electron gas model under the same conditions .",
    "the interesting feature , pointed out already in @xcite , is that , depending on the parameters of the model , the force can be either repulsive or attractive .",
    "we have studied the fluctuation - induced forces acting on a small polarizable neutral particle ( atom , molecule or a nanoparticle ) , located close to the surface of a conducting medium .",
    "it is shown that presence of a dc current ( i.e. , the mobile carrier drift ) in the medium can have a significant effect on the forces .",
    "in particular , there appears a lateral force which can be in the direction of the current ( drag ) or in the opposite direction ( anti - drag ) .",
    "this phenomenon is distinct from the well studied coulomb drag @xcite , when current in a conductor induces a current ( or voltage ) in a nearby conductor . in our case",
    "the force is exerted on a small polarizable object , with a well defined excitation , at some frequency @xmath254 .",
    "this can be the resonant frequency of an atom or the frequency of a localized surface plasmon of a nanoparticle .",

    "the maximal value of the force is not small , in the sense that it is comparable to the normal ( casimir - lifshitz ) force in equilibrium .",
    "formulas for the forces , obtained in the present work , resemble those which appear in the theory of non - contact friction ( item ( ii ) in the introduction ) . the two problems , however , are different . in our problem",
    "both the particle and the sample are at rest , in the laboratory frame , only the mobile charge carriers are drifting .",
    "our results depend on whether the random spontaneous sources reside in the lattice or in the electron plasma ( models 1 and 2 , respectively ) .",
    "if there is no dissipation in the lattice , @xmath314 ( model 2 ) and @xmath315 , then the dielectric function of the medium ( lattice + plasma ) is a function of @xmath316 only and , since the random sources are located in the drifting plasma , the situation becomes as close as possible to the case of a medium moving as a whole .",
    "however to make the analogy complete one needs an additional strong requirement , namely , that the electrons in the drifting plasma could be considered as being in an internal equilibrium , with some effective temperature @xmath47 . otherwise one can not use rytov s theory for correlation functions of the ransom sources .",
    "we limited our considerations to the simplest models and conditions and did not attempt possible generalizations and extensions , like treating the general case ( eq ( [ epsilons ] ) with both @xmath51 and @xmath21 finite ) , or going beyond weak dissipation limit , or including the retardation effects .",
    "finally , let us stress that the high drift velocities , needed to make the discussed effects visible , can be achieved only in materials with low carrier density , like semiconductors , ionic conductors or other types of `` bad metals '' .",
