    "perovskite manganites , amno@xmath2 , have been studied in great detail during the past several years because of very interesting magnetic and electronic properties resulting from competing charge , exchange , and phonon interactions.@xcite insulating a- , c- , ce- , and g- type antiferromagnetic ( afm ) , metallic ferromagnetic , and charge or orbital ordering properties can be tuned over a wide range through the choice of size and charge of the a - site cations which control the degree of structural distortions and the formal valence of mn .",
    "recently , increased interest has focused on the colossal magnetoresistive effect and the destruction of the charge ordering induced by substitutions on the mn - site.@xcite    from the point of view of competing interactions , the stoichiometric srmn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 system is interesting because it should contain mn@xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) and fe@xmath7 ( @xmath9 ) ions . the g - type afm ( @xmath10  k ) and insulating srmno@xmath2 can be obtained in a cubic perovskite form through a two - step synthesis procedure,@xcite although many previous studies focused on the hexagonal phase that is stable in air at @xmath11c .",
    "we have recently shown that the g - type afm phase is preserved for single - valent mn@xmath4 in sr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 in the cubic , tetragonal and orthorhombic crystal structures.@xcite @xmath12 is suppressed by the bending of the mn - o - mn bond angle from 180@xmath13 and by the variance of the average size of the a - site ion via changes in the sr / ca ratio .",
    "the other end member of the series , srfeo@xmath2 , is also a cubic perovskite with a helical afm structure ( @xmath14 k).@xcite the low resistivity ( @xmath15 cm ) and metallic character when fully oxygenated @xcite was considered the reason for the absence of the jahn - teller distortion and orbital ordering of fe@xmath4 .",
    "deviations from oxygen stoichiometry in srfeo@xmath16 lead to a formation of several different oxygen - vacancy - ordered perovskite structures for @xmath17 and @xmath18.@xcite the substitution of co for fe yields a srfe@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 compound , which is ferromagnetic for @xmath19 with a large negative magnetoresistance for @xmath20.@xcite several oxygen - deficient srmn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath16 compositions have recently been studied.@xcite the orthorhombically distorted perovskite cafeo@xmath2 compound was shown to undergo the charge separation to fe@xmath6 ( @xmath8 ) and fe@xmath5 ( @xmath21).@xcite the highly energetically stable high - spin configuration was invoked as a reason for this behavior .",
    "this charge disproportionation phenomenon can also be observed in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1feo@xmath22,@xcite la@xmath0sr@xmath1feo@xmath22,@xcite and srmn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath16.@xcite    in this study , we investigate polycrystalline srmn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 . we have constructed the magnetic phase diagram for fully oxygenated samples .",
    "we observe an antiferromagnetic order for fe content @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "for intermediate fe content @xmath25 we observe a spin - glass behavior with features characteristic of `` ideal '' 3d ising spin glasses .",
    "increasing the fe content leads to significant covalency effects , such as a decrease of resistivity and covalent shortening of the lattice parameter .",
    "we also observe fe@xmath5/fe@xmath6 charge disproportionation in stoichiometric srmn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "the samples were prepared using a two - step synthesis method developed for similar kinetically stable perovskites.@xcite first , oxygen - deficient samples were prepared in argon at @xmath26c for @xmath23 and in air at @xmath27c for @xmath28 .",
    "the samples were then annealed in air or o@xmath29 at lower temperatures to achieve stoichiometric compositions with respect to the oxygen content .",
    "high pressure o@xmath29 in the range of 140 - 600 bar was applied for @xmath30 .",
    "high - pressure annealing is essential to produce fully oxygenated samples .",
    "the oxygen content in the @xmath31 sample was controlled within the range 2.86 - 3.00 by annealing the sample under partial pressure of oxygen between @xmath32 and 600 bar on a thermobalance or in a high - pressure furnace .",
    "the samples annealed in the furnace were carefully weighed before and after annealing and the oxygen content was determined from the mass difference .",
    "the ac susceptibility , dc magnetization and resistivity were measured using a physical property measurement system model 6000 ( quantum design ) .",
    "x - ray diffraction patterns were collected using a rigaku diffractometer .",
    "powder neutron diffraction was performed at the intense pulsed neutron source at argonne national laboratory .",
    "both x - ray and neutron diffraction data were refined using a gsas software .",
    "typical diffraction patterns are presented in fig .",
    "mssbauer    measurements were performed in transmission geometry using a 50 mci @xmath33co in rh source kept at room temperature and a krypton proportional detector .",
    "the samples measured at 5 k and 293 k were placed in an exchange gas cryostat cooled with liquid helium .",
    "silicon diode sensors allowed the control and stabilization of temperature to within @xmath34  k.",
    "all synthesized samples were single - phase with primitive cubic pm-3 m crystal structure .",
    "the structure can be simply described as a three - dimensional stacking of corner - sharing ( mn , fe)o@xmath35 regular octahedra formed by six equivalent randomly distributed mn - o or fe - o bonds .",

    "the @xmath36-axis lattice parameter systematically increases with increasing content of the larger fe ion substituted for mn .",
    "the slope of the @xmath36 vs. @xmath37 dependence is smaller for larger @xmath37 , which indicates the increasing role of the covalency of the fe - o bond . by studying the structural data for samples with the oxygen content @xmath38 ( determined from the thermogravimetric analysis )",
    ", we also found that the lattice parameter , @xmath36 , linearly increases with decreasing oxygen content .",
    "for example , for @xmath31 , the rate of this increase is 0.064(2 )  per oxygen atom in the formula unit .",
    "hence , we conclude that the difference of the lattice parameter between our results and those of ref . 10 is a result of different oxygen contents .",
    "the ac susceptibility for srmn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 samples is presented in fig .  [ ac ] .",
    "for @xmath39 and @xmath40 , we observe temperature dependencies that are characteristic    of antiferromagnetic materials .",
    "for @xmath25 we also observed a cusp , which is a signature of spin - glass behavior . from these results",
    "we have determined nel temperatures ( defined as the temperatures for which @xmath41 has a maximum slope ) and the spin - glass freezing temperatures , @xmath42 ( defined as the temperatures where the susceptibility cusp reaches its maximum ) .",

    "these properties will be discussed in detail throughout this section .",
    "inverse susceptibility as a function of temperature is linear above @xmath12 for @xmath43 and its intersection with the horizontal axis is negative , which points to antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "@xmath44 for higher fe contents @xmath45 is curved and its slope can be extrapolated either to a negative intersection when we analyze the temperature range just above @xmath12 , or to a positive intersection when we take into account higher temperatures .",
    "this behavior has been observed in srfeo@xmath2 @xcite and is a result of the presence of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions in these materials .",
    "the values of nel temperature and spin - glass freezing temperature are collected in the phase diagram in fig .",
    "four distinct regions in the phase diagram are observed . for @xmath46 , only an antiferromagnetic phase is observed with @xmath12 decreasing as @xmath37 increases .",
    "a decrease of @xmath12 has been explained for isoelectronic ca- and ba- lightly substituted in the cubic perovskite srmno@xmath2 @xcite to be a result of the @xmath47-site size variance @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the ionic size and @xmath50 is the fractional occupancy of the @xmath47 site.@xcite this parameter describes the local variations of the mn - o - mn bond angle in the cubic region that exist even when the average mn - o - mn bond angle is equal to 180 degrees . in the present case ,",
    "the increase of the fe content @xmath37 increases the @xmath51-site size variance .",
    "this effect changes the local variation of the mn - o - mn bond angle even when the average structure is cubic and hence leads to lower @xmath12 . additionally , different magnetic @xmath51-site ions ( fe@xmath5 or fe@xmath6 : see sec .",
    "[ sec : moss ] ) randomly substituted for mn@xmath4 change the net exchange integral and introduce disorder , which also lowers @xmath12 .    for @xmath52 , we observed both antiferromagnetic order and spin - glass behavior .",

    "et al . _ also observed both antiferromagnetism and spin glass in the @xmath53 and @xmath54 samples .",
    "we have seen that for a given fe content , when the oxygen content is increasing , @xmath12 decreases and @xmath42 increases .",
    "therefore , the @xmath54 oxygen deficient sample shows higher @xmath12 and lower @xmath42 .    in the next region of the phase diagram , where @xmath55 , only the spin - glass behavior can be observed .",
    "the spin - glass freezing temperature is almost constant in this region .",
    "this characteristic temperature is also nearly independent of the oxygen content .",
    "the magnitude of the ac susceptibility ( see fig .  [ ac ] ) is the largest for the @xmath56 sample , which indicates the largest effective magnetic moment for this composition .",
    "the last region is close to @xmath57 , where only antiferromagnetic order can be observed .",
    "the `` zero - field - cooled '' ( @xmath58 ) and `` field - cooled '' ( @xmath59 ) magnetizations , presented in fig .  [ zfr ] for @xmath31 and @xmath60 , were measured in the magnetic field of 1 koe .",
    "@xmath58    was measured on warming after cooling in a zero magnetic field and switching the magnetic field on at @xmath61  k. @xmath59 was subsequently measured on cooling in the magnetic field .",
    "we can observe a difference between @xmath58 and @xmath59 below a certain temperature .",
    "this difference is typical for spin glass systems .",
    "thermoremanent magnetization ( @xmath62 ) , which can be observed after field cooling to a temperature below @xmath42 and switching off the magnetic field , is also a manifestation of the spin - glass behavior .",
    "the @xmath60 sample shows this difference between @xmath58 and @xmath59 below a certain `` irreversibility temperature '' ( @xmath63).@xcite @xmath64  k and is lower than @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath62 decreases to zero at @xmath63 with increasing temperature .",
    "this sample shows a transition from the spin glass state to the paramagnetic state . the @xmath31 sample , which undergoes a transition from spin glass to the antiferromagnetic state , shows a significant difference between @xmath58 and @xmath59 above @xmath42 .",
    "in addition , the thermoremanent magnetization can also be observed in the antiferromagnetic state above @xmath42 up to @xmath12 .",

[ time ] .",
    "@xmath66 systematically decreases with @xmath69 for both samples .",
    "it approaches zero at the irreversibility line for the @xmath60 sample . for the @xmath31 sample",
    ", @xmath66 remains substantially nonzero above @xmath42 in the `` random antiferromagnetic state '' .",
    "the parameter @xmath67 , which is a measure of the relaxation rate , for @xmath60 increases with @xmath69 up to @xmath70 k and rapidly drops above this temperature .",
    "the increase of @xmath71 is not exponential as expected for an `` ideal '' spin glass.@xcite the @xmath71 dependence is different for the @xmath31 sample , which shows a maximum at @xmath72 and a subsequent decrease .",
    "this behavior may be a result of the presence of antiferromagnetic order in the spin - glass state , which inhibits the decay rate of the thermoremanent magnetization .    in fig .",

    "this powder was used for magnetic , structural , and mssbauer measurements , but could not be used for resistivity measurements .",
    "polycrystalline pellets were synthesized , but were slightly oxygen - deficient .",
    "therefore , these pellets of srfeo@xmath16 show a small increase of resistivity on decreasing temperature as seen in fig .",

    "we also checked other models of conduction by introducing a temperature dependent pre - factor to the formula @xmath91.@xcite the best description of our data can be obtained with @xmath92 8 - 9 for this formula .",
    "the physical meaning of this value is not yet clear because this value is much higher than that proposed in the framework of the existing models ( e.g. @xmath93 in mott s variable range hopping model @xcite or @xmath94 in the small polaron model @xcite ) .",
    "stoichiometric srmn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath22 samples were examined by applying mssbauer spectroscopy on the @xmath95fe isotope that is 2% abundant in the material . through a careful analysis of the magnetic hyperfine field and the isomer shift",
    ", mssbauer spectroscopy provides a way of ascertaining whether iron is in different chemical or crystallographical environments , as well as its valence state .",
    "high spin fe@xmath5 , fe@xmath4 , and fe@xmath96 have room temperature isomer shifts in the range 0.1 to 0.6 , -0.2 to 0.2 , and -0.8 to -0.9 mm / s , respectively ( relative to @xmath97fe).@xcite there are fewer studies of the isomer shift for fe@xmath6 ; therefore it is less well understood .",
    "the magnetic hyperfine field is dominated by the fermi contact interaction which gives rise to about 550 koe for high - spin fe@xmath5 having a mean spin of 5/2 for the @xmath98 electrons .",
    "thus , a general rule is that @xmath99  110 koe corresponds to @xmath99  1 bohr magneton ( one unpaired electron ) .",
    "these rules can substantially change due to covalency effects .",
    "increasing the covalency between iron and oxygen tends to produce lower isomer shifts , and to reduce the effective number of unpaired electrons which leads to lower magnetic hyperfine fields . in a metallic material",
    "polarized conduction electrons also affect the magnitude of the hyperfine field .",
    "the parent compound , srfeo@xmath22 , is known to be a metallic conductor that orders into a helical antiferromagnetic structure at low temperatures due to the competition between ferromagnetic nearest neighbors and antiferromagnetic next nearest neighbors.@xcite as seen in fig .",
    "[ moss ] , srfeo@xmath22 exhibits a set of sharp magnetically split lines ( 0.24 mm / s linewidth ) at 5  k. in the paramagnetic state at 293  k , the spectrum consists only of a slightly broadened single line ( 0.27  mm / s linewidth ) .",
    "thus , fe exists in only one valence state from 5  k to room temperature .",
    "charge balance suggests that srfeo@xmath22 forms with iron in the + 4 valence state .",
    "this is confirmed by the measured isomer shift of 0.059 mm / s at 293  k ( 0.154  mm / s at 5  k ) .",
    "the low magnetic field of 327 koe would also indicate that this material has a magnetic moment of @xmath100 rather than the expected @xmath101 , but the low magnetic field may be due to the nearly delocalized character of the electron in the @xmath102 orbital of fe@xmath4 with comcomitant lowering of the net field by the polarized conduction electrons .",
    "the quadrupole splitting for this material is nearly zero ( @xmath103  mm / sec ) at 293  k , agreeing with the values reported in the literature.@xcite this result indicates the absence of any extensive static jahn - teller distorted feo@xmath35 octahedra even though high - spin fe@xmath4 is a likely candidate for a jahn - teller ion due to the single electron in the @xmath102 orbital.@xcite however , a dynamic jahn - teller effect is not ruled out . due to the lifetime of the excited nuclear state ,",
    "the @xmath95fe nucleus is sensitive to fluctuating environments that fluctuate on a time scale longer than 10@xmath104 seconds . a fast dynamic jahn - teller effect where the electronic hopping is enhanced by the delocalized character of the @xmath102 electron could result in electric quadrupole fluctuation times that are too short for the fe nuclei to detect .",
    "thus , the electric quadrupole interaction effectively averages to near zero .",
    "thus , the high pressure synthesis technique appears to be successful in producing highly stoichiometric compounds of metallic srfeo@xmath22 and is a sound technique to produce stoichiometric samples of srmn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath22 .",
    "measurements were made on srmn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath22 at various temperatures to characterize the charge disproportionation properties of iron in the spin - glass , antiferromagnetic , and paramagnetic phases .",
    "charge disproportionation has been observed in the highly nonstoichiometric form of srmn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath16 as well as in cafeo@xmath22.@xcite charge balance would dictate that the valence state of fe should be + 4 ( since fe and mn share the same crystallographic sites for the first material and mn exists in only the + 4 valence state @xcite ) .",
    "what is usually observed is a 2-site iron mssbauer spectrum indicating that fe exists in 2 valence states rather than in a single , pure valence state of + 4 .",
    "the existence of two different fe valence states provides evidence for a charge disproportionation as follows : 2 fe@xmath105 fe@xmath106 + fe@xmath107 , where @xmath108 varies from 0 to 1 depending on the covalency between iron and oxygen .",
    "we have observed the presence of charge disproportionation in highly stoichiometric forms of srmn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath22 .",
    "thus , oxygen vacancies are not a factor in the charge disproportionation properties.@xcite as mn was added to srfeo@xmath22 , the spectra revealed the presence of two distinct fe sites having different magnetic hyperfine fields and isomer shifts .",

    "the fe ions appear to exist , in nearly equal proportions , in two valence states in the paramagnetic , antiferromagnetic , and spin - glass phases ( by examining the area under each mssbauer subspectra ) .",
    "mn is known to exist in a valence state close to + 4 through x - ray absorption spectroscopy chemical shift measurements on nonstoichiometric compounds.@xcite since mn does not charge disproportionate , then , because the fe sites occur in nearly equal proportions , the fe site having the largest magnetic field ( 480 koe at 5 k ) was assigned a + 3 valence state , and a + 5 valence state was assigned to the other fe site .",
    "the fe site assigned a + 3 valence state also has an isomer shift ( 0.35 mm / sec at 293 k ) that lies near that expected for fe@xmath5 ( between 0.1 and 0.6 mm / s for a high - spin state ) .",
    "this is exactly what one would expect for fully oxygenated srmn@xmath3fe@xmath3o@xmath22  that the average valence state of fe would be + 4 .",
    "the actual environment around each fe atom is rather complicated .",
    "fe@xmath5 , fe@xmath6 , and mn@xmath4 can all occupy the same site in this cubic perovskite .",
    "thus , since each ion has a different ionic size , there must be a disordered array of fe@xmath5 , fe@xmath6 , and mn@xmath4 oxygen octahedra of differing sizes and distortions throughout the lattice .",
    "it is worth noting that for fully oxygenated samples the quadrupole splitting at room temperature is smaller than for nonstoichiometric ones.@xcite this reflects a less distorted local environment , without oxygen vacancies , for the stoichiometric compositions .",
    "the distribution of different ions over the crystallographic lattice gives rise to the slight broadening of the mssbauer lines in the paramagnetic region .",
    "in addition , there are competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions in both the spin - glass region and the antiferromagnetic region ( since the parent compound , srfeo@xmath22 , has a helical antiferromagnetic structure )",
    ". the much broader mssbauer lines observed in the magnetically ordered regions for both the antiferromagnetic and spin - glass phases ( the outer linewidths were all greater than 1 mm / sec over the whole temperature region in fig .",
    "[ hyper ] ) are likely due to competing magnetic interactions between the transition metal    cations , fe@xmath120 , fe@xmath121 , and mn@xmath7 .",
    "since the materials under study have a random distribution of fe@xmath120 , fe@xmath121 , and mn@xmath7 ions throughout the lattice , different sizes and magnetic moments of these ions lead to a variation in the structural and magnetic environments around the fe sites , resulting in the distribution of hyperfine parameters observed in the mossbauer spectra .",
    "thus , as a function of temperature and as a function of composition , from @xmath122 , there is a pronounced broadening of the mssbauer linewidths in both the antiferromagnetic and spin - glass phases .",
    "fitting the spectra with a distribution of magnetic hyperfine fields , quadrupole splittings , and isomer shifts did not reveal any clearly distinguishable characteristics between the antiferromagnetic and spin - glass phases  there was a significant amount of frustration in both phases arising from the competing magnetic interactions that also occur in both phases .",
    "however , since the spectra revealed two easily distinguishable sites , the fits to the spectra were made using a simple lorentzian model which gives average hyperfine field values .",
    "the variation of the average magnetic hyperfine field with temperature for srmn@xmath3fe@xmath3o@xmath22 is given in fig .",
    "[ hyper ] . due to the complicated nature of the magnetic interactions",

    "the equal proportion of fe@xmath5 to fe@xmath6 is nearly maintained over all temperatures .",
    "however , near the spin - glass / antiferromagnetic transition temperature , there is a deviation from this behavior indicating the presence of more complex behavior .",
    "three - site models have been applied to other materials where fe charge disproportionates into + 3 and + 5 valence states , such as in la@xmath0sr@xmath1feo@xmath22.@xcite however , applying such a model does not eliminate the anomaly near the spin - glass transition temperature .",
    "further investigations are under way to understand the existence of this valence state anomaly near the spin - glass / antiferromagnetic phase boundary .",

    "the increase of fe content , @xmath37 , is accompanied by stronger covalency of the fe - o bond , which leads to the shortening of this bond , a decrease of resistivity , lower isomer shifts and magnetic hyperfine fields .",

    "<S> we combine the results of magnetic and transport measurements with mssbauer spectroscopy and room - temperature diffraction data to construct the magnetic phase diagram of the new family of cubic perovskite manganites srmn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we have found antiferromagnetic ordering for lightly and heavily fe - substituted material , while intermediate substitution leads to spin - glass behavior . near the srmn@xmath3fe@xmath3o@xmath2 composition these two types of ordering are found to coexist and affect one another . </S>",
    "<S> the spin glass behavior may be caused by competing ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions among mn@xmath4 and observed fe@xmath5 and fe@xmath6 ions . </S>"
