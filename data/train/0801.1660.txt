    "the neutrino flux streaming off a collapsed supernova ( sn ) core is an intriguing astrophysical case where flavor transformations depend sensitively on some of the unknown elements of the leptonic mixing matrix  @xcite .",

    "while galactic sne are rare , various ongoing and future experimental programmes depend on large detectors that , besides their main purpose , are also sensitive to sn neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "therefore , understanding the flavor evolution of a sn neutrino signal remains of topical interest .",
    "the flavor transformation probabilities not only depend on the matter background , but also on the neutrino fluxes themselves : neutrino - neutrino interactions provide a nonlinear term in the equations of motion  @xcite that causes collective flavor transformations  .",
    "only recently has it been fully appreciated that in the sn context these collective effects give rise to qualitatively new phenomena  .",
    "one peculiar aspect of the expected sn neutrino fluxes is the hierarchy @xmath1 so that there is an excess flux of @xmath2 pairs over those of the other flavors .",
    "the nonlinear terms cause a collective transformation @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a specific linear combination of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the detailed dynamics of this transition is complicated and several important aspects are only numerically observed , not analytically understood .",
    "still , the most crucial point is that the pair transformation @xmath3 proceeds collectively much faster than ordinary pair annihilation , so we have to contend with a `` speed - up phenomenon '' @xcite .",
    "the pair process does not violate flavor - lepton number .",
    "being an instability in flavor space , it proceeds efficiently even for a very small mixing angle .     and",
    "the effective neutrino - neutrino interaction potential @xmath7 for an o - ne - mg core collapse sn  @xcite.[fig : profile ] ]        a very different situation prevails in the interior of a sn core where the @xmath0 distribution is determined by a large chemical potential that enhances the @xmath0 density and suppresses the @xmath8 density relative to that of @xmath4 and @xmath9 so that collective pair conversions are not possible .",
    "neutrino - neutrino interactions are strong , but their only impact is to synchronize the flavor oscillations ( `` self - maintained coherence '' ) .",
    "significant flavor transformation here requires a violation of flavor - lepton number .",

    "once more we have a strongly enhanced @xmath0 and a suppressed @xmath8 flux relative to the other flavors  @xcite .",
    "once more , collective pair transformations are not possible : efficient flavor conversion requires a large violation of flavor - lepton number and is not possible if the ordinary matter density is large . at some distance from the neutrino sphere",
    ", the @xmath0 flux encounters the usual msw level crossings driven by the atmospheric neutrino mass difference @xmath10 ( h  crossing ) and by the solar mass difference @xmath11 ( l  crossing ) , leading to the usual resonant transformations  @xcite .",
    "an interesting new case is motivated by the insight that sne with the lowest progenitor masses of 810  @xmath12 , encompassing perhaps 30% of all cases , collapse before forming an iron core , the class of o - ne - mg core collapse sne  . in state - of - the - art numerical simulations",
    "these sne explode even in a spherically symmetric treatment ( convection plays no role ) , largely because their envelope mass is very small . by the same token , the matter density profile above the core is very steep even at the time of core bounce . in this case",
    "the h and l level crossings occur very close to the neutrino sphere and may well lie deeply within the collective neutrino region .",

    "the bump seen around @xmath34 mev is due to an abrupt change in the matter density profile used for the computation ( see @xcite for details ) , and we do not address it here . the transition at @xmath35 mev is rather sharp , however the one at @xmath36 mev is not as abrupt .",
    "this results in a two - step function for @xmath26 , with the step at @xmath36 mev somewhat smoothened out .",
    "broadly , this is an example of a `` msw prepared spectral split . ''",
    "in a two - flavor language , it is explained as follows .",
    "the strong neutrino - neutrino interactions lead to a synchronization of the neutrino oscillations .",
    "the flavor polarization vector of the ensemble begins at high density essentially aligned with the @xmath0 direction in flavor space . after passing the msw region ,",
    "the polarization vector emerges with a significant transverse component relative to the mass direction because the msw transition is not fully adiabatic .",
    "subsequently this msw - prepared initial condition is subject to collective effects only .",
    "as the effective neutrino - neutrino interaction becomes weaker , the modes above a certain energy @xmath37 orient themselves along the mass direction , those with smaller energies in the opposite direction .",
    "this is precisely the `` neutrino only '' case studied in refs .   as a generic case for a spectral split , a case that requires one to prepare the polarization vector with a large transverse component .",
    "( for neutrinos plus antineutrinos , the msw preparation is not necessary because the collective pair transformations alone engineer a split . )",
    "our main goal here is to use the picture of a msw - prepared spectral split to derive analytically the main features seen in duan et al.s numerical study  @xcite , viz .",
    "the existence and the positions of the spectral splits .",
    "the numerical model in fig .  [ fig : profile ] shows that the msw resonances are within the collective neutrino region , but not deeply inside .",
    "therefore it is not a priori obvious if the `` synchronized msw preparation '' and the subsequent `` split '' can be clearly separated . for our discussion",
    "we therefore adopt a more schematic model .",
    "we artificially increase the neutrino - neutrino interaction strength ( raise the @xmath7-profile in fig .  [",

    "the decrease of the effective neutrino - neutrino interaction with radius is such that the spectral split is essentially adiabatic .",
    "quantitatively , the length scale @xmath45 is large enough to satisfy the adiabaticity condition ( see sec .",
    "v of  @xcite ) during the spectral split .",
    "the very development of a step - like feature in @xmath26 in fig .",
    "[ fig : numericalsplit ] is an expression of the adiabaticity .",
    "the `` sharpness '' of the step in @xmath26 is a measure of the degree of adiabaticity , an extremely slowly decreasing neutrino - neutrino interaction corresponds to a perfect step function in @xmath26  @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : muprofile ] ) is arbitrarily large .",
    "this makes the h and l level crossings more synchronized , and pushes the regions where the spectral splits occur , i.e. the regions where @xmath47 becomes comparable to @xmath48 or @xmath49 , to much larger radii .",
    "this also renders the spectral splits even more adiabatic , is a power law , the length scale @xmath50 increases with increasing @xmath51 . as a result , larger radius for spectral",

    "it is also important that the msw transition is not perfectly adiabatic . in our schematic model ,",
    "we use the power - law profile for the matter potential , @xmath52 with @xmath53 , @xmath54  km and @xmath55 .",
    "this approximates reasonably the numerical @xmath16 profile of fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] in the neighborhood of the h and l crossings .",
    "this allows an analytic estimate of the level crossing probabilities at the two resonances .",

    "apart from these minor changes , the physical pictures with the realistic profile and our schematic profile are identical .",

    "while in general there is a second - order difference between the @xmath5 and @xmath6 refractive index  @xcite that can be important for collective neutrino oscillations  @xcite , for the low matter densities relevant in our case this `` mu - tau matter term '' is irrelevant .",
    "the factor @xmath64 in @xmath65 implies `` multi - angle effects '' for neutrinos moving on different trajectories @xcite .",
    "however , for realistic sn conditions the modifications are small , allowing for a single - angle approximation  @xcite . in the strongly synchronized regime",
    "this is not surprising : the strong neutrino - neutrino interaction causes self - maintained coherence not only between different energy modes , but also between different angular modes .",
    "it has not been explained why the single - angle approximation remains good even when the neutrino - neutrino interaction becomes weak , although numerically this is observed to be the case  @xcite .",
    "we are studying the spatial evolution of the neutrino fluxes in a quasi - stationary situation .",

    "it is most useful to study its evolution in the basis of instantaneous propagation eigenstates where we denote the total matrix of density as @xmath125 .",
    "since the only effect of the neutrino - neutrino interactions is to synchronize the oscillations and to reduce the system to an equivalent single - energy case , the propagation eigenstates are defined by the ordinary matter term for a monochromatic neutrino beam , wheras the neutrino - neutrino interaction plays no further role .",
    "the propagation basis coincides with the weak interaction basis when the matter density is large so that our initial state is @xmath126 in normal hierarchy , and @xmath127 in inverted hierarchy .",

    "we have studied the three - flavor evolution of a @xmath0 burst that first undergoes two msw level crossings driven by @xmath250 and @xmath251 , respectively , and then undergoes spectral splits by the adiabatically decreasing strength of the neutrino - neutrino interaction .",
    "this case study of an msw - prepared spectral split serves as a proxy for the recent numerical study of the prompt @xmath0 burst in an o - ne - mg core collapse sn . here",
    ", the matter density profile is so steep that the sequence between msw crossings and collective neutrino oscillations is reversed from what would be expected in a traditional iron - core sn .",
    "first we have analytically estimated the population of the propagation eigenstates after the msw transformations . due to the sharply falling matter density at the edge of the core of the star , the msw transitions are not completely adiabatic , which helps in satisfying a precondition for the spectral splits to take place .",
    "we have used the well - known analytic double - exponential formula for calculating the jump probabilities .",
    "we have studied numerically the subsequent spectral splits .",
    "we have analytically determined the split frequencies on the basis of two conserved flavor - lepton number combinations that supersede the single conservation law encountered in a two - flavor situation .",
    "the neutrino mass - gap hierarchy allows for a factorization of an h split and an l split , similar to the factorization of the msw effect into an h and an l crossing .",
    "the dynamics of the split evolution is clearly seen to be a two - step process .",
    "the dynamics of the two spectral splits can be understood in terms of the motion of the neutrino state in the @xmath104@xmath111 triangle diagram , which can explain many of the features of neutrino evolution qualitatively .",
    "the number of possible splits can be deduced by the location of the neutrino state inside the triangle .",
    "we have also shown how the positions of the splits can be calculated accurately given the initial neutrino spectra , and calculated the @xmath0 survival probability analytically , that matches the numerical computations .",
    "our analytic treatment accounts very nicely for the numerical findings of duan et al .",
    "@xcite . in their case",
    "the msw conversion and the spectral splits are spatially very close so that it is not a priori obvious that our schematic model would be a good representation . in our treatment we have enforced a clear separation between the msw region and the spectral - split region by assuming the limit of large neutrino - neutrino interactions , a limit that also ensures that the msw transition is perfectly synchronized and that the spectral split is perfectly adiabatic . a posteriori , however , our interpretation as a msw prepared spectral split appears nicely justified and quantitatively appropriate .",
    "our treatment is also a useful application of the three - flavor oscillation machinery developed by two of us recently  @xcite .",
