    "if , on the other hand , the interaction between magnetoexcitons assumes a van der waals profile , as is typical for the inter - exciton interaction in analogous systems at vanishing magnetic field,@xcite the energy of the compressible crossover state is lower than that of the phase - separated quantum hall systems , thus , at least in the neighborhood of @xmath134 and @xmath135 where the two - magnon interaction dominates over many - magnon effective interaction terms , the gapless state prevails .",
