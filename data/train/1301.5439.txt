    "neutrino emission from a superfluid neutron liquid is currently thought to be the dominant cooling mechanism of the baryon matter , for some ranges of the temperature and/or matter density .",
    "one of the mechanisms leading the neutron star cooling consists on the recombination of thermally excited baryon bcs pairs into the condensate with emission of neutrino pairs via neutral weak currents @xcite .",
    "it is generally accepted that , for temperatures near the associated superfluid critical temperatures @xmath2 , emission from pair breaking and formation ( pbf ) processes dominates the neutrino emissivities in many cases .",
    "this idea has become the basis of the minimal cooling paradigm for superfluid neutron stars @xcite .    according to modern investigations @xcite , the neutrino radiation caused by the pairing of baryons into singlet state",
    "is strongly suppressed , and the dominant neutrino emission , at the long - cooling epoch , occurs from the triplet - correlated condensate of superfluid neutrons which , as expected , exists in the superdense core of the star .",
    "neutrino energy losses owing to the triplet pbf processes have been initially derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , ignoring the anomalous weak interactions . the self - consistent approach to this problem was developed in refs .",
    "l10a , l10c , l11c , where the anomalous effective vertices are found as the solution of the dyson s equations in the ladder approximation .",
    "poles of the found analytical solutions @xcite indicate the existence of the undamped collective oscillations of the order parameter in the superfluid @xmath3p@xmath4 condensate of neutrons with @xmath1 .",
    "some of the collective excitations with the excitation energy smaller than the superfluid energy gap are able to decay into neutrino pairs .",
    "this is , for example , the `` so - called '' normal - flapping mode which represents the nonunitary excitation with a nonzero average spin expectation value and can be termed by spin wave .",
    "the neutrino decay of such spin waves could be important for thermally - emitting neutron stars , presumably cooling through the combination of neutrino emission from the interior and photon cooling from the surface , the latter is responsible for their observed thermal emissions @xcite .",
    "exact solutions of the vertex equations are complicated by the anisotropy of the triplet order parameter .",
    "therefore the preliminary analysis of the collective oscillations and the neutrino energy losses from the @xmath5p@xmath4 superfluid neutron liquid has been performed in the average - angle approximation replacing the anisotropic energy gap in the quasiparticle energy by its value averaged over angles @xcite .",
    "the spin - wave energy , as found in this approach , is proportional to the temperature - dependent energy gap amplitude @xmath6 .",
    "however the more rigorous analysis with taking into account of the gap anisotropy has shown that the average - angle approximation is not justified for examination of the collective oscillations of the superfluid condensate .",
    "it was found @xcite that the gap anisotropy leads to a strong decreasing of the level energy along with a lowering of the temperature .",
    "one can expect that this is to suppress substantially the neutrino energy losses caused by the spin wave decays because the rate of neutrino losses is strongly dependent on the wave energy .    in this paper",
    "we examine the effect of the anisotropy of the superfluid energy gap and the residual particle - hole interactions onto the neutrino energy losses from the @xmath5p@xmath4 superfluid neutron liquid with @xmath1 .",
    "we consider the neutrino emission caused by the pbf processes and by the spin - wave decays ( swd ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section contains some preliminary notes .",
    "we discuss the effective strong interactions in the superdense neutron matter , the order parameter for the triplet pair - correlated system with strong interactions and introduce the notation used below . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the general expression for neutrino emissivity of the medium through neutral weak currents in terms of  the imaginary part of the current - current correlator . in sec .",
    "iv , we examine the anomalous vertices with taking into account of both the fermi - liquid effects and the anisotropy of the superfluid energy gap for the case of @xmath5p@xmath7 pairing with @xmath1 , as is adopted in the minimal cooling paradigm page09 .",
    "we also discuss the self - consistent response of the superfluid neutron liquid onto external neutrino field . finally , in sec .",
    "v , we evaluate the self - consistent neutrino energy losses from the pbf and swd processes and compare them with the neutrino losses caused by modified urca processes and nn - bremsstrahlung .",
    "section vi contains a short summary of our findings and the conclusion .",
    "a short appendix contains some transformation of the previous results .    in this work we use the standard model of weak interactions , the system of units @xmath8 and the boltzmann constant @xmath9",
    "the order parameter , @xmath10 , arising owing to triplet pairing of quasiparticles in a degenerate fermi system , represents a @xmath11 symmetric matrix in spin space , @xmath12 . near the fermi surface",
    "this matrix can be written as ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath13where @xmath14 are pauli spin matrices , and @xmath15 .",
    "the spin - angle structure of the triplet condensate is defined by a vector @xmath16 in spin space which depends on the direction of the quasiparticle momentum @xmath17 .",
    "the angular dependence of the order parameter is represented by the unit vector @xmath18 which defines the polar angles @xmath19 on the fermi surface , @xmath20we assume that the ( temperature - dependent ) gap amplitude @xmath21 is a complex constant ( on the fermi surface ) , and @xmath22 is a real vector which we normalize by the condition @xmath23hereafter we use the angle brackets to denote angle averages , @xmath24    the triplet pairing leads to the energy gap , @xmath25 , in the quasiparticle spectrum which is in general anisotropic .",
    "we are mostly interested in the values of quasiparticle momenta @xmath17 near the fermi surface @xmath26 ,  where the quasiparticle energy is given by@xmath27with@xmath28and @xmath29 is the fermi velocity of the nonrelativistic neutrons .",
    "@xmath30here the fact is used that , in the absence of external fields , the gap amplitude @xmath21 is real .    the spin - orbit interaction among quasiparticles",
    "is known to dominate in the nucleon matter of a high density @xcite with the most attractive channel of interactions in the @xmath5p@xmath4 state with @xmath31 . in this case",
    "the order parameter in the superfluid system can be constructed with the aid of the set of mutually orthogonal complex vectors @xmath32 which generate standard spin - angle functions of the total angular momentum @xmath33 and @xmath34 , so that @xmath35and are normalized by the condition @xmath36these can be found in the form ( see details in ref .",
    "@xcite):@xmath37    in our approach",
    "it is necessary to distinguish the interactions in the channel of two quasiparticles from the interactions in the particle - hole channel . since we are interested in values of quasiparticle momenta near the fermi surface , @xmath38 , the momentum transferred in the collision of two quasiparticles is of the order of @xmath39 .",
    "in this case the non - central spin - orbit and tensor interactions are most important in the superdense neutron matter .",
    "the attractive spin - orbit interaction which dominates in the channel of two quasiparticles is the basic reason of the neutron pairing @xcite .",
    "the most attractive channel corresponds to spin , orbital , and total angular momenta @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , respectively , and pairs quasiparticles into the @xmath5p@xmath4 states with @xmath43 .",
    "the substantially smaller tensor interactions lift the strong paramagnetic degeneracy inherent in pure @xmath5p@xmath4 pairing and mix states of different magnetic quantum numbers .",
    "it is well known that the tensor interactions generate also a small @xmath5f@xmath4 admixture to the ground state and markedly modify the @xmath5p@xmath4 energy gap @xcite .",
    "the purpose of our study is however not the ground state but the linear response of the superfluid system onto external neutral weak currents . in this work",
    "we assume that the ground state of the superfluid neutron system and the magnitude of the energy gap at the fermi surface are the known external parameters .",
    "neutrino emissivity of the neutron system with a mixed @xmath3p@xmath4-@xmath5f@xmath4 superfluid condensate was examined in ref .",
    "according to this work , incorporating of the small admixture of the @xmath3f@xmath4 state requires of sophisticated calculations but does not affect noticeably the excitation spectra and the neutrino emissivity through neutral weak currents .",
    "accordingly , throughout this paper , we neglect tensor forces . the pairing interaction , in the most attractive channel , can then be written as @xcite   @xmath44where @xmath45 is the density of states near the fermi surface ; and @xmath46 is the interaction amplitude .",
    "consider now the interactions in the particle - hole channel . in our analysis",
    ", we shall use the fact that the fermi - liquid interactions do not interfere with the pairing phenomenon if approximate hole - particle symmetry is maintained in the system , i.e. , the fermi - liquid interactions remain unchanged upon pairing . near the fermi surface ,",
    "the fermi - liquid effects are reduced to the standard particle - hole interactions:@xmath47    for generality , eq .",
    "( [ ph ] ) should be supplemented with contributions from spin - orbit and tensor interactions . however , in uniform media , the momentum of particle - hole type excitations equals the transferred momentum @xmath48 .",
    "we are interested in the medium response at the time - like momentum transfer , @xmath49 . in this case",
    "the contribution from the noncentral interactions , which depend on the transferred momentum sf , migdal , would be proportional to some power of @xmath50 and vanish in the limit , @xmath51 , which we are interested in ( see below ) .",
    "the emission of neutrino pairs is kinematically possible thanks to the existence of a superfluid energy gap , which admits the quasiparticle transitions with time - like momentum transfer @xmath52 , as required by the final neutrino pair : @xmath53 .",
    "we consider the standard model of weak interactions through neutral weak currents .",
    "after integration over the phase space of escaping neutrinos and antineutrinos the total energy which is emitted into neutrino pairs per unit volume and time is given by the following formula ( see details , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath54where @xmath55 is the heaviside step - function ; @xmath56 are dirac indices ; @xmath57 is the number of neutrino flavors ; @xmath58 is the fermi coupling constant , and @xmath59 is the retarded weak polarization tensor of the medium .    in general ,",
    "the weak polarization tensor of the medium is a sum of the vector - vector , axial - axial , and mixed terms .",
    "the mixed vector - axial polarization has to be an antisymmetric tensor , and its contraction in eq .",
    "( [ qqq ] ) with the symmetric tensor @xmath60 vanishes .",
    "thus only the pure - vector and pure - axial polarizations should be taken into account .",
    "we then obtain @xmath61 , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are vector and axial - vector weak coupling constants of a neutron , respectively .",
    "the fermi velocity is small in the nonrelativistic system , @xmath29 , and we can study the neutrino energy losses in the lowest order over this small parameter .",
    "we are interested in the time - like domain of the transferred energy and momentum , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , in accordance with the total energy and momentum of escaping neutrino pairs .",
    "since the transferred space momentum comes in the polarization functions of the medium in a combination @xmath66 , one can evaluate the polarization functions in the limit @xmath67 .",
    "conservation of the vector current requires @xmath68 .",
    "this relation reflects the fact that the neutrino - pair emission through the vector channel of neutral weak currents is strongly suppressed in nonrelativistic systems @xcite .",
    "therefore we focus on the axial channel of the weak interactions , assuming @xmath69 .",
    "further simplification is possible due to the fact that , in the lowest ( zero ) order over the particle velocity , only the space component of the axial - vector vertex survives .",
    "this allows to write @xmath70with @xmath71 .",
    "the field interaction with a superfluid should be described with the aid of four effective three - point vertices .",
    "there are two ordinary effective vertices corresponding to creation of a particle and a hole by the field that differ by direction of fermion lines and  two anomalous vertices that correspond to creation of two particles or two holes .",

    "as shown above , the gap anisotropy leads to quenching of the pbf neutrino emissivity on about 15% , while the residual particle - hole interactions increase the pbf emissivity on about 5% .",
