    "various quantum data buses have been introduced to bridge this gap .",
    "@xcite in this context , we have proposed to use the ground states of a strongly coupled spin chain as a quantum data bus , or a spin bus .  @xcite we have shown that the parity of the spin bus can significantly alter the long - range effective couplings and entanglement between qubits that are coupled to the spin bus ,  @xcite and external fields can modify the form of the effective interaction between the attached qubits .",

    "@xcite    an ideal quantum information processor has identical qubits , with precise control over couplings between qubits , and the qubits should be well isolated from their environment . however , in reality it is essentially impossible to create identical qubits based on artificial structures such as quantum dots and josephson junctions , and in a solid state environment there are normally several sources of qubit variance .",
    "for example , the size of a quantum dot and the electron orbitals are largely determined by the gate structure and the applied gate voltages .",
    "they can also be strongly influenced by factors such as the band structure of the host semiconductor and the random potential landscape due to modulation doping .",
    "furthermore , the coulomb exchange coupling between spin qubits is determined by the exponentially small overlap of the electron orbitals , and controlled by the gate voltages .",
    "small variations in gate voltages could thus cause large changes in the exchange coupling .",
    "such deviations from the ideal value could lead to imperfect gate operations , and possible gate errors .",
    "@xcite there are generally also very slow charge traps in a semiconductor heterostructure , where a trap can switch between two different charge distributions at a time scale much longer than the qubit operation time scales . while such a trap would probably be static during a quantum operation , it could modify the exchange coupling to a value that is different from the calibrated value .",
    "similarly , via hyperfine interaction , environmental nuclear spins produce a local random magnetic field for a quantum dot confined electron spin qubit .",
    "@xcite this field can be considered quasi - static in the context of a spin bus because its dynamics is much slower than the bus mediated gates . in short , in building a practical quantum information processor , deviations from calibrated values for various control parameters are inevitable .",
    "it is thus necessary to know the engineering tolerance in the variation of parameters such as the spin - spin coupling and external magnetic fields .    in this paper",
