    "every physical theory can be formulated as a probabilistic theory : each type of physical system is characterized through a set of _ observables _ , representing the possible measurements that can be performed on the system , with an associated set of _ states _ , assigning probabilities to the measurement outcomes .",
    "the duality of states and observables is formalized in the notion of a _ statistical duality _ , also called _ convexity model _ or _ statistical model _ , of which quantum mechanics and classical statistical mechanics are particular realizations .",
    "this structure has been used as the starting point for a reconstruction of quantum mechanics as a statistical physical theory in fundamental studies in the 1960s-70s@xcite .    in the past decade ,",
    "statistical models have been the basis for a series of very original and penetrating investigations by the late sawek bugajski and his collaborators ( enrico beltrametti and werner stulpe ) .",
    "they studied a particular classical representation of quantum mechanical density operators and observables in terms of probability measures and functions over a ` phase space ' which is identified with the set of pure quantum states .",
    "this representation was first formulated by b.  misra @xcite and others in the 1970s , but its significance as ` the ' _ canonical classical extension _ of quantum mechanics was recognized by s.bugajski @xcite .",
    "e. beltrametti and s. bugajski exhibited some intriguing features of the canonical classical extension , notably among them the so - called bell phenomenon in a classical framework@xcite and the fact that _ all _ quantum observables ( positive operator valued measures , or povms ) , whether sharp ( projection valued measures , pvms ) or not , are represented classically as",
    "_ fuzzy random variables_. these observations led to the inception and development of a generalized classical probability theory , referred to as fuzzy probability theory@xcite .",
    "this line of research was a demonstration of sawek bugajski s creativity as a researcher in mathematical physics and the foundations of quantum mechanics .",
    "his late work , abruptly cut short by his untimely death in march 2003 , comprises a legacy full of intriguing ideas and questions for future research waiting to be carried further@xcite .",
    "sawek had hoped to demonstrate that the formalisms of statistical models and fuzzy probability theory are useful tools for investigations in quantum information science , particularly in quantum computation .",
    "the aim of the present contribution is to give a brief exposition of this approach to quantum mechanics and to help build an intuitive understanding of the intriguing features referred to above .",
    "i will review the concept of statistical models , recall the quantum and classical examples , and provide a comprehensive account of all possible mutual embedding schemes .",
    "i will show that the canonical classical extension of quantum mechanics is the only ` good ' classical representation of quantum mechanics as a statistical model . since quantum observables are in this description represented as fuzzy classical random variables , it follows that the enhanced information storage and cryptographic capacities of quantum systems must be seen as a consequence of the fact that the set of quantum observables appears as a restriction of the set of all classical random variables to a subset of fuzzy random variables .    the title phrase , `` less is more ... '' , refers to the fact that quantum uncertainty can be utilized as resources for information processing purposes in the broadest sense .",
    "for example , noncommuting pairs of observables can be measured jointly if one allows for an appropriate pay - off between the degrees of unsharpness in the respective marginal measurements , quantified by suitable uncertainty relations .",
    "another example is given by the existence of _ informationally complete _ povms , which are necessarily _ unsharp _ observables .",
    "further , it has been observed that certain state discrimination procedures are optimally performed by povms which are not pvms .",
    "finally , measurements which are _ less _ precise may be designed so as to be less invasive , thus allowing _ more _ control over the observed system . incidentally , th.konrad chose the same motto for his doctoral thesis on unsharp quantum measurements@xcite .",
    "while our choices were made independently of each other , we may both have been ( consciously or subconsciously ) influenced by h. dehmelt s famous review @xcite which was written in the same spirit .",
    "the reader may wish to read the present article in conjunction with the related contributions by chris fuchs@xcite and guido bacchiagaluppi in this volume .",
    "the former uses the affine classical embedding of quantum states induced by an informationally complete povm to explore aspects of the concept of quantum information .",
    "the latter investigates the description of state changes in the framework of the misra - bugajski canonical classical extension .",
    "this work is dedicated to the memory of sawek bugajski .",
    "every type of physical system can be prepared and observed in a variety of ways . in order to exhibit regularities in the observation data",
    ", it must be possible to reproduce ( practically ) the ` same ' conditions of preparation and to carry out operations which can be identified as ( practically ) the ` same ' measurements , so as to be able to determine that different preparations tend to lead to different measurement outcomes .",
    "thus , the theoretical modelling of a physical system should be based on the structures of a set @xmath0 of _ states _ , which represent the different possible , reproducible preparations , and a set @xmath1 of _ observables _ , which represent the different possible measurements .",
    "a state and an observable should together determine a probability distribution that corresponds to the expected frequencies of the outcomes of the same ( class of ) measurement , repeated many times on a system ( or a collection of independent systems ) prepared in the same state .",
    "these ideas entail some basic properties of the sets @xmath0 and @xmath2 which we will spell out next .",
    "the possibility of randomly choosing different states , with fixed probability weights , and subjecting them to _ independent _ runs of the same measurement implies that the set of states should be convex , thus including all mixtures of any finite or ( by extrapolation ) countable subsets .",
    "moreover it follows that each measurement outcome , labelled by a value @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , say , gives rise to an affine map @xmath5\\,,\\;\\;\\rho \\mapsto e_{k}\\left ( \\rho \\right ) \\equiv p_{\\rho } \\left ( a_{k}\\right )   \\label{effect1}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the probability of the outcome @xmath7 in the state @xmath8 .",
    "we can ensure that every measurement is certain to produce an outcome by allowing for a null event , @xmath9 , to represent the situation where there is no response .",
    "it follows that the sum of probabilities @xmath10 for all states @xmath11 .",
    "we summarize this by writing @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the constant unit map that sends every state to the number 1 .",
    "the totality of all maps @xmath14 defines the observable measured in the experiment under consideration .",
    "this consideration generalizes as follows .",
    "the set of states of a given type of physical system is modelled as a convex set @xmath0 .",
    "the set @xmath2 of observables is given by a set of affine maps @xmath15 from @xmath0 to the convex set @xmath16 of probability measures over some measurable spaces @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes the set of measurement outcomes and @xmath19 a @xmath20-algebra of subsets of @xmath18 appropriate to each measurement represented in the model .",
    "each observable @xmath21 , together with a subset @xmath22 , gives rise to an affine map @xmath23\\,,\\;\\;\\rho \\mapsto e\\left ( x\\right ) \\left ( \\rho \\right ) = : a\\left ( \\rho \\right ) \\left ( x\\right ) \\equiv e_{\\rho } \\left ( x\\right ) .",

    "the map @xmath25 has the properties of a measure , with normalization @xmath26 , the property @xmath27 ( = the constant zero map which is itself an effect ) , and @xmath20-additivity following from that of all the probability measures @xmath28 .",
    "we see that any observable @xmath21 gives rise to an _ effect valued measure _ @xmath29 .",
    "conversely , every effect valued measure @xmath30 on some measurable space @xmath31 induces an observable @xmath32 as an affine map from @xmath0 to @xmath16 .",
    "we have thus , in effect , two equivalent definitions of an observable .    given the set @xmath1 of observables , we can define the set of all physically realizable effects , denoted @xmath33 , as the union of the ranges of all the effect valued measures associated with the observables in @xmath2 .",
    "this set @xmath33 is thus a subset of the set @xmath34 of _ all _ effects on @xmath0 .",
    "the set @xmath35 inherits a natural partial order defined in @xmath36 as follows : @xmath37 we can thus write @xmath38 $ ] . the set @xmath33 represents the collection of all _ simple _ observables , that is , those with only two outcomes ( also called yes - no observables ) : for @xmath39 , we also have @xmath40 , and the map @xmath41 , @xmath42 defines an effect valued measure on ( the power set of ) @xmath43 .",
    "we can take @xmath1 to be closed under all coarse - grainings of its observables ( understood as restrictions of the associated effect valued measures on @xmath44 to sub-@xmath20-algebras of @xmath45 .",
    "the map @xmath46 defines a kind of complement , or negation , and one can consider a definition of weak orthogonality of effects : @xmath47 if @xmath48 . this relation is not an orthocomplement since one can have pairs of effects satisfying @xmath49 while both have a common nonzero lower bound , @xmath50 . with the partial operation @xmath51 the set of effects @xmath52assumes the structure of an _ effect algebra_.",
    "the connection between effect algebras and statistical models has been thoroughly analyzed by beltrametti and bugajski@xcite and independently by gudder.@xcite    we will make the assumption that the set of physical effects @xmath33 separates @xmath0 , that is : for any two different @xmath53 , there is an effect @xmath39 such that @xmath54 .",
    "this is a natural assumption and can be satisfied by identifying all states that would otherwise be indistinguishable .",
    "we then summarize these consideration by defining a _ statistical model _ as a pair @xmath55 consisting of a convex set of states and a separating set of physical effects .",

    "then , for @xmath61 , the map @xmath62 is a linear functional on @xmath60 , which implies that @xmath63 is injectively embedded into @xmath64 .",

    "we begin with an ` unsuccessful ' attempt , one which nevertheless has provided important insights into the structure of quantum mechanics .",
    "the question of classical representations of quantum mechanics is as old as quantum mechanics itself : already in born s famous paper of 1926 introducing the probability interpretation@xcite , the question of extensions of quantum mechanics in the framework of a classical theory with hidden variables was raised .",
    "a few years later , wigner@xcite attempted to establish a phase space formulation of quantum mechanics and found an injective ( in fact isometric ) affine map @xmath220 of the density operators @xmath11 of a quantum particle to integrable and normalized functions of phase space .",
    "this map yields the correct marginal position and momentum distributions associated with each @xmath11 , but the functions @xmath221 are _ not _ nonnegative ( apart from a ` few ' exceptions such as gaussian wave functions ) .",

    "the dual map sends classical effects to quantum effects ; in particular it takes the ` crisp ' ( sharp ) effects represented by characteristic functions to the effects in the range of the povm @xmath225 associated with @xmath21 : @xmath226 among the quantum observables @xmath21 there are injective ones , and the associated effect valued measures ( or povms ) are called informationally complete . if @xmath225 is informationally complete , the dual map @xmath227 sends the dual space of @xmath228 onto a dense subspace of the space of bounded selfadjoint operators ( the dual of the space of selfadjoint trace class operators hosting @xmath127 ) .",
    "however , the set of measurable classical effects which arises as the convex hull of all @xmath229 can never exhaust , or be dense in , the set of quantum effects @xmath230 : this is due to the fact that for an informationally complete povm , the effects @xmath231 can not be projections other than @xmath232 or @xmath161 .",
    "this means that an informationally complete observable @xmath21 does not induce a ` good ' classical embedding of the full quantum statistical model @xmath185 but only of a reduced quantum model @xmath233 , with @xmath33 replaced by @xmath234 , the separating effect algebra consisting of the range ( or the convex hull of the range ) of the povm @xmath225 .",
    "an example of an informationally complete observable is given by the coherent state based phase space povm , which corresponds to the husimi distribution functions associated with each quantum state .",
    "these are bona fide phase space probability densities but the price to be paid is that its marginal position and momentum distributions are convolutions of the standard quantum mechanical position and momentum distributions with gaussian confidence distributions , thus ensuring that appropriate heisenberg uncertainty relations for the inaccuracies are satisfied .",
    "wigner s theorem can thus be interpreted as a demonstration of the incompatibility of the standard position and momentum observables , while the existence of the husimi and other , similar phase space distributions shows that joint measurements of position and momentum are possible if an allowance is made for unsharpness in line with the uncertainty relation .",
    "informationally complete observables for @xmath134 are easily constructed@xcite , together with simple , realizable measurement schemes.@xcite geometrically , they can be represented as affine embeddings of the poincar sphere @xmath167 into the set @xmath235 . with the choice",
    "@xmath136 one can ensure that the embedding is not only injective but that its linear extension is surjective . in this case the sphere @xmath170 is mapped onto an ellipsoid which is embedded into the tetrahedron @xmath236 . the dual map sends the hypercube @xmath237 into a ` stretched ' hypercube inside the ` diamond ' @xmath175 , in such a way that the elements @xmath238 and @xmath239 [ which represent the @xmath161 and @xmath232 effects ] are mapped to @xmath240 and @xmath241 , respectively .",
