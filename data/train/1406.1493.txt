    "we consider a two - dimensional velocity field @xmath0 , with @xmath1 labeling the location within a two - dimensional region @xmath2 of interest and with @xmath3 referring to time .",
    "fluid trajectories generated by @xmath0 are denoted @xmath4 ) , with @xmath5 referring to the initial position of the trajectory at time @xmath6 .",
    "these trajectories solve the differential equation @xmath7 and generate the flow map @xmath8 which takes an initial position @xmath5 at time @xmath6 to its current position at time @xmath3 .",
    "the right cauchy  green strain tensor field associated with the flow map is defined as @xmath9 , with eigenvalues @xmath10 and eigenvectors @xmath11 satisfying @xmath12 in @xcite we sought the time @xmath6 positions of lagrangian vortex boundaries as closed stationary curves of the averaged lagrangian strain .",
    "such curves turned out to coincide with the zero - energy solutions of a one - parameter family of variational problems defined as @xmath13 here the strain energy functional @xmath14 is defined through the generalized green  lagrange strain tensor family @xmath15 .",
    "\\label{eq : elambda}\\ ] ]    consider the flow domain @xmath16 where the tensor field @xmath17 has two nonzero eigenvalues of opposite sign .",
    "then the quadratic function @xmath18 defines a lorentzian metric @xcite on @xmath19 , with signature @xmath20 inherited from the eigenvalue configuration of @xmath17 .",
    "the zero - energy solutions of ( [ eq : qdef-1 ] ) are therefore precisely the closed null - geodesics of the lorentzian metric @xmath21 , which satisfy one of the two differential equations @xmath22 in @xcite we concluded that closed orbits of ( [ eq : ode-1 ] ) ( termed _ closed @xmath23-lines _ ) must necessarily encircle metric singularities of @xmath21 .",
    "such singularities occur at points @xmath5 where @xmath24 holds for the eigenvalues of the cauchy ",
    "green strain tensor .",
    "the lorentzian metric interpretation discussed above implies a geometric analogy between coherent lagrangian vortex boundaries and photon spheres in cosmology .",
    "below we give more detail on this analogy , followed by an improved version of its summary with a more relevant reference .",
    "in the vicinity of any @xmath23-line in @xmath19 , the vector fields @xmath25 define a curvilinear coordinate system with pointwise orthogonal coordinate lines .",
    "direct substitution of @xmath25 into the metric ( [ eq : g ] ) gives @xmath26 showing that @xmath27 and @xmath28 everywhere in @xmath29 .",
    "this shows that @xmath30-trajectories form the time - like coordinates and the @xmath31-trajectories form the space - like coordinates of the metric @xmath21 in @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "we further note that @xmath32 , and hence a @xmath23-line is _ nowhere space - like _ in the language of lorentzian geometry . given that our closed null - geodesics are nowhere space - like hypersurfaces built out of null - geodesics , they are _ photon surfaces _ by the general definition of @xcite .",
    "next we note that @xmath33 consequently , trajectories of the @xmath34 line field ( @xmath30 coordinate lines ) intersect any closed @xmath23-line @xmath35 transversally , with an angle of intersection that is always less than @xmath36 , as sketched qualitatively in figure [ fig : proj ] . in the same figure , we also show a representative trajectory of the @xmath37 line field ( a @xmath31 coordinate line ) which is pointwise orthogonal to the @xmath30 coordinate lines by construction .",
    "we conclude that the projection of @xmath35 onto a space - like submanifold along the time - like coordinates results in a periodic ( albeit discontinuous ) space - like orbit ( figure [ fig : proj ] )",
    ".     of the lorentizan metric @xmath38 has a periodic space - like projection along the time - like coordinate lines .",
    "this space - like projection has a jump - discontinuity due to the low dimensionality of the space - time , but evolves periodically along with the underlying closed null - geodesic .",
    "this is in contrast to general @xmath23-lines that have aperiodic space - like projections.[fig : proj ] ]    in summary , a closed orbit @xmath35 of the @xmath39 vector field is a photon surface of the @xmath40 space - time .",
    "geodesics forming this photon surface have periodically moving projections on the space - like coordinates , with the projection taken along the time - like coordinate lines .",
    "the orbit @xmath35 , therefore , satisfies a plausible extension of the claudel ",
    "ellis definition of a _ photon sphere _",
    "@xcite from symmetric higher - dimensional space - times to non - symmetric two - dimensional space - times .",
    "this extension relaxes the requirement for a rotational symmetry and smoothness of the projected spatially periodic orbits . both of these features are unattainable in curved , two - dimensional space - times , and hence can be reasonably waived .",
    "in view of the above discussion , the wording of the mathematical analogy between coherent lagrangian eddy boundaries and photon spheres in cosmology ( * ? ? ? * , para .",
