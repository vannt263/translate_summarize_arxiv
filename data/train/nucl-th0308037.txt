    "this is achieved with calculation of @xmath200 performed within the case iii ) for @xmath184 ( nuclear parameter set c ) .",
    "nevertheless , one should keep in mind that the coupling strength of @xcite has been adjusted by using of a deformed nilsson single - particle model and @xmath201 .",

    "we note that that the curves corresponding to cases ii ) and iii ) do change only weakly in the range @xmath202 .",

    "however , for negative value of @xmath165 the correspondance with @xmath204 from systematic studies of the single beta decay @xcite is not achieved .",

    "it is worthwhile to note that the absolute values of @xmath72 and @xmath71 amplitudes are equal each to other in case of the qrpa calculation with spherical mean field .",
    "the phases of these amplitudes are not of physical meaning .",
    "however , the relative phases of corresponding @xmath14 and @xmath15 amplitudes plays a crucial role due to partial destructive character of the contributions from different intermediate states to @xmath107 . in the calculation",

    "there is a different situation .",
    "we see that important contributions to @xmath206 arise even from relatively high energies of the intermediate states around the position of gamow - teller resonance ( about 12 mev ) , which can not be described for a given nuclear system in the framework of the shell model .",
