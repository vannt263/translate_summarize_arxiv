    "coarsening phenomena and pattern formation are fascinating subjects , drawing much attention especially in the context of first order transitions @xcite . though these phenomena are inherently dynamic in nature , there are intimate links to the statics associated with thermal equilibrium .",
    "to be specific , the underlying rules of evolution of this class of systems obey detailed balance ( microscopic reversibility ) ; otherwise , these systems would never reach their equilibrium states .",
    "more recently , considerable attention has been directed at a different class of many - body systems , namely , those which settle into _ non - equilibrium _ steady states . unlike their equilibrium counterparts , these steady states experience net _ fluxes _ ( of , say , energy or particles ) _ through _ the system . as a result ,",
    "their stationary distributions lie in general entirely outside the boltzmann - gibbs paradigm , and most are completely unknown .",
    "nevertheless , these systems are ubiquitous in nature ( including , in particular , _ all _ biological systems ) and deserve our attention .",
    "the main distinguishing feature of non - equilibrium steady states is that they are coupled to more than one energy ( or particle ) reservoir , so that the underlying dynamics _ violates _ detailed balance .",
    "not surprisingly , such systems display much richer behavior than those in thermal equilibrium @xcite . here , we ask a natural question : if such a system undergoes a first - order - like transition , will it also display very different coarsening phenomena ?",
    "in other words , can we expect novel properties in systems evolving under a detailed balance violating dynamics ?    posed in this way , our question is extremely broad and progress towards an answer will not be easy .",
    "one approach to this goal is to study idealized , simple model systems .",
    "the hope is that , by exploring their behavior , we will gain important insight towards the understanding of more complex real systems .",
    "in addition , we may discover universality classes which encompass both simple models and real systems .",
    "the ising model played precisely such a role in the understanding of thermodynamic singularities in an wide class of equilibrium systems . in the same spirit",
    ", we explore coarsening phenomena in a simple lattice gas model , driven into steady states far from thermal equilibrium .",
    "our model is a member of a class known as driven diffusive systems",
    ". introduced by katz , lebowitz and spohn @xcite as a seemingly trivial modification of the ising lattice gas , the prototype displayed many surprising and counterintuitive phenomena . since then , variations and extensions of this simple model have been explored , and rich and complex behavior continues to emerge @xcite .",
    "one recent example is the drastic difference between a strictly one dimensional system ( @xmath1 , also refered to as `` one - lane '' ) and a quasi - one dimensional ( @xmath2 , `` two - lane '' ) lattice gas involving two species of particles @xcite . driven in opposite directions on lattices with periodic boundary conditions ( `` ring roads '' ) , two particles encountering one another may exchange positions with a small exchange rate @xmath3 .",
    "the steady state of the _ one - lane _ model is known analytically @xcite to remain homogeneous at all positive @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the _ average _ particle density or filling fraction . meanwhile ,",
    "monte carlo studies of the _ two - lane _ system showed a transition to an _ _ in__homogeneous state , with a single macroscopic cluster @xcite ( a jammed state ) .",
    "subsequently , simulations and a mean - field theory for a very similar model also indicated such a kind of `` phase transition '' arndt1,arndt2 .",
    "remarkably , an exact solution for this model was established later @xcite , showing that the jammed state is a finite - size effect : two - particle correlations are controlled by a _ finite _ - but gargantuan ( e.g. , @xmath5 ! ) - length scale .",
    "though there are reasons to believe that our model also displays this type of finite - size effect @xcite , it is nevertheless interesting to investigate jamming , and the growth of jams , in finite systems . in particular , if the crossover to the asymptotic behavior does not occur until the system sizes also reach @xmath6 , then it is irrelevant for all conceivable earthbound systems ( e.g. , pedestrian traffic and biological motors ) .    with these considerations in mind ,",
    "we explore coarsening phenomena in the two - lane system , as it evolves toward a jammed state . in a recent study of this model @xcite",
    ", clusters were found to grow much faster than in typical non - driven diffusive systems @xcite . here , we report an in - depth investigation , using both simulation and analytic techniques . focusing on dynamic scaling of the clustering process",
    ", we investigate the average cluster size as a function of time and system size . on the analytic side , we present a set of mean - field equations of motion for the local particle densities .",
    "the numerical solutions of these equations resemble the behavior of the exact solution of the deterministic burgers equation . from the monte carlo simulations , in the small @xmath3 regime",
    ", we find a growth exponent of @xmath7 and good evidence of dynamical scaling .",
    "yet , as @xmath3 increases , we are forced to adjust the scaling exponents in order to collapse the data onto a universal curve .",
    "we believe that these findings provide further evidence for the destabilization of the ordered `` phase '' with increasing @xmath0 or system size .",
    "the model is defined as a stochastic driven lattice gas with random sequential dynamics that conserves the number of particles .",
    "there are two kinds of particles , `` positive '' ( @xmath8 ) and `` negative '' ( @xmath9 ) ones , that perform biased diffusion on an @xmath2 lattice with periodic boundary conditions in both directions .",
    "each site on the lattice can be empty ( @xmath10 ) or occupied by at most one ( positive or negative ) particle .",
    "there are no other interactions between the particles except an excluded volume interaction .",
    "the two species are driven in opposite directions by an external field along the @xmath11-axis , where @xmath12 labels the position of a site `` along the road '' .",
    "the particles can also change lanes ( with @xmath13 being the lane label ) .",
    "one monte carlo step ( mcs ) contains the following steps repeated @xmath14 times :    * randomly pick a bond connecting two nearest - neighbor sites on the lattice ; * if the bond is in the @xmath11-direction and connects either a @xmath15 or a @xmath16 pair , exchange the particle and the vacancy ( a particle - hole exchange ) .",
    "if it is a particle pair @xmath17 , then perform the exchange with probability @xmath3 - a process also referred to as charge - exchange , or passing in the language of traffic models ; * if the bond is in the transverse direction ( cross - lane ) , then exchange particle - hole pairs always and execute charge exchanges with probability @xmath3 .    since no backward jumps are allowed , these dynamical rules can be interpreted as imposing an infinite external `` electric field '' on the `` charged '' particles , which perform random walks _",
    "biased _ only along @xmath18 .",
    "apart from the random choosing of bonds , the only stochastic parameter in the model is the particle - exchange probability @xmath3 .",
    "our dynamics is invariant under spatial translations and charge - parity ( cp ) transformations .",
    "we have studied only the case of a neutral system , i.e. @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the number of @xmath8 and @xmath9 particles respectively .",
    "further , we focus mostly on systems at half filling , i.e. , @xmath22 .",
    "unlike its equilibrium analogue , i.e. , the ising model , there is a qualitative difference between the @xmath2 ( quasi 1-d ) and the @xmath23 ( strictly 1-d ) systems . for the latter case , both the exact solution ( for an infinite system ) @xcite and computer simulations ( of finite systems ) @xcite",
    "show that the steady state is disordered and homogeneous .",
    "specifically , if we define a cluster as a collection of particles connected by nearest - neighbor bonds , then the distribution of cluster sizes is controlled by an exponential with a characteristic length of @xmath24 , remaining finite except in the singular limits @xmath25 or @xmath26 . by contrast , the presence of a second lane has a profound effect on the steady state . for large regions in the @xmath3-@xmath4 plane",
    ", the cluster - size distribution has another peak located at sizes @xmath27 , which is a clear signal of a macroscopic jam @xcite .",
    "this behavior is very counterintuitive : adding a second lane should not lead to worse traffic jams ! according to one s nave expectation ,",
    "the extra degree of freedom associated with the additional lane should provide an efficient mechanism for relieving blockages and allowing the system to reach a more homogeneous state . instead , computer simulations reveal properties more akin to the 2-d system ( @xmath28 ) , where a compact , macroscopic cluster is present in significant portions of the @xmath3-@xmath29 phase diagram .",
    "although the macroscopic cluster in the @xmath30 case is unlikely to persist in the @xmath31 limit georgiev , our focus here is how the system evolves toward a phase - separated state in ( physically reasonable ) @xmath32 s up to @xmath33    just like in the daily commute , for low @xmath3 and moderate @xmath4 , a local blockage will remain long enough for the next group of particles to jam into it . as a result , the blockage grows , as long as the influx , due to the arrival of particles from _ outside _ the cluster , exceeds the outflux , due to the loss of particles from non - zero @xmath3 .",
    "[ fig : l512_sptime ] provides an example of this growth process .",
    "it is a space - time plot of a @xmath34 lattice starting from a random initial configuration .",
    "the overall particle density is @xmath35 ( i.e. @xmath36 ) and the charge - exchange probability is @xmath37 .",
    "each row on the figure encodes the microscopic configuration on the lattice .",
    "time runs vertically downwards , covering the first @xmath38 mcs . for these values of @xmath39 and @xmath3 ,",
    "the system will coarsen until there is only one macroscopic cluster .",
    "the remainder of this paper will be devoted to a more quantitative characterization of this coarsening process . before continuing ,",
    "let us provide some necessary definitions .",
    "first , we define a cluster of size @xmath40 as any @xmath40 particles connected by nearest - neighbor bonds regardless of their charge ( i.e. , a `` mass '' cluster ) . by collecting a histogram of cluster sizes formed at time @xmath41",
    ", we can estimate the probability @xmath42 of having a cluster with a mass @xmath40 at time @xmath41 .",
    "since @xmath43 is not a conserved distribution , it is customary to study the residence distribution , defined as @xmath44 .",
    "representing the probability that a randomly chosen particle belongs to a cluster of size @xmath40 at time @xmath41 , this distribution is easily normalized , i.e. , @xmath45 .",
    "the steady - state residence distribution @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 . in the 1-lane system , it is monotonically decreasing and , in the thermodynamic limit , known analytically : @xmath48 @xcite , where @xmath49 is a characteristic mass independent of @xmath32 .",
    "however , for the 2-lane model , @xmath50 changes from being monotonic for larger values of @xmath3 to being bi - modal for small @xmath3 ( and moderate @xmath51 ) .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ res_dist ] , where @xmath52 and @xmath3 takes two values , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . for the larger @xmath3",
    ", @xmath50 is similar to the 1-lane case . for the smaller value",
    ", @xmath50 has a second peak at @xmath55 , associated with the macroscopic cluster .",
    "meanwhile , the peak at @xmath56 can be traced to the region _ _",
    "outside _ _ this cluster , where a very low particle density allows only for very small blockages ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "we refer to the particles in this region as `` travellers '' ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : l512_sptime ] ) .",
    "further details about the stationary states and the @xmath3-@xmath4 phase diagram can be found in @xcite .",
    "in a preliminary study of coarsening in this model @xcite , systems up to @xmath58 with @xmath59 were simulated .",
    "the main observation is that the cluster sizes appear to grow roughly as @xmath60 . here ,",
    "we report the results of a refined study using a fast multi - spin coding algorithm where the storage of the microstates on the lattice and the updating rules are coded in a bit - wise manner , as in , say , @xcite .",
    "since our model is a three - state model , we need at least two bits to store the three possible states on a single lattice site . instead of using two consecutive bits in a machine word for encoding the state on a site ,",
    "we prefer to use one bit from two different words . in this way",
    "the algorithm for a single monte carlo step becomes somewhat simpler , though working with two different arrays representing the two lanes reduces the efficiency slightly .",
    "each element of the two arrays represents a particular site on one of the lanes . exploiting the @xmath61-bit architecture of our hardware , the individual bits in the machine word",
    "encode the state on this site for @xmath61 different lattices , all of which are updated simultaneously .",
    "the increase in the efficiency of the multi - spin algorithm is roughly @xmath62-fold over the standard single spin flip algorithm .",
    "this allows us to study much larger systems and provides much better statistics .",
    "[ res_distr_time ] shows the behavior of the residence distribution @xmath63 on a @xmath64 lattice with @xmath59 and particle density @xmath65 . in the regime from @xmath66 to @xmath67 mcs , seemingly unbounded coarsening occurs .",
    "thereafter , the largest cluster saturates the system size and the system settles into a steady state .",
    "two components of @xmath68 are easily distinguished , corresponding to a relatively static mode near the origin associated with the travelers , and a more `` dynamic '' mode associated with the growing clusters . since these modes exhibit drastically different time dependences ,",
    "the full distribution can not be collapsed on a single universal curve .",
    "we can , however , isolate the `` growing '' component by introducing a coarse - grained description of the growth process @xcite .",
    "we define a strictly one - dimensional coarse - grained configuration on a @xmath23 chain as follows :  ( i ) for a suitably chosen positive integer @xmath69 , center a @xmath70 window at each site @xmath12 with , say , @xmath71 of the original lattice and count the number of particles inside the window ; ( ii ) if this particle number exceeds @xmath69 , we occupy the associated site @xmath11 on the ( coarse - grained )  @xmath1 lattice ; otherwise , that site remains empty .",
    "clearly , this procedure is independent of @xmath72 , i.e. , which lane is selected .",
    "since the small clusters in the traveler region rarely exceed a mass of @xmath73 , we use windows of length @xmath74 . as a result",
    ", the traveler component is removed from the coarse - grained configuration which contains only the information about the growth mode .",
    "since large clusters are almost unaffected by the coarse - graining procedure , it should be obvious that the large - scale dynamics on the new @xmath1 lattice has the same characteristics as the original system .",
    "the coarse - graining procedure is performed each time we take data , and the information about the lengths of clusters on the new lattice is collected .",
    "the coarse - grained residence distribution , @xmath75 , on the new lattice is defined as before , namely , as the ( normalized ) probability that a randomly chosen particle belongs to a cluster of length @xmath76 at time @xmath41 .",
    "the average cluster length @xmath77 is defined as its first moment :   @xmath78 in the following , we show two large data sets for @xmath79 vs. @xmath41 obtained from @xmath80 independent runs , on lattices with @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , and @xmath35 .",

    "to analyze the data , we test whether they satisfy dynamic scaling of the form : @xmath87this scaling form is chosen to reflect two features of our data . on the one hand , on any given lattice , we expect a saturation of cluster sizes for large times , so that @xmath88 should become independent of time . in other words ,",
    "the scaling function @xmath89 should approach a constant as @xmath90 .",

    "the stationary distribution is still bi - modal but the peak at large @xmath40 is already very broad .",
    "while the data collapse for the coarsening system is still very good , a value of @xmath110 shows that the largest clusters already scale sublinearly with @xmath32 .",

    "to summarize , for small values of @xmath3 ( i.e. @xmath113 ) , the system coarsens with a growth exponent @xmath108 consistent with @xmath7 , and approaches a steady state characterized by a single macroscopic cluster , with @xmath114 . as @xmath3 increases ,",

    "first , all initial conditions are random ; second , and more importantly , the dynamics itself is inherently stochastic . even starting from the same initial condition , each monte carlo run follows a distinct trajectory .",
    "it is natural to ask whether the statistical averaging over these different trajectories is essential for the coarsening process . to put this question into context , we recall that thermal fluctuations play no role for the temporal evolution of equilibrium systems towards their final ordered states , provided the domain size is much larger than the thermal correlation length @xcite . as a result",
    ", domain growth laws can be obtained by integrating a deterministic mean - field equation , e.g. , the cahn - hilliard equation for the ordering dynamics of a scalar conserved order parameter ( model b , in the hohenberg - halperin classification @xcite ) .    in this section ,",
    "we neglect fluctuations , in an attempt to test their relevance .",
    "we establish evolution equations for the two particle densities which form the analogue of the cahn - hilliard equation for our dynamics and integrate them numerically .",
    "the only source of noise will be in the initial condition ; once it is set , the evolution proceeds completely deterministically .",
    "if we recover a growth exponent of @xmath7 , we may conclude that the stochasticity of the monte carlo simulations is irrelevant .",
    "in contrast , if a different growth exponent emerges here , we are faced with a stark difference between coarsening towards an equilibrium vs a non - equilibrium steady state , namely , that fluctuations are essential to describe coarsening phenomena in the latter .    to obtain a set of evolution equations , we begin from the microscopic master equation and derive equations for the local averages , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , of positive and negative particles at lattice site @xmath117 and time @xmath41 .",

    ", the mean - field @xmath177 behaves very similarly to its monte carlo counterpart .",
    "it slowly approaches a limiting value @xmath178 before the system reaches steady state .",
    "as in the mc simulations , the limiting value `` creeps up '' as the number of space discretization points ( the system size ) increases , so that the mean - field results appear to be are consistent with a growth exponent of @xmath7 .",
    "let us conclude this section by discussing a few simple analytic attempts towards computing the growth exponent .",
    "none of them generate a satisfactory estimate of the growth exponent , whence we conclude that its origin may be quite subtle . taking our clues from the monte carlo simulations , we note that particles spend only a negligeable amount of time in transit between clusters . moreover , the density of travellers remains approximately constant in time .",
    "it seems therefore reasonable to focus on the sizes ( lengths ) of the clusters only .",
    "these evolve as neighboring clusters exchange particles . starting from the strictly one - dimensional coarse - grained configurations described in section ( [ mc ] ) ,",
    "the simplest representation of a sequence ( @xmath179 ) of clusters is to specify their lengths , @xmath180 , and the net positive and negative particle currents , @xmath181 , which flow through them . assuming that cluster @xmath182 gains positive ( negative )  particles from its left ( right ) neighbor and loses them to its right ( left )  neighbor , we may write @xmath183   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\]]clearly , an overall constant cancels on the right hand side , so that only the @xmath76-dependent _ excess _ currents contribute .",
    "if we assume that the cluster interiors are nearly `` equilibrated '' in the latest stages of the growth process and invoke the mean - field result @xmath184 , simple scaling gives us @xmath185 or @xmath186 .",
    "this clearly produces a poor estimate ( @xmath187 ) for the growth exponent .",
    "a somewhat better  but still unsatisfactory  estimate can be obtained if we replace the mean - field expression for the currents by its exact counterpart .",
    "to do so , we recall that the cluster interiors are almost entirely free of holes so that the dynamics inside the clusters is dominated by @xmath188 exchanges , following a totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep )  @xcite .",
    "the associated excess currents are exactly known :  @xmath189 .",
    "simple scaling now yields @xmath190 which is faster than the mean - field estimate but still slower than the observed @xmath60 behavior .",
    "we note briefly that the same exponent ( @xmath191 ) results from a representation of the cluster growth process in terms of coalescing but otherwise noninteracting random walkers @xcite .",
    "we believe that the deficiencies of these approaches can be traced , by monitoring the evolution of our clusters , to the rapid and systematic disintegration of small ones . while this bias towards larger clusters can be modelled in an ad hoc ( but quantitatively very accurate ) fashion by introducing appropriate interactions between the walkers @xcite , we have as yet no reliable insight into the physical origin of these interactions",
    ".    finally , let us offer an intuitive picture which may provide some hints towards a growth exponent of @xmath7 .",
    "first , the strongest evidence for this value results from simulations with small @xmath3 .",
    "this suggests a time scale separation between the dynamics of the traveller domains , dominated by fast particle - hole exchanges , and the cluster regions , controlled by charge exchanges on a much slower time scale set by @xmath192 .",
    "this is clearly reflected in the mean - field currents , eqs .",
    "( [ mft - trav ] ) and ( mft - cluster ) . in other words",
    ", particles spend only very brief periods travelling from one cluster to the next , compared to the time required to traverse a large cluster from one end to the other .",
    "moreover , the microscopic dynamics within the interior of clusters is a simple tasep which can be described , under very well - defined conditions @xcite , by the deterministic burgers equation @xcite .",
    "it is therefore tempting to neglect the traveller regions and to think of the sequence of clusters in terms of coarsening burgers shocks . in this context",
    ", it is well known burgers that the average distance of shocks grows as @xmath60 , provided an average over random initial conditions is taken .",
    "of course , this reasoning remains a conjecture until a more rigorous analytic formulation can be found .",
    "to summarize , we have analyzed a coarsening phenomenon in a two - species driven diffusive system on an @xmath2 periodic lattice .",
    "positive ( negative )  particles hop in the positive ( negative )  @xmath11-direction with rate @xmath193 , provided the destination site is empty . if it is filled by a particle of opposite charge , the exchange occurs with rate @xmath194 .",
    "cross - lane exchanges are unbiased .",
    "since @xmath194 , two opposing particles impede each other , resulting in a temporary local blockage . for sufficiently small @xmath3 , or sufficiently high overall particle density , these local jams aggregate ( `` coarsen '' ) into a macroscopic cluster which characterizes the final steady state of finite systems .",
    "a simple interpretation of this dynamics is traffic of fast and slow cars on a two - lane ring road , viewed from a co - moving frame .    using monte carlo simulations and the numerical integration of a set of mean - field equations , we study how an initially random distribution of particles evolves to this inhomogeneous steady state , i.e.",
    ", we quantify the coarsening process in which local blockages form larger and larger clusters . measuring the average cluster size , @xmath77 , as a function of time ,",
    "both methods indicate power law growth @xmath195 with a growth exponent @xmath196 for the late stages of growth .",
    "in fact , monte carlo simulations show excellent data collapse for small @xmath3 and a range of system sizes if @xmath197 is plotted vs @xmath198 .",
    "however , as @xmath3 increases , the scaling exponents have to be adjusted to achieve a comparable quality of data collapse .",
    "we interpret this as further evidence for the observation that the inhomogeneous stationary state will not survive in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "since the stationary properties of the @xmath1 system can be rigorously mapped @xcite into an exactly solvable one - dimensional zero - range process ( zrp )  @xcite involving one species of particles , it is natural to compare our findings to recent results for the coarsening dynamics of such models @xcite .",
    "they are defined on a chain of sites , each of which can be occupied by an integer number , @xmath199 of particles .",
    "the hopping rate @xmath200 of a given particle depends only on the number , @xmath201 , of particles located at the originating site . under well - defined conditions on the @xmath202 , the density in the bulk",
    "is limited to a critical value , and excess particles accumulate ( `` condense '' )  at a non - extensive fraction of sites @xcite .",
    "cluster sites are then defined as those sites where a macroscopic fraction of particles has accumulated @xcite . as the system approaches the final stationary state ,",
    "one monitors how the average number of particles at these cluster sites grows with time .",
    "two basic universality classes can be distinguished :  if the @xmath200 are symmetric , i.e. , particles hop to the right and left with equal rates , the dynamic exponent is found to be @xmath203 , resulting in a growth exponent @xmath204 . in contrast , if the particle hopping is biased , the growth occurs faster , with @xmath205 and @xmath191 .",
    "clearly , both of these are incompatible with our results .",
    "we note that growth exponents of @xmath206 can be `` engineered '' in one - dimensional zrps involving _ two _ species of particles @xcite , but only for very special rates which break a fundamental symmetry of our dynamics , mainly , cp invariance .",
    "hence , we believe that there is little to learn from these results for our case . clearly , the fast coarsening observed here , compared to growth exponents of @xmath187 or @xmath207 indicates that some essential characteristics of our dynamics can not be captured in the simple zrp picture . at this point , we can only speculate what these features might be .",
