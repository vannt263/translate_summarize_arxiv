    "there exist several hints of oscillatory signals in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observables , such as power spectrum @xcite and bispectrum @xcite .",
    "this motivates a search for such kind of features produced by inflationary scenarios beyond canonical single - field .. ] several mechanisms that produce oscillatory features have been realized , such as a transient reduction in the speed of sound @xcite , step inflaton potential @xcite , different initial vacuum states @xcite , multi - field dynamics @xcite , or phenomenological superimposed oscillations in the primordial power spectrum @xcite . in this work we focus on searching for oscillatory features in the scenario of a transient reduction in the speed of sound .",
    "the effect of a variable speed of sound has also been analyzed both in the power spectrum @xcite and bispectrum @xcite .",
    "similar studies of power spectrum @xcite and bispectrum @xcite have also been done for models with sudden variations .",
    "in addition , the planck collaboration searched for features in the cmb bispectrum for a number of theoretically motivated templates @xcite , including oscillatory templates .",
    "although in none of these cases the statistical significance of the extended models has been found to be high enough to claim a detection , with the improvement of experimental accuracy we are now at the threshold of verifying or falsifying these models .",
    "our test case , introduced in @xcite , consists of a gaussian reduction in the speed of sound occurring within the window of @xmath0-folds corresponding to the angular scales probed by cmb and large - scale structure ( lss ) surveys .",
    "its functional form is consistent with a reduction in the speed of sound resulting from a soft turn along the inflationary trajectory in a multi - field theory in which the mass hierarchy is large enough to allow for an effective single - field description @xcite ( though one should keep in mind that a similar reduction in the speed of sound may result from a different high - energy completion of the effective field theory ) .",
    "since it is the same curvature perturbations that set the initial conditions for cmb anisotropies and large - scale structure distributions , the primordial oscillatory signals should be imprinted in all the observables of cmb anisotropy and lss tracers , like cmb spectra , bispectra , galaxy spectra , etc .",
    "based on this consideration , in this paper we search for primordial oscillatory features from a transient reduction in the speed of sound of adiabatic curvature perturbations via both cmb anisotropy temperature - temperature spectrum of the planck satellite as well as galaxy distribution spectrum of the wigglez telescope .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ review ] , we will briefly review the theoretical setup of the transient reductions in the speed of sound . in sec .",
    "[ method ] , we will introduce the methodology of parameter estimation and model selection which is adopted in this work as well as the data sets used .",
    "then , we arrive at our results and discuss them in sec .  [ discussion ] .",
    "finally , we conclude in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "in the framework of effective field theory , heavy fields coupled to the inflaton reduce the speed of sound of the adiabatic mode each time the background inflationary trajectory makes a turn . in reference",
    "@xcite , achcarro _ et al .",
    "_  prove how small but abrupt changes in the speed of sound of the adiabatic mode during inflation , independently of their physical origin , seed discriminable features in the primordial power spectrum and bispectrum .",
    "defining @xmath1 , at first order in this quantity a small transient reduction in the speed of sound produces a feature in the primordial scalar curvature power spectrum of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the featureless power spectrum with constant speed of sound @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the conformal time",
    ". the corresponding feature in the primordial bispectrum can also be found in @xcite , and its calculation is valid in the perturbative regime of small @xmath6 . in the whole framework , it is assumed that the effect of the reduction in the speed of sound in both spectrum and bispectrum dominates over slow roll contributions .",
    "both perturbativity and dominance over slow roll effects set bounds for the shape and the size of speed of sound reduction as @xmath7    in this paper , following references @xcite , we search for reductions in the speed of sound which take the form of a gaussian in @xmath0-folds @xmath8 : u=1-c_s^-2=be^-(n - n_0)^2=be^-()^2  , [ eq : gaussefolds ] where we have introduced the parameters of the feature : the amplitude @xmath9 , the sharpness @xmath10 , and the instant of maximal reduction @xmath11 ( or @xmath12).-folds time scale are related by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the value of the scale factor when there were @xmath15 @xmath0-folds left until the end of inflation  we take here @xmath16 . ]",
    ".   imposes limits on the maximum and minimum values of the first two parameters , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , while @xmath19 , from the theoretical point of view , lacks a lower bound .",
    "one can set more conservative bounds on those parameters by imposing that the feature falls within the observable window of inflation in the cmb @xmath20 , and it is at the same time sharp enough and oscillates with large enough a frequency not to be degenerated with the cosmological parameters . if @xmath21 are the first 7 @xmath0-folds of the last @xmath22 of inflation , the constaints take the form @xcite    [ eq : bounds ] @xmath23    that observability constraint sets in particular the lower limit of @xmath18 and both limits of @xmath11 , giving bounds which are more conservative than the theoretical ones .",
    "finally , the actual range of @xmath19 is further reduced to lie in the range @xmath24 , motivated by a search for oscillatory features in the primordial bispectrum @xcite .",
    "in this paper we solve the einstein - boltzmann hierarchy by using camb @xcite and sample the parameter space using different approaches in order to fulfil two different purposes . on one hand , for parameter estimation , we use the thermodynamic markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) sampler , cosmomc @xcite . in detail",
    ", we use a metropolis - hastings algorithm to generate chains of samples for a set of cosmological parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "for bayesian evidence computation and model selection , we adopt the multimodal nested sampler , multinest @xcite which implements an extended form of the nested sampling algorithm @xcite .",
    "this is because the dependence of the evidence on the prior requires that the prior space is adequately sampled , even in the regions of low likelihood .",
    "this makes evidence evaluation at least an order of magnitude more costly than parameter estimation .    in what follows",
    "we make a brief review of the concepts of evidence and bayesian ratio .",
    "the bayesian ratio is defined as the ratio of the probabilities of each of the two models conditioned on a given set of data @xmath25 : @xmath26 here , @xmath27 is the probability ratio for the two models _ a priori _ , which is conventionally set to unity ; the _ evidence _ @xmath28 of a model @xmath29 is the marginalized likelihood of the data , i.e.  the probability of having obtained the data @xmath25 integrated over all possible values of the model parameters @xmath30 : @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are , respectively , the likelihood of the data , the prior of the parameters in the model and the dimensionality of the parameter space . in this work , we will use @xmath35 and @xmath36 to denote the feature and featureless @xmath37 models;cdm denotes the 6-parameter base model considered by the planck collaboration @xcite . ]",
    "the cosmological parameter ranges we studied are listed in tab.[tab : parameters ] . and the multidimensional integration in eq .",
    "was sampled via the multi - modal implementation of the nested sampling algorithm multinest @xcite .",
    ".[tab : parameters ] list of the parameters used in the multimodal nested sampling . besides these parameters , we also sample and marginalise over the fourteen nuisance parameters of the planck likelihood and one bias parameter of the wigglez likelihood . we have sampled @xmath17 up to @xmath38 , but nothing interesting was found beyond the upper value cited in this table .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper we searched for primordial oscillatory signals inspired by a transient reduction in the sound speed of the adiabatic curvature perturbation via cmb ( planck ) and lss ( wigglez ) windows .",
    "first of all , by analysing both data sets separately , we found some common oscillatory patterns both in the planck cmb temperature - temperature power spectrum and the wigglez galaxy spectrum .",
    "interestingly , we found a coincidence in the most significant mode previously found by achcarro _",
    "_  2013 @xcite by using only planck data .",
    "second , the joint data analysis showed that the oscillation frequency of the feature gets better constrained , and the amplitude marginally deviates from zero , unlike what was observed by using only planck data .",
    "besides parameter estimation , we also calculated the bayesian evidence for the purpose of model selection by using multimodal nested sampling .",
    "the results suggest that there exist a slightly positive preference for the feature model , bayesian factor @xmath39 vs.  @xmath40 .",
    "however , according to jeffreys s criterion it means _ barely worth mentioning_.    despite the coincidence between both data sets , we notice that the addition of lss data does not lead to significantly higher predictivity . in theory",
    ", the galaxy surveys , compared with the cmb measurements , should be more robust at constraining features existing on scales between tens and hundreds of , due to the fact that matter perturbations are not damped inside the sound horizon at the epoch of recombination , while they are in the photon temperature anisotropies .",
    "nevertheless , with the present sky coverage of lss surveys , the sample variance still dominates the uncertainties on the large scales . in order to reach a sensitivity level similar to planck s ,",
    "we need full - sky coverage and deep redshift galaxy surveys , such as _ euclid_.    the bayesian evidence analysis shows that although there exists a relatively large improvement in the likelihood value ( @xmath41 ) in several particular parameter regimes , due to the relatively large number of extra parameters ( @xmath42 ) and their broad ranges of variation ( look - elsewhere effect ) , the present planck temperature - temperature and wigglez matter power spectra data still lack significance to claim a detection . however , due to the correlations between temperature and polarization modes of the power spectrum and the correlations with the bispectra given by the model of transient reductions in the speed of sound , the present results have specific _ predictions _ for the te cross - correlation spectrum ( @xmath43 ) @xcite and the temperature bispectrum ( @xmath44 ) @xcite . particularly , the new fast bispectrum estimator of oscillatory features from @xcite should be able to cover the frequency where the most significant mode that we found is located .",
    "if those predictions are right , these signals in polarisation spectra and temperature bispectrum may be observed with the upcoming planck data release in 2015 , though it is by now unclear whether the sensitivity level of the planck full - mission data will be high enough to claim a detection .    in the light of the additional wigglez data , we update the predictions stated in @xcite , based on the high correlation between the bispectrum features studied there and the phenomenological oscillatory shape tested by the planck collaboration and given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "( 16 ) ) .. ] in the parameters used by the planck collaboration , we expect to find a feature with zero phase , and wavelength in the @xmath45 c.l .",
    "interval @xmath46 from mode @xmath47 , _ or _",
    "@xmath48 from mode @xmath49 .",
    "as happened when using only planck data @xcite , a degeneracy between @xmath17 and @xmath50 prevents us from setting accurate predictions for the amplitude and envelope of the feature .",
    "nevertheless , for all values of the parameters along the degeneracy , the signal is most significant on the scales beyond the second acoustic peak , and reaches its maximum around the third or fourth peak .",
