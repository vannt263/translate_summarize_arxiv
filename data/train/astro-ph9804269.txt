    "strong gamma - ray emission in the 3 - 7 mev range has been detected from the orion molecular cloud complex with the comptel instrument on the _ compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro _ ; bloemen et al .",
    "1994 , 1997 ) . as the observed spectrum exhibits characteristic structures ( bloemen et al .",
    "1997 ) , this emission is most likely due to the superposition of nuclear gamma - ray lines , mainly the 4.44 mev line from @xmath0c and the 6.13 , 6.92 and 7.12 mev lines from @xmath1o .",
    "such line emission can only be produced by accelerated particle interactions .",
    "gamma - ray emission at photon energies @xmath230 mev was also observed from orion , with the egret instrument on _ cgro _ ( digel , hunter , & mukherjee 1995 ) .",
    "this gamma - ray emission is consistent with pion production and bremsstrahlung due to irradiation by standard galactic cosmic rays ( digel et al .",
    "1995 ) . as such cosmic rays",
    "underproduce the observed line emission by at least three orders of magnitude , the gamma - ray line production in orion must predominantly be a low energy cosmic ray phenomenon .",
    "information on the spatial distribution of the gamma - ray line emission in orion has come from both the comptel and _ cgro_/osse observations .",
    "the extended nature of the emission seen in the comptel map of orion ( bloemen et al .",
    "1997 ) could provide an explanation for the fact that so far it was not possible to confirm the comptel results with osse ( murphy et al .",
    "1996 ; harris et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "based on the observed line widths , bloemen et al .",
    "( 1994 ) first suggested that the line emission is produced by accelerated c and o ions interacting with ambient h and he , rather than by accelerated protons and @xmath3-particles interacting with ambient c and o. more detailed analyses of the initial comptel data have shown that a mix of the two processes could not be ruled out ( ramaty , kozlovsky , & lingenfelter 1995 ; cowsik & friedlander 1995 ) .",
    "but , as the emission peaks in the more recent comptel data do not appear at the line center energies for @xmath0c and @xmath1o de - excitations ( bloemen et al .",
    "1997 ) , a significant narrow - line contribution from accelerated proton and @xmath3-particle interactions seems to be excluded ( kozlovsky , ramaty , & lingenfelter 1997 ) .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by energetic arguments , as the very large power deposited by the accelerated particles into the ambient medium in orion is lowered by enhancing the c - to - proton and o - to proton abundance ratios ( ramaty et al .",
    "1995 ; ramaty , kozlovsky & lingenfelter 1996 ) .",
    "apart from the observed emission in the 3 - 7 mev band , the comptel observations revealed only upper limits at other gamma - ray energies ( bloemen et al .",
    "1994 , 1997 ) .",
    "in particular , the upper limit on the 1 - 3 mev emission sets constraints on the accelerated ne - fe abundances relative to those of c and o. the suppression of both the ne - fe and proton and @xmath3-particle abundances relative to c and o could be understood if the seed particles injected into an as - yet unknown particle accelerator ( see nath & biermann 1994 ; bykov & bloemen 1994 ) come from the winds of massive stars or the ejecta of supernovae resulting from massive progenitors ( bykov & bloemen 1994 ; ramaty et al . 1995 ; cass , lehoucq , & vangioni - flam 1995 ; ramaty et al .",
    "1996 ; parizot , cass , & vangioni - flam 1997a ) .",
    "ip ( 1995 ) and ramaty et al . (",
    "1996 ) have also considered the possible acceleration of ions resulting from the breakup of interstellar dust .",
    "the gamma - ray line production in orion should be accompanied by a large ionization rate of the ambient medium which could exceed the observed infrared luminosity ( cowsik & friedlander 1995 ) .",
    "this problem is alleviated if the gamma - rays are produced at cloud boundaries , but not in their interiors .",
    "the accelerated particles could have ionized @xmath42@xmath510@xmath6m@xmath7 in 10@xmath8 years ( ramaty 1996 ) , a small fraction of the total available mass .",
    "it is thus possible that a large fraction of the power that accompanies the gamma - ray production is deposited in an ionized gas .",
    "while the x - ray emission produced by low energy particle interactions is potentially a promising tracer of low energy cosmic rays in the galaxy ( e.g. hayakawa & matsuoka 1964 ) , there are as - yet no astrophysical x - ray observations that unambiguously indicate the presence of such cosmic rays .",
    "the orion region , however , has become an interesting target owing to the comptel discovery of the nuclear gamma - ray line emission .",
    "a variety of processes lead to x - ray production by low energy ion interactions .",
    "inverse bremsstrahlung ( boldt & serlemitsos 1969 ) results from the interactions of fast ions and ambient electrons ; secondary electron bremsstrahlung is produced by knock - on electrons accelerated in fast ion interactions ( hayakawa & matsuoka 1964 ) .",
    "both of these processes lead to continuum x - ray emission .",
    "x - ray line emission results from atomic de - excitations in the fast ions following electron capture ( silk & steigman 1969 ; watson 1976 ; pravdo & boldt 1975 ; bussard , ramaty , & omidvar 1978 ) and in ambient ions following inner - shell vacancy creation .",
    "the latter process has not yet been applied to astrophysics .",
    "dogiel et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have recently considered the x - ray emission that should accompany the gamma - ray line production in orion .",
    "they have only considered the secondary electron bremsstrahlung and concluded that the 0.5 - 2 kev emission that accompanies the observed gamma - ray line emission from orion will exceed the upper limits that they derived using rosat observations .",
    "we have subsequently taken into account both continuum processes and line emission from de - excitations in fast o ( ramaty , kozlovsky , & tatischeff 1997a ) and showed that , even though the inverse bremsstrahlung is more important than the secondary electron bremsstrahlung , the total x - ray continuum emission from orion is not inconsistent with the dogiel et al .",
    "( 1997 ) derived rosat upper limit . on the other hand",
    ", we showed that a conflict may exist between that rosat upper limit and the x - ray line emission following electron capture onto fast o nuclei .",
    "however , as we suggested , this conflict could be resolved if the x - ray and gamma - ray lines are produced in an ionized medium or if the current epoch accelerated particle spectrum is suppressed at low energies , for example by energy losses .    in this paper",
    "we present detailed calculations of x - ray continuum and line production by accelerated particle interactions .",
    "the bulk of our treatment is for a steady state , thick target model with a neutral ambient medium .",
    "this is the standard model in which most of the gamma - ray calculations have been carried out ( e.g. ramaty et al . 1996 ) .",
    "but we have also investigated the effects of an ionized ambient medium and a time - dependent model , as these modifications could have important consequences on the predicted x - ray to gamma - ray production ratio . in our treatment of the continuum",
    ", we have supplied the details of the calculations and we have improved the employed cross sections , thereby confirming our previous preliminary results ( ramaty et al .",
    "we have greatly expanded our treatment of x - ray line emission .",
    "we have investigated in detail the atomic physics relevant to line emission from de - excitations in fast o , checking our theoretical calculations against laboratory data whenever available .",
    "we then expanded the treatment to the other abundant accelerated ions ( c , n , ne , mg , si , s and fe ) , and we have also calculated the x - ray line emission produced in ambient ions following inner - shell vacancy creation by the accelerated particles .",
    "we have used the rosat all - sky survey ( snowden et al .",
    "1995 ) to derive the x - ray count rates from the orion region that could be associated with accelerated particle interactions ; the implied fluxes are quite different from the upper limit given by dogiel et al .",
    "the unambiguous future detection of the predicted x - rays produced by accelerated particles in orion , and potentially elsewhere in the galaxy , should provide important new insights into the origin of the low energy cosmic rays whose presence in orion is revealed by the comptel gamma - ray line observations .",
    "we consider a steady state , thick target interaction model in which accelerated particles with given energy spectra and composition are injected at a constant rate into an interaction region of solar composition and produce atomic and nuclear reactions as they slow down to energies below the thresholds of the various reactions .",
    "we perform the calculations in a neutral ambient medium . in  5.1 we discuss the expected modifications for a partially ionized medium and in  5.2 the modifications that could result if the accelerated particle population is allowed to evolve in time .    the thick target x - ray and gamma - ray production rates can be written as ( e.g. ramaty et al . 1996 ) @xmath9 here @xmath10 and @xmath11 range over the accelerated and ambient particle types that contribute to the atomic or nuclear product considered ; @xmath12 is the accelerated particle energy per nucleon ; @xmath13 is the differential injection rate of projectiles of type @xmath10 into the target region , measured in particles ( mev / nucleon)@xmath14s@xmath14 ; @xmath15 is the cross section for the particular reaction considered ; @xmath16 is the proton energy loss rate per g @xmath17 in ambient neutral h ; @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the nuclear charge , mass and velocity of projectiles of type @xmath10 ; @xmath21 $ ] is the equilibrium ionic charge in a neutral ambient medium ( pierce & blann 1968 ) ; @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the densities of ambient h , he and constituent @xmath11 ; and @xmath25 is the proton mass .",
    "we perform calculations with an accelerated particle source spectrum of the form ( ramaty et al . 1996 ) @xmath26 the power law @xmath27 is appropriate for strong shock acceleration in the nonrelativistic region .",
    "the exponential cutoff , introduced by ellison & ramaty ( 1985 ) for solar flare acceleration , could be caused by a finite shock size or finite acceleration time . in the case of orion ,",
    "arguments of energetics require a hard spectrum in the nonrelativistic region ( ramaty et al .",
    "1996 ) , such as that given by equation ( 2 ) with as high a value for the turnover energy ( @xmath28@xmath29100mev / nucleon ) as allowed by the requirement that the high energy gamma - ray emission due to pion decay not be overproduced ( tatischeff , ramaty , & mandzhavidze 1997 ) .",
    "while such values of @xmath28 are reasonable for solar flares , it is not clear that in the case of strong shock acceleration the relevant geometry and time scales for orion will lead to a cutoff at a sufficiently low energy .",
    "alternatively , the acceleration in the nonrelativistic region could be stochastic due to turbulence or an ensemble of weak shocks ( bykov & fleishman 1992 ; bykov 1995 ) .",
    "this mechanism predicts an even harder nonrelativistic spectrum ( @xmath30 ) , and one which steepens at higher energies where the acceleration is due to single weak shocks . because of its simplicity",
    ", we shall use equation ( 2 ) in our subsequent calculations , allowing @xmath28 to vary from 10 to 100 mev / nucleon .",
    "we employ three different compositions for the accelerated particles : crs and wc ( ramaty et al .",
    "1996 , table 1 ) ; and ob ( parizot et al .",
    "1997a , table 1 the ob/0.02 column ) .",
    "crs is the composition of the current epoch galactic cosmic - ray sources , wc is the composition of the winds of wolf - rayet stars of spectral type wc , and ob is the average composition of the winds from ob associations .",
    "the c and o abundances relative to protons , @xmath3-particles and heavier metals are much higher for the wc case than those for the crs case .",
    "for the ob case , these abundances ratios are intermediate between those of the crs and wc cases .",
    "energetic ions produce continuum x - ray emission via both inverse bremsstrahlung ( boldt and serlemitsos 1969 , hereafter ib ) and bremsstrahlung from secondary knock - on electrons ( see also anholt 1985 ) . for nonrelativistic protons interacting in stationary h , the inverse bremsstrahlung",
    "cross section is identical to the bremsstrahlung cross section for electrons of kinetic energy @xmath31 also interacting in stationary h ; here @xmath32 and @xmath25 are the electron and proton masses respectively and @xmath33 is the proton kinetic energy .",
    "we used equation 3bn from koch and motz ( 1959 ) . for heavier ions interacting in an ambient medium consisting of heavier atoms",
    ", we replaced the proton energy @xmath33 by the energy per nucleon of the projectile , @xmath12 , and multiplied the cross section by @xmath34@xmath35 , where @xmath18 and @xmath35 are the fast ion and ambient atom charge numbers , respectively .",
    "the secondary electrons are knock - on electrons which subsequently produce bremsstrahlung by interacting with the ambient atoms .",
    "the angle averaged differential x - ray production cross section for secondary electron bremsstrahlung ( seb ) can be written as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the knock - on cross section for the ejection of an electron of energy @xmath38 by a proton of energy @xmath12 interacting with h ( chu et al .",
    "1981 with corrections at high energies from rudd et al . 1966 and",
    "toburen and wilson 1972 ) ; @xmath39 is equation 3bn of koch and motz ( 1959 ) for electrons of energy @xmath40 interacting with h and radiating a photon of energy @xmath41 ; and @xmath42 is the electron energy loss rate per g @xmath17 in the ambient medium ( berger and seltzer 1982 ) . since @xmath42 scales approximately as @xmath35/@xmath43 , where @xmath43 is the target atomic number , the overall cross section scales as @xmath34@xmath44 . in comparison ,",
    "the ib cross section scales as @xmath34@xmath35 .    in figure  1a",
    "we show our calculated ib and seb cross sections for protons interacting in h and be , and compare our results for be with experimental data ( chu et al .",
    "we see that while for the be target the two calculated cross sections are approximately equal , for the h target the ib cross section dominates ( except at the highest energies ) .",
    "this is the direct consequence of the dependencies of the cross sections on the target charge number @xmath35 derived above . in the case",
    "of the be target we get good agreement with the experimental data at 90@xmath45 , the discrepancy of less than a factor of 2 possibly being due to our angle averaging and contaminations in the experiment , for example compton scattering of gamma rays in the be target .    using equation(1 )",
    "we calculated the ratio of the ib and seb productions as a function of photon energy for an ambient medium with solar abundances , for various values of the characteristic energy @xmath28 [ eq .  ( 2 ) ] , and various accelerated particle compositions .",
    "we find that , as expected , the ratio is practically independent of the accelerated particle composition .",
    "we thus show results only for the crs composition ( figure  1b ) .",
    "we see that , except at the highest energies , the ib - to - seb ratio ranges from about unity to almost 10 , depending on the photon energy and the spectrum of the accelerated particles ( i.e. the value of @xmath28 ) .",
    "x - ray line emission results mainly from 2@xmath46 to 1@xmath47 and 3@xmath46 to 1@xmath47 transitions , in either the fast ions or the ambient atoms , giving rise to k@xmath3 and k@xmath48 x - rays respectively . in the case of the fast ions , the 2@xmath46 and 3@xmath46 states can be populated either by electron capture from ambient atoms ( i.e. charge exchange ) or by excitation of 1@xmath47 electrons for ions having one or two electrons .",
    "we neglected the k@xmath3 and k@xmath48 x - ray production from fast ions having more than two electrons as the collision energy in this case is mostly given to the outer electrons and thus not giving rise to a significant k - shell electron excitation .",
    "the fast ions also produce k - shell vacancies in the ambient atoms ( garcia , fortner , & kavanagh 1973 ; cahill 1980 ) .",
    "we first consider the k x - ray production in fast o.      x - ray line production from fast o has already been treated by pravdo & boldt ( 1975 ) and watson ( 1976 ) .",
    "the latter has considered the interaction of energetic o with only ambient hydrogen .",
    "but , as shown by bussard et al .",
    "( 1978 ) for k@xmath3 x - ray emission from fast fe , heavier ambient elements can not be neglected despite their lower abundances because of the strong dependence of the charge - exchange cross section on the charge of the target nucleus .",
    "pravdo & boldt ( 1975 ) have taken into account the contributions of the heavier elements , but as we shall see , their use of the oppenheimer - brinkman - kramers ( obk ) approximation for the charge - exchange cross section in the form presented by schiff ( 1954 ) gives a poor description of the available experimental data .",
    "the main lines produced by fast o ions result from the 2@xmath46 to 1@xmath47 transitions in h- and he - like projectiles giving rise to k@xmath3 x - rays at 0.65 kev ( o  viii line ) and 0.57 kev ( o  vii line ) , respectively ( matthews et al . 1973 ) .",
    "in addition , we considered the 3@xmath46 to 1@xmath47 transitions , which give rise to non - negligible k@xmath48 x - rays at 0.77 and 0.67 kev , for h- and he - like o ions , respectively ( hopkins et al . 1974 ) .      even though the obk cross section is known to exceed the experimental data by a factor of 10 or more in certain cases , it predicts quite accurately the shape of the measured cross sections versus energy ( e.g. the review of belki , gayet , & salin 1979 ) .",
    "schiff ( 1954 ) has derived a general form for the obk cross section for capture of electrons by fast ions from the ground state of a h - like ion .",
    "this formula is not appropriate to describe electron capture from heavy targets containing many atomic electrons .",
    "nikolaev ( 1967 ) has extended the obk cross section to heavy ion charge exchange , taking into account the complete atomic configuration of the target atoms .",
    "he also derived a semi empirical scaling relation in order to adapt his theoretical result to experimental data .",
    "but subsequent measurements have shown that a discrepancy of a factor of 2 - 3 remains between theory and experiment in some cases ( e.g. ferguson et al . 1973 ) .",
    "thus , instead of using the nikolaev ( 1967 ) semi empirical factor , we normalized the nikolaev cross section to experimental data . in the nikolaev formalism we used the binding energies of the target electrons from sevier ( 1979 ) , and the slater ( 1930 ) rules to take into account the external screening of the nuclear charge by the inner shells .",
    "a compilation of experimental cross sections is shown in figure  2 , together with theoretical calculations .",
    "the closed symbols show k x - ray production cross sections due to charge exchange for fast fully stripped o and f interacting with neutral h ,",
    "he , ar and kr . the solid curves are our fits to these data obtained by using the nikolaev ( 1967 ) formalism to calculate the capture cross sections @xmath49 to all states with principal quantum number @xmath50 .",
    "to take into account the captures which populate the 2@xmath47 metastable state ( which does not lead to k x rays ) , we reduced @xmath49 by 4% based on the calculations of guffey , ellsworth & macdonald ( 1977 ) for o and f projectiles in he .",
    "this small correction , however , is negligible in comparison with the overall normalizing factor of 0.1 that we applied to the calculated curves to fit the data .",
    "the open symbols show the total electron capture cross section from the charge spectrometer experiment of macdonald et al .",
    "( 1972 ) for fluorine - nitrogen collisions .",
    "the dashed curve is our fit to these data , again using the nikolaev ( 1967 ) formalism but with a sum over all n@xmath511 , and the same normalizing factor of 0.1 .",
    "it is encouraging that with a single normalizing factor we could account for all of the data in figure  3 with accuracy better than a factor of 2 .",
    "in addition , the normalizing factor of 0.1 is within the range of the nikolaev semiempirical normalizations for charge exchange on fast protons .",
    "we also compared the predictions of the schiff ( 1954 ) formula with the data shown in figure  2 . while for the h target",
    ", the formula gives an acceptable fit with the same normalization of 0.1 , it predicts incorrect spectral dependencies for targets heavier than he , which is not surprising since the formula was developed for h - like targets in the ground state .",
    "the plane - wave - born - approximation ( pwba ) gives a satisfactory description for the coulomb excitation of atomic electrons ( bates 1962 ) .",
    "figure  3 shows a comparison of theoretical cross sections with the experimental data of hopkins , little , & cue ( 1976a ) for the excitation of 1@xmath47 electrons which leads to k x - ray emission .",
    "the theoretical curves consist of the sum of the 1@xmath47@xmath522@xmath46 and 1@xmath47@xmath523@xmath46 excitation cross sections , excitations to higher levels , which have much smaller cross sections , being neglected .",
    "the cross sections for the excitation of f@xmath53 are greater than twice those of f@xmath54 ( f@xmath53 has two k - shell electrons which could be excited ) , because we took into account the screening of the nuclear charge of the projectile by the other k - shell electron .",
    "although the pwba theory indicates that the excitation cross sections scale as the target charge squared , the hopkins et al .",
    "( 1976a ) measurements show that the cross sections for excitation by he are @xmath420% lower than four times the corresponding ones for excitation by h. this discrepancy was attributed to the screening effect of the helium electrons ( hopkins et al .",
    "to take this effect into account , we used a normalization factor of 0.8 for all the target elements heavier than hydrogen in addition to the scaling with the target charge squared .",
    "this approximation has only a small impact on the final result , since the contribution of the elements heavier than he to the excitation represents less than 4% of the final x - ray production .",
    "we neglected the contributions of excitation reactions in which both the projectile and the target are excited based on the results of moiseiwitsch & stewart ( 1954 ) .",
    "the o ions lose energy more slowly than they capture and lose electrons by interacting with a neutral ambient medium of solar composition ( see the discussion of bussard et al .",
    "1978 for fast fe ions ) .",
    "thus , in a steady state , the charge fractions @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the number of bound electrons of the projectile , satisfy the equation @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are , respectively , the electron capture and ionization cross sections for o ions with @xmath56 electrons interacting with an ambient medium of solar composition .",
    "ionization cross sections scale approximately as the target charge squared ( rule 1977 ) .",
    "thus , because of the low abundances of the heavier elements ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) , the fast ions lose their electrons by colliding mainly with ambient h and he .",
    "this is not the case for electron captures because of the strong dependence of the charge exchange cross section on the charge of the target nucleus ( e.g. figure  2 ) .",
    "we took into account the ambient h , he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s and fe to calculate the total electron capture of the fast o ions in the medium of solar composition . ionization cross sections of o ions in collisions with neutral h and he were taken respectively from watson ( 1976 ) and rule ( 1977 ) .",
    "the electron capture and loss cross sections for fast o in a medium of solar composition are shown in figure  4a and the @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 charge fractions determined from equation ( 4 ) are shown in figure  4b .",
    "we see that contrary to the charge exchange cross sections , the ionization cross sections have a weak energy dependence . as most of the x - ray line emission",
    "is produced near the energy at which the charge exchange and ionization cross sections are equal , and because of the weak energy dependence of the ionization cross sections , the final x - ray line production is not very sensitive to the exact magnitude of the charge exchange cross section .",
    "we found that an uncertainty of a factor of 2 in the charge exchange cross section (  4.1.1 ) leads to only a 25% uncertainty in the x - ray emissivity .",
    "the multiplicities of the h - like ( o  viii ) and he - like ( o  vii ) k@xmath3 lines produced by a fast o of initial energy @xmath63 slowing down in a medium with solar abundances due to interactions with the ambient constituent @xmath11 of abundance @xmath24/@xmath22 can be obtained from equation ( 1 ) , @xmath64 and @xmath65 here the @xmath66 are the charge fractions of the o ions ; @xmath67 is the electron capture cross section into the 2@xmath46 level , either directly or following a cascade , by an ion which already has @xmath56 electrons from the target element @xmath11 ; @xmath68 is the 1@xmath47@xmath522@xmath46 excitation cross section for an o ion having @xmath56 electrons by the target element @xmath11 .",
    "the o k@xmath48 x - ray multiplicities are obtained by replacing 2@xmath46 by 3@xmath46 in equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) .    to calculate @xmath67 and @xmath69",
    ", we first calculated the total k x - ray production as in   4.1.1 , and then used the experimental result of hopkins et al .",

    "hopkins et al .",
    "( 1974 ) measured the k x - ray production from fully stripped o of 1.9 mev / nucleon interacting with various targets .",
    "as the projectiles were initially devoid of electrons , the detected k x - ray emission could have arisen only from electron capture .",
    "they found that , independent of the target charge , about 60% of the total k",
    "x - ray production was in the k@xmath3 line and 20% in the k@xmath48 line , the remaining 20% coming from the rest of the series . combining this result with the calculation of @xmath68 and @xmath70",
    ", we eventually found that each of the two k@xmath48 lines , i.e. from the h- and he - like o , represents 1/4 of the corresponding k@xmath3 line .",
    "we have evaluated equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) and the results are given in tables 1 and 2 , where we have separated the contributions from electron captures and excitations of 1@xmath47 electrons .",
    "the multiplicities are independent of the initial o energy for @xmath63@xmath7110 mev / nucleon , because at these high values of @xmath63 the nuclei are fully stripped and the probability for capturing electrons is very small .",
    "the results of tables 1 and 2 can be compared with the multiplicities given by pravdo & boldt ( 1975 ) .",
    "although our results for the contribution of charge exchange are @xmath44 times lower than theirs , the total k@xmath3 x - ray production is only 1.8 times lower .",
    "this is because excitation is now seen to be the dominant mechanism .",
    "this result is supported by the accelerator measurement of hopkins et al .",
    "( 1976a ) , which provides a clear signature that excitation is the dominant process of k x - ray production for 1 - 3 mev / nucleon f@xmath53 and f@xmath54 projectiles in hydrogen and helium .",
    "the same conclusion was found also by bussard et al .",
    "( 1978 ) for the k@xmath3 x - ray emission from fast fe .",
    "in particular , we can see from table  2 that the excitation contribution to the o  vii line production , which was not taken into account by pravdo & boldt ( 1975 ) , represents 60% of the total multiplicity .    using equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) we can also evaluate the differential multiplicities @xmath72 and @xmath73 , i.e. the number of photons produced by the projectile , due to interactions with all the constituents of the ambient medium , as it slows down over the differential energy interval @xmath74 . the results for o are shown in table  3 and figure  5c .",
    "similar multiplicities for c , n , ne , mg , si , s and fe are also shown in tables  3 and 4 and in figures  5 and 6 .",
    "these multiplicities are discussed below .",
    "we see that for o the differential multiplicities peak around 1 mev / nucleon and fall off rapidly at both lower and higher energies .",
    "the differential multiplicities for o can be compared with the results of pravdo & boldt ( 1975 ) .",
    "the positions of the peaks are consistent although , as already discussed , the magnitudes of the multiplicities are lower .",
    "the major x - ray lines from the fast ions are given in table 5 .",

    "the accelerated particle spectrum becomes softer ( i.e. with decreasing @xmath28 ) is due to the decrease of the gamma - ray production relative to the x - ray production , which occurs at much lower energies than the gamma - ray production .",

    "we note that the extragalactic x - ray background accounts for only 1/6 of the observed count rates in both figures  12a and 12b .",
    "we see in figure  12a that except for the very low @xmath28 , the calculated count rates are lower than the observed rate , suggesting a contribution of other sources , for example t tauri stars . on the other hand , we see in figure  12b that the predicted x - ray counterpart of the observed nuclear gamma - ray line emission from the 9 degree@xmath101 hot spot exceeds the rosat count rate except at the highest allowed values of @xmath28 near 100 mev / nucleon .",
    "this discrepancy could be mitigated by assuming that the area of the gamma - ray hot spot is larger than 9 degree@xmath101 , although for a smaller area a more severe discrepancy would ensue .",
    "the discrepancy could be resolved if the x - rays and gamma rays are produced by accelerated particles interacting in a partially ionized medium , for example at cloud boundaries ( bykov & bloemen 1994 ; ramaty et al .",
    "1997a , b ; kozlovsky et al .",
    "1997 ; parizot et al .",
    "1997a ) , or in a time - dependent model in which the spectrum of the accelerated particles has become quite flat because of energy losses .",
    "we elaborate on these two effects in the next two subsections .",
    "we consider the effects of a partially ionized ambient medium on the k x - ray production in the rosat r45 energy band ( 0.47 to 1.2 kev ) . in this energy range ,",
    "the k x - rays are produced by fast c , n , o and ne .",
    "as the nature of the cosmic ray ionization at the cloud boundaries is not well understood , we assume for simplicity that the ambient h and he are fully ionized but that the heavier ambient elements remain essentially neutral . thus the fast ions capture electrons from ambient c and heavier atoms only . as the capture cross sections increase rapidly toward lower energies",
    "while the electron loss cross sections are essentially constant ( figure  4a ) , the charge state distribution of the fast ions in an ionized medium is quite similar to that in a neutral medium ( figure  4b ) , except that it is established at lower values of @xmath12 .",
    "consequently , k x - rays are also produced at lower energies ( about 0.1 - 1 mev / nucleon for the c , n , o and ne k x - rays ) in an ionized medium than in a neutral medium .",
    "although the fast ions do not capture electrons from ambient h and he , the rate of electron capture is not very different from that in a neutral medium because of the more efficient electron capture from heavier ambient atoms caused by the increase of the capture cross sections toward lower energies ( figure  4a ) .",
    "we also do not expect substantial reductions of the magnitude of the k x - ray multiplicities due to excitation , because the excitations are mainly due to the ambient nuclei and the cross sections are only slowly decreasing at lower energies ( figure  3 ) .    the main difference between k x - ray production from fast ions interacting in an ionized or a neutral medium is due to the energy losses .",
    "it is well - known that fast ions lose more energy in a plasma than in a neutral medium , because the collective long - range coulomb interactions are more efficient than ionization . both the x - ray and gamma - ray production rates",
    "are reduced , but as we shall see , the effect is stronger for the x - rays .",
    "the energy loss rate depends on the effective charge of the fast ion .",
    "we calculated the effective charge of a fast o in a medium of solar composition in which h and he are fully ionized and the result is shown by the dashed curve in figure  13a .",
    "we found that this effective charge could be approximated by a formula similar to that used to describe the effective charge in a neutral medium (  2 ) , @xmath103 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with a modified exponential to take into account the increase of the fast ion charge in the ionized medium .",
    "we then calculated the o ion energy loss in a plasma using equations ( 4.21 ) and ( 4.22 ) from mannheim and schlickeiser ( 1994 ) , in which we substituted the nuclear charge of the projectile by its effective charge [ eq .",
    "we assumed a typical temperature of 10@xmath104 k at cloud boundaries .",
    "the energy loss is not very sensitive to temperature for @xmath105 mev / nucleon . in figure  13b",
    "we show the ratio of the energy loss in an ionized medium to that in a neutral medium for fast o ions .",
    "we see that while at high energies the increase in the energy loss rate is about a factor of 2 , below an mev / nucleon the energy loss rate in an ionized medium exceeds that in a neutral medium by more than a factor of 6 .",
    "this result is supported by the laboratory measurements of hoffmann et al .",
    "( 1994 ) for the energy loss of various fast ions in a hydrogen plasma .    because the x - ray line emission is produced between about 0.1 and 1 mev / nucleon , while the 3 - 7 mev gamma - ray line production occurs essentially above 10 mev / nucleon ( ramaty et al .",
    "1996 ) , the ratio of thick target [ eq .",
    "( 1 ) ] x - ray to gamma - ray line production in an ionized medium will be lower than in a neutral medium , by about a factor of 3 .",
    "we emphasize that this decrease is mainly due to the increase in the fast ion energy loss rate rather than the changes in the electron capture , ionization and excitation .",
    "because the k x - ray production in the rosat r45 energy band ( 0.47 to 1.2 kev ) is due to very low energy ions , time - dependent effects could significantly reduce the number of such ions relative to that of the higher energy gamma - ray line producing ions , thereby decreasing the x - ray production rate relative to the gamma - ray production rate .    to illustrate the effect",
    ", we first calculate the differential equilibrium particle number @xmath106 for steady state , thick target interactions .",
    "this is given by ( see eq .",
    "1 ) @xmath107 where the energy loss rate in a neutral medium is @xmath108 the dashed curve in figure  14 shows this @xmath106 for o ions with @xmath28=30 mev / nucleon , normalized such that the instantaneous energy deposition rate , @xmath109 , is 10@xmath110 erg / s for an average ambient hydrogen density of 10 @xmath111 .",
    "this is the approximate energy deposition rate that accompanies the gamma - ray production rate in orion due to o ions ( ramaty et al .",
    "while the energy deposition rate can be calculated independent of the ambient density , the equilibrium number does depend on the density which is quite uncertain .",
    "the value of 10 @xmath111 is not unreasonable if the accelerated particles spend part of their life time in the clouds .",
    "next we assume that the accelerated particles are injected as a delta function in time ( i.e. over a time interval which is very short compared to the life time against energy losses ) . the time - dependent differential particle number is then given by ( e.g. parizot et al .",
    "1997b ) @xmath112 here @xmath113^{-1 } de''\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the elapsed time since the injection of the particles and the energy loss rates in equation ( 12 ) are derived at @xmath114 and @xmath33 .",
    "we normalize the injection source @xmath115 such that the total energy deposited at @xmath116=0 in the time - dependent case equals the deposited steady state energy over a time period of 10@xmath8 years .",
    "this leads to a total deposited energy in o nuclei of 3.2@xmath510@xmath117 ergs .",
    "this value , together with the contributions of the other accelerated nuclei , yields a total accelerated particle energy content of about 10@xmath118 ergs ( depending on the assumed composition ) , which could have been supplied by the supernova that is thought to have occurred about 80,000 years ago and reheated the orion - eridanus bubble ( burrows et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the results are shown by the solid curves in figure  14 for the same ambient density and @xmath28 as used for the steady state result .",
    "we see that , as time progresses , the differential number densities at low energies are suppressed relative to those at higher energies . since in a neutral medium the k x - ray line emission from o",
    "is typically produced around 1 mev / nucleon while the gamma rays are produced above 10 mev / nucleon , we expect a significant reduction of the x - ray line to gamma - ray line production ratio relative to the corresponding production ratio for the steady state case . at t=3@xmath510@xmath6 years , for example",
    ", the reduction is about an order of magnitude .",
    "we have investigated all the processes that lead to x - ray production by low energy cosmic rays for a variety of accelerated particle compositions and energy spectra .",
    "we demonstrated that the dominant continuum producing process is inverse bremsstrahlung produced by fast ions interacting with ambient electrons . in addition , there is also a significant contribution from the bremsstrahlung produced by secondary knock - on electrons .",
    "however , below a few kev the total x - ray emission produced by accelerated ions is dominated by relatively broad line emission ( line widths @xmath119@xmath1200.1 ) resulting from de - excitations in the fast ions following electron captures and excitations .",
    "in addition , accelerated particle interactions also produce much narrower x - ray lines , due to inner - shell vacancy creation .",
    "the most prominent of such line is that at 6.4 kev from ambient fe .",
    "we have calculated the x - ray line and continuum emission produced by the accelerated particles in orion which are thought to be responsible for the nuclear gamma - ray line emission observed with comptel ( bloemen et al .",
    "1994 , 1997 ) .",
    "by first comparing the results with the extragalactic diffuse x - ray background , we found that while the continuum is generally below this background , the line emission from about 0.5 to 1.5 kev exceeds the background for all the combination of parameters that we considered .",
    "we wish to point out that there could be a significant contribution to the @xmath40.5 - 1.5 kev diffuse x - ray background from as - yet unknown sources within our galaxy ( e.g. park et al .",
    "1997 ) , leaving the possibility that a substantial fraction of the observed x - ray intensity in this energy range results from low energy cosmic ray interactions .",
    "we have also compared our results with rosat observations of orion in the 0.47 to 1.2 kev energy band , again normalizing the x - ray emission to the observed gamma - ray emission .",
    "we found that there is no conflict between the predicted total x - ray emission ( lines and continuum ) and the data for a broad range of parameters if the gamma - ray line emission is uniformly distributed over the entire molecular cloud complex .",
    "this conclusion differs from our previous one ( ramaty et al .",
    "1997a ) because of a lower predicted x - ray line emission , resulting from improved atomic physics input , and because our estimated rosat flux from orion is higher than the upper limit given by dogiel et al .",
    "however , the comptel data show significant spatial structure .",
    "we found that for the most prominent hot spot in the comptel map , the standard thick target , steady state interaction model , with a neutral ambient medium , predicts x - ray fluxes which exceed the rosat data for a broad range of parameters .",
    "but the calculations could be consistent with the data for any one , or a combination of the following possibilities : a very hard accelerated particle spectrum ; a partially ionized ambient medium ; and a time - dependent accelerated particle energy spectrum resulting from essentially instantaneous acceleration some tens of thousand of years ago .",
    "there are as - yet no astrophysical x - ray observations that would unambiguously indicate an origin resulting from low energy , accelerated ion interactions .",
