    "the operation of the 7- and 8-tev runs of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) has provided us with quite important information about electroweak symmetry breaking ; namely , the discovery of a standard model ( sm)-like higgs boson  @xcite with a mass of about 126 gev .",
    "this fact becomes a strong guidance for us to consider various models beyond the sm .",
    "moreover , null results of any other new particles so far impose lower bounds on their masses and/or new physics scales .",
    "it is of great interest to discuss what kind of signals from new physics can be expected at the upcoming 13-and 14-tev runs , while taking into account the data collected in the 8-tev run .    an extra @xmath9 gauge symmetry is often introduced based on various motivations in physics beyond the sm , resulting in an additional massive neutral gauge boson usually called the @xmath0 boson .",
    "for example , there are usually additional @xmath9 gauge symmetries in grand unified theories ( gut s ) such as the @xmath1 model  @xcite .",
    "besides , the discrete @xmath10 symmetry required for stabilizing dark matter candidates can naturally emerge from a local @xmath9 gauge group  @xcite .",
    "an extra @xmath9 has also been employed in supersymmetric models  @xcite ( so - called umssm ) to facilitate a strong first order electroweak phase transition , as required to realize successful electroweak baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "properties of such @xmath0 bosons strongly depend on the origin of the corresponding @xmath9 symmetry in models . therefore , phenomenological studies of @xmath0 bosons are essential to distinguish such new physics models  @xcite",
    ".    searches for @xmath0 bosons have been performed mainly using the dilepton events at the lhc .",
    "if the couplings of the @xmath0 boson with fermions are the same as those of the @xmath11 boson ( the so - called sequential @xmath0 case ) , the lower mass limit has been found to be 2.86 tev ( 1.90 tev ) at the 95% confidence level ( cl ) from collisions at 8 tev with an integrated luminosity of 19.5 fb@xmath4 by using @xmath12 and @xmath13  @xcite ( @xmath14  @xcite ) events .    however , such searches become ineffective when the @xmath0 boson does not couple to the leptons . in this paper , we focus on the study of leptophobic @xmath0 bosons derived from different scenarios of the @xmath1 gut .    in the @xmath1 model",
    "@xcite , there is a kinetic mixing between the hypercharge @xmath15 group and the extra @xmath9 s after gut breaking . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath0 charge of each fermion is a linear combination of these @xmath9 charges , involving two free parameters .",
    "they can be chosen so that the @xmath0 charges for the left - handed and right - handed charged leptons are zero , rendering the leptophobia nature .",
    "phenomenological studies of the leptophobic @xmath0 boson had been done in refs .",
    "@xcite , with collider signals for the @xmath0 searched for at the tevatron  @xcite and the lhc  @xcite .",
    "lhc collider signatures of a leptophobic @xmath0 boson that couples to a dark matter candidate had been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , a leptophobic @xmath0 boson with the mass of about 150 gev was proposed to explain the excess in the @xmath6 events observed by the tevatron cdf collaboration .",
    "effects of the leptophobic @xmath0 to the @xmath16 process due to the @xmath11-@xmath0 mixing had been analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss all possible scenarios with a leptophobic @xmath0 boson in the @xmath1 gut model , differing in particle embeddings  @xcite .",
    "first , we consider the bound on the @xmath0 mass according to current data of collider experiments . in most scenarios ,",
    "the @xmath0 can be excluded up to about @xmath17(1 ) tev by the @xmath18 data at the lhc .",
    "however , this method does not apply when the @xmath0 mass is below the threshold for decaying into a pair of top quarks .",
    "we also take into account dijet data at the lhc and at the ua2 , deriving respectively a lower bound of about 500 gev and 250 gev on the @xmath0 mass only in one of the scenarios .",
    "in addition , although the @xmath6 and @xmath7 processes have been measured at the lhc , no bound can be obtained currently because of a small @xmath0 contribution to the cross sections compared to the experimental error bar .",
    "therefore , we propose a promising channel , the photon associated production of @xmath0 , at the lhc to search for the leptophobic @xmath0 boson with a mass smaller than @xmath19 .",
    "we further focus on the bottom quark pair decay mode of @xmath0 , @xmath20 , for the advantage of using double b - tagging to reduce the background events . with a detailed simulation of signal and background events ,",
    "we obtain the result of signal significance as a function of the @xmath0 mass .",
    "in addition , we further estimate the integrated luminosity required for a 5-sigma discovery for the 14-tev lhc .    the structure of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we review the interaction lagrangian for the leptophobic @xmath0 boson in section  [ sec : model ] , where the decay and production of the @xmath0 are also discussed .",
    "the current bounds on the @xmath0 mass from various experiments are reviewed in section  [ sec : bounds ] . in section",
    "[ sec : simulation ] , we propose to use the @xmath8 process to search for a light @xmath0 boson .",
    "a detailed simulation is presented to show what constraints we could have using the current data and the prospect of detecting such a particle at the 14-tev lhc .",
    "our findings are summarized in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "a brief review of the different leptophobic scenarios in the @xmath1 model is given in the appendix .",
    "the interactions of the leptophobic @xmath0 boson with sm quarks are given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 represent the up- and down - type quarks , respectively .",

    "we note here that the value of the gauge coupling constant @xmath29 at the tev scale can be predicted according to renormalization group running from the gut scale , which depends on the details of matter contents and unification scale . as in ref .",

    "we note that in the calculations of total width and branching fractions , the @xmath0 boson is assumed to decay into only sm quarks .",
