    "thermal fluctuations constantly deform the dna molecular bonds crumpling the helix into a random coil configuration whose end - to - end distance ( @xmath1 ) is much shorter than the overall contour length ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "accordingly , thermal bending fluctuations are key to the dna biological functioning as they bring together enhancers ( regulatory dna sequences to which activator proteins bind ) _ and _ gene promoter regions ( stretches of genome where dna transcription factors bind ) that could be even thousands of nucleotide pairs away along the molecule axis .",

    "have been quantitatively analyzed following the development of micro - manipulation techniques and force transducers in the pico - newton regime @xcite .",
    "forces in such range permit to straighten bends and kinks in the helix due to the buffeting of the thermal bath .",
    "in fact , at the nano - scale , the room temperature thermal energy per nano - meter is , @xmath3 .    in general",
    ", the strength of the applied force sets the length scale in the single molecule elastic response with larger forces sampling shorter scales , down to the covalent bond distance between adjacent nucleotides along the strands @xcite .",
    "groundbreaking experiments on @xmath4-phage dna @xcite have revealed a force versus extension pattern with distinct regimes . in the limit of weak applied forces ,",
    "the chain extension is lower than @xmath2 and dna behaves as a linear spring whose force constant is inversely proportional both to the persistence length ( @xmath5 ) and to @xmath2 . by increasing the force in the intermediate regime ,",
    "more work is done against the random fluctuations of the thermal bath and the dna behavior becomes progressively non - linear .",
    "for larger forces , @xmath1 gets of order of @xmath2 , chemical changes intervene in the molecule backbone and the chain elastic response should include the enthalpic compliance through a finite stretch modulus . at @xmath6 the molecule elongates abruptly from a length of @xmath7 to @xmath8 in a very narrow force range displaying a plateau in the force - extension relation which is the peculiar feature of a cooperative over - stretching transition .",
    "importantly , the latter is observed at @xmath6 if the experimental set - up allows the @xmath4-phage molecule to untwist while being stretched . on the other hand ,",
    "once both ends of the two complementary strands are anchored such as the molecule is torsionally constrained @xcite , the sudden elongation is shifted at higher forces , namely it shows up above @xmath9 @xcite . while it is still debated whether the mechanically over - stretched @xmath4-molecules transform into a structurally different s - dna or simply melt in two separate strands @xcite , it is recognized that in the small and intermediate regime , up to applied forces of @xmath10 , the extension data are well described by worm - like - chain ( wlc ) elastic models @xcite .",
    "importantly , it is pointed out that @xmath4-molecules are sufficiently long , @xmath11 , to fulfill the key assumption for the application of the wlc approach that is , @xmath12 , with @xmath5 being typically of @xmath13 in dna although intrinsic values of @xmath14 have also been reported @xcite .",
    "instead , for short fragments with @xmath2 in the range of only a few tens of base pairs ( _ bps _ ) , recent advances in experimental methods have permitted to characterize physical properties which challenge the view of the wlc model .",
    "dna cyclization measurements using both the ligase protein assays @xcite and , more recently , single - molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( fret ) assay @xcite have delivered @xmath15- factors which are several orders of magnitude larger than predicted by the conventional wlc model @xcite .",
    "small - angle x - ray scattering ( saxs ) measurements of mean and variance of @xmath1 have been explained in terms of soft stretching modes which cooperatively involve _ bps _ over two helix turns @xcite .",
    "these results have been corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations which find a softening by almost one order of magnitude in the stretching modulus of a 56-mer mainly ascribed to end effects @xcite .",
    "also combined fret measurements of @xmath1 and saxs measurements of the radius of gyration for a set of sequences with @xmath16 _ bps _ @xcite point to a remarkable chain flexibility , possibly due to the occurrence of single base pair breaking , and are consistent with a substantially lower @xmath5 than the typical value .    while extensions of the wlc model have also been proposed to interpret the controversial results of all these measurements @xcite , there is growing consensus that short dna fragments may indeed display large bending fluctuations and persistence lengths which are significantly smaller than those traditionally estimated for long molecules .",
    "thus , the overall picture emerging from a body of experimental and theoretical work is that the dna elastic properties vary with the molecule size and that an intrinsic flexibility emerges at those length scales relevant to biological processes such as regulation of protein binding and formation of nucleosomes whose basic unit is indeed a fragment of @xmath17 _",
    "bps_.    certainly a comprehension of the dna phenomenology at such short scales requires a characterization of the model based on the intermolecular forces which are instead coarse grained in the standard wlc approach .",
    "this in fact considers the dna molecule as a flexible chain , inextensible along its contour , whereby the orientational correlation function between distant segments decays exponentially over the characteristic @xmath18 which amounts to a length of @xmath19 _ bps _ along the stack .",
    "here we propose a method that treats the dna molecule at the level of the base pair and calculates the chain bending deformations by a mesoscopic hamiltonian which includes the hydrogen bonds between complementary strands and the stacking interactions along the molecule backbone .",
    "the latter bear dependence on both the helix twisting and the bending angles between adjacent _",
    "bps_. performing ensemble averages over equilibrium distributions of base pair fluctuations we obtain quantitative estimates for experimentally accessible quantities such as @xmath1 and @xmath5 for a set of dna molecules in terms of the input parameters of the mesoscopic potential . while method and model are general and can be applied to any heterogeneous sequence , we focus here on a set of homogeneous chains highlighting the effects of their length .",
    "the model contains a tunable external force which perturbs the molecule by coupling to the specific sites along the stack . assuming a initial fully stretched configuration , @xmath20 , we introduce a small force which induces the elastic response of the molecule dominated by random bending due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "accordingly @xmath1 gets smaller than @xmath2 in the weak force regime .",
    "this occurs as long as the applied force becomes sufficiently strong to overcome the contraction due to the intrinsic entropic term . at this stage",
    "the molecule begins to stretch , @xmath1 grows as a function of the external force and eventually tends to the contour length value .",
    "it is shown that the length of the chain critically affects the response to the external field hence , the transition between entropic regime and intermediate force regime in which the molecule stretches .",
    "thus , simulating various force profiles acting at the base pair level , we establish quantitative relations between applied strengths and molecule macroscopic properties as a function of the chain length . in this context , the reduced @xmath5 values found for short molecules are interpreted as a consequence of the contractile forces and are consistent with the presence of large bending fluctuations between adjacent _ bps_. the results of our discrete method are compared with the predictions of the wlc model while a non strict comparison is given with the experimental data available for a short sequence in the range of those here considered .",
    "the large forces regime in which rise distance and dna structure are altered is not investigated in this work .    in section",
    "ii , we describe the geometrical model for the dna molecule whose axis is subject to the action of the intrinsic contractile force and of the applied forces .",
    "the mesoscopic hamiltonian is proposed in section iii while the method to compute the average bending angles between the base pair planes is explained in section iv .",
    "the general relations between end - to - end distance and persistence length are reported in section v. the obtained results are discussed in section vi and some final remarks are made in section vii .",
    "the basic representation for a double stranded chain is based on a ladder model as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig:1](a ) .",
    "the two mates of the @xmath21 base pair can fluctuate around their equilibrium positions represented by the green dots lying along the two complementary strands .",
    "the vibrations of the two bases along the stack are much smaller than the transverse vibrations @xmath22 , i.e. the model is at this stage one - dimensional . @xmath23 and @xmath24 may be in - phase ( as depicted ) or out - of - phase . in general ,",
    "also their amplitudes may differ .",
    "@xmath25 is the average helix diameter and @xmath26 is the average rise distance .",
    "with respect to the central helical axis ( that is kept fixed ) , we build the vectors @xmath27 and @xmath28 and define the relative distance @xmath29 .",

[ fig:1](b ) , which is an integration variable of our model . in general , the @xmath30 s are not constrained to the sheet plane : adjacent @xmath32 and @xmath30 along the stack are in fact twisted by an angle @xmath34 ( not drawn ) lying on a plane normal to the sheet @xcite . for the @xmath21 base pair ,",
    "the torsional angle is given by , @xmath35 , with @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the helical repeat , i.e. , the number of _ bps _ per helix turn .",
    "the standard value measured for instance in covalently closed dna in solution is @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "more generally , one may release the torsional constraint and consider @xmath37 as a variable to be determined by free energy minimization @xcite for any value of the applied force .",

    "is included in the partition function to allow for a distribution of possible _ bps _ orientations .",
    "thus our model is essentially made by @xmath40 segments connecting the @xmath41 s which are arranged as beads along the central helical axis . for any @xmath41 , there is a base pair distance @xmath30 which independently fluctuates on the plane ( normal to the sheet ) containing the average helix diameter , drawn by the ( red ) long - dashed line in fig .",

    "this property ensures that , once the short fragments form a loop , the writhe of that circular molecule is zero @xcite . accordingly",
    "the model can be extended to study also the @xmath15- factors of short fragments by imposing suitable boundary conditions .",
    "while the cyclization probabilities are expected to decrease by shortening the molecule length , the entropic forces may substantially bend even short linear chains . as represented in fig .",

    "@xmath18 quickly drops but remains much larger than @xmath5 .",

    "altogether , we conclude that the use of eq .",

    "also the persistence length derived from the measured radius of gyration , @xmath170 , for a @xmath171 chain @xcite , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5](b ) ( red dashed line ) . in order to fit @xmath172 , we use the wlc relation @xcite , @xmath173 with @xmath174 and @xmath175 denotes the value obtained from the experimental @xmath172 .",
    "precisely , @xmath172 is corrected by involving the finite dna diameter @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath176 .",
    "taking @xmath177 as above , we get @xmath178 which is lower than the length ( @xmath179 ) obtained in ref.@xcite from the experimental @xmath172 of ref.@xcite .",
    "it is however found that @xmath175 is very sensitive to the input parameters used in the fitting . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath175 remains well above the range of values predicted for the @xmath159 chain in fig .",
    "[ fig:5](a ) by the discrete model .",
    "this confirms quantitatively that the latter leads to more conservative estimates of the persistence length than those made using the wlc model .",
    "it is also noticed that @xmath175 is much larger than @xmath2 and this questions the applicability of the wlc formula @xcite to force - extension experiments in short chains .",
    "the dashed line intersects the plots derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) at distinct force values in the weak regime for the three profiles .",

    "[ fig:3](b ) for the profile @xmath45 .",
    "the trend , albeit more pronounced , is found for the profile @xmath46 and mostly for a uniform @xmath44 as shown , for @xmath154 in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] where the normalized end - to - end distances and persistence lengths are drawn .",
    "also the plots for the @xmath182 chain with uniform @xmath44 are reported .",
    "the force - extension behavior with @xmath1 growing as a function of the applied force , is recovered from @xmath183 ( @xmath154 ) and @xmath184 ( @xmath182 ) upwards .",
    "it is thus expected that for longer chains ( in the kilo-_bps _ range ) than those considered here , the usual mechanical response of the entropic elastic regime begins at weaker stretching perturbations and also @xmath44 of order @xmath185 or lower can produce some extension of the molecule .",
    "eventually , noticing that the persistence length defined by the discrete model varies with the applied force , the question arises as to weather such quantity can provide a realistic measure of the overall stiffness of the chain . on the base of the presented calculations , we propose that a stiffness indicator can be extracted from the minimum values in the @xmath5 s plots , marked in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] for two chains .",
    "in fact , the minima correspond to the most bent chains configuration under the contractile effect of the entropic forces , as visualized in the upper panel .",
    "we have studied the flexibility of short chains with @xmath42 base pairs by computing the average bending angles between adjacent base pairs along the molecule backbone .",
    "the calculation is based on a mesoscopic hamiltonian that models both the inter - strand forces with hydrogen bonds between the base pair mates and the intra - strand forces between stacked base pairs , also depending on the rotational degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , experimentally accessible quantities such as end - to - end distance and persistence length are related to the effective parameters of the potential in a discrete model which treats the chain at the level of the base pair , it includes the effects of the solvent and allows for kinks formation due to large bending fluctuations between neighbor base pairs along the stack .",
    "while the proposed approach is general enough to be applied to any heterogeneous sequence in solution , we have considered in this paper a set of short homogeneous fragments to focus on the interplay between chain bendability and its length .",
    "the ensemble averages for the bending angles are performed by an integration over a large distribution of base pair configurations which guarantees the thermodynamic equilibrium of the system and accounts for the thermal fluctuations of the base pair separations .",
    "this feature also permits to investigate the chain flexibility as a function of temperature , a subject which is left for a future work .",
    "here we have studied , at room temperature , the chain elastic response to an applied mechanical stretching represented both by forces whose intensity varies along the chain and by a constant force field as usually taken in force - extension analysis .",
    "importantly , the study has been limited to a regime of weak and intermediate forces on the pico - newton scale consistent with the assumption that rise distance and structure of the molecule are not deformed . moreover",
    ", our calculation applies to torsionally constrained chains as the helical repeat of the molecule , i.e. the twist angle , is taken as constant .",
    "this constraint may be removed in a separate study by determining , for any applied force , the specific twist conformation which minimizes the free energy of the chain , albeit at the expense of a much longer computational time .    assuming that in the absence of external forces the short molecule is stretched , i.e.",
    ", the end - to - end distance is equal to the contour length , we have shown that under the action of a weak perturbation the chain response is dominated by thermal bending fluctuations which contract @xmath1 down to a minimum value . by enhancing the applied force over a certain threshold ,",
    "the bonds along the molecule backbone are progressively straightened and @xmath1 grows as a function of the force .",
    "interestingly , the value of the threshold depends on the type of applied force and , for a specific profile e.g. , @xmath45 in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](a ) or a uniform force in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] , the threshold shifts upwards by decreasing the chain length .",
    "this is physically understood by observing that , once the molecules are in the entropically favored bent conformation , larger forces are required to align the bonds of shorter chains which are intrinsically stiffer .",
    "this interpretation may seem at variance with the displayed persistence lengths which are indeed higher for longer chains .",
    "however , the apparent contradiction is solved upon noticing that the calculated @xmath5 s are averaged over the site dependent persistence lengths of our discrete model and , for the stretched configuration without applied forces , are proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "once the @xmath5 s are normalized over the contour length @xmath2 , the trend is in fact reversed and the ratios @xmath186 of the bent conformations are higher for shorter chains ( see inset in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](b ) ) confirming that the latter have an enhanced stiffness _ per base",
    "pair_. notwithstanding , the predicted @xmath5 s are significantly smaller than those estimated for long dna molecules through the worm - like - chain model and even smaller than the value experimentally obtained for a short chain with comparable number of base pairs . in this",
    "regard we have discussed the possible sources of these discrepancies and pointed out that the wlc formulas , relating the persistence length to the end - to - end distance and to the radius of gyration respectively , yield overestimated values with respect to the discrete model .",
    "the fact remains that several ways to estimate the persistence length appear in the literature and this contributes to contrasting outcomes .",
    "altogether our results are in line with a body of recent studies which have emphasized the remarkable flexibility of dna on short length scales although more extensive simulations and stricter comparisons with experiments on the same fragments are necessary to elucidate these questions ."
