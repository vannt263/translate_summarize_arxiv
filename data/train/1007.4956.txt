    "having served @xmath7 fixed - target experiments including e760 and e835 , it is now solely dedicated to the tevatron collider , but could once again support dedicated antiproton experiments after completion of the tevatron program , currently planned for  2011 ( although 2014 is a possibility under discussion ) .    [",
    "tab : sens - comp ]  @xmath8 the lower number of operating hours at fair arises from medium - energy antiproton operation having to share time with other programs .",
    "a very capable and cost - effective experiment can be mounted by adding a magnetic spectrometer to the e760 lead - glass calorimeter,@xcite using an available bess solenoid@xcite ,  fine - pitch scintillating fibers ( scifi ) , the d  scifi readout system,@xcite and hadron i d via fast timing.@xcite this could produce world - leading measurements of charm mixing and the other effects mentioned above , provided the relevant cross sections are of the expected magnitude .",
    "after a @xmath1020-year search , @xmath0 mixing is now established  at @xmath1010@xmath11.@xcite while the @xmath121% mixing rate may indicate a standard - model origin ,  @xcite a significant  new - physics contribution ( signaled by cpv ) is not ruled out  @xcite . since new physics can produce differing effects in the up- and down - type quark sectors ,  @xcite  such  studies are important not only with @xmath13 and @xmath14 hadrons , but also with charm  the only up - type meson that can mix .",

    "the low charged - particle multiplicity  ( @xmath30 ) at this energy may allow clean samples with the application of only modest vertex cuts , hence high efficiency .",
    "medium - energy @xmath18 interactions may thus be the optimal way to search for charm cpv .",
    "preliminary simulation and background studies imply a @xmath31 signal - to - background ratio of @xmath1610-to-1 before vertex cuts . with 150@xmath17 m resolution in  @xmath29",

    "since the @xmath40 threshold lies in the same region as the open - charm threshold , the proposed  experiment  can test these observations using @xmath41 decays and potential @xmath42 cpv ( signaled by small @xmath43@xmath44 decay - width differences in @xmath45 or @xmath46 final states@xcite ) .",

    "the above may be an under- or an overestimate , perhaps by as much as an order of magnitude .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that a new experiment at the antiproton accumulator could obtain the world s largest clean samples of @xmath70 , in perhaps as little as a month of running .",
    "the high statistics , event cleanliness , and unique precision available in the @xmath7 formation technique could enable the world s smallest systematics . such an experiment could thus provide a definitive test of the nature of the @xmath70 .",
    "production of antihydrogen in flight@xcite  may offer a way around some of the difficulties encountered in the cern trapping experiments .",
    "methods to measure the antihydrogen lamb shift and fine structure have been proposed.@xcite progress towards this goal may be compatible with normal tevatron collider operations ( a possibility currently under investigation ) , and the program could continue into the post - tevatron era .",
    "while general relativity predicts identical gravitational forces on matter and antimatter ,  a direct experimental test has yet to be made.@xcite quantum  gravity can include non - tensor forces that cancel for matter - matter interactions but add for matter - antimatter ones .",
    "possible fifth forces ,  non-@xmath73 dependence , and lorentz violation have also been discussed.@xcite the acceleration of antimatter ( @xmath74 ) in the earth s gravitational field is sensitive to these effects . such a measurement for antihydrogen ( @xmath75 ) has only recently become feasible and is now approved at the ad@xcite and proposed at fermilab.@xcite the fermilab proposal@xcite seeks to form a  slow ( @xmath121km / s ) @xmath75 beam in a penning trap and pass it through an atom interferometer , using either material gratings ( giving @xmath76 ) or  laser techniques@xcite ( @xmath77@xmath78 ) .",
    "high @xmath2 flux  means that even an inefficient ( @xmath1610@xmath79 ) deceleration approach gives enough antiprotons for competitive measurements .",
    "deceleration ideas start with the main injector , probably useable down to @xmath12400mev , followed by  an ` antiproton refrigerator,'@xcite reverse linac , or  small synchrotron.@xcite",
