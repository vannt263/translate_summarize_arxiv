    "hadronization is the process through which partons , created in an elementary interaction , turn into the hadrons .",
    "experimentally the hadronization process in free space ( vacuum ) has been studied extensively in @xmath7 annihilation and in semi - inclusive lepton - proton deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) . as a result , the spectra of hadrons produced and their kinematical dependences are rather well known . however",
    ", little is known about the space - time evolution of the process , because the products of this process can only be observed in a detector that is separated from the reaction point by a macroscopic distance .",
    "it is worth to mention that according to theoretical estimates the hadronization process occurs over length scales that vary from less than a femtometer to several tens of femtometers .",
    "the nuclear medium can serve as a detector located directly at the place where microscopic interaction happens .",
    "consequently , leptoproduction of hadrons on atomic nuclei provides a way to investigate the space - time picture of the hadronization process .",
    "the semi - inclusive dis of leptons on nuclear targets is widely used for the study of this process  @xcite .",
    "it is most effective to observe at moderate energies of the virtual photon , when the formation time of the hadron is comparable with the nuclear radius .",
    "such possibility provides hermes experiment at desy , which uses electron ( positron ) beam with energy @xmath8 and fixed nuclear targets .",
    "+ the most convenient observable measured experimentally for this process is the nuclear attenuation ratio , which is a ratio of multiplicities on nucleus and deuterium ( per nucleon ) for a given hadron",
    ". we shall denote it as @xmath2 . for a more profound understanding of the hadronization mechanism , it is important to find a variable which allows to present this observable in the most simple functional form . +",
    "usually it is supposed , that @xmath2 is a function of two variables @xmath1 and @xmath0 , which are the energy of photon and the fraction of this energy carried by the final hadron with energy @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , respectively also depends on the photon virtuality @xmath11 and on the square of the hadron transverse momentum in respect to the virtual photon direction , @xmath12 .",
    "however , from the experimental data , it is known that @xmath2 is a much sensitive function of @xmath1 and @xmath0 in comparison with @xmath11 and @xmath12 . ] .",
    "+ in our preceding work  @xcite we performed a fit for the evidence that the formation time @xmath3 is the best variable for @xmath2 , i.e. that it can be parametrized as a function of a single variable @xmath3 .",
    "three widely known representations for @xmath3 were used for the fit . the experimental data for pions on nitrogen and for identified hadrons on krypton nuclei obtained by the hermes experiment  @xcite were used for this fit .",
    "we have demonstrated that the nuclear attenuation ratio can be presented , with good precision , as a function of a single variable @xmath3 instead of a function of two variables @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , @xmath2 is a linear function of @xmath3 .",
    "we named @xmath3 a scaling variable , because it contains all @xmath1 and @xmath0 dependencies of @xmath2 .",
    "for the fit we have obtained @xmath2 as a function of @xmath3 from experimental data  @xcite , where it was measured as a function of @xmath1 with the integration over @xmath0 , and as a function of @xmath0 with the integration over @xmath1 .",
    "this means , that the data were taken at an unequal binning over @xmath1 and @xmath0 . in case of @xmath1-dependence",
    "the detailed bins over the variable @xmath1 were taken , and for each value of @xmath1 the value of @xmath0 averaged over whole range of measured @xmath0 ( @xmath13 ) was taken . in case of @xmath0-dependence",
    "we also performed the above mentioned procedure .",
    "+ recent work of published by the hermes experiment  @xcite allows to escape this difficulty , because the data published contains , among others , the so called two - dimensional data , i.e. multiplicity ratio @xmath2 for charged pions produced in a @xmath0 slices as a function of @xmath1 , and in a @xmath1 slices as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the data were obtained for four nuclear targets and used for a new fit of @xmath2 as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "+ the main aim of this work is to show , that @xmath2 is a function of single variable @xmath3 , rather than a function of two variables @xmath1 and @xmath0 , using the new set of @xmath2 given by the two - dimensional analysis , where the data is split into more regular @xmath1 and @xmath0 bins than in case of traditional presentation in form of @xmath1 - and @xmath0 - dependencies , this will allow to verify the results of our preceding work  @xcite in more favourable conditions , i.e. to confirm that in electroproduction of hadrons in nuclear medium we indeed observe scaling , where @xmath3 takes over the role of the scaling variable . + this paper is organized as follows . nuclear attenuation in an absorption model is presented in the next section . in section 3",
    "we discuss the choice of an appropriate form for the variable @xmath3 .",
    "section 4 presents results of the fit .",
    "conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "the semi - inclusive dis of lepton on nucleus of atomic mass number a is @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the initial ( final ) leptons and the hadron observed in the final state .",
    "this process is usually investigated in terms of @xmath2 : @xmath17 experimental data are usually presented at precise values of one variable and average values of another - dependence is studied , we have @xmath18 , where @xmath19 are the average values of @xmath0 for each @xmath1 bin . for @xmath0 - dependence @xmath20,where",
    "@xmath21 are the average values of @xmath1 for each @xmath0 bin . ] . in this work",
    "we adopt a model according to which the origin of the nuclear attenuation is the absorption of the prehadron ( string , dipole ) and final hadron in the nuclear medium . in that case @xmath2 has the following form : @xmath22^{(a-1)}dx}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the impact parameter and @xmath24 the longitudinal coordinate of the dis point .",
    "@xmath25 is the nuclear density function with a normalization condition @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 is the probability that neither the prehadron nor the final hadron @xmath16 are absorbed by a nucleon located anywhere in the nucleus .",
    "for @xmath27 we use the one - scale model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the inelastic cross sections for prehadron - nucleon and hadron - nucleon interactions , respectively .",
    "generally speaking @xmath29 is a function of the distance @xmath31 , @xmath1 and @xmath0 . is a function of formation time @xmath3 rather than a function of variables @xmath1 and @xmath0 separately",
    "] however a comparison of simple theoretical models containing @xmath29 as a parameter  @xcite , with the experimental data obtained in different kinematical regions , ( in particular in different domains of @xmath1 ) , shows that the approximation @xmath32 leads to a very acceptable agreement with the data .",
    "further , taking into account the qualitative character of this work , we shall use this approximation . in the region of moderate energies ,",
    "@xmath30 are approximately constant for all @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath33 is the probability that at distance @xmath31 from the dis point , the particle is a prehadron and @xmath34 is the probability that the particle is a hadron .",
    "the abovementioned probabilities are related via a condition @xmath35 in analogy with the survival probability for a particle having lifetime @xmath3 in a system where it travels a distance @xmath31 before decaying , @xmath33 can be expressed in the form @xmath36 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the formation time .",
    "substituting expressions for @xmath33 and @xmath34 in eq.(4 ) one obtains @xmath37 in the framework of our suppositions about @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath38 depends on @xmath1 and @xmath0 only by means of @xmath39 .",
    "+ in more detail , the formation time in the string models can be divided in two parts ( see , for instance , the two scale model presented in refs .",
    "the first part is the constituent formation time @xmath40 , which defines the time elapsed from the moment of the dis untill the production of the first constituent of the final hadron .",
    "the second time interval begins with the production of the first constituent until the second one , which coincides with the yo - yo or final hadron production .",
    "comparison with the experimental data shows that in the second interval , the prehadron - nucleon cross section has values close to the hadron - nucleon cross section @xmath30 . if the difference between these cross - sections is neglected , the model is reduced to one scale model with @xmath41 . substituting @xmath27 in @xmath2 we obtain @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the maximal power of @xmath3 with which we are limited .",
    "although @xmath2 is a polynomial of @xmath3 with maximal power @xmath44 , it is expected that @xmath45 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath46 depend on @xmath47 and nuclear density . for fit",
    "we use three expressions for @xmath2 as first , second and third order polynomials of @xmath3 : @xmath48={a_{11 } + \\tau a_{12 } } , \\hspace{2.35cm}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath49={a_{21 } + \\tau a_{22 } + \\tau^2 a_{23 } } , \\hspace{1.1cm}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath50={a_{31 } + \\tau a_{32 } + \\tau^2 a_{33 } + \\tau^3 a_{34}}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to get the information on the influence of highest order polynomial forms for @xmath2 , @xmath51 $ ] expression also was checked ( see section 4 ) .",
    "equation ( 8) shows that within our approximation , @xmath2 depends on @xmath1 and @xmath0 only by means of @xmath39 .",
    "this is the reason why we call @xmath3 a scaling variable . in this section",
    "we shall discuss the physical meaning and possible expressions of the formation time @xmath3 .",
    "there are different definitions for the formation time .",
    "we define it as a time scale which is necessary for the prehadron - nucleon cross section to reach the value of the hadron - nucleon cross - section . in the literature",
    "there are three qualitatively different definitions for @xmath3 . in the first extreme case",
    "it is assumed that @xmath52 ( glauber approach ) . in the second extreme case @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the nuclear radius ( energy loss model  @xcite ) . and at last , and in our opinion more realistic definition of the formation time , as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath0 which can change from zero up to values larger than @xmath54 .",
    "experimental data seem to confirm that for moderate values of @xmath1 ( on the order of @xmath55 ) the formation time is comparable with the nuclear size , i.e. the hadronization mostly takes place within the nucleus .",
    "this follows from the comparison of the experimental data for @xmath2 obtained in the region of moderate  @xcite and high  @xcite energies . at moderate energies",
    "@xmath2 significantly differs from unity and is a sensitive function of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , at high energies @xmath56 and weakly depends on @xmath1 and @xmath0 . for the formation time we shall use expressions which do not contradict the third definition mentioned above",
    "the following expressions are used : + 1 .",
    "formation time for the leading hadron  @xcite , which follows from the energy - momentum conservation law @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the string tension ( string constant ) with numerical value @xmath59 .",
    "formation time for the fast hadron , which is composed of characteristic formation time of the hadron @xmath16 in its rest frame @xmath60 and lorentz factor ( see , for instance , ref .",

    "@xcite we have discussed formation time @xmath63 in detail .",
    "in particular we considered the possibility of that @xmath60 being proportional to @xmath62 . in the present paper",
    "we have to deal with hadrons of one type only - charged pions - and looking at interested @xmath1 and @xmath0 dependencies of @xmath3 , because all factors , which do not depend from these variables , can only renormalize coefficients @xmath46 ( see equations ( 9)-(11 ) ) .",

    "is similar , i.e. they are decreasing with the increase of @xmath0 , while @xmath3 defined as in eq.(13 ) is increasing with the increase of @xmath0 .",
    "the two - dimensional data from  @xcite , i.e. the multiplicity ratio @xmath2 for charged pions produced on helium , neon , krypton and xenon nuclei , in a @xmath0 slices as a function of @xmath1 , and in a @xmath1 slices as a function of @xmath0 were used to perform the fit .",
    "= 8.cm = 10.cm    the independent fit including 47 experimental points was performed for each nucleus . as it is clear from eq.(2 ) , experimental points corresponding to @xmath1 - dependence @xmath18 , and @xmath0 - dependence @xmath20 enter in fit on equal basis , as a values of function @xmath68 at values of variables @xmath69 equal @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively . for the fit @xmath2",

    ", they have opposite behavior as a functions of @xmath63 .",
    "this indicates that @xmath87 and @xmath88 can serve as scaling variables , but @xmath63 can not .",

    "we conclude that experimentally measured function @xmath2 is a function of single variable @xmath3 , and that @xmath3 scaling follows naturally from the absorption model , but we do not confirm that scaling is a property of an absorption model only",
