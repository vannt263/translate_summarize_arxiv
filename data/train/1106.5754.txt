    "we will show that the observed transmission resonance @xcite and its enhanced quality factor as a function of the size of the system result from the formation of a collective mode whose decay rate becomes more suppressed for increased array sizes . within our model , a single asr , consisting of @xmath80 meta - atoms , has @xmath80 modes of oscillation , each of which decay at a rate comparable to the single , isolated meta - atom decay rate @xmath81 .",

    "while this quadrupole contribution can be inaccurately represented in the dipole approximation , in the case of an asr modes , the electric quadrupole moment is notably suppressed in most experimental situations when compared to the corresponding dipolar field @xcite .",
    "the dipole approximation also provides an advantage in computational efficiency and in maintaining the tractability of the calculation . despite the dipole approximation implemented in the numerics we find in section  [ sec : results :- linew - narr ] that the model is able to reproduce the experimental findings of the enhanced quality factor of the transmission resonance observed by fedotov _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of a single , isolated , asr are described by the two normal variables @xmath93 and @xmath94 for the right and left meta - atoms , respectively .",

    "when the spacing between meta - atoms is much less than a wavelength , the symmetric mode decays entirely due to electric dipole radiation , while the antisymmetric mode suffers decay from magnetic dipole radiation resulting in the asr mode decay rates @xmath113 furthermore , the symmetric and antisymmetric modes are driven purely by the external electric and magnetic fields respectively , with @xmath114 and @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the centre of mass of the asr .",
    "the asymmetry @xmath112 results in a coupling between the symmetric and antisymmetric modes .",

    "the coupling induced by the asymmetry , on the other hand , can allow such an incident field to additionally excite the antisymmetric mode .",
    "for example , figure [ fig : asrlevels ] illustrates an incident field resonant on the antisymmetric mode ( with @xmath118 ) , but which exclusively drives the symmetric mode .",

    "in practice , one does not observe excitation of a single asr s magnetic dipole by an incident field which solely drives the electric dipole .",
    "this is because the radiative decay rate of a magnetic dipole excitation in an isolated asr is approximately as fast as the decay rate of an electric dipole excitation .",

    "this radiation may become trapped through recurrent scattering processes in the array , representing modes with suppressed emission rates and reflectance , and resulting in a transmission resonance . in order to quantify the effect , we study the radiation properties ( for @xmath141 ) of the numerically calculated collective magnetic eigenmode @xmath136 of the system [ figure  [ fig : magneticmode ] ] which maximizes the overlap @xmath142 with the pure magnetic excitation in which all meta - atom magnetic dipoles oscillate in phase @xmath143 the alternating signs between elements of @xmath144 indicate that the current oscillations of the meta - atoms in an asr oscillate antisymmetrically .",
    "we then show that the introduction of an asymmetry @xmath112 in the resonances allows the excitation of @xmath136 by the incident field .",
    "this mode closely resembles that responsible for the experimentally observed transmission resonance @xcite .    in an infinite array ,",
    "each asr in the magnetic mode would be excited uniformly , perfectly matching the pure magnetic excitation @xmath145 in the absence of asymmetry .",
    "this changes in a finite system where boundary effects alter the distribution of the mode @xmath136 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : magneticmode ] which shows the numerically calculated uniform magnetic mode @xmath136 in an ensemble of @xmath146 asrs with a lattice spacing of @xmath147 as in the experiment of fedotov _ et al _ @xcite . to characterize this mode",
    ", we examine the electric ( symmetric ) and magnetic ( antisymmetric ) excitations of each asr .",
    "the state of asr @xmath148 ( @xmath149 ) is described by the excitations of its constituent meta - atoms , @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "therefore , as with a single asr ( [ eq : c_pm ] ) , the electric excitation @xmath152 and the magnetic excitation @xmath153 of asr @xmath148 are given by the respective symmetric and antisymmetric combinations @xmath154 the magnetic mode excitation consists largely of the asr magnetic dipoles oscillating in phase . in the absence of asymmetry",
    "the uniform magnetic mode in a regular array of asrs is almost exclusively magnetic in nature @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : magneticmode ] shows that , on the other hand , an asymmetry of @xmath155 provides a small electric dipole excitation to the magnetic mode , allowing it to be addressed by the incident field .     of the collective magnetic mode @xmath136 in the units of an isolated meta - atom linewidth @xmath81 as a function of the number of meta - molecules",

    "the split ring asymmetry only weakly affects @xmath136 . for @xmath167 ,",
    "the curves representing @xmath163 are indistinguishable from those for @xmath104 . for the relatively large @xmath168 , however",
    ", @xmath163 is increased for @xmath169 .",
    "this reduction in quality factor for larger @xmath1 results from the mixing of electric dipoles into the magnetic dipole mode ( see figure  [ fig : magneticmode ] ) , allowing the collective mode to emit in the forward and backward , @xmath170 , directions .",
    "the cooperative response and linewidth narrowing sensitively depends on the lattice spacing @xmath125 . for larger @xmath125 ( e.g. , @xmath171 )",
    ", @xmath163 becomes insensitive to @xmath1 , indicating the limit of independent scattering of isolated meta - molecules and a diminished role of cooperative effects .",
    "the collective behaviour can be understood because the asr magnetic dipoles emit largely into the plane of the metamaterial and the bulk of the magnetic mode excitation lies in its interior .",
    "any energy radiated from magnetic dipoles would preferentially come from the asrs near the edge of the metamaterial since radiation emitted from an asr on the interior would more likely be re - scattered by other asrs . on the other hand ,",
    "the fraction of asrs at the boundary varies inversely with @xmath1 leaving an ever larger proportion of the magnetic mode @xmath136 in the interior of the array for large @xmath1 . in the limit of an infinite array ( @xmath172 )",

    "the only bragg diffraction peak that the array could emit into corresponds to the forward and backward scattered fields since all other bragg peaks would be evanescent ; but both forward and backward emission from the magnetic dipoles are forbidden owing to their orientation .     of @xmath136 with the state",
    "@xmath173 excited by an incident field resonant on the mode @xmath136 ( for @xmath174 , and @xmath162 ) .",
    "for @xmath175 there is a range of asymmetries @xmath112 for which the incident field almost exclusively excites the mode @xmath136 . ]",
    "an asymmetry @xmath176 generates an effective coupling between the electric and magnetic dipoles of individual asrs in an array [ see ( [ eq : c_pm_evolve ] ) ] .",
    "this coupling produces a slight mixing of electric dipoles into the phase matched magnetic mode @xmath136 of the array as illustrated in figure  [ fig : magneticmode ] .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : overlap ] that the slight mixing of electric dipoles into @xmath136 permits its excitation by a uniform resonant driving field propagating perpendicular to the plane of the array . we represent the steady state excitation of the array induced by this field as @xmath173 .",
    "figure  [ fig : overlap ] shows the relative population @xmath177 [ see ( [ eq : overlap ] ) ] of the phase - matched magnetic mode @xmath136 .",
    "this population represents the fraction of @xmath173 that resides in the mode @xmath136 .",
    "we find that for @xmath178 and @xmath179 , one can induce a state in which more than @xmath180 of the energy is in the target mode @xmath136 . for @xmath181 , any excitation that ends up in @xmath136 is radiated away before it can accumulate ; the array behaves as a collection of radiating electric dipoles . for larger @xmath112 ,",
    "the population of @xmath136 decreases since the increased strength of the coupling between asr electric and magnetic dipoles begins to excite other modes with nearby resonance frequencies .",
    "although the density of modes which may be driven increases linearly with @xmath1 , the corresponding reduction of @xmath163 means that a smaller @xmath112 is needed to excite the target mode , and there is a range of asymmetries for which @xmath136 is populated .",
    "( stars ) from ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath182 denotes the single meta - atom quality factor ( for @xmath183 cm ) , and numerically calculated resonance linewidth @xmath163 of the collective magnetic mode @xmath136 with @xmath184 ( solid line ) and @xmath185 ( dashed line ) .",
    "here @xmath186 , and @xmath187 . ]",
    "the narrowing in @xmath163 combined with the near exclusive excitation of this mode implies that for larger arrays the radiation from the sheet is suppressed and hence the transmission enhanced as seen by fedotov _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "in figure  [ fig : linewidthexp ] we compare the experimentally observed transmission resonance  @xcite to our numerics .",
    "we use the experimental spacing @xmath188 .",
    "the numerical values for the asymmetry @xmath189 and the ratio between electric and magnetic spontaneous emission rates @xmath190 were estimated from the relative sizes of the asr meta - atoms @xcite and their relationship to the resonant wavelength in the experiments by fedotov _ et al _ @xcite . the spacing between the meta - atoms @xmath191",
    "was chosen so that the resonance frequencies of the mode @xmath136 and the collective mode in which all electric dipoles oscillate in phase are shifted by less than @xmath81 with respect to one and other so as to be consistent with experimental observations in @xcite . for a given non - zero @xmath72",
    ", one can obtain the collective decay rate of the magnetic mode by adding @xmath72 to the decay rate calculated in the absence of ohmic losses .",
    "we therefore fit the shape of the numerically calculated curve of the resonance linewidth as a function of the number of resonators to the experimental observations of fedotov _ et al _ @xcite using @xmath72 as a fitting parameter . the ohmic loss rate @xmath192 produces the expected saturation of quality factor for large @xmath1 .",
    "the vertical shift of the experimental data set is determined by the single meta - atom quality factor @xmath193 , and the best value @xmath194 is roughly consistent with full numerical solutions to maxwell s equations for scattering from a single asr presented by papasimakis _",
    "et al . _",
    "the excellent agreement of our simplified model that only includes dipole radiation contributions from each meta - atom can be understood by a notably weaker quadrupole than dipolar radiation field from an asr  @xcite .",
    "the result also confirms the importance of the uniform magnetic mode @xmath136 on the observed transmission resonance .",
    "the observed saturation is due to a combination of a fixed @xmath112 , which in larger arrays leads to the population of several other modes in addition to @xmath136 , and ohmic losses in the resonators which set an ultimate limit to the narrowing of @xmath163 .",
    "if ohmic losses were to be reduced , the quality factor of the resonance would saturate at a correspondingly higher value , as shown in figure [ fig : linewidthexp ] . in the displayed case the resonance linewidth narrowing",
    "is limited by the relatively large asymmetry @xmath195 . for larger arrays ,",
    "figure  [ fig : linewidth_theory ] indicates that one could further enhance the quality factor by reducing the asymmetry @xmath112 .",
    "so long as @xmath112 sufficiently exceeds the magnetic mode s decay rate @xmath163 , a large , and potentially greater , fraction of the metamaterial excitation would reside in the magnetic mode @xmath196 as shown in figure  [ fig : overlap ] .",
    "the reduced excitation of other collective modes could then further enhance the quality of the observed transmission resonance .",
    "a reduction or elimination of ohmic losses would therefore dramatically increase the resonance s quality factor in larger arrays .",
    "in conclusion , we analyzed the recent observations of transmission spectra in a metamaterial array of asrs .",
    "we showed that the system can exhibit a strong cooperative response in the case of sufficiently closely - spaced resonators .",
    "moreover , we demonstrated how an asymmetry in the split rings leads to excitation of collective magnetic modes by a field which does not couple directly to asr magnetic moments .",
    "the excitation of this uniform phase - coherent mode results in cooperative response exhibiting a dramatic resonance linewidth narrowing , explaining the experimental findings  @xcite .",
