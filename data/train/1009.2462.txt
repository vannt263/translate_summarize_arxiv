    "fluids dissipate energy as they flow through pipes or past any smooth or rough surface .",
    "examples include river flow or wind blowing across the land .",
    "this energy dissipation is proportional to the velocity gradient , or shear rate , of the flow at the bounding surface .",
    "this frictional energy loss , and its dependence on the reynolds number of the flow @xcite , is not yet fully understood a century after the first explanation was advanced by l. prandtl @xcite .",
    "here we introduce a new scheme for measuring the shear rate near a bounding surface .",
    "it also might be applicable in the interior of a fluid . unlike some widely - used methods @xcite , the shear rate @xmath3 is recorded at a single `` point '' of size @xmath4 .",
    "the motivation for developing this technique was to improve the usual method for measuring the shear rate in turbulent flows @xcite .",
    "the scheme introduced here is that of photon correlation spectroscopy ( pcs ) @xcite .",
    "it is a variant of that used by fuller and leal to study laminar flows @xcite . for turbulence ,",
    "the shear rate @xmath3 is a random variable .",
    "the pcs method enables determination of the time - averaged shear rate @xmath0 , its standard deviation @xmath1 , and the gaussian transform of the probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath2 itself . because the method has not been used before , the values of the mean shear @xmath0 obtained by pcs are compared with those measured by laser doppler velocimetry ( ldv ) @xcite .",
    "the pcs scheme has the advantage of improved signal - to - noise , short data - collection times , and also the compactness of the apparatus .",
    "the pcs scheme can be used when the mean flow rate is absent or present .",
    "hence it may be useful outside of the domain of turbulence studies . with the pcs scheme ,",
    "a single beam illuminates a group of moving particles that scatter light into a photodetector at some scattering angle @xmath5 .",
    "the inset of fig.[setup]a shows the incident and scattered laser beam of momentum @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively and the scattering vector @xmath8 at a point in the flowing soap film , an incident beam is focused to a bright spot of size @xmath4 . the intensity @xmath9 of the incident beam is taken to be gaussian form , @xmath10 figure [ setup]b , a side view of the setup ,",
    "will be discussed below .",
    "the velocity at any point @xmath11 can then be written as the velocity at the center of the spot @xmath11=0 plus a term proportional to the shear rate tensor @xmath12 , which is the quantity of interest .",
    "the dominant component of @xmath13 near a wall in this experiment is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is in the flow direction @xmath16 while @xmath17 is in the transverse direction in the film plane .",
    "note that @xmath3 is a scalar quantity .",
    "let @xmath18 be the velocity of an illuminated particle at a horizontal distance @xmath17 from the center of the incident beam ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "then @xmath20 where the higher order terms have been neglected .    within a multiplicative constant , the scattered electric field from @xmath21 particles within the incident beam at time @xmath22",

    ".    it will first be assumed that the flow is laminar , so that @xmath12 is time - independent , that is to say , the pdf of the shear tensor is a delta function centered at the mean value of @xmath12 . then the intensity correlation function which is simply related to the electric field autocorrelation function through the bloch - siegert theorem @xcite ( which is applicable to any gaussian pdf , including a delta function ) is @xmath29 where @xmath30    evaluating ( 3 ) , using ( 1)-(2 ) and averaging over @xmath22 gives a result previously obtained by fuller et al .",

    ", the turbulent soap film flows in the @xmath16 direction with mean velocity @xmath33 , where this average is over the width @xmath34 of the soap film . then @xmath35 where @xmath36 is an average over time .",
    "use has been made here of the gaussian form of the incident beam .    because @xmath3 is a random function for turbulent flows , an additional average over @xmath3",
    "is needed , giving @xmath37 ( with @xmath2 having its maximum near @xmath0 ) ; @xmath31 is the gaussian transform of @xmath38    two important parameters , in addition to @xmath4 , are @xmath34 and the reynolds number , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the kinematic viscosity of the soap solution .",
    "if the supporting walls that bound the film flow are not smooth , their roughness @xmath41 is another important control parameter . as in three dimensions one expects @xcite the dimensionless frictional drag @xmath42 to be independent of @xmath43 when it is sufficiently large .",

    "these strips are glued to thin plastic wires 0.5 mm in diameter that join to form an inverted v at the top and at the bottom , as indicated in fig.[setup ] . at the apex",
    ", a small tube connects the reservoir to a valve v that controls the flow rate .",
    "the wires at the bottom connect and deliver the spent soap solution to reservoir rb , where it is pumped back to the top reservoir rt to keep the flow rate steady .",
    "typical flow rates of the soap solution are @xmath50 0.2 ml / s .    the soap solution is 1% dawn dishwashing detergent in water . it is loaded with neutrally buoyant polystyrene particles which scatter the incident beam from a 5 mw 633 nm he - ne laser into the photodetector , a perkin elmer spcm - aqr-12-fc .",
    "the laser source is located behind the soap film while the photodetector is located in front of it as shown in fig.[setup]b .",

    "@xmath4 is limited by the wavelength of visible light , focal length of the focusing lens and the diameter of the incident beam and has a value of @xmath4 = 100 @xmath51 m .",
    "the scattering vector @xmath52 is in the vertical ( @xmath16 ) direction and the dominant component of the shear rate is @xmath53 the diameter @xmath54 of the seed particles ( 0.4 @xmath51 m ) is sufficiently small that their stokes number in the strongest turbulence is less than 0.1 @xcite",
    ". hence the particle velocities are adequately close to that of the fluid .",

    "typically , the scattering angle @xmath55 , @xmath56 m@xmath57 . using a seed - particle density of 1.5 gm / l yields an average photon counting rate of 10@xmath58 hz .",
    "experiments were performed with a horizontally oriented comb penetrating the soap film at a point above the measuring point and with the comb absent . only with the comb present",
    "is the turbulence reasonably developed and the energy spectrum is of scaling form , @xmath59 , with @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "this is the @xmath61 , defined as the interval where vorticity of larger size fluctuations cascade to smaller scales . in two dimensions",
    "there is also a cascade of energy fluctuations to larger scales , where @xmath62 = 5/3 , as in three dimensions .",
    "however , it is not accessible for decaying turbulence , as in this experiment @xcite . by making the bounding walls rough , so that turbulence is constantly being generated there , the inverse energy cascade",
    "can also be seen @xcite .",
    "the teeth of the comb as well as their spacing is 2 mm .    to further test the pcs technique ,",
    "measurements are also made with the comb absent . in this case , there is no well - defined energy spectrum decaying as a power law .",
    "nevertheless the flow is far from laminar , so that @xmath0 can be measured by both pcs and ldv .",
    "to first order , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "however , experimentally @xmath31 is found to be a non - gaussian function . if @xmath65 , @xmath66 which is clearly non - gaussian in @xmath67 .",
    "both panels of fig .",
    "[ corrwall ] show that while @xmath2 is close to gaussian form , the gaussian fit ( solid lines ) is not perfect .",
    "these `` good '' fits to gaussian form were unexpected .",
    "there are two other effects that can contribute to the decay of @xmath31 : thermal diffusion of the seed particles and transit time broadening , which can be dominant for large @xmath68 .",
    "both of these contributions are small in these experiments but are easy to correct for @xcite . to take diffusion into account , one multiplies eq . ( 4 ) by the factor , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the diffusion constant , which , for spherical particles of diameter @xmath54 is @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath73 is viscosity .    as for the transit time effect ,",
    "particles passing through a beam of size @xmath4 produce a burst of light intensity that temporally modulates the scattered light .",
    "the multiplicative correction factor here is @xmath74@xcite .",
    "the decay times for both of these effects is long compared to the viscous decay time of interest so these multiplicative time factors can be dropped .",
    "for example , with a spot size @xmath75 m and a typical mean velocity of @xmath33 = 1 m / sec , the transit time @xmath76 associated with the effect is or order @xmath77 0.1 ms .",
    "this is fifty times longer than typically measured @xmath78 .",
    "diffusion times are much longer than this and hence contribute insignificantly to the decay of @xmath31 .",
    "fig.[corrwall ] shows @xmath31 for measurements made with the comb absent ( a ) and present ( b ) , respectively . here",
    "@xmath79 2 m / s in both experiments , @xmath34=2 cm , and @xmath4 = 100 @xmath51 m .",
    "the vertical axis is linear , but the horizontal axis is @xmath80 , so as to display several decades of lag time .",
    "the insets to both figures show @xmath81 vs @xmath82 , so that a gaussian decay of @xmath31 appears as a straight line .",
    "the straight lines in the lower insets indicate that @xmath31 is indeed of gaussian form for very small @xmath67 .",
    "they are a best fit to the experimental curves and correspond @xmath0 = 1600 s@xmath57 and 1000 s@xmath57 for the experiments with and without the comb .",
    "the solid lines in the upper insets to fig.[corrwall ] are best fits under the assumption of a gaussian @xmath38 a good fit clearly extends beyond the small-@xmath67 limit and enables the determination of the standard deviations @xmath1 of the mean shear as well as @xmath0 itself . the mean shear @xmath0 is calculated from the definition of variance , @xmath83 .",
    "the results are @xmath0 = 950 hz @xmath1 = 300 hz with the comb absent and @xmath0 = 1620 hz @xmath1 = 500 hz with the comb present .",
    "the ratio of @xmath1 to @xmath0 is near 20 % .",
    "the shear measurement is done in the viscosity - dominated layer of width @xmath84 , where @xmath16 is the distance from the comb .",
    "ideally the spot size @xmath4 should be much smaller than @xmath84 .",
    "the function @xmath85 is proportional to @xmath17 within @xmath84 .",
    "prior experiments have established that at @xmath16 = 20 cm below the comb , where the measurements were made , @xmath86 is roughly 200 @xmath51 m @xcite .",
    "thus the beam size @xmath4 is small enough to correctly measure the viscous shear rate .",
    "the single - point pcs measurements of @xmath0 are now compared with those of ldv , made in the traditional way ; the vertical velocity component @xmath15 is measured at two nearby horizontally - spaced points in the viscosity - dominated interval .",
    "the ldv measurements were made 2.5 cm below the pcs beam spot , which is 80 cm below point p in fig.[setup ] and 20 cm below the comb .",
    "the ldv measurement point is advanced in 50 @xmath51 m steps starting at @xmath17=0 .",
    "the minimum useful value of @xmath17 is dictated by the necessity of avoiding strong light scattering from the supporting plastic strip with its edge at @xmath17=0 .",
    "the ldv laser source is 514 nm line from a coherent argon - ion laser operating at a power of 500 mw , roughly one hundred times that used in the pcs device .",
    "the data collection time for each measurement of @xmath85 is roughly 20 s. because the correlation time is of the order of microseconds , and the counting rate is of the order of mhz the function form of @xmath31 emerges after only a few seconds of data collection with the correlator .",
    "the mean shear rate @xmath0 in the viscous region obtained by ldv and pcs agree to within one standard deviation , as seen in table [ tab : comb_shear_rate ] .",
    "the uncertainties are deduced from seven measurements made at the indicated values of @xmath33 . from an individual run",
    ", one can not extract @xmath1 from the ldv data , because noise fluctuations can change even the sign of @xmath87 .",

    "the errors from one run to another are _ not _ statistical in origin .",
    "rather , the source is variations in the flow speed through the valve and the motion of the film plane caused by velocity fluctuations of the surrounding air which could be only partially suppressed by placing the entire apparatus in a tent .",
