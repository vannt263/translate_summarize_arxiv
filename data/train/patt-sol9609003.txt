    "close to a pattern - forming transition , many hydrodynamic systems can be described by coupled one - dimensional ( 1d ) ginzburg - landau equations for some envelope functions ( order parameters ) @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "these equations were first introduced in an explicit form ( with purely real coefficients , but also with the group - velocity terms ) by cross @xcite . in the presence of a small over - criticality parameter , and when rewritten in terms of two real amplitudes and two real phases , these equations for two complex order parameters are completely tantamount to a single fourth - order complex equation ( the `` complex swift - hohenberg '' equation ) introduced still earlier in ref .",
    "as is well known , the coefficient in front of the cross - coupling ( cc ) term is an essential parameter of these equations . for a small cc coefficient , homogenous bimodal states of the form @xmath2 occur , while for sufficiently large cc ,",
    "this bimodal state is unstable , and",
    "the system evolves into a single - mode state in which either @xmath0 or @xmath1 is zero @xcite . in this work , we consider the case that the cc coefficient is a function of the spatial coordinate @xmath3 . in particular , we focus on the case that the cc coefficient is slightly above @xmath4 for @xmath5 and slightly below @xmath4 for @xmath6 . the simplest state that can occur in this case",
    "is a spatial juxtaposition of a single and a bimodal state , separated by a so - called domain - wall .",
    "we study this domain - wall in the nld , rgl , and cgl equations .",
    "we show that non - variational effects can destroy the stationary domain - wall and study the dynamical states that occur in this case .",
    "in particular we focus on the effect of the group - velocity terms in the coupled equations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we introduce a simplified model for the occurrence of domain - walls . for stationary solutions of this model",
    "we derive a perturbation equation that allows us to predict the vanishing of stationary domain - walls when the group - velocity is sufficiently large .",
    "this is confirmed by numerical simulations of this model , and we describe the ensuing dynamical states .",
    "we study the relevance of this model for coupled rgl and cgl equations by performing numerical simulations .",
    "in particular for the cgl equations , a broad spectrum of dynamical behavior is observed , including spatio - temporal chaos .",
    "it is very difficult to characterize these states , and we restrict ourself to a limited exploration of the possible dynamical states .",
    "some of the essential features of the cgl equations that are important in the study of the domain - wall , i.e. , the stability of the single and bimodal states as a function of the cc can also be studied in simpler models .",
    "we will first consider two coupled nonlinear diffusion ( nld ) equations , to which we add group - velocity terms borrowed from the cgl equation that break the variational representation of the nld equations ( however , the group - velocity terms should not be added in the above - mentioned case of the rayleigh - bnard convection in the inhomogeneous large - aspect - ratio system @xcite ) . in the simplest approach , we take the amplitudes real - valued :    @xmath7    these nld equations are the simplest set of equations that admit the dw s that we are interested in .",
    "these equations have no direct physical interpretation in terms of amplitude equations , but they have the advantage over more realistic models that the effect of the group - velocity terms on the domain - walls can be studied analytically . since the group - velocity terms have opposite sign for the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 equation of the coupled cgl equations ( [ cgl ] ) , we retain this property in the nld equations . without the cross - coupling ,",
    "the group - velocity terms generate a counter propagation of the patterns in @xmath0 and @xmath1 . when the equations for @xmath0 and @xmath1 are coupled , the effect of the group - velocity terms can not be given in terms of a simple propagation rule .",
    "we will derive , in a certain limit , a single ordinary differential equation for the order parameter @xmath8 that describes stationary configurations . using this equation",
    ", we will be able to investigate the existence of a stationary dw analytically . in section [ varisec ]",
    "we consider the case that the group - velocity terms are absent .",
    "the equations are then variational and for the particular case that the cc coefficient , as a function of the spatial coordinate @xmath3 , is proportional to @xmath9 , an exact analytical solution for the dw can be obtained .",
    "next , we extend in section [ nldevsec ] the equation for @xmath10 to include the non - variational group - velocity terms , and when we take @xmath11 to be a step function , an analytical solution can be constructed . analyzing the latter solution",
    ", we find a transition from a regime where the dw is stationary to a regime where no stationary dw exists .",
    "this transition , which we show to have a nice geometrical interpretation , occurs when the group - velocity @xmath12 is equal to the critical value @xmath13 .",
    "we will show that this result remains valid for a broad class of inhomogeneous cc coefficients .",
    "direct simulations of the coupled nld equations , presented in section [ secfknum ] , confirm the analytical results and show that there is a value of the group - velocity , @xmath14 , where the stationary domain - wall looses its stability .",
    "this instability occurs because the position of the domain - wall diverges when @xmath12 approaches @xmath15 .",
    "the difference between @xmath15 and @xmath14 is of the order of a few percent . for a group - velocity just beyond @xmath14",
    ", the dw is seen to perform small - amplitude chaotic oscillations around a mean position , without essentially disturbing the dw s shape .",
    "the study of the coupled cgl equations is of a more explorative nature . as a first step towards the study of the full coupled cgl equations , we allow the amplitudes @xmath0 and @xmath1 to be complex valued .",
    "these equations are reminiscent of the rgl equations , but it should be noted that in physical applications , the rgl equations have no group - velocity terms ; nevertheless we refer to this model as the coupled rgl equations .",
    "we explain that the main properties of the stationary domain - walls in this model can be described by the nld equations .",
    "simulations of coupled rgl equations , presented in section [ rglsec ] , show a transition between the stationary domain - walls and a dynamical state with the increase of the group - velocity that is similar to the nld - case .",
    "the role of wavenumbers of the initial conditions , which constitutes the main feature that is not present in the nld equations , is discussed briefly .    for the coupled cgl equations ,",
    "the numerical results presented in section [ cglsec ] show that the nonlinear dispersion terms may render the domain - walls unstable , even when the group - velocity terms are absent .",
    "spatio - temporal disordered states often occur .",
    "the oscillations of the dw can be understood qualitatively to arise from the large gradients of @xmath16 and @xmath17 around the domain - wall .",
    "it may be pertinent to note that both complex and real ginzburg - landau equations with the coefficients in front of the _ linear _ terms smoothly depending upon the spatial coordinate have been the subject of many studies @xcite .",
    "it was found that a parameter ramp in the real or complex gl equation can perform wavenumber selection @xcite . in the case of the full cgl equation",
    ", it can also render the single - mode traveling waves unstable , and can trap subcritical solitary pulses @xcite .",
    "however , as far as we know , there have been no studies aimed to consider effects of a spatial dependence in the coefficient in front of the nonlinear cc term .",
    "a spatially dependent cc can be realized in rayleigh - bnard convection in a rotating annulus of non - constant width @xcite .",
    "convection in rotating systems has recently been the focus of several studies @xcite , and quasi-1d traveling waves were shown to occur in these systems near the vertical side - walls of the annulus . in a rotating annulus , there are two so - called wall modes , localized , respectively , near its inner and outer side walls .",
    "note that there is only one wall - mode per side - wall ( instead of two ) ; this is due to a symmetry breaking that is induced by the rotation @xcite .",
    "the amplitude equations describing slow modulations of these modes in the co - rotating reference frame are two coupled cubic complex ginzburg - landau ( cgl ) equations @xcite .",
    "the strength of the cc between the two wall modes sensitively depends on the width of the annulus .",
    "when the annulus is not uniform but has a varying width , the corresponding cc can be made to vary across its critical value as a function of the longitudinal spatial coordinate ( which is going along the circumference of the rotating annulus ) .",
    "other coefficients of the amplitude equations describing such a system will also depend on this coordinate , but if we assume that these coefficients , in contrast to the cc coefficient , are not close to a critical value , their spatial dependence may be ignored , provided that it is smooth enough .",
    "a similar problem may be implemented in a related but different physical system , viz .",
    ", the rayleigh - bnard convection in a ( non - rotating ) large - aspect - ratio cell . in this case , the two modes are two orthogonal sets of parallel rolls .",
    "a single - mode state is stable provided that an effective cc coefficient between the orthogonal rolls is larger than a certain minimum value , while in the opposite case a square - lattice pattern ( the bimodal state obtained as a superposition of two orthogonal sets of rolls ) is stable @xcite . usually , the actual value of the cc coefficient is well above the above - mentioned minimum , so that the square lattice is unstable .",
    "however , in special cases , e.g. , for the convection between horizontal surfaces with poor heat conductivity , the cc coefficient may fall below the minimum @xcite .",
    "one may construct a suitable inhomogeneous system , for example , by means of a variable - thickness lid put on top of the convection layer , such that the local cc coefficient , being a function of the spatial coordinates , is passing through the minimum value .",
    "then one may expect a stationary dw separating the rolls and square lattice , which is impossible in the homogeneous system @xcite .",
    "in this section we will focus on the coupled nld and rgl equations , which are the simplest sets of equations where a dw between a single - mode and a bimodal state can occur .",
    "the dynamics of these systems without the group - velocity terms are relaxational in the sense that a lyapunov functional @xmath18 exists for each of them , allowing to predict final states by minimizing it .",
    "we derive a perturbation theory for a weak inhomogeneity in the cross - coupling coefficients of the coupled nld equations , that allows us to find a closed - form expression for the dw for a special choice of the inhomogeneity .",
    "this perturbation theory will be a starting point in the next subsection , where we will focus on the group - velocity terms that make the equations non - variational .",
    "the equations that we consider in this section are    [ rglstat ] @xmath19    where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are real - valued in the nld case , and complex in the rgl case .",
    "the critical value of @xmath20 is @xmath4 : for @xmath21 the bimodal state @xmath22 is stable , whereas for @xmath23 this bimodal state loses its stability and the single - mode state with @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( or vice versa ) becomes stable @xcite . the cc coefficient @xmath11 is assumed to decrease monotonically from slightly above to slightly below its critical value as a function of the spatial coordinate @xmath3 . in what follows below , we will set @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a small monotonically decreasing function of the spatial coordinate @xmath3 , such that @xmath27 is positive at @xmath28 and negative at @xmath29 .",
    "we assume that @xmath30 saturates at @xmath31 , i.e. , it assumes certain asymptotic values @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "the solution that one expects for this choice of @xmath11 is a stationary dw located around @xmath34 which matches the single - mode and bimodal states existing , respectively , for negative and positive @xmath3 .",
    "the coupled rgl equations can be derived from the lyapunov functional @xmath35 by setting @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "as is commonly known , the lyapunov functional may only decrease in time , and , as it is bounded from below , a final state corresponds to a minimum of @xmath18 .",
    "the final state that corresponds to a global minimum of @xmath18 has a zero wave number , which suggests to consider also the particular case of real @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "thus one obtains the coupled nld equations . for finite systems with periodic boundary conditions",
    ", the rgl equations may evolve to stationary states with nonzero wavenumber .",
    "this is discussed in section [ rglstatsec ] .",
    "we will now focus on the stationary solutions of the nld equations , and set the derivatives with respect to time equal to zero .",
    "the ensuing equations can be written as four coupled ordinary differential equations for the real - valued @xmath0 , @xmath38 , @xmath1 and @xmath39 .",
    "when we identify @xmath0 and @xmath1 with position coordinates and their derivatives with generalized momentum coordinates , the equations for a stationary domain - wall can be written as the _ hamilton equations _ corresponding to the hamiltonian @xmath40 where @xmath3 is the `` time '' coordinate .",
    "although the hamiltonian is similar to the lyapunov functional , the difference in the signs that occur between these expressions should be noted . in general",
    "we can not solve the hamilton equations for arbitrary @xmath27 . to proceed we will develop a perturbation expansion by taking @xmath41 and @xmath42 small .",
    "we will complement this condition by the assumption that @xmath43 and @xmath44 are slowly varying functions of @xmath3 , so that the diffusive terms in eqs .",
    "( [ rglstat ] ) are small in comparison with the other terms below we will determine , in a self - consistent way , that the spatial scale @xmath45 over which @xmath0 and @xmath1 vary is of order @xmath46 . when the diffusive terms and the coupling term @xmath47 of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) are small , it follows that @xmath48 is almost constant @xcite .",
    "this suggests the following representation for @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xcite : @xmath49the single - mode states are those with @xmath10 being an integer multiple of @xmath50 , and bimodal states have @xmath51 ( throughout this paper , @xmath52 will represent an integer ) . when we substitute this representation into the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) we obtain @xmath53 where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath3 .",
    "stationary solutions of the coupled nld equations are found by determining the minima of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) . since we assumed that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are slowly varying , and that @xmath54 is almost constant , @xmath55 and in the simplest non - trivial approximation we may set @xmath54 equal to one @xcite .",
    "differentiating the hamiltonian ( [ hchi ] ) with respect to @xmath3 and neglecting higher order terms , we obtain the following perturbation equation : @xmath56where the prime stand for @xmath57 .",
    "it follows from here that the relation between the small quantity @xmath58 and a large scale @xmath45 of variation of the function @xmath59 , which was implicitly assumed above , is @xmath60 @xcite .    as an example",
    ", we may solve eq .",
    "( [ chi  ] ) exactly for the special choice @xmath61 .",
    "the solution is then @xmath62which can be verified by substitution ; note the scaling of @xmath3 with @xmath63 .",
    "this choice for @xmath27 and the corresponding solution are shown in fig . 1 for @xmath64 .",
    "we will proceed by investigating whether this type of the dw solutions exist for more general @xmath27 and when the group - velocity terms are included .",
    "in this section we will investigate what happens to the domain - walls when the group - velocity terms that are similar to those in the cgl equation are included in the nld equations .",
    "these terms destroy the variational structure of the nld equations , hence their final states need no longer be stationary .",
    "we will show that stationary dw s can not exist when the group - velocity is above a certain critical value .",
    "numerical simulations of the nld equations corroborate this prediction , and show that , beyond the threshold , time - periodic or disordered states occur",
    ".    the nld equations with the group - velocity terms are    [ fk ] @xmath7    as was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can use a _ balance equation _ for the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) to treat effects of the small group - velocity terms on the stationary solutions . differentiating ( [ h ] ) and making use of the stationary version of eqs .",
    "( [ fk ] ) , one finds @xmath65 ~. \\label{eqwithc}\\]]using the `` polar '' representation defined by eqs .",
    "( [ chi ] ) yields an effective equation for @xmath10 , which is a generalization of eq .",
    "( [ chi  ] ) ( the same equation , albeit for constant @xmath58 , was obtained in ref . [ 13 ] ) : @xmath66this equation is the basis for the perturbative analysis presented below .    it should be noted that this equation is invariant under a scale transformation @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "this freedom can in principle be used to scale out @xmath12 , but we will not do this ; this scale - invariance is reflected , however , in the formula for @xmath15 that is obtained below",
    ".      it will be convenient to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ balance ] ) in the form of a two - dimensional _ non - autonomous _ dynamical system :    [ dynamical]@xmath70    fixed points of eqs .",
    "( [ dynamical ] ) are @xmath71 , which correspond to single - mode stationary solutions of equations of eqs .",
    "( [ fk ] ) at even @xmath52 , and to bimodal solutions at odd @xmath52 .",
    "hetero - clinic orbits going from one fixed point at pseudo - time @xmath72 to another fixed point at @xmath73 correspond to the dw s that we are interested in .",
    "since we have chosen @xmath27 to be a decreasing function of @xmath3 , these orbits go from a fixed point with even @xmath52 to one with odd @xmath52 .",
    "the system ( [ dynamical ] ) is invariant with respect to the following symmetry transformations :    * @xmath74 , * @xmath75 , @xmath76 . * @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath76 , @xmath79 .    with regard to these symmetries ,",
    "it is sufficient to consider only the hetero - clinic orbit that goes from the fixed point @xmath80 , to be referred to as fp0 , to the bimodal fixed point @xmath81 , which will be called fp1 ; the other dw s can be obtained by applying a combination of the transformations ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) to this hetero - clinic orbit .",
    "an essential feature of the dynamical system ( [ dynamical ] ) is that the direction of the phase - flow in the @xmath82 plane is not fixed , but depends on the current value of @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , even when the functional form of @xmath58 is fixed , the possible orbits of equation ( [ dynamical ] ) through a certain point form , in general , a one - parameter family .",
    "however , when we take @xmath27 to be a step function , i.e. ,    [ step ] @xmath83    there are only 2 orbits through a certain point ; one for @xmath84 ( @xmath28 ) and one for @xmath85 ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "notice that the lack of continuity of @xmath27 does not contradict the assumption that the stationary solution for @xmath10 is a smooth function of @xmath3 ; we will see below that solutions corresponding to this discontinuous @xmath30 are smooth indeed .",
    "in fact , the scaling properties of equation ( [ balance ] ) , that also hold for the dynamical system ( [ dynamical ] ) yield that when we rescale @xmath67 , with @xmath86 , the function @xmath27 becomes effectively steeper due to the rescaling of the spatial - coordinate ; when @xmath87 , @xmath27 becomes , in a sense , infinitely small and infinitely steep .",
    "we are now interested in the behavior of the hetero - clinic orbits as a function of @xmath12 .",
    "a hetero - clinic trajectory corresponding to the dw exists provided that the the outgoing ( unstable ) manifold of fp0 , which we will refer to as @xmath88 , intersects the ingoing ( stable ) manifold of fp1 , to be referred to as @xmath89 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig2sub ] ) .",
    "obviously , @xmath90 and @xmath91 have to be calculated , respectively , for @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the question of existence of a domain - wall has thus been reduced to checking whether @xmath90 and @xmath91 intersect .",
    "the point of intersection then gives the values of @xmath10 and @xmath94 at @xmath34 .",
    "this is illustrated in the figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig2sub ] , where we have plotted , for @xmath95 and @xmath96 , these two manifolds for a range of values of the group - velocity .",
    "the point of intersection has by definition @xmath34 , and so from these figs .",
    "we can read off the values of @xmath10 and @xmath97 at @xmath34 as a function of @xmath12 .",
    "the point of intersection of @xmath90 and @xmath91 shifts towards fp0 when @xmath12 is decreased . as a consequence , the location of the domain - wall , i.e , the value of @xmath3 where @xmath98 , shifts to larger and larger values .",
    "in fact , when @xmath12 approaches a certain value which we define as @xmath15 , the intersection of @xmath90 and @xmath91 approaches fp0 and the location of the domain - wall , that corresponds to the hetero - clinic orbit , diverges to infinity ( see fig . [ statfig ] ) .    below we will find that @xmath99 .",
    "note that the square - root dependence follows from the scaling properties ; only the numerical factor @xmath100 needs to be determined .",
    "there are two complementary methods for the determination of the critical velocity .",
    "the first method involves analytically solving the flow - line equations of the dynamical system ( [ dynamical ] ) and the second method involves an inspection of the geometry of the flow - lines . after a description of these two methods",
    "we discuss the validity of @xmath15 for inhomogeneities that are not of the form ( [ step ] ) .",
    "the manifolds @xmath90 and @xmath91 can be found exactly when @xmath58 is piecewise constant , as in eqs .",
    "( [ step ] ) , because we can solve the equation for the trajectories of the dynamical system ( [ dynamical ] ) explicitly when @xmath58 is a constant .",

    "the intersection point can be found by substituting @xmath116 into eq .",
    "( [ sol1 ] ) .    simply solving the ensuing equation numerically yields that @xmath91 and @xmath90 intersect only ( apart from the intersection at fp0 itself ) when @xmath117where it should be noted that @xmath12 is assumed to be negative .",
    "this means that if the group - velocity @xmath12 , which is amenable for the non - variational effects in this model , is below the threshold @xmath118 , there can not be a stationary dw .",
    "it should be noted that we have focused here on the domain - wall that has a single - mode state for negative @xmath3 and a bimodal state for positive @xmath3 .",
    "when we reflect @xmath3 , and study a domain - wall of opposite chirality , i.e. , going from a bimodal state at @xmath119 to a single - mode state at @xmath120 , according to symmetry ( iii ) the critical velocity changes sign .",
    "when @xmath27 goes from negative values for @xmath28 to positive values for @xmath29 , the ensuing stationary domain - walls can not exist for sufficiently large _ positive _ @xmath12 .",
    "we will encounter domain - walls of both chiralities in the numerical simulations presented below .",
    "a simple geometric interpretation of the threshold is illustrated in the figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig2sub ] .",
    "as is illustrated in the phase - portraits ( see figures [ fig2]a and [ fig2]b ) , @xmath91 intersects @xmath90 for all positive @xmath12 , and therefore we will concentrate now on the case of negative @xmath12 .",
    "the central point is that for negative @xmath12 and negative @xmath58 , fp0 is a spiral when @xmath121 , and a saddle when @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , the motion of @xmath91 , for which @xmath123 , in the neighborhood of fp0 is spiral - like when @xmath121 ; this is not visible on the scale of fig . [ fig2 ]",
    "but can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2sub ] . as long as @xmath90 spirals around fp0",
    ", it has to intersect @xmath124 , which means that there is a hetero - clinic orbit and therefore a stationary domain - wall .",
    "when @xmath12 approaches @xmath15 , this spiraling motion becomes less prominent , and consequently , the intersection of @xmath90 and @xmath124 shifts to fp0 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2sub ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the position of the domain - wall shifts to large values of @xmath3 .",
    "when @xmath12 has crossed the critical value @xmath15 , fp0 is a saddle and it turns out that @xmath90 and @xmath124 only intersect in fp0 itself ( see figure [ fig2]d ) ; this corresponds to a domain - wall that is shifted to infinity .",
    "there are two different assumptions involved in the calculation of @xmath15 .",
    "first of all , @xmath58 needs to be small , in order for the perturbation equation ( [ balance ] ) to hold .",
    "secondly , we used for @xmath27 a step - function",
    ". we will now discuss the validity of @xmath15 when @xmath27 is of more general form .",
    "the latter assumption is , due to the scaling properties of equation ( [ balance ] ) , not crucial , as we have indicated above .",
    "when we rescale @xmath67 , with @xmath86 , we can compensate for this by rescaling the spatial coordinate ; effectively , the function @xmath27 becomes steeper then .",
    "when @xmath87 , @xmath27 becomes infinitely small and infinitely steep .",
    "therefore , the results that are obtained when @xmath58 is a step - function , are still valid when @xmath27 is an arbitrary monotonically decreasing function , provided that @xmath125 is small .",
    "it is tempting to try to extend the phase - space analysis to the non - perturbative case , i.e. , when @xmath58 and @xmath12 are not small .",
    "the stationary version of the coupled nld equations ( [ fk ] ) can then be written as a 4-dimensional dynamical system .",
    "the equations for the trajectories can not be solved in this case , but we can inspect the eigenvalues of the fixed points that correspond to the single - mode and bimodal states .",
    "the latter fixed point always has two positive and two negative eigenvalues .",
    "the fixed point corresponding to the single - mode state changed from a saddle to a spiral at @xmath126 in the perturbative case , and",
    "something similar happens in the 4-dimensional system .",
    "the eigenvalues of this fixed point are given by the expressions @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "one can readily find that , when @xmath129 , the fixed points changes from being a saddle ( two negative and two positive eigenvalues ) to a fixed point with one positive , one negative and two complex conjugated eigenvalues .",
    "although this does not prove that the stationary dw disappears , this is at least an indication that the previously obtained value @xmath130 may be also valid when @xmath58 and @xmath12 are not small .      to test the validity of the perturbation equation ( [ balance ] ) and to verify our predictions , we have performed numerical simulations of the coupled nld equations ( [ fk ] ) in a periodic system of size @xmath131 . because of the periodicity of the system , there are two domain - walls but we will , as before , focus attention on the domain - wall that connects a single - mode state @xmath132 to the left with a bimodal state to the right .",
    "the results reported here were obtained by using a pseudo - spectral code with the time step 0.05 and , typically , 256 modes ; runs with a higher number of modes up to 1024 were performed to check the results .",

    "therefore , we suspect the disordered motion of the domain - wall to be due to the convectively amplified discretization noise .",

    "the motion that occurs at @xmath170 is shown in fig .",

    "a close inspection of the data reveals that , to the left of the dw , where @xmath1 is very small , zeroes of the function @xmath44 are generated periodically .",
    "each of them is then convected and amplified , leading to the generation of a traveling kink .",
    "we have found that the frequency of the kink generation goes approximately linearly with @xmath12 , and that it is nonzero at @xmath179 .",
    "the velocity of the kinks is slightly smaller than the group - velocity .",

    ", the kink would travel with precisely the group - velocity of @xmath1 , but since the group - velocity of @xmath0 is opposite to that of @xmath1 , the small bump somewhat lowers the velocity of the kink .",
    "taking a smoother inhomogeneity ( @xmath180 ) suppresses the generation of kinks , and if they are still generated , this process is mixed with the irregular motion of the dw , as is shown in fig [ mix ] .",
    "the generation of kinks can even become irregular .    in conclusion ,",
    "when @xmath12 is beyond @xmath130 , the dynamical state may be represented by the disordered dw , regularly generated and traveling kinks , or a mixture between the two .",
    "in this section we relax the condition that the order parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 are real , and study the behavior of a dw in a system of two coupled rgl equations with the group - velocity terms :    [ rgl ] @xmath181    the main question here is to see whether the results obtained for the nld equations are relevant for the rgl equations .",
    "the complex order parameter poses the question of wavenumber selection , and the possibility of nonzero wavenumbers constitutes the main difference with the nld equations .",
    "we have found that , for the stationary states , the wavenumbers often , but not always , relax to zero when the initial conditions have nonzero wavenumbers .",
    "when the wavenumbers of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are constant and equal , the nld equations can be used to describe the stationary states ; when the wavenumbers are more general , modified nld equations model the stationary domain - walls , as we will discuss below . in the dynamical regime ,",
    "small wavenumbers may be generated starting from initial conditions with zero wavenumbers .",
    "note that the usual eckhaus band of stable wavenumbers for a single rgl equation @xcite will be affected by the coupling between the two rgl equations .",
    "in particular , since for @xmath182 both the single - modes and the bimodal states with zero wavenumber are only marginally stable , one may expect that the size of the band of stable wavenumbers is directly related to @xmath58 ; and that for @xmath182 the band of stable wavenumbers closes .",
    "we have not pursued this question further .",
    "the wavenumbers of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which we refer to as @xmath183 and @xmath184 , also have an influence on the stability borders of the single and bimodal states .",
    "when @xmath185 , the crossover between single and bimodal states occurs at @xmath186 , just as when @xmath187 .",
    "this can be shown by substituting plane - wave solutions with equal wavenumbers in the rgl equations and performing a rescaling of @xmath3 , @xmath188 and the amplitudes , similar to the rescaling that is used to scale out the growth - rate @xmath189 .",
    "apart from this scale transformation , the equations for zero wavenumber and equal wavenumber are equivalent .",
    "when @xmath190 , the stability borders for both the homogeneous single - mode and bimodal states shift away from @xmath186 , and in particular there exists a tiny parameter regime @xmath191 , for which both the single - mode and bimodal states are linearly unstable .",

    "we focus on the case @xmath135 and explore numerically the mechanisms by which the wavenumber relaxes .",
    "the values of @xmath14 that we found are very close to those found in the simulations of the nld equations ( we will come back to this below ) .    the simulations of eqs .",

    "( [ initialcon ] ) , but the wavenumbers @xmath183 and @xmath184 of the complex variables @xmath43 and @xmath44 in the initial states were allowed to be nonzero but constant , to study the wavenumber relaxation .    in the variational case @xmath195 the system ( [ rglsys ] )",
    "has a lyaponav functional @xmath18 with a minimum at @xmath187 .",
    "however , such states can not always be reached , since the periodic boundary conditions lead to conservation of the total phase difference across the system , as long as the amplitude remains nonzero .",
    "so , the wavenumber of the , e.g. , mode @xmath43 can be relaxed through the so - called phase - slips occuring at the points where @xmath196 vanishes @xcite .",

    "we found that , the wavenumber of the @xmath1 mode always relaxes to zero , while for the @xmath0 mode , the wavenumber occasionally remains nonzero .",
    "the @xmath1 mode is close to zero in the single - mode region .",

    "the wavenumber is advected to the single - mode region , where it relaxes .",
    "when the initial @xmath184 is large , the phase slips of @xmath1 occasionally occur in the double - mode region , but only as a transient .    for the @xmath0 mode ,",

    "finally , the nonlinear dispersion can become so large that also the bimodal state becomes periodic .",
    "the disorder seen in fig .",
    "[ cglfig1]c may be either a transient behavior or an established state ; our simulations were not conclusive , and we leave this for further work . here",
    "the coefficients of the cgl equations are such , that homogenous phase - winding solutions are unstable , and that even in homogeneous systems , i.e. , for @xmath58 fixed at @xmath240 , periodic states arise .",
    "the domain - wall here is disordered , and so this state shows the competition between linearly stable periodic states and a disordered domain - wall .    the linear dispersion has a damping effect on the dynamics as for @xmath241 similar behavior",
    "is observed for slightly higher values of the nonlinear dispersion .",
    "a nonzero group - velocity has a more complicated effect on the dynamics , as it breaks the reflection symmetry .",
    "the oscillations that occur for small nonlinear dispersion are damped , because the group - velocity terms advect the local wavenumbers away from the dw , and therefore they suppress the aforementioned feedback effect .",
    "for instance , for @xmath242 and @xmath243 , we have observed stationary states up to @xmath244 . on the other hand , the symmetry breaking can have a destabilizing effect on the dynamics : the periodic state shown in fig .",
    "[ cglfig1]b becomes disordered when @xmath12 is nonzero .",
    "when we move away from the line @xmath222 , we find that spatio - temporal chaos occurs quite easily .",
    "we have focused on the case @xmath245 . for @xmath246 , a periodic state similar to the one depicted in figure",
    "[ cglfig1]b occurs .",
    "when @xmath218 is increased , both the periodic and the bimodal states become gradually disordered ( figs . [ cglfig3]a and [ cglfig3]b ) .    when @xmath200 , the chaotic state consists of more or less stationary , irregularly growing and decaying pulses , but when @xmath197 , this quasi - stationary character is destroyed .",
    "we have checked that in the disordered regime , two slightly different initial conditions diverge throughout the whole domain , which shows that these states are an example of spatio - temporal chaos .",
    "note that this occurs for values of @xmath217 and @xmath218 for which the homogeneous single and bimodal state are linearly stable .",
    "apparently the dw acts as a `` seed '' for the disorder , that then spreads out and completely destroys the plain - wave state .",
    "we have concentrated here on the case @xmath222 , although it should be stressed that when @xmath219 is not exactly @xmath247 , we observed similar behavior .",
    "the choice @xmath222 merely serves to limit ourselves in exploring the parameter - space .",
    "in this paper we have considered domain walls between single - mode and bimodal states for three types of coupled equations with a spatially dependent coupling coefficient . in the simplest case of two",
    "coupled nld equations with the group - velocity terms , we were able to reduce the description of stationary configurations to a single non - autonomous second - order ordinary differential equation , that was used to determine analytically a necessary condition for the existence of a stationary dw in terms of the group - velocity .",
    "we have found that our prediction for the destabilization of such a stationary dw is in good agreement with numerical simulations , and we have found chaotically oscillating dw s in the case when the group - velocity is beyond the corresponding threshold . for two coupled rgl equations we have found a similar scenario . finally , for the coupled cgl equations",
    ", we have found that , in most cases , the dw s are unstable , even when the group - velocity is zero , and spatio - temporal disordered states often occur in this model .    in the future",
    ", it would be interesting to investigate the competition between the various states of the coupled cgl equations .",
    "in particular , not much is known about the periodic states that seem to play an important role here .",
    "possible research subjects include the development of analytical solutions , the development of counting arguments @xcite and the competition between periodic and phase - winding solutions .",
    "the effect of an inhomogeneity as studied in this chapter on the various states may be a valuable tool in probing the states that occur for constant @xmath20 .",
    "the effect of nonzero group - velocity on the domain - walls in the cgl equations is poorly understood ; it would be interesting to see whether the divergence and subsequent instability of the domain - wall , as observed for the nld equations and cgl equations , still has some relevance for the cgl equations when @xmath219 and @xmath218 are sufficiently different .",
    "we appreciate useful discussions with wim van saarloos , willem van de water and bert peletier ."
