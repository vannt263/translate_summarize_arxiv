    "if baryons couple only with @xmath2-mesons ( @xmath2 case ) , krein , nielsen , puff and wilets [ 1 ] found that in the relativistic self - consistent hartree - fock ( rschf ) [ 2 , 3 ] calculation of the renormalized baryon propagator , its spectral function @xmath3 can be negative for some real values of @xmath4 .",
    "they emphasized that this result is unacceptable .",
    "the spectral representation they considered is of the form @xmath5 since @xmath3 represents the probability that a state of mass latexmath:[$%    might be due to the inadequacy of the hf approximation or the inconsistency of the theory .",
    "the @xmath2-meson propagator can be written as [ 4 , 5 ] @xmath7 @xmath8^{-1 } ,   \\tag{1b}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the mass counterterm for the @xmath2-meson . in their calculation",
    "they have neglected all the terms proportional to @xmath0 in the @xmath2-meson propagator on the basis of the baryon current conservation implied by the model for a rigorous calculation .",
    "though this is a generally accepted approximation [ 6 ] and indeed , such terms need not be taken into account if the baryon current conserves [ 7 ] , their contribution in the rschf approximation is not zero and has to be studied [ 8 ] .",
    "it also indicates that the rschf approximation does not preserve the baryon current conservation .    in ref .",
    "[ 8 ] we showed that the negative baryon spectral function mentioned above is caused by the @xmath0 terms in the @xmath2-meson propagator . in eq .",
    "( 1a ) the last longitudinal term is not renormalizable , thus if the @xmath0 terms should be considered , it must be studied carefully . in order to take a proper account of the contribution of the @xmath10 terms in @xmath11 a rule has also been proposed in [ 8 ] . refs .",
    "[ 9 , 12 ] have shown if in addition to the @xmath2-meson , other mesons like @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and chiral @xmath14 are considered , the baryon spectral functions in the rschf approximation can be regular for parameters of physical interest , even though the @xmath0 terms in eq .",
    "( 1a ) are neglected .",
    "clearly this does not mean that the contribution of the @xmath10 terms is not important when the baryon current conservation is violated , because it is related with the relative strength between different fields .",
    "for example , in the @xmath1 model , if we adjust the coupling constants @xmath15 and @xmath16 , one finds that along with @xmath17 becoming smaller the undesirable negative spectral function will appear again .",
    "so , it is desirable to assess the effect of @xmath0 terms , even in cases where there are other mesons .",
    "the role of the @xmath0 terms in the vector meson propagator has been studied in ref . [ 6 ] .",
    "it was found that under the @xmath18 approximation the effect of the @xmath0 terms on the observable quantities is negligible . in this paper",
    "we would like to consider the other case where the baryon propagator incorporates the propagation of virtual baryons and antibaryons .",
    "we shall study the contribution of the @xmath19 terms to the baryon and meson spectral functions and their influence on the effects of self - consistency by means of the rule suggested in ref . [ 8 ] .",
    "we find that in the @xmath1 model the regularity of the effects of self - consistency is almost the same as found in ref .",
    "[ 9 ] , and the contribution of the @xmath0 terms to the meson spectral function is not very important .",
    "however , there is a marked change in the baryon spectral function which becomes more peaked .",
    "moreover , we can not remove such a change by a proper readjustment of parameters .",
    "this shows that violation of the current conservation law may cause quite significant effects .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we shall consider the coupled set of dyson - schwinger ( ds ) equations for the renormalized hadron propagators in the @xmath1 model .",
    "the numerical results are given and discussed in section 3 .",
    "a summary is presented in section 4 .",

    "we shall use the same notation as refs . [ 8 , 9 ] .",

    "use the on - shell renormalization condition on baryon and the intermediate renormalization condition on mesons , which can be written as [ 9 ] : @xmath76 @xmath77 where @xmath78 , or @xmath79 .",
    "in addition , we shall also use ( @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) and @xmath82 to denote the baryon and meson spectral weight functions , respectively .",

    "( 7 ) ) , we can obtain the expressions of the self - energy and the spectral weight functions .",

    "( 2 - 6 , 8 , 9 ) and their explicit expressions yield the closed set of the renormalized ds equations used for our calculation .",
    "we shall use the following values for the coupling constants and masses : @xmath91 the notation is the same as in refs .",
    "[ 8 , 9 ] .",
    "now , we consider the @xmath1 model in case ii , where the additional contribution of the @xmath0-terms in eq .",
    "( 1a ) is taken into account . following the method and rule obtained in [ 8 ]",
    ", we solve the coupled set of ds equations by the method of iteration .",
    "the numerical results are shown in figs . 2 - 4 .",
    "in our calculation , we have studied three different schemes : schemes p , ep and fsc .",
    "the baryon spectral functions obtained from these three schemes are very close to each other .",
    "though the self - consistency makes the peak of the resonance higher , as a whole its effect is not significant , just as found in case i [ 9 ] .",
    "however , comparing fig .",
    "2 with fig . 8 in [ 9 ] , one observes there is a great quantitative change in the functional behavior .",
    "the maxima of @xmath92 and @xmath81 become more distinct and sharper in case ii .",
    "let us designate @xmath93 as region i ( ii ) .",
    "we note @xmath94 and @xmath95 are real in region i and become complex in region ii , so in region ii their imaginary parts will also contribute .",
    "let us fix @xmath96 and consider , for instance , the variation of @xmath92 with @xmath97 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . when @xmath97 is small , there are two resonances which are located in region i and ii , respectively .",
    "( 8a ) can be rewriten as @xmath98 $ ] , where the subscript r and i denote the real and imaginary parts of @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively .",
    "comparing with ( @xmath101 , @xmath95 ) , the values of ( @xmath102 , @xmath103 ) is very small , and in region i the contribution of ( @xmath101 , @xmath95 ) to the denominator of @xmath92 is larger than to the numerator which is mainly determined by the imaginary part of ( @xmath102 , @xmath104 ) , so the resonance is small . if @xmath97 tends to zero , the resonance in region ii becomes more and more like the resonance of @xmath92 in the @xmath2 case and the resonance in region i disappears ( see [ 8 ] ) .",
    "as @xmath97 becomes larger , @xmath105 and @xmath103 are big . in this case",
    "the combined contributions of ( @xmath102 , @xmath103 ) and ( @xmath101 , @xmath95 ) to the denominator and numerator of @xmath92 are comparable in region i , thus the resonance becomes sharper . in region",
    "ii along with @xmath106 becoming larger @xmath107 is big , so @xmath92 becomes small and the resonance in this region almost disappears , just as shown in fig .",
    "2 .    for both cases",
    "i and ii , we have readjusted the parameters under the condition that the spectral function @xmath108 should be non - negative .",
    "we find that for the parameters of physical interest the resonance is always in region ii for case i , while the stronger one is in region i for case ii .",
    "moreover , the resonance in case ii is more distinct than that in case i. our results show the difference between these two cases will remain even by the readjustment of the parameters .",
    "thus , the contribution of @xmath0-term is very important to the baryon spectral functions .",
    "since @xmath92 relates directly to the probability of occurrence of an excited baryon state , the contribution of @xmath0-term in the @xmath2-meson propagator seems to make the possibility of forming a resonance baryon state greater .    from fig .",
    "4 , it looks that the effect of self - consistency on mesons is discernible .",
    "however , there is no need to require self - consistency in the meson propagators , because in figs . 2 and 4 the results of scheme ep  and fsc are almost the same .",
    "compared with fig . 10 in [ 9 ]",
    "the self - consistent meson spectral function is larger , but this change is not great .",
    "it means the contribution of @xmath0-terms to ( @xmath109 , @xmath110 ) is not important .    from fig .",
    "2 , fig . 3 in [ 9 ] and fig . 2b in [ 8 ] , one notes that there also exists a cancellation between the effects on the self - consistency due to the @xmath13 and @xmath2 mesons in case ii .    in order to study the effect of self - consistency more carefully ,",
    "we have drawn @xmath92 and @xmath81 calculated for an intermediate @xmath111 in fig .",
    "one observes that the effect of self - consistency is not significant , except for the region of the peaks , where it makes the peak value a little higher . on the whole",
    ", we may say that similarly to case i , the effects of self - consistency in case ii are also not important .    for the neutron matter the result",
    "are almost the same as above .",
    "in this paper the coupled set of ds equations in the @xmath1 for two cases were solved self - consistently .",
    "the calculations show that in the @xmath112 model , there is no need to require self - consistency in meson propagators and the self - consistency almost has no effect on the baryon propagator .",
    "compared with case i , there is a distinct change in case ii in the baryon spectral functions which become more peaked .",
    "such a change can not be removed even by a proper readjustment of parameters .",
    "moreover , there also exists a cancellation between the effects of the self - consistency due to the @xmath13 and @xmath2 mesons .",
    "our results show that in a calculation where the law of the baryon current ( bc ) conservation is violated , the contribution of the @xmath0terms is generally not negligible and may serve as a sign signifying the degree of its violence .",
    "if we assume the approximation made for the calculation is appropriate , though bc may not be conserved , then the @xmath0 terms have to be considered ( way-@xmath0 ) .",
    "clearly whether the results obtained by way-@xmath0 are acceptable has still to be confirmed by a more rigorous calculation where the laws incorporated in the model are respected .",
    "since a bare baryon - meson vertex is used , the rschf approximation does not satisfy the ward - takahashi ( w - t ) identity .",
    "it has been pointed out in ref . [ 6 ] that this is the main reason why the bc conservation is violated .",
    "thus , if vertices consistent with the w - t identity are used ( way - wt ) , the @xmath0 terms may be neglected .",
    "sofar no numerical calculations along this line have been reported .",
    "however , we do agree with ref . [ 2 ] that this is a procedure worthy of pursuing , as it will also tell whether and when the simpler way-@xmath0 or some other simple approximation may be a good substitute for way - wt , because the latter is quite complicated except for some simple cases .",
