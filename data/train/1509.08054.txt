    "prior to the alkali fusion steps , an isotope @xmath86pu marker and a chemical @xmath87th marker were added to the sediment .",
    "@xmath86pu was used to monitor the efficiency of pu detection by measuring the @xmath86pu content of the final ams sample ( analogous to the @xmath36pu spike in the crust samples ) while @xmath87th served as additional indicator of the chemical efficiency of actinide extraction by measuring the alpha activity of an electroplated deposition prepared from a separate fraction .",

    "@xmath35pu measurements were performed relative to the @xmath36pu ( @xmath86pu ) spike , i.e. the total efficiency and the chemical yield of pu ( when compared to the theoretical measurement efficiency ) was monitored with the @xmath36pu ( @xmath86pu ) spike , that was counted in short time intervals before and after the @xmath1pu runs in the ams measurements .",
    "the chemical yield was varying between 5% and 70% largely depending on the sample matrix .    in a sputter source the fe / ag matrix , containing the pu atoms , was bombarded with cs ions and negative puo ions were extracted , energy and mass analysed before injection into the tandem accelerator .",
    "the negative ions were accelerated to the 3-mv tandem terminal and stripped there to positive ions in the gas stripper ( o@xmath82 ) .",
    "@xmath1pu@xmath40-ions were accelerated to a final energy of 18 mev and selected with a second analyzing magnet .",
    "they then had to pass an additional energy and another mass filter ( electrostatic and magnetic dipoles respectively ) and were finally counted in an energy - sensitive particle detector .",
    "the system was optimized with a @xmath7u pilot beam and monitored during a measurement with reference samples containing @xmath86pu .",
    "the measurement setup for @xmath1pu and @xmath36pu counting was scaled from the tuning setup . at the end of a measurement series ,",
    "reference samples containing a well - known isotope ratio of @xmath1pu/@xmath86pu were measured .",
    "the measured ratios reproduced the nominal values within 4% and confirmed the validity of scaling between the different masses in the measurement .",
    "this setup suppresses adjacent masses ( e.g. @xmath7u from @xmath35pu ) by 8 to 9 orders of magnitude .",
    "this suppression factor was sufficient for @xmath1pu counting as no interference from neighbouring masses is expected for @xmath1pu ( and additional isotopic suppression , e.g. via time - of - flight identification , would have been at the cost of lower particle transmission ) .",
    "however , @xmath7u was abundant at levels of @xmath810 ppm in the crust and u separation from pu in the chemical preparation of these samples was not 100% .",
    "thus , the detector events registered for @xmath35pu counting , lower by two to three orders of magnitude compared to modern samples , are attributed to leaking @xmath7u atoms injected as @xmath7uoh@xmath88 ions together with @xmath35puo@xmath88 , thus mimicking @xmath35pu . to summarize , our detector event rate for @xmath35pu suggests no significant anthropogenic @xmath1pu contamination .",
    "the measurement procedure was a sequence of alternating counting periods of @xmath36pu , @xmath35pu , @xmath1pu and again @xmath36pu .",
    "all samples were repeatedly measured until they were completely exhausted .",
    "the sputtering time per sample was between 5 and 20 hours .",
    "three measurement series were required to fully consume all the samples .",
    "the overall yields for the 12 crust samples were between 0.06@xmath210@xmath67 and 1.54@xmath210@xmath67 ; i.e. one @xmath1pu detector event would represent correspondingly between 6500 and 1.7 @xmath210@xmath89 @xmath1pu atoms in the analysed sample .",
    "a similar procedure was followed for the sediment samples where @xmath86pu was used as a spike .    due to the low number of expected detector events , the machine and measurement background was carefully monitored with samples of pure fe and ag powder .",
    "they were sputtered identical to the samples containing the crust fractions . in addition , one crust sample ( x ) , the lowest layer of the crust material , was of hydrothermal origin where no extraterrestrial @xmath1pu could accumulate .",
    "this sample was chemically prepared and measured in the same way as the other crust samples and served as a process blank for potential chemistry and machine background .",
    "the incorporation efficiency of bomb - produced pu into the crust was determined from the anthropogenic @xmath35pu content in the top layer of the crust and deep - sea sediment data ( details are given in table 3 ) .",
    "the average over 18 sediment cores from the pacific measured between 1974 and 1979 gave a @xmath18pu sediment inventory of 2.15 bq m@xmath73 @xcite .",
    "when compared to the well - known surface activity of 2.8 mci km@xmath73 ( 10@xmath69 bq m@xmath73 ) @xcite , at the time of sampling the crust in 1976 , 2.1% of anthropogenic pu from the bomb - tests was incorporated into deep - sea sediments with sediments having an incorporation efficiency of 100% ( this compares well with the ratio of the time that had passed since the peak in atmospheric bomb - testing ( 15 y ) and the mean residence time of pu in the ocean of @xmath8440 y ; i.e. 3.4% ) .    taking the total anthropogenic pu - inventory at the location of the crust ( between 60 and 78 bq m@xmath73 and a @xmath90pu/@xmath35pu atom - ratio of 0.20 ) @xcite and the fraction of 2.1% measured in sediments ,",
