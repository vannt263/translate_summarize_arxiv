    "the formation of outflows from young stellar objects ( yso s ) has been a subject of interest for some time ( see summaries by * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "these outflows tend to consist of a highly collimated `` jet '' and a poorly collimated outflow , often referred to as the `` disk wind '' @xcite .",
    "jets have outflow velocities of @xmath0 to 500 km s@xmath1 and may , in some cases , exhibit spectral characteristics of a hot plasma cooling down @xcite .",
    "the disk wind component of the outflow typically has directionally averaged speeds of 0  50 km s@xmath1 @xcite and has spectral characteristics of a cooler plasma .",
    "some systems contain a zero velocity component , which may be due to an oblique shock interaction between the disk wind and the disk .",
    "as observational techniques and capabilities have improved , new insights have been gained concerning the outflow properties very close to the star .",
    "for example , jet collimation can occur very close to the source star - disk system .",
    "observations of dg tauri using solf s method @xcite place the collimation region within 30  40 au , which is the resolution of the observations of @xcite .",
    "recent measurements by @xcite of the spatial distribution of the line emission for the h@xmath2 , [ n ii ] 6583 , [ o i ] 6363 , and [ s ii ] 6731 lines , at different distances from dg tauri , imply an even closer collimation distance for this system of 14 au .",
    "also , hubble space telescope observations of the hh 30 system @xcite imply that the jet must be fully collimated within 30 au . for a general discussion of the collimation of yso jets , see @xcite .",
    "observations of hh 30 also imply that the jet formation mechanism is episodic , producing outbursts ( or `` knots '' along the jet axis ) every @xmath3 years @xcite .",
    "a probably related result is the observation of dg tau by @xcite , who showed that the complicated [ o i ] 6300 line profile from the immediate environment of dg tau changes drastically within 1 year .",
    "larger scale observations of other systems such as hh 111 imply a knot ejection timescale of @xmath4 years @xcite , but there is no consensus as to whether or not the timescales of hh 30 and hh 111 are due to the same physical principle .",
    "one result of so many recent observational insights is that significant progress has been made in understanding the mechanism which generates yso outflows .",
    "while hydrodynamic means have been investigated ( e.g. , a stellar wind which is collimated via shock focusing ; see , e.g. , the early paper by @xcite ) , the models that have met the most success have relied on magnetic fields to launch and collimate the outflow .",
    "these models fall into two categories : those that rely solely on a magnetic field which threads the disk to centrifugally fling the wind ( and eventually collimate into a jet ; ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ) , and those that depend on the interaction between the stellar magnetic field and the accretion disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the model of (",
    "* henceforth gwb ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth gbw ) , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth gw ) , a stellar dipole field couples the star to the disk , differential rotation between the star and the disk rapidly inflates the magnetic field via helicity injection , and an outflow burst is produced with both jet and disk wind properties .",
    "magnetic reconnection allows the process to repeat .",
    "@xcite and gwb identified this basic mechanism within a few stellar radii , and gbw illustrated the resulting outflow out to several au with a magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulation in a single case study .",
    "gw laid out some of the physics driving key characteristics of the outflow and star - disk interaction , allowing some predictions to be made beyond their case study .",
    "the work presented in gbw and gw implied that the interaction between the stellar magnetosphere and the innermost regions of the accretion disk could produce an outflow that is qualitatively similar to those observed .",
    "the outflow consists of a knotty jet ( collimated within 1 au ) that is morphologically similar to the observations of hh 30 @xcite .",
    "however , the size scale is an order of magnitude smaller than hh 30 , and the timescale for knot formation is an order of magnitude shorter .",
    "in addition to the apparent mismatch between observation and simulation results , issues that must be addressed are :    1 .",
    "the dipole field from the star initially threads the disk everywhere .",
    "thus , it is not clear if the outflow is a result of the interaction between the star and the disk ( as claimed in gw ) , or if it is due to the magnetic field which threads the disk everywhere at @xmath5 = 0 . 2 .",
    "the results of gbw represent a single case study .",
    "the sensitivity of the jet formation mechanism to key attributes of the star - disk system was not directly established .    to address these issues , we repeated the basic simulation of gbw for various disk densities , stellar magnetic field strengths , and magnetic field configurations .",
    "section [ simresults ] contains the details of the parametric cases and of the outflows that result in each case .",
    "the parametric simulations also allow us to evaluate the disk oscillation model of gw in  [ evaluation ] .",
    "a semi - analytical approach , including a formulation of the extraction of angular momentum from the disk , leads to a modification and enables testing of the modified model .",
    "a summary and discussion follows , in  [ discussion ] .",
    "we used the 2.5-d ( axisymmetric ) mhd simulation code employed by gwb , gbw , and gw to examine , parametrically , the effect of varying the accretion disk density , the stellar dipole field strength , and the initial magnetic field configuration .",
    "the simulation code employs a two - step lax - wendroff ( finite difference ) scheme @xcite to simultaneously solve the following time - dependent , mhd equations : @xmath6      -\\left[{{gm_*\\rho}\\over       { ( \\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}^2+\\mbox{\\boldmath $ z$}^2 ) } }      \\hat{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}}\\right]\\cdot\\mbox{\\boldmath $ v$ }      + \\mbox{\\boldmath $ j$ } \\cdot \\mbox{\\boldmath $ e$ } \\label{eng_eq}\\\\ { { \\partial\\mbox{\\boldmath $ b$}}\\over\\partial t } & = &       -{\\rm c}(\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\nabla$}\\times\\mbox{\\boldmath $ e$})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and uses @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the density , the velocity , @xmath9 the scalar gas pressure , @xmath10 the internal energy density , the magnetic field , the volume current , the electric field , c the speed of light , and @xmath11 the ratio of specific heats ( we used @xmath11 = 5/3 in our simulations ) . in the momentum and energy equations ( [ mom_eq ] and [ eng_eq ] )",
    ", we include a source term for gravity in which @xmath12 is the gravitational constant , @xmath13 is the stellar mass , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the usual cylindrical coordinates , and @xmath16 is the spherical distance from the center of the star ( @xmath17 allows us to explicitly model the ohmic diffusion of the magnetic field by specifying the value of the resistivity , @xmath18 . as discussed by gw ,",
    "the numerical diffusivity intrinsic to the simulations is measured to be @xmath19 @xmath20 s@xmath1 . in order to properly capture the physics of magnetic diffusion",
    ", we use @xmath21 @xmath20 s@xmath1 in all of our simulations .",
    "we use a `` nested box '' scheme , and for the work presented here , all simulations used 5 nested boxes , each with half the resolution ( and so twice the physical size ) as the one interior to it .",
    "each box consists of a 401 @xmath22 100 ( in the cylindrical @xmath23 and @xmath24 direction , respectively ) grid . as in gbw and gw , the grid spacing is 0.1 @xmath25 in the innermost box , but the outermost box dimensions are 3.2 au by 0.8 au . the innermost ( in @xmath16 ) boundary consists of a 15 gridpoint sphere ( the `` surface of the star '' ) , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are held fixed at the initial values .",
    "we enforce reflection symmetry across the equatorial plane . along the rotation axis , we require that @xmath28 , and all other quantities are equal to the value at @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 is the grid spacing ) .",
    "we adopt outflow conditions ( the spatial derivative across the boundary is zero for all quantities ) at the outermost boundary of the outermost box .",
    "the initial conditions for the baseline case of this study is parametrically identical to the case illustrated by gbw .",
    "they describe the initial conditions for this case in considerable detail ( see their table 1 ) , which includes a disk similar to a classic @xmath2 model accretion disk @xcite with @xmath31 = 10@xmath32 @xmath33 yr@xmath1 and @xmath2 = 0.2 ( @xmath34)@xmath35 ( where @xmath34 is the usual cylindrical coordinate in units of au ) . the stellar magnetic field is dipolar , with a field strength of 1800 g at the pole of the 1 @xmath36 , 1.5 @xmath37 central star .",
    "initially , the stellar corona is in hydrostatic equilibrium , and the density falls of as @xmath38 .",
    "the star rotates with a period of 1.8 days ( which is fairly close to the shortest observed rotation period of ctts ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and the disk is initially truncated at 8.5 @xmath37 and has a midplane density of @xmath39 g @xmath40 at 10 @xmath37 .",
    "the dipole field threads the disk everywhere at the start of the simulation .    to save computational time",
    ", this work focuses more on the outflow generation mechanism and the integrated outflow properties instead of the larger scale outflow morphology .",
    "the simulation cases were all carried out for a period of at least 160 days of real time ( requiring 30 - 60 days of computing time per case ) .",
    "table [ summarytab ] serves as a quick reference for all simulation cases in this study .",
    "the three cases which examine variations of initial disk density are the `` low density , '' `` baseline , '' and `` high density '' cases .",
    "the three which examine variations of stellar field strength are the `` weak field , '' `` baseline , '' and `` strong field '' cases .",
    "the relative factors by which the disk density and the magnetic field strength were varied were chosen based on energy balance .",
    "this is because the importance of the magnetic field is measured by the ratio of the magnetic energy to the kinetic energy in the disk .",
    "since the disk kinetic energy is proportional to the disk density , and the magnetic energy scales as the square of the stellar field strength , we varied the initial disk density by factors of 4 and the initial magnetic field strength by factors of 2 .",
    "we also investigated simulations with a `` primordial , '' vertical magnetic field in the disk . so that the stellar magnetosphere was truncated ( at the region of disk and stellar field equality ) near the star , the simulations use stellar dipole strength equal to the weak field case , plus a vertical field of 0.07 gauss everywhere in the simulation region .",
    "these parameters give a stellar magnetosphere that is truncated at 29 @xmath37 in the equatorial plane .",
    "the stellar magnetosphere has an open or closed topology , depending on the polarity of the primordial field .",
    "the vertical field in these simulations cases is relatively weak ( in that the stellar dipole is dominant for an extended region ; the ratio of magnetic to kinetic energy near the disk inner edge is @xmath41 ) but is sufficient to assess the effect of the dipole field that initially threads the disk at all radii in the other cases . in order to initially exclude the disk from the stellar magnetosphere , we truncated the disk at 29 @xmath37 for these models",
    ". therefore , our models with various magnetic field topologies comprise three cases : one with a downward - directed ( @xmath42 ) vertical field ( `` closed magnetosphere '' ) , one without a vertical field ( `` truncated disk '' ) , and one with an upward - directed field ( `` open magnetosphere '' ) .",
    "all three have a stellar dipole field with the same strength as the weak field case , and all have a disk truncation radius at 29 @xmath37 ( which is 3.4 times further out than all the other simulations ) .",
    "figures [ jetdensfig ]  [ jetgeomfig ] illustrate the general outflow morphology for all cases . in these figures ,",
    "the density grayscale ( logarithmic ) and poloidal velocity vectors represent data in the outermost box for a single `` snapshot '' in time .",
    "data from the inner 100 @xmath22 100 grid points of the outer box are shown , reflected about the rotation axis to better show the jet .",
    "the grayscale emphasizes material in the outflow , but does not capture the relatively high density distribution near the star and disk inner edge . for a detailed look at the complex and time - dependent density distribution near the star",
    ", see figures 3 and 4 of gbw . note that different times are represented for each case .",
    "this is because the launching mechanism is essentially periodic , with the period being different for each case .",
    "the innermost regions of the disk oscillate radially , and each oscillation triggers a large scale reconnection event which alters the shape of the outflow in a periodic way . for the purpose of comparison , we show the various cases at a similar phase ( but not at the same time ) of their outflow .    as evident in figure [ jetdensfig ] , disk density variations of a factor of 16 have no major effect on the outflow morphology .",
    "the basic outflow , in all cases , consists of a wide angle component ( the `` disk wind '' ) and a jet . also note that even at this close - in scale ( on the order of an au ) , the general characteristics of both the jets and disk winds are similar  knots in the jet are apparent in each case ( most clearly in the high - density case ) , as are the `` wispy '' structures between the disk and jet ( associated with magnetic reconnection ; see gbw ) .    while the general morphologies are remarkably similar , some differences between the outflows in figure [ jetdensfig ] are apparent .",
    "the low density case has a higher outflow speed , a lower outflow density , and a larger spacing between knots in the jet that the other cases .",
    "conversely , the high density disk case has a higher density , slower outflow , and the spacing between the knots in the jet is reduced considerably .",
    "this reduction in knot formation period is related to a reduction in the period of radial disk oscillations ( discussed further in  [ evaluation ] ) .",
    "figure [ jetfieldfig ] represents the simulation cases which examined variations in stellar magnetic field strength .",
    "again , the morphologies of all runs are similar , indicating that variations of a factor of 4 in magnetic field strength produce no significant variation in large scale morphology .",
    "each outflow produces a knotty jet with a disk wind and a wispy structure in the region between the disk and jet .",
    "however , differences between the outflows in figure [ jetfieldfig ] are evident .",
    "the outflow is slower in the weak field case and faster in the strong field case . also , the structure of the disk wind in the weak field case has a more complicated appearance than the other two cases .",
    "figure [ jetgeomfig ] illustrates the outflows for the cases with different large scale magnetic field topologies .",
    "insets in each of the three panels show the topology in the initial conditions . once again ,",
    "note that the general morphologies of the outflow are all similar .",
    "recalling from table [ summarytab ] that these three topologies are variants of the weak field case , it is interesting to note that all of these cases exhibit the same general characteristics of the weak field case ( fig .",
    "[ jetfieldfig ] ) .",
    "all produce outflows with jets and disk winds ( including wispy structures ) with velocities similar to the weak field case , and all three cases in figure [ jetgeomfig ] produce outflows with a complicated structure ( relative to the other cases ) on the one au scale .",
    "this figure is particularly noteworthy because , in the bottom two panels , the disk is threaded everywhere by a vertical field , so it has much more magnetic energy in the disk ( at large radii ) than the cases with only a stellar dipole .",
    "the fact that the outflows in these cases are not significantly different from the top panel , supports the underlying premise of the model : it is the interaction between the stellar magnetosphere and the surrounding accretion disk that produces the outflow , and the effect of the dipole field lines initially threading the disk at large radii is insignificant .",
    "the primary conclusion to be drawn from figures [ jetdensfig ] - [ jetgeomfig ] is that the outflow formation mechanism is robust .",
    "also , to the extent these parameters were varied , the jet morphology produced by this mechanism is independent of the density of the accretion disk , the strength of the stellar magnetic field , and the large scale magnetic field topology . as seen in these figures , however",
    ", the magnitude and timescales of outflow characteristics do depend on the magnetic field strength and the density of the accretion disk , and the remainder of this paper addresses these dependencies in a quantitative way .",
    "figure [ maxvelfig ] shows the variation in radial outflow velocities for all cases . for the data in this figure we first calculated the radial velocity ( @xmath43 ) on a sphere with a radius of 0.67 au ( 90 grid points in the outer box ) centered on the star . due to the periodic nature of the system , and",
    "because we were most interested in the global outflow properties , we used a time average value . since it takes a while for the outflow to clear out the entire simulation region , our average only includes data from the interval of 50  160 days .",
    "we thus obtain the average velocity as a function of angle from the pole .",
    "the data in figure [ maxvelfig ] represent the maximum of the time - averaged velocity , which occurred at @xmath44 degrees for all cases .",
    "the leftmost panel shows the velocities as a function of the disk variation , the middle as a function of the initial magnetic field energy , and the right panel as a function of the vertical field strength .",
    "note that the entire range of velocities ( 100 to 200 km s@xmath1 ) is well within the range of observed outflow velocities ( 50 to 500 km s@xmath1 ) and corresponds to the velocities in most of the observed hh objects ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in panel",
    "a ) , the radial outflow velocity decreases with increasing disk density , while in b ) , the outflow velocity increases with increasing magnetic field energy .",
    "finally , panel c ) shows that the outflow velocity is roughly independent of the large - scale magnetic field topology .",
    "it is important to note that the velocities in panel c ) are similar to the weak field case .",
    "remember that the simulations represented in c ) have their disk initially truncated 3.3 times further out than the weak field case , and two of them have an additional vertical `` primordial '' field .",
    "we see from panel b ) that the outflow velocity depends on the magnetic energy ( from the stellar dipole ) ,",
    "so the fact that panel c ) shows essentially no trend suggests that it is only the magnetic energy in the stellar magnetosphere that is important for accelerating the outflow .",
    "the data in panels a ) and b ) can be fit with a power law ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively , where @xmath47 is the initial disk density and @xmath48 is the initial magnetic energy associated with the stellar dipole field ) .",
    "a least squares minimization fit gives @xmath49 = @xmath50 and 0.3 for panel a ) and b ) , respectively .",
    "we note that there is not necessarily a physical justification for fitting all of the data with a power law , but we will use it to quantify the dependence of various system properties on the parameters we varied .",
    "figure [ mdotfig ] shows the variation in mass outflow rates , @xmath51 , for the three parametric studies . to obtain these points ( and the ones for @xmath52 and @xmath53 , discussed below )",
    ", we first calculated the mass flux ( also energy flux and angular momentum flux ) through a sphere at 0.67 au .",
    "the mass outflow rate ( also @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) is given by an integration over the surface of the sphere and a time average over the interval of 50  160 days .",
    "in an effort to exclude the disk ( which can be inflowing or outflowing , but with very high mass relative to the jet and disk wind ) , the data shown represent an integration over the surface up to an opening angle of 75 degrees .",
    "to get an idea of the relative uncertainties ( due to the fact that we are representing a time - dependent property by a time - averaged value ) in the data , we calculated the cumulative average of @xmath54 during the 50  160 day interval .",
    "we take three times the standard deviation of this cumulative average over the interval of 85  160 days as our uncertainty .",
    "this quantity reflects the uncertainty due to the periodicity of @xmath54 and due to the settling down of the system to a fixed period ( discussed further in  [ evaluation ] ) .",
    "all of the data in figure [ mdotfig ] have @xmath55 ",
    "@xmath56 @xmath33 yr@xmath1 , consistent with observations of yso outflows @xcite . also , @xmath54 increases with both disk density and magnetic field energy .",
    "once again , a power law nicely quantifies this dependence with @xmath49 = 0.2 for both panel a ) and b ) ( within uncertainty ) .",
    "the variation of mass outflow rate with the different field topologies , panel c ) , shows no clear trend .",
    "figure [ luminosityfig ] shows the variation in outflow luminosity , @xmath52 , for the parametric cases studied .",
    "the energy flux is the sum of the kinetic , magnetic , and the thermal energy fluxes . @xmath57 and the data in figure [ luminosityfig ] represent the time - averaged , integrated flux ( as for @xmath54 above ) .",
    "the format of the figure is the same as figures [ maxvelfig ] and [ mdotfig ] .",
    "the disk density has no obvious influence on @xmath58 , and the best fit power law is consistent with @xmath49 = 0 .",
    "the outflow luminosity does , however , depend on the initial magnetic field energy , suggesting a power law with @xmath49 = 0.4 .",
    "finally , the addition of a weak vertical field has no significant impact on outflow luminosity .",
    "an analysis of the angular momentum carried in the outflow , @xmath59 , is deferred to  [ angmom ] , where we use a semi - analytical formulation to understand the controlling parameters of the angular momentum extracted from the inner edge of the accretion disk .      in the jet launching process described in gbw ( also in @xcite , and , to some degree , in @xcite ) , the large scale magnetic field undergoes rapid inflation .",
    "this inflation results from the differential rotation between the star and the disk which twists the magnetic field , injecting helicity , and increasing the overall magnetic energy .",
    "the resulting magnetic field has characteristics that differ significantly from those of a dipole .",
    "figure [ expandfig ] illustrates the initial magnetic field expansion of the baseline case , demonstrating the rapid change from a dipole to a more complicated and open geometry .",
    "the basic process of magnetospheric inflation can be summarized as follows ( see gwb and gbw for details ) : the star is initially connected to the disk via the dipole magnetic field .",
    "differential rotation between the star and disk induces an azimuthal component of the magnetic field , increasing the magnetic pressure ( @xmath60 ) in the twisted region , which in turn inflates the poloidal component of the magnetic field .",
    "the expanded magnetic field has many properties that are different from the simple dipole .",
    "figure [ bslicefig ] illustrates the most significant differences for the discussion at hand .",
    "the figure shows the total magnetic field strength , @xmath61 , on a 45 degree line in the meridional plane for the baseline case .",
    "the lower solid line shows the original dipole field .",
    "the top solid line shows the total field , @xmath61(tot ) = @xmath62 , and the middle solid line shows the poloidal field , @xmath61(pol ) = @xmath63 , both at @xmath5 = 61.6 days .",
    "note that the dipole field decreases with distance as @xmath64 , the evolved total field decreases as @xmath65 with @xmath49 near 1.7 , and the evolved poloidal field decreases with @xmath49 roughly equal to 2.0 .",
    "also note that the evolved field has a `` dipole - like '' ( @xmath66 ) region close to the star ( @xmath67 ) , with a clear transition to an `` expansion - dominated '' ( @xmath68 1.5 - 2 ) region beyond .",
    "the total and poloidal field strengths are almost identical in the dipole - like region , indicating that @xmath69 is negligible there .",
    "a piece - wise continuous fit was made of the expanded field ( along a @xmath70 slice ) , of the form : @xmath71\\ ] ] in this fit , @xmath72 is the power law that applies in the interior , dipole - like region , and @xmath73 is the power law that applies in the exterior , expanded region .",
    "@xmath74 and @xmath75 are the field strengths that one would obtain at the surface of the star , if the power law could be extrapolated all the way to the stellar surface ( this is roughly the true surface value for the dipole - like fit , but not for the expanded field fit ) .",
    "both the total and poloidal field are fit in this way .",
    "the dashed lines in figure [ bslicefig ] are the fits to the total and poloidal field at @xmath76 days .",
    "table [ bpowertab ] lists the values of the magnetic field fit parameters for all of the simulations . since the values are time - dependent ( periodic ) , and it takes some time for the flow to be established in the entire simulation grid , table [ bpowertab ] data have been averaged during the interval of 50  160 days .",
    "to get an idea of the uncertainty of these values ( due to the episodic nature of the system ) , we first obtain the cumulative average during this interval . the uncertainty listed in the table",
    "is the standard deviation of this cumulative average during the interval of 85  160 days .",
    "for each case , column 2 and 3 contain the @xmath74 ( in gauss ) and @xmath72 values .",
    "since the total and poloidal field is nearly identical in this interior fit , we list only the value for the poloidal field .",
    "the last 4 columns contain similar values for the exterior portion of the fit for both the total and poloidal field components .",
    "when @xmath73(pol ) is near 2.0 , the poloidal field is essentially open ( @xmath77 for a purely radial field ) .",
    "this is roughly true for all cases , though the ones with weaker dipole fields ( row 4 and 6  8) have @xmath73(pol ) significantly less than than 2 .",
    "the primary conclusion from this data is that the total magnetic field strength will behave as @xmath65 where @xmath49 is between 1.5 and 2.0 .",
    "the cases with additional vertical field in the disk ( last two rows of table [ bpowertab ] ) have the largest magnetic to kinetic energy ratios ( far from the disk inner edge ) of all cases .",
    "however , since the magnetic field in the outflow originates in the stellar magnetosphere , the field in the evolved outflow of these cases is identical to the weak field and truncated disk case .",
    "the most striking result of this parametric study is that every case examined produces an outflow similar to that of gbw . for a variation of disk density of a factor of 16 , a variation in stellar magnetic field of a factor of 4 , and variations in initial disk truncation points and large scale magnetic field topologies ,",
    "all of the simulations produce outflows with jets and disk winds .",
    "the only differences are in the details of the star - disk interaction and in the magnitude of the outflow properties .",
    "table [ sensitivetab ] summarizes the sensitivities of the outflow properties and morphology to increasing the disk density and increasing the stellar magnetic energy .",
    "the listed numerical values are the spectral index ( @xmath49 ) from power laws that represent various data ( e.g. , the dotted lines in figures [ maxvelfig ] - [ luminosityfig ] ) .",
    "the least squares power law fits were weighted by the uncertainty ( as described in  [ outflowprop ] ) , and the errors in table [ sensitivetab ] are the formal 1-sigma errors of the fit .",
    "note that some of outflow properties listed in table [ sensitivetab ] are discussed in the following section .",
    "the main result of table [ sensitivetab ] is that variation of key system parameters do indeed cause variations in outflow properties , but the relationship is weak ( i.e. , @xmath78 is small ) .",
    "the star - disk - field system is self - regulating , due to the interaction between the disk and the outflow .",
    "the system adjusts to mitigate the impact of any single parameter change .",
    "also , the large scale field topology does not significantly affect any of the outflow properties .",
    "this result implies that it is indeed the interaction between the stellar magnetosphere and the accretion disk that drives the outflow , as opposed to the existence ( via artificial initial conditions as in gbw ) of a dipole field that threads the disk everywhere at @xmath5 = 0 .",
    "as noted in gbw and gw , the inner edge of the disk undergoes radial oscillations .",
    "these oscillations are actually a flux exchange process  on each oscillation , the stellar magnetosphere diffuses into the innermost regions of the disk and differential rotation inflates the magnetic field to an open configuration .",
    "the inflated field topology spins the disk down via magnetocentrifugal launching of disk plasma ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as it spins down and moves inward toward the star , the disk inner edge is stripped away from the rest of the disk . at the point of `` closest approach '' , a reconnection event alters the magnetic field topology , and the spun down portion of the disk flows along the newly reconnected field lines , accreting onto the star .",
    "figure [ oscillationfig ] illustrates the disk oscillations for the simulation cases where the accretion disk density is varied .",
    "the solid line is the radial location of the inner edge of the disk as a function of time .",
    "the dashed line shows the location of the keplerian co - rotation point ( where the stellar solid body rotation rate is equal to the keplerian rotation rate ) .",
    "the figure clearly demonstrates the dependence of disk oscillations on the disk density . as disk density",
    "is decreased , the amplitude and period of the oscillations increase .",
    "note that it takes time for the system to settle down to a constant period ( the physical explanation for this is discussed in  [ oscillation ] ) . in most cases ,",
    "the system becomes quasi - periodic after about 50 days , but the low density case seems only to be settling down near the end of the 160 day simulation .",
    "much of our uncertainty in all quantities is due to this effect , and we have calculated our uncertainties to reflect this .    as the average disk location approaches the keplerian co - rotation point ,",
    "the difference between the disk and stellar magnetosphere rotation rates is reduced , so the magnetosphere will expand more slowly .",
    "this is true in the high density case ( bottom panel ) , but here the disk oscillations are actually faster than in the other cases . also , even in the high density case , the oscillation period is much longer than the inflation timescale ( which is roughly the time for the disk inner edge and star to rotate to a differential angle of @xmath79 ; see @xcite ; gw ) .",
    "this supports the basic tenet of gw that the oscillation period is driven by the spin - down rate of the inner edge of the disk ( via magnetic torques ) rather than the inflation rate of the magnetic field .",
    "ideally , the parametric simulation results presented here would allow for the disk oscillation model of gw to be tested .",
    "unfortunately , the data in  [ magfield ] require us to relax their assumption that the expanded magnetic field has reached a power law configuration characterized by @xmath80 .",
    "while this may be true for the poloidal field of many cases ( see table [ bpowertab ] ) , it is more generally true that the expanded field reaches a configuration with @xmath81 , with @xmath49 between 1.5 and 2.0 ( and @xmath82 not necessarily equal to the stellar surface value ) .",
    "we will also discard the assumption of gw that the accretion disk has reached a secular steady state , where the accretion rate onto the star ( regulated by the interaction between the stellar magnetosphere and the inner edge of the disk ) equals the accretion rate given by the @xmath2-disk description of the disk . while this secular steady state does exist near the end of simulations , the accretion rate in the outer portion of the simulated disk is unlikely to be equal to the @xmath2-disk model .",
    "this is because the physics of the shakura - sunyaev @xmath2-disk model are not fully captured in the simulations .",
    "however , we will show in the following section that the extraction of angular momentum from the inner edge of the disk can be simply understood and determined from simulation data . in light of this",
    ", we present a modified disk oscillation model ( in  [ oscillation ] ) , in which the angular momentum extraction can be a prescribed value  thus removing the assumption of secular stead state in the disk .    we should point out that it is our ultimate goal to be able to determine the properties of the outflow ( @xmath54 , @xmath83 , @xmath52 , oscillation period , etc . ) generated by the star - disk interaction a priori from the physical parameters of the system ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 , disk accretion rate , etc . ) .",
    "unfortunately , the complexity of the model , which includes a relatively large number of parameters , makes this difficult . the following work in this section",
    "is thus meant to be an early step in that direction . as such",
    ", this semi - analytical work relies on some quantities derived from the outcome of the simulations ( e.g. , @xmath82 ) . the work presented in  [ angmom ] and  [ oscillation ] , therefore , is useful for testing our understanding of the most relevant physics controlling the oscillations , and thus the accretion / ejection mechanism .",
    "it will also serve as a check for self - consistency in the simulations .",
    "consider an inner region of the disk that is threaded by a magnetic field . from the analytical work of @xcite",
    ", we note that the angular momentum transported in the wind of a magnetic rotator is @xmath86 ( where @xmath87 is the angular velocity of the footpoint of the flux tube , and @xmath88 is the alfvn radius ) . assuming nearly rigid rotation of plasma out to @xmath88 ( for a discussion of this assumption , see , e.g. , @xcite ) , plasma will be magnetocentrifugally launched along field lines via the blandford - payne mechanism @xcite ,",
    "provided the field lines make an angle of more than 30 degrees from vertical .",
    "this angle is typically 45 to 55 degrees in our simulations . for a simple approach",
    ", we ll assume that the velocity of the wind at the alfvn radius is @xmath89 .",
    "this is strictly true for @xmath90 ( where @xmath91 is the position of the field footpoint in the disk ) .",
    "the alfvn radius , then , can be estimated by examining the energy balance at that location : @xmath92 when expressed in terms of outflow properties , and assuming the magnetic field behaves as @xmath93 , this becomes @xmath94 here , we have assumed that @xmath95 .",
    "note that this assumption is not valid for an anisotropic wind , so we introduced a filling factor , @xmath96 , by which the mass outflow rate is reduced .",
    "reducing equation [ engybalouteq ] and solving for @xmath88 gives @xmath97 and so @xmath98    the dependence of @xmath53 on various outflow properties is interesting .",
    "the strength of the dependence relies only on @xmath49 , the magnetic field power law fall off .",
    "note that if @xmath49 = 1.5 , equation [ jdoteq ] becomes @xmath99 and @xmath53 is independent of both @xmath54 and @xmath87 .",
    "in general , for any @xmath49 between 1.5 and 2.0 , the exponent on the factor @xmath100 in equation [ jdoteq ] is substantially smaller than on the factor @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , the extraction of angular momentum should be most sensitive to the magnetic field strength .",
    "the simulations verify this conclusion .",
    "figure [ jcompfig ] shows the angular momentum outflow rate for all cases .",
    "the data ( squares ) are calculated as described in ",
    "[ outflowprop ] , and shown in the same format as figure [ maxvelfig ] .",
    "it is clear that the angular momentum carried in the simulation outflow is more dependent on magnetic energy than on disk density , which influences @xmath102 and @xmath87 ( see figures [ mdotfig ] and [ oscillationfig ] ) . in fact ,",
    "panel a ) of figure [ jcompfig ] shows no obvious dependence of @xmath53 on disk density at all ( also see the fifth row of table [ sensitivetab ] ) .",
    "this also appears to be true for the cases with various field topologies shown in panel c ) , where there is no clear trend , especially considering the larger uncertainties .",
    "the simulations also offer a quantitative test of equation [ jdoteq ] .",
    "we used the time - averaged simulation values for @xmath51 , @xmath87 , @xmath82 , and @xmath49 ( the magnetic field power law fall off ) for each case and calculated @xmath53 using equation [ jdoteq ] . since the inner edge of the disk spends most of the time beyond 5 @xmath37",
    "( see figure [ oscillationfig ] ) , the value of @xmath82 and @xmath49 to use comes from the outer portion of the piece - wise fit to the magnetic field strength in the simulations .",
    "also , since angular momentum is added to the wind via the poloidal field anchored in the disk , the calculated values of @xmath53 use @xmath75(pol ) and @xmath73(pol ) .",
    "we chose a single value of the filling factor ( @xmath96 = 0.43 ) , so that the calculated values match the baseline result .",
    "these calculated values ( triangles in figure [ jcompfig ] ) can be directly compared to the simulated values ( squares ) , and the agreement between them is remarkable . the largest disagreement is ( for the closed magnetosphere case ) at the 50% level .",
    "in the context of equation [ jdoteq ] and the assumptions at the beginning of this section , it seems clear that variations in the location of the inner edge of the disk ( which is the launching point for much of the outflow ) and in @xmath54 ( which is related to the conditions at the footpoint of the flux tube ) have little relative impact on the angular momentum ejected from the system .",
    "the primary reason for this is the restructuring of the initial magnetic field . as evident in table [ bpowertab ]",
    "( also see figs [ expandfig ] and [ bslicefig ] ) , the magnetic field rapidly evolves into a state that follows a radial power law with @xmath49 between 1.5 and 2.0 , increasing the importance of @xmath82 relative to @xmath54 and @xmath103 .",
    "in addition to this , the magnetic field in the outflow seems to be restructured in such a way that it `` softens '' the effect ( on @xmath59 ) of the parameters varied .",
    "for example , the @xmath75(tot ) values for the weak field , baseline , and strong field cases are 550 , 750 , and 1180 gauss , respectively .",
    "the entire range in these values is only a factor of 2 , even though the entire range of stellar surface dipole field strengths ( which is the only simulation parameter changed among these cases ) is a factor of 4 .",
    "thus , a given variation in the stellar surface magnetic field strength can not be used in conjunction with equation [ jdoteq ] alone to determine the resulting variation in @xmath53 .",
    "the self - regulating nature of the system indeed makes prediction difficult .      in their oscillation model , gw assumed that the magnetic field associated with the stellar magnetosphere would diffuse into the disk radially at a given radial velocity ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "the differing azimuthal velocities of the inner edge of the disk and the stellar magnetosphere ( which rotates at the angular rotation rate of the star ) leads to a rapid inflation of the magnetosphere ( note that @xmath105 and @xmath104 ) .",
    "the inflated magnetic configuration removes angular momentum from the inner edge of the disk ( via magnetocentrifugal launching of disk plasma ) , spinning it down .",
    "the inner edge of the disk will eventually achieve the condition where its inward radial velocity exceeds the velocity at which the magnetic field is diffusing out into the disk ( @xmath106 ) . at this point",
    ", the inner edge of the disk separates from the rest of the disk , and spirals inward to the star , where a fraction of it is ultimately accreted by the star , and a fraction is expelled in the outflow .",
    "thus , the diffusive velocity ( @xmath104 ) determines how much of the disk separates for each oscillation , and so sets the mass accretion rate .",
    "there are two main assumptions in the disk oscillation model of gw that must be modified .",
    "they calculated the radial velocity of the disk inner edge ( as it spins down ; their eq .",
    "9 ) as a function of @xmath23 , @xmath104 , @xmath91 ( the radial position of the disk inner edge ) , @xmath107 ( the surface density there ) , and @xmath85 .",
    "we first modify their assumption that @xmath108 to the more general case , @xmath81 , and get @xmath109 ^ 2 r -   b_0 ^ 2 r_*^{2n } \\pi r_{\\rm d } \\sigma(r_{\\rm d } ) r^{4 - 2n}\\}^{1\\over 2 } \\over g m _ * [ 2 \\pi r_{\\rm d } \\sigma(r_{\\rm d})]^2 - b_0 ^ 2 r_*^{2n } \\pi r_{\\rm d } \\sigma(r_{\\rm d } ) ( 4 - 2n ) r^{3 - 2n}}\\ ] ] note that when @xmath49 = 2 , equation [ diskmotioneq ] reduces to gw s equation 9 .",
    "the second assumption of gw to discard is that the accretion rate from the disk inner edge ( regulated by the interaction of star s magnetosphere and the disk ) is the same as the accretion rate given analytically by the @xmath2-disk description .",
    "instead , we assume that the angular momentum carried in the outflow ( see  [ angmom ] and fig .",
    "[ jcompfig ] ) is equal to the amount extracted from the disk inner edge .",
    "figures [ amplitudefig ] and [ periodfig ] contain the simulated disk oscillation amplitudes and periods ( squares and dotted lines ; in the same format as fig .",
    "[ maxvelfig ] ) . since it takes some time for the oscillations to settle down ( see fig .",
    "[ oscillationfig ] ) , the simulated amplitude of the disk oscillations plotted in figure [ amplitudefig ] are the maximum separation of the star and disk inner edge 160 days into the simulation . the simulated periods ( fig .  [ periodfig ] ) are also taken at this time . as a measure of the uncertainty ( represented by error bars in the figures )",
    ", we use the difference between the amplitude at 160 days and the value at 85 days . for the period , we use the same method , but",
    "the error bars have been doubled to show up better on the plot .",
    "the `` settling down '' of the disk oscillations is a result of the initial conditions .",
    "equation [ diskmotioneq ] indicates that , as @xmath91 increases , @xmath110 decreases ( due to a decrease in the magnetic torque and an increase of the amount of angular momentum at that radius ) , and a ring from the disk inner edge has further to fall , so the period increases .",
    "also , gw showed ( their fig .",
    "7 ) that the accretion rate decreases for increasing @xmath91 .",
    "if the initial state of the system ( in the simulations ) is such that the accretion rate regulated by the star - disk interaction ( @xmath111 ) is greater than the accretion rate further out in the disk ( at @xmath112 ; @xmath113 ) , the inner region of the disk will be cleared out ( thus increasing @xmath91 ) until the two accretion rates are equal .",
    "notice that the cases in panels a ) of figures [ amplitudefig ] and [ periodfig ] show a relatively strong variation in amplitude and period , even though the angular momentum extraction rate is roughly equal among them ( see fig .",
    "[ jcompfig ] ) .",
    "this is explained by the fact that , for a denser disk , @xmath113 is larger , so the final state of the system will have a smaller amplitude and , therefore , a shorter period .",
    "the previous section showed that angular momentum extraction depends most strongly on the magnetic field strength .",
    "this seems to imply that , for stronger magnetic fields , the oscillation periods should be shorter ( since a ring of disk material would spiral in faster ) .",
    "this would indeed be the case if @xmath91 were a fixed quantity .",
    "however , when the magnetosphere - disk interaction can extract more angular momentum from a given radius , @xmath111 increases , so the final state of the system will actually have a larger @xmath114 and a longer period .",
    "this is evident in panels b ) of figures [ jcompfig ]  [ periodfig ] .    to calculate the period and amplitude of disk oscillations , following gw",
    ", we used an iterative process in which we first pick a radial location for the disk inner edge ( @xmath91 ) and integrate equation [ diskmotioneq ] to obtain a spin down time . equation [ diskmotioneq ] requires the case - specific values of @xmath75(tot ) and @xmath73(tot ) listed in table [ bpowertab ] .",
    "this method gives a simultaneous prediction of the oscillation amplitude and period .",
    "as opposed to gw , we adopt the @xmath91 value that satisfies the requirement that the angular momentum extracted from the ring of material ( as it falls toward the star ) divided by the oscillation period ( taken as twice the spin down time ) equals the angular momentum extraction rate in the simulations ( displayed in fig.[jcompfig ] ) . as in gw , we need an estimate of @xmath104 , in order to calculate the mass of the ring of material that is stripped off of the disk inner edge .",
    "we use @xmath115 ( @xmath116 is the initial disk scale height and depends on @xmath91 ) , which differs from gw s approximation by the factor @xmath117 .",
    "this factor is necessary because the average disk scale height during the simulations is larger than the initial value .",
    "this has two causes : a ) the magnetic interaction increases the scale height above the initial analytical value , and b ) the numerical diffusion of disk material is not negligible ( @xmath116 is typically only a few grid points at @xmath114 ) . for each case",
    ", then , we used our explit value of @xmath118 @xmath20 s@xmath1 , and chose @xmath117 to best fit the disk oscillation period .",
    "in all cases , @xmath117 ranged from 3 to 9 .",
    "the predictions of the modified model presented here ( triangles in fig.s [ amplitudefig ] and [ periodfig ] ) match the simulated results ( squares ) well for the cases with various stellar magnetic field strengths and disk densities , but are consistently too small for the cases with various field topologies .",
    "remember that the the cases in panel c ) of figures [ amplitudefig ] and [ periodfig ] have a disk which is initially truncated further out than all other cases .",
    "since their initial truncation radius is further out than the final disk oscillation amplitude of the weak field case ( to which they are otherwise similar ) , these cases have an initial state in which @xmath119 . the mismatch between the data an predictions for these models may be due to a significant alteration of the disk density profile from its initial state .",
    "the agreement of the predictions of this modified model with the data implies that the fundamental assumptions of the model are valid ( at least in the simulations ) .",
    "those assumptions are : 1 ) the disk oscillations are associated with a flux interchange process where magnetic flux diffuses into the inner - most edge of the disk .",
    "2 ) the disk oscillations are driven by spin - down torques associated with the magnetic field that threads the disk .",
    "3 ) the spin - down rate is driven by the surface density of the accretion disk and the magnetic field topology .",
    "4 ) what appear to be large scale disk oscillation are actually the spin - down of a ring of material from the inner most edge of the disk .",
    "the mechanism presented by gbw and gw for the launching of jets is promising , but it is difficult to make a priori predictions , given the large number of parameters in the star - disk system .",
    "one has to consider the effects of the mass of the star and disk , the magnetic field strength , and the stellar rotation rate , to name a few .",
    "in addition , the disk responds to the conditions in its environment , so one must also consider the self - consistent interaction between the disk , outflow , and changing magnetic field topology .",
    "the complexity of this model prompted us to carry out a parameter survey using magnetohydrodynamic simulations . using the case presented by gbw as a baseline , we examined cases with various initial disk densities , various stellar dipole field strengths , and cases with additional `` primordial '' field associated with the disk .",
    "the results of this survey are :    1 .",
    "the fundamental mechanism for jet formation is robust .",
    "2 .   the star - disk - outflow system is self - regulating .",
    "the mechanism is independent of magnetic flux that may exist in the disk .",
    "we have improved the disk oscillation model of gw .",
    "the robust nature of the mechanism is best demonstrated by examination of figures [ jetdensfig ]  [ jetgeomfig ] . for variations of initial disk density , variations in stellar magnetic field strength , and variations in initial disk truncation points and large scale magnetic field topologies , all of the simulations produced outflows with similar morphologies .",
    "all outflows consisted of a highly collimated , knotty jet and a less collimated `` disk wind '' ( including a `` wispy '' structure associated with magnetic reconnection ) . also , the outflows were always episodic with the period set by the oscillations of the inner edge of the disk .",
    "the magnitude and timescales of outflow characteristics , however , do depend on the magnetic field strength and the density of the accretion disk , and we were able to address these dependencies in a quantitative way .",
    "as seen in figures [ maxvelfig ]  [ luminosityfig ] , [ jcompfig ]  [ periodfig ] , and in table [ sensitivetab ] , variation of key system parameters do indeed cause variations in outflow properties , but the relationship is fairly weak ( the strongest power law relating a system property to the initial conditions has @xmath120 ) .",
    "this self - regulating nature of the system suggests that the self - consistent interaction between the disk , outflow , and stellar magnetosphere `` softens '' the effect of any single parameter change .",
    "for example , we found in ",
    "[ angmom ] that the large scale magnetic field structure rapidly evolves to a configuration that removes angular momentum from the disk at a rate that depends most strongly on the evolved field and much more weakly on other parameters .",
    "also , when the stellar magnetic field is changed , the outer region of the evolved field ( which is important for the extraction of angular momentum ) has characteristics which only partially reflect the surface value change .    the robust and self - regulating nature of this system",
    "imply that , if such a mechanism does occur in astrophysical systems , it should indeed be ubiquitous , and may actually be the prime mechanism for the formation of non - relativistic astrophysical jets .",
    "unfortunately the self - regulating nature also means that observable ( or deduceable ) properties of outflows , such as the mass outflow rate or the rate of angular momentum expelled from the system , will contain a limited amount of information about the properties of the star - disk systems .",
    "figures [ maxvelfig ]  [ luminosityfig ] and [ jcompfig ]  [ periodfig ] also demonstrated with some certainty that the system properties examined do not depend on the amount or direction of magnetic flux that initially threads the disk . for each system property we examined , there is at least a weak dependence on the initial stellar magnetic field energy , evident in panel b ) of each of these figures .",
    "however , as seen in the c ) panels , for the cases with additional vertical field ( and therefore additional magnetic energy in the disk ) , there were no convincing trends . implicitly , therefore , it is the interaction between the stellar magnetosphere and the inner edge of the accretion disk that drives the outflow , as opposed to the existence ( via artificial initial conditions ) of a dipole field that threads the disk everywhere at @xmath5 = 0 .",
    "note , however , that for stronger vertical fields , magnetocentrifugal launching of disk plasma may increase at larger radii ( leading to an increased collimation of the material launched from the disk inner edge ) .",
    "magnetized disk models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will become important , independent from and in addition to the mechanism presented here . a system with a dynamically important stellar dipole field and disk - associated field might produce an outflow with an episodic / unsteady core ( closest to the axis of rotation ) and a `` cocoon '' of material originating from the disk .",
    "we also evaluated and modified the disk oscillations model of gw (  [ evaluation ] ) . using a semi - analytical method",
    ", we tested and confirmed many of their basic assumptions , including the idea that the oscillation period is set by spin down time of disk inner edge , not by the inflation of magnetosphere .",
    "therefore , we demonstrated that the basic physical mechanism for disk oscillations is understood .",
    "there is still work to be done with the accretion / ejection mechanism presented here in order to decide whether such a process occurs in real astrophysical systems .",
    "future work is planned to determine the importance of other properties of the system , though the qualitative mechanism is valid for a wide range of parameters . in particular",
    ", the stellar rotation rate certainly influences the details of the outflow characteristics , but the inflation of the magnetosphere will always occur , even in the extreme case of a non - rotating star , due to the differential rotation in the accretion disk . also , a more realistic treatment of the accretion disk , possibly including the effects of the disk viscosity or the magnetorotational instability @xcite , would affect the star - disk interaction through the accretion rate ( @xmath113 ) , and will thus change the period and amplitude of the disk oscillations . future work will also examine the system under true three - dimensional conditions . the effect of radiative cooling / heating may not be negligible , especially considering that the coupling of the field to the gas is dependent on the specific ionization state and composition of the circumstellar matter .    the disk oscillation process , and therefore the jet launching mechanism , is fundamentally driven by a diffusive process which is poorly understood . recall that the mechanism requires magnetic reconnection ( a diffusive process with physics that are partially understood ;",
    "see @xcite ) for accretion and re - expansion .",
    "gbw point out that this model is not particular sensitive to the physics of magnetic reconnection , since regions of oppositely directed magnetic field are driven together by the disk oscillations . however , this is only a partial solution to the dilemma , since the disk oscillation mechanism itself is initiated by the diffusion of stellar magnetospheric flux into the disk inner edge .",
    "the timescale for knot formation predicted by this mechanism is a factor of @xmath4 different than observed for hh 30 , and the rudimentary scaling laws offered by this parametric study do not offer an obvious solution to the discrepancy .",
    "the timescale predicted by this work ( several tens of days ) can not presently be resolved by direct imaging ( there would be several tens of knots in a typical optical resolution element ) , so one can not yet rule it out . however , even if there exists a short timescale present in astrophysical systems that can be explained by this mechanism , there is then no detailed theoretical prediction of the observed longer timescale",
    ". a primary focus of future work with this model will be the timescale for disk oscillations / knot formation .",
    "another criticism of this work ( as well as many other models ; see  [ intro ] ) addresses the assumption that the central star has a strong dipole magnetic field ( dominating over other multipolar components which may exist ) .",
    "detailed observations of the magnetic fields in t tauri stars ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that strong , ordered fields may not dominate ; rather , the stellar field topology appears to be time - variable and non - axisymmetric .",
    "whether such a field can participate in the mechanism described here ( e.g. , via non - axisymmetric magnetic flux tubes connecting the star and disk ) is not known .",

    "<S> the large scale magnetic field structure rapidly evolves to a configuration that removes angular momentum from the disk at a rate that depends most strongly on the field and weakly on the rotation rate of the foot - points of the field in the disk and the mass outflow rate . </S>",
    "<S> third , the simulated jets are episodic , with the timescale of jet outbursts identical to the timescale of magnetically induced oscillations of the inner edge of the disk . to better understand the physics controlling these disk oscillations , we present a semi - analytical model and confirm that the oscillation period is set by the spin down rate of the disk inner edge . </S>",
    "<S> finally , our simulations offer strong evidence that it is indeed the interaction of the stellar magnetosphere with the disk , rather than some primordial field in the disk itself , that is responsible for the formation of jets from these systems . </S>"
