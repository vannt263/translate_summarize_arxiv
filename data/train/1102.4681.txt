    "solving polynomial equation systems is a basic problem in the field of computational science and has important engineering applications . in most cases",
    ", we consider zero - dimensional polynomial systems .",
    "we will discuss how to solve this kind of systems in this paper .",
    "in particular , we will consider how to isolate the complex roots for such a system .",
    "one of the basic methods to solve polynomial equation systems is based on the concept of separating elements , which can be traced back to kronecker @xcite and has been studied extensively in the past twenty years @xcite .",
    "the idea of the method is to introduce a new variable @xmath0 which is a linear combination of the variables to be solved such that @xmath1 takes different values when evaluated at different roots of the polynomial equation system @xmath2 .",
    "in such a case , we say that @xmath3 is a * separating element * for @xmath2 . if @xmath1 is a separating element for @xmath2 , the roots of @xmath2 have the following rational univariate representation ( rur ) : @xmath4 where @xmath5 $ ] and @xmath6 are rational functions in @xmath3 . as a consequence , solving multi - variate equation systems is reduced to solving a univariate equation @xmath7 and to substituting the roots of @xmath7 into rational functions @xmath6 . along this line ,",
    "better complexity bounds and effective software packages for solving polynomial equations such as the maple package rootfinding by rouillier @xcite and the magma package kronecker by giusti , lecerf , and salvy @xcite are given .",
    "the above approaches still have the following problem : for an isolation interval @xmath8 $ ] of a real root @xmath9 of @xmath10 , to determine the isolation interval of @xmath11 under a given precision is not a trivial task . in this paper",
    ", we propose a new representation for the roots of a polynomial system which will remedy this drawback .    .",
    "the red diamonds ( blue crosses , black circles ) are roots of @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) and red ( blue ) boxes are neighborhoods for the red diamonds ( blue crosses ) . ]    in the issac paper @xcite , based on ideas similar to separating elements , a local generic position method is introduced to solve bivariate polynomial systems and experimental results show that the method is quite efficient for solving equation systems with multiple roots . in this paper , we extend the method to solve general zero - dimensional polynomial systems . a local generic position for a polynomial equation system",
    "@xmath14 is also a linear combination of the variables to be solved : @xmath1 which satisfies two conditions .",
    "first , @xmath15 is a separating element of @xmath16 $ ] for @xmath17 , and the roots of @xmath18 have a one - to - one correspondence with the roots of a univariate equation @xmath19 .",
    "second , for a root @xmath20 of @xmath18 represented by a root @xmath21 of @xmath19 , all the roots @xmath22 of @xmath23 corresponding to the roots of @xmath24 , say @xmath25 ,  lifted \" from @xmath26 are projected into a fixed square neighborhood of @xmath21 . this ",
    "local \" property is illustrated in figure [ fig - slope ] .",
    "we prove that if @xmath27 is a local generic position for @xmath28 , then the roots of @xmath2 can be be represented as special linear combinations of the roots of univariate equations @xmath29 : @xmath30 where @xmath31 are certain positive rational numbers and the @xmath32 matching @xmath33 are in certain square neighborhood of @xmath33 to be defined in section 2 .",
    "such a representation is called a * linear univariate representation * ( lur for short ) of the polynomial system .",
    "the main advantage of the lur representation is that the precision of the roots can be easily controlled . for rur ,",
    "computing solutions with a given precision is not a trivial task as we mentioned before .",
    "it is not easy to know with which precision to isolate the roots of @xmath7 is enough in order for the roots of the system @xmath34 to satisfy a given precision . for lur",
    ", precision control becomes very easy .",
    "we can give an explicit formula for the precision of the roots of @xmath35 in order to obtain the roots of the system with a given precision .",
    "so we can obtain the solutions of the system by refining the roots of @xmath35 at most once .",
    "another advantage of lur is that when we isolate the roots of @xmath36 , we need only to consider a fixed neighborhood of each root of @xmath35 .",
    "we propose an algorithm to compute an lur for a zero - dimensional polynomial system .",
    "the key ingredients of the algorithm are to estimate the root bounds of @xmath14 and to estimate the separating bounds for the roots of @xmath37 lifted from a root of @xmath38 .",
    "we adopt a computational approach to estimate such bounds in order to obtain tight bound values . for the root bounds of @xmath14 , we use grbner basis computation to obtain the generating polynomial of the principal ideal @xmath39 $ ] and use this polynomial to estimate the root bound for the @xmath40 coordinates of the roots of @xmath14 .",
    "the separating bounds for @xmath41 are obtained from the isolating boxes for the roots of the @xmath42 . these bounds in turn will be used to compute the isolating boxes for the roots of @xmath37 .",
    "hence , the algorithm to compute an lur also gives a set of isolating boxes for the roots of @xmath14 .    in section 2",
    ", we give the definition of lur and the main result of the paper . in section 3",
    ", we present an algorithm to compute an lur of a zero - dimensional polynomial system as well as a set of isolation boxes of the roots of the equation system . in section 4 ,",
    "we provide some illustrative examples .",
    "we conclude the paper in section 5 .",
    "in this section , we will define lur and prove its main properties .",

    "let @xmath58 be a complex number and @xmath59 a positive rational number .",
    "then the set of points having distance less than @xmath59 with @xmath58 , that is @xmath60 , is an open square with @xmath58 as the center .    by an lur ,",
