    "current observational measurements obtained from many astronomical experiments ( like supernova ( ia ) , wmap , sdss , galactic cluster emission of x - rays , large scale structure and weak lensing etc . ) strengthened the picture of cosmic expansion at an accelerating rate @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this significant phenomenon of cosmic expansion is prompted by dark energy ( de ) , a mysterious unusual kind of matter containing negative pressure .",
    "this is inconsistent with the strong energy condition and plays a dominant role in the composition of our universe @xcite .",
    "the investigation of its obscure nature is one of the most fascinating issues in modern cosmology .",

    ", none of them provides an unambiguous solution to this problem and thus leaving it as a mystery for the researchers .",
    "general relativity , in spite of its success in many ways , remained unsuccessful for describing the reality of de and some other cosmological issues .",
    "this suggested the exploration of alternative theories of gravity by taking some modifications in einstein hilbert action @xcite .",
    "for this purpose , numerous modified gravity theories like gauss - bonnet theory , scalar tensor theories , @xmath0 and @xmath1 gravities and recently , @xmath2 gravity theory etc . have been constructed @xcite . among these modified theories ,",
    "scalar - tensor theories are the most viable and interesting candidates of de . in scalar tensor theories ,",
    "the gravity effects are discussed by a tensor as well as a scalar field @xcite-@xcite .",

    "recently , we have investigated exact solution of the bd field equations by using perfect , anisotropic and magnetized anisotropic fluids as matter contents @xcite .    according to grand unified theories , the phase transition ( caused by the reduction in the temperature below some critical temperature in the initial epochs of the universe evolution ) results in the creation of some topological defects including domain walls and cosmic strings etc .",

    "the study of bianchi universe models is of great significance @xcite .",
    "the lrs bi universe model , as the simplest generalization of frw universe model , is described by an anisotropic spacetime exhibiting spatial homogeneity @xcite @xmath18 here the expansion in @xmath19 direction is measured by the scale factor @xmath20 , while in @xmath21 and @xmath22 directions it is measured by the scale factor @xmath23 .",
    "the corresponding field equations ( [ 2 ] ) become @xmath24 the bd scalar wave equation yields @xmath25 it is interesting to mention here that the energy conservation , @xmath26 , leads to a linearly dependent equation as it is an outcome of covariant divergence of the bd equations ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) .",

    "the magnetic flux vector has only one non - zero component @xmath58 .",
    "moreover , the assumption of infinitely large conductivity along with finite current ( in magnetohydrodynamics limit ) leads to @xmath59 @xcite .",

    "the anisotropic measure of expansion leads to @xmath100 which is constant ( as we have taken the shear scalar proportional to expansion scalar ) and it becomes zero for @xmath101 . in our case ,",
    "@xmath102 , thus the universe model remains anisotropic throughout the cosmic time .",
    "the energy density remains positive for the allowed range of parameters as shown in figure * 1(a)*. however , it becomes infinite at initial epoch but decreases for final phases of the universe evolution .",
    "the energy density approaches to a positive value due to viscosity , given by @xmath103\\ ] ] as @xmath99 .",
    "if we take viscosity to be negligible , then the density approaches to zero for later times thus representing an empty universe in future .",
    "the string tension density @xmath37 increases with the passage of time and then remains a constant for future evolution of the universe as shown in figure * 1(b)*. the particle density @xmath55 exhibits a similar behavior as does the energy density .",
    "it decreases from infinite value ( at @xmath104 ) to a certain constant due to viscosity effects and then remains constant for the future evolution as shown in figure * 2(a)*.    the model results in dynamical deceleration parameter and consequently leads to negative as well as positive values for certain choices of parameters . for later time with @xmath105 and @xmath106 ,",
    "the deceleration parameter becomes negative , indicating accelerated expanding behavior of the universe model given by @xmath107 however , for other choices of parameters , it exhibits decelerating behavior .",
    "the graph of deceleration parameter for particular choices of the parameters is given in figure * 2(b)*. it is clear that the model represents accelerated expanding universe as the deceleration parameter attains small negative values as shown in this figure .",
    "the graphical illustration for expansion scalar is given in figure * 3(a ) * , while the shear scalar , directional and mean hubble parameters exhibit a similar behavior .",
    "these parameters go to zero when @xmath108 and diverge for initial time indicating the beginning of the universe model with a big bang explosion as shown in figure * 3(a)*. figure * 3(b ) * indicates the graphical behavior of viscosity parameter @xmath47 which is opposite to the expansion scalar ( in accordance with our assumption ) .",
    "the viscosity parameter is negligible at the initial epoch and increases with the passage of time as shown in figure * 3(b)*. hence it prevents the universe to be empty for its future evolution .",
    "it is argued that magnetic field has cosmological origin as there was highly ionized matter that was coupled to magnetic field which further leads to neutral matter as a consequence of universe expansion .",
    "it is interesting to discuss the magnetic field effects on the expansion history of the universe .",
    "moreover , bulk viscosity effects and scalar field have important role for obtaining accelerated expanding universe model .",
    "thus it would be worthwhile to discuss bi universe filled with magnetized bulk viscous strings for the discussion of early and late stages of the universe in scalar tensor theories .",
    "this paper investigates the cosmological model in self - interacting bd gravity with magnetized bulk viscous cloud of strings by taking certain physical conditions .",
    "all the cosmological parameters depend upon the values of bd parameter @xmath10 , parameter @xmath109 as well as parameter @xmath110 ( that appear due to scalar field ) .",
    "we have discussed the resulting model using different physical parameters through graphs .",
    "the results are summarized as follows .    * according to hubble @xcite , there would have been an infinitely hot and dense universe in its early phase .",
    "in fact , all the density of the universe was concentrated at a single point and hence initially there was zero volume of the universe .",
    "penrose and hawking @xcite have argued that expansion of the universe has been started from this dense and hot phase by an explosion and then universe is going to expand till today .",
    "after infinite time , universe would have infinite volume with negligible density . in our case , the proper energy density , string tension density as well as particle density remain positive for increasing bd parameter values and cosmic time . at initial epoch ,",
    "the proper energy and particle densities diverge while they turn out to be finite for later time due to bulk viscous effects .",
    "hence the presence of viscosity prevents the universe to be empty in its future evolution .",
    "clearly , the physical behavior of our constructed model supports these arguments as energy densities turn out to be infinite ( divergent ) at initial epoch and hence is of considerable interest .",
    "however , the string tension density increases with the increase in time and bd parameter values . * different parameters like @xmath111 and @xmath32 exhibit increasing behavior for decreasing @xmath112 and",
    "become divergent at initial epoch indicating the big bang start of the model . however , these parameters approach to zero asymptotically , i.e. , @xmath99 .",
    "thus the constructed model has an initial singularity .",
    "moreover , scalar field evolves from zero ( initially ) to infinite value as @xmath99 . * as we have discussed in our previous work @xcite , in case of bi universe filled with perfect fluid , there is a constant and positive deceleration parameter yielding decelerated expanding universe model .",
    "this problem is then resolved by taking anisotropic matter contents . in present work ,",
    "the deceleration parameter turns out to be a dynamical quantity rather than a constant due to the presence of self - interacting potential , viscosity and magnetic field effects which can provide negative values and hence yields accelerated expansion of universe . for example , if we take @xmath99 and @xmath113 as well as decreasing values of scalar field , the deceleration parameter gives negative values lying in the range @xmath114 which is in good agreement with the observed range for cosmic expansion as shown in figure * 2(b)*. * the anisotropic measure of expansion of the universe model turns out to be a constant showing that the universe model exhibits anisotropic behavior through the whole range of cosmic time . in @xcite , it has been pointed out that some large - angle anomalies are seen in cmb radiations , violating the statistical isotropy of the observable universe . for a better description of these anomalies , plane symmetric and",
    "homogeneous but anisotropic universe models play a very significant role .",
    "moreover , it is found @xcite-@xcite that removing a bianchi component in wmap data can explain various large - angle anomalies yielding an isotropic universe .",
    "thus the universe may have accomplished a slight anisotropic geometry in cosmological models irrespective of inflation .",
    "if the anisotropic nature of the model is maintained through the whole range of time , then it may explain or discuss these large - angle anomalies in cmb radiations .",
    "* the viscosity parameter increases with the passage of time which corresponds to a non - empty universe in future .",
    "* in all physical parameters , the component of magnetic field has a negative contribution , i.e. , these physical parameters reduce due to the presence of magnetic field .    in @xcite ,",
    "a class of bianchi ii , vii and ix filled with cosmic string fluid within saez and ballester gravity is discussed .",
    "it is found that the constructed model has no initial singularity which is inconsistent with the big bang model .",
    "likewise , in a new work @xcite , the same class is discussed with cosmological strings in bd gravity and it is observed that the volume of the universe model is contracting rather than expanding which is physically unacceptable .",
    "however , in the present work , no such ambiguity exists and the results are in well agreement with the observations .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention here that our results are consistent with those already available in the context of gr @xcite ."
