    "this indicates that some gas removal mechanisms work quite efficiently in the cluster center .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the shape and magnitude of quiescent galaxies in sdss and found that galaxies in dense environments include gas - removed spiral galaxies , adding to the evidence for rapid gas removal . a number of possible physical processes",
    "have been proposed to explain efficient gas removal in clusters : ram pressure @xcite or viscous stripping @xcite , tidal stripping by galaxy - galaxy interactions @xcite , or the cluster potential @xcite , evaporation @xcite , and to a lesser degree , galaxy harassment @xcite .",
    "one critical clue for understanding the gas removal is detection of the stripped gas .",
    "recent deep  imaging observations revealed that some of the galaxies in clusters are accompanied by   clouds .",
    "in the nearby cluster abell 1367 , @xcite found extended ionized gas regions associated with starburst irregular galaxies .",
    "the sizes of the regions are 75@xmath38 and 50@xmath38 kpc . @xcite",
    "discovered another extended emission line region ( @xmath435 kpc ) in the virgo cluster , which was found to be a part of 110@xmath325 kpc of hi gas @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported a narrow and long ( 60@xmath32 kpc )  emitting region associated with a galaxy of the coma cluster .",
    "@xcite found a @xmath4 40 kpc  tail of a galaxy in abell 3627 .",
    "the galaxy also had a @xmath4 70 kpc x - ray tail .",
    "@xcite investigated the galaxy to show two of @xmath4 80 kpc tails , and also reported one more galaxy with @xmath520 kpc  tail in the cluster .",
    "@xcite detected 120 kpc  filaments from ngc 4438 , a spiral galaxy in the virgo cluster .",
    "@xcite reported a galaxy with detached  clouds with young blue stars in the coma cluster , which resembles two galaxies in z@xmath40.2 clusters reported by @xcite .",
    "these  cloud findings imply that gas removal mechanisms to form such extended emission line regions are common in clusters of galaxies . however , it is not yet clear how common this phenomenon is .",
    "the coma cluster is the nearest rich cluster of galaxies , and is the best target for investigating the  clouds in the cluster environment with a deep and spatially resolved observation .",
    "we have performed a deep  narrow band imaging survey of the coma cluster using the suprime - cam at the subaru telescope and have already reported some of the prominent clouds detected @xcite . here , we report significant , extended  clouds around further 12 galaxies , increasing the sample to a total of 14 .",
    "this is the first paper in a series providing a statistical discussion of extended emission line regions in the central region of the coma cluster .",
    "the nature of the clouds and physical interpretations will be presented in subsequent papers .",
    "we assume that the distance modulus of the coma cluster is @xmath6 @xcite and ( @xmath7,@xmath8,@xmath9)=(0.71,0.27,0.73 ) @xcite . under these assumptions ,",
    "the angular diameter distance is 97.47 mpc , and 1 arcsec corresponds to 0.473 kpc .",
    "we observed a field around the coma cluster center ( @xmath10)(j2000.)=(12:59:26,+27:44:16 ) with suprime - cam @xcite at the subaru telescope in 2006 - 2009 .",
    "the field position and orientation are shown in figure [ fig : fc ] , and the observations are summarized in table [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the observed region was within 1 mpc from the center , which is less than half of the virial radius of the coma cluster ( 2.8 mpc ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we used three broadband filters ( b , r , i ) , and a narrowband filter ( n - a - l671 , hereafter ) .",
    "the nb - filter was designed for observing  emitting objects in the coma cluster at z=0.0225 , and has bell - shaped transmission with a central wavelength of 6712   and fwhm of 120  @xcite .",
    "the imaging data were reduced in a standard manner .",
    "overscan subtraction , flat - fielding , distortion correction , background subtraction and mosaicing were performed using another implementation ( nekosoft ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the standard suprime - cam reduction software .",
    "satellite trails and contaminated pixels with saturated photons were masked manually before mosaicing .",
    "the flux calibration was performed using the seventh data release ( * ? ? ? * hereafter dr7 ) of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) photometric catalog .",
    "the details are described in appendix [ sec : photocal ] .",
    "the limiting surface brightness and psf sizes of the final b , r , i , and   images are listed in table [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the limiting surface brightness was estimated by photometry of randomly sampled apertures 2 arcsec in diameter .",
    "we used the median of an absolute deviation ( mad ) multiplied by a factor @xmath11 as a robust estimator of the rms .",
    "the factor was calculated by solving erf(1/f)=3/4 @xmath12 and @xmath13mad equals to the rms , when the error followed a gaussian distribution .",
    "figure [ fig : nz ] shows the redshift distribution of galaxies brighter than @xmath14 mag within a radius of 2 degrees from the cluster center , and those in our observed field .",
    "redshifts were taken from sdss dr7 spectroscopic catalog . based on fig .",
    "[ fig : nz ] , we defined the galaxies with @xmath15z@xmath16 as coma member galaxies .",
    "to detect  clouds , we subtracted the r - band image from the  image . here , we refer to the r - band subtracted -band image as the  image .",
    "first , the typical @xmath17 color of coma members was estimated by multiplying the filter response to the sdss spectra of galaxies with @xmath15z@xmath16 .",
    "there are 395 galaxies in the redshift range with sdss spectra in our observed field .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : member_gr_rha ] , where @xmath17 color is plotted as a function of sdss color @xmath18 and suprime - cam color @xmath19 .",
    "as the @xmath17 is calculated from the sdss spectrum , we use fibermag for @xmath18 , which corresponds to the color of the central 3-arcsec aperture .",
    "the large dots represent the galaxies with equivalent width ew()@xmath510  in sdss .",
    "figure [ fig : member_gr_rha ] shows that the @xmath17 color of galaxies with ew()@xmath2010   correlates with the @xmath21 and @xmath22 color .",
    "the lines are the regression line for ew()@xmath201  galaxies : @xmath23 or @xmath24    this relation is useful in the analysis of emission line galaxies . the main purpose of this study , however , was to detect nebulous features , where neither @xmath21 information nor our @xmath22 color are necessarily available with a reliable s / n ratio .",
    "therefore , we used the median color of these member galaxies , @xmath17=0.065 mag , as the color of a typical coma passive galaxy , i.e. , a galaxy with no  emission .",
    "we scaled the r - band image so that such galaxies had values of 0 in the  image .",
    "as slight ( @xmath201 pix , 0.2 arcsec ) positional shifts between the r - band and -band remained in some regions , sub - pixel alignment was performed by the method of @xcite before subtraction .",
    "we also constructed a three - color image from b , r , and .",
    "the colors of the member galaxies in b , r , i , and in the suprime - cam filter system were calculated from sdss spectra .",
    "we adopted a scale such that those galaxies with @xmath22=1.0 , @xmath17=0.065 , and @xmath25=0.2 were gray in the three - color image .    in the  image",
    ", clouds were searched by visual inspection .",
    "ghosts of bright stars and residuals of background subtractions were carefully checked and excluded .",
    "the correlation of @xmath17  and color ( figure [ fig : member_gr_rha ] ) suggested that red galaxies would have residuals in the  image , while blue galaxies would have negative values .",
    "this point was verified using b and i - band data .",
    "if a region was bright in  and also red in the @xmath22 and @xmath26 colors , it was regarded as a residual .",
    "if the color was blue , however , it was regarded as a star - forming region , and was included in our sample of  clouds .",
    "all of the extended  clouds detected here are shown in figure [ fig : postage2374]-[fig : postage4232 ] and listed in table [ tab : parents ] .",
    "we named the clouds after possible associated galaxies ( hereafter , parent galaxies ) , using the galaxy ids of @xcite .",
    "the contrast of three - color composites ( left images ) was selected arbitrarily according to the brightness of the parent galaxy , while the color balance was fixed .",
    "a pure red color represented  emission without any stellar light , purple represented  emission with some stellar light , and blue color represented light from young blue stars without any  emission . in figures [ fig : postage3016 ] and [ fig : postage4060 ] , we can see blue filaments from the parent galaxy in the left image , while no  emission is present in the right image .",
    "these are the `` fireball '' features reported by @xcite .",
    "the contrast of the  image ( right images ) is the same for figures [ fig : postage2374]-[fig : postage4232 ] .",
    "therefore , the gray colors could be compared directly among the figures to measure the apparent  brightness .",
    "the green line in the  image represents the isophote of the -image at 2.5@xmath27 erg s@xmath28 @xmath29 arcsec@xmath30 , assuming that the clouds have the same redshift as the parent .",
    "the red contour represents the isophote of our r - band image , which was useful for comparing the extension of clouds with stellar light .",
    "the r - band isophote was chosen so that the region inside it contained the same area as the aperture of the r - band half light radius ( petror50 ) of sdss , because the bright galaxies in our r - band image had saturated pixels and we were not able to measure the radius in our data directly .",
    "in addition , the isophotal treatment was appropriate as the parents had distorted shapes .",
    "we performed spectroscopic observations of some of the clouds using the faint object camera and spectrograph ( focas , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in multi - object spectroscopy ( mos ) mode on 23 jun 2006 , and 19 may 2009 ut . the case of gmp2910(d100 ) was reported previously in @xcite .",
    "other cloud results the clouds will be described in yoshida et al .",
    "( in preparation ) . in this study , we used the spectroscopic result indicating that four clouds had similar redshifts to their respective parent galaxies ( gmp2559 , gmp2910 , gmp2923 , and gmp4060 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : postage2923 ] , gmp2945 , which lies just to the west of gmp2923 , apparent to be the parent of the clouds , but gmp2945 had a markedly different redshift ( z=0.0207 ) from the clouds ( z@xmath4 0.028 ) .",
    "we identified gmp2923(z=0.0291 ) as the parent and gmp2945 as a chance overlap .",
    "twelve of fourteen parent galaxies had sdss spectral information , and the other two had a hectospec redshift ( marzke , r.o , et al .",
    "2010 , in preparation ) .",
    "there were six galaxies that had both sdss and hectospec redshifts .",
    "they were consistent within @xmath4 30 km @xmath31 .",
    "table [ tab : clouds ] shows the extension of the  clouds relative to the parent galaxy and the surface brightness of the clouds measured in the  image .",
    "the  total flux was calculated by assuming that the cloud had the same redshift as the parent galaxy , and its mix of [ nii]6548,6583 was similar to that of the gmp2910 clouds @xcite .",
    "we adopted a value of [ nii]6583/=0.5 .",
    "other emission lines , such as [ oi]6300 and [ sii]6716,6731 , were out of the passband in the redshift of @xmath15z@xmath16 and were therefore negligible . as the wavelength dispersion of the emission lines of the gmp2910 cloud in the focas data was @xmath43.8 @xcite , we adopted a value for the model to compute the  flux .",
    "as it includes broadening by an instrumental profile , the value would be overestimated for  imaging data .",
    "however the effect of the dispersion was found to be negligible .",
    "the dispersion of 3.8  corresponded to velocity dispersion of @xmath32 km sec@xmath28 , but even if we assume a dispersion as 10 km sec@xmath28 , the change in  magnitude is less than 0.01 mag .",
    "we defined the  magnitude ( mag ( ) ) as the continuum subtracted  magnitude .",

    "we calculated the mag ( ) from the flux in the @xmath40 image with a zero - point -band magnitude .",
    "it should be noted that the  magnitude is not an @xmath40 color but the ab magnitude measured in the  image .",
    "that is , the @xmath40 color corresponds to ew ( ) , while  magnitude corresponds to l ( ) .",
    "the measurement of flux was performed in the fixed isophote of a smoothed image .",
    "the  image was smoothed with a gaussian kernel of @xmath41=2.5 pixel , so that the noise of each pixel was suppressed .",
    "the isophotal threshold for the analysis was set to 2.5@xmath27 erg s@xmath28 @xmath29 arcsec@xmath30 at the redshift of the parent galaxy . as the transmission of the  filter has a bell - shaped curve , the transmission at  changes according to the redshift .",
    "this effect was corrected when the threshold was calculated .",
    "the detected objects were examined with three - color images .",
    "possible overlapping objects , such as foreground stars , distant galaxies , or a redder galaxy core were removed manually . even after this screening , some of the clouds had errors due to the stellar color of the parent galaxy .",
    "in addition , some included light from hii regions in the parent galaxy .",
    "the examined detection map was used as a mask , and the total flux and peak surface brightness were measured in the masked  image .",
    "the same mask was applied to the r - band and the mean surface brightness in the r - band ( sb@xmath42 ) , which is an indicator of the extent of contamination of the  emission by continuum light , was measured .",
    "the measured values are summarized in table [ tab : clouds ] .",
    "the  clouds of gmp4017 lie along the line of the clouds of gmp4060 , and are slightly elongated in the north - south direction ( figure [ fig : gmp4017a ] ) .",
    "this implies that they may not be associated with gmp4017 , but with gmp4060 .",
    "if the gmp4017 clouds were in fact an extension of the gmp4060 clouds , the length of the gmp4060 cloud would be 144 kpc . as the redshift of gmp4017(0.0280 ) is similar to that of gmp4060(0.0292 ) , it is difficult to identify the physical association from spectroscopy .",
    "hi observations may uncover the origin of the clouds of gmp4017 .",
    "however , no hi emission has been detected around gmp4017 by previous deep hi surveys @xcite , with rms per channel of 0.20 - 0.40 mjy beam@xmath28 .",
    "although the survey covered the entire field of this study , there were only three parents in which hi gas was detected ( gmp2374 , gmp2559 , and gmp3779 ) .",
    "much deeper hi observations may be required to determine whether gmp4017 or gmp4060 is the true parent of the  clouds near gmp4017 .",
    "figure [ fig : fc2 ] shows the positions of the parents , the length and the position angle of the clouds projected onto the sky .",
    "the redshift relative to the coma cluster is also indicated as the color of the symbols .",
    "no clouds extend toward the center , although they do not always extend in the anti - center direction either .",
    "in addition , there is no apparent sub - clustering of the parents .",
    "figure [ fig : d_z ] shows the redshift of galaxies as a function of the distance from the cluster center .",
    "the position of ( @xmath10)=(12:59:42.8,+27:58:14 ) was adopted as the center of the cluster @xcite .",
    "this coordinate was used in our previous studies @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : d_z ] shows that most of these parent galaxies appear to reside in the blue and red edges of the redshift distribution , suggesting that the parents have large velocities relative to the coma cluster .",
    "we used the kolmogorov - smirnov(ks ) test to check whether the distribution of the peculiar velocity with respect to the cluster mean velocity was the same between the parents and the other member galaxies .",
    "the sample was restricted in the magnitude range @xmath2 and in our observed field to ensure unbiased samples . from the test ,",
    "the p - value for the null hypothesis that the two distributions are the same was calculated as 0.038 .",
    "therefore the distribution of the parents redshift if significantly different from that of other member galaxies with over 95% confidence .",
    "the parents are also located in the region farther than 0.2 mpc from the cluster center avoiding the cluster core .",
    "the difference in the distribution of distance was also examined by the ks test .",
    "the distribution of parent galaxies was different from that of other member galaxies ( p - value=0.045 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : d_z ] shows that only three parents lie on the blueshifted side while the rest lie on the redshifted side",
    ". the eleven redshifted parents could be part of a group falling into the cluster @xcite .",
    "however , we could not reject the possibility that the parents are falling into the cluster randomly from both sides , because the probability that either the redshifted or blueshifted group has less than 4 of 14 members is 5.7% , given the assumption of random infall .",
    "as the parent galaxies are bright , the centers of some of the galaxies were saturated in our subaru images .",
    "as the photometric data for these galaxies were not reliable , we took the photometric data from sdss dr7 .",
    "figure [ fig : colmag ] shows the color magnitude diagrams of the galaxies in our observed field .",
    "the filled circles represent the sdss galaxies with 0.015@xmath20z@xmath200.035 and r - band magnitude @xmath2018.0 .",
    "it is striking that more than half of the blue galaxies are parents of some  clouds .",
    "the color magnitude relation ( cmr ) of passive member galaxies in the coma cluster was fitted as @xmath43 if we define `` blue galaxies '' as those bluer by @xmath50.2 mag than the cmr the fraction of parents in the blue galaxies is 57% ( 8/14 ) in the @xmath4417.8 mag ( m@xmath45 ) sdss confirmed members .    in the sdss dr7 photometric catalog ,",
    "there are nine objects in our observed field which are classified as galaxies , have a `` blue '' color , are brighter than @xmath4417.8 mag , and have no sdss redshift .",
    "we checked the images of those objects and found that they consisted of three bright stars , one ghost of a bright object , two parts of other galaxies , and three galaxies .",
    "two of the three galaxies , gmp3016 and gmp4232 , are members , which is confirmed by hectospec spectroscopy , and had  tails as shown in fig 4 .",
    "the remaining one was part of the gmp2863 complex .",
    "gmp2863 consists of at least three components , which we call gmp2863a , gmp2863b , and gmp2863c ; of these , gmp2863b has a blue color in sdss .",
    "if gmp2863b is a member , the fraction of parents in the blue galaxies is 59%(10/17 ) ; if it is not , the fraction is 63%(10/16 ) .",
    "it should be noted that we used an apparent @xmath21 color in this analysis . as we did not correct for internal dust extinction of the parent galaxy in this study , their intrinsic color may be bluer .",
    "the distributions of  clouds around the parent ( fig [ fig : postage2374]-[fig : postage4232 ] ) were varied .",
    "we classified them into three types based on their appearance : 1 ) connected  clouds with disk star formations ; 2 ) connected  clouds without disk star formation ; and 3 ) detached  clouds .",
    "the results are listed in table [ tab : clouds ] .    *",
    "# 1 connected  clouds with disk star formation : * gmp2374 , gmp3271 , and gmp3816 show galaxy - wide star formation and some regions of  emission have flown out of the galaxies entirely .",
    "gmp3271 and gmp3816 are blue , while gmp2374 is as red as early - type galaxies and lies on the tip of the color - magnitude relation .",
    "nevertheless , gmp2374 exhibits a very clear spiral pattern with ongoing star formation at the arms .",
    "we suppose that gmp2374 could be a progenitor of a passive spiral galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "gmp2559 has negative  on the northern side , but strong  emission on the southern side .",
    "we also classified it as belonging to this type .    * # 2 connected  clouds without disk star formation : * gmp2910 , gmp3071 , and gmp3779 exhibit core star formation and extended  emission connected to the core .",
    "the extended clouds have a blobby structure .",
    "gmp3896 has a similar appearance to type # 1 , but with more extended emission in the disk .",
    "their color and magnitude are similar to those of type # 1 .    *",
    "# 3 detached  clouds : * gmp2923 , gmp3016 , gmp4060 , and gmp4232 have no apparent  emission in the parent galaxy , only outside the galaxy .",
    "the color of the parent is very blue ( @xmath46 ) , and the magnitude is very faint ( @xmath4716.8 ) .",
    "the four galaxies are in fact the four least luminous galaxies among the parents .",
    "gmp3016 and gmp4060 show fireball features :  emission following knots of young blue stars @xcite .",
    "the clouds of gmp4017 and gmp4156 are also detached .",
    "however , the emission is superimposed on the stellar component of the parent galaxy , and the parents are red .",
    "the clouds near the two giant galaxies could be different from those near the other four dwarfs .",
    "we classified gmp2923 , gmp3016 , gmp4060 , and gmp4232 as # 3 blue dwarfs , and gmp4017 and gmp4156 as # 3 red giants .",
    "the central @xmath48 excess of gmp4156 was partly due to the saturation of our r - band image and red color of stellar components , although  emission existed in the sdss spectrum of 3 arcsec aperture .",
    "the sdss spectrum showed a high [ nii]/  ratio of @xmath40.85 , which may indicate a weak active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "we noticed that all the # 3 blue dwarfs showed post - starburst signatures in their sdss / hectrospec spectra .",
    "as the fiber sizes were 3 arcsec ( 1.4 kpc ) and 1.5 arcsec ( 0.7 kpc ) for sdss and hectospec , respectively their central regions are in a post - starburst phase . moreover",
    ", none of the # 3 blue dwarfs were detected in deep radio 1.4ghz observations with the very large array ( vla ; * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that they now have little or no star formation even in their outer regions .",
    "meanwhile , 7 of 8 # 1 and # 2 parents were detected in radio ; these are star forming galaxies and not radio - loud agns .",
    "the findings presented in sections [ sec : result : pos ] and [ sec : result : color ] suggest that the parent galaxies were recently captured by the coma cluster potential and are now infalling toward the cluster center , while their disk gas is stripped off and seen as  clouds",
    ".    the classification based on apparent morphology may imply an evolutionary sequence of gas stripping : a star - forming disk galaxy ( # 1 ) evolves into star - forming + dead disk phase ( # 2 ) and then the gas clouds are detached ( # 3 ) .",
    "recent numerical simulations of ram - pressure stripping @xcite also showed the evolution of  appearance in @xmath4 500 myr .",
    "however , it is puzzling that # 3 phase galaxies consist of less luminous blue galaxies and bright red giants .",
    "moreover , gmp2374 , the brightest # 1 galaxy , shows a red color .",
    "although part of the red color is due to possible extinction by internal dust , the spectrum of the whole galaxy in the goldmine database @xcite indicates that it is dominated by intermediate and old stellar populations as inferred from its large d4000 and small cahk ratio .",
    "therefore it is difficult to assume that this galaxy will evolve into a post - starburst phase with a blue color .",
    "the parents may consist of several kinds of galaxies on different evolutionary paths .    as a second parameter of various evolutionary paths , we estimated the masses of the parents",
    ". higher mass galaxies should have larger potential wells and retain some gas for star formation , while lower mass galaxies might simply evolve from type # 1 to # 3 without passing through # 2 .",
    "the masses of the parents were estimated by three different methods and are given in table 4 .",
    "@xcite gives stellar mass - to - light ratios ( m / l ) as a function of color .",
    "they adopted a `` diet '' salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) , which has 30% lower mass than salpeter imf @xcite .",
    "we adopted @xmath49 and calculated the stellar mass from the sdss @xmath50 and @xmath51 magnitudes .",
    "we neglected k - correction for both the @xmath51 magnitude and @xmath52 colors , which were smaller than 0.1 mag .",
    "the possible effects of internal dust were also neglected .",
    "we also estimated the masses of the parents from the model sed fitting , using kcorrect v4.1.4 @xcite with sdss and public galex magnitudes and redshifts as in @xcite .",
    "the recommended corrections on the kcorrect web page were applied , which included the correction between the ab and sdss magnitudes , and the minimum uncertainty of the sdss magnitude .",
    "the kcorrect used @xcite imf and padova 1994 isochrones ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "yet another mass estimation was available in the mpa - jhu sdss catalog .",
    "the dr7_v5.2 version included 11 parents of this study .",
    "we adopted the `` median '' column as the estimated mass .",
    "the imf by @xcite was adopted for the catalog@xcite .",
    "although there were variations among the mass estimations of the three different methods , we can see that the type # 3 dwarfs had less than @xmath53 m@xmath54 . on the other hand ,",
    "the classification between # 1 and # 2 showed no clear correlation with mass .",
    "in addition , the lowest mass # 3 parents ( @xmath55 m@xmath54 ) stopped star formation quickly , while most of the # 1 and # 2 parents , the masses of which were @xmath56 m@xmath54 , continued star formation .",
    "the correlation of the detachment of the clouds , the activity of star formation , and the mass implied that the quick quench of the star formation in the # 3 blue dwarfs was due to shallow potentials and/or small amounts of gas .",
    "this result regarding the dependency of the star formation quench on the mass was similar to those in previous studies @xcite , although this is the first time that galaxies of low mass ( @xmath57 m@xmath54 ) have been investigated in this way .",
    "recently @xcite investigated uv and  images of the coma cluster , and listed the galaxies with gaseous stripping events ( gse ) , which were detected as uv asymmetries and had colors with @xmath58 .",
    "their observed field overlapped with our field , and there were six galaxies in common ( gmp2559 , gmp2910 , gmp3016 , gmp3816 , gmp4060 , and gmp4232 ) .",
    "it is striking that the uv asymmetric galaxies in our fields are only the six .",
    "this suggests that gse galaxies have extended  clouds with high probability .",
    "the other eight parents were not listed as gse galaxies , although all of the parents in this study satisfied the selection criteria of @xcite ( @xmath59 , and @xmath60z@xmath61 ) . as the nuv - optical color is a function of the star formation strength and the age since the last star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one possibility is that the non - gse parents are older .",
    "this can explain the red # 3 galaxies , as age quickly makes the @xmath21 color redder .",
    "the other five star - forming galaxies and a post - starburst galaxy have young stars , and the age can not explain the non - detection of uv asymmetry .",
    "it is possible that the uv asymmetric feature is faint because the star formation is / was weaker than other cases .",
    "it is also possible that the uv emitting stars have a symmetric distribution , while the  is asymmetric .",
    "the last case suggests that the distributions of the young stars and gas differ .",
    "the sign of the different distribution was shown in our previous studies @xcite .",
    "this also suggests that the source of ionization is not always the uv photons from young stars .",
    "a detailed discussion of the source of ionization will be presented in our next paper ( yoshida et al . in preparation ) .",
    "if we assume that all galaxies from which gas was removed experienced an  parent phase , we can speculate on the evolution of the parents .",
    "with regard to infalling galaxies , @xcite investigated two disk dwarf galaxies in the coma cluster , which still show spiral arm patterns .",
    "the galaxies , gmp3292 and gmp3629 , are thought to be transforming from spiral to passive galaxies .",
    "@xcite also noted that these galaxies have large peculiar velocities relative to the coma center .",
    "however , these two galaxies are , much redder than parents in this study ( @xmath62 for gmp3292 and @xmath63 for gmp3629 ) , but are of comparable mass ( 4.1@xmath64 and 8@xmath65 m@xmath66 ) , with values estimated in the same way as for the parents .",
    "they might be recently evolved shapes from the parents , as they still retain the arm pattern .",
    "from the suprime - cam observation of the center of the coma cluster , we found ionized  clouds near 14 galaxies ( parents ) .",
    "all the parents were confirmed to be coma member galaxies by sdss and hectospec spectroscopy .",
    "the parent galaxies were distributed in the region farther than 0.2 mpc from the cluster center , and tended to reside on the blue and red edges of the redshift distribution , avoiding the mean cluster redshift .",
    "the majority of the parent galaxies were blue , and 57% of the blue galaxies brighter than @xmath14 contained  clouds .",
    "we classified the connection between the parent and the clouds into three types : connected clouds with disk star formation , connected clouds without disk star formation , and detached clouds .",
    "the parents of detached clouds consisted of two groups ; blue dwarfs and red giants .",
    "the blue dwarfs were the four least luminous galaxies among the 14 parents , and showed no sign of current star formation but appeared to be post - starburst .",
    "the parents with connected clouds showed no significant differences regardless of whether they had disk star formation or not .    a comparison with galaxies with uv asymmetries showed that all such galaxies are accompanied with  clouds .",
    "this suggests that a galaxy undergoing a gaseous stripping event has extended  emitting clouds with high probability .",
