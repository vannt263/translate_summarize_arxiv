    "one of the most vexing problems in the classification of surfaces of general type is the fact that we are not yet able to classify surfaces with the smallest possible invariants @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "such surfaces are usually called ( numerical ) godeaux surfaces @xcite .",
    "nowadays the moduli space of surfaces of general type comes with a modular compactification , the moduli space of stable surfaces @xcite .",
    "the stable surfaces occurring in the compactification can be used to gain insight in the classical moduli space but are also interesting in their on right .",
    "this article grew out of two motivations : first of all we hoped to give a new construction of some godeaux surfaces by smoothing stable godeaux surfaces in the spirit of @xcite but starting with a gorenstein surface .",
    "secondly , in our study of pluricanonical maps of stable surfaces @xcite we were looking for examples of gorenstein stable surfaces with @xmath4 not very ample ; so it was natural to study some examples with small invariants .",
    "both motivations lead us to the construction described in section [ sect : surface ] where from any general smooth del pezzo surface of degree 1 we construct a ( gorenstein ) stable godeaux surface , that is a gorenstein stable surface @xmath0 with @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we also show that @xmath0 is topologically simply connected and compute its integral homology .",
    "it turns out that our first hope was futile : the surfaces we construct are far away from any smooth surfaces .",
    "let @xmath0 be a stable godeaux surface of the type constructed in section [ sect : surface ] .",
    "then the kuranishi space of @xmath0 is smooth of dimension 8 and all deformations are locally trivial .",
    "such surfaces form an irreducible open subset of the moduli space @xmath5 of stable surface with @xmath6 , which has at most finite quotient singularities .",
    "the proof of theorem a will be given in section [ sect : proof ] . the key point is the explicit control over infinitesimal deformations in section [ sect : deformations ] , where we have to overcome the annoying fact that we are handling local normal crossing surfaces which do not have global normal crossings .",
    "in section [ sect : 3 ] we will concentrate on one explicit example and compute , with the help of a computer algebra system , its canonical ring . the result is a rather complicated ring , gorenstein in codimension ten , but it is generated in degree up to 5 and , in particular , @xmath4 is very ample .",
    "in fact , one can show directly that the latter property is true for all surfaces in our family @xcite .    in principle",
    ", it would be possible to study degenerations of our examples via the del pezzo surfaces , however it is unclear if in this way one would be able to connect to a known component of the moduli space of godeaux surfaces .",
    "starting from the results in @xcite one can actually classify gorenstein stable godeaux surfaces with worse than canonical singularities .",
    "these will be studied in a forthcoming joint paper with marco franciosi and rita pardini .",
    "we are indebted to marco franciosi , rita pardini , and wenfei liu for many discussions on stable surfaces .",
    "we also enjoyed discussing different aspects of this project with olivier benoist , anne frbis - krger , roberto pignatelli , miles reid , helge ruddat , and timo schrg .",
