    "the euler equations of inviscid incompressible fluid admit simple steady solutions known as the shear flows . such solutions ( in the cartesian coordinates )",
    "are written in the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the velocity field , @xmath2 denote the pressure , and @xmath3 is referred to as the flow profile .",
    "generally , function @xmath3 can be chosen arbitrarily but we restrict our considerations within the case of smooth @xmath4periodic profiles .",
    "for such flows , we study 2d spatially periodic perturbations using the linear approximation .",
    "let @xmath5 denote the stream function for the velocity perturbation ; hence the instant velocity of the perturbed flow is @xmath6 then the linear equation for perturbations takes the form @xmath7 since eq .",

    "following to @xcite and @xcite , we look for such instability in the case of rapidly oscillating basic flow .",
    "let us consider profile @xmath14 , where @xmath15   smooth @xmath16-periodic in @xmath17 , and @xmath18 with integer @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "let us seek for the solutions of in the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is integer and @xmath23 is unknown @xmath16-periodic function . substituting into yields equation for @xmath23 : @xmath24 where operator @xmath25 is defined by @xmath26 accent means differentiation by variable @xmath17 .",
    "we construct the asymptotic for the unstable eigenvalues @xmath12 in the case of @xmath27 .",
    "our approach follows to that of @xcite and @xcite . in more details , let us write the problem ( [ ishodnaya ] ) in the form @xmath28 assuming that @xmath29 when @xmath30 we get @xmath31 eq . has periodic solution @xmath32 for every @xmath33 . to make this solution unique ( up to the constant factor @xmath34 )",

    "it should be noted that function @xmath45 has been introduced originally in @xcite in order to formulate the necessary condition for the long - wave instability of the channel flows .",
    "however , the result of @xcite exploits the monotonicity of the shear flow profile that makes it inapplicable to the oscillating flows . at the same time , the asymptotic we found can be considered as long - wave one since the problem ( [ vved0 ] ) in fact depends on @xmath46 only when @xmath47 .",
