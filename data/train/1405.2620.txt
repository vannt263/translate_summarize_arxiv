    "mips 24@xmath74 m imaging . among them , only one is clearly detected .",
    "visual inspection of the morphologies show that most of them are spatially extended ( @xmath75 or 1.2 ) and not dominated by a point source component that may suggest the presence of an agn .",
    "two have existing rest - frame uv spectra @xcite , but neither shows c  iv or n  v emission indicative of agn .",
    "we therefore conclude that the contamination of the lae candidate population by luminous agn is not significant .",
    "some guidance may also be found from other work .",
    "@xcite , whose survey is the closest match to ours in terms of redshift and imaging depth , did not find any clear evidence of contamination in their @xmath76 lae spectroscopic sample . after similar narrow - band searches of laes around high - redshift radio galaxies and their spectroscopic followup",

    "what follows , we use the spatial distribution of laes to estimate overdensities ; any low-@xmath78 interloper contamination , if randomly distributed , will result in an underestimate of the true overdensity .",
    "in this section , we discuss the angular distribution of the galaxies within the field .",
    "we consider two samples separately : ( 1 ) the 65 lae candidates supplemented by the spectroscopically confirmed galaxies ( which adds one extra galaxy to this subset ) ; and ( 2 ) the 428 lbg galaxy candidates .",
    "the distributions of these two subsets are shown in the left panel of figure [ distribution ] .",
    "the lae distribution within the field ( which covers a volume of @xmath2  mpc at @xmath49 ; figure [ distribution ] ) is highly inhomogeneous . in particular , there are three regions ( denoted as `` ne '' , `` nw '' , and `` s '' groups ) each containing @xmath79 laes within a 8  mpc ( or 3.8 ) radius circle . given the observed average lae surface density in this field of 0.057  arcmin@xmath59 ( @xmath80 ) , the expected number of laes within a 3.8  radius circle is @xmath81 . hence , these three regions have surface densities that are factors of @xmath82 higher than the average in this field , or surface overdensities of @xmath83 . since the average surface density measured in this field is likely biased by the presence of the structures ( see  4.2 ) , these are underestimates of the true surface overdensities .",
    "the three groups lie @xmath84  comoving  mpc ( i.e. , @xmath85  mpc physical ) apart from one another ( in projection ) , and appear to be connected by filaments traced by the lae distribution .",
    "the three spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at @xmath86 ( shown as blue crosses without red circles ) near the s group may trace a filament running along line of sight .",
    "there are also regions devoid of any lae candidates ( in the northern and central regions and the southeast corner ) .",
    "these areas have comparable photometric depth to the regions in which galaxy overdensities are found , and are not significantly affected by the object mask ( see right panel of figure  [ distribution ] ) .",
    "hence , the observed inhomogeneity of the galaxy distribution is likely real .",
    "five of the six highest line - luminosity sources discussed in ",
    "[ lae_selection ] ( the large black circles in figure  [ distribution ] , left ) lie within or near the three overdense groups : two in the ne group ; two in the s group ; and one just north of the s group , where there is a concentration of four laes .",
    "only one of the six resides far from the galaxy overdensities northeast of the s group .",
    "the distribution of lbg candidates also appears highly inhomogeneous .",
    "a large number of lbgs are observed at the southern edge of the field near ( but not coincident with ) the s group . within the 24@xmath876  area (",
    "dashed grey line in figure  [ distribution ] left ) , there are 83 lbgs , 50% larger in number than that expected from the observed field average ( i.e. , @xmath88 ; see   [ lbg_selection ] ) .    to better visualize and quantify the angular distribution of laes and lbgs , we create two - dimensional density maps of the field .",
    "we first apply a gaussian kernel of fwhm=10  mpc ( i.e. , characteristic radius of 4.25  mpc ) independently to the positional map of the 65 lae candidates and that of the 428 lbg candidates ( see figure  [ structure_map ] ) .",
    "the contours show the relative local density with respect to the field .",
    "the discussion of the lae field density estimate is given in ",
    "[ overdensity_estimate ] . for the lbgs",
    ", we assume the observed lbg surface density as the field average .",
    "the locations of the three high - overdensity regions , discussed in  [ galaxy_distribution ] and shown in figure [ distribution ] , are apparent in the lae density map .",
    "each group resides in a region with the surface density at the core @xmath89 the field average .",
    "the s group is the most significant overdensity , containing 9 laes and 3 additional spectroscopic members .",
    "a smaller , compact group of laes lies @xmath906  ( @xmath9012.6 comoving mpc ; 2.6 physical mpc ) to the north .",
    "we varied the smoothing scales to test the robustness of the overdensity regions . while the overall morphology of the lae density map changes slightly depending on the smoothing scale ,",
    "all three groups are recovered with smoothing scales between @xmath91  mpc .    despite the broader redshift distribution resulting from the lbg selection criteria ,",
    "the lbg density map shows a striking resemblance to that derived for the laes .",
    "the two regions of highest lbg density are located in or near the s and ne lae groups .",
    "the lae and lbg distributions associated with the s group are slightly offset from each other , with the lbg surface density forming an elongated structure extending nearly 3  mpc ( physical ) away from the peak of the lae surface density .",
    "the nw group of laes also resides in a region where the lbg density is @xmath92 that of the `` field '' .",
    "the density contour around the s group of lbgs extends northward , mirroring the distribution of laes .",
    "the morphology of lbg density in the region between the nw and s group is also similar to that observed in the lae map .",
    "these similarities lend support to the idea that these are coherent structures in the galaxy distribution .",
    "one notable difference between the lbg and lae maps is the presence of a large population of lbgs in the southeast corner of the field ( @xmath93 the field ) ; no laes are observed there .",
    "differences of this nature might suggest that these are regions where the lbg redshifts ( and the dominant structure ) do not fall within the lae redshift selection window , but are either foreground or background structures .",
    "the line - of - sight distances sampled by lbg and lae candidates are vastly different : the front - to - back comoving distance of the lae sample is @xmath94  mpc , just @xmath95% of that for the lbg sample , i.e. , 480 ( 640 )  mpc , assuming @xmath96 around @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the spatial density distributions of the two candidate populations resemble each other , and do not appear to be affected by any spatially varying selection criteria .",
    "the close resemblance of the two distribution lends strong support to the fact that many of the lbg candidates must be part of the large - scale structure traced by the laes , and that the discovered structure genuinely represents highly significant matter density peaks traced by both laes and lbgs . in the section that follows ,",
    "we attempt to quantify the overdensities and predict their present - day descendants .      in hierarchical galaxy formation theory ,",
    "cluster formation takes place in the most highly overdense regions .",

    ", the total mass associated with each of the observed galaxy overdensities is @xmath140 , @xmath141 , and @xmath142 for the ne , nw , and s group , respectively .",
    "these values are higher than or close to the upper end of the mass estimate according to the @xcite calibration .",
    "the main reason is because the chiang et al .",
    "calibration assumed the galaxy bias of @xmath143 while we used the value @xmath144 , directly measured from the data ( see appendix ) .",
    "adopting their bias value returns the total masses closer to the chiang et al .",
    "estimates ; i.e. , @xmath145 , @xmath141 , and @xmath140 for the ne , nw , and s group , respectively .",
    "galaxy bias ( hence , conversion from galaxy overdensity to matter overdensity ) remains the largest uncertainty in our mass estimate .    in summary",

    "* their table  4 ) estimate that the regions with @xmath148 have @xmath149% probability to evolve into a galaxy cluster by @xmath9 .",
    "our mass estimates suggest that the nw group will evolve into a fornax - like cluster ( @xmath150 ) , while the two more significant groups will evolve into virgo - like clusters ( @xmath151 ) .",
    "the mass of the s group is nearly @xmath152 ; if the overdensity extends further south , it is possible that its final mass may be even larger comparable to that of the coma cluster ( k .- s .",
    "lee , et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "we now consider the probability of finding _ three _ overdensities so close to one another .",
    "this is related to the expected number density of a single protocluster in our volume . according to @xcite ,",
    "the number of protoclusters identified to have @xmath153 at @xmath9 is 2,832 in a comoving box of 500  mpc  @xmath154 on a side .",
    "hence , the expected number within our survey volume ( @xmath155 ) is almost exactly one .",
    "we expect that the number of galaxy clusters in the wmap7 cosmology , as assumed here , is slightly larger . ]",
    "( i.e. , @xmath156 ) .",
    "an independent estimate from the mass function of x - ray clusters gives a similar answer for the comoving space density @xcite .",
    "given that the expected number is only one , what is the significance of an overdensity of 3 within a @xmath157 volume ?",
    "we estimate this by randomly sampling the millennium runs volume ( assuming the wmap7 cosmology ) on scales of our survey box ( y .- k .",
    "chiang , in private communication ) . of @xmath158 trials within the @xmath159 volume",
    ", we find 2,800 cases in which three or more protoclusters are included in the box .",
    "hence , the probability of finding three or more protoclusters _ of any mass _ within our volume is @xmath160% .",
    "if we restrict the results to only groups where the total mass in protoclusters within the survey box is at least @xmath161 , the probability decreases to 1.9% .",
    "similarly , the probability of finding three or more protoclusters within our survey volume where the most massive protocluster has a total mass of @xmath162 is 1.7 ( 1.2 , 0.9)% . in short , the chances of finding three overdensities matching our observational constraints within the survey volume are very low , @xmath163% .",
    "we would only expect to make _ one _ such discovery if we carried out the lae narrow - band survey to the same depth over @xmath164  deg@xmath12 !",
    "this structure may be one of the largest overdensities , both in size and density , observed thus far .",
    "although the protocluster candidates will likely virialize by @xmath9 , the filamentary structures are unlikely to do so .",
    "these filamentary regions will likely continue to evolve , perhaps becoming highly biased structures similar to local superclusters .",
    "the separation between the three overdensities is comparable to the size of a supercluster in its longest dimension ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "most extreme cases of such structures are known as `` great walls '' in the local universe @xcite . to further elaborate on this hypothesis",
    ", we need to firmly establish the physical association between different groups , which will require both larger areal coverage and kinematic information from spectroscopy .    finally , we checked the literature to find similarly massive structures containing multiple galaxy overdensities in the volume similar to our field .",
    "most notably , @xcite searched the 2  deg@xmath12 cosmos field using the photometric redshift technique , and identified 36 protocluster candidates at @xmath165 ( see their table  1 ) .",
    "while we do not find any structure containing three protoclusters , there are @xmath166 cases where two candidates are within @xmath167  deg and @xmath168 from each other .",
    "these structures lie at @xmath169 , and typically have @xmath170 .",
    "the relatively low value for the observed overdensity is mainly due to the ` dilution ' caused by the photometric redshift uncertainty of typically @xmath171 in identifying these structures ( equivalent to @xmath172 larger line - of - sight distance than our lae survey ) . based on their simulations covering @xmath173 the cosmos volume ,",
    "@xcite estimated that the probability of any of these candidate protoclusters to evolve into a coma - like cluster ( @xmath174 ) is low , @xmath175 .",
    "based on the number of protocluster pairs found by @xcite , it is possible to independently estimate the likelihood of finding more than one protocluster within our survey volume . over the 1.62  deg@xmath12 area , they found four pairs with @xmath176  deg separation and @xmath177 .",
    "the comoving volume between @xmath178 and @xmath179 is 0.0196  gpc@xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the comoving number density of protocluster pairs is 126  gpc@xmath180 ( @xmath181 ) .",
    "since our survey volume is @xmath2  mpc@xmath182  gpc@xmath3 , the expected number of a protocluster pair within our survey volume is 0.016 .",
    "the estimated likelihood of @xmath183% is likely a conservative limit because the botes structure contains three protoclusters ; no triplet is found in the cosmos protocluster sample . while more detailed comparison between the botes structure and those found in the cosmos field is not possible ( chiang et al .",
    "did not publish mass estimates for their candidates ) , it is assuring that the probability of finding multiple protoclusters in our survey volume is low at just a few percent based on both simulations and real data .",
    "these considerations strongly suggest that the botes structure represents one of the rarest overdensity regions with few known counterparts in the high - redshift universe .",
    "in this paper , we report the discovery of a large - scale structure consisting of three massive galaxy overdensities within a @xmath184 comoving volume at @xmath0 .",
    "deep imaging of the region taken with narrow- and broad - band filters reveal that the number of lyman - alpha emitting galaxies ( or laes ) is @xmath185% higher than that expected in field environments .",
    "the laes in the field show a highly unusual angular distribution ( figure [ distribution ] and [ structure_map ] ) ; three separate regions are observed with a surface overdensity , @xmath186 , of @xmath187 or higher within a 8  mpc radius circle .",
    "these galaxy groups are separated about @xmath188  mpc , and appear to be connected by filaments along which more laes reside .",
    "the distribution of lbgs in the same field resembles that of laes , even though the lbgs sample a factor of 20 - 25 larger line - of - sight distance than laes ; this suggests that these overdensities are indeed massive structures containing both laes and lbgs .",
    "the most significant overdensity lies at the extreme southern end of our image , suggesting that the true extent of this structure may extend beyond the current data .    among 65 laes",
    ", we find six sources with high line - luminosity ( @xmath62 , implying @xmath189 ) .",
    "all but one of these high line - luminosity sources reside within or in the vicinity of one of the three galaxy overdensities .",
    "none of the 6 are detected at x - ray wavelengths , and the two that have been observed spectroscopically show no rest - frame uv signatures of agn .",
    "hence , our data suggest that ly@xmath8 emission in these sources may be powered by massive star formation rather than by agn .",
    "recent galaxy simulations demonstrate that at the level of the observed overdensities , these structures will likely be virialized by @xmath9 and become galaxy clusters with masses @xmath190 @xcite .",
    "we estimate that one of the three galaxy groups will have the total mass of @xmath191 and the other two groups will grow in the range of @xmath192",
    ". if the galaxy bias is lower than that assumed in the simulations , the final masses may be even larger . a direct estimate based on the sizes of the overdensities and measured galaxy bias in the region",
    "returns that the total masses enclosed within these regions may be as large as @xmath193 for the two smaller groups , and @xmath194 for the largest one .",
    "given the relatively large distances between these groups ( @xmath195  mpc ) , it is unlikely that all three groups will merge into a single virialized structure by @xmath9 .",
    "nevertheless , it is rare to find three highly significant overdensities so close to one another .",
    "the millennium simulation ( volume @xmath196 billion mpc@xmath3 ) suggests that the probability of chance alignment of three ( or more ) protoclusters within our survey volume ( @xmath197 ) is @xmath1982% ( based on our conservative mass limits given in  [ overdensity_estimate ] ) . an independent estimate based on the existing samples of protocluster candidates at high redshift returned a consistently low likelihood .",
    "hence , it appears that we have discovered one of the densest regions of the high - redshift universe with scales well beyond @xmath199  mpc in its longest dimension , similar to the value observed for some of the local superclusters .",
    "further insight into the true extent and kinematic state of this structure , which will help us better assess its ultimate future , will require wider - field imaging data and spectroscopic followup .",
    "identifying a statistical sample of very large structures and their constituents will provide a unique opportunity to study the early evolution of the universe",
    ". we will be able to study the early stages of galaxy formation in different local environments ; from voids , to filaments , to the highest overdensity regions .",
    "measurements of the space density of the protoclusters , and the galaxy distribution within these structures will directly test the theory of structure formation .",
    "unfortunately , such large galaxy overdensities are extremely rare at high redshift and thus are unlikely to be found in large number from deep , small - area surveys . targeted searches over much wider fields ( @xmath200  deg@xmath12 ) will be key to identifying a statistical sample .",
    "ongoing wide - field imaging surveys such as dark energy survey , or future surveys with the large synoptic survey telescope , may provide a sound basis for selecting candidate protoclusters to be targeted .",

    "cell variance can be easily predicted for any representative galaxy population ( or dark matter ) at any redshift and provides a powerful tool to characterize the large - scale environments in direct comparison with other known galaxy samples .",
    "we define the relative cell variance @xmath201 as : @xmath202 where the first term is the total rms fluctuation in the number of galaxies found in a cell , and the second term accounts for the same quantity arising from the poisson shot noise .",
    "ideally , we want to measure cell variance in a spherical volume . without redshift information of individual sources ,",
    "it is not possible to pinpoint the lae positions in the line - of - sight direction . because the evolution of clustering along the line - of - sight in our volume is negligible , the cell variance measured in a cylindrical volume should be as good as that measured in a sphere of the same volume .",
    "we measure cell variance by counting galaxies within a circle with radius 10  mpc at random positions in our field .",
    "the volume sampled by the 10  mpc circle is the same as that of a sphere of radius @xmath203  mpc ( = 11.4  mpc in the adopted cosmology ) .",
    "we correct the observed counts to account for the area lost to masked regions as @xmath204 , where @xmath205 is the fraction of the total area that is masked out ; we exclude measurements where the loss is more than 60% as unreliable . when averaged over the corrected number counts made over 1000 random trials , we recover the field - averaged surface density within 3% .",
    "we measure @xmath206 for our sample .",
    "the power spectrum normalization for the adopted cosmology is @xmath207 , i.e. , the relative fluctuation of matter at @xmath9 within a @xmath208 radius sphere . in the linear regime , density perturbations grow by a factor of 3.64 from @xmath49 to @xmath9 .",
    "( see equation  19 of @xcite ) ; i.e. , matter fluctuation is @xmath209 .",
    "hence , we estimate that galaxy bias for our laes is @xmath210 ( @xmath211/0.22 $ ] ) .",
    "our value is consistent with the bias estimated from clustering measurements of field laes @xcite , but is slightly lower than the predictions from galaxy simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
