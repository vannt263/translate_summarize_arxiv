    "recently , a second hst deep field has been observed in the southern hemisphere ( hdf - s ; williams et al .",
    "1999 , in preparation ) .",
    "the stis field was chosen to contain the qso j2233606 ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ; boyle 1997 ) .",
    "both deep imaging of the qso field and spectroscopy of the qso itself have been obtained ( gardner et al . 1999 , ferguson et al .",
    "1999 ) . low- and high - dispersion spectra from ground - based telescopes are also already available ( outram et al . 1998 ,",
    "savaglio 1998 , sealey et al .",
    "this set of data offers a unique opportunity to address important questions related to the connection between galaxies and qso absorption lines , including the absorption cross - section of faint galaxies and the structure of the inter - galactic medium over the redshift range 1.22.2 .",
    "spectroscopy of the brightest galaxies in the full hdf - s , selected from our @xmath14-band ground - based image , has been performed on the eso - ntt by a collaboration assembled under the auspices of a european training and mobility of researchers ( tmr ) network . here",
    "we comment on the galaxies closest to j2233606 and discuss their possible relation with spectral features of j2233606 .",
    "briefly presents the target selection , observation and data reduction , with emphasis on objects close to j2233606 . in sect .",
    "3 we analyse their relevance to absorption lines in the j2233606 spectrum . in sect .",
    "4 we draw our conclusions . throughout the paper ,",
    "we adopt @xmath15 and @xmath3 .",
    "a 30mn equivalent @xmath14-band image centered on j2233606 was obtained in the eso director s discretionary time with the emmi - ntt red - imaging channel and made available to us for target selection .",
    "photometric calibration has been done with standard stars from landolt ( 1992 ) and the accuracy of the zero point is better than 0.1 magnitude .",
    "source extraction and star - galaxy separation were performed with sextractor ( bertin & arnouts , 1996 ) resulting in a catalogue of 1159 objects with @xmath16 complete at the 90% level .",
    "the us naval observatory catalogue was used as reference for the astrometry .",
    "this gives an accuracy close to 1  for absolute positions and about three times better for relative positions within the field .",
    "multi - slit spectroscopy has been carried out with emmi where about thirty objects can be observed simultaneously .",
    "we used slits of 1.02 or 1.34  in width , leading to a spectral resolution of fwhm  @xmath17  10.6 or 13.9  .",
    "the spectral range lies within 390010000   but its actual length depends on the location of the object within the mask .",
    "reduction was done with standard techniques using an updated version of multired under the iraf reduction package .",
    "the residuals of the wavelength calibration fits have an r.m.s . of less than 0.7  , but the positioning of the objects relative to the slit was accurate to @xmath180.3 , leading to wavelength uncertainties of order 3  .",
    "the accuracy in measuring the wavelengths of lines in the galaxy spectra is close to one tenth of the resolution element , i.e. 1 . to 1.4  .",
    "thus the redshift accuracy is mainly limited by the position of the galaxies within the slits , and our redshifts are accurate to about 0.001 .",
    "spectra were flux calibrated using standard stars from stone & baldwin ( 1984 ) with no attempt to correct here for aperture losses .",
    "full details of observations of the complete sample , data reductions and measured parameters are in dennefeld et al .",
    "( 1999 , in preparation ) .",
    "galaxies for which we have performed spectroscopy are shown by a filled circle in fig .",
    "those galaxies lying within 1  of j2233606 are listed in table  [ tab1 ] two of which are of particular interest : q433 ( j2233415603255 ) is another qso , and g486 ( j2233378603324 ) is a spiral galaxy at only 4.7from j2233606 .",
    "their spectra are displayed in fig .",
    "the redshift of q433 , @xmath19 , is determined from the broad mgii @xmath202799 and ciii ] @xmath201909 emission lines . also seen",

    "the observed ( v@xmath22i ) spectral index is 0.5 ; using the corresponding spectral energy distribution gives @xmath23 .",

    "nv @xmath201242 absorption could be present at @xmath62 km s@xmath47 .",

    "an absorption line is seen at the expected position of ovi  @xmath201031 but with no obvious ovi @xmath201037 counterpart ; the corresponding part of the spectrum has a poor s / n ratio however .",
    "the presence of metals in the cloud is thus questionable ; better data in the optical range will help decide this issue",
    ".    the good correspondence between the redshift of q433 and the lyman absorption redshift in the j2233606 spectrum ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 km s@xmath47 ) might only be coincidence",
    ". the absorption could in fact be due to gas associated with an object in the qso s immediate environment .",
    "we note that the number density of ly@xmath4 lines with @xmath49hi@xmath65 @xmath11 is about 5 per unit redshift ( petitjean et al . 1993 ) . assuming no dependence on redshift , the probability that a randomly placed ly@xmath4 cloud with @xmath49hi@xmath65 @xmath11 is observed within 200 km s@xmath47 from the redshift of q433 along the line of sight to j2233606 is smaller than 0.01 .",
    "this probability is not highly significant since it is an a - posteriori statistical argument .",
    "note that savaglio et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have shown that the region spanning @xmath661.460 has a low density of absorption lines with five lines detected when 16 are expected from the average density along the line of sight .",
    "this possible ` transverse proximity effect ' is at odds with the presence of the strong line at the same redshift as q433 .",
    "a similar situation has been observed along the lines of sight to q10260045a , b , two qsos at @xmath67 and 1.520 respectively , with an angular separation of 36 , corresponding to an impact parameter of @xmath68 kpc ( petitjean et al .",
    "a metal - poor associated system is seen at @xmath69 along the line of sight to a , with a complex velocity profile .",
    "a strong ly@xmath4 absorption is detected along the line of sight to b , redshifted by only 300 km s@xmath47 relative to the associated system in a.    follow - up spectroscopic studies of the field will investigate whether this qso / absorption association is a consequence of the presence of a gaseous disk , halo or other gaseous structure of radius larger than 200@xmath70 kpc around q433 or is due to a galaxy at a similar redshift to q433 .      the line of sight to j2233606 passes through the disk ( seen approximatively face - on ) of a late - type spiral galaxy at an impact parameter of only @xmath72 kpc .",
    "this is a situation where conspicuous metal absorptions , and perhaps damped hi ly@xmath4 , are expected .",
    "hi absorption associated with this galaxy is seen in the lyman series ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) at @xmath73 .",
    "uncertainties are too large to reliably estimate the column density from fitting the lines",
    ". however , the fit of the lyman limit ( 912 ) gives @xmath49hi@xmath74 @xmath11 ( outram , private communication ) . because of the poor spectral resolution of the g140l spectrum , the presence of ciii @xmath20977 and cii @xmath201036 can not be ruled out , and the civ and aliii doublets are most certainly blended .",
    "there is no feii @xmath202600 absorption at @xmath204083.3 in the aat spectrum ( outram et al .",
    "1998 ) down to a 3@xmath75 limit @xmath76  .",
    "the lack of feii absorption is consistent with a low hi column density .",
    "note that feii @xmath202382 is lost in a strong ly@xmath4 complex .    it is well established that bright ( @xmath77 ) galaxies within 40@xmath70 kpc from the line of sight to a qso produce strong ( @xmath78  ) mgii absorption ( e.g. bergeron & boiss 1991 , steidel et al .",
    "1994 ) whereas fainter galaxies with a similar range of impact parameters do not produce detectable metal - line absorptions ( steidel et al .",
    "1997 ) . in the present case ,",
    "a weak absorption line at @xmath204390.66 is detected both in the aat spectrum and in a spectrum recently obtained at eso ( v. dodorico et al .",

    "this line is probably mgii @xmath202796 at @xmath80 .",
    "the limit on the corresponding weaker mgii @xmath202803 line is consistent with the optically thin case .",
    "the mgii absorption is quite weak for a galaxy with @xmath28 and such a small impact parameter : this is inconsistent with the correlation between the impact parameter and the strength of the absorption claimed by lanzetta & bowen ( 1990 ) .",
    "a single component mgii system is seen at @xmath81 @xmath82 km",
    "s@xmath47 and @xmath83 mg  ii@xmath84 ( outram et al . 1998 ) .",
    "we observe two galaxies at a distance smaller than 40  ( or 130@xmath70 kpc ) from j2233606 at redshifts @xmath85 and 0.4148 , ( g1096 and g496 in table  [ tab1 ] ) , while a third one with @xmath86 ( g1109 ) is slightly outside the 1  radius ( @xmath87 ) . the well - defined @xmath14-band selected cfrs redshift distribution gives 0.38@xmath880.02 and 0.52@xmath880.04 galaxies at @xmath89 by square arcmin in the respective redshift ranges [ 0.300.40 ] and [ 0.400.50 ] ( see lilly et al .",
    "thus the three galaxies observed in a 0.0001 redshift range represent a density far in excess of the expected mean .",
    "this overdensity of galaxies at @xmath90 suggests that other objects closer to the qso are responsible for the absorption .",
    "a possible candidate is object g484 ( see fig .",

    "this is consistent with the halo radius - luminosity scaling - law found for mgii absorption - selected galaxies ( bergeron & boiss 1991 , steidel et al .",
    "we have carried out spectroscopic observations of galaxies around j2233606 and searched for associated absorption - line systems in its spectrum .",

    "strong hi ly@xmath4 and    ly@xmath5 absorptions are seen at    @xmath6 in the spectrum of j2233606 . the    good redshift agreement might be coincidence ; however a similar case    has already been observed by petitjean et al .",
    "further    investigations are needed to decide whether a group of galaxies    associated with q433 or a structure of radius larger than    200@xmath70 kpc around q433 is responsible for the hi    absorption .",
    "( ii ) : :    the nearly face - on sc spiral ( j2233378603324 ;    @xmath7 ,    @xmath95 ,    @xmath96 kpc ) is an excellent target for    associated absorption - line system studies .",
    "we find absorption in the    lyman series .",
    "the associated lyman limit , and the absence of feii in    the j2233606 spectrum are consistent with a hi column density of less    than 10@xmath97 @xmath11 .",
