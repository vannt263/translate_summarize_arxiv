    "the fluxes of @xmath1 and @xmath2 from a core - collapse supernova ( sn ) can encode very interesting information about both the ( anti)neutrino properties @xcite and the sn explosion mechanism @xcite .",
    "assuming that the latter is understood , one may try to detect distinctive features of flavor change in either the energy ( @xmath3 ) or time ( @xmath4 ) spectra of the observable fluxes @xmath5 , as compared with the `` featureless , '' unoscillated fluxes @xmath6 , for one or more neutrino species @xmath7 .",
    "after the recent , seminal work in @xcite , it has been fully realized that flavor change phenomena driven by ( anti)neutrino self - interactions @xcite may induce dramatic , observable effects in a variety of sn scenarios , especially for inverted mass hierarchy @xcite ; see @xcite for reviews of this rapidly growing research field . in particular ,",
    "the so - called spectral split @xcite or swap @xcite emerges as a distinctive feature in the neutrino @xcite and possibly the antineutrino @xcite energy spectra .",
    "if this feature dominates , then a stepwise flavor conversion of @xmath8 develops across a certain critical energy @xmath9 @xcite , namely , @xmath10 in terms of the survival probability @xmath11 at the end of collective effects .",
    "a somewhat similar feature has been observed in the @xmath12 sector @xcite , although with at different ( generally smaller ) split energy @xmath13 , @xmath14 in a strictly @xmath15 framework with flavors `` @xmath16 '' and `` @xmath17 '' , the net result of collective effects would be a complete interchange , or `` swap , '' of the fluxes @xmath18 between ( @xmath19 ) above @xmath9 @xcite , as well as between @xmath20 above @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "analogously , in a three - flavor scenario with both @xmath22 and @xmath23 acting as a flavor `` @xmath17 , '' @xmath24 and with usual initial conditions @xmath25 a swap is expected to occur between the @xmath16 flavor and one of the two @xmath17 flavors , namely , @xmath26+f_x^0 \\simeq   \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}2 f^0_{x } & ( e < e_c)\\ , \\\\ f^0_e + f^0_x & ( e > e_c)\\ , \\end{array } \\right.\\\\ 2\\overline   f'_{x }   & = & [ \\overline f_e^0(1-\\overline p_{ee})+\\overline f_x^0\\overline p_{ee}]+\\overline f_x^0   \\simeq   \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll } 2 \\overline f^0_{x } & ( e<\\overline e_c)\\ , \\\\",

    "it is important to test the above @xmath27 expectations within comprehensive three - flavor calculations , for various reasons .",
    "first , one has to show that the assumed dominance of spectral split phenomena can indeed be manifest ( without being disrupted by ordinary matter effects ) in a sufficiently general , uncontrived and interesting supernova @xmath27 scenario .",
    "second , the effective factorization of one family out of three _ self - interacting families _ ( leading to nonlinear equations ) is never totally obvious , and `` effective @xmath15 '' expectations like those in eqs .",
    "( [ je])([jxbar ] ) need to be explicitly checked .",
    "third , in the self - interaction context , the probabilities @xmath28 depend , among other things , on the initial conditions and on the absolute fluxes  which do change if the sn energy luminosity ( which also varies in time ) is distributed over @xmath27 rather than @xmath15 .",
    "finally , while the @xmath1 spectral split phenomenon is robust and largely understood in terms of lepton number conservation and adiabatic flavor evolution @xcite , the @xmath29 split seems to be more fragile and related to ( not completely understood ) nonadiabatic aspects of the evolution @xcite ; it is thus worth checking its appearance in a full @xmath27 calculation .",
    "several recent works have focussed on collective effects in @xmath27 scenarios @xcite and have successfully recovered spectral split features in the neutrino sector ( and perhaps also in the antineutrino sector @xcite ) in inverted hierarchy .",
    "we think it useful to add an independent contribution to this very recent research field , by discussing a sn @xmath27 scenario where both the @xmath1 and @xmath2 split features are shown to emerge clearly for a relatively long time of @xmath30 seconds after sn explosion .",
    "such a scenario is thus particularly suited to prospective experimental tests in high - statistics , time - integrated energy spectra of events from the next galactic core - collapse sn .",
    "our work is structured as follows . in sec .  2 we describe a representative sn neutrino framework , where collective effects ( in the form of spectral splits ) are expected to dominate over ordinary matter effects .",
    "in sec .  3",
    "we discuss the @xmath27 formalism used to compute the flavor evolution of the initial fluxes @xmath31 . in sec .",
    "4 we present our results for the fluxes @xmath32 at the end of collective effects , and show that they confirm the simple expectations in eqs .",
    "( [ je])([jxbar ] ) ; we also discuss minor or unobservable features of our calculations . in sec .",
    "5 we complete the flavor evolution of the observable fluxes @xmath18 , by accounting for final phase - averaging and matter effects . in sec .",
    "6 we discuss the effects of some variations in the input sn neutrino spectra , with respect to our default scenario .",
    "section  7 summarizes our results .",
    "the reader is reminded that our results , as well as many other observable features discussed in the growing literature of self - interaction neutrino effects in supernovae , must be taken with a grain of salt . indeed , many open questions are still open from the viewpoint of the theory ( validity of the mean - field approximation in the neutrino evolution equations ) , of the sn explosion energetics ( neutrino luminosities and energy spectra ) and geometry ( asymmetries , turbulence ) , and of the neutrino evolution numerics ( convergence and robustness of calculations ) .",
    "results which currently appear to be rather generic ( such as the spectral split phenomena in inverse hierarchy ) might be unpredictably challenged by improvements and further understanding in any of the above issues .",
    "hopefully , the next galactic supernova explosion(s ) will help to reduce the current level of uncertainty in the physics and astrophysics hidden in the expected neutrino signal .",
    "the adopted @xmath27 oscillation parameters and our reference sn model are discussed below .",
    "we assume that the hierarchy of neutrino masses @xmath33 is inverted ( @xmath34 ) , @xmath35 with squared mass splittings set at the representative values @xmath36 the associated `` high '' ( @xmath37 ) and `` low '' ( @xmath38 ) vacuum oscillation frequencies are then @xmath39 \\ , \\\\ \\omega_l & = & \\frac{\\delta m^2}{2e}\\label{omegal } = \\frac{0.20}{e/\\mathrm{mev}}\\ ; [ \\mathrm{km}^{-1 } ] \\",

    "finally , we ignore possible cp - violating effects ( which are arguably very small @xcite ) by setting @xmath47      our reference sn scenario is essentially taken from @xcite , with minor changes in the average neutrino energies . we assume a galactic core - collapse supernova releasing a binding energy @xmath48  erg , equally distributed among the six ( @xmath49 ) species , and distributed in time with a time constant @xmath50  s. the energy luminosity associated to each species is thus @xmath51 at the conventional distance for a galactic supernova , @xmath52 the unoscillated flux of the neutrino species @xmath7 , per unit of area , time , and energy , is expected to be @xmath53 where we assume normalized thermal energy spectra @xmath54 with average energy @xmath55 . as in @xcite , inspired by @xcite , we set @xmath56 corresponding to temperatures @xmath57 mev . ) will be discussed in sec .",

    "concerning the sn geometry , we adopt the spherically - symmetric bulb model @xcite , with a neutrinosphere radius @xmath60  km . within this model ,",
    "the previous initial conditions for the neutrino luminosity and unoscillated fluxes define , at any radius @xmath61 , the effective density of neutrinos ( @xmath62 ) and of antineutrinos ( @xmath63 ) per unit volume , as well as the self - interaction potential @xmath64\\ . \\label{mu}\\ ] ] for each species @xmath7 , it is useful to introduce also density @xmath65 per unit of volume and energy ( see @xcite for details ) : @xmath66    figure  2 ( left panel ) shows the function @xmath67 , up to @xmath68  km , for the four @xmath4 values chosen . in the same panel , the shaded horizontal band corresponds to the range @xmath69\\simeq [ 6.7,\\,67]$ ]  km@xmath70 where , according to the estimate in @xcite , collective bipolar @xcite ( `` pendulum '' @xcite ) oscillations are expected to develop ( after a `` synchronized '' regime @xcite ) for this sn scenario in the @xmath15 case .",

    ", we have always checked that our results do not appreciably change by continuing the numerical flavor evolution for further @xmath81 km or more ( e.g. , up to @xmath82  km for @xmath0  s ) .",
    "figure  2 ( right panel ) shows the radial profile of the matter potential @xmath83 at different times , as taken from @xcite . as usual , the matter potential is defined as @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the net electron density . in inverted hierarchy , antineutrinos may undergo significant matter effects ( or msw effects , from mikheev , smirnov , and wolfenstein @xcite ) when the so - called @xmath37-resonance condition is fulfilled ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , @xmath86 for the energy range in fig .  1 ( @xmath87 $ ]  mev ) , the relevant interval for the high vacuum frequency , @xmath88 $ ]  km@xmath70 , is shown in the right panel of fig .  2 as a shaded horizontal band .",

    "a comparison of the left and right panels in fig .",
    "2 shows that , in our reference sn model , collective bipolar oscillations develop before possible @xmath37-resonance effects at any time ( while they may be coupled in other scenarios with shallower matter profiles , see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "( [ theta13 ] ) , the @xmath37 resonance is highly nonadiabatic , and produces no further flavor conversion at any relevant sn energy @xcite .",
    "we have numerically verified the absence of msw flavor conversion for antineutrinos in inverted hierarchy ( besides their collective flavor swap ) for @xmath93 well within the @xmath37-resonance region .",
    "we have also verified that all our main results in secs .  4 and  5 remain unchanged for reasonably smaller values of @xmath94 ( e.g. , @xmath95 or @xmath96 ) , which simply cause a logarithmic delay of the bipolar oscillation onset @xcite .",
    "as an added bonus , for @xmath97 , one gets a basically complete suppression of : ( @xmath98 ) possible matter effects due to shock - wave features ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ; ( @xmath99 ) possible decoherence effects due to density fluctuations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ; ( @xmath100 ) earth matter effects , if any , before detection ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these welcome simplifications make neutrino - neutrino interaction effects dominate over neutrino - matter interaction effects at any time @xmath101  s in our framework , and motivate _ a posteriori _ our choice for the tiny mixing angle in eq .",

    "a final remark is in order .",
    "as described in the next sections , we evolve the neutrino flavors along a single , averaged radial trajectory .",
    "this ( so - called `` single - angle '' ) approximation is often reasonable  when compared with few available `` multi - angle '' calculations  but it may fail badly when the matter potential is so high that its gradient depends sensitively on the trajectory ( see @xcite , and references therein ) . for our inspiring sn model @xcite , this situation may occur only at very early stages ( @xmath102  s ) , which are excluded from the present investigation .",

    "however , we do study some interesting variations of the average energies @xmath55 .    in particular , following ref .",
    "@xcite ( inspired by @xcite ) one may adopt the values : @xmath212 which are much closer to each other than our reference choice in eq .",
    "( [ refenergies ] ) .",
    "we shall refer to the choice in eq .",
    "( [ refenergies2 ] ) as to the `` smaller @xmath213 scenario . ''",
    "one may also include average energies with noticeable changes with time , as suggested , e.g. , by the results in @xcite , which read : @xmath214 we shall refer to such assignments as to the `` time - dependent @xmath215 scenario . ''    for fixed energy luminosity [ taken as in eq .",
    "( [ lum ] ) ] , variations in the average neutrino energies lead to variations in their total number and thus also in the self - interaction potential @xmath76 , as compared to the reference one shown in fig .  2 .",
    "figure  7 shows the radial profile of @xmath76 for the case of smaller @xmath213 ( left panel ) and of time - dependent @xmath215 ( right panel ) .",
    "the shaded bands corresponds to the range @xmath69 $ ] where , according to the discussion in @xcite , collective bipolar oscillations occur ; the range is time - dependent in the right panel .",
    "both the @xmath67 curves and the bands in fig .",
    "7 differ from the corresponding ones in fig .  2 .",
    "in particular , at @xmath166  s , the intersection of the @xmath67 curve with the shaded band in fig .  7",
    "leads to the smallest radial interval ( @xmath216  km ) for the development of bipolar oscillations  a fact that leads to an interesting consequence , as shown below .",
    "figure  8 shows the results of the neutrino flavor evolution ( at the end of collective effects ) in the case of smaller @xmath213 . compared with our reference scenario in fig .",
    "3 , the spectral split features are qualitatively similar but less pronounced , as expected from the fact the spectral differences of different species are smaller . in particular , the step - like variation across the split is reduced by a factor of two or more , for both neutrinos ( around @xmath217  mev ) and antineutrinos . from the experimental viewpoint ,",
    "the smaller the split variations , the higher the energy resolution and the statistics needed to observe them .",
    "future sn explosion simulations will shed new light on the expected ( dis)similarities among the unoscillated spectra of @xmath8 , @xmath12 and @xmath218 , and thus on the size of observable oscillation effects ( collective or not ) .",
    "figure  9 is analogous to fig .  8 , but refers to the case of time - dependent @xmath215 ( to be compared with the reference scenario in fig .  3 ) .",
    "in this case , the critical split energies appear to be also time - dependent",
    ". for neutrinos , conservation of net lepton number ( assuming no @xmath2 split in first approximation ) predicts @xmath219 , 8.9 , 9.7 and 9.7  mev for the chosen spectra at @xmath0 , 5 , 10 and 20  s. this trend is consistent with the numerical results in the upper panels of fig .",
    "antineutrinos ( lower panels ) also show a steadily increasing split energy , which we are unable to estimate a priori , however .",
    "the increase in critical energies with time may favorable from the experimental viewpoint , since the cross section increase compensate in part the luminosity decrease ; on the other hand , it may prevent integration of spectra on time intervals larger than @xmath220  s , where the split feature would be blurred .",
    "interestingly , no split appear in fig .  9 at @xmath166",
    "s : the spectra are basically unoscillated .",
    "this fact is related to the very short range @xmath221  km ) expected for the development of bipolar oscillations at @xmath222 , as noted above .",
    "it turns out that the period of bipolar oscillations is of the same order of @xmath223 in this case and , literally , the `` flavor pendulum '' has not enough time to make a single swing : it remains frozen in the upward , unstable equilibrium position , due to the extremely sudden decrease of @xmath67 .",
    "conversely , in our reference scenario at @xmath166  s ( see fig .",
    "3 ) the range @xmath223 happens to be slightly larger , thus enabling the flavor pendulum to make a full swing and to start the collective transitions , which eventually lead to the spectral split . at late time , the neutrino and antineutrino splits appears thus to be relatively fragile phenomena , whose absence or presence might provide , in principle , some information about the gradient of the self - interaction neutrino potential @xmath67 .",
    "building upon recent literature on @xmath27 collective effects in core - collapse supernovae @xcite , we have performed an independent study of three - flavor evolution of neutrinos and antineutrinos within a rather `` standard '' sn model ( figs .  1 and 2 ) .",
    "then , assuming inverted neutrino mass hierarchy and tiny @xmath45 ( i.e. , strongly nonadiabatic @xmath37-resonance ) , self - interaction effects are expected to provide the dominant spectral features , in the form of `` splits''or `` stepwise swaps''for both @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we have explored this sn @xmath27 scenario by solving the evolution equations for the @xmath27 density matrix in vector form and single - angle approximation , after discretization in energy .",
    "the numerical results for the evolved fluxes at the end of collective effects ( fig .",
    "3 ) confirm basic expectations at low and high energy [ eqs .",
    "( [ je])([jxbar ] ) ] in terms of unevolved fluxes ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "effects of the `` solar '' mass splitting and of the @xmath22-@xmath23 interaction energy difference in matter are found to be negligible ; effects due to variations of @xmath43 are large ( fig .  5 ) but unobservable .",
    "the final fluxes at the detector ( fig .",
    "6 ) are obtained by standard application of adiabatic @xmath38-resonance effects .",
    "both @xmath1 and @xmath2 spectral split features tipically emerge with similar characteristics in the whole time interval considered ( @xmath020  s ) .",
    "observations of such features ( if realized in nature ) and of their possible variations require low - energy thresholds , where the signal is suppressed by low cross sections ; however , time integration can partly overcome the suppression , without necessarily canceling the persistent spectral features . if the collected statistics and the energy resolution allow , spectra collected at different times might even reveal migrations of the split energies due to time variations of neutrino temperatures",
    ". the low - energy frontier in sn neutrino physics may thus be the key to access the physics of inverted mass hierarchy , especially if @xmath45 is very small .",
