    "the one - atom - thick graphene sheet possesses unique electronic properties based on the zero energy gap in its electron band structure . however , a finite band gap is of crucial importance for applications in field - effect transistor devices .",
    "therefore , a meaningful work is to realize band gap opening in the electron band structure of graphene . both experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite",
    "groups have recently demonstrated a novel approach to accomplish tunable band gap through growing hexagonal boron nitride islands within graphene sheet .",
    "this improvement benefits the practical development of graphene - based electronic nano - devices . for high qulity electronic devices ,",
    "the joule heating induced breakdown is a significant bottleneck to the advancement of the devices,@xcite so it is of essential importance to enhance the capability of heat delivery in these devices .",
    "the situation becomes completely opposite in the thermoelectric field , where low thermal conductivity is in great demand for high value of zt.@xcite hence , it is an urgent and practical task to supply some information for experimentalists on the modification of the heat transport capability for their graphene and hexagonal boron nitride ( cbn ) compound for different application motivations .",
    "that is the aim of present work .    in this work ,",
    "we use both molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation and nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) approaches to investigate the heat transport across the cbn interface .",
    "the interface is built inner a graphene nanoribbon of armchair edge .",
    "we study the heat current reduced by cbn interface of different shapes and sizes , including zigzag trigonal interface [ cbn(tz ) ] , armchair trigonal interface [ cbn(ta ) ] , square interface [ cbn(s ) ] , and circular interface [ cbn(c ) ] .",
    "the size of the interface is characterized by the number of carbon atoms at the interface , @xmath3 , which varies from 0 to 60 in this work .",
    "two same phenomena are observed from the two different investigation methods .",
    "firstly , the heat current is reduced linearly with the increase of @xmath3 in all samples , and the reduction is more than 50% for @xmath4 .",
    "secondly , with same @xmath3 , the zigzag interface causes stronger reduction of heat current than the armchair interface .",
    "these effects are interpreted from the lattice dynamics analysis and the negf transmission function which are nicely consistent with each other .",
    "the lattice dynamics analysis finds that the heat reduction is induced by the localized phonon modes at the cbn interface .",
    "the density of states ( dos ) for the localized modes increases with increasing @xmath3 and it is larger in zigzag interface than the armchair interface , which explain the two observed phenomena .",
    "particularly , strong localized modes are found in the frequency regions around 300 , 800 , and 1400 @xmath5 . in the other explanation ,",
    "the negf transmission function is depressed more seriously with increasing @xmath3 , and stronger depression is found in the zigzag interface than the armchair interface .",
    "it also shows that the transmission function of phonon modes around 300 , 800 , and 1400 @xmath5 undergo strong depression for all cbn interfaces , which coincides with the former lattice dynamics analysis .",
    "there are three different elements , c , b , and n , in present work .",
    "we have recently developed a set of tersoff+uoop potential to simultaneously describe both the in - plane and out - of - plane vibrations in hexagonal boron nitride sheet.@xcite this potential is of high efficiency , stability , and is particularly suitable for the investigation of heat transport as it properly describes the phonon spectrum .",
    "the interaction between b and n in the cbn samples is governed by this set of tersoff+uoop potential . for the interaction between carbon atoms in graphene ,",
    "we can develop a parallel set of tersoff+uoop potential as the graphene and bn sheet have quite similar honeycomb structure .",
    "the original tersoff parameters for carbon system were developed for sp3 structures,@xcite so they can not be directly applied to sp2-bonding graphene .",
    "explicitly , the frequencies of in - plane vibrations from this potential are about 60% higher than experimental values . to eliminate this flaw , we scale the @xmath6 and @xmath7 parameters in tersoff potential by a factor of 0.4 , which leads to reasonable frequencies for in - plane vibrations as shown in fig .",

    "however , the result also shows that the frequencies of out - of - plane vibrations ( za and zo ) are obviously smaller than the experimental value .",
    "this disagreement roots in the form of the tersoff potential , where the in - plane and out - of - plane vibrations are coupled together . to modify the out - of - plane vibrations without affecting the in - plane vibrations",
    ", we introduce the universal out - of - plane ( uoop ) potential@xcite to describe the out - of - plane vibrations .",

    "[ fig_graphene_phonon ] by solid red line , so it is suitable for the study of heat transport in graphene .",
    "note , however , that the calculated frequencies of the high energy in - plane optical modes ( lo and to ) do not agree with experiment in detail , because these two optical modes are more sensitive to long - range interaction which is ignored in the bond order tersoff potential .",
    "the interactions between different elements are also described by the tersoff potential with the parameters determined by the combining law of multicomponent systems.@xcite    [ 1.0 ] for different cbn interfaces : ( a ) and ( b ) from md simulation ; ( c ) and ( d ) from negf calculation.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    the single parameter @xmath12 introduced by the combining law is set to be 1.0 , which may lead to possible error .",
    "however , the error is quite small , because @xmath12 acts as a fine tuning parameter .",
    "furthermore , the success of the combining law mainly relies on the tersoff potentials between individual element , which have been carefully fitted to experimental data in the above .",

    "periodic boundary condition is applied in the lateral direction of the nanoribbon , so that we can avoid the edge effect and focus on the effect of the cbn interface .",
