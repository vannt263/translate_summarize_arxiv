    "attempts to characterize the distribution of mass , orbital radius , and eccentricity of extrasolar planets are hampered by the lack of knowledge of detection sensitivities .",
    "following our previous study of the lick survey ( cumming , marcy , & butler 1999 , hereafter cmb ) , the aim of this work is to carefully assess the detection threshold and selection biases for a sample of stars from the keck survey , and use this information to constrain the distribution of orbital parameters .",
    "we analyse radial velocity measurements for 580 f , g , k , m stars from the keck survey .",
    "typically , each star has 3 or 4 measurements per year over 2 to 5 years with measurement errors between 2 and 5 m / s .    we adopt a least - squares approach .",
    "first , we check whether the velocity scatter is consistent with measurement errors and intrinsic stellar `` jitter '' .",
    "the jitter , which arises from a combination of convective motions , magnetic activity , and rotation , is estimated from stellar parameters such as rotation period and mass .",
    "assuming gaussian statistics , we calculate the probability of obtaining @xmath0 as large or larger than the observed value from measurement errors and jitter alone , adopting a threshold probability of @xmath1 .",
    "the solid line in figure 1 shows the signal to noise needed for a signal to be detected by this method 50% of the time as a function of the number of data points @xmath2 .",
    "we define the signal to noise as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the velocity amplitude , and @xmath5 the expected noise amplitude . even with only a few measurements , signals @xmath6 are detected .",
    "next , we look for periodicities using the lomb - scargle periodogram ( scargle 1982 ; walker et al .  1995 ;",
    "cmb ) , which is similar to the f - statistic , measuring the improvement in @xmath0 between a model which includes a sinusoid and one that does not .",
    "we look for the maximum periodogram power between 2 days and 10 years , and use monte carlo methods to assess its significance .",
    "the dashed lines ( analytic    = 3.75 in    result ) and squares ( numerical result ) in figure 1 show the signal to noise ratio needed to identify a periodic signal 50% ( filled squares ) and 90% ( open squares ) of the time ( significance level @xmath1 ) as a function of number of data points . to obtain analytic estimates ,",
    "we follow the approach of horne & baliunas ( 1986 ) , but using the correct statistical distribution for periodogram powers in the presence of noise ( cmb appendix b ) .",
    "we find the signal to noise ratio needed for detection 50% of the time is @xmath7^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath8 the number of independent frequencies searched , and @xmath9 the false alarm probability needed for detection . for large @xmath2",
    "the 50% threshold is @xmath10^{1/2}$ ] , or @xmath11 for typical values @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "figure 1 is striking because when looking for periodic signals , we are used to being able to `` dig into the noise '' .",
    "however , here we are limited by the small number of observations .",
    "points to note are : ( i ) even with small @xmath2 , we detect excess variability if @xmath14@xmath15 , ( ii ) it is hard to characterize an orbit when the number of observations is @xmath16 , ( iii ) we detect periodic signals with @xmath17@xmath18 when @xmath19@xmath20 , and ( iv ) detecting amplitudes @xmath21 requires @xmath22 .",
    "we are currently extending this approach to include eccentric orbits .",
    "however for now , we use the best - fit circular orbit amplitude and period from the periodogram as initial conditions for a full keplerian fit . the resulting keplerian amplitudes and periods for the significant detections",
    "are shown in figure 2 .",
    "most , but not all , of the candidates from the periodogram analysis are announced planets ( open circles ) . those candidates that have not been announced ( filled squares ) have either low amplitude or long orbital period . there is an `` effective detection threshold '' beyond that set by the statistics of the periodogram .",
    "this comes from ( i ) we must be sure the observed variations are not due to periodic stellar jitter , and ( ii ) inability to characterize orbits longer than the duration of the observations .",
    "the announced planets have velocity amplitude @xmath23@xmath24 , periods less than the duration of the observations ( @xmath25@xmath26 ) , and number of data points @xmath27 .",
    "better characterization of jitter would aid detection of low amplitude planets .",
    "finally , for most stars with no detection , we can exclude companions with velocity amplitudes @xmath23@xmath28 , or @xmath29@xmath30 , for orbital periods less than the duration of the observations ( 2 to 5 years ) .",
    "we adopt a bayesian approach to constrain the distribution of masses , orbital periods , and eccentricities _ using both detections and upper limits_. these calculations are currently in progress , here we discuss the methodology .",
    "consider a model of the distribution of masses and orbital periods @xmath31 ( normalized so that @xmath32 ) and fraction of stars with planets @xmath33 .",
    "we write a likelihood function @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes each star , and @xmath36 this expression includes the probability of the data _ given a planet _ of mass @xmath8 , period @xmath37 , @xmath38 ^ 2\\over 2\\sigma_k^2}\\right),\\ ] ] and the probability of the data _ given no planet _ @xmath39 .",
    "no decision must be made for each star about whether a planet has been detected or not : both possibilities are included , weighted by their relative probability .",
    "this approach can be readily generalized to include , for example , eccentric orbits .    as a check ,",
    "imagine we can definitely say whether a star has a planet or not . the likelihood is",
    "then @xmath40 where @xmath41 planets are detected out of @xmath42 stars .",
    "maximizing @xmath43 with respect to @xmath33 gives the expected result @xmath44 , the best guess at the fraction of stars with planets is the observed fraction .",
    "two striking features already apparent are ( i ) the lack of massive planets at short periods ( easiest to detect , but not seen ) , and ( ii ) the `` pile - up '' of planets at orbital periods @xmath45 ( no planets were found between @xmath46 and @xmath47 days in our search , suggesting that this is not a selection effect ) .",
    "we are currently investigating these issues and others more carefully , including ( i ) the fraction of stars with planets , ( ii ) whether there is a lack of saturn - mass companions at short orbital periods , and ( iii ) whether planet properties depend on the spectral type of the host star .",
