    "non - equilibrium growth is ubiquitous in nature and is encountered in fields as diverse as materials science or biological physics @xcite .",
    "kinetic roughening of interfaces displays a high degree of universality which has been the focus of many theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "systems with non - equilibrium growth typically have three different dynamic regimes . starting from a flat substrate",
    ", the surface initially grows in an uncorrelated way , yielding what is sometimes called the random deposition ( rd ) regime .",
    "as time goes on , correlations build up , leading to the correlated regime .",
    "even though the nature of this regime depends on the rules of the growth process , one generically finds that the time dependent mean interface width @xmath0 increases as a power of time , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the so - called growth exponent .",
    "this correlated growth continues until the saturation regime is reached for which @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the linear size of the system and @xmath5 is the roughness exponent .",
    "the different growth universality classes are characterised by different values of the exponents @xmath5 and @xmath2 . in the past",
    "most studies focused on the scaling behaviour of the surface width , as exemplified by the celebrated family - vicsek scaling relation @xcite .",
    "it is only rather recently ( however , see @xcite for an early exception ) that the study of correlation and response functions has been shown to yield interesting insights into non - equilibrium growth processes and the related interface fluctuations @xcite .",
    "two - time quantities are nowadays routinely studied in the context of non - equilibrium relaxation and ageing phenomena @xcite where in most cases the focus is on local quantities .",
    "for example when studying a magnetic system one usually investigates the spin - spin correlation function or the response of a spin to a local magnetic field .",
    "incidentally , the study of ageing in magnetic systems has revealed that additional insights can be gained by looking at global quantities , as for example the magnetisation - magnetisation correlation or the response of the magnetisation to a spatially constant magnetic field @xcite .    in the studies of growth",
    "processes mainly local two - time quantities have been investigated in the past @xcite .",
    "examples include the two - time height - height correlation function @xcite or the response of the height to a local perturbation @xcite .",
    "some attention has also been paid to slightly more complex quantities as for example the two - time roughness or the two - time incoherent scattering function @xcite .",
    "both the local height - height autocorrelation function @xmath6 and the local autoresponse function @xmath7 display simple ageing scaling forms @xcite , irrespective of whether the system is linear or non - linear : @xmath8 where the scaling functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 are power - laws in the long time limit , i.e. @xmath11 and @xmath12 for @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the values of the dynamical exponent @xmath14 as well as of the scaling exponents @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 depend on the dynamical universality class . for growth processes",
    "the dynamical exponent @xmath14 is related to the roughness exponent @xmath5 and the growth exponent @xmath2 by the relation @xmath19 . as shown in the studies @xcite the local autocorrelation and autoresponse exponents , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , are identical .",
    "in addition , they are given by @xmath20 in systems described by a linear stochastic equation .",
    "here @xmath21 is the dimensionality of the substrate .",
    "in addition , the scaling exponent of the correlation function , @xmath15 , is given by @xmath22 , whereas for the scaling exponent of the response function the relation @xmath23 can be conjectured .",
    "as for the linear stochastic equations we have that @xmath24 , it follows that in linear systems both scaling exponents have the same value , @xmath25 .",
    "this is different for the non - linear kardar - parisi - zhang equation @xcite where for a one - dimensional substrate we have @xmath26 and @xmath27 , yielding @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the ageing behaviour of certain global two - time quantities , namely the correlation function of the squared width and the response of the squared width to a global perturbation .",
    "we show that the scaling behaviour of the global response depends in linear systems on how the system is perturbed , yielding different results for different protocols .",
    "this observation is of interest as the global response should be readily accessible in smoothening experiments @xcite , for example . exploiting the fact that exact solutions can be obtained for growth processes described by linear langevin equations , we comprehensively study the scaling behaviour of these global two - time quantities for the edwards - wilkinson @xcite and the noisy mullins - herring equations @xcite , thereby distinguishing between various limiting cases . in order to gain some understanding of the behaviour of these quantities in non - linear systems",
    ", we also discuss some data that have been obtained by numerically integrating the non - linear kardar - parisi - zhang equation @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that in the non - trivial correlated regime the two - time global quantities generically exhibit a behaviour of full ageing .",
    "we also discuss the global fluctuation - dissipation ratio and show how this quantity can be used for the characterisation of growth processes .",
    "our paper is organised in the following way . in the next section",
    "we remind the reader of the typical behaviour of a growing surface .",
    "this is done with the help of a microscopic deposition model @xcite that is very well described by the one - dimensional edwards - wilkinson equation .",
    "this model also allows us to motivate the different global perturbations that we are going to discuss in the following sections .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the exact computation of the global two - time quantities in cases that are described by linear stochastic langevin equations .",
    "the exact results allow us to comprehensively investigate all possible dynamical regimes . in section 4 we present our results for the one - dimensional kardar - parisi - zhang equation where we highlight some commonalities with and differences to the linear systems discussed in the previous section .",
    "finally , section 5 gives out conclusions .",
    "in the following we briefly discuss the behaviour of a simple deposition model that turns out to be an excellent representative of the edwards - wilkinson universality class .",
    "this model is then used to motivate the different protocols discussed in the next sections for measuring the global response .",
    "in contrast to the original model there is a non - vanishing probability that a deposited particle jumps to a neighbouring site with a higher height than the deposition site .",
    "we assume this jump to be thermally activated and to depend on @xmath38 ( the temperature of the substrate ) . as we discuss in the following ,",
    "the ratio @xmath39 is a parameter that governs the morphology of the growing interface and allows us to study the response of the surface to a change in external conditions .",
    "it is instructive to look at the behaviour of the model in the limits of @xmath40 and @xmath41 . at zero temperature no jumps to sites with higher height",
    "are allowed , and the particle is incorporated into the aggregate at the selected neighbouring site if the column at that site is shorter than at the initial site .",
    "thus , for @xmath40 we recover the rdsr process @xcite . in the opposite limit , @xmath41",
    ", however , a particle will always jump to the selected neighbouring column , irrespective of the height difference . as a result",
    ", the different columns will grow independently , yielding an uncorrelated surface as for the rd process . for intermediate temperatures , a crossover between the rd and the rdsr processes",
    "is observed , with the crossover point depending on the temperature .",
    "the temperature dependence of the model is illustrated in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "suppose a particle is deposited on top of the middle column in the configuration shown , the plot provides the @xmath39 dependence of the probabilities for having this particle end up at one of the three sites .",
    "in the original family model the particle would always come to rest on top of the left column .",
    "= 4.25 in     of course , temperature has been introduced in theoretical studies of growth processes prior to our work ( see @xcite for some examples ) . for a typical microscopic model studied in this context one",
    "often assumes that the atom s hopping follows an arrhenius - like rate that is proportional to @xmath42 , where the activation energy @xmath43 is itself proportional to the number of bonds formed by the atom before the hopping attempt .",
    "whereas this is surely a rather realistic modelling of diffusion processes on a crystal surface , we have opted here for a simpler approach where the probability for a particle to hop depends on the height difference between the actual site and the proposed new site .",
    "( note that jumps to sites with higher heights have also been allowed in other microscopic growth models @xcite ) .",
    "as we will show in the following , all aspects of our simple model agree perfectly with the solution of the stochastic edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) equation with a _",
    "fit parameter .      in the following we are interested in the dependence of the surface width @xmath44 on time @xmath33 , on the ratio @xmath39 , and on system size @xmath4 ( in this section we only discuss the one - dimensional case ) . in our simulations",
    ", we have a wide range of @xmath39 values and several @xmath4 s up to 1000 . for simplicity",
    ", we always start from a flat surface , i.e.  @xmath45 for @xmath46 . for the data discussed below",
    ", the unit of @xmath33 is one monte carlo step ( i.e. , @xmath4 particles deposited ) and we averaged over 1000 independent runs with different random numbers .    in figure [ fig2]a , c we show the time dependence of the surface width for , respectively , the case with fixed @xmath47 at different @xmath39 s and the case with a fixed @xmath48 and various @xmath4 s . as for the rdsr process one distinguishes three regimes separated by two crossover points : a random deposition ( rd ) regime , followed by a ew regime , with a final crossover to the saturation regime .",
    "in contrast to family s original model , the initial rd process is not confined to very early times @xmath49 but extends to larger times .",
    "in fact , the crossover time @xmath50 between the rd and the ew regimes is shifted to higher values for increasing temperatures and diverges in the limit of infinite temperatures . as the crossover is smeared out , we identify the crossover point with the intersection point of the straight lines fitted to the two linear regimes in the log - log plots .",
    "due to the nature of the uncorrelated deposition of particles ( poisson process ) , we have the identity @xmath51 in the rd regime , yielding the width @xmath52 at the crossover point . in the ew regime",
    "the relation between width and deposition time changes to @xmath53 .",
    "this regime extends up to a second crossover point @xmath54 , whose precise location also depends on the value of @xmath38 and beyond which the final saturation regime prevails .",
    "the crossover between the different regimes is further illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , d where we show the time evolution of the effective exponent @xmath55 for the two cases .",
    "= 5.25 in     next , we turn our attention to the stochastic ew equation ( see also the next section ) @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a gaussian white noise with zero mean and covariance @xmath58 ( @xmath21 is the dimensionality of the substrate ) and @xmath59 is the surface tension or diffusion constant .",

    "@xmath63 . the effective exponent is therefore given by    @xmath64 /q_n^2}~.",
    "\\label{eqbeta}\\ ] ]    in the expression ( [ eqwsq ] ) , we must fix @xmath65 in order to agree with @xmath51 in the rd regime .",
    "this leaves us with just one free parameter , namely , @xmath66 , which can be obtained by fitting the numerical data to the theoretical expression , see table [ table1 ] .",
    "the result of this procedure can be summarized by @xmath67 with @xmath68 and @xmath69 . as the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] show , excellent fits are achieved with these values of @xmath59 . clearly , the theoretical curves are in very good agreement with the data over the entire range of @xmath4 s and @xmath39 s explored .",
    "note in addition that it is possible to collapse _ all _ data onto a single curve @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a @xmath70 dependence of the surface tension @xmath59 is typically encountered in experiments on step fluctuations @xcite or on surface smoothening @xcite which are described theoretically by linear langevin equations .",
    ".values for the surface tension @xmath59 at different values of @xmath39 that result from a fit of the numerical data to the exact solution of the edwards - wilkinson equation . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the fluctuation - dissipation ratio @xcite has been introduced as a generalisation of the celebrated fluctuation - dissipation theorem to non - equilibrium systems . whereas this ratio has some appealing features , as for example its simplicity and the possibility to assign an effective temperature to a non - equilibrium system @xcite ,",
    "many studies in model systems have revealed major problems with that quantity , ranging from observable dependent effective temperatures @xcite to the appearance of negative temperatures @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the usefulness of the fluctuation - dissipation ratio is in general very restricted , even so it might occasionally yield interesting insights in specific systems",
    ".    the fluctuation - dissipation ratios of local quantities and the related effective temperatures have also been studied for the one - dimensional ew equation @xcite ( higher dimensional cases and the mh cases can be inferred from the equations given in @xcite ) .",
    "this study shows that the ratio of the response @xmath7 of the height to the height - height correlation @xmath6 allows in the linear systems to characterise the different growth regimes through an effective temperature .    for a time - integrated linear response @xmath71 and the conjugate correlation function",
    "it is convenient to discuss the ratio @xmath72 and measure the limit value @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , taking this limit does not yield non - trivial results for our global quantities . assuming this system to be infinite ( such that one remains in the correlated regime in the long - time limit )",
    ", one immediately sees from the tables [ table2 ] and [ table3 ] that the trivial value @xmath74 is obtained for the global fluctuation - dissipation ratio , and it is not possible to introduce a meaningful effective temperature .",
    "still , the quantity @xmath75 does yield at finite times a behaviour that is characteristic for the different regimes , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for the ratio formed by the global response to a change in @xmath59 and the global correlation . in order to understand this figure ,",
    "let us look at a case ( the case @xmath76 in the figure ) where the waiting time is in the rd regime .",
    "if @xmath77 , i.e. @xmath33 is also in that regime , the ratio ( [ eq : x ] ) is constant : @xmath78 . if @xmath33 is such that @xmath79 , i.e. @xmath33 is in the correlated regime , @xmath80 is inversely proportional to @xmath33 : @xmath81 .",
    "the same behaviour , albeit with a different pre - factor , is obtained if we consider the global response to a change in @xmath82 instead .",
    "finally , in the saturation regime , with @xmath83 , @xmath80 is again constant , with @xmath84 .",
    "these three regimes are separated by crossover regimes when @xmath85 or @xmath86 . if we choose a different waiting time , @xmath87 or @xmath88 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the ratio @xmath75 , after some non - universal behaviour for @xmath89 , rapidly evolves towards the same master curve as the @xmath76 data .",
    "in order to assess the importance of non - linearities , we also studied global quantities derived from the one - dimensional kpz equation .",
    "we thereby complement the studies @xcite which focused on local quantities .",
    "the kpz equation has been shown to describe faithfully kinetic roughening and to be a paradigmatic model for the description of a large range of non - equilibrium systems @xcite .",
    "this well - known equation is given by the expression @xmath90 and differs from the ew equation by the non - linear term proportional to the parameter @xmath91 .",
    "here @xmath57 is the usual gaussian white noise with zero mean and covariance @xmath58 .",
    "the numerical integration of ( [ eqkpz ] ) has been the subject of many studies and different discretisation schemes have been proposed in order to handle the non - linearity ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "we also studied for this system the global correlation and response functions introduced in the previous sections . in order to make sure that our results are independent of the integration schemes , we computed these quantities using different approaches , namely the scheme of lam and shin @xcite as well as the strong coupling scheme proposed by newman and co - workers @xcite .",
    "we carefully checked that we are in the correlated regime at both times @xmath92 and @xmath33 .",
    "we also verified that both approaches yield the same exponents and scaling functions for the studied quantities .",
    "the data obtained from both schemes differ by a non - universal pre - factor , as expected .",
    "small deviations between the data sets are observed for @xmath77 , but this is again expected as for the lam / shin scheme we use finite values of @xmath91 , whereas the newman scheme works in the strong - coupling limit where @xmath93 .",
    "= 5.25 in     fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] summarizes our main findings regarding the scaling behaviour of global quantities in the one - dimensional kpz universality class . for the autocorrelation ( [ eq : corr ] ) we find the scaling form @xmath94 with @xmath95 for @xmath13 .",
    "for the response functions we note , and this is in strong contrast to the results we obtained for the linear equations , that the scaling behaviour does not depend on the protocol that we use for perturbing the system . and",
    "the time @xmath33 as @xmath96 and @xmath97 we can rewrite the kpz equation as @xmath98 where @xmath99 and the noise is still gaussian with the same strength @xmath82 , we only consider the same two types of perturbations as for the linear systems . ] whether we change the surface tension or the noise strength , we always end up with the following scaling behaviour of the global response : @xmath100 with @xmath101 for @xmath13 .",
    "this difference between the global response in the linear and the non - linear cases is remarkable . at this stage",
    ", we can only speculate on the origin of this , but it seems that the restoring mechanism , that is responsible for the relaxation of the perturbed but still growing interface , originates in the non - linearity , thereby yielding the same scaling behaviour independent of the nature of the perturbation .",
    "further studies seem to be in order to fully clarify this point .",
    "we can compare the scaling forms ( [ eq : ckpz ] ) and ( [ eq : cchi ] ) with themselves as well as with the scaling forms of the local quantities .",
    "we remark that we have : @xmath102 and @xmath29 , @xmath103 and @xmath28 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , i.e. the global exponents always differ from their corresponding local exponents .",
    "finally , let us mention that also for the kpz case one does not obtain non - trivial limits for global fluctuation - dissipation ratios .",
    "still , one can perform a similar analysis as done in the previous section for the linear systems , thereby recovering the same three regimes , but with a different dependence on @xmath33 , @xmath106 , in the correlated regime .",
    "our study of global quantities in growth processes has revealed some interesting results , especially in the correlated regime , and raises a range of open questions that warrant a more in - depth study in the future .",
    "a prediction of the scaling behaviour of our global quantities is far from obvious , due to the complicated nature of the mean square width that involves all fourier components ( with the exception of the zero mode ) of the fourier series representation of the surface height .",
    "we find the available results to be compatible with the scaling form @xmath107 with @xmath108 for @xmath13 , as is readily checked by recalling that for the linear equations @xmath109 and @xmath110 , whereas for the one - dimensional kpz equation @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "similarly , for the the global response of the square of the surface width to a change in the noise strength ( we need to specify this for the linear systems ) is compatible with the scaling form @xmath113 with @xmath114 for @xmath13 .",
    "we are not able to derive these scaling forms at this stage .",
    "in fact , the situation for the response function is rather complex .",
    "the reason is of course that for the linear systems the global response depends on how the system was perturbed , as the different protocols lead to different scaling forms .",
    "this is different for the non - linear kpz equation , as here the same scaling forms are found for the different perturbations .",
    "obviously , the non - linearity provides an efficient smoothening mechanism that allows the system to relax to the state of the unperturbed system in a way that is independent on how the system has been perturbed .",
    "this mechanism is absent in the linear systems , yielding the observed dependence of the response on the protocol .",
    "a more quantitative study of this effect is left for the future .",
    "our study also reveals that in the correlated regime the usual limit value of the fluctuation - dissipation ratio involving global quantities only leads to trivial results .",
    "however , the ratio ( [ eq : x ] ) at finite observation times still allows us to distinguish between the different growth regimes .    in order to measure a global response",
    "one needs to perturb in a uniform way the system . on the level of the langevin equations ,",
    "this type of perturbation can only be achieved by varying one of the parameters entering these equations . as we argued in section 2.3 ,",
    "based on the microscopic model , the surface tension @xmath59 is directly related to the quantity conjugated to the square of the surface width .",
    "this is different for the strength @xmath82 of the noise correlator .",
    "it is therefore interesting to note the similarities in the response of the squared width due to a change of either the surface tension or the noise strength . in both cases the non - equilibrium exponents that govern the behaviour in the ageing regime are not identical to the corresponding exponents describing the correlation function of the squared width",
    "this seems therefore to be a general property of global two - time quantities .",
    "experimentally a global response is much easier to measure than a local one .",
    "local perturbations and local measurements are not easily achieved in a growing system .",
    "this is different for a global response that is readily observed when changing the experimental conditions , for example through a change in temperature , as this automatically affects the whole system .",
    "another advantage of studying global quantities in the context of growth processes is seen at the upper critical dimension . indeed",
    ", global quantities continue to display a standard dynamical scaling behaviour at the critical dimension .",
    "local quantities , however , generically display a logarithmic dependence on time in that case which makes an analysis much more demanding . for these reasons",
    "we hope that our study will motivate other groups , especially experimental ones , to use global quantities for the characterisation of non - equilibrium growth processes .",
    "we thank sebastian bustingorry for bringing reference @xcite to our attention and uwe tuber for an enlightening discussion on conjugated quantities within a field - theoretical setting .",

    "<S> in order to characterise non - equilibrium growth processes , we study the behaviour of global quantities that depend in a non - trivial way on two different times . we discuss the dynamical scaling forms of global correlation and response functions and show that the scaling behaviour of the global response can depend on how the system is perturbed . on the one hand we derive exact expressions for systems characterised by linear langevin equations ( as for example the edwards - wilkinson and the noisy mullins - herring equations ) , on the other hand we discuss the influence of non - linearities on the scaling behaviour of global quantities by integrating numerically the kardar - parisi - zhang equation . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss global fluctuation - dissipation ratios and how to use them for the characterisation of non - equilibrium growth processes .    </S>"
