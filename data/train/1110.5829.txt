    "qcd , the theory for the strong interactions , can be confronted with experiments only after providing it with a few inputs : one mass parameter for each quark species and the only surviving parameter in the limit of massless quarks , namely @xmath3 , the energy scale used as the typical boundary condition for the integration of the renormalization group equation for the strong coupling constant .",
    "thus , contrary to its running that can be computed in perturbation theory , the value of the renormalized strong coupling at any scale , or equivalently @xmath3 , has to be taken from experiment .",
    "the qcd running coupling can be also obtained from lattice computations , where the lattice spacing replaces @xmath3 as a free parameter to be adjusted from experimental numbers : masses , decay constants , etc .",
    "different methods have been used for the lattice calculation of @xmath3 . among the most extensively applied , we can enumerate the implemention of the schrdiger functional scheme ( see , for instance ,  @xcite and references therein ) , those based on the perturbative analysis of short - distance sensitive lattice observables as the inter - quark static potential ( see for instance  @xcite ) , heavy - quark potential , wilson loops or small creutz ratios expanded in the `` boosted '' lattice coupling ( see  @xcite and reference therein ) or the vacuum polarization functions  @xcite ; and , in particular , those based on the study of the momentum behaviour of green functions ( see  @xcite and references therein ) . in previous studies we compared the behaviour of the 2-gluon and 3-gluon green functions as a function of the renormalization scale with the perturbative predictions .",
    "this allowed us to get estimations for @xmath4 and @xmath3 ; but it also revealed the presence of non - perturbative power corrections which we interpreted as coming from the dimension - two non - zero landau - gauge gluon condensate in an ope approach  .    in the last few years , several authors of this paper have been pursuing a program to study the running of the strong coupling , and so evaluate @xmath3 , grounded on the lattice determination of the ghost - gluon coupling in the so - called mom taylor renormalization scheme .",
    "the main advantage of this ghost - gluon approach is that the lattice computation of the coupling only involves the calculation of two - point correlators , which yields a very good control of the lattice artefacts over a large momentum window , mainly owing to the @xmath5-extrapolation prescription  @xcite , and then for a precise checking of the running .",
    "we have first analyzed the pure yang - mills case ( @xmath6 )  @xcite and next extended the analysis to the case in which twisted @xmath7 dynamical quarks were included in the lattice simulations  @xcite .",
    "now , for the first time , we apply the same approach ( outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec : proc ] ) to study the strong coupling by dealing with lattice simulations with two light degenerate twisted - mass flavours and a heavy doublet to include the strange and charm dynamical quarks .",
    "this is done within the framework of the european twisted mass ( etm ) collaboration from where we used several ensembles of gauge fields for different bare lattice couplings , twisted masses and volume to conclude that : ( i ) the running description of the data requires to take into account non - perturbative power corrections , which appear to behave as ope  @xcite predict when a non - vanishing landau - gauge dimension - two gluon condensate is considered ; and ( ii ) only after taking into account the non - perturbative power corrections , the lattice estimate for @xmath3 strikingly agrees with the experimental result , as can be seen in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] .",
    "we shall follow the procedure described in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite to extract an estimate of @xmath0 from the non - perturbative lattice determination of @xmath8 , the running strong coupling renormalized in the mom taylor scheme and landau gauge .",
    "let us recall briefly how the procedure works .",
    "the taylor coupling is defined by [ alpha ] _",
    "t(^2 ) =  _ g(^2,^2 ) f^2(^2,^2 )  , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 stand for the bare ghost and gluon dressing functions in landau - gauge . as was thoroughly explained in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also the appendix a of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the well - known taylor s paper  @xcite proved that , at any order in perturbation , the proper ghost - gluon vertex trivially takes its tree - level form when the incoming ghost momentum vanishes , this implying that the renormalisation constant for this proper ghost - gluon vertex is just equal to 1 in the mom - like scheme defined by the particular kinematics with a zero - momentum incoming ghost , _",
    "i.e. _ taylor scheme .",
    "this is not only true in perturbation but it can be also concluded that taking the limit of a vanishing incoming ghost momentum drops any non - perturbative correction away from the whole proper ghost - gluon vertex , as was discussed in ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "thus , for the landau - gauge taylor - scheme running coupling can be straighforwardly derived from this last result .",
    "the ghost and gluon dressing functions will be here obtained from @xmath1=2 + 1 + 1 gauge configurations for several bare couplings , light twisted masses and volumes .",
    "contrarily to the analysis performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the interplay of light and heavy quark mass and uv cut - off effects makes a chiral extrapolation harder .",
    "further studies are underway for a better control of this point .",
    "thus , for the scope of this paper , we will content ourselves with an estimation of the uncertainty due to the quark mass effects .",
    "it should be emphasized that a crucial role is played by the appropriate elimination of discretization artefacts to provide us with reliable and exploitable results .",
    "a first step consists in curing the artefacts which are due to the breaking of the rotational invariance on the lattice , where the remaining symmetry is restricted to the @xmath5 isometry group . for this purpose ,",
    "we perform the so - called @xmath5-extrapolation procedure  @xcite that leaves us with [ eq : h4 ] _ t^latt(a^2p^2,a^2 ,  )  =  _ t(a^2 p^2 )  +   .",
    "first @xmath5-invariant ( and the only one indeed relevant in our analysis ) .",
    "thus , we first average over any combination of momenta being invariant under @xmath5 ( @xmath5 orbit ) and extrapolate then to the `` continuum case '' , where the effect of @xmath11}$ ] must vanish , by applying for all the orbits sharing the same value of @xmath12 , with the only assumption that the slope depends smoothly on @xmath13 and can be fitted to a polynomial form from the whole set of lattice data . furthermore ,",
    "the @xmath5-artefact - free lattice coupling , @xmath14 might differ from the continuum coupling by some @xmath15-invariant artefacts , as shown for example in the lattice analysis of the quark - propagator renormalization constant  @xcite .",
    "this leads us finally to write : [ eq : a2p2 ] _ t(a^2",
    "p^2 )  =  _ t(p^2 )  +  c_a2p2  a^2 p^2  +  o(a^4 )  , where @xmath16 should be fitted from the lattice data and verify the appropriate scaling from the simulations with different bare couplings , @xmath17 ; while @xmath18 is the lattice prediction to be compared with the continuum ope formula for the taylor strong coupling  @xcite , [ alphahnp ] _",

    "@xcite , one can take advantage of the @xmath21-computations for the wilson coefficients in ref .",
    "@xcite , and obtains    r(,_0 ) = ( 1 + 1.18692 + 1.45026 ^2 + 2.44980 ^3 )  ( 1 - 0.54994 _ 0 - 0.13349 _ 0 ^ 2 - 0.10955_0 ^ 3 )  ,    for @xmath22 gev .",
    "the purely perturbative running in is given up to four - loops by  @xcite @xmath23 with @xmath24 and the coefficients of the @xmath17-function in taylor - scheme  @xcite .",
    "as for the @xmath25 parameters in taylor - scheme and @xmath26 , they are related through  @xcite [ rattms ]  = e^-  =  0.560832  , for the @xmath20 case   is gauge - dependent , @xmath27 is not .",
    "of course , the conversion factor of both parameters to each other is also gauge - dependent .",
    "then , as far as this conversion factor can be exactly determined because of the rge invariance of @xmath28 , the choice of any gauge for the lattice determination of @xmath29 ( landau gauge in our case ) is irrespective for the final determination of @xmath27 .",

    "[ fig : plotfin ] corresponds to the r.h.s of with the value for the landau - gauge gluon condensate taken from .",
    "one should notice that the departure from zero for the lattice data in the plot can be only explained by non - perturbative contributions .",
    "furthermore , the wilson coefficient for the landau - gauge gluon condensate in the ope expansion successfully accounts for the non - flat behaviour from the lattice data in the small coupling regime .",
    "this provides with a striking indication that ( and where ) the ope analysis is in order .",
    "next , in the bottom - left plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : plotfin ] , we show the departure of the lattice data from the prediction given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : a2p2],[alphahnp ] ) , plotted in terms of the momentum in units of @xmath43 , with logarithmic scales for both axes .",
    "the data seem to indicate that the next - to - leading non - perturbative correction is highly dominated by an @xmath44 term .",
    "this is just a factual statement which might suggest either that the @xmath45 ope contributions are negligible when compared with the @xmath44 ones or that the product of the leading @xmath45 terms and the involved wilson coefficients leave with an effective @xmath44 behaviour .",
    "one might also guess that a different non - perturbative mechanism dominates over the momentum window where the dimension - four ope condensates had to be visible .",

    "the two main purposes of this paper are to show the impact of the ope power corrections in describing the running of the strong coupling and to give an estimate for @xmath0 from lattice qcd simulations with a dynamical charm quark .",

    "more precise estimates for these systematics uncertainties will be accessible with more data ( more simulations at different @xmath17 s and for more light quark masses ) .",
    "finally , the value for @xmath49 and the four - loop perturbative running with the appropriate crossing of the bottom mass threshold at @xmath50gev  @xcite can be used to estimate the value of the coupling at the @xmath51 mass , _",
    "s(m_z^0 )  =  0.1198(9)(5)^+0_-5  ; where the errors have been properly propagated .",
    "this is a first result that will be refined , mainly by improving the precision for the estimates of systematic uncertainties .",
    "however , it appears to be pretty compatible with the last world average given by pdg  @xcite : 0.1184(7 ) .",
    "although a more detailed comparison of our result with pdg average and a discussion of its implications will be left for a phenomenologically targeted forthcoming letter , we should remark that our result including strange and charm dynamical quarks ( @xmath522 + 1 + 1 ) appears to be slightly larger than the lattice estimate for @xmath1=2 + 1 staggered fermions , applied to obtain the pdg average : @xmath53  @xcite . assuming no systematic effect to appear from the different fermion actions , the meaning for the 1-@xmath54 discrepancy of both central values ,",
    "if any , can be explained from the procedure applied to cross the threshold from @xmath1=2 + 1 to @xmath1=2 + 1 + 1 flavours .",
    "that procedure is very well established and controlled in perturbation theory  @xcite , but some non - perturbative effects may still appear at the charm quark running mass .    indeed , if we compare the result of @xmath27 for @xmath7 in ref .",
    "@xcite , the central value ranging from 310 to 330 mev ( depending on the lattice size calibration at different values of @xmath17 ) , with that for @xmath1=2 + 1 + 1 in this paper , it can be concluded that the effect for the running coupling of crossing the strange or charm quark thresholds is not very significant ) and @xmath7 lattice results for @xmath27 ( once lattice spacing is calibrated from @xmath55 ) was observed . in that case ,",
    "simulations for infinite ( quenching ) and vanishing ( chiral limit ) quark flavours were compared , although it is well known that the chiral lmit for the quenched case is wrong . on the contrary , when comparing @xmath1=2 + 1 + 1 and @xmath1=2 ( or @xmath1=2 + 1 ) cases , we deal with infinitely massive flavours ( s and c ) in the latter and heavy ( c ) or mid - heavy ( s ) in the former",
    ". then , not to see the same significant effect can not be too surprising . ] on @xmath27 .",
    "on the other hand , applying just the perturbative recipe to cross the charm quark threshold would result in a stronger decreasing of @xmath27 from @xmath1=2 + 1 to @xmath1=2 + 1 + 1 flavours .",
    "thus , an enhancement for the estimate of @xmath56 obtained from the @xmath1=2 + 1 + 1 lattice result for @xmath27 can be understood when comparing to the one obtained by applying that perturbative recipe to cross the charm quark threshold with the @xmath1=2 + 1 lattice result .",
    "we used lattice gauge field configurations with two degenerate light and one heavy doublet of twisted mass flavors , produced within the framework of etm collaboration , to compute the running strong coupling in the mom taylor scheme . in this particular renormalization scheme",
    ", the lattice computation of this coupling has the very nice feature of involving only propagators .",
    "this allows for a very precise control of the lattice artefacts and other systematic uncertainties .",
    "in particular , the so - called @xmath5-extrapolation procedure which has already been proved to be very effective at eliminating the discretization artefacts of two - point correlation functions is efficiently at work in this analysis .",
    "the dominant @xmath15 artefact is also rather easily isolated and eliminated . on the other hand , the renormalized coupling , defined in mom taylor scheme by the combination of the ghost and gluon bare propagators , must only depend on the uv cut - off through residual contributions vanishing at the infinite cut - off limit .",
    "thus , the taylor coupling computed from the lattice must join the continuum prediction at this infinite cut - off limit .",
    "this is also a strong point to cure properly lattice artefacts and get reliable results .",
    "thus , we evaluated the running strong coupling over a rather large window of lattice momenta and , after the appropriate relative calibration , confront it with the perturbative prediction available at the four - loop level .",
    "we clearly demonstrate the necessity to include non - perturbative power corrections to get an accurate description for the behaviour of the coupling constant .",
    "we then show these corrections follow the ope predictions when a non - vanishing dimension - two landau - gauge gluon condensate is present .",
    "this is to our knowledge the first time a wilson coefficient is directly confronted to numerical results .",
    "higher order terms are visible and seem to be dominated by @xmath44 contributions instead of the expected @xmath45 ones .    the precise comparison of lattice estimates with continuum formula allows the estimate of both the gluon condensate and @xmath0 .",
    "the latter is in a very good agreement with the world average of its experimental determinations provided by pdg , confirming that the picture we advanced , first by the analysis of quenched lattice data and next by studying lattice simulations with two twisted - mass flavours , agrees very well with the real world when a full qcd analysis is performed including a heavy doublet for strange and charm quarks .",
    "going the other way around , with the experimental value for @xmath0 as an input , this approach could be used to provide quite good absolute determinations of the lattice spacings .",
    "relative measurements ( ratio of lattice spacings ) through the superimposition of the different curves for @xmath57 over a large window can be also obtained with a good level of precision .",
    "the perturbative running from our results up to the z boson mass is well known in perturbation theory and we apply the standard formula  @xcite to cross the b quark threshold .",
    "_ we do not need to consider the charm quark threshold since , for the first time to our knowledge , we have used dynamical charm in our computation .",
    "this is a very significant gain : the crossing of the charm threshold using perturbative qcd is quite questionable , since , as we have seen , non - perturbative effects ( ope power terms ) are sizeable at this energy . _    further works are in progress . in particular data with different masses at @xmath1=2",
