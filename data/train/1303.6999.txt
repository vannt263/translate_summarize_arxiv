    "markov processes with switching are intensively used for modelling purposes in applied subjects like biology @xcite , storage modelling @xcite , neuronal activity @xcite .",
    "this class of markov processes is reminiscent of the so - called iterated random functions @xcite or branching processes in random environment @xcite in the discrete time setting .",
    "several recent works @xcite deal with their long time behaviour ( existence of an invariant probability measure , harris recurrence , exponential ergodicity , hypoellipticity ... ) .",
    "in particular , in @xcite , the authors provide a kind of hypoellipticity criterion with hrmander - like bracket conditions . under these conditions ,",
    "they deduce the uniqueness and absolute continuity of the invariant measure , provided that a suitable tightness condition is satisfied .",
    "they also obtain geometric convergence in the total variation distance .",
    "nevertheless , there are many simple processes with switching which do not verify any hypoellipticity condition .",
    "to illustrate this fact , let us consider the simple example of @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be the markov process on @xmath1 generated by @xmath2 this process is ergodic and the first marginal @xmath3 of its invariant measure is supported on @xmath4 .",
    "thus , in general , it does not converge in the total variation distance .",
    "however , it is proved in @xcite that it converges in a certain wasserstein distance .",
    "let us recall that the wasserstein distance on a polish space @xmath5 is defined by @xmath6,\\ ] ] for every probability measure @xmath7 , @xmath8 on @xmath9 , where the infimum is taken over all pairs of random variables @xmath10 , @xmath11 with respective laws @xmath7 , @xmath8 . the kantorovich - rubinstein duality ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  5.10 ) shows that one also has @xmath12 where @xmath13 is in @xmath14 if and only if it is a @xmath15-lipschitz function , namely @xmath16 the total variation distance @xmath17 can be viewed as the wasserstein distance associated to the trivial distance function , namely @xmath18 where the infimum is again taken over all random variables @xmath10 , @xmath11 with respective distributions @xmath7 , @xmath8 . in the present article , we will give convergence criteria for a general class of switching markov processes .",
    "these processes are built from the following ingredients :    * a polish space @xmath5 and a finite set @xmath19 ; * a family @xmath20 of @xmath9-valued strong markov processes represented by their semigroups @xmath21 , or equivalently by their generators @xmath22 with domains @xmath23 ; * a family @xmath24 of non - negative functions on @xmath9 .",
    "we are interested by the process @xmath25 , defined on @xmath26 , which jumps between these dynamics . roughly speaking",
    ", @xmath27 behaves like @xmath28 as long as @xmath29 does not jump .",
    "the process @xmath29 is discrete and jumps at a rate given by @xmath30 .",
    "more precisely , the dynamics of @xmath31 is as follows :    * given a starting point @xmath32 , we take for @xmath33 an instance as above with initial condition @xmath34 .",
    "the initial conditions for @xmath35 with @xmath36 are irrelevant .",
    "* the discrete component @xmath29 is constant and equal to @xmath37 until the time @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a family of random variables that are conditionally independent given @xmath33 and that verify @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "* for all @xmath42 , we then set @xmath43 and @xmath44 . * at time @xmath45 , there exists a unique @xmath46 such that @xmath47 and we set @xmath48 and @xmath49 . * we take @xmath50 as a new starting point at time @xmath45 .",
    "let us make a few remarks about this construction .",
    "first , this algorithm guarantees the existence of our process under the condition that there is no explosion in the switching rate .",
    "in other words , our construction is global as long as @xmath29 only switches value finitely many time in any finite time interval .",
    "assumption  [ hyp : a - reg ] below will be sufficient to guarantee this non - explosion . also note that , in general , @xmath51 and @xmath29 are not markov processes by themselves , contrary to @xmath52",
    "nevertheless , we have that @xmath29 is a markov process if @xmath30 does not depend on its first component .",
    "the construction given above shows that , provided that there is no explosion , the infinitesimal generator of @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 for any bounded function @xmath54 such that @xmath55 belongs to @xmath56 for every @xmath57 .",
    "we will denote by @xmath58 the semigroup of @xmath52 . to guarantee the existence of our process",
    ", we will consider the following natural assumption :    [ hyp : a - reg ] the following boundedness condition is verified : @xmath59 and the following lipschitz condition is also verified : @xmath60 for some @xmath61 .",
    "we will also assume the following hypothesis to guarantee the recurrence of @xmath29 :    [ hyp : rec ] the matrix @xmath62 defined by @xmath63 yields the transition rates of an irreducible and recurrent markov chain .    with these two assumptions , we are able to get exponential stability in two situations .",
    "the first situation is one where each underlying dynamics does on average yield a contraction in some wasserstein distance , but no regularising assumption is made .",
    "the second situation is the opposite , where we replace the contraction by a suitable regularising property .      in this section",
    ", we assume that we have some information on the lipschitz contraction ( or expansion ) of our underlying processes :    [ hypo : curv ] for each @xmath57 , there exists @xmath64 such that @xmath65 for any two probability measures @xmath66 . furthermore there exist @xmath67 and @xmath68 such that if @xmath69 then @xmath70 } p_t v_{x_0 } ( x_0 ) < + \\infty.\\ ] ]    to verify equation is not much of a restriction because we do not assume that @xmath71 .",
    "the best constant in this inequality is called the wasserstein curvature in @xcite and the coarse ricci curvature in @xcite , since it is heavily related to the geometry of the underlying space as illustrated in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2 ) .",
    "if @xmath72 , then we can deduce some properties like geometric ergodicity , a poincar inequality or some concentration inequalities @xcite . a trivial bound on @xmath73",
    "is given in the special case of diffusion processes in section  [ sect : dif ] .",
    "the bound is quite stringent since , if @xmath72 , it implies that there is some wasserstein contraction for _ every _ @xmath74 and not just for sufficiently long times .",
    "this is essentially equivalent to the existence of a markovian coupling between two instances @xmath27 and @xmath75 of the markov process with generator @xmath76 such that @xmath77 .    in principle , this condition could be slightly relaxed by the addition of a proportionality constant @xmath78 , provided that one assumes that the switching rate of the process is sufficiently slow .",
    "this ensures that , most of the time , it spends a sufficiently long time in any one state for this proportionality constant not to play a large role .",
    "one could also imagine allowing for jumps of the component in @xmath9 at the switching times , and this would lead to a similar difficulty . in the same way , the distance @xmath79 appearing in assumption  [ hypo : curv ]",
    "is the _ same _ for every @xmath37 and that it does not allow for a constant prefactor in the right hand side of .",
    "this may seem like a very strong assumption since usual convergence theorems , like harris theorem , do not give this kind of bound .",
    "we will see however in section  [ sect : exemple ] an example which illustrates that there is no obvious way in general to weaken this condition .",
    "the intuitive reason why this is so is that if the process switches rapidly , then it is crucial to have some local information ( small times ) and not only global information ( large times ) on the behaviour of each underlying dynamics .",
    "we now have presented all the assumptions that are necessary to state our main results .",
    "the first one describes the simplest situation , that is when @xmath30 does not depend on its first component :    [ th : w - cst ] under assumptions [ hyp : a - reg ] , [ hyp : rec ] and [ hypo : curv ] , if @xmath80 does not depend on @xmath81 and the markov process @xmath29 has an invariant probability measure @xmath82 verifying @xmath83 then there exist a probability measure @xmath84 and some constants @xmath85 such that @xmath86 for every @xmath87 , where the distance @xmath88 , on @xmath89 , is defined by @xmath90 for every @xmath91 , @xmath92 belonging to @xmath89 , @xmath93 is as in assumption  [ hypo : curv ] and @xmath94 $ ] .",
    "this statement is not surprising : it states that if the process contracts in mean , then it converges exponentially to an invariant distribution .",
    "the conditions are rather sharp as will be illustrated in section  [ sect : exemple ] .",
    "in particular , we recover ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  1.10 ) and this ( slight ) generalisation could be deduced from the argument given there .",
    "using hlder s inequality , we can also deduce convergence in the @xmath95 wasserstein distance @xmath96 with @xmath97 provided that @xmath52 satisfies a moment condition .",
    "we give the previous theorem and its proof for sake of completeness and for a better understanding of the more complicated case , where @xmath30 is allowed to depend on its first argument . that is    [ th :",
    "w - noncst ] let us suppose that assumptions [ hyp : a - reg ] , [ hyp : rec ] , and [ hypo : curv ] hold .",
    "we set @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100 if @xmath101",
    "then there exist a probability measure @xmath84 and some constants @xmath85 such that @xmath86 for every @xmath87 , where the distance @xmath88 , on @xmath89 , is defined in , @xmath93 is as in assumption  [ hypo : curv ] and @xmath94 $ ] .    with this result",
    ", we not only recover ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  1.15 ) , but we extend it significantly . in our case ,",
    "the underlying dynamics are not necessarily deterministic and do not need to be strictly contracting in a wasserstein distance .",
    "one drawback is that the constants @xmath102 and @xmath103 are much less explicit .",
    "this theorem is a direct consequence of the more general theorem  [ th : w - noncst2 ] below .",
    "these two theorems are our main result and , contrary to the previous theorem , it seems that they can not be deduced directly from the approach of @xcite .      in the previous subsection",
    ", we have supposed that some of the underlying dynamics contract at sufficiently high rate in a wasserstein distance .",
    "this is of course not a necessary condition for geometric ergodicity in general . using some arguments of the proof of theorem  [ th : w - cst ] and theorem  [ th : w - noncst ] , we can deduce a different criterion which uses instead a lyapunov - type argument to prove that @xmath52 converges .",
    "we begin by stating an assumption similar to assumption  [ hypo : curv ] :    [ hyp : lyap ] there exist @xmath104 , a function @xmath105 , and for every @xmath106 there exists @xmath107 such that @xmath108    note again that we have not supposed that @xmath109 .",
    "one way to prove this kind of bound is to use the classical drift condition on the generator ( see below ) . with this assumption",
    "we are able to prove    [ th : dtv - cst ] suppose that assumptions [ hyp : a - reg ] , [ hyp : rec ] and [ hyp : lyap ] hold , that @xmath80 does not depend on @xmath81 and that @xmath29 has an invariant probability measure @xmath82 verifying @xmath110 if there exists @xmath111 such that the sublevel sets of @xmath112 are small for @xmath113 , then there exist a probability measure @xmath84 and two constants @xmath114 such that @xmath115 for every @xmath116 .",
    "the definition of a small set is recalled in definition  [ def : small ] .",
    "we give also the analogous of theorem  [ th : w - noncst ] :    [ th : dtv - noncst ] let us suppose that assumptions [ hyp : a - reg ] , [ hyp : rec ] , [ hypo : curv ] hold .",
    "we set @xmath117 @xmath118 @xmath100 if @xmath119 and there exists @xmath111 such that the sublevel sets of @xmath112 are small for @xmath113 , then there exist a probability measure @xmath84 and two constants @xmath114 such that @xmath115 for every @xmath116 .",
    "note that in general it is not necessary to assume that sublevel sets of @xmath112 are small for any single one of the underlying dynamics .",
    "for example , using the results of @xcite , section  [ sect : pdmp ] gives results analogous to the two previous theorems , in the special case of piecewise deterministic markov processes where the only small sets for the underlying dynamics consist of single points .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organised as follows .",
    "the proofs of our four main theorems are split over two sections : section  [ sect : cst ] deals with the proof of theorem  [ th : w - cst ] and theorem  [ th : dtv - cst ] . in section",
    "[ sect : non - cst ] , we begin by giving a more general assumption in the non - constant case than our on - off criterion . then , we introduce a weak form of harris theorem that we will use to prove theorem  [ th : w - noncst ] .",
    "the proof of this theorem is then decomposed in such a way to verify each point of the weak harris theorem .",
    "section  [ sect : dif ] gives sufficient conditions to verify our main assumption in the special case of diffusion processes .",
    "the section which follows deals with the special case of switching dynamical system .",
    "we conclude with section  [ sect : exemple ] , where we give some very simple examples illustrating the sharpness of our conditions .",
    "in this section , we begin by proving that under assumptions [ hypo : curv ] or [ hyp : lyap ] , the process @xmath52 can not wander off to infinity , i.e.  its semigroup possesses a lyapunov function .",
    "we then prove theorems [ th : w - cst ] and [ th : dtv - cst ] using a similar argument to @xcite for the first one and harris theorem for the second one .",
    "we begin by recalling the definition of a lyapunov function    [ def : lyap ] a lyapunov function for a markov semigroup @xmath120 over a polish space @xmath121 is a function @xmath122 $ ] such that @xmath112 is integrable with respect to @xmath123 for every @xmath124 and @xmath125 and such that there exist constants @xmath126 verifying @xmath127 for every @xmath128 and @xmath129 .    a well know sufficient condition for finding a lyapunov function is the following drift condition : @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the generator of the semigroup @xmath132 .",
    "the condition implies a bound like and is clearly stronger than . in general",

    ", we first prove that a wasserstein contraction as in assumption  [ hypo : curv ] implies the existence of a lyapunov - type function as in assumption  [ hyp : lyap ] .",
    "then , we will prove that assumption  [ hyp : lyap ] implies the existence of a lyapunov function for @xmath52 .",
    "[ lem : curv - lyap ] let @xmath132 be the semigroup of a markov process , on a polish space @xmath121 , such that there exists @xmath133 verifying @xmath134 for every @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "if there exist @xmath67 and @xmath68 such that the function @xmath69 verifies    _ t p_t v_x_0 ( x_0 ) < + ,    then there exist @xmath137 such that @xmath138 for every @xmath124 and @xmath136 .    for any @xmath139 and @xmath140 , it follows from that @xmath141 taking @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the integer part of @xmath144 , we conclude that @xmath145 } \\frac{p_{u } v_{x_0 } ( x_0)}{|e^{-\\lambda u } -1|},\\ ] ] which is finite by . finally , for every @xmath124 and @xmath146 , we have @xmath147 thus concluding the proof .",
    "we deduce that assumption  [ hypo : curv ] implies assumption  [ hyp : lyap ] with @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
