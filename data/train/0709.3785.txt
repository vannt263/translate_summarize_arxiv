    "tropical geometry is a new and active field of research .",
    "roughly , its main idea is to replace algebraic varieties by piece - wise linear objects called tropical varieties .",
    "these objects may be easier to deal with and new methods from combinatorics can be used to handle them .",
    "a lot of work has been done to `` translate '' terms and definitions to the tropical world .",
    "sometimes a translation is justified by the appropriate use of the new tropical object rather than by an argument why this is the correct tropicalization .",
    "this is the case for the @xmath0-invariant of an elliptic curve .",
    "many results predict that the `` tropical @xmath0-invariant '' of a tropical curve of genus one is its cycle length .",
    "the @xmath0-invariant is an invariant which coincides for two smooth elliptic curves over an algebraically closed fields if and only if they are isomorphic . in @xcite ,",
    "isomorphisms ( `` equivalences '' ) between abstract tropical curves are defined , and two elliptic abstract tropical curves are equivalent if and only if they have the same cycle length .",
    "thus the cycle length plays the same role in the tropical setting as the @xmath0-invariant does in the algebraic setting .",
    "also , the possibility to define a group law on the cycle of a tropical curve ( see @xcite ) using distances indicates the importance of the cycle and its length .",
    "furthermore , the numbers of tropical curves with fixed cycle length are in correspondence to the numbers of curves with fixed @xmath0-invariant ( see @xcite ) .",
    "but there is also a result which suggests that the cycle length actually might be the correct tropicalization of the @xmath0-invariant ( as introduced on p.  ) .",
    "this is a byproduct of the proof of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.4.1 ) .",
    "it says that given a tropical curve @xmath1 with cycle length @xmath2 and a puiseux series @xmath0 of valuation @xmath3 , we can embed the elliptic curve with @xmath0-invariant @xmath0 such that its tropicalization is equal to @xmath1 .",
    "all these results indicate that the `` tropical @xmath0-invariant '' should be defined as the cycle length ( respectively , its negative ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that for a plane cubic the @xmath0-invariant really tropicalizes to the negative of the cycle length .",
    "more precisely , we define plane cubic curves over the field of puiseux series @xmath4 and use the valuation map to tropicalize them ( see p.  ) . the @xmath0-invariant of an elliptic curve over the puiseux series is a puiseux series itself .",
    "our main theorem ( see theorem [ thm - main ] ) is that the negative of the cycle length of the tropicalization of a smooth cubic curve in @xmath5 ( assuming it has a cycle  see definition [ def - cycle ] ) is always equal to the generic valuation of the @xmath0-invariant ( see definition [ def - genericvaluation ] ) and it is actually equal to the valuation of the @xmath0-invariant itself if no terms in the @xmath0-invariant cancel  which generically is the case .",
    "a corollary ( see corollary [ cor - nocycle ] ) of this theorem is that if an elliptic curve has a @xmath0-invariant with a positive valuation , then its tropicalization does not have a cycle .",
    "there is an intriguing similarity to bad reduction of elliptic curves over discrete valuation rings .",
    "firstly , only elliptic curves whose @xmath0-invariant has a negative valuation have bad reduction , and secondly the negative of this valuation is then the `` cycle length '' of the special fiber in the nron model of the curve in the sense that it is the number of projective lines forming the cycle .",
    "we are working on better understanding of the connection of these two results .",
    "moreover , in a forthcoming paper we will show that the main result of this paper can be generalized to smooth elliptic curves on toric surfaces other than the projective plane .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec - jinv ]",
    "we recall the definition of the @xmath0-invariant of a plane cubic as a rational function in the cubic s coefficients .",
    "its denominator is the discriminant of the cubic .",
    "moreover , we observe that the generic valuation ( see definition [ def - genericvaluation ] ) of the @xmath0-invariant is a piece - wise linear function . in section [ sec - trop ]",
    "we recall basic definitions of tropical geometry and show that the function `` cycle length '' is piece - wise linear as well .",
    "the main theorem is stated in section [ sec - thm ] . as we know",
    "already that the two functions we want to compare are piece - wise linear the proof consists of two main steps : first we compare certain domains of linearity , then we compare the two linear functions on each domain .",
    "we present two proofs since we believe that each of them is interesting on its own .",
    "for the first proof , we choose as domains of linearity the union of @xmath6-equivalent cones of the secondary fan of @xmath7 ( i.e.  cones of the grbner fan of the discriminant ) .",
    "the comparison of the two linear functions `` generic valuation of the @xmath0-invariant '' and `` cycle length '' on each such cone is done in section [ sec - delta ] . in the second proof ,",
    "we choose smaller domains of linearity  cones of the secondary fan of @xmath8 .",
    "to compare the two linear functions , we have to classify the rays of the secondary fan of @xmath8 and compare them on each ray .",
    "section [ sec - rays ] is concerned with this classification of the rays of the secondary fan of @xmath8 . in section [ sec - discriminant ]",
    "we give an alternative proof of the fact that for an arbitrary convex lattice polytope the grbner fan of the discriminant is a coarsening of the secondary fan , and in section [ sec - num ] we study the numerator of the @xmath0-invariant .",
    "these two sections are important to understand the domains of linearity of the function `` generic valuation of the @xmath0-invariant ''",
    ".    parts of our proofs and many examples rely on computations performed using ` polymake ` @xcite , topcom @xcite and singular @xcite .",
    "the singular code that we used for this is contained in the library ` jinvariant.lib ` ( see @xcite ) and it is available via the url    http://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/~keilen/en/jinvariant.html .",
    "more detailed explanations on how to use the code can be found there .",
    "the authors would like to acknowledge vladimir berkovich , jordan ellenberg , bjorn poonen , david speyer , charles staats , bernd sturmfels and john voigt for valuable discussions .",
    "since every smooth elliptic curve can be embedded into the projective plane as a cubic it makes sense to start the investigation of smooth elliptic curves and their tropicalizations by studying cubics in the plane . and since the tropicalization of a curve highly depends on its embedding we want to consider all such planar embeddings of a given curve at the same time . that is , we start with a non - zero homogeneous polynomial @xmath9 of degree @xmath10 as input data . here",

    "since the tropicalization of @xmath16 only depends on the points of @xmath16 in the torus @xmath17 ( see section [ sec - trop ] ) we may as well replace @xmath15 by its affine equation @xmath18 and we will do so for the remaining part of the paper  always keeping in mind that via homogenization @xmath15 defines a cubic in the projective plane .    in our investigation",
    "the newton polytope of @xmath15 , the triangle @xmath19 with endpoints @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , plays an important role .",
    "we denote by @xmath23 its integer points .",

    "it is enough to compare the linear functions on each cone of the grbner fan of @xmath6 contained in @xmath239 . to do this ,",

    "since the rays of the secondary fan of @xmath8 in question are not necessarily contained in the interior of a top - dimensional cone of the grbner fan of @xmath49 and @xmath6 , we have to use the generic valuation .",
