    "the flipper pilot generates two input signals which goes through the flipper box as explained in the previous section .",
    "the time offset between the two main signals is easily detectable with the oscilloscope and can be corrected tuning the cable length or introducing a delay unit .",
    "a second source of systematics is due to the fact that each main signal is split between 64 channels .",

    "a threshold scan is performed without input .",
    "for very low threshold ( 20 dac , corresponding to @xmath1200 mv ) the hit efficiency is 1 but increasing the threshold it decreases exponentially to zero .",
    "this dependence is studied for each channel aiming to find noisy channels or problems due to bad shielding cover .",
    "about one out of 30 fe@xmath3box are repaired due to this .",
    "drift time information per event is stored in a 4 @xmath7s pipeline buffer in the otis chip waiting for the lo trigger decision .",
