    "calculating the light hadron spectrum from first principles has been one of the main objectives of lattice qcd since its formulation@xcite .",
    "pioneering attempts towards this goal in the quenched approximation@xcite were followed by an increase of understanding and control of various systematic uncertainties due to finite lattice spacing , finite size and the problem of chiral extrapolations .",
    "an outstanding effort carried out by the gf11 collaboration@xcite led to a quenched spectrum agreeing within 510% with experiment . with its history quenched qcd can therefore be considered as a matured field where an additional increase of calculational accuracy will finally tell us how the quenched spectrum deviates from experiment .",
    "last year the cp - pacs collaboration presented first results of an effort in this direction@xcite .",
    "the simulation has been completed in the meantime and the final results have been presented at this conference@xcite .",
    "progress in the full qcd spectrum study has been comparatively slower .",
    "even though full qcd simulations have a history almost as long as quenched ones@xcite , the field is still at an exploring stage .",
    "in particular how in detail the spectrum is influenced by the presence of light sea quarks has not yet been fully answered@xcite .",
    "recently the cp - pacs collaboration undertook a further step in the direction of a realistic full qcd simulation . at this conference",
    "first preliminary results have been presented@xcite .    in this article we present an overview of the two calculations of the cp - pacs collaboration described above . in the first part we discuss in detail our final results for the quenched hadron spectrum , devoting some length to the issue of chiral extrapolations . in the second part we switch to full qcd where we present our main results , focussing on whether effects from sea quarks can be seen .",
    "we list the parameters of our quenched simulation in table  [ tab : quench - params ] , where the partition size of the cp - pacs computer employed and the execution time for one cycle of configuration generation and hadron propagator calculations are also given for each lattice size .",
    "the runs are performed on four lattices covering the lattice spacing in the range @xmath04  gev for extrapolation to the continuum limit .",
    "the physical lattice size in the spatial direction is chosen to be around @xmath1  fm where finite size effects are expected to be negligible .",
    "gauge configurations are generated with over - relaxation and heat bath algorithms mixed in a 4:1 ratio .",
    "for each value of @xmath2 quark propagators are calculated for five quark masses corresponding to @xmath3 of about 0.75 , 0.7 , 0.6 , 0.5 and 0.4 .",
    "the first two values are taken to be around the strange quark for interpolation , and the last value is our attempt to control chiral extrapolations better than in previous spectrum studies with the wilson quark action .",
    "we calculate hadron masses for equal as well as unequal quark masses so that we can determine the complete light hadron spectrum with degenerate @xmath4 and @xmath5 quarks and a heavier strange quark .    since lattice 97 we have increased the number of configurations from 91 to 150 at @xmath6 . for technical details of the simulation",
    "we refer to @xcite .    ",
    ".parameters of quenched simulation .",
    "values of @xmath7 are determined from @xmath8 obtained by a quenched chiral perturbation theory fit to vector meson masses . [ cols= \"",
    "< , < , < , < , < , < , > \" , ]     configurations are generated with the hmc algorithm . to speed up our code",
    "we have implemented several improvements . for the integration of molecular dynamics equations",
    "we employ the scheme @xmath9 where @xmath10 moves the gauge field and @xmath11 the conjugate momenta by a step @xmath12 .",
    "this scheme has errors of the same order as the standard leapfrog but the main contribution to the error is removed by the choice @xmath13  @xcite . for our heaviest quarks @xmath12 can be taken about a factor 3 larger than for leapfrog , leading to a 30% gain in computer time .",
    "the gain decreases for decreasing quark masses and is lost at our smallest quark mass . for the inversion of the quark matrix we use the even / odd preconditioned bicgstab algorithm  @xcite .",
    "its performance compared to mr increases with decreasing quark mass .",
    "we observe a gain of about 40% at @xmath14 .",
    "cpu times needed for the creation of one unit of trajectory and numbers of processors are listed in table  [ tab : full - params ] .",
    "the light hadron spectrum is calculated at each sea quark mass with valence quark masses corresponding to @xmath15 , 0.75 , 0.7 , 0.6 and 0.5 .",
    "quark propagators are calculated with exponentially smeared sources and local sinks .",
    "we combine quark propagators to form mesons of the form @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 and baryons of the form @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 where @xmath23 stands for a valence quark with @xmath24 and @xmath25 for a valence quark with @xmath26 .",
    "these combinations include all unequal quark mass combinations allowed for degenerate @xmath4 and @xmath5 sea quarks and valence @xmath27 quark .",
    "= 7.5 cm = 7.5 cm    we measure hadron propagators at every 5th trajectory .",
    "hadron masses are extracted by uncorrelated fits .",
    "errors are determined with the binned jackknife method .",
    "the error reaches an approximate plateau after a bin size of at most 10 configurations ( 50 hmc trajectories ) , which we choose for error estimates of all our runs .",
    "figure [ fig : chiral - full ] shows meson masses at @xmath28 as a function of the average hopping parameter @xmath29 of the two valence quarks in the meson .",
    "partially quenched data ( @xmath18 and @xmath17 ) lie along clearly distinct lines for each @xmath30 .",
    "each of these mass results are almost linear for both pseudoscalar and vector mesons , but their slope shows a variation with @xmath30 . with decreasing sea quark mass we observe a decreasing slope for pseudoscalar mesons and an increasing slope for vector mesons .",
    "while the pseudoscalar meson mass in the @xmath16 channel is almost linear in @xmath31 , the vector meson mass exhibits a clear concave curvature .",
    "the picture for decuplet baryons looks very similar to the one for vector mesons , whereas for octet baryons partially quenched data of different degeneracies lie on clearly different lines .    for chiral extrapolations we fit at each value of @xmath2 all the data of a given channel together in a combined fit with a general quadratic ansatz in @xmath31 and @xmath32 . for pseudoscalar mesons consisting of valence quarks `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' ,",
    "the fit ansatz is @xmath33 where bare quark masses are defined as @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the average valence quark mass .",
    "the valence - valence cross term @xmath36 is introduced to take into account mass differences of mesons at the same average valence quark mass . for vector mesons and decuplet baryons such a term is dropped because we observe them to be well described as a function of the sea quark mass and the average valence quark mass only .",
    "curves of the combined fit are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : chiral - full ] for meson masses .    for octet baryons we employ a combined quadratic fit for @xmath37-like and @xmath38-like baryons simultaneously .",
    "linear terms are taken in a form inspired by chiral perturbation theory and general quadratic terms of individual @xmath39 are added .",
    "the resulting ansatz has 12 parameters which fits the 84 octet baryon mass data per @xmath2 value well .",
    "= 7.5 cm    = 7.5 cm    = 7.5 cm    using the results from the combined quadratic fits , the physical light quark hopping parameter @xmath40 and the lattice scale @xmath7 are fixed with the experimental value of @xmath41 and @xmath42 as input .",
    "the valence strange quark hopping parameter @xmath43 ( at @xmath44 ) is determined from either @xmath45 or @xmath46 .",
    "the light hadron spectrum is calculated by setting @xmath30 to @xmath40 , and @xmath47 to either @xmath40 or @xmath43 depending on the quark content of the particle .",
    "the resulting hadron masses as a function of the lattice spacing are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cont - full ] . in the next section",
    "we discuss these results , focussing on what extent dynamical sea quark effects can be seen in comparison to the results from our simulation of quenched qcd with the standard action , plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cont - full ] by open symbols .",
    "an interesting result which stands out in fig .  [ fig : cont - full ] is that the @xmath48 and @xmath49 masses from the full qcd simulation lie higher than those of the quenched results at finite lattice spacing , and that they extrapolate to values in the continuum limit considerably closer to experiment .",
    "if one makes a linear continuum extrapolation as shown by dashed lines , the difference from the experimental value is decreased by about 60% compared to quenched qcd .",
    "the expected leading scaling violation for the tadpole - improved sw quark action is @xmath50 .",
    "we also try such an extrapolation , which yields similar results .",
    "the origin of the remaining difference from experiment is an interesting issue .",
    "one possible reason is that sea quark masses explored in the simulation ( @xmath51 ) are still relatively heavy so that sea quark effects are only partly operative",
    ". we should also remember that our simulation treats only two quark flavours as dynamical .",
    "therefore , another possibility is that at least part of the difference reflects the quenched treatment of the strange quark .",
    "it is interesting to see in detail how the difference between quenched and full qcd arises as a function of the sea quark mass .",
    "the @xmath52 parameter @xmath53 at @xmath54 @xcite is a measure of the meson hyperfine splitting around the strange quark . with the strange quark treated in the partially quenched approximation the derivative",
    "is evaluated at fixed sea quark mass by varying the valence quark mass only .",
    "decreasing the sea quark from a large value down to the light quark mass interpolates between quenched and two - flavour full qcd .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : j - full ] we plot @xmath52 as a function of the sea quark mass ( in the plot the mass squared of the pseudoscalar meson consisting of two sea quarks is used ) .",
    "we find the values to be approximately constant for moderate or large sea quark masses and roughly consistent with the quenched value 0.346(22 ) in the limit of infinitely heavy sea quarks .",
    "only when the sea quark mass becomes close to the chiral limit the value of @xmath52 rises toward the experimental value of 0.48 , resulting in an increase of the hyperfine splitting .",
    "= 7.5 cm    sea quark effects on baryons are less clear . while scaling violation appears small for baryon mass results ,",
    "the errors are still too large to reliably discuss continuum extrapolations and how the two - flavour results compare with those of quenched qcd .",
    "furthermore there are two points that have to be kept in mind : ( i ) the spatial lattice size at the smallest lattice spacing turned out to be 1.9  fm compared to 2.52.6  fm at the two coarser lattice spacings .",
    "these are smaller than the size of 3  fm for our quenched simulation , and raises the question of finite - size effects .",
    "( ii ) the smallest valence quark mass for full qcd corresponds to @xmath55 rather than @xmath56 for quenched qcd , possibly leading to systematic errors in chiral extrapolations of baryon masses .",
    "further work matching these points is needed to clarify sea quark effects in the baryon mass spectrum .      in full qcd the string between a static quark and antiquark",
    "can break and one would expect to observe a flattening of the potential at large distances .",
    "= 7.3 cm    we extract the value of the potential between static quarks @xmath57 from smeared wilson loops . at @xmath28",
    "we also measure the mass of the static - light pseudoscalar meson @xmath58 with the light quark mass equal to the sea quark mass . in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential - full ] these two quantities are compared for the lightest sea quark mass at @xmath59 .",
    "the linear increase of the potential continues beyond the crossing point with @xmath60 at around 1 fm .",
    "a similar situation is found also at other sea quark masses .",
    "we therefore see no indication for string breaking , similar to the findings of previous lattice simulations@xcite .",
    "a possible explanation of this result is that the wilson loop does not have a sufficient overlap with the state of a broken string . in @xcite",
    "we argue , that in order to find the true ground state one would have to extract the potential from wilson loops at a large time separation .",
    "this is difficult in practice because of the rapidly vanishing signal in the noise .",
    "one would have to use ( an ) operator(s ) with a better overlap with a static - light meson pair state .",
    "this is also the essence of other recent proposals@xcite .",
    "a quantity in which clear sea quark effects can be seen is the coulomb coefficient @xmath61 . here",
    "the full qcd results are larger than quenched , and they increase with decreasing sea quark mass .",
    "the magnitude of the shift from quenched to full qcd is consistent with expectations for @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "it has been known for some time that light quark masses calculated in two - flavour full qcd take significantly smaller values compared to those in quenched qcd@xcite .",
    "most recently the sesam collaboration@xcite reported @xmath63  mev from their simulation with the standard action at @xmath64 gev ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "they furthermore pointed out that the ratio @xmath66 takes a large value @xmath67 in contrast to the value @xmath68 commonly quoted from chiral perturbation theory .",
    "these results have been obtained with the vwi definition of the quark mass @xmath69 , where @xmath70 , the hopping parameter where the ps meson mass vanishes when valence and sea quarks have the same mass , is substituted for @xmath71 .",
    "it has been suggested@xcite that the use of the partially quenched critical value @xmath72 , defined by @xmath73 with @xmath74 fixed , resolves the problems described above . in two - flavour qcd however , the choice @xmath70 is the most natural one for the average @xmath4 and @xmath5 quark mass @xmath75 , since the sea quarks are identified with the degenerate @xmath4 and @xmath5 quark .",
    "furthermore , @xmath70 and @xmath72 coincide in the continuum limit .",
    "if the difference between them vanishes sufficiently fast when approaching the continuum limit , then also the two @xmath76 will agree .",
    "indeed , calculating @xmath76 in perturbation theory , we find that the difference between the two quark mass definitions vanishes as @xmath77 .",
    "figure [ fig : quark - full]a shows our results for @xmath75 in the @xmath78 scheme at @xmath79  gev , calculated with tadpole - improved one - loop values of renormalization factors@xcite , as a function of the lattice spacing .",
    "the two definitions of @xmath76 lead to significantly different values at finite lattice spacings but as expected they converge towards the continuum limit .",
    "in addition the awi quark mass also extrapolates to a similar value .",
    "the value reached is 2.53 mev , which is about 40% smaller than the result obtained in quenched qcd .",
    "a theoretical argument for a decrease of quark masses by unquenching has been previously made from different running of the @xmath2 function@xcite .",
    "results for the strange quark mass are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : quark - full]b .",
    "the difference between various quark mass definitions is much smaller than for the light quark .",
    "the main uncertainty stems from the choice of the experimental input to fix @xmath43 .",
    "we find values in the continuum limit of about @xmath80 mev ( @xmath45 input ) or 80 mev ( @xmath81 input ) .",
    "the discrepancy between these two values is smaller than in quenched qcd .",
    "the remaining difference might be due to the quenching of the strange quark or that the sea quarks are too heavy .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : quark - full]c we show the ratio of strange to light quark masses as function of the lattice spacing .",
    "while for vwi masses with the choice @xmath82 the value is @xmath83 at the largest lattice spacing , it decreases toward the continuum limit and all definitions converge to @xmath84 , consistent with results .",
    "in our extensive study of the quenched hadron mass spectrum , we found that the mass results show an overall consistency with predictions , which led us to employ mass formulae for chiral extrapolations in our final analysis .",
    "the spectrum in the continuum limit deviate systematically and unambiguously from experiment , on a level of about 10% ( 5@xmath85 ) .",
    "the terms specific to q@xmath86pt , however , have a small magnitude of 23% of hadron masses , and are hence responsible only for a small part of the deviation . while chiral extrapolations differ , our main conclusion remains unchanged since lattice 97 .",
    "our study of full qcd is in a less advanced stage , attempting to systematically approach a realistic qcd simulation .",
    "still , already several intriguing results are found .",
    "the discrepancy in the meson hyperfine splitting is reduced by about 60% and light quark masses are found to be around 40% smaller than in quenched qcd . in the future it will be interesting to look for sea quark effects also in other areas such as topology and heavy quark physics .",
