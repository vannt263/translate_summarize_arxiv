    "the observable part of debris disks are small ( @xmath1 mm ) dusty or icy grains , collisionally produced from larger , undetectable parent bodies . in addition to the gravitational pull of the star , these grains are also affected by several forces such as stellar radiation pressure , poynting - robertson ( pr ) drag and the possible gravitational influence of large bodies in the neighborhood .",
    "as has been shown in numerous numerical studies , the combined effect of these different forces can lead to complex spatial structures in resolved disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a less investigated additional force that could have an influence on grain dynamics is the drag due to particles from the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the effect of ism has first been addressed by @xcite , who studied the level of disk erosion due to sandblasting by ism dust grains .",
    "they concluded that , at least around massive stars , this effect was negligible because small ism grains felt a strong repulsive radiation force .",
    "more recently,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite considered instead the effect of ism _ neutral atoms _ on disk grains .",
    "this flux of neutral atoms acts indeed similarly to the solar wind or radiation pressure from a physical point of view but , being monodirectional , can significantly perturb the trajectories of the grains , and potentially induce asymmetric structures in the disk .",
    "in particular @xcite and @xcite suggest that the ism flux can explain the unusual morphology of some debris disks like hd61005 and hd32997 . in their model",
    "@xcite consider dust particles close to the blow - out size for the star and compute the trajectories of perturbed grains over a timescale of 5000 yrs .",
    "the majority of their grains are strongly perturbed and end up quickly on hyperbolic orbits .",
    "a similar scenario is outlined by @xcite where they concentrate on small grains ( 0.1 @xmath2 m ) whose lifetime before ejection is of the order of a few @xmath3 years .",
    "the morphology changes they observe is mostly due to the fast transfer of grains from low eccentricity orbits into hyperbolic trajectories .    in this paper",
    "we take these studies a step further and we concentrate on the effects of the ism neutral flow on bound keplerian orbits of dust particles in debris disks around solar type stars . the orbital changes on relatively large dust grains ( we model grains with radius ranging from 1 to 10 @xmath2 m )",
    "is slow and it occurs on timescales of the order of @xmath4 yrs .",
    "this timescale is much longer than that considered in @xcite and @xcite and it is related to the larger size of the grains .",
    "in addition , our grains are bound to the star and the orbital evolution induced by the ism flow lead to eccentric and possibly asymmetric disks , characterized by density clumps , only if the collisional lifetime of the grains allows it .",
    "thus , a crucial parameter that controls the efficiency of the ism flow in shaping debris disks is their geometrical optical depth , on which collisional lifetimes directly depend . the collisional cascade that is steadily eroding , by cratering and fragmentation , all solid bodies in a debris disk ,",
    "does indeed reduce the lifetime of dust grains , thus limiting the amount of time their trajectories can be perturbed by non  gravitational forces like radiation pressure ,",
    "pr drag and interaction with ism @xcite . to correctly evaluate the impact of ism on the density profile of a dust disk we thus need to account for the limited lifetime of individual particles and the amount of orbital changes that they can accumulate during that time .",
    "the role of collisions had been discarded by @xcite and @xcite because their dust grains are pushed on hyperbolic trajectories by the ism flow on a very short timescale ( a few @xmath3 years ) , comparable to the collisional lifetime of the particles they handle . in our scenario , grains remain on bound orbits but a simple numerical integration of dust trajectories over a long timespan , performed to predict the overall disk density distribution , can lead to misleading result which are correct only for disks with very low optical depth . a numerical model intended to evaluate the impact of ism on the morphology of dense disks must include an estimate of the lifetime of each individual particle that will be part of the disk only for an interval of time no longer than its collisional lifetime after which it will be replaced by a new one .",
    "if the integration time of the whole particle ensamble is a few times longer than the lifetime of the considered dust particles , we will obtain a stationary relaxed population of grains which will describe in a reliable way the spatial distribution of the debris disk .",
    "we must also account that dust of different sizes would have different lifetimes so the presence of density structures would depend on the size of the dust that is imaged .    the effect of ism neutral atom flux on the dust grain trajectories is twofold . on one side it forces a coupled evolution of eccentricity and pericenter longitude that drives the particles on aligned eccentric orbits . on the other side ,",
    "if the ism flow is inclined with respect to the parent body orbital plane a significant inclination can be pumped up .",
    "in addition , a fast inward migration is forced by the pr drag , which is strong for highly eccentric orbit , and by the ism drag component of the force related to difference between the monodirectional velocity of the ism neutral atoms and the orbital velocity of the dust particles . when they migrate close to the star , the grains either sublimate or impact potential planets or the star itself going lost .",
    "this is an additional sink mechanism , purely dynamical , which contributes to the erosion of the dust population .    in this paper",
    "we intend to address these issues concentrating on the balancing between the orbital evolution of dust grains in dusty disks under the effect of ism neutral atoms perturbations and collisional lifetime .",
    "our goal is to outline the features of the steady state population of dust produced by the combination of these effects .",
    "we will explore the amount of asymmetry in the debris disk created by the ism perturbations and how this depends on the optical depth of the disk .",
    "we concentrate in particular on dust grains of 1 um size since these particles , which are just above the cut - off size imposed by radiation pressure(@xmath5 @xmath2 m ) , are those that dominate the geometrical cross section of the system , and thus the flux coming from the disk in the visible and near - ir ( see for example @xcite ) . we will also give a hint to the evolution of 10 um size particles to test how the density distribution of the disks depends on the observed particle size .",
    "our numerical integration scheme computes the trajectories of a large number of dust particles of a given size using radau @xcite .",
    "it is a very precise algorithm that accurately handles highly eccentric orbits as those produced by ism perturbations .",
    "it is an implicit runge ",
    "kutta integrator of 15th - order which proceeds by sequences within which the substeps are taken at gauss - radau spacings .",
    "high orders of accuracy are obtained with relatively few function evaluations .",
    "in addition , after the first sequence , the information from previous sequences is used to improve the accuracy and the integrator itself chooses the next sequence size depending on the estimated variability of the force term in the differential equations .",
    "non  gravitational forces like radiation pressure and pr drag are included as in @xcite and , in addition , we model the effects of the ism neutral gas atoms adopting the same approach used to calculate the solar wind pressure ( @xcite ) . the acceleration of a dust particle due to the impact with fast neutral atoms of the ism wind is computed as :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the orbital velocity of the dust grain and @xmath8 is the velocity of the ism neutral atoms . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the mass and density of neutral hydrogen atoms , respectively , @xmath11 is the area of the dust particle of radius @xmath12 while @xmath13 is a drag coefficient whose value is about 2.5 .",
    "this functional dependence is robust only in the limit where the gas of the ism has a temperature lower than about 5000 k. under this condition , the thermal speed is lower than @xmath8 and the momentum change is proportional to the @xmath14 . for hot ( @xmath15 ) ism clouds the momentum change would be proportional to @xmath16 @xcite .    for the collisional lifetime of each particle",
    ", we adopt the usual expression    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the local geometrical vertical optical depth of the disk and @xmath19 the orbital period of massless particles at this location ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although detailed numerical studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) show that real collision rates may strongly depart from this simplified expression , we adopt it here for its simplicity and because it is an easy way to tune in the collisional effects .",
    "particle size is a crucial parameter since it determines the response to radiation pressure parameterized by @xmath20 , the ratio of radiation pressure to stellar gravity .",
    "given the steep size distribution for collisional cascades and the limited number of test particles in a deterministic code , it is impossible to consider a wide size range .",
    "we thus restrict our study to several independent simulations each with single size particles .",
    "these different runs can then be combined , when properly weighted , to give a first - order estimate of  real  disks .",
    "we consider a scenario where the central body is a solar type star and the dust grains of the debris disk are the by  product of collisions occurring in a ring of parent bodies ( planetesimals , asteroids , comets ) on circular orbits .",
    "whenever a dust particle is produced , its orbital elements are computed from the position and velocity vectors of the parent body accounting for the reduced gravity @xmath21 due to radiation pressure .",
    "the average collisional lifetime @xmath22 is derived for the particle and , at starting , a random value of age @xmath23 is given to each grain .",
    "as the integration advances , @xmath23 is updated with the timestep @xmath24 .",
    "when @xmath23 becomes larger than the collisional lifetime @xmath22 , the particle is eliminated from the sample and a new one is generated with new orbital elements and @xmath25 .",
    "when the timespan of the integration is a few times longer than @xmath22 we have a steady state population of dust particles where the collisional lifetime determines for how long a grain is subject to non  gravitational perturbations .",
    "in addition , when a particle is injected on a hyperbolic orbit or it has migrated far inside the parent body ring it is discarded and a new one is generated . as a consequence , the steady state population can be due to a balance between the different mechanisms of dust elimination i.e. collisions , ejection out of the system or inwards migration . we assume in our model that the parent bodies are large enough not to be significantly affected by ism .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption since the forces acting on the particles strongly depend on their size .",
    "larger parent bodies would be affected by ism only on a much longer timescale .",
    "we consider as a test case for our modeling a disk produced by a ring of parent bodies evenly distributed in between 50 - 70 au on circular orbits . since the size of the ring is small , assuming a uniform distribution is a good approximation .",
    "we adopt different values for the optical depth of the disk ranging from @xmath26 , typical of dense collision  dominated disks like that around beta pictoris , to @xmath27 for almost collisionless disks similar to the kuiper belt where transport mechanisms like pr drag , stellar or ism winds can dominate . the ism gas flow is approximated as a monodirectional flux moving along the x - axis with a velocity of 20 km / s and a concentration of neutral hydrogen atoms equal to @xmath28 @xmath29 .",
    "these are typical values of the interstellar cloud surrounding our solar system .",
    "the local speed of the sun with respect to the ism is around @xmath30 @xmath31 but some deceleration of the interstellar neutral hydrogen flow across the heliospheric interface is expected reducing the speed to about @xmath32 @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the density we adopt in the numerical model is intermediate between the value given by @xcite equal to@xmath33 @xmath29 and that given in @xcite of @xmath34 @xmath29 .",
    "we first assume that the interstellar gas flow lies on the plane of the parent body ring .",
    "this may be considered a test bench where to study the evolution of the ( @xmath35 ) orbital elements . in effect",
    ", it may not be a realistic scenario since the flow , impinging on one side of the disk , may not reach with equally intensity the other side being eventually absorbed .",
    "this does not occur when there is some inclination between the dust orbits and the ism flow .",
    "however , it is useful to explore the density distribution in the planar case since the structures and clumpings that develop in the @xmath36 plane are retrieved when a low inclination between the flux and the initial dust orbits is assumed . in fig.[f1 ] the position of 1 @xmath37 size particles are given after an evolution lasting about 3 times the average collisional lifetime for the case with @xmath38 ( @xmath39 myr ) and @xmath40 ( @xmath41 myr , about twice @xmath42 defined by formula ( 7 ) ) .",
    "in the case with @xmath43 the collisional timespan is around @xmath44 myr , however the fast inward evolution due to the large eccentricity , achieved by the dust grains because of the ism perturbations , significantly limits the lifetime of the particle within the disk .",
    "the most relevant sink mechanism in this scenario is related to the fast inward migration of grains driven by both the pr drag and the ism drag components of the force .",
    "the density plots are derived by computing the number of particles populating the local spatial area ( equal size squared bins ) at the end of the numerical simulation .",
    "this number is then normalized to the total number of particles which is kept constant and equal to @xmath45 in all our simulations .",
    "the first plot on the top left in fig.[f1 ] shows how the debris disk appears when the ism force is neglected .",
    "it is axis ",
    "symmetric with a density peak at the internal ring corresponding to the location of the parent bodies .",
    "this is where all the pericenters of the particles reside and the higher density is due both to the geometrical configuration ( the orbit is tangent to the circle ) and to the creation of new grains when the older ones are destroyed .",
    "a second peak in the density plot appears at the outer ring where the apocenters of the particles are located and the grains move at the lowest speed .",
    "the pericenter longitudes are randomly distributed in between 0 and @xmath46 when the steady state is reached .",
    "the initial eccentricities of our sample of particles are encompassed between 0.420.45 while the initial semimajor axes range from 90 to 120 au .",
    "this orbital distribution is due to the value of @xmath20 adopted at the beginning of the simulation that reduces the mass of the central star injecting the grains into eccentric orbits .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     -2.1 truecm + -1.0 truecm -2.1 truecm + -1.0 truecm -2.1 truecm    significantly different is the situation when @xmath18 is as low as @xmath47 ( fig.[f5 ] bottom plot ) : particles in the disk have time to move along the stark cycle .",
    "this is not interrupted by collisions since the collisional lifetime is longer than @xmath42 and the particles can build up large orbital eccentricities and inclinations . in this scenario ,",
    "the only mechanism able to halt the stark cycling is the fast inward drift due to the large eccentricity .",
    "the particles migrate inside driven by the pr and ism drag forces ending either onto the star or sublimating or impacting onto a planet .",
    "this sink mechanism is more effective for smaller values of @xmath48 since the maximum eccentricity @xmath49 that can be achieved by the particles decreases for increasing @xmath48 , according to the stark general problem . in fig.[f6 ] we show the evolution of the eccentricity and inclination for increasing values of @xmath48 .",
    "their values are strongly correlated , as predicted by the theory of @xcite ( the theoretical curves are plotted as continuous lines in the figures ) .",
    "two interesting features come out from fig.[f6 ] .",
    "first of all the drag forces tend to reduce the eccentricity detaching the numerical data from the theoretical curve even if the difference is not very marked .",
    "in addition , when the maximum eccentricity is lower , for higher @xmath48 , the particles move farther within the stark cycle because their drift time is longer .",
    "when @xmath50 the particles complete a full cycle and some start a new one , even if they do not complete more than two cycles before drifting inside 20 au .",
    "additional features related to the dynamics of the dust particles under the action of the ism flow and pr drag can be seen in the density plots shown in fig.[f7 ] . in the parent body plane",
    "the density distribution appears very asymmetric . in the case where @xmath51 ( fig.[f7 ] top plots )",
    "it is still possible to recognize the two elliptical structures produced by the evolution in the @xmath52 plane but their shape is blurred due to the inclination distribution .",
    "however , when @xmath53 the double  elliptical structure has fully disappeared and the inclination distribution determines the density distribution also in the parent body plane . as it can be argued from fig.[f6 ] middle plots , the orbital inclination is concentrated around @xmath54 and , in addition , when the inclination is higher , the node longitude is clustered around @xmath55 .",
    "this leads to an eccentric disk structure that is inclined respect to the original orbital plane of the parent body of approximately @xmath56 . finally , the case @xmath50 ( fig.[f6 ] bottom plots ) is the most symmetric case .",
    "the circular overdense shape of the disk close to the star is where the inclined orbits cross the parent body plane .",
    "the dust particles have a statistical uniform distribution of the nodes for any value of inclination and , as a consequence , a high density region is formed in correspondence to the intersection between the inclined orbits and the initial parent body plane .",
    "-3 truecm + -2 truecm -3 truecm + -2 truecm -3 truecm +    for larger dust grains ( 10@xmath2 m ) and low optical depth ( @xmath57 ) , the dynamical scenario is slightly different .",
    "the stark period is of the order of 23 myr , 10 times longer than that of 1@xmath2 m particles , but the drift rate has not decreased by the same amount . as a consequence ,",
    "the grains evolve less into the stark cycle and migrate inside before reaching large values of inclination .",
    "this is shown in fig.[f8 ] where the eccentricity and inclination of the dust , when the disk is in a steady state , are illustrated .",
    "the initial eccentricity is close to 0 since @xmath20 is small and this leads to a different stark cycle compared to that in fig.[f6 ] middle plots .",
    "the particles slowly evolve towards larger inclination values but they plunge into the inner regions of the disk and are lost before they can develop significant inclinations .",
    "the disk is then expected to be less perturbed compared to the case for 1 @xmath2 m size particles .",
    "this is confirmed by fig.[f9 ] where the spatial density distribution is illustrated and can be compared to that shown in fig.[f7 ] ( middle plot ) for 1 @xmath2 m size particles .",
    "-3 truecm +    -3 truecm +",
    "we have shown in this paper , by numerical modeling the evolution of debris disks under the effects of solar radiation pressure , pr drag and ism flux , that for typical values of optical depth @xmath26 the signatures of the ism wind on grains with radius in the range @xmath58 @xmath2 m , just above the cut - off size imposed by radiation pressure , are almost negligible . the amount of perturbations due to the interaction of dust particles with the local ism neutral atom flow are strongly reduced when the grain lifetime is short as in disks with large values of @xmath18 . in this scenario , the presence of asymmetries must be ascribed to different mechanisms like the presence of massive bodies within the disk .",
    "the neutral ism fails in producing either warping or clumping in such disks .",
    "different is the scenario when the optical depth is small .",
    "we have shown that for @xmath27 significant asymmetries appear on the density profile of the disk both in the parent bodies plane and out  of  plane .",
    "interesting is a double  elliptical pattern that develops in the parent bodies plane when the ism flow is almost coplanar to it .",
    "the disk structures are caused by the dynamical evolution of the orbital elements of the dust grains .",
    "the way in which these orbital parameters evolve can be in part predicted on the basis of the general stark model that helps in understanding the periodic nature of eccentricity , inclination and the dynamically related angles perihelion argument and nodal longitude @xcite .",
    "in addition , the semimajor axis has a fast inward drift due to the combination of pr drag and interaction with the ism .",
    "the two drag forces , in particular that related to the ism flow , are strong because of the large ecceentricity of the grains . the particles quickly migrate towards the star where they can either sublimate or be destroyed by collisions with planets or the star itself .",
    "this is an additional powerful sink mechanism for debris disks with small optical depth . on the contrary , if the disk has a large optical depth , collisional disruption acts on a much shorter timescale and it prevents a significant inward migration .",
    "the disk shape in this case would be mostly due to the initial value of @xmath20 which sets the initial orbital element distribution of the grains .",
    "the debris disk would then extend outwards respect to the parent body ring in spite of the strong ism and radiation drag force .",
    "this additional different dynamical behaviour of the dust grains , which again depends on the optical depth , sets a nice correlation between the value of @xmath18 and location of the disk respect to the parent body ring .",
    "disks with low values of @xmath18 would expand inward respect to the parent body ring down to the sublimation region or where planets are orbiting , while disks with large values of @xmath18 would extend mostly outwards .",
    "our study suggests that observational data of debris disks need care to be interpreted .",
    "potential asymmetries identified in the density distribution may be ascribed to interactions with the local flux of ism neutral atoms surrounding its parent star only if the disk has a low optical depth . otherwise , alternative explanations , like the presence of planets , must be investigated .",
