    "success of @xmath0 factory experiments at kek and slac indicates that @xmath0 physics is important to explore origins of the flavor mixing and the cp violation in the quark sector .",
    "the cp asymmetry in the @xmath5 mode is precisely determined , and a cp violation parameter , @xmath6 ( or @xmath7 ) is found to be consistent with the prediction in the standard model ( sm ) @xcite . in addition , branching ratios and cp asymmetries in various rare @xmath0 decays have been reported . in future",
    ", we expect much improvement in measurements of cp violation and rare @xmath0 decays at @xmath8 @xmath0 factories as well as hadron @xmath0 experiments @xcite",
    ".    goals of future @xmath0 physics are not only to very precisely determine the parameters of the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements @xcite , but also to search for new sources of cp violation and flavor mixings .",
    "for instance , scalar quark ( squark ) mass matrices could be such new sources in supersymmetric models .",
    "since the flavor structure of the squark mass matrices depends on the mechanism of supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking at a higher energy scale and interactions above the weak scale through the renormalization , future @xmath0 physics can provide quite important information on the origin of susy breaking .    in our previous papers @xcite",
    ", we studied the flavor signals in three different models namely , the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) , the su(5 ) susy gut with right - handed neutrinos , and the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with u(2 ) flavor symmetry @xcite .",
    "these models are typical solutions of the susy flavor problem .",
    "they have different flavor structures in the squark mass matrices at the electroweak scale .",
    "thus , they may be distinguished by low energy quark flavor signals .",
    "we calculated susy contributions to the @xmath9@xmath10 , @xmath3@xmath4 , and @xmath11@xmath12 mixings in these models , and showed that the consistency test of the unitarity triangle from angle and length measurements are useful to discriminate these models .",
    "in addition to the consistency test of the unitarity triangle , there are several promising ways to search for new physics effects through @xmath0 decay processes .",
    "as pointed out in the context of susy models @xcite , comparison of time - dependent cp asymmetries in @xmath5 , @xmath2 , and @xmath13 provides us with information on new cp phases in the @xmath14 transition , because these asymmetries are expected to be the same in the sm .",
    "recent results on the cp asymmetry in @xmath2 by belle and babar collaborations indicate a 2.7@xmath15 deviation from the sm prediction @xcite . this anomaly may be attributed to new physics , susy with @xmath16 parity @xcite , susy without @xmath16 parity @xcite , or other models @xcite .",
    "moreover , the cp asymmetries in the @xmath1 process @xcite have been extensively studied in several models , and they would exhibit substantial deviation from the sm in some models @xcite . the branching ratio and decay distributions of @xmath17 have also examined by several authors in different contexts of new physics , and they may probe different aspects of new physics @xcite .    in this paper , we extend our previous analysis @xcite to rare @xmath0 decay processes , especially @xmath14 transitions .",
    "we investigate the direct cp asymmetry in @xmath1 , and the mixing induced cp violation in @xmath18 process , where @xmath19 is a cp eigenstate hadron with strangeness , and cp asymmetry in @xmath2 process .",
    "we show that the above three models exhibit different patterns of deviation from the sm .",
    "these observables as well as those studied in our previous paper @xcite could play an important role in new physics search at future @xmath0 experiments such as a super @xmath0 factory @xcite and hadron @xmath0 experiments @xcite .",
    "the strategy of the present work and @xcite is different from most of other works . for each model of susy , we calculate susy effects in various mixings ( @xmath9@xmath10 , @xmath3@xmath4 , and @xmath11@xmath12 ) and rare decay processes , and identify possible patterns of deviations from the sm predictions .",
    "we then compare patterns of the new physics signals for different models . in this way",
    "we may be able to distinguish different models of susy breaking scenarios , or at least obtain important clues to identity the susy breaking sector .",
    "most of past works deal with a specific observable signal in a particular susy model .",
    "the strategy of combining various information in @xmath0 physics will be important in future , especially in the days of a super @xmath0 factory and dedicated hadron @xmath0 experiments .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to demonstrate how such global analysis in @xmath0 physics is useful to explore the flavor structure of susy breaking sectors .    in the present work , some of our calculations are re - analysis of past works under most up - dated phenomenological constraints , and others are new studies . even in the case that a similar calculation can be found in the literature for a specific process and a model , we repeat the calculation in order to treat various processes in a uniform way . in the msugra model , @xmath9@xmath10 , @xmath3@xmath4 , and @xmath11@xmath12 mixing , and the direct cp violation of @xmath1 were studied previously .",
    "although the mixing - induced cp violation in @xmath18 process and cp asymmetry in @xmath2 process have not explicitly considered before , it was recognized that such processes did not induce interesting signals once the severe constraints from various electric dipole moments were applied .",
    "we have confirmed this by explicit calculations . for the su(5 ) susy gut with right - handed neutrinos , we have found that flavor signals are quite different for different choices of the heavy right - handed neutrino mass matrix .",
    "the `` degenerate case '' defined in the next section was considered in @xcite . in particular , susy effects on the mixing amplitudes were studied in @xcite , and the mixing - induced cp violation in @xmath18 process was also considered in @xcite . the direct cp violation in @xmath1 and the cp asymmetry in @xmath2 process are analyzed here for the first time .",
    "the analysis of @xmath0 physics signals in `` non - degenerate case '' is new .",
    "we compare the implications of consistency test of the unitarity triangle for degenerate and non - degenerate cases , which has been done only for degenerate case in @xcite .",
    "we also present analysis of rare decay processes and the @xmath3 mixing for non - degenerate case , which partly overlaps with a recent work in @xcite . for the u(2 )",
    "model , flavor signals has been considered previously for mixing amplitudes in @xcite , but a quantitative analysis of various rare decay modes has not yet appeared in the literature .",
    "preliminary results of our analysis are presented in a workshop report @xcite , but the non - degenerate case is not included in ref .  @xcite .",
    "although we tried to clarify a characteristic feature of each model , this can not be complete because of large numbers of free parameters",
    ". there might be some parameter space where new contributions become particularly important , which are not shared in a generic parameter space .",
    "for example , it was pointed out recently that neutral higgs boson exchange effects may contribute to the various flavor changing process , especially for a large value of the ratio of the two vacuum expectation values ( @xmath20 ) @xcite , but we do not take into account these effects .",
    "although we estimate that such an effect is small for the parameter region presented numerically in this paper , this effect will be potentially important .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the three models .",
    "the @xmath9@xmath10 mixing , the @xmath3@xmath4 mixing , cp asymmetries in @xmath1 and @xmath2 are discussed in sec .",
    "the numerical results on these observables are presented in sec .",
    "our conclusion is given in sec .",
    "in this section , we give a brief review of the models .",
    "they are well - motivated examples of susy models , and are chosen as representatives that have distinct flavor structures .",
    "a detailed description of these models can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .      in the msugra",
    ", susy is spontaneously broken in the hidden sector and our mssm sector is only connected to the hidden sector by the gravitation .",
    "the soft breaking terms are induced through the gravitational interaction , and the soft breaking terms have no new flavor mixing at the scale where they are induced .",
    "the soft breaking terms are specified at the gut scale by the universal scalar mass ( @xmath21 ) , the universal gaugino mass ( @xmath22 ) , and the universal trilinear coupling ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the soft breaking terms at the electroweak scale are determined by solving renormalization group equations .    in this model ,",
    "the only source of flavor mixings is the ckm matrix .",
    "new flavor mixings at the electroweak scale come from the ckm matrix through radiative corrections .    as for cp violation , in addition to the cp phase in the ckm matrix , we have two new cp phases .",
    "one is the complex phase of the @xmath24 term ( @xmath25 ) , and another is the phase of @xmath23 ( @xmath26 ) . since the potential sensitivity of the neutron electric dipole moment ( edm ) to cp violations in low energy susy models",
    "was stressed by ellis _",
    "_ in ref .",
    "@xcite , the neutron edm and the electron edm have been studied in detail by several authors in different context of low energy susy @xcite .",
    "the bottom line in the msugra is that @xmath25 and @xmath26 contribute to the neutron and the electron edm s , and experimental constraints @xcite on these phases are very severe . taking these edm constraints into account ,",
    "effects of new cp phases on @xmath27 and @xmath0 physics have turned out to be small @xcite .      in the last decade , three gauge coupling constants were determined precisely at lep and other experiments , and the measured values turned out to be consistent with the prediction of supersymmetric grand unification .",
    "furthermore , recent developments of neutrino experiments established the existence of small finite masses of neutrinos @xcite , which can be naturally accommodated by the seesaw model @xcite . guided by these observations , we consider su(5 ) susy gut with right - handed neutrinos .    in this model , the soft breaking terms are the same as in the msugra model at the scale where the soft breaking terms are induced . unlike the msugra model , the su(5 ) susy gut with right - handed neutrinos",
    "has new sources of flavor mixing in the neutrino sector .",
    "a large flavor mixing in the neutrino sector can affect the right - handed down type squark sector through gut interactions .",
    "quark flavor signals in this model have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the seesaw model ,",
    "the neutrino mass matrix is written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the neutrino yukawa coupling constant matrix , @xmath30 is the mass matrix of right - handed neutrinos , @xmath31 denotes the vacuum expectation value of one of the higgs fields @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are generation indices . in the basis that the charged lepton yukawa coupling constant matrix is diagonal , this neutrino mass matrix is related to the observable neutrino mass eigenvalues and the maki - nakagawa - sakata ( mns ) matrix @xcite as @xmath34    in this model , the scalar lepton ( slepton ) masses and the @xmath35 terms have the msugra type structure at the planck scale ( @xmath36 ) as @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the mass squared matrices of sleptons and @xmath40 denotes the slepton trilinear scalar couplings .",
    "however , at the scale @xmath41 , where the right - handed majorana neutrinos are decoupled , new flavor mixings are generated by the renormalization group effects @xcite . in the leading logarithmic approximation",
    ", they are given as    @xmath42    for @xmath43 .",
    "consequences of these mixings on lepton flavor violating processes have been investigated from various aspects @xcite .",
    "we see that , in this model , lepton flavor violating processes such as @xmath44 are sensitive to the off - diagonal elements of @xmath45 .",
    "we consider two cases in the su(5 ) susy gut with right - handed neutrinos in regard to the spectrum of the right - handed majorana neutrinos .",
    "one is the case that all the masses of heavy majorana neutrinos are the same ( degenerate case ) . in this simplest case ,",
    "the flavor mixing of the neutrino sector is only caused by @xmath29 because there is no flavor mixing in @xmath30 .",
    "since the large mixing in the mns matrix implies that the off - diagonal elements of @xmath29 is large , the @xmath44 branching ratio is enhanced in the wide region of the parameter space and exceeds the experimental bound in some parameter regions . in order to suppress the @xmath44 branching ratio , we consider an elaborated case that @xmath30 is not proportional to the unit matrix ( non - degenerate case ) . in this case",
    ", the neutrino mixing comes from both @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "if the large mixing in the mns matrix originates from @xmath30 , the corresponding off - diagonal element of @xmath29 need not be large .",
    "thus , the @xmath46 decay rate can be suppressed in this case .",

    "cp phases in the neutrino sector .",
    "there are six physical complex phases in @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the basis in which the charged lepton mass matrix is real and diagonal . from the combination of these six cp phases , we obtain three cp phases in the low energy region , _",

    "gut cp phases @xcite .",
    "the quark and lepton superfields are embedded in @xmath47 and @xmath48 representations of su(5 ) as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the ckm matrix at the gut scale , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 are quark and lepton superfields in the @xmath56th generation with the @xmath57 gauge quantum numbers in parentheses .",

    "on the other hand , the non - degenerate case of the su(5 ) susy gut exhibits quite attractive flavor signals in @xmath183 and @xmath184 as seen in table  [ table_obs_model ] .",
    "we have also observed that the u(2 ) model predicts significant deviations from the sm in the @xmath186 rare decays as well as the unitarity triangle analysis .",
    "so far , both belle and babar experiments have collected copious @xmath0 decays , and they are expected to go well continuously .",
    "thus , more @xmath2 and related events will be obtained in near future . moreover ,",
    "both kek and slac plan to upgrade their @xmath0 factories .",
    "therefore , the above flavor signals may well be in the reach of the present and foreseeable future @xmath0 experiments .    combining the above observation with the results in our previous work ,",
    "we conclude that the study of the unitarity triangle and rare @xmath0 decays could discriminate several susy models that have different flavor structures in their susy breaking sectors .",
    "such a study will play important roles , even if susy particles are found at future experiments at the energy frontier such as lhc .",
    "although the spectrum of susy particles will be determined at lhc and a future @xmath8 linear collider , most of information concerning the flavor mixing of the squark sector is expected to come from the super @xmath0 factory and hadron @xmath0 experiments .",
    "since the flavor structure of the susy breaking provides us with an important clue to the origin of the susy breaking mechanism and interactions at very high energy scales , @xmath0 physics will be essential for clarifying a whole picture of the susy model .",
