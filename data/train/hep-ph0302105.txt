    "euclidean - time hadronic current correlation functions contain information about the hadronic spectrum , including information about the temperature dependence of hadronic masses , the widths of these states and the eventual disappearance of such status from the spectrum at sufficiently high temperature .",
    "we have been interested in recent calculations of spectral functions of hadronic current correlators [ 1 - 3 ] .",
    "these calculations make use of lattice results for the euclidean - time correlation functions , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , of pseudoscalar and vector currents . for example , for the pseudoscalar correlator , one considers the equation g_p ( , t)=_0^d _ p ( , t ) k ( , , t),with k ( , , t)=,and attempts to obtain values of the spectral function @xmath8 by using the maximum - entropy - method ( mem ) [ 4 , 5 ] .",
    "( a similar procedure is used to obtain @xmath9 . )",
    "the mem method is used , since the inversion of eq.(1.1 ) to obtain @xmath8 is an `` ill - conditioned problem''[2 ] , given the limitations of the lattice data .",
    "the necessity of using such advanced numerical procedures is discussed in ref.[2 ] . as stated there",
    ", one has to introduce assumptions as to the characteristics of the desired solutions when using the mem analysis . at this point , the physical significance of the results for the spectral functions obtained with the mem procedure is uncertain in the case of resonant structures with energies of several gev found using that method .",
    "recently we have made some calculations of hadronic current correlators and their associated spectral functions [ 6 ] .",
    "once we calculate the spectral functions using the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model , we may obtain @xmath0 and @xmath1 by using eqs . ( 1.1 ) and ( 1.2 ) .",
    "we may then compare our results for these euclidean - time correlators with those calculated using the data obtained in the lattice simulations of qcd .",
    "since we have described our method of calculation of the spectral functions in an earlier work [ 6 ] , we here relegate that material to the appendix for ease of reference . a novel feature of our work is use of temperature - dependent coupling parameters for the njl model .",
    "we have made use of such parameters in earlier studies of meson properties at finite temperature and have described the mesonic confinement - deconfinement transition [ 7 ] . while the use of temperature - dependent coupling constants for the njl model is novel , we may note that the qcd coupling constant @xmath10 has been made temperature - dependent in a study of the quark -gluon plasma equation of state in ref . [ 8 ] and [ 9 ] .",
    "( see fig.1 of ref.[9 ] . )",

    "that choice gives rise to restoration of chiral symmetry at @xmath110 in the njl model with @xmath96 .",
    "if we maintain the value @xmath96 , but use a constant value for @xmath111 , with @xmath90 , we find restoration of chiral symmetry at @xmath112 .    the calculations reported in fig . 13 and 14 may also be made using our gaussian cutoff , @xmath113 , with @xmath114 .",

    "we believe it is of interest to see that we obtain reasonable values for the euclidean correlators . of more importance , however , is our observation that we find some evidence for the temperature dependence of the njl coupling parameters that we have used in other works . by analogy",
    ", we expect that the coupling parameters should also be density - dependent , and we have introduced such density dependence in earlier work [ 13 ] .",
    "density dependence of the coupling parameters may be particularly important , given the strong interest in diquark condensates and color superconductivity at high baryon density [ 14 ] .",

    "the result given in eq.(a18 ) is only expected to be useful for small @xmath170 , since the gaussian regulator strongly modifies the large @xmath170 behavior .",

    "the denominator is capable of describing resonant enhancement of the correlation function .",

    "<S> we also discuss some additional evidence for the utility of temperature - dependent coupling parameters for the njl model . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if the constituent quark mass at @xmath2 is @xmath3 in the chiral limit , the transition temperature is @xmath4 for the njl model with a standard momentum cutoff parameter . </S>",

    "<S> the introduction of a weak temperature dependence for the coupling constant will move the value of @xmath7 into the range 150 - 170 mev , which is more in accord with what is found in lattice simulations of qcd with dynamical quarks . </S>"
