    "we may witness the assembly of rich clusters by observing large groups or poor clusters which , in turn , would be the future core of rich clusters .",
    "the details of this process will depend in part on how these large groups / poor clusters relate to more nearby structures .",
    "most galaxies in the universe are concentrated in low - density environments ( groups and poor clusters ) . for intermediate redshifts , @xmath110.5 , while massive clusters of galaxies have been widely studied , the intermediate - mass systems , those between loose groups and rich clusters of galaxies , have received comparatively little attention , either in x - rays or in the optical . in the context of the hierarchical structure formation scenario ,",
    "an intermediate - mass system is a fundamental player to understand the process involved in the assembly of massive clusters of galaxies .",
    "x - rays observations of intermediate - mass structures are particularly interesting , since the cluster x - ray faint - end luminosity function has eventually to turn over if the luminosity function of clusters is to meet that of single brightest elliptical galaxies with x - ray luminosities of a few @xmath12 ergs  s@xmath5 .",
    "if this gap at intermediate luminosities could be closed , an x - ray luminosity function of all galactic systems could eventually be established , in analogy to that existing for the optical @xcite . in addition",
    ", the spatial distribution of low - mass clusters at intermediate - redshifts could be studied in order to map regions just entering the non - linear regime , i.e. , @xmath13 .    in the optical ,",
    "the intermediate - mass systems are also of great importance and have received little attention .",
    "many previous works have focused on the study of the galaxy population at intermediate redshifts but mostly in rich cluster of galaxies .",
    "these have established that the morphological content of galaxy clusters at intermediate redshift differs dramatically from that in nearby clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , at @xmath110.5 there is an excess of spirals and a deficiency of lenticular galaxies in cluster cores when compared with the galaxy population in nearby clusters .",
    "it has been shown by these studies that the morphology - density relation is strong for concentrated , `` regular '' clusters , but nearly absent for clusters that are less concentrated and irregular , in contrast to the situation for low - redshift clusters , where a strong relation has been found for both .",
    "@xcite suggests that these observations indicate that the morphological segregation proceeds hierarchically along the time , i.e. irregular clusters at intermediate redshifts are not old enough to present segregation .",
    "however , nearby irregular clusters seem to be evolved enough to establish the correlation .",
    "taken together , these studies reveal that the morphological segregation has evolved significantly since @xmath14 , at least for regular clusters .",
    "however , it is not yet known at which degree , if any , morphological segregation evolves in the sparser environments of groups .",

    "we have used sextractor @xcite to detect objects in the images and to obtain their relevant photometric parameters .",

    "we adopted the magnitude given by the parameter mag@xmath31auto as the value for the total magnitude of the objects .",

    "the sextractor `` stellarity '' index ( an indication of how certain an optical source is unresolved ) was used to separate stars from galaxies .",

    "the presence of several sub - structures in the x - ray , weak - lensing mass and galaxy density maps , the existence of a bridge of matter in the center of the cluster connecting different sub - structures ( detected in weak - lensing only ) and the complex velocity distribution of member galaxies reveal that this cluster is dynamical active .",

    "<S> we present a multiwavelength study of the poor cluster rx j1117.4@xmath00743 ( [ vmf  98 ]  097 ) at z@xmath10.485 , based on gmos / gemini south @xmath2 , @xmath3  photometry and spectroscopy , and xmm - newton observations . </S>",
    "<S> we examine its nature and surroundings by analyzing the projected galaxy distribution , the galaxy velocity distribution , the weak - lensing mass reconstruction , and the x - ray spectroscopy and imaging . </S>",
    "<S> the cluster shows a complex morphology . </S>",
    "<S> it is composed by at least two structures along the line - of - sight , with velocity dispersions of 592@xmath4 km s@xmath5 and 391@xmath6 km s@xmath5 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> other structures are also detected in x - ray , in the galaxy projected number density map , and by weak - lensing . </S>",
    "<S> one of these clumps , located east from the cluster center , could be gravitationally bound and associated to the main cluster </S>",
    "<S> . the derived temperature and bolometric x - ray luminosity reveal that [ vmf  98 ]  097 behave like a normal cluster , in agreement with @xmath7 correlation found for both local ( @xmath8 ) and moderate redshift ( @xmath9 ) clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the mass determination inferred from weak - lensing is in average 3 to 4.8 times higher ( depending on the model assumed ) than the x - ray mass . </S>",
    "<S> we have two possible explanations for this discrepancy : _ </S>",
    "<S> i ) _ the cluster is in non - equilibrium , then the deviation of the x - ray estimated mass from the true value can be as high as a factor of two ; _ ii ) _ the intervening mass along the line - of - sight of the cluster is producing an over - estimation of the weak - lensing mass . </S>",
    "<S> based on the analysis presented , we conclude that [ vmf 98 ]  097 is a perturbed cluster with at least two substructures in velocity space and with other nearby structures at projected distances of about 1 h@xmath10mpc . </S>",
    "<S> this cluster is an example of a poor cluster caught in the process of accreting sub - structures to become a rich cluster . </S>"
