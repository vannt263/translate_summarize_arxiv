    "wind energy is one of such sources and wind turbines are being subject to intensive studies for improving their efficiency@xcite .",
    "although the basic laws of atmospheric wind motion have been known for a long time , important problems such as turbulence , layering , and the statistics of extreme events remain poorly understood . a better understanding of these phenomena can help to construct energy conversion schemes that are both more efficient and robust . here , robustness must be considered under two aspects : first , the occurrence of sudden changes in wind speed and direction can interrupt the process of energy conversion , meaning unreliability and a sudden slump in the electrical energy generated , which is seen as one of the major obstacles for the replacement of fossil and nuclear plants by wind energy sources .",

    "second , to uncover specific features of the wind turbine and characterize the different working regions observed in the power - speed plane .",
    "after this , we test our approach to uncover the functional dependence of the well - known performance curve , which describes the functional dependence of the power production and the wind speed . whereas previous reports have pointed out the benefits of deriving the power curve from the drift field@xcite , we additionally take the diffusion field into account and find that this procedure creates additional insight .",
    "we use the data sets generated by the markov chain model described by lopes et al .",
    "using such synthetic data sets that properly reproduce the statistical features of empirical data sets , allows us to use data sets as large as needed for our analysis .",
    "moreover , the markov chain model serves as a filter to remove periodicities present in the data .",
    "this is an essential step for our modeling , as it would not be possible to correctly estimate the kramers - moyal coefficients from the raw data .",
    "we start in sec .",

    "[ sec : performance ] we apply it to analyze the performance curve of a wind turbine . in sec .",
    "[ sec : integration ] we show that the same method when applied separately to both wind speed and power production allows to derive the performance curve .",
    "further , the same analysis also provides insight concerning specific features of the turbine system studied .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] concludes this paper .",
    "the data analyzed in this manuscript was simulated from a set of measurements from a wind turbine in the region of pinhal interior , portugal .",
    "the measured properties are the power production @xmath0 of the wind turbine , the wind speed @xmath5 and the wind direction @xmath1 ( @xmath6 corresponds to north ) .",
    "the wind turbine was selected out of a total of 57 wind turbines in an eolic park .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows an overview of the eolic park .",
    "the time increment between two successive measures is @xmath7 minutes and the time period covered starts in january 1st 2009 and ends in december 31st 2010 , yielding approx .",
    "@xmath8 data points .",
    "it has to be remarked that these measurements are acquired directly from the top of wind turbine ( nacelle ) and might not be optimal for the reconstruction of the underlying physical processes for two reasons : first , the wind speed measurement is acquired at a point located downstream of the turbine blades and can neither account for the spatial extension and inhomogeneity of the wind field nor for its complex aerodynamical interaction with the turbine blades@xcite .",
    "secondly , the 10 minute sampling period of the historical data set does not allow to resolve the time scales of either the turbulent interaction between wind and turbine , nor the quick action of the controller system response .",
    "finally , missing data records , a low number of data points @xcite or large sampling intervals @xcite , and periodicities due to the daily and seasonal variations in wind flow often hinders a direct stochastic analysis of these data sets . specifically , it is well known that the estimation of the drift and diffusion coefficients which we use can not be applied to periodic time series .",
    "if applicable , a filtering or detrending procedure has to be applied to the data set @xcite .",
    "however , as the quasi - daily variations in the wind speed do not occur every day , the usefulness of a filtering or detrending procedure has to be doubted .",
    "thus , the challenge is to devise new methods that can make most use of the information present on these data sets  given that most of the data acquisition systems on existent wind farms are limited  with the aim of understanding the dynamic processes of the wind power generation , which hopefully can lead to economic benefits from scheduling and maintaining a level of constant production .",
    "to overcome some of these problems , we employ a reconstruction of the original wind data set through a markov chain model , which has recently been established @xcite using a joint discretization of the wind speed , power and direction variables for the state definition . in our specific case within the range of each variable @xmath0 , @xmath5 and @xmath1 we select @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 states .",
    "states without a realization in the time series are deleted , all states that contain at least one observation are kept .",
    "details about the estimation of the transition probabilities can be found in @xcite and appendix  [ append : markovmodel ] .",
    "the use of the mc model has the additional benefit of removing periodicities from the data .",
    "based on the markov chain transition matrix @xmath12 with @xmath13 being the probability of transition from state @xmath14 to state @xmath15 , the synthetic data sets were generated using the following monte carlo approach .",
    "we find the cumulative probability transition matrix @xmath16 with @xmath17 and select randomly an initial state @xmath18 .",
    "a random number @xmath19 between zero and one is then uniformly selected and a new state @xmath20 is chosen such that @xmath21 for details see ref .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the generated time series . as shown in the previous work ref .",
    "@xcite , the proposed markov chain model reproduces the dominant statistical features of all three properties , namely power production , wind speed and wind direction , although no periodicities are present in the reproduced time series .",
    "the resulting synthetic data series for power production and wind speed also retain the persistence statistics , namely the average duration of power production and wind speed on a certain level , respectively .",
    "power production and wind speed are presented as fractions of the maximum observed power @xmath22 and wind speed @xmath23 respectively , assuming therefore values between zero and one .",
    "the wind direction in the original time series follows a bimodal pattern , which is to some extent also periodic : during the day there are weaker breezes in a particular direction than during the night when wind streams in a different direction ; therefore the prevailing wind speed values occurring during the `` day '' ( 2 pm  2 am ) have approximately @xmath24 , a value different from the one found for wind speeds measured during the `` night '' ( 2am2pm ) , @xmath25 .",
    "the markov chain model is capable of preserving this bimodality . although we will not consider the wind direction in our study",
    ", one should notice that the wind direction bimodality is reflected in the distribution of the wind speed ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] below ) .",
    "another bimodality preserved from the original data set is the one in the joint pdf of velocity and power , which is visible in fig .",
    "[ fig4]f .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the discretization of the data set where the combined states for power and speed are indicated with boxes and circles represent the historical data set points projected into the speed - power plane .",
    "the synthetic data sets were generated with @xmath26 data points and show stationary behavior , i.e.  have constant moving averages ( not shown ) .",
    "this approach has several advantages over the direct analysis of historical data sets .",
    "first , high - quality data series of arbitrary length can be generated , which increases the accuracy of the markov analysis .",
    "secondly , the generated data are by construction markovian , with the reconstruction through the markov chain acting as a filter that removes both noise correlations and periodicities .",
    "finally , non - gaussian transition probabilities between the states are preserved , which enables to study them through higher kramers - moyal ( km ) coefficients .",

    "the co - evolution of two or more stochastic variables , such as wind speed and power production , can be described through a system of coupled stochastic equations , each one defined by a deterministic contribution ( drift ) and stochastic fluctuations from possible stochastic sources . in this section",

    "indeed , the drift and diffusion functions of the underlying process are defined through conditional moments , namely @xcite :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 are the first and second conditional moments ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "these conditional moments can be directly derived from the measured data as @xcite @xmath48 and @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the @xmath51-dimensional vector of measured variables and @xmath52 symbolizes a conditional averaging over the entire measurement period , where only measurements with @xmath53 are taken into account .",
    "important conditions to hold are ( i ) the underlying process is stationary and ( ii ) the markovian property is fulfilled .",
    "numerically @xmath54 and @xmath55 are determined on a @xmath56 mesh of points in phase space , as a function of the variables @xmath57 , using the drift and diffusion functions .",
    "locally , at each mesh point , one can always diagonalize the matrix @xmath58 and compute their @xmath27 eigenvalues and @xmath27 eigenvectors . as shown previously@xcite",
    ", this analysis provides information about the stochastic forces acting on the system .",
    "namely , the eigenvalues indicate the amplitude of the stochastic force and the corresponding eigenvector indicates the direction toward which such force acts . in a previous work@xcite",
    "we argued that to each eigenvector of the diffusion matrix one can associate one independent source of stochastic forcing @xmath59 and thus the eigenvectors can be regarded as defining principal axes for stochastic dynamics .",
    "in particular , if one eigenvalue is very small compared to all the others , the corresponding stochastic force can be neglected . in the following sections we present a different implication of this principal stochastic component analysis , which emphasizes that the vanishing of one stochastic direction is in fact an indication of a strong functional dependence between the pair of variables being analyzed .",
    "in this section we focus solely on two variables , which are power production @xmath0 and wind speed @xmath5 .",
    "since both series are stationary and markovian , we assume them to evolve according to the following equations :    @xmath60    [ power - velocity ]    in general , the six functions defining vector @xmath61 and matrix @xmath62 depend on both variables and describe the coupling between each other . based on eqs .",
    "( [ kms ] ) , we can derive both @xmath61 and @xmath62 from the functions @xmath63 and @xmath64 , which , in turn , are extracted directly from the synthetic data - set by computing the corresponding conditional moments using eq .",
    "( [ defcoefkm ] ) .",
    "note that , solving eq .",
    "( [ d2 ] ) for computing the matrix @xmath62 yields multiple solutions .",
    "if @xmath62 is a solution then all matrices of the form @xmath65 where @xmath66 is an orthogonal matrix ( @xmath67 ) are also admissible solutions .    the matrix @xmath62 can therefore be computed as the `` square root '' of matrix @xmath64 , i.e.  by diagonalizing @xmath64 through a proper permutation matrix and since all eigenvalues are positive ( @xmath64 is positive definite)taking the square root of each eigenvalue and transforming the matrix back .    figures [ fig4]a - e show the five components of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , i.e. the numeric results for both the drift and the diffusion coefficients computed directly from the generated @xmath0 and @xmath5 time series .",
    "the large fluctuations in the region near to maximum power production and wind speed are due to lack of observations . indeed , the joint pdf for @xmath0 and @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]f ) shows that this region is poorly sampled .",
    "to extract valuable information , next we treat these functions separately .",
    "namely , we consider the drift vector field @xmath68 and the eigenvectors of the diffusion matrix associated to its eigenvalues @xmath69 and @xmath70 . figure  [ fig5 ] shows the drift vector field in the power production and wind speed state space , restricted to the sampled region defined by the power production curve in fig .",
    "the solid black line is the performance curve computed from the ( p , v ) joint probability density function , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]f , and defines the most likely power production for a given wind speed .",
    "three different regions can be identified .",
    "region i in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] is characterized by a large wind speed , i.e.  above a `` threshold '' velocity @xmath71 that exceeds the rated wind speed of the turbine . postponing a more detailed description to section [ sec : integration ] , we define @xmath72 , which corresponds to a 97-percentile of the wind speed distribution .",
    "for these rare events of high wind speeds , the expected behavior of the wind turbine is to maintain the power production since there is a surplus of energy in the airflow . in this region , the performance curve is roughly constant at @xmath73 . still , positive power drifts are observed whenever the power production is below the performance curve .",
    "the wind speed drift is large in magnitude and always negative , i.e. the drift points towards lower wind velocities .",
    "region ii is characterized by production levels above a transition region of @xmath74 , indicated by gray shading in figs .",
    "[ fig5],[fig6 ] , which is defined in more detail in section [ sec : integration ] and fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . a closer look at region ii enables one to identify a fixed point region ( @xmath75 ) at high power production levels and wind speed @xmath76 , shown as an encircled area in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] near the @xmath71 .",
    "this speed value coincides approximately with the rated wind speed , i.e.  the speed for which the turbine was designed and at which it operates at an optimal regime .",
    "it can therefore be concluded from our analysis that the turbine has been well selected , and it remains to be seen if similar conclusions can be drawn when applying our method to arrays of turbines .",
    "finally , region iii is characterized by frequent low - speed events with a power production below @xmath77 , containing another attraction point at @xmath78 .    in previous works@xcite",
    "the drift vector field around the performance curve is parallel to the power production axis . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the vector field tends to be tilted towards the performance curve , because the data analyzed was sampled with a much smaller frequency , and therefore the time between successive measures is sufficiently large to observe the convergence to the stable fixed points .",
    "such observations can be more clearly understood by considering fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] together with the marginal pdf of the wind speed shown in its inset .",
    "the distribution of observed values for the wind speed follows approximately a weibull distribution , as is known from the literature@xcite . in our case we observe significant deviations at the tail , which shows a bump .",
    "this deviation can be explained with the help of fig .",
    "[ fig2]c and by recalling that there are correlations between the wind speed with each one of the main wind directions ( as highlighted in section  [ sec : data ] ) , resulting in the bimodality of the wind speed .",
    "the bump in the distribution for the wind speed indicates one of the two modes , namely the one observed at high wind speeds .",
    "therefore , the bimodality of the original data is preserved as bimodality of the markov chain model .",
    "the two dominant trends identified in region i are compatible with the expected behavior of the power production control system present on the wind turbine . for high values of wind speed , the controller action upon the blade aerodynamics is capable of sustaining the production level despite the expected decrease of the wind speed .",
    "one has to consider , however , the time scales involved . with a 10min resolution of the original data ,",
    "it is not possible to directly observe the rapid controller action on the blades , only the average behavior of the controller as well as actions that occur on larger time scales , such as the rotation of the tower .",
    "however , even at large sampling times , the data set catches some events outside of the power curve and the subsequent conditional moments mirror the controller action that forces the system back on the curve .    another important application of our method deals with the diffusion matrix .",
    "as explained in the previous section , by diagonalizing the diffusion matrix at each point of the phase space one is able to determine the two eigendirections for diffusion .",
    "being orthogonal to each other , these two eigendirections define an ellipse with major and minor axis proportional to the corresponding eigenvalue .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows the diffusion ellipses in phase space .",
    "region i is characterized by the largest ellipses indicating very large fluctuations , while there is an area in region ii , which presents small fluctuations and corresponds to the fixed point areas identified in the drift field . in the high - slope region of the power curve ,",
    "the ellipses degenerate , i.e.  one eigenvalue is negligible when compared to the other ( @xmath79 ) .",

    "as we mention above , the procedure described in this section has been performed on synthetic data generated using a markov chain model .",
    "one might argue that the drift and diffusion coefficients could be extracted directly from the measured data .",
    "however , as a process in time , the real data also reflects daily and seasonal variations , which hinders and eventually spoils this approach . it has been found ( cf .",
    "[ sec : performance ] ) that the dynamics of the system are reflected by the presence of two maxima in the joint distribution ( one at low @xmath5 , near @xmath90 and one at high @xmath5 , near @xmath91 ) .",
    "the two dimensional pdf of the measured data ( not shown ) closely resembles the one of synthetic data , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]f , including the two maxima . estimating drift and diffusion coefficients directly from the measured data , however ,",
    "does not allow to reproduce this distribution ( not shown ) .",

    "[ append : errors ] ) , _ iii ) _ it faithfully reproduces the joint pdf , and _",
    "iv ) _ the analysis using the mc yields the correct physical dynamics and fixed points ( cf .",
    "[ sec : performance ] ) , it is reasonable to take the simulated data as the aperiodic process corresponding to the time series of power and wind speed .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows that along the performance curve one eigenvalue is typically much larger than the other .",
    "this is an indication that in fact @xmath0 is a function of @xmath5 , which in the case of power production and wind speed yields the performance curve drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] .    to see this",
    "one first takes @xmath0 and @xmath5 as two general variables fulfilling eqs .",
    "( [ power - velocity ] ) and observes that if @xmath92 there are not two independent stochastic forces , but only one , yielding for @xmath5@xcite and for @xmath0    @xmath93    [ lang ]    where functions @xmath94 and @xmath95 are of course different from the drift and diffusion functions defined above in eqs .",
    "( [ power - velocity ] ) , since only one variable is taken into consideration for the stochastic motion equation .",
    "consequently , the separate analysis of both wind speed and power production enables one to extract valuable insight about the full dynamics and behavior of the wind turbine with the atmospheric wind .",
    "in fact , the 2d analysis of the performance curve summarized in figs .",

    "( [ velocitylang],[powerlang ] ) .",
    "the drift of the wind speed @xmath83 has three zeros .",
    "these zeros correspond to three fixed points , two stable ( @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) , and one unstable at @xmath98 .",

    "the deviations can be attributed to the fact that eqs .",

    "these coefficients , describing the respective deterministic and stochastic interactions of wind field , turbine aerodynamics , and controller action , are estimated from a synthetic time series generated using a markov chain model of the original measurement data .",
    "we argue that this reconstruction is superior to a direct evaluation of the measurements .    as a main finding",
    ", we present the fact that the reconstruction of the power curve using both drift and diffusion coefficients uncovers additional information not visible in an analysis of the drift field alone@xcite , even though we are using measured data of a very low measurement rate as model input .",
    "specifically , our analysis reveals the existence of various distinct regions in the wind speed  power production plane .",
    "in addition , we have been able to reconstruct the power curve from the drift and diffusion coefficients , using a method which should be able to uncover functional relationships between stochastic variables in a wide range of experimental setups .",

    "[ fig7 ] allows to detect the region which belongs to its basin of attraction , within which drift drives the trajectories to the upper stable fixed point , whereas out from this regions trajectories are pushed to the lower stable fixed point .",
    "finally , information about how trajectories diffuse in phase space , i.e. the entire dynamics of the system , can only be obtained completely after extracting the drift and diffusion fields together with the fixed points of the drift field and the principal directions of diffusion . only after analyzing the separation of diffusion eigenvalues visible in fig .",

    "although there are limitations in increasing the extracted power of a wind turbine , typically described by the power coefficient which has a maximum value given by the betz limit@xcite , our approach may be helpful in obtaining a better understanding of the complex dynamics that determines power production in wind turbines .",
    "indeed , we believe that such a stochastic description if applied to an entire wind park , would enable to better quantify the risk associated to the estimate of global energy production . the global energy production of a wind park",
    "is usually determined by financial constraints , i.e.  by decision making of how much energy one must buy or sell in the market to compensate the energy production fluctuations .",

    "the markov chain transition probabilities were not obtained employing the usual maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimator , but by using a modified likelihood function which combines information from 1-step and 2-step transitions , as described in this appendix .",
    "this modified ml yields lower variance estimates for the transition probabilities ( see appendix [ append : errors ] ) .",
    "let @xmath122 ,  @xmath123 be the state space of the markov chain model , where each state is a combination of a wind power- , speed- , and direction - state .",
    "thus the wind - power , -speed and -direction time - series can be transferred into a stream @xmath124 of states , i.e.  @xmath125 , where @xmath126 denotes the length of the time - series and @xmath127 denotes the state the markov process assumes at time @xmath128 with @xmath129 , @xmath130 .",
    "let @xmath131 denote the probability of the process for moving from state @xmath14 , at time @xmath128 , to state @xmath15 , at time @xmath132 .",
    "then the likelihood function @xmath133 , i.e.  the probability of the observed series of states @xmath134 , given the transition probabilities @xmath131 for 1-step transitions , is @xmath135 since the probability of the process being in state @xmath136 is constant , the maximum likelihood estimator can thus be written as the maximum of @xmath137 subjected to @xmath138 and @xmath139 , with @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the set of all 1-step transitions @xmath142 observed in the state stream @xmath134 .",
    "solving the above optimization problem is equivalent to minimizing the negative log - likelihood function @xmath143 , subjected to the same constraints . for practical purposes",
    "we consider henceforth the log - likelihood function @xmath144 .",
    "next , we consider only 2-step transitions .",
    "taking @xmath145 as the probability of the process for moving from state @xmath14 , at time @xmath128 , to state @xmath15 , at time @xmath146 , the maximum likelihood estimators are given by the maximum of @xmath147 with @xmath148 , where @xmath149 ( odd time points ) and @xmath150 ( even time points ) , assuming without loss of generality that @xmath151 is even .",
    "here , we use the chapman - kolmogorov equations to express the 2-step transitions @xmath145 in terms of 1-step transitions @xmath131 with the same constraints as above .    the corresponding log - likelihood function , whose minimization defines an equivalent optimization problem , is @xmath152 .    finally , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , we minimize the objective function given by the sum of the two log - likelihood functions above , namely @xmath153 and under the same constraints .",
    "higher order markov models were also tested and not showed considerable improvement compared to the estimator @xmath154 in eq .",
    "( [ lfinal ] ) .",
    "notice that the minimization of @xmath154 in eq .",
    "( [ lfinal ] ) for the series of states @xmath134 is equivalent as to minimize the 1-step functional @xmath144 of the augmented state stream @xmath155 @xmath156 , where @xmath157 stands for voids in the state stream .",
    "concerning the state space partition , we tried several different partitions of the power - speed - direction - space .",
    "comparison of the histograms of the original data and the data synthesized using these models showed that the model with the highest resolution of the binning in the power - speed plane is @xmath158 , which reproduces the original data most accurately .",
    "a lower bound for the uncertainty of the transition probabilities is provided by the cramer - rao bound ( crb ) , since there is no simple expression to determine the parameters variance for the 2-step estimator , described in section [ append : markovmodel ] .",
    "the crb for maximum likelihood estimators with constraints on the parameter space can be computed by using the following equation @xcite : @xmath159 where @xmath160 is an orthonormal matrix spanning the null - space of the jacobian @xmath161 of the parameters equality constraints and @xmath162 the hessian of the objective function , defined in section [ append : markovmodel ] .",
    "the uncertainty is linked to the number of observed transitions in the data .",
    "results show that a high value for the crb ( @xmath163 ) is always associated with infrequent transitions ( @xmath164 observations , in the 2-yr dataset ) . for transition probabilities",
    "@xmath165 with more than 25 observations , 90% of the @xmath166 values are smaller than @xmath167 .    to assess the performance of the 2-step estimator , its crb is compared with the crb of the 1-step estimator , applied to the same 2-yr dataset .",
    "results shows that for the transition probabilities with a high crb value , the 2-step estimator provides a lower bound . in the remaining cases ,",
    "the difference is not significant .",
    "another source of errors stems from our use of the direct estimation of the kramers - moyal ( km ) coefficients from the synthetic time series .",
    "this method has been found to introduce three principal types of errors @xcite .    the first error accounts for the statistical variation of counts @xmath51 in each bin used for the calculation of the conditional moments .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that this error decreases with @xmath168 . since we can generate synthetic time series of arbitrary length and , therefore , arbitrarily high @xmath51 in each bin under consideration",
    ", we can neglect this error .",
    "second , estimation of the km coefficients uses an expansion of the fokker - planck operator in powers of the temporal increment @xmath169 , neglecting higher orders in @xmath169 .",
    "it is known @xcite that this finite - time expansion induces an erroneous count @xmath170 of the @xmath171th conditional moment @xmath172 , namely @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "we have calculated these errors numerically , using the estimated km coefficients @xmath175 and their numerical first and second derivatives @xmath176 , and found them to be generally within a few percent of the estimated km coefficients .",
    "a third source of errors is the finite size of the bins used for the calculation of the conditional moments .",
    "again , it can be shown @xcite that this finiteness induces an erroneous count of the moments ( and corresponding coefficients )    @xmath177    where @xmath178 and @xmath179 are the respective bin centers and bin widths , and @xmath180 is the stationary distribution of the stochastic variable .",
    "we numerically investigated this error using fits for both the stationary distribuitions and km coefficients inside the bins , and found it to be generally in the few - percent regime , too , increasing considerably only at the edges of the regions investigated , where the km functions become steeper .",
    "the effect of those two last error sources is indicated by error bars in fig .",
    "in general , whenever the diffusion matrix @xmath119 has rank one , the set of variables @xmath181 have in fact only one independent stochastic source , and therefore eqs .",
    "( [ power - velocity ] ) reduce to eqs  ( [ lang ] ) , where the stochastic force @xmath182 is the same for both variables .",
    "since both variables , @xmath0 and @xmath5 , are driven by the same stochastic forces , one can take only one of them as the stochastic variable , say @xmath5 , and the other one as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath30 alone , @xmath185 . in that way one",
    "incorporates all stochastic contributions into @xmath5 .",
    "the first partial derivative shows that the variation of the production power by speed variations equals the quotient of the corresponding diffusion amplitudes in time .",
    "the second partial derivative describes the local power production which is given by the power production drift @xmath190 , after subtracting the contribution of the wind speed drift @xmath83 in the variation of @xmath0 due to @xmath5 .",
