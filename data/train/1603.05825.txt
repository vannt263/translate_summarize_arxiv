    "we understand a complex system as a system with a large number of interacting components whose aggregated behaviour is non - linear and undetermined from the behaviour of the individual components @xcite .",
    "if we now consider these components as nodes of a network , and the underlying physical interaction between any two nodes as links , one way to understand these complex systems is by studying its topological structure , namely , the network connectivity . in natural complex systems ,",
    "the connectivity of the components is often unknown or is difficult to detect by physical methods due to large system - sizes .",
    "hence , it is of interest to infer the network structure that represents the physical interaction between time - series collected from the dynamics of the nodes .",
    "although network inference in non - linear systems has been extensively studied in recent years using cross - correlation or mutual information @xcite , recurrences @xcite , functional dynamics @xcite , and granger causality @xcite , to name a few , it still presents open challenges .",
    "the fundamental reason is that non - linearities , even in the absence of noise , produce behaviour that hinders the correct identification of existing or non - existing underlying direct physical dependence between any pair of nodes .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce an information - based methodology to infer the structure of complex systems from time - series data .",
    "our methodology is based on a normalized form of an estimated mutual information rate ( mir ) , the rate by which information is exchanged per unit of time between any two components .",
    "mir is an appropriate measure to quantify the exchange of information in systems with correlation @xcite . in particular , authors in ref .",
    "@xcite show how to calculate mir in the case a markov partition is attainable , which is generally extremely difficult to find or unknown . here",
    ", we first show how mir can be approximately calculated for time - series data of finite length and low - resolution .",
    "then , we propose a normalization of the estimated mir that allows for a successful inference about the dependence structure of small networks of interacting dynamical systems , when markov partitions are unknown .",
    "our findings show that the estimated normalized mir allows for a successful inference of the structure of small networks even in the presence of additive noise , parameter heterogeneities and different coupling strenghts .",
    "moreover , our normalized estimated mir outperforms the use of mutual information ( mi ) based inference when different time - scale dynamics are present in the networks .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "information can be produced in a system and it can be transferred between its different components @xcite . if transferred , at least two components that are physically interacting by direct or indirect links should be involved . in general , these components can be time - series , modes , or related functions of them , defined on subspaces or projections of the state space of the system . in this work ,",
    "we study the amount of information transferred per unit of time , i.e. , the mutual information rate ( mir ) , between any two components of a system , to determine if a link between them exists .",

    "the reason is that different systems can have different correlation decay times , @xcite hence , different characteristic time - scales .",
    "there are three main approaches to compute mi , and the variation resides in the different ways to compute the probabilities involved in eq .  .",

    "we also discard the mir values for the same variable , i.e. , mir@xmath115 , because we are interested in the exchange of information between different variables .",
    "we compute the @xmath108 exchanged between any two nodes in a network by taking the expected value over different partition sizes @xmath116 , i.e. , @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the expected value of @xmath0 . in order to remove the systematic error @xcite in this calculation ,",
    "we perform instead a weighted average , where the finer partitions ( larger @xmath11 ) contribute more to the @xmath108 value than the coarser ones ( smaller @xmath11 ) .",
    "the reason is that a smaller @xmath11 is likely to create a partition that is further away from a markovian one than a partition of larger @xmath11 .",
    "consequently , we resolve the systematic error by weighing differently the different partitions .",
    "therefore , we propose a novel normalization for the mir as follows .",
    "first , we use an equally - sized grid of size @xmath11 , we subtract from mir@xmath119 , calculated for all pairs of nodes , its minimum value and denote the new quantity as @xmath120 .",
    "theoretically , a pair that is disconnected should have a mir value close to zero , however , in practice , the situation is different because of the systematic errors coming from the use of a non - markovian partition , as well as , from the information flow passing through all the nodes in the network .",
    "for example , the effects of a perturbation in one single node will arrive to any other node in a finite amount of time .",
    "this subtraction is proposed to reduce these two undesired overestimations of mir .",
    "after this step , we remain with mir as a function of @xmath11 . normalizing then by @xmath121 , where again the maximum and minimum are taken over all different pairs , we construct a relative magnitude @xmath122 , namely , @xmath123 where @xmath113 is the mir between nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 and @xmath124 is the minimum with respect to the @xmath114 pairs and @xmath125 is the maximum with respect to all @xmath114 pairs .",
    "this magnitude is still a function of @xmath11 , however , we can now perform an average over different values of @xmath11 without the systematic error .",
    "next , we apply eq .   for different grids",
    "sizes @xmath126 to obtain @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the maximum number of cells per axis , resulting in a grid of @xmath129 cells , and fulfilling at the same time eq .  .",
    "then , similarly to the idea used for eq .  , we make a second normalization over @xmath130 to obtain @xmath131 where the maximum is being taken now over the @xmath128 grids .    finally , applying eq .   to each pair",
    "@xmath132 , we obtain its average value , @xmath133 . the higher the value of @xmath133 , the higher the amount of information exchanged between @xmath0 and @xmath1 per unit of time .",
    "this allows us to identify pairs of nodes that exchange larger rates of information than others .    in order to perform the network inference from the mir , we fix a threshold in @xmath134 $ ] and",

    "[ sec : section_models ] , this system has two clusters of nodes with different dynamics .",
    "the dynamics in the left cluster is given by the 3rd - order composition of the logistic map , whereas the dynamics of the right cluster is given by ordinary logistic map dynamics .",

    "we conclude that the normalized mir is preferable over the normalized mi when it comes to the detection of links in a complex system with different correlation decay times .",

    "we find that @xmath133 is a robust measure to perform network inference in the presence of additive noise , short time - series , and also for systems with different coupling strengths .",
    "since mir and @xmath133 depend on the correlation decay time @xmath32 , they are suitable for inferring the correct topology of networks with different time - scales .    in particular , we have explored the effectiveness of mir versus mi in terms of how successful they are in inferring exactly the network of our small complex systems . in general , we find that mir outperforms mi when different time - scales are present in the system . our results also show that both measures are sufficiently robust and reliable to infer the networks analyzed whenever a single time - scale is present . in other words , small variations in the dynamical parameters , time - series length , noise intensity , or topology structure , maintain a successful inference for both methods .",
    "it remains to be seen the types of errors that are found in these measures when perfect inference is missing or impossible to be done .",
