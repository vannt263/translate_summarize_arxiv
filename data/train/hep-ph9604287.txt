    "the recent observation of the _ top _ quark , with a mass around @xmath5 gev @xcite , allows a more complete analysis of the yukawa sector of the standard model .",
    "in particular , it allows an evaluation of the running to higher energy scales of the parameters in that sector .",
    "the perturbative unification of the gauge couplings obtained in minimal supersymmetric ( susy ) scenarios suggests that the ( nonsinglet ) matter and gauge contents do not change up to energies around @xmath6 gev . if that is the case , the first step to understand the flavor structure of the standard model is to evolve it up to those energies .",
    "we present in the first part of this article an updated and complete analysis of the evolution from low energies to the unification scale @xmath7 of the 10 physical parameters in the quark mass matrices ( 6 masses , 3 mixing angles , and the complex ckm phase ) in the minimal susy extension of the standard model ( mssm ) @xcite .",
    "we will study in detail the behaviour of the mixing angles when the _ top _ and/or _ bottom _",
    "yukawa couplings @xmath8 are large at @xmath7 . in this regime @xcite the renormalization - group corrections _ focus _ any initial value of the coupling at @xmath7 to a narrow interval @xmath9 ( around @xmath10 ) at low energy : @xmath11 .",
    "we will analyze how this nonlinear evolution of the couplings ( quasifixed point ( qfp ) behaviour ) affects the mixings with the third generation ; in particular , we will find the low - energy value of the mixing @xmath12 ( with @xmath13 ) that corresponds to @xmath14 at @xmath7 .",
    "on the other hand , the observed pattern of fermion masses and mixings does not look accidental , and suggests a symmetry in the yukawa matrices as the origin of the hierarchies .",
    "obviously , such a flavor symmetry should be formulated at the unification scale .",
    "although the yukawa matrices contain more free parameters than physical observables , it is not easy to find simple structures that are able to accommodate without need of fine tuning the measured values of masses and mixings . as a matter of fact , the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite classify the symmetric quark mass matrices with a maximal number of texture zeroes , and find that only five textures are acceptable experimentally .",
    "these matrices predict correlations between mass parameters that can be expressed in a simple ( approximate ) form ; we will analyze how the correlations run from @xmath7 to low energies .",
    "we will also analyze a particular scenario @xcite derived from the heterotic string which has been recently proposed as the only realistic possibility among the models within its class . in this scenario ( and also in the model proposed in @xcite , with one more texture zero than the cases in @xcite )",
    "the renormalization - group corrections could be essential to obtain a predicted mixing @xmath2 within the experimental limits .",
    "the quark yukawa sector of the mssm can be expressed in terms of the superpotential @xmath15 with @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in that sector",
    "there are 10 independent physical parameters : once the yukawa matrices are diagonalized , only the eigenvalues ( 3 in the up and 3 in the down quark matrices ) and the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix ( with 3 mixing angles and a complex phase ) appear in the lagrangian .",
    "the procedure to obtain these parameters at @xmath7 from the pole masses and the low - energy mixings is the following .",
    "for the heavier quarks , the perturbative pole mass @xmath19 is related to the running mass @xmath20 in the @xmath21 scheme by a simple expression @xcite ( this change of scheme is numerically important due to the large size of @xmath22 ) .",
    "taking @xmath0 gev and @xmath23 gev we obtain @xmath24 the running masses of the lighter quarks are given at 1 gev @xcite : @xmath25 ; @xmath26 ; @xmath27 ; @xmath28 .",
    "the masses evolve up to the lightest higgs scale @xmath29 due to gauge interactions only ; this is a factor @xmath30 for the values at 1 gev and @xmath31 for @xmath32",
    ". it will be also convenient to run the _ top _ quark mass down to that scale ; we obtain @xmath33 .    at @xmath34",
    "we find the yukawa couplings to the lightest neutral higgs @xmath35 , which correspond to the yukawas in the standard model ( we assume @xmath36 gev ) @xmath37 being @xmath38 the ckm matrix at @xmath34 . from @xmath34 to @xmath39 these yukawas evolve due to the gauge and the ( much smaller ) yukawa interactions of the light fermions ; between @xmath39 and @xmath40 the _ top _ yukawa corrections are also important . from @xmath40",
    "up to @xmath41 gev we include the interactions of the susy particles and the extra higgs scalars ( the standard model and mssm renormalization group equations can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite respectively ) .",
    "the yukawa couplings to the two higgs doublets are ( at @xmath40 ) @xmath42 where @xmath1 is the ratio of vevs giving mass to _ down _ and _ up _ quarks . at @xmath7",
    "we diagonalize the yukawa matrices ( we express the eigenvalues as @xmath43 , with @xmath44 ) and find the ckm matrix .",
    "we will neglect corrections to mixing angles and light quark masses @xcite proportional to the _ soft _ susy breaking parameters , although these corrections can be significant in the large @xmath4 regime @xcite .",

    "we take all the masses and mixings at @xmath34 in their central value ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) , with @xmath0 gev and @xmath61 .",
    "( 10,8.5 ) ( -2.6,-7.5 )    from the analysis it follows that :    * the evolution of @xmath62 and @xmath63 coincide at the 0.04% ; the same happens for @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( 0.06% ) and @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( 0.05% ) * the running of the cabibbo mixing @xmath68 and of the ckm phase ( in @xmath2 ) are smaller than the 0.03% and 0.07% , respectively .",
    "the evolution of masses and mixings is insensitive to the value of the complex phase . *",
    "the approximation @xcite @xmath69 is excellent ( error smaller than 1% ) for @xmath70 .",
    "these expressions , with @xmath71 , are obtained assuming that the _ top _ yukawa coupling is dominant and constant between @xmath34 and @xmath7 .",
    ".experimental value at @xmath34 of quark mass ratios ( the central value ) and ckm mixings ( lower and upper limits ) .",
    "[ tab : datos : iniciales ] [ cols=\"^ , > , < \" , ]     to illustrate the size of the nonlinear effects ( first point above ) , we will consider the case when @xmath2 vanishes at @xmath7 .",
    "the running from @xmath7 to @xmath34 generates then a nonzero mixing . in fig .",
    "[ gr : v13 ] we plot @xmath72 for @xmath1 between 1.29 and 67.7 , with the fermion masses and the rest of mixings in their central value .",
    "we find a value much smaller than the experimentally preferred , although it grows when @xmath4 decreases ( _ i.e. _ , for a fixed @xmath73 , @xmath74 increases ) .",
    "we also show in table [ tab : fijo1 ] the low energy value of @xmath2 which corresponds in each case to a vanishing mixing at @xmath7 .",
    "note that @xmath2 , the smallest mixing in the ckm matrix ( @xmath12 in the maiani parametrization ) , is a physical parameter whose zero value at one loop is not protected by any symmetry . a flavor structure giving @xmath75 at @xmath7",
    "would be caracterized by @xmath76 .",
    "( 10,8.5 ) ( -2.6,-7.5 )",
    "we proceed now to study how the evolution from @xmath7 to @xmath34 affects the relations between quark mass parameters obtained in models with flavor symmetries at the unification scale .",
    "first we will consider the 5 symmetric patterns with a maximal number of texture zeroes found in ref .",
    "these patterns depend on 7 complex parameters which , after phase redefinitions , are reduced to 7 moduli and 2 phases ( 3 phases in solution 2 ) . the approximate analysis shows that it is possible to adjust the experimental masses and mixings without need of fine tuning .",
    "in particular , the absence of significant cancellations implies that the only role of the 2 complex phases in each pattern is to generate the ckm phase . as a consequence ,",
    "the 7 moduli fit the 6 quark masses and 3 mixings giving two relations .",
    "one relation @xcite is shared by all the cases ( solutions 1  5 in @xcite ) : @xmath77 ( with complex corrections of modulus @xmath78 in solutions 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 ) .",
    "the second relation is @xmath79 for solutions 1 , 2 , 4 and @xmath80 for solutions 3 and 5 ( in the last case there are complex corrections of order @xmath81 ) .",
    "the masses and the rest of the mixings can be adjusted to their central values , with an arbitrary ckm phase .",
    "relations ( [ eq : rel1][eq : rel3 ] ) are stablished at @xmath7 , and one has to evolve the experimental quantities up to that scale in order to decide if they are acceptable .",
    "the running of the first two relations , however , is just a 0.2% ( smaller than corrections to the approximate diagonalization of the matrices ) .",
    "taking the masses in their central values we have @xmath82 and @xmath83 , which compares well with the data ( @xmath84 and @xmath85 @xcite ) .",
    "the relation @xmath86 suffers sizeable renormalization - group corrections . at @xmath34",
    "we have @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the running from @xmath34 to @xmath7 can be expressed in terms of the ratio @xmath89 that we plot in fig .",
    "[ gr : relacion : r ] for different values of @xmath1 .",
    "note that for @xmath90 , @xmath91 diminishes less than @xmath92 ( _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath93 ) , while for larger values of @xmath94 we observe the opposite behaviour .",
    "if the masses and mixings were known with more accuracy , this fact could be used to _",
    "correct _ the prediction @xmath95 in the preferred direction .",
    "( 10,8.5 ) ( -2.6,-7.5 )    the different running of the mixings and the ratios of quark masses involving the third family would also affect the symmetric texture with one more zero proposed in @xcite .",
    "those matrices predict @xmath96 , a value that seems too large : the values of the masses at @xmath34 suggest @xmath97 , while the experimental upper bound is 0.048 .",
    "since the evolution of @xmath2 ( @xmath62 ) and @xmath67 ( @xmath63 ) coincide , the running from @xmath7 will be simply expressed by the same factor @xmath98 in fig .",
    "[ gr : relacion : r ] : @xmath99 and the relation would be experimentally acceptable for @xmath100 ( with @xmath0 gev ) .",
    "we will finally analyze a pattern of quark matrices derived from the heterotic string .",
    "the matrices have been proposed @xcite as the only realistic possibility in a class of models compactified in the tian - yau manifold .",
    "their structure is @xmath101 by a redefinition of the quark fields we can put these matrices in a more convenient form : @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are complex and the rest of the parameters are real and positive . as we will see , these 8 moduli and 2 phases can fit all the masses and the larger mixings to their central value and predict acceptable ( but _ large _ ) values for @xmath2 and a nonzero ( but _ small _ ) complex ckm phase .",
    "the approximate diagonalization gives @xmath105 @xmath106 and a ckm matrix ( in the maiani parametrization ) with @xmath107 in terms of physical quantities we have @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are independent complex phases ( the dominant phase @xmath109 is related to the phase of @xmath104 ) . at @xmath34 , for masses and mixings in their central values , the relation reads @xmath111 then it seems that the small value of @xmath2 requires a cancellation between the first two terms , with a best value @xmath112 ( for @xmath113 ) .",
    "renormalization - group corrections affect this relation due to the different running of @xmath67 and @xmath114 , with the total effect captured again by the factor @xmath98 plotted in fig .",
    "[ gr : relacion : r ] @xmath115 for low values of @xmath98 , the lower bound for the predicted value of @xmath66 decreases .",
    "for example , for @xmath116 we have @xmath117 and a ckm phase @xmath118 , whereas @xmath119 would imply @xmath120 ( for all the quark masses and the rest of mixings in their central values ) .",
    "note that for smaller values of @xmath67 , this bounds are relaxed .",
    "the observed value of @xmath39 implies that @xmath121 is the dominant term in the renormalization - group equations at large scales . as a consequence ,",
    "the corrections to the quark masses lose universality and there appear nontrivial corrections to the ckm mixings of the light quarks with the third family .",
    "in addition , the low - energy value of @xmath121 could be related to a qfp of the equations : any _ large _ value of @xmath74 seems to converge to a narrow interval around 1.2 at @xmath34 . in the mssm with @xmath0 gev",
    "this forces a low value of @xmath4 , whereas an analogous situation occurs for @xmath122 in the large @xmath4 regime . for @xmath39 around 200 gev and large @xmath4",
    ", both low - energy yukawa couplings would result from any large value of the couplings at @xmath7 ( a large value of @xmath4 could be also motivated by the possibility to relax the @xmath123 anomaly @xcite ) . in this framework , we perform an updated ( with the new data for @xmath39 ) and complete ( all values of @xmath4 ) analysis of the evolution from @xmath34 and @xmath7 of all the physical observables in the quark yukawa sector of the mssm . we study in detail the behaviour of the smallest ckm mixing @xmath2 in the _ top _ and/or _ bottom _ qfp regions , and we show that the evolution is linear : @xmath124 . to illustrate the size the nonlinear corrections we analyze the value of @xmath72 which corresponds to @xmath3 ; we obtain @xmath125 ( this value increases going to non - perturbative values of @xmath121 at @xmath7 , i.e. , lowering @xmath4 ) .",
    "then we analize the renormalization - group corrections to fermion mass relations which appear in models with flavor symmetries at @xmath7 . in particular",
    ", we discuss the relations obtained for symmetric mass matrices with a maximal number of zeroes and in a superstring - motivated model .",
    "we show that in some relations the corrections can be numerically important ( they are essential in some of the cases ) and that they depend quite strongly on @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , for the relations analyzed the corrections can be expressed in terms of the ratio @xmath98 in ( [ ec : r ] ) .",
    "we find remarkable that , for a fixed @xmath39 , @xmath98 goes to zero decreasing @xmath4 and grows ( @xmath126 ) for @xmath4 large @xmath127 .",
    "if the masses and mixings were measured with more accuracy , this fact could be used to conveniently _ correct _ the relations by varying @xmath4 , whereas if the higgs sector of the mssm were observed and @xmath4 fixed , it could be used to exclude some of the quark mass matrix models .",
