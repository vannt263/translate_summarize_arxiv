    "during more than quarter of a century both classical and quantum affine toda field theories and related generalized ( m)kdv ( ( modified ) korteweg - de vries ) hierarchies were extensively studied ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "these theories are integrable and have the l - a pair ( or zero curvature ) formulation .",
    "the most famous are sine - gordon and @xmath0 models ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) and the associated kdv and reduced boussinesq hierarchies .",
    "these theories allow the supersymmetric and fermionic generalizations @xcite-@xcite both called `` super '' because their underlying algebraic structures are affine lie superalgebras .",
    "+ the super - toda field theory appears to be supersymmetric if and only if the associated superalgebra possesses the purely fermionic system of simple roots .",
    "one should note , however , that usually the superalgebras allow a few simple root systems @xcite , they correspond to different toda theories and only purely fermionic system corresponds to the supersymmetric one .",
    "+ the supersymmetric version of the drinfeld - sokolov reduction applied to the matrix l - operator of the toda - mkdv theories gives the generators of the related super w - algebra with the commutation relations provided by the associated hamiltonian structure ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "+ in this paper we consider these theories from a point of view of quantum inverse scattering method ( qism ) ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "there are two approaches of applying qism to toda - mkdv type models .",
    "the first one is more traditional and based on the quantization of the corresponding lattice systems ( see e.g. @xcite,@xcite ) and the second one is based on the quantization in terms of continuous free field theory and was introduced in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "+ here we use the second approach , generalizing our results obtained in @xcite-@xcite for the affine superalgebras of rank 2 to the case of general affine superalgebra .",
    "+ we build the quantum generalization of the monodromy matrix and prove that the related auxiliary @xmath1-operators ( which are equal to the monodromy matrix multiplied by the exponential of the elements from the cartan subalgebra ) satisfy the rtt - relation @xcite , @xcite , while the quantum counterpart of the monodromy matrix itself is shown to satisfy the specialization of the reflection equation ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this provides the quantum integrability relation for the supertraces of the monodromy matrix taken in different representations ( transfer matrices ) .",
    "moreover , it is proven that the auxiliary @xmath1-operators are related with the universal r - matrix associated with the underlying quantum affine superalgebra , with the lower borel subalgebra represented by the vertex operators from the corresponding toda field theory . using this relation in the case",
    "when the simple root system is purely fermionic , it is demonstrated that the transfer matrix is invariant under the supersymmetry transformation as it was shown on particular classical examples of toda field theories @xcite , @xcite .",
    "+ in the last two sections the above constructions are illustrated by means of two important examples of integrable hierarchies : quantum super - kdv @xcite and susy n=1 kdv @xcite .",
    "these hierarchies generate two integrable structures of the superconformal field theory , the second one is invariant under the susy transformation while the first one is not .",
