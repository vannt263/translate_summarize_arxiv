    "the principal aim of statistical analysis of galaxy catalogs is to extract information about the initial fluctuations in the early universe , their subsequent gravitational growth , and processes of galaxy formation . to decipher the available data , the distribution of the underlying dark matter have to be inferred from the distribution of galaxies .",
    "the two distributions in principle can be assumed to be quite different , i.e. galaxies are biased tracers of the underlying dark matter statistics @xcite . in a class of phenomenological models ,",
    "galaxy fluctuations @xmath1 are assumed to be a function of the matter fluctuation field , @xmath2 , including the simplest case of linear bias @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "accurate knowledge of this function is needed to interpret galaxy statistics in light of theories of structure formation .",
    "the bias function can be extracted from measurements of large scale structure statistics and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "one possibility is to use second order statistics from several sources , especially cmb maps together with galaxy catalogs to constrain bias ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the underlying idea is that fluctuations in the cmb have a direct relationship with density fluctuations in the early universe . the comparison with present day galaxy statistics reveal information on both the gravitational amplification , and galaxy formation .",
    "the application of these methods is limited to fairly large scales , since non - linear growth and bias for galaxies , as well as secondary anisotropies for the cmb become more and more complex on smaller scales .",
    "another class of methods use higher order statistics @xcite or velocity information ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) from galaxy catalogs to derive the bias function internally .",
    "these methods again are limited to linear to weakly non - linear scales , where both gravitational instability and bias theory is on a well understood . since the most reliable large scale structure data are available on smaller scales , it is natural to seek methods for constraining bias , applicable on small , non - linear scales .",
    "the principal aim of this work is to introduce such technique based on a direct comparison of counts in cells in simulations and data .",
    "we generalize a simple and elegant idea by @xcite , based on the relation between the ( continuous ) cumulative probability distribution functions of the galaxy and matter density fluctuation fields , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "the above relation allows in principle the recovery of the bias function , if both cumulative distributions are known : @xmath8 \\ .\\ ] ] @xcite used an approximate form of this relation by simply replacing the cumulative probability distribution with the cumulative distribution of counts in cells @xmath9 , and postulating that the dark matter cumulative distribution is well described by a lognormal function .",
    "both of these approximations render the original form of this method fairly approximate .",
    "dark matter distribution does not exactly follow a lognormal distribution ( as we show later ) , and discreteness effects ( the difference between the continuous and discrete distribution ) are important but for the densest galaxy catalogs .",
    "we improve the original idea on both counts : we _ measure _ the cumulative distribution for both galaxies , and for dark matter ; the latter from simulations with the appropriate cosmology .",
    "in addition , we achieve accurate reconstruction of the _ continuous _ probability distribution function from the discrete counts in cells distribution .",
    "this eliminates most of the `` stochastic '' component of the bias arising from poisson noise , and improves the accuracy of the reconstruction .",
    "moreover , this means that we can penetrate smaller scales , where discreteness effects are important .    in what follows ,",
    "we show that our method can recover the bias in a robust fashion with unprecedented precision , even in the non - linear regime . in the next section we present our method to estimate the continuous cumulative distribution function from discrete counts in cells measurements , and thus recover the bias function . in section three",
    "we test our technique in a suit of @xmath10-body simulations in both real and redshift spaces .",
    "the final section contains conclusions and discussions of our results .",
    "the technical challenge of the idea outlined in the previous section consists of estimating the continuous probability distribution function from counts in cells measurements ( cic ) in a robust way .",
    "note that there are several proved and fast methods to estimate cic distributions from galaxy catalogs or in simulations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this work we are using the former method for all measurements .",
    "the count probability distribution function ( cpdf ) @xmath11 is the probability that a certain cell has @xmath10 objects ( galaxies ) .",
    "it is directly related to the continuous function under the locally poissonian approximation @xmath12^n",
    "e^{-\\langle n \\rangle ( 1+\\delta)}}{n ! } d\\delta \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the mean cic .",
    "some models of galaxy formations predict sub - poissonian scatter for very small halos ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . as long as a specific theoretical model , written in a convolution form similar to the above , is available , our technique can be easily adapted . for most scales",
    ", however , the local poissonian assumption appears to be correct , and we assume it for the rest of this work",
    ".    as long as eq ( 3 ) can be inverted , eq ( 2 ) can be used to calculate the bias .",
    "the inversion , however , is a fairly delicate process .",
    "most of the technical challenge of our aim was met by devising pair of new methods for deconvolving this somewhat unstable equation in a robust way .",
    "to invert eq ( 3 ) in a model independent way , we use the richardson - lucy ( rl ) method ( see appendix c in @xcite and reference there in ) .",
    "this iterative method is based on the bayes theorem .",
    "the kernel in eq.(3 ) is poissonian @xmath14^n e^{-\\langle n \\rangle   ( 1+\\delta)}}{n ! } \\ .\\ ] ] since @xmath10 is within @xmath15 $ ] in practice , the @xmath16 has to be normalized to unity with respect to @xmath10 . in the probabilistic spirit of this method ,",
    "the functions need rescaling : @xmath17 and @xmath18 . starting from an initial guess of @xmath19",
    ", we can calculate @xmath20 via eq.(3 ) . from this , a better approximation of @xmath21 is obtained , @xmath22 this in turn is used as the input for the next iteration .",
    "the improvement of the fit @xmath23 after the @xmath24 iteration is quantified by the cost function @xmath25 , where @xmath11 is the measured cic distribution .",
    "one caveat is the phenomenon of `` over - learning '' , when the recovered probability distribution starts to fit small fluctuations in the measured @xmath11 .",
    "this can inject artificial features into the results after ( too ) many iterations .",
    "numerical experiments indicate , that after about @xmath26 iteration the @xmath27 is becoming fairly small and changes little .",
    "the process is illustrated in figure 1 .",
    ", where a lognormal model for the pdf was used to generate a cpdf curve with noise generated at @xmath28 level .",
    "the inverted pdf on the figure is fairly accurate after 12 iteration , while the results of 100 iterations clearly show the sign of over - learning .",
    "displays @xmath29 as a function of iteration : indeed , beyond 10 - 12 iteration it is hardly changing ; this is the point of diminishing returns , after which over - learning kicks in .",
    "the displayed cost function is fairly typical , and we have found that an inspection of @xmath29 always allows a simple determination of a sensible stopping point .",
    "because of the slow change in the cost function , the inversion is only logarithmically sensitive to finding the optimal number of iterations , therefore this prescription is fairly robust .",
    "numerical experiments show ( see next section ) that this method converges fairly fast and arrives at a robust result if @xmath30 . for smaller average counts convergence slows down such that a few 100 iterations are needed , as well as poisson noise starts to dominate .",
    "we recommend that our method is used down to this value for robust results .",
    "another difficulty of the rl inversion is purely computational .",
    "typically @xmath31 for a cpdf of dark matter dataset from an n - body simulation , and the kernel is a broad function . for each pair of @xmath10 and @xmath11",
    ", we need to sample at least one point at the peak of the kernel @xmath32 , and a few hundred points on each side to keep the integration accurate .",
    "the last step thus costs about @xmath33 calculations of the kernel .",
    "storing the kernel would require an array of floats of dimension @xmath34 .",
    "this is unfeasible on a typical small workstation available to us .",
    "similar computational problems arise with other direct inversion methods , such as singular value decomposition , etc .",
    "this motivates us to define an alternative , model - dependent method , which i ) requires more modest computational resources , ii ) it can extend toward even smaller scales , i.e. sparser sampling of the distribution .",
    "an alternative which naturally lends itself is to use physically motivated parametrized pdf models .",
    "this idea was explored by @xcite , who adopted gaussian edgeworth expansions to the third order as model for @xmath35 to deconvolve eq.(3 ) and thereby fit for skewness and kurtosis . according to their investigations ,",
    "such method is severely limited to the weakly non - linear regime , where the gaussian edgeworth expansion is good approximation .",
    "this is especially important in our application , where not only the first few moments are interesting , but the full behavior of the pdf containing information on very high order moments .",
    "therefore we conclude that the gaussian edgeworth expansion is not a viable model for our purposes .",
    "a more promising empirical model can be built based on the lognormal distribution ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this model is physically motivated , arising naturally from perturbation theory of the logarithm of the dark matter density field @xcite .",
    "indeed , the skewed lognormal distribution ( sln3 ) appears to be an excellent approximation for the pdf of the dark matter field in a wide range of scales @xcite .",
    "it is plausible then , that sln3 might be a good approximation for galaxy distributions as well , as long as the bias is moderate ; the tests of the next section indeed confirm this idea .",
    "next we outline how one can proceed to invert equation ( 3 ) under the assumption of sln3 .    with the notation @xmath36 ( the density field ) , @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    ", the sln3 model reads as @xmath39 g(\\nu)d\\nu \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 , @xmath41 is an hermite polynomial of degree @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is a gaussian with zero mean and variance of unity .",
    "the quantities @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the renormalized skewness and kurtosis of the field @xmath46 , respectively @xcite : @xmath47    the convolution of @xmath48 with the poisson kernel , @xmath49 , corresponds to a model of observed @xmath11 depending on four parameters @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "these parameters can be fitted to the observed distribution , which in turn yields the best approximation of the real pdf by @xmath48 .",
    "the following poisson likelihood function was used to fit the parameters : @xmath52 where @xmath53 be the total number of cells used for the cic measurements .",
    "minimization of @xmath54 with respect to @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 corresponds to a third order sln fit , which is realized with the powell s method @xcite .",
    "note that we have experimented with other cost functions for fitting the parameters , including the conventional minimal @xmath55 and a likelihood function of @xcite , similar to the above , but @xmath56 replaced with @xmath57 .",
    "numerical experience suggests that the above cost function , which is close to @xmath55 for large @xmath58 , gives the best bias reconstruction among the variations tested .",
    "the above described bias reconstruction method , including both inversion methods at its core , was extensively tested in a suit of the dark matter mock galaxy catalogs extracted from n - body simulations by the gif project of the virgo consortium @xcite .",
    "we used the @xmath59 output for a lcdm universe with @xmath60 , @xmath61 , shape parameter , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , force soft length @xmath65kpc , the simulation box was of @xmath66mpc .",
    "the simulations have @xmath67 particles of mass @xmath68 .",
    "we used two mock galaxy catalogs , the gif galaxy catalog and the gif galaxy catalog for sdss .",
    "these artificial galaxy catalogs have been produced using semianalyical galaxy formation models @xcite .",
    "they have been studied extensively to explore biasing as function of luminosity , scale and redshift by @xcite .",
    "because of the computational difficulty of the rl inversion for the large dark matter simulations , we used the sln3 model fit exclusively for the inversion of the their pdfs .",
    "we found that above scales @xmath69mpc sln3 provides an excellent model for the dark matter distribution , while on smaller scales our model has more and more difficulty to fit the tail of the distribution ( see figure 3 ) . on scales of 2.21",
    "@xmath70mpc , the measured cpdf develops a very long tail even in log - space , which is not well fit by the polynomial correction of the sln3 beyond @xmath71 .",

    "the null - test consists of recovering @xmath74 from these catalogs ; our method passed with flying colors .",
    "as a typical example , fits to the measured cpdfs at 1% dilution level are presented on figure 4 .",
    "the fits are excellent approximation to the measurements . then the recovered @xmath75 is used to reconstruct the bias of our diluted subsamples with respect to the full sample . except for @xmath76mpc which has a @xmath77 peak difference , figure 5 .",

    "we aim to recover the bias function between a gif mock galaxy catalog and the underlying dark matter catalog .",
    "since we have both catalogs ( obviously not the case with real data ) , we can test our reconstruction against a density - density scatter plot based on a cell - by - cell comparison of the two catalogs .",
    "note that such direct comparison contains significant poisson scatter ( apparently the dominant contribution to stochastic bias ) .",

    "the plausible assumption about the application of our method in redshift space is that , in absence of significant velocity bias , the redshift space cpdfs will be modified similarly in the dark matter and galaxy catalogs .",
    "as long as this is correct , the bias function can be obtained by direct application of the method in redshift space . however , even if this assumption is only approximate , the dark matter distribution in redshift space is still recovered , which means that the effects of galaxy formation are decoupled from the evolution of dark matter ; this is the principal goal of bias recovery .",
    "the tests in this section show that redshift distortions have a small effect on our procedure , thus our recipe can be safely applied to redshift surveys without significant corrections .",
    "it has to be born in mind though , that this statement is somewhat model dependent ; we assume that the simulations and the semianalytic models used to create mock catalogs are close enough to reality that this statement will hold for real data .",
    "the cpdfs and their sln3 fits for the dark matter sample , the gif mock galaxy catalog and the mock galaxy catalog for sdss are shown in fig.12 , fig.13 and fig.14 respectively .",
    "the recovered bias functions of the gif mocks galaxy are displayed in fig.15 , while for the sdss mocks in fig.16 .",
    "the recovery of bias in redshift space is just as successful as in real space .",
    "we have also compared the recovered red shift space bias function to that of the real space .",
    "results based on rl inversion only are shown on figure 17 ( gif galaxy mock catalog ) and figure 18 ( mock galaxy catalog for sdss ) .",
    "the difference between the two curves is generally small , in fact for @xmath92 , the effect of redshift distortions on the bias function is negligible .",
    "the apparent difference between the gif curves on scale of @xmath93mpc is mostly due to the fact that the rl inversion is pushed to its limits at @xmath94 .",
    "we have presented a new method to extract the bias function from galaxy catalogs .",
    "since our method uses direct comparison statistics extracted from simulations and data , it is applicable to a large range of scales . in particular",
    ", its domain of validity includes the nonlinear regime , which has proved to be impenetrable to other previous methods .",
    "this is all the more important , since the most reliable data are still available on non - linear scales .",
    "in addition , most available data pushing to the largest scales have still significant non - linear `` contamination '' , to which our method is completely insensitive .",
    "in addition to expanding the range of applicability , our method has an accuracy which rivals all other methods .",
    "this is due to the fact , that it is using the full counts in cells distribution , which is sensitive to very high order statistics .",
    "the new technique is based on comparing the cumulative probability distribution functions in simulations and data .",
    "to turn this idea into a robust and reliable method , a difficult technical challenge had to be met : the reconstruction of the continuous probability distribution of density fluctuations from counts in cells measurements .",
    "this is a delicate , and potentially unstable inversion , for which we have proposed two solutions .",
    "one is a model independent inversion using a richardson - lucy iteration , while the other is model dependent fit based on the skewed lognormal approximation ( sln3 ) .",
    "the former method is useful down to scales where @xmath95 , and for relatively smaller number of particles due to computational constrains .",
    "the sln3 fitting is useful possibly to even slightly smaller scales , and it is feasible for large simulations of arbitrarily high particle number . therefore the former lends itself naturally for fitting the cpdf in galaxy catalogs , while the latter for large simulations .",
    "the range of reconstruction of the bias function is @xmath0 , and typically we could recover the bias from fairly realistic simulations at the @xmath28 level .",
    "this suggests that our appication of our method to contemporary catalogs , such as the sdss and 2df , will constrain bias at an accuracy close to the absolute limit determined by systematic errors .",
    "most of our efforts have been centered on reconstructing the bias function itself represents the mean bias .",
    "we have found , however , that part of the scatter is at least , perhaps dominantly , due to poisson scatter .",
    "our reconstruction method corrects for this source of error to the fullest possible extent .",
    "in addition , we have found that a simple shot noise model gives excellent approximation to the stochastic component of the bias .",
    "the expected number of galaxies in region with galaxy density fluctuation is @xmath1 is simply @xmath96 .",
    "if we assume a poisson variance around this value ( and neglect discreteness in the dark matter catalog which is a good approximation ) we have",
    "@xmath97 it follows that @xmath98 .",
    "this simple formula is shown in figure 9 , 11 , 15 and 16 as a shaded area and provides an approximation to the errorbars at typically at the 10% level , with the largest deviation being 50% , mainly at large @xmath84 .",
    "it appears that poisson scatter provides the dominant fraction of the stochasticity of the bias .",
    "note that there are signs of sub - poisson scatter in some of the figures .",
    "the above is hardly more than a toy model , and its degree of success is remarkable .",
    "a convenient parametrization of the ( mean ) bias function relies on a taylor series expansion , @xmath99 we adopted this form to fit our results empirically from the gif and gif - sdss mock catalogs for @xmath100 $ ] .",
    "we have found that an expansion up to @xmath101 is always sufficient .",
    "the results , based on rl inversion , are shown in table 4 & 5 .",
    "it also quantifies the difference between redshift and real space .",
    "for instance , @xmath102 is typically within a few percent for the two cases .",
    "a subtlety with the above formula is worth emphasizing again : in this paper we have related the smoothed galaxy density field to the smoothed dark matter density field .",
    "other methods might use `` unsmoothed '' field , which really means that smoothing is done on a much smaller scales than those scales considered in the measurement .",
    "the meaning of a truly unsmoothed galaxy density field , let alone its taylor series expansion in terms of a truly unsmoothed dark matter density field is somewhat dubious",
    ". as well known , bias and smoothing does not commute , which means that our bias coefficients might have slightly different meaning than the quantities notated with the same letters in other works .",

    "<S> in addition we have found that redshift distortions have a negligible effect on our bias reconstruction , therefore our recipe can be safely applied to redshift surveys . </S>"
