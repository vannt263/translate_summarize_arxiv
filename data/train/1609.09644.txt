    "non - invasive detection of currents is possible thanks to the long - range magnetic field that appears near moving charges , according to the law of biot and savart @xcite .",
    "although a map of the oersted field does not directly reproduce an image of current flow , the current density can for some geometries be rigorously reconstructed . a particularly important class of conductors are two - dimensional structures , such as patterned electronic circuits , semiconductor electron and hole gases , or organic and inorganic thin films . in this case",
    "it is possible to reconstruct the two - dimensional current density from a single component of the magnetic field , recorded in a plane at a fixed distance over the conductor @xcite .",
    "millimeter - to - micrometer current density mapping has been performed by scanning hall probes @xcite , magneto - optical methods @xcite , magnetoresistance probes @xcite , scanning squids @xcite , and diamond chips with large ensembles of nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) centers @xcite .    despite of many challenges , there is a strong incentive to extend current density mapping to higher resolution , especially if the nanometer regime can be reached . at the nanoscale ,",
    "many interesting phenomena may be explored , such as branched electron flow @xcite , weak localization and universal conductance fluctuations @xcite , edge conductance @xcite , dissipation - less currents @xcite , or impurity back - scattering @xcite .",
    "a nanometer scale imaging capability could hence play an important role in mesoscopic condensed matter physics and guide the development of novel materials and circuits .",
    "impressive advances in sub - micrometer current density mapping have recently been made with nano - squids fabricated on the ends of pulled glass capillaries @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we demonstrate sub-30-nm - resolution imaging of current density in patterned nanowire devices at room temperature using a scanning diamond magnetometer .",
    "we find that the technique is ideally suited for current density mapping , as the scanning sensor spin is point - like and naturally provides a single component of the vector magnetic field .",
    "we further show that dc and microwave currents can be mapped and reconstructed separately , providing two independent means for analyzing local current flow .",
    "finally , we demonstrate the potential of the technique by imaging currents flowing in a bundle of carbon nanotubes .",
    "diamond magnetometry uses a single defect spin in a diamond tip to sense the local magnetic field near a sample @xcite .",
    "optically - detected electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) is used to probe the resonance of the spin via application of a microwave field and fluorescence detection @xcite . because the spin resonance shifts with dc magnetic field via the zeeman effect , the resonance frequency is directly proportional to the local magnetic field . by controlled scanning of the diamond tip over the sample , high resolution magnetic images can be obtained .",
    "recent work has mostly focused on magnetic nanostructures @xcite including single electron spins @xcite , thin magnetic films @xcite and surfaces of superconductors @xcite . in the present work",
    "we apply the technique to image charge currents via the oersted magnetic field .",

    "the electron spin resonance ( epr ) frequency of the nv center is continuously measured using microwave irradiation and optical fluorescence detection with a nearby objective ( not shown ) . the magnetic field generated by",
    "the dc current causes a zeeman shift of the epr frequency that can be converted to units of magnetic field .",
    "the nv center only responds to fields that are parallel to its symmetry axis @xmath2 , defined by the angles @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( see inset ) . to map the current density ,",
    "the magnetic field is recorded in an @xmath5 plane at a fixed distance @xmath6 from the surface followed by an image reconstruction .",

    "the key element in our measurement apparatus is a scanning tip with a single nv center at its apex ( fig .",

    "peripheral instrumentation permits optical pumping and readout of the nv spin and its manipulation by microwave magnetic fields .",
    "the tips are prepared by picking up @xmath8-diameter diamond nanoparticles with a commercial atomic force microscopy ( afm ) cantilever @xcite .",
    "the symmetry axis of attached nv centers , which defines the ( @xmath9 ) vector orientation of the sensor ( see fig . [",

    "the bold red line represents a fit to the oersted magnetic field expected from an infinite straight wire with stand - off @xmath21 .",
    "the nv center was oriented along ( @xmath9 ) = ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "( f ) line scan acquired with a different nv tip and a current of @xmath23 . ]",
    "the magnetic field is measured by recording a continuous - wave epr spectrum and determining the peak frequency of the resonance using a lorentzian fit @xcite ( see fig . [",
    "fig : fig2]a - c ) . to eliminate long - term electrical or thermal drift and to discriminate the current - induced field from other magnetic fields ,",
    "we have implemented a differential measurement technique . at each measurement location , two epr spectra are recorded with a positive ( @xmath24 ) or negative ( @xmath25 ) source current applied to the device .",
    "spectra are taken by square wave modulation of the dc source at 1 khz and binning photon counts in synchrony with the modulation . in this way",
    ", low - frequency drift and background signals are efficiently rejected .",
    "the difference between the epr peak frequencies of the two spectra , @xmath26 [ see fig . [",
    "fig : fig2]b ] , then directly corresponds to the component of the oersted field that is parallel to the nv axis , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the electronic spin and @xmath29 is the unit vector along the nv symmetry axis ( see fig . [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the lorentzian fit also yields values for the line width parameter @xmath16 and the optical contrast @xmath17 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : fig2]b ) which can be used to infer the local microwave field @xmath30 , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the saturated optical contrast @xcite .",
    "to develop our current imaging technique , we fabricate several sets of nanowire test devices with different geometries , including straight sections , turns , kinks and splits .",
    "the metallic nanowires are made by e - beam lithography and pt deposition and have cross - sections between @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( see ref . ) .",
    "the devices can be connected to both a dc and microwave source ( @xmath35 ) such that the same nanowire can be used for producing dc fields and actuating the epr transition . to test a device , we scan the nv center laterally across a straight section of a nanowire while applying a current , and record the differential line shift @xmath14 as a function of @xmath36 position ( fig . [",
    "fig : fig2]d , e ) .",
    "this line scan can be compared to an analytical model and allows us to accurately calibrate the stand - off distance @xmath6 ; for the tips used in this study , stand - offs were typically between @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the line scans also provide an estimate of the minimum detectable current . for dc currents , this value is around @xmath39 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]f ) .",
    "the minimum detectable microwave current is in principle much lower , and ultimately limited by the @xmath40 time of the nv spin @xcite . for @xmath41 ,",
    "the magnetic field noise is @xmath42 , corresponding to a noise in the microwave current of a few @xmath43 .",
    "however , because microwave imaging requires precise matching of the spin energy levels to the microwave frequency , we found it difficult to detect microwave currents @xmath44 ( ref . ) .",
    "to demonstrate two - dimensional imaging , we use a y - shaped structure where the current is injected at the bottom ( s ) and collected by the two arms at the top ( d@xmath45 and d@xmath46 , see electron micrograph in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3]a ) . to form a magnetic image of the current flowing in this device ,",
    "the diamond tip is scanned laterally in a plane at fixed @xmath6 spacing from the top of the wire ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the spacing is maintained by briefly approaching and retracting the tip by a known amount before each point .",
    "the resulting magnetic image , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3]b , clearly reflects the geometry of the underlying structure .",
    "since this image is taken with an nv center oriented nearly parallel to the @xmath6 axis , the magnetic field is positive to one side of the wire while it is negative to the other side .",
    "in addition to the dc magnetic field , we can also image the microwave magnetic field by plotting the line width parameter @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3]c ) . for sufficiently strong microwave fields where the optical contrast is saturated ( @xmath47 ) , microwave amplitude and line width are directly proportional , @xmath48 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : bperp ] ) ] .",
    "because both the dc and microwave fields originate from the same conductor ( and neglecting the effects of skin depth and wavelength ) , it can be expected that the two fields have the same spatial distribution .",
    "the vector component picked up in the two imaging modes is , however , orthogonal . while the dc image corresponds to the magnetic field parallel to the spin orientation @xmath2 , the microwave image represents the component transverse to @xmath2 .",
    "this feature can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3]b , c , where the dc field passes through zero right above the conductor while the microwave field is maximized at this location , as expected from the approximately vertical orientation of this nv center .",
    "in a next step , we reconstruct the two - dimensional current density @xmath49 from the dc magnetic image @xmath50 .",
    "this can be achieved by inverting biot and savart s law . for this purpose",
    "we adapt an inverse filtering technique described by roth et al . .",
    "as discussed in the supplemental material ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the reconstructed current density in fourier space is @xmath51 } { b_{||}}({k_x},{k_y},z ) \\   \\\\ { j_y}({k_x},{k_y } ) & = & \\frac{w(k,{\\lambda } ) { k_x}}{g(k , z)\\left[{e_x}{k_x}- { e_y}{k_y}- i{e_z}k\\right ] } { b_{||}}({k_x},{k_y},z ) \\ \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 are @xmath53-space vectors , @xmath54 and where @xmath55 is the sensor orientation .",
    "a similar set of equations can be derived to infer @xmath56 from the microwave field @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath58 is the green s function @xmath59 where @xmath60 is an effective thickness and @xmath61 the physical thickness of the conductor ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "in addition , @xmath62 is a window function required to suppress noise at high spatial frequencies @xmath53 where @xmath58 is small .",
    "we use a hanning window , @xmath63 & \\text{if}\\ |k| < 2\\pi/{\\lambda}\\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise } \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\ , \\label{eq : w}\\ ] ] with cut - off wavelength @xmath64 .",
    "the wavelength @xmath64 plays the role of a spatial filtering parameter that can be tuned to adjust image resolution and noise rejection ( see below ) . beside the hanning filter ,",
    "several optional image processing steps are found to significantly improve the quality of the reconstruction @xcite .",
    "[ fig : fig3]d - f display the results of the reconstruction , which include the magnitude of the current density @xmath65 as well as the individual components @xmath66 and @xmath67 . given that the raw data is rather coarsely sampled and has limited signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , the quality of the reconstruction is quite remarkable .",
    "this apparent improvement is expected , because the reconstruction process inherently acts as a spatial low - pass filter through the cut - off parameter @xmath64 .",
    "excellent agreement is found with the scanning electron micrograph of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3]a .",
    "even fine features , such as the zig - zag structure at the top left corner , are reasonably well resolved , and positive and negative current densities are reliably reproduced .",
    "the magnitudes of the currents entering and exiting through the three arms quantitatively agree with kirchhoff s rule and the nominal source current .",
    "a key feature of scanning diamond magnetometry is the technique s potential for imaging with high spatial resolution and sensitivity . in our experiment",
    ", the resolution can be tuned through the filter parameter @xmath64 . by reducing @xmath64 ,",
    "the resolution is refined up to the point where the noise in the reconstructed image becomes excessive ( see fig . [",
    "fig : fig4]a , b ) .",
    "this occurs at a certain critical wavelength @xmath68 that is of order of the tip stand - off @xmath6 , here @xmath69 .",
    "the critical wavelength is due to the exponential factor in the green s function @xmath70 ( eq . [ eq : g ] ) and the maximum allowed wave vector @xmath71 ( eq . [ eq : w ] ) . to estimate the image resolution",
    ", we can inspect a line cut across the conductor for @xmath72 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4]c ) .",
    "the spatial resolution , defined as the @xmath36 distance over which the signal rises from 15% to 85% of its maximum , is about @xmath73 .",
    "this distance corresponds to @xmath74 of a gaussian convolved with the conductor shape ( sparrow s criterion @xcite ) , and is consistent with the fastest permitted spatial oscillation of @xmath75 .",
    "we can further determine the baseline current density and integrated conductor current as a function of @xmath64 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : fig4]d , e ) .",
    "we find that both quantities are approximately constant when @xmath64 is chosen larger than the critical wavelength @xmath68 .",
    "for the dataset in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , the baseline current density ( root - mean - square value ) is of order @xmath76 .",
    "this converts to a minimum detectable current of @xmath39 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4]e ) , in agreement with our earlier finding .",
    "finally , we explore the application of the technique to detect currents flowing in bundles of carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) . the cnts were vertically grown on si with fe as the catalyst @xcite , dispersed onto a quartz substrate , and contacted by e - beam lithography @xcite .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] shows an example of cnt imaging . in this experiment ,",
    "the line shift @xmath14 has a relatively low signal - to - noise ratio ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5]b ) and the optical contrast @xmath17 ( fig . [ fig : fig5]c ) provides the strongest image contrast .",
    "the line width @xmath77 is approximately constant ( supplemental fig .",
    "this represents the regime of low microwave amplitude where the epr transition is not saturated and @xmath78 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : bperp ] ) and refs . ) . both the @xmath14 and @xmath17 images can be reconstructed ( figs .",
    "[ fig : fig5]d , e ) , with significantly better resolution resulting from the optical contrast data .",
    "the current density image reveals interesting features about the cnt bundle ; in particular , only a center portion of the bundle appears to be conducting while a number of side loops ( arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5]a ) do not carry any measurable current .",
    "in summary , we have shown that the technique of scanning diamond magnetometry enables two - dimensional imaging of current density with sub-30-nm spatial resolution and @xmath39 sensitivity .",
    "the magnetic imaging process is passive , with no direct disturbance of the electron flow , and can be carried out under ambient conditions .",
    "further improvements can be expected as the diamond probe and acquisition techniques are being refined .",
    "for example ,",
    "by replacing our nanodiamond probes with etched single - crystal diamond tips @xcite , a resolution below @xmath79 should be reachable . moreover , pulsed epr techniques could be employed to detect signals via spin echoes @xcite or optimized phase - estimation protocols @xcite , with expected magnetic sensitivities in the @xmath80 range .",
    "together , these advances would lower the current sensitivity to near @xmath81 .",
    "such a capability would allow resolving even weak current density fluctuations , and possibly provide new insight into the local conductance of two - dimensional materials in condensed matter physics .",
