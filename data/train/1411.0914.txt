    "in this paper we consider quotient orbifolds obtained from the action of finite groups on hyperbolic 3-manifolds admitting a heegaard splitting of genus two .    a genus @xmath0 _",
    "heegaard splitting _ of a closed orientable 3-manifold @xmath1 is a decomposition of @xmath1 into a union @xmath2 of two handlebodies of genus @xmath0 intersecting in their common boundary ( the heegaard surface of the splitting ) .",
    "the _ genus of @xmath1 _ is the lowest genus for which @xmath1 admits a heegaard splitting .",
    "the only 3-manifold of genus 0 is the 3-sphere while the genus one 3-manifolds are the lens spaces .",
    "we remark that two is the lowest possible genus for a hyperbolic manifold .",
    "quotient orbifolds of 3-manifolds admitting a heegaard splitting of genus 2 were also studied by j.kim by using different methods ( see @xcite ) . in his paper j.kim considered only groups leaving invariant the heegaard splitting of genus 2 .",
    "here we do not make this assumption . on the other hand",
    "the results in @xcite include also non hyperbolic 3-manifolds .",
    "we recall that 3-bridge knots are strictly related to genus two 3-manifolds .",
    "an _ @xmath3-bridge presentation _ of a knot @xmath4 in the 3-sphere @xmath5 is a decomposition of the pair @xmath6 into a union @xmath7 where @xmath8 for @xmath9 is a 3-ball and @xmath10 is a set of @xmath3 arcs which is trivial in @xmath8 .",
    "we shall say that @xmath4 is an @xmath3-bridge knot if @xmath3 is the minimal number for which @xmath4 admits an @xmath3-bridge presentation .",
    "now a genus two closed orientable surface admits a _",
    "hyperelliptic involution _ , ( i.e. the quotient of the surface by the involution is @xmath11 ) : this involution has the property that , up to isotopy , any homeomorphism of the surface commutes with it .",
    "so for any genus two heegaard splitting of @xmath1 there exists an orientation preserving involution of @xmath1 , which we shall also call _ hyperelliptic _ , which leaves invariant the heegaard splitting and induces the hyperelliptic involution on the heegaard surface ( in contrast with the two - dimensional case , a genus two 3-manifold admits , in general , more than one hyperelliptic involution , even up to isotopy ) .",
    "the quotient of @xmath1 by this involution is topologically @xmath5 and its singular set is a link @xmath12 . in this case",
    "the heegaard splitting of @xmath1 naturally induces a 3-bridge presentation @xmath13 of @xmath12 where @xmath14 for @xmath9 is the quotient of @xmath15 .",
    "conversely , a sphere that induces an @xmath3-bridge presentation of @xmath12 lifts to a heegaard surface of genus @xmath16 of the 2-fold branched covering of @xmath12 .",
    "in particular a 3-bridge presentation induces a genus two heegaard splitting of the 2-fold branched covering .",
    "we can conclude that the hyperbolic 3-manifolds of genus two are exactly the hyperbolic 3-manifolds that are the 2-fold branched covering of a 3-bridge link .",
    "this representation is not unique , in fact there exist",
    "inequivalent 3-bridge knots with the same hyperbolic 2-fold branched covering ( for an example see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5 ) ) .",
    "in @xcite it is proved that a hyperbolic 3-manifold of genus two is the 2-fold branched covering of at most three 3-bridge links .",
    "the representation of 3-manifolds as 2-fold branched coverings of knots and links have been extensively studied ( see for example the survey by l.paoluzzi @xcite and the recent results by j.e.greene @xcite )    in this paper we prove the following theorem about the structure of the quotient orbifolds of hyperbolic 3-manifolds of genus two .",
    "we recall that by the thurston orbifold geometrization theorem , any periodic diffeomorphism of a hyperbolic 3-manifold @xmath1 is conjugate to an isometry of @xmath1 , so we can suppose that the covering transformation of a 3-bridge link is an isometry .",
    "in the following theorem we consider only link symmetries that preserve the orientation of @xmath5 .",
    "[ theo : main ] let @xmath12 be a 3-bridge link and let @xmath1 be the 3-manifold of genus 2 that is the 2-fold branched covering of @xmath12 suppose that @xmath1 is hyperbolic and denote by @xmath17 the orientation preserving isometry group of @xmath1 .    1 .",
    "if @xmath12 is a knot , then the underlying topological space of @xmath18 is either @xmath5 or a lens space and the combinatorial setting of the singular set of @xmath18 is represented in figure  [ theorem - table ] .",
    "if the underlying topological space is a lens space , then the covering transformation of @xmath12 is central in @xmath19 2 .   if @xmath12 has two or three components , the underlying topological space of @xmath20 is @xmath5 , a lens space or a prism manifold .",
    "if the underlying topological space is a prism manifold , then * the group of symmetries of @xmath12 fixing setwise each component and preserving the orientation of @xmath5 is a non - trivial cyclic group , which acts freely on @xmath21 * the symmetries of @xmath12 preserving the orientation of @xmath5 induce a group acting faithfully on the set of the components of @xmath12 that is isomorphic to the symmetry group @xmath22 where @xmath0 is the number of the components .",
    ".,width=340 ]    the proof of the theorem is based on the characterization of the isometry group of the hyperbolic 3-manifolds of genus two given in @xcite .",
    "the underlying topological spaces are analyzed both for knots and links with more than one component . in the knot case , if the underlying topological space is not @xmath5 , then the hyperelliptic involution of @xmath12 is central and each element of @xmath17 projects to a symmetry of @xmath12 ( the 2-fold branched covering has no `` hidden symmetries '' ) .",
    "we remark also that the situation of quotient orbifolds with underlying topological space that is neither the 3 -sphere nor a lens space is very specific .",
    "more details about the quotients are contained in section  [ knot ] and [ link ] . in particular in figure  [ final - table ] the case of knots is summarized , distinguishing for each group , that can occur as @xmath17 , the possible combinatorial settings of the singular set of @xmath23 in principle a similar analysis could be done when @xmath12 is not a knot but in the link case the number of possible graphs for the singular set of @xmath18 is very large and we should obtain a very long and complicated list .",
    "we know that the quotient of a genus two 3-manifold by an hyperelliptic involution is an orbifold with underlying topological space @xmath5",
    ". one might ask if each involution that gives @xmath5 as underlying topological space of the quotient is hyperelliptic .",
    "the answer is no , in fact in the last section of the paper we present an infinite family of genus two 3-manifolds that are the 2-fold branched coverings of knots with bridge number strictly greater than four .",
    "since the bridge number of the knots is not three , the covering involutions of these branched coverings are not hyperelliptic .",
    "this family gives also examples of 2-fold branched coverings where a sphere giving a minimal bridge presentation of the knot does not lift to a heegaard surface of minimal genus . a different method to obtain examples of this phenomenon and some comments about it can be found in [ j ] .",
    "in this section we present some preliminary results about finite group action on 3-manifolds , and in particular on the 3-sphere .",
    "[ prop : normalizer ] let @xmath17 be a finite group of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of a closed orientable 3-manifold and let @xmath24 be an element in @xmath17 with nonempty connected fixed point set .",
    "then the normalizer @xmath25 of the subgroup generated by @xmath24 in @xmath17 is isomorphic to a subgroup of a semidirect product @xmath26 , for some positive integers @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where a generator of @xmath29 ( an @xmath24-reflection ) acts on the normal subgroup @xmath30 of @xmath24-rotations by sending each element to its inverse .",

    "thus the action of an element of @xmath31 is determined by its action on a regular neighborhood of @xmath4 where it is a standard action on a solid torus .",
    "every element of @xmath31 restricts to a reflection ( strong inversion ) or to a ( possibly trivial ) rotation on @xmath4 .",
    "the subgroup of @xmath24-rotations has index one or two in @xmath31 and is abelian .",

    "we remark that all the three constituent knots of @xmath298 are trivial .",
