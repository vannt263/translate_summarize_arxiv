    "the first experimental demonstration in 2008 by the williams group at hewlett - packard  @xcite , over the past four years , memristors  @xcite and memristive systems  @xcite have been extensively investigated on theoretical and experimental fronts  @xcite .",
    "this ongoing research is spread across diverse areas such as modeling memristive systems  @xcite ( including memcapacitors and meminductors )  @xcite , developing memristor emulators  @xcite , the potential use of memristors for high - density non - volatile memory  @xcite , and the development of artifical neural networks  @xcite .",
    "the existence of memristive systems ( or a memristor ) was postulated nearly four decades ago based on symmetry arguments  @xcite , and many examples of their realization , including the charge transport across ion channels  @xcite , were discussed  @xcite .",
    "however , the first simple , physical model that leads to a charge- ( or flux- ) dependent resistance was developed by the williams group  @xcite ; although this model is primarily applicable to a semiconductor thin - film device , it has become a starting point for most of the recent theoretical studies .",
    "the two unusal and remarkable properties of a memristor are its hysteretic behavior in the current - voltage characteristics @xmath0 and the qualitative change in its hysteresis loop structure that takes place when the frequency of the voltage source is much smaller than the characteristic frequency of the memristor in the presence of the applied voltage .",
    "historically , hysteretic behavior is associated with magnetic materials where it has been extensively explored both theoretically and experimentally . since the dependence of the magnetic induction @xmath1 on the field intensity @xmath2 is too complex for an analytical treatment , based on approximate models  @xcite , fourier analysis has been used to study the dependence of magnetization @xmath3 and @xmath4 on a sinusoidally varying field intensity  @xcite .",
    "a corresponding fourier analysis of the response of basic electrical circuit elements to a sinusoidally varying voltage is trivial ; it is nonzero only at the frequency of the applied voltage . similarly ,",
    "fourier analysis of non - linear , passive elements is straightforward .",
    "memristors , with their hysteretic properties and a simple , analytical model of their behavior , are ideally suited for fourier analysis , although such properties are barely explored  @xcite .    in this paper , we present numerical and analytical results for the fourier response of the current @xmath5 through a single memristor with an applied sinusoidal voltage @xmath6 .",
    "our two salient results are as follows : ( i ) a smooth current hysteresis leads to the _ presence of both even and odd harmonics _ of the applied voltage frequency @xmath7 , and the weight of these harmonics decreases monotonically with their degree .",
    "( ii ) when the current hysteresis changes to a sharp , switching behavior , the fourier transform of the current shows a broad , non - monotonic structure ; in particular , _ it has maximum weight at the second harmonic _ over a large range of parameters .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : memmodel ] , we describe the memristor model that takes into account the nonlinear dopant drift .",
    "we present typical numerical results for the fourier analysis of the current and its correlations with the system parameters in sec .",
    "[ sec : num ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , we present a simple analytical model of the hysteretic characteristics and show that this model qualitatively explains the numerical results . we conclude the paper with a brief discussion in sec .  [",
    "sec : disc ] .",
    "we use the model of a memristor as two resistors in series  @xcite : its effective resistance is given by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the fractional width of the doped region with @xmath10 , @xmath11 is total width of the thin - film device , @xmath12 is the resistance of the memristor if the entire device is doped , and @xmath13 is the resistance of the undoped device .",
    "the motion of the boundary between the doped and the undoped regions is approximated by the drift velocity of ( oxygen vacancy ) dopants , and is characterized by the dopant mobility @xmath14 .",
    "the equations describing the time - evolution of a circuit with a single memristor and a voltage source are given by @xmath15 where the polarity @xmath16 denotes that the doped region increases ( decreases ) with an applied positive voltage , and the dimensionless window function @xmath17 is used to model the non - linear drift of dopants near the thin - film boundaries , @xmath18 or @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "the memductance @xmath20 is @xmath21 with @xmath22 , and @xmath23 . in the following numerical calculations , we use @xmath12 as the unit of resistance , @xmath24 as the unit of current , and note that the characteristic frequency of the memristor is given by @xmath25 . to simplify the numerical analysis we use the frequency of the applied voltage @xmath7 as the unit of frequency ( and its period @xmath26 as the unit of time ) , instead of the conventional practice where the memristor frequency sets the scale  @xcite .",
    "the hysteretic effects for different values of @xmath27 are investigated by varying @xmath28 and thus @xmath29 .",
    "typical memristor parameters  @xcite are @xmath30 ohm , @xmath31 nm , @xmath32 @xmath33v@xmath34s@xmath34 , and thus imply that the memristor frequency is @xmath35 khz and the current is @xmath36 ma for @xmath37 v.    we use the following one - parameter family of window functions @xmath38 which ensures that the dopant drift is symmetrically suppressed as @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "note that eq.([eq : window ] ) can be generalized to non - integer values of the parameter @xmath40 by using the absolute value of the argument , @xmath41 .",
    "since the window function vanishes at the boundaries , @xmath42 , it has two fixed points in the time - evolution of the fractional width ; however , this is not of physical concern for the following reason .",
    "suppose the fractional width changes from an initial value @xmath43 to a new value @xmath44 after the passage of charge @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "this process describes the approach to the fixed point @xmath47 .",
    "the charge can be estimated from eq.([eq : drift ] ) by approximating the window function near the boundary , @xmath48 , @xmath49 eq.([eq : charge ] ) shows that the charge @xmath45 required to reach the fixed point , @xmath50 , diverges .",
    "thus , starting from an initial width @xmath51 it is impossible to come across the `` terminal state problem ''  @xcite in a finite amount of time .",
    "an identical argument applies to a memristor where the doped region decreases with time , thus approaching the @xmath52 fixed point .",
    "therefore , in the following , we use the phrase `` saturation of the fractional width '' to denote fractional width @xmath53 arbitrarily close to one ( zero ) without being exactly equal to one ( zero ) .",
    "we calculate the ( discrete ) fourier transform ( ft ) of the memristor current @xmath5 that , in turn , is obtained by numerically solving eqs.([eq : iv])-([eq : drift ] ) over many periods @xmath26 of the applied sinusoidal voltage to ensure stability .",
    "the discrete ft of the current is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the number of points that approximate the continuous function @xmath5 over a single period , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 for @xmath58 are the @xmath55 possible discrete frequencies ; we verify that our results do not depend upon @xmath55 and thus are truly representative of the continuum limit , @xmath59 .     as a function of frequency @xmath60 , and",
    "the right - hand column shows corresponding time - domain @xmath0 curves .",
    "as the ratio of applied voltage frequency to the memristor frequency @xmath61 decreases , the hysteresis changes from smooth ( top row ) to sharp ( center and bottom row ) , and the current ft changes from monotonic decay ( blue circles ) to a broad , bumpy structure ( red squares , black diamonds ) with a maximum weight at the second harmonic ( black diamonds ) . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : ivhyst ] shows typical results of such an analysis .",
    "the left - hand column shows the amplitude of the ft of current , @xmath62 and the right - hand column shows corresponding time - domain @xmath0 curves plotted in the units of @xmath63 and @xmath28 .",
    "note that since the time - integral of the current over a single period is zero , the spectral weight at @xmath64 vanishes in all cases .",
    "these results are obtained with @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and window function parameter @xmath68 .",
    "when @xmath69 , the memristor behaves essentially as an ohmic resistor with constant value and the current ft is nonzero only at @xmath70 .    as @xmath71 decreases ( top row , @xmath72 ) a smooth , pinched hysteresis loop develops in the @xmath0 plane .",
    "the maximum current is @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the initial resistance of the memristor .",
    "the corresponding current ft ( filled blue circles ) shows finite , monotonically and rapidly decreasing weights @xmath75 at harmonics @xmath57 for @xmath76 .",
    "these even and odd higher harmonics are generically present in the regime where the memristor shows hysteresis .",
    "when @xmath77 ( center row ) , the @xmath0 hysteresis loop now has a butterfly shape , and the maximum current is now determined by the significantly smaller resistance value @xmath78 that the memristor reaches when @xmath53 approaches one .",
    "the corresponding current ft ( filled red squares ) shows a broad structure with appreciable , non - monotonic weights at high harmonics @xmath79 with @xmath80 .",
    "the bottom row shows that for @xmath81 , the @xmath0 curve exhibits a clear switching behavior from a state with high resistance @xmath82 to a state with very low resistance @xmath83 accompanied by the saturation of the fractional width @xmath53 .",
    "the fourier transform of the current ( filled black diamonds ) shows that a markedly higher weight at the second harmonic develops compared to the weight at the first harmonic . note",
    "that since the maximum current through the memristor changes by an order of magnitude or more as @xmath71 decreases , the `` small spectral weight '' at high harmonics for @xmath81 ( bottom row ) is , in absolute terms , comparable to the maximum spectral weight of the first harmonic for @xmath72 ( top row ) ; if the latter is experimentally measurable , so will be the former .",
    "thus , the fourier analysis of the memristor current shows two main features .",
    "the first is that a smooth hysteresis curve is accompanied by a current spectrum with monotonically decreasing weights at both even and odd harmonics .",
    "the second is that this spectrum changes to a broad , non - monotonic , bumpy structure with nonzero weights at very high harmonics as the hysteresis curve changes to a butterfly shape characterized by two resistance values .",
    "the question is : is it the frequency @xmath61 that drives this change ?     as a function of frequency @xmath60 and the right - hand column shows the time - evolution of the fractional width @xmath53 over a single period @xmath84 for window functions with @xmath85 ( top row ) , @xmath86 ( center row ) , and @xmath68 ( bottom row ) .",
    "these typical results suggest that the qualitative change in the current ft is triggered by the saturation of the fractional width . ]    to investigate the connection , if any , between the broad spectrum of the current ft and the saturation of the fractional width , we obtain @xmath75 for different window functions while keeping all other parameters constant .",
    "the right - hand column in fig .",
    "[ fig : hystp ] shows the time - evolution of @xmath53 from its initial value @xmath87 for three values of @xmath88 ; the left - hand column shows corresponding amplitude of the current ft . when @xmath85 the highly non - linear window function reduces the dopant drift velocity and therefore the fractional width reaches a maximum @xmath89 that is well below saturation ( top row ) ; the corresponding @xmath75 shows monotonically decreasing weights at harmonics @xmath57 for @xmath90 ( filled blue circles ) . for @xmath86",
    "the dopant drift is higher , the fractional width barely reaches saturation at @xmath91 ( center row ) , and the current ft now shows a broad , non - monotonic , bumpy structure ( filled red squares ) .",
    "the bottom row shows that when @xmath68 , the dopant drift is essentially constant , the dimensionless width saturates to one for a significant fraction of the period @xmath92 , and the current spectrum now shows maximum weight at the second harmonic ( filled black diamonds ) .",
    "we emphasize that these results are for a single value of the memristor frequency , @xmath93 .",
    "these numerical results strongly suggest that saturation of the fractional width is instrumental to the qualitative change in the current spectrum and the emergence of higher - weight second harmonic .",
    "they show , in particular , that neither the frequency @xmath71 nor the dopant drift dynamics , characterized by the window function index @xmath94 , solely drive the emergence of higher harmonics with increasing weights .",
    "armed with these insights , we now present a theoretical model that qualitatively explains the properties of current fourier transform in terms of time evolution of the memductance . in general , the fourier transform of current @xmath5 is given by the convolution , @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 denotes fourier transforms of the memductance @xmath98 and the applied voltage respectively . for a sinusoidal voltage , eq.([eq : convo ] )",
    "becomes @xmath99,\\ ] ] where we have used @xmath100 .",
    "thus , an analytical model for the memductance ft @xmath101 can shed light on the evolution of the current fourier transform .    we start with the case when the fractional width @xmath53 does not saturate ( top - right panel in fig .  [ fig : hystp ] ) . then the current can be expressed as sum of two , low - order , odd polynomials in voltage @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the heaviside function , and the sign of @xmath104 denotes whether the voltage is increasing with time or decreasing .",
    "for example , the hysteresis for @xmath72 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ivhyst ] can be modeled by using @xmath105 and @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 , whereas when @xmath109 , @xmath110 .",
    "although the polynomials are odd functions of time , due to the presence of the heaviside function , the fourier transform of eq.([eq : pq ] ) contains both even and odd harmonics .",
    "we note that although such approximation works well for the most part , for any degree polynomial , it can not capture the diverging slope of the @xmath0 curve that occurs at the voltage extrema , @xmath111 . for a power - law current with a single exponent , @xmath112 , and sinusoidal voltage ,",
    "the fourier transform is given by @xmath113 the binomial coefficient , and therefore the spectral weight @xmath75 , decreases monotonically with the order of the harmonic @xmath114 ; note that @xmath115 for @xmath116 .",
    "it follows from stirling s approximation that the current ft will decay rapidly as @xmath117 for large @xmath118 .",
    "this exponential nature of the decay does not depend upon the power - law exponent @xmath119 , and is applicable to a general polynomial @xmath120 .",
    "thus , the two - polynomial model qualitatively explains the monotonically decreasing weight at even and odd harmonics for the current ft .",
    "( top panel ) and the memductance @xmath121 ( bottom panel ) over a single period @xmath84 .",
    "the system parameters are @xmath65 , @xmath68 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , which implies that @xmath124 .",
    "the results show that although the fractional width slowly saturates to one over time ( top panel ) , @xmath98 increases sharply from @xmath125 to @xmath126 at time @xmath127 ( bottom panel ) . ]    when the fractional width @xmath53 saturates at low frequencies , the memductance @xmath98 increases from its initial value @xmath128 to a maximum value of @xmath126 .",
    "figure  [ fig : gwvstime ] shows the typical time evolution of the fractional width @xmath53 ( top panel ) and the corresponding memductance @xmath98 ( bottom panel ) as a function of @xmath71 . in general @xmath98 can be approximated by a piecewise constant function , @xmath129 where @xmath130 is determined by the system parameters ; for example , @xmath131 when @xmath132 and monotonically decreases with @xmath71 .",
    "its fourier transform is given by @xmath133 the presence of the sinc - function in @xmath101 and the fact that @xmath134 imply that memductance spectral weight @xmath135 is non - monotonic and its higher harmonics decay slowly as @xmath136 for large @xmath118 .",
    "then it follows from eq.([eq : cv2 ] ) that the broad , bumpy structure of the current ft arises from the same source .",
    "in this paper , we have presented numerical results for the fourier response of the current through a single memristor in the presence of a sinusoidal voltage . with simple models",
    ", we have shown that the qualitative change in the current ft can be traced to the qualitative change in the hysteresis loop in the @xmath0 plane .",
    "the results presented here are for a positive polarity , @xmath67 , where the fractional width saturates to one .    when @xmath137 , the memductance of the device _ decreases _ from @xmath138 to @xmath139 .",
    "thus , to obtain a ratio of the initial and saturation memductance values comparable to the positive polarity case , we will need an initial fractional width @xmath19 .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the frequency @xmath71 required for width saturation down to zero is much smaller than the corresponding values in the positive polarity case .",
    "therefore , non - monotonic current spectrum and higher - weight second harmonic response  @xcite in negative polarity memristors require significantly different conditions .",
    "our approach can be used to analytically investigate other phenomena , such as power in a load resistor @xmath140 in series with a memristor , @xmath141  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath140 is constant , the form the current - voltage hysteresis and the subsequent results remain the same . since @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the power ft ,",
    "our results can be used to understand its behavior  @xcite .",
