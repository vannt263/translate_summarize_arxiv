    "ultracompact ( uc ) hii regions are small ( size @xmath2 0.1 pc ) , dense ( @xmath3 10@xmath4 @xmath5 ) , photoionized hydrogen regions with high emission measure ( @xmath3 10@xmath6 @xmath7 ) , surrounding recently formed ionizing ob type stars ( e.g. fig .",
    "these characteristics were observationally confirmed by @xcite and @xcite , and more recent reviews are presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the study of uc  hii regions began in 1967 via interferometric observations of compact hii regions ( see @xcite for a summary ) . because uc  hii regions are generally surrounded by a natal dust ` cocoon ' , radio  continuum ( rc ) and infrared ( ir ) observations",
    "are needed to study them . in the rc ,",
    "the first vla surveys ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) were made at 2 and 6 cm in configurations a and b , supplying arc ",
    "sec resolutions and sensitivities to structures up to 1020@xmath8 .",
    "the ir counterparts were mainly provided by iras , with resolutions of @xmath930@xmath82@xmath1 .",
    "although the presence of large scale structures related to uc  hii regions ( fig . 1b and 8c of @xcite ) had been inferred since 1967 , the first interferometric surveys did not detect them .",
    "nevertheless , their detection is possible with the vla c and d configurations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , albeit at the expense of resolution towards the uc emission ( uce ) . to mitigate these spatial filtering effects",
    ", we made multi ",
    "configuration vla observations to provide a multi - scale view of the uc  hii+ee ( fig.1c ) . also , by using msx observations , of higher resolution than iras , it is possible both to detect the ee and to resolve the uce , since the infrared observations are sensitive to the full range of angular sizes .",
    "the best ir satellite observations available for this purpose ( see fig .",
    "1d ) are from the spitzer space telescope ( _ http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu_ ) .",
    "comparing the total ionizing flux from the exciting star(s ) calculated using rc and fir observations , it is possible to analyze the energetics of the uc  hii regions .",
    "the spectral type of the exciting star can be estimated in two ways : via the rc and via the iras fluxes . in the former case , the ionizing photon rate , _",
    "n@xmath10 _ , is estimated from vla observations ( eq . 1 of @xcite ) of the ionized gas .",
    "in the latter case , the total luminosity is measured via iras fluxes , and this luminosity is converted to an ionizing photon rate , n*@xmath11 , using model stellar atmospheres ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . both estimates consider an ionization  bounded , dust  free nebula .",
    "n@xmath10 represents a lower limit to the spectral type because it is the minimum flux required to maintain the observed uc  hii region ; n*@xmath11 represents an upper limit to the spectral type ( for a single star producing l@xmath12 ) .",
    "a more realistic case is the presence of a stellar cluster and also of dust , as was considered by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "assuming a spectral type for the most massive member of the cluster , and comparing it with the spectral type based on n@xmath10 and n*@xmath11 ( table 18 in @xcite and table 7 in @xcite ) , they found that n*@xmath11 ( iras fluxes ) and a single - star assumption resulted in the earliest estimate for the spectral type .",
    "the spectral type estimated from n@xmath10 was always of somewhat later type .",
    "the spectral type derived for the most massive member of a cluster was roughly similar to that derived from the radio continuum .",
    "this suggests that there is a significant amount of dust in the regions , and many of the uv stellar photons do not contribute to the ionization but heat the dust instead .",
    "another important result is that the luminosity derived from iras suggests a much greater ( earlier or more numerous ) stellar presence than does the vla luminosity .",
    "is quantified as f@xmath13 = 1@xmath14 = 1@xmath15(n@xmath10 / n*@xmath11 ) , where f@xmath16 and @xmath17 are the fraction of uv photons absorbed by dust and gas respectively .",
    "values of f@xmath16 @xmath9 1 indicate a large ir  excess .",
    "surveys by @xcite and @xcite found 0.42  @xmath18  f@xmath16  @xmath18  0.99 for 29 sources .    on the other hand , the presence of ee in a",
    "_ direct connection _ with the uc emission ( i.e. , a common structure of ionized gas embracing both emissions ; see fig . 1c and fig . 3 of @xcite ) would significantly impact on our understanding of uc  hii regions .",
    "it may imply that the definition , modeling , lifetime problem , and energetics of uc  hii regions should be reconsidered .",
    "for example , as was pointed out in @xcite and @xcite , if a direct connection is present , and if we consider a single ionizing star , the ee requires @xmath9  1020 times more lyman photons to maintain its ionization than the needed by the uce .",
    "so , if the lyman photons are underestimated in the n@xmath10 determinations of @xcite and @xcite , then the role of dust and the presence of clusters may have been over  estimated .    in light of the above",
    ", studies to understand and clarify the nature of the ee are needed . to date",
    ", only four efforts have been made .",
    "the first effort was made by kurtz et al .",
    "( 1999 ; @xcite ) with a sample of 15 uc  hii regions . for 12 of them , they reported new , low  resolution vla conf .",
    "d data at 3.6 cm ( resolution of 9@xmath8 and sensitivity to 9@xmath1 structures ) .",
    "they contrasted these observations with those reported by @xcite ( conf .",
    "b at 3.6 cm , resolution @xmath9 0.9@xmath8 ; sensitivity to about 1020@xmath8 ) and the nvss ( conf .",
    "d at 20 cm , resolution @xmath9  45@xmath8 ; sensitivity to about 715@xmath1 ) . the aim was to detect a direct connection between the uce and the ee , via a morphological study .",
    "if the uce fits into a larger continuous structure , a direct connection could be possible .",
    "if a falloff in the emission to a near  zero value is observed between the uce and the ee ( a weak or null contour in the map ) , the direct connection could be unlikely .",
    "from the 15 fields , they found ee in 12 , and evidence for a direct connection was present in eight .",
    "they calculate n@xmath10 using the low  resolution vla data and find that n@xmath10 is similar to n*@xmath11 .",
    "the second effort was made by kim & koo ( 2001 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is based on a previous single ",
    "object ( g5.480.24 ) study ( @xcite ) .",
    "they studied 16 sources with the vla conf .",
    "dnc at 20 cm with resolution @xmath9 30@xmath8 and sensitivity up to 15@xmath1 .",
    "these observations included rc and h76@xmath19 , he76@xmath19 radio  recombination lines ( rrl s ) .",
    "they found ee in all sources , h76@xmath19 in 15 and he76@xmath19 in six .",
    "based on the rrl data , they found similar lsr velocities in the uce and ee , suggesting a direct connection between the two .",
    "they also present a theoretical model to explain the observed ee ( density gradient in the molecular cloud plus a champagne flow ) .",
    "the third effort was made by ellingsen et al .",
    "( 2005 ; @xcite ) .",
    "they observed eight young ( based on methanol maser emission ) uc  hii regions with the atca at 3.5 cm in the 750d configuration ( resolution and sensitivity similar to vla conf .",
    "d at 3.6 cm ) . in a similar way as @xcite , they contrasted their observations with other atca high resolution observations reported in the literature .",
    "they found ee with smaller sizes than the ones in the sample of @xcite , and explain that this effect may be due to a younger sample selected . also , they support the theoretical model of @xcite .",
    "the most recent effort was performed by de la fuente ( @xcite ) for a sample of 29 uc  hii regions .",
    "the results will be published in a series of forthcoming papers .",
    "the aims were : ( 1 ) to complement and confirm the results and assumptions of @xcite with a sample of 14 regions ( 12 from @xcite plus g35.201.74 and g19.600.23 ) ; and ( 2 ) to explain how the presence of ee can affect the ir ",
    "excess ( f@xmath16 ) , in the complete sample that includes 15 regions in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "values of f@xmath16 @xmath0 0.8 were found for this uce sample .",
    "the methodology employed includes , when available , nir ( 2mass ) , mir ( irac @xcite from the glimpse program , _ http://www.astro.wisc.edu/sirtf/_ ) , and rc ( vla at 3.6 cm in configurations d , c , and b ) observations .",
    "rc traces the ionized gas while nir and mir are good tracers of the stellar population and dust , respectively .",
    "with irac it is possible to detect dust and pah emission at 3.6 , 5.8 and 8.0  @xmath20 m . shocked gas can be observed through h@xmath21 emission at 4.5  @xmath20 m .",
    "the 3.6  @xmath20 m ( spitzer ) and the k@xmath22 ( 2.12  @xmath20 m , 2mass ) images can show the presence of stellar clusters and nebulosities ( ionized or reflection nebula ) . with ir photometry of these data , it is possible to identify the yso population . here",
    ", we summarize only the results regarding irac imagery and vla maps .    combining new vla observations in conf .",
    "c with previous data in conf .",
    "b and d , a multi  resolution ",
    "clean ( mrc ) map was created ( e.g. , fig .",
    "if this map shows that the extended and uc emission form part of a continuous structure , then the suggestion of a direct connection is strong .    this behavior was confirmed in seven of the 14 regions in our sample .",
    "it was not seen in two ( g33.130.09 and g48.61 + 0.02 ) , and it is probable in five , although other observations ( e.g. , irac ) are needed to confirm . in general , the results of @xcite were confirmed for some of the sources , however , further observation and analysis is required for the others . for example , for g78.44 + 2.66 and g106.80 + 5.31 , the mrc maps do not confirm a direct connection between the uce and the ee ( in agreement with @xcite ) , nevertheless , the k@xmath22 image shows a nebulosity covering both emission regions .",
    "irac images ( not currently available ) could confirm the nature of the nebulosities .",
    "using new vla conf .",
    "d observations at 3.6 cm for the 15 sources to complete the sample of 29 , a determination of f@xmath16 was computed . also in these new rc maps , ee is present in all sources .",
    "based on their morphology , and following @xcite , a direct connection is also strongly suggested in 12 of the 15 regions .",
    "the cometary morphology was predominant in the whole sample . confirming that the 29 sources present ee and ir  excess , a comparison between f@xmath16 ( conf .",
    "d ) and f@xmath16 ( conf .",
    "b ) was performed . for all sources ,",
    "the presence of ee reduces the values of f@xmath16 . in summary ,",
    "10 regions have f@xmath16 ( conf .",
    "d ) @xmath9  0.2 , another 10 regions @xmath9  0.6 , and the other 9 , @xmath9  0.7 .    the pah emission is a good tracer of the `` radiation temperature '' and the irac 8 @xmath20 m band is dominated by this emission ( predominant at 7.7  @xmath20 m ) .",
    "the striking comparison between the irac images and the vla rc images ( see fig.1d ) suggests that the ee is due to ionizing radiation .",
    "however , soft uv radiation which may not significantly contribute to the overall hii region could be an important ionization source for the ee .",
    "in the 8.0  @xmath20 m image , several knot  like sources are observed .",
    "they could be either star clusters or externally illuminated condensations .",
    "furthermore , the 8.0  @xmath20 m band can effectively trace weak structures and has proven useful in unveiling the underlying physical structure of the dense core / cloud ( e. g. , @xcite , @xcite ) . also , an agreement between the location of the rc emission peaks in the cometary arcs and the strongest emission in irac bands was observed .    in summary , the ee seems to be common in uc hii regions and is deserving of special attention in forthcoming studies and analysis .",
    "multi - configuration vla maps are critical to study morphologically the direct connection between uc  hii regions and their associated ee .",
    "irac has been revealed as a powerful tool to study uc  hii regions ( with or without ee ) .",
    "the ee helps to explain the ir ",
    "excess observed because the n@xmath10 calculated in @xcite and @xcite under  estimated the ionizing lyman photons .",
    "nevertheless , the over  estimation of dust in the regions is not necessarily true . on the other hand , in several sources",
    "the presence of clusters of stars in the uc  hii+ee is inferred , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "hence , the assumptions of a single ionizing star and dust free nebula are not necessarily valid in the energetic studies .",
    "all the efforts are complementary , and individually none of them clarify the whole scenario .",
    "more studies are needed to clarify the nature , formation and evolution of the ee .",
    "a starting point is to standardize the observations ( molecular , hi , vla multi ",
    "configuration , rrl s , and spitzer ) of all sources presented in these efforts . combining these observations it is possible : 1 ) to confirm the validity of the model presented by @xcite .",
    "2 ) to measure the extinction .",
    "if similar extinction is measured in the uce and ee , then it is possible to guarantee a direct relation between these components .",
    "this could be done by comparing nir recombination lines with rc images .",
    "3 ) to compare hi , rc , and irac observations looking for a relation between hii regions and pdr s .",
