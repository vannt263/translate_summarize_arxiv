    "<S> 4 the decay distribution @xmath163 , divided by the total width @xmath164 , is given for @xmath146 . </S>",
    "<S> for illustration we also give the spectra predicted using the schrdinger and dirac wavefunctions for a point nucleus . comparing these two curves </S>",
    "<S> shows that relativistic effects not only change the overall normalization but cause the spectrum to peak at higher momenta . </S>",
    "<S> the finite nuclear size causes the shape of the spectrum as calculated for a point nucleus to narrow . </S>",
    "<S> this can easily be understood by looking at the muonic wavefunction in fig .  2 . </S>",
    "<S> in fig .  5 the same distribution is shown for @xmath149 ; as might be expected both relativistic effects and the effect of a finite nuclear size are small . </S>",
    "<S> transitions of the form @xmath165 have as their signature a bound state recoiling with a large momentum the order of @xmath52 . the momentum distribution for heavy atoms ( @xmath146 ) peaks at about 20 mev as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that transitions between electromagnetic bound states can be calculated reliably using relativistic atomic wavefunctions . </S>",
    "<S> the rates and also the shapes of the spectra depend drastically on relativistic corrections ; for heavy muonic atoms these enhance the branching ratio to a sizeable value of @xmath166 from @xmath167 ( see eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ diracres ] ) and ( [ schrres ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the qed analysis of these alchemy transitions illustrates some of the physics of the relativistic wavefunctions that must invariably enter the qcd analysis of the corresponding exclusive electroweak decays of hadrons .    </S>",
    "<S> prospects for an experimental test of atomic alchemy are dim but not hopeless . </S>",
    "<S> while the branching ratio appears to be too small to be detectable for @xmath55 or for light muonic atoms , it may be possible to detect it for heavy muonic atoms . </S>",
    "<S> one promising approach is to inject and capture @xmath168  kev muons in a cyclotron trap  @xcite containing @xmath169  bar of a noble gas , which we will here assume to be neon ( @xmath149 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the muons will come to rest  @xcite in @xmath170  @xmath171 and be captured by a neon atom . </S>",
    "<S> the muons will rapidly cascade to the @xmath36 state , mostly by the ejection of atomic electrons . in neon the mean number of electrons in the k  shell </S>",
    "<S> has been measured @xcite to lie between @xmath172 and @xmath173 by the time the muon has fallen to states with principal quantum number @xmath174 , in agreement with simple estimates  @xcite of 0.25 , and will certainly diminish further as the muon continues to the @xmath36 state . </S>",
    "<S> total ionization of an atom has been observed in the cascades of antiprotons in neon , argon , and krypton  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the electron k shell will therefore be vacant to receive the electron from atomic alchemy . </S>",
    "<S> only @xmath175 of the muons in the @xmath36 state of neon will be lost to muon capture  @xcite , so most of the captured muons will be available to decay by atomic alchemy . at a pressure of @xmath169  bar , using estimates in @xcite for the velocity of muonic neon ion ( @xmath176 ) and for the cross section for electron </S>",
    "<S> capture for @xmath177 on @xmath178 ( @xmath179 ) , the time taken for a bare neon atom to capture an electron is the order of @xmath180 , so most of the captured muons will decay before the electron k  shell can refill and block the atomic alchemy . </S>",
    "<S> it has been suggested  @xcite that cyclotron traps , admittedly with higher gas pressures , can be built capable of stopping @xmath181 , so a branching ratio as small as @xmath182 might be accessible .    even if such a system could be realized the experimental difficulties would be daunting . </S>",
    "<S> the signature for atomic alchemy is the appearance of @xmath183 ions with a distribution @xmath184 extending to a momentum the order of @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> these ions will be difficult to distinguish from @xmath185 ions with a momentum of @xmath52 made by internal conversion . </S>",
    "<S> nor will it be easy to extract the ions for analysis because in @xmath186 bar of neon the distance a bare ion can fly before capturing an electron is only @xmath187 , and the gas pressure can not be lowered without letting the muons in the trap decay in flight before they can be captured . </S>",
    "<S> however , measurement of the spectrum @xmath184 would be valuable ; it directly reflects the local structure of the atomic momentum space wavefunction and the beta decay spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> this appears to be one of the few ways in which one can directly study the relativistic tail of bound state wavefunctions in qed .    for induced reactions , such as @xmath188 </S>",
    "<S> , one will observe a nearly monoenergetic final state hydrogen atom recoiling against an outgoing neutron . in principle </S>",
    "<S> one can use the doppler - shifted radiation from the outgoing atoms as a precise calibration of the nuclear scattering kinematics . </S>",
    "<S> one could also analyze the spin states of the outgoing atomic system and its hyperfine spectrum as a probe of the spin state of the final state nucleus .    </S>",
