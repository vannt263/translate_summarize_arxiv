    "the most general electromagnetic medium can be defined in terms of 36 parameters , either in terms of four medium dyadics as # d_g + # b_g= = & = + = & = .#e_g + # h_g , db in three - dimensional representation for gibbsian vector fields denoted by @xmath0 , @xmath1,@xmath2 and @xmath3 , or in terms of a single medium dyadic as % = m|%psimphi , applying four - dimensional differential - form representation for electromagnetic fields and media @xcite . in the latter case the field two - forms @xmath4 and @xmath5 can be expressed as % = # d - # h#d ,  % = # b + # e#d , psiphiin terms of three - dimensional ( spatial ) two - forms @xmath6 and one - forms @xmath7 when @xmath8 is the differential operator and @xmath9 is the normalized time .",

    "the notation in this paper follows that given in @xcite .",
    "the medium dyadic @xmath10 has a natural ( independent of any basis system ) decomposition in three parts as m = m_1 + m_2 + m_3 and the dyadics @xmath12 are respectively called principal , skewon and axion components of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the axion part is a multiple of the unit dyadic which in the notation of @xcite can be expressed as m_3 = m_3^(2)t , m3while both @xmath13 and @xmath14 are trace - free dyadics .",
    "the components @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be defined so that the dyadics contracted by a quadrivector @xmath15 as @xmath16 and @xmath17 are respectively symmetric and antisymmetric . physical properties of these components are discussed in @xcite .",
    "the total number of 36 parameters is distributed by the three components so that the principal part @xmath13 , corresponding to a trace - free symmetric @xmath11 matrix has 20 parameters , the skewon part @xmath14 , corresponding to an antisymmetric @xmath11 matrix , has 15 parameters , and the axion part @xmath18 , has 1 parameter .",
    "a medium consisting only of its axion parameter , @xmath19 in , has been called pemc , perfect electromagnetic conductor , because it is a generalization of both pmc ( @xmath20 ) and pec ( @xmath21 ) , @xcite .",
    "the medium equations for the pemc can be expressed in the simple form # d = m#b ,  # h =- m#e .",
    "one can show that the most general medium with no principal component , the skewon - axion medium @xcite ( also called as the ib - medium @xcite ) , can be expressed in terms of a dyadic @xmath22 , corresponding to a @xmath23 matrix involving only 16 parameters , as m = ( b)^t= ( b)^t .",
    "mibit will turn out that a plane wave in the most general skewon - axion medium is not governed by a dispersion equation , normally restricting the choice of the @xmath24 vector in a given medium .",
    "thus , basically , one can choose any @xmath24 vector for a plane wave in such a medium .",
    "in @xcite the problem of plane wave reflection from the planar interface of a uniaxial skewon - axion medium , defined by six medium parameters , was analyzed .",
    "it was shown that , despite the absence of any dispersion equation , the @xmath24 vector in the skewon - axion medium was uniquely determined by the interface conditions .",
    "moreover , it was shown that the interface conditions serve as boundary conditions # n#d_g=0 ,  # n#b_g=0 , dbcondfor gibbsian fields at the interface of the uniaxial skewon - axion medium , dubbed as the db conditions @xcite .",
    "it subsequently turned out that such conditions were defined already in 1959 @xcite and that they are known to have unique mathematical properties @xcite .",
    "the db conditions have been shown to play a central role in electromagnetic cloaking problems @xcite .",
    "more recently , the same db conditions were shown to emerge at the interface of a simple skewon medium defined by just one parameter in the medium conditions @xcite # d = n#b ,  # h = n#e , nwhich differ slightly those of the pemc ( axion medium ) in .",
    "fields in the skewon - axion medium can be compacly handled applying the four - dimensional formalism @xcite .",

    "3d to conclude , any fields in a skewon - axion medium defined by and must satisfy the conditions and .",
    "let us interprete the result and in terms of three - dimensional gibbsian vectors applying the rules given in the appendix . denoting again the gibbsian vectors by the subscript @xmath32",

    "we have tacitly assumed that the fields are time harmonic as @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "thus , the conditions and can be represented in the following form for the gibbsian field vectors , t#e_3#b_g + k_o#e_2#e_g&=&0 , 3bg + t#e_3#d_g - k_o#e_2#h_g&=&0 , 3dg and they are satisfied by any fields in the skewon - axion medium under consideration .",
    "one may note that the pair of conditions is invariant in the duality transformation @xmath39 , @xmath40 which leave the maxwell equations invariant .",
    "assuming now a planar interface at @xmath41 , with normal unit vector @xmath42 , between the skewon - axion medium and an isotropic medium ( parameters @xmath43 ) , the conditions and , and their gibbsian counterparts and , are actually continuous across the interface .",
    "since these conditions at the interface are enough to determine the fields in the isotropic medium without having to solve for the fields behind the interface , they can be considered as boundary conditions .",
    "although and were introduced through a consideration of a planar interface , their form is applicable to curved boundaries as well , with @xmath42 and @xmath44 denoting respective unit vectors normal and tangential to the boundary surface .",
    "the boundary defined by , appears as a generalization of both the db boundary defined by the conditions and the soft - and - hard ( sh ) boundary @xcite defined by the conditions # e_2#e_g=0 ,  # e_2#h_g=0 . in fact , the sh conditions are obtained for the limiting parameter value @xmath45 while the db conditions are obtained from , for @xmath46 . for convenience , the more general boundary defined by and and combining both sh and db conditions",
    "will be called the shdb boundary .",
    "one can immediately observe that , due to its self - dual property , an object with rotational symmetry and shdb boundary should appear invisible to the radar because the back - scattering cross section of such an object is zero @xcite .",
    "the skewon - axion medium was defined in terms of four - dimensional quantities through , . for",
    "the convenience of readers not familiar with the four - dimensional formalism and for double - checking the results , let us now find the relation between the skewon medium interface and the boundary consitions , in terms of three - dimensional gibbsian vectors and dyadics .",
    "for that purpose we first find the gibbsian medium conditions by expanding ( b)^t= 2b^(2)t - ( _ 3^t#a+ ( _ 1 + a_4)^t#b ) , and expand @xmath47 = _",

    "the medium conditions can be written for the gibbsian vectors as # d_g & = & 2b#b_g -#e_3(#a_s#b_g)-#e_1(#b_s#b_g ) + & & -(a_4#e_3+b_4#e_1)#e_g , + # h_g & = & -a#b_s#b_g -(ab_4 + 2b)#e_g + & & -(#e_3#a_s+#e_1#b_s)#e_g.expressing the gibbsian medium conditions in the form # d_g + # h_g= = & =  + = ^-1 & = . # b_g + # e_g , where the medium dyadics are understood in the gibbsian sense , their expressions become = & = & 2b_g -#e_3(#a_s_g)-#e_1(#b_s_g ) , aa + =  & = & -(a_4#e_3+b_4#e_1)_g , + = ^-1 & = & -a#b_s_g , + = & = & -(ab_4 + 2b)_g -(#e_3#a_s+#e_1#b_s ) .",
    "bbone must notice that the dyadics @xmath52 and @xmath53 are antisymmetric and , consequently , do not have inverses .",
    "thus , it is not possible to express the skewon - axion medium equations in the form .",

    "the pure axion ( pemc ) medium special case is obtained for  = _s ,  # c=0 ,  # g=0 ,  a = m/2 .",
    "let us consider the basic problem , reflection of a plane wave from the planar interface of the skewon - axion half space @xmath61 , in terms of gibbsian quantities corresponding to time - harmonic fields .      denoting for simplicity # p=#k / ",

    "considering a plane wave in terms of three - dimensional gibbsian vector fields , it is shown that there is no characteristic equation for the vector @xmath24 in the medium which leaves a lot of freedom for the definition of the wave .    in this paper a certain class of skewon - axion media is studied whose number of parameters is limited to 10 .",
    "such a medium has three specified axes denoted by the constant orthogonal unit vectors @xmath128 and @xmath42 .",
    "it is shown that , in such a medium , two scalar conditions , are satisfied by the four gibbsian field vectors .",
    "the form of the conditions suggests that , if there is a planar interface orthogonal to the vector @xmath42 , and serve as boundary conditions for the fields .",
    "since the conditions generalize those obtained for the soft - and - hard ( sh ) boundary and for the db boundary for the limiting cases of the free parameter @xmath36 , the novel boundary has been dubbed as the shdb boundary .",
    "plane wave reflection from a shdb boundary was considered and analytical expressions for the reflected field components were derived .",
    "it was shown that , for two eigenpolarizations , the shdb boundary can be replaced by effective pec and pmc boundaries just like for the sh and db boundaries .",
    "the theory was tested by a numerical example demonstrating the nonreciprocal property of the shdb boundary .",
    "although it appears quite easy to define the generalized boundary conditions and , quite simple in form , one may note that their realization in terms of a medium interface is not so obvious .",
    "in fact , it appears that , without the four - dimensional formalism , the introduction of the skewon - axion medium is a difficult task . also , it is not at all obvious that a medium defined by and with  will yield a set of boundary conditions since it does not pop out directly from the medium equations but requires consideration of fields in the medium .",
    "realization of the skewon - axion medium by some metamaterial is a challenge for which there may not exist an easy solution .",
    "however , since the boundary conditions and appear more important than the medium itself , it should be easier to realize the shdb boundary , whenever a useful engineering application for the boundary has been discovered . a corresponding realization for the db boundary",
    "was recently found in terms of a planar structure containing metamaterial inclusions @xcite .",
    "the connection between spatial multiforms and gibbsian vectors can be expressed according to the following rules which are based on the spatial metric dyadic _g = # e_1#e_1 + # e_2#e_2 + # e_3#e_3 , which serves as the gibbsian unit dyadic .",
    "thus , a spatial one - form @xmath129 is transformed to a gibbsian vector as % _",
    "s  % _ g = _g|%_s = _ 1#e_1 + _ 2#e_2",
    "+ _ 3#e_3 .",
    "similarly , a spatial two - form @xmath130 is transformed as # b  # b_g = # e_123#b = b_12#e_3 + b_23#e_1 + b_31#e_2 .",
    "the bar product of a spatial vector @xmath131 and a spatial one - form @xmath132 transforms to a dot - product of gibbsian vectors , # a_s|%_s  # a_s%_g = # a_s_g|%_s = # a_s|%_s .",
    "the wedge product of two spatial one - forms @xmath133 becomes the cross product of two gibbsian vectors , % _",
    "s%_s  % _",
    "g%_g = # e_123(%_s%_g ) , and the wedge product of three one - forms transforms to a scalar , % _",
    "s%_s%_s  % _",
    "g(%_g%_g)= % _ s|(#e_123(%_s%_s ) ) .",
    "finally , the contraction product of a spatial vector @xmath131 and a spatial two - form @xmath134 is transformed to the cross product of the gibbsian vectors @xmath131 and @xmath1 as # a_s#b  # a_s#b_g = _g|(#a_s#b ) .",
