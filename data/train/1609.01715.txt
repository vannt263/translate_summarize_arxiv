    "nuclear stellar clusters , ( nscs ) hosting massive black holes ( mbhs ) are thought to exist in a significant fraction of all galactic nuclei , including our own @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of stars in the dense nsc lead to strong interactions between stars and the mbh",
    ". in particular compact objects ( cos ) such as white dwarfs ( wds ) , neutron stars ( nss ) , and stellar black holes ( sbhs ) , may inspiral onto the mbh and emit gravitational waves ( gws ) observable to cosmological distances with next generation gw detectors .",
    "the inspiral of a co into an mbh ( extreme mass ratio inspiralemri ] ) is among the main targets of future evolved laser interferometer space antenna ( elisa ) .",
    "the properties of emris and their rates depend strongly on the evolution and dynamics of different stellar populations near mbhs , processes in which mass segregation processes play a key role ( see ( keshet * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xcite for a detailed treatment of mass segregation near mbhs ) .",
    "mass segregation occurs through two - body interactions between less massive and more massive objects .",
    "the encounters drive stellar populations of different masses towards energy equipartition which results in the more massive objects migrating closer to the center , while the less massive ones migrate outwards . in particular , mass segregation can increase the density of the more massive cos within the region @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the maximal semi - major axis at which a co could still inspiral and become an elisa source ( hereafter the critical separation ) , rather than plunge - in on a too radial orbit and spending too short time in the gw detector band and unlikely to be detected .",
    "@xcite derived an analytical order - of - magnitude estimate for the critical separation , given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the radius of influence ( see section 3 ) , @xmath4 is a length scale and @xmath5 is the power law of the distribution function ( @xmath6 , see section 3 and @xcite ) .",
    "the event rate of emris has been estimated by several studies ( e.g. @xcite ) but remains rather uncertain , in part because of the slow nature of the inspiral process , which occurs on many dynamical times ( see further discussion by @xcite ) .",
    "previous studies of emri rates in nscs typically considered only populations of single - mass sbhs ( with mass @xmath7 m@xmath8 ) , however , theoretical studies , and the recent gw detection of a merger of two @xmath9 m , suggest a potentially wide range of sbh masses .",
    "the effect of such non - trivial sbh population on the rates of gws from merger of binary - sbh ( detectable by aligo ) was considered by @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the implications for a different type of gw sources , namely inspirals of cos on mbhs , producing emris .",
    "future emri detections could potentially probe the mass function ( mf ) of inspiralling sbhs .",
    "however , the mutual interactions between sbhs and stars of different masses could significantly alter their distributions near mbhs , and thereby the emri rate from sbhs of different masses .",
    "therefore , translating the emri mf into the original mf of sbhs requires understanding the non - trivial evolution and mass segregation processes in nscs .",
    "finally , we note that not only the mf of sbhs change their distribution , but potentially the star - formation history and build - up of the nsc ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this letter",
    ", we explore for the first time the expected mass - function of emris ( with the main focus on sbhs ) , and its relation and translation to the general mf of sbhs .",
    "furthermore , we consider both the rates from relaxed nscs , as well the role of the build - up and star - formation history in affecting the emri properties and rates .",
    "in relaxed nsc systems the distribution of different stellar populations can typically achieve a steady state .",
    "studies of simple stellar populations ( composed of 4 populations : solar mass main sequence ( ms ) stars , @xmath10 m@xmath8 nss , @xmath11 m@xmath8 wds and 10 m@xmath8 sbhs ) , using fokker - planck ( fp ; see also below ) , monte - carlo or n - body simulations showed them to distributed with power - law density profiles , generally consistent with analytic estimates of mass - segregation effects near mbh by @xcite .",
    "later studies @xcite pointed - out that the mass - segregation solution for the steady - state distribution of stars around a mbh has two branches : a weak - segregation solution ( described by @xcite ) and a different , strong - segregation solution .",
    "they found that their properties depends on the heavy - to - light stellar mass ratio @xmath12 and on the unbound population number ratio @xmath13 , through the relaxational coupling parameter @xmath14,\\label{eq : delta}\\ ] ] where systems with @xmath15 reside in the strong mass - segregation regime . in the strong mass - segregation regime",
    "the massive objects can achieve much stepper density profile compared with the @xcite weak mass - segregation regime .",
    "@xcite mainly focused on cases which can be generally divided between small population of massive objects ( @xmath16 m@xmath8 sbhs ) and large population of low - mass objects ( ms stars , nss and wds with @xmath17@xmath18 ) in the @xmath19 regime .",
    "however , a more complex situation arises when the high - mass population is composed of a range of masses .",
    "for example , in the case of two massive populations ( with @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the calculated @xmath22 parameter could be below unity when comparing each of the high - mass populations to the low - mass one , while @xmath22 could be above unity when comparing the two massive - stars populations ( i.e. treating @xmath23 as a low mass compared with @xmath24 ) .",
    "@xcite used analytic tools and generalized the derivation for such non - trivial mf cases .    using the above mentioned results , one can find the expected density profile ( @xmath25 ) , where @xmath26 then for a given population of stars with a given mass in a relaxed nsc , given by @xcite and @xcite :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the relevant population mass and @xmath29 is the weight average mass . for mass function",
    "not strongly dominated by light stars ( negligible flow ) the relation is linear : @xmath30 @xcite . in order to find the number of gw progenitors we then need to integrate the number of co gw progenitors ( i.e. inside the critical separation , @xmath1 : @xmath31 substituting eq . [ eq : critical_d ] then gives us the inspiral rate dependence on the the co mass per unit mass :    @xmath32    given the gw detector sensitivity on the inspiraling co mass , cos with @xmath33would be detected to distances larger by @xmath34 and taking a homogenous universe at sufficiently large distances one expects a @xmath35 enhancement in the detection rate .",
    "given an intrinsic mf of cos ( for simplicity assuming a power - law distribution ; @xmath36 ) , we can now combine all of the above eqs together and relate the co intrinsic mf to the mf of detected emris :    @xmath37    where the last integral can be numerically solved . given sufficient number of emri detection",
    "one can use these relation to derive the intrinsic mf of sbh .",
    "in order to test the analytic results we use a fp approach . our model is based on the classic approach of @xcite and @xcite to the problem , and use our parallelized fp code ( as described in @xcite ) .",
    "we simulate the evolution in time , @xmath38 of the energy , @xmath39 distribution function ( df ) - @xmath40 and the number density of stars in a spherical system around a mbh .",
    "the df represents the distribution of stars in central few pcs , and in particular in the range between the schwarzschild radius and the radius of influence . to our original code",
    "we now added the treatment of multi - mass cases , following the same equations as described in @xcite and @xcite .    in the following , we briefly recapitulate the main assumptions and discuss our treatment of gw capture .",
    "the fp model used consists of a time and and energy - dependent , angular momentum - averaged particle conservation equation .",
    "it has the form :    @xmath41    where @xmath42    the term @xmath43 $ ] is related to the stellar flow , and plays an important role in the evolution of the stellar cluster .",
    "it presents the flow of stars in energy space due to two - body relaxation , it is defined by :    @xmath44    we note that similar to @xcite work , we neglect here the effect of resonant relaxation ( rr ; @xcite;@xcite ) , which was suggested to increase the emri rate by up to an order of magnitude ( @xcite and @xcite . however , more recent analysis of ( @xcite , who also considered merritt work , bar - or , private communication ) , suggest a relatively negligible effect , supporting our approach on this issue .",
    "we followed the evolution of several types of nscs with a mbh mass of @xmath45 which can be a representative of a typical elisa sources .",
    "we first studied primordial nscs which achieved a steady state , and did not experience any star formation ( sf ) .",
    "such models correspond to the same type of models considered previously ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , besides the difference in stellar population used ( see next section ; we also recalculated the same models used by @xcite , and verified we get the same results in this case ) .    for the model with sf we tested two cases : inner sf formation in the range @xmath46 and outer sf between @xmath47 .",
    "for each of these two cases we considered two different scenarios of formation and evolution : 1 ) in situ formation of ms stars and cos .",
    "2 ) an initial pre - existing cusp of ms+co stars evolved with continuous sf ms+co stars ( see table [ tab : nsc - moder - and_gw ] ) . in the latter scenario ,",
    "we define the initial ms df within @xmath3 in the form of @xmath48 corresponding to the bw steady - state cusp which has the form of @xmath49 .",
    "the density profile at @xmath3 is normalized to @xmath50 , corresponding to number density at @xmath3 in the galactic center ( gc ) assuming a mean mass of @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "we also adopt the following parameters taken from the gc values : @xmath52 and @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "we consider the df at @xmath54 to have a maxwellian distribution : @xmath55 @xcite .    in order to account for sf , following our previous work in @xcite , we added the source term that represents the stars and co formation in the form :    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is a rectangular function , which boundaries correspond to the region where new stars are assumed to from ; @xmath58 is the source term amplitude ; and @xmath59 is a power - law function with a slope @xmath60 , defining the sf distribution in phase space .",
    "similar to @xcite we consider four basic populations .",
    "the first consists of ms stars , assumed here to be of solar mass .",
    "mss do not contribute to the gw inspiral rate since they are tidally disrupted before spiraling in , but they do contribute dynamically .",
    "the other populations represent wds ( @xmath61 ) , nss ( @xmath62 ) , and sbhs .",
    "we considered cases which include stellar populations of @xmath63 @xmath64sbhs ( similar to previous studies ) , but also considered cases with both @xmath63 @xmath64 and @xmath65 @xmath64sbhs , in order to probe the effect of more than a single type of massive objects .",
    "considering @xcite work , we used the fraction ratios of the four populations as @xmath66 , typical for continuously star - forming populations .",
    "the mf of sbhs is not well understood , however for sbhs up to @xmath67 @xmath64 theoretical models of direct collapse suggest an almost linear relation between progenitor mass and final sbh mass @xcite , and we therefore assume an sbh mf which goes like @xmath68 close to the initial mf of massive stars ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "we followed the evolution of the studied nscs for 10gyr corresponding to hubble timescale .",
    "note that this timescale is also comparable with the relaxation time for a gc - like nsc , but likely lower that the relaxation time for nscs hosting more massive mbh .",
    "we present the density profile of the studied scenarios in figs [ fig:3 basic densities ] , and [ outer_inner_sf_higher_lower ] , where we focus the central @xmath70 region to predict the gw rates ( @xmath71 for wds and nss ) .",
    "we integrate the density profile in the mentioned region and obtain the number and derive the rates of inspiralling co. we summarize our results in table [ tab : nsc - moder - and_gw ] . for comparison we obtained results from simulations similar to those of @xcite ( 2006 ; fig .",
    "[ fig:3 basic densities ] ; i.e. a steady state nsc with no sf ) .",
    "as expected from the effects of strong mass - segregation the density profile of the sbhs in most scenario is much steeper than the @xmath72solar mass ms / co stars .",
    "consequently , the rates of emri of sbhs is the highest compared with nss and wds . in the inner regions of the nsc , sbhs can become the most frequent stellar species , where the exact region where the dominate depends on the specific model explored .",
    "the distribution of the @xmath73 sbhs in nscs that include @xmath74 sbhs is very similar to the ns distribution , where in nscs without @xmath74 sbhs , the distribution of @xmath73 has the steeper slope compared to the other populations . in other words , in the absence of @xmath74 sbhs , the @xmath73 sbhs distribution is border - line between the weak and strong mass - segregation regimes .",
    "the existence of the @xmath74 population quenches the effects of strong mass - segregation on the @xmath73 , and only the @xmath74 sbhs are strongly segregated .",
    "the obtained slope of the @xmath73 sbh number density in the outer - sf scenario is @xmath75 , where in the scenario that includes the @xmath74 sbhs it decreases to @xmath76 , and the slope of the more massive sbhs is @xmath77 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3 basic densities ] ) . the highest slope ( @xmath78 )",
    "is obtained for the @xmath74 sbh population in nscs , evolved from pre - existing stellar cusp , that experience inner - sf .",
    "the slopes calculated in our numerical simulations are consistent with the analytical study of @xcite .",
    "analytic derivation of the rates presented in section 2 , and found comparable results .      following the obtained nsc stellar distribution , we integrated the number of cos up to the critical separation in order to quantify the number of expected emris .",
    "we summarize the results in table [ tab : nsc - moder - and_gw ] .",
    "the highest emris are obtained in nscs that evolve from a pre - existing cusp that also experiences strong sf in the outer region .",
    "the lowest overall rates are obtained with inner - sf that builds up the nsc . for comparison with previous studies , the last row in the table",
    "is based on @xcite as described in [ sub : distribution - of - compact ] .     & @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) & @xmath81 ( @xmath80 ) & @xmath82 ( @xmath80 ) & @xmath83 ( @xmath80 )   +   & & 14 & 79 & 232 & - +   & & 11 & 71 & 92 & 265 +   & & 15 & 73 & 87 & 252 +   & & 7 & 22 & 58 & 273 +   & & 39 & 62 & 74 & 312 +   & & 32 & 112 & 62 & 288 +   & & 45 & 68 & 85 & 301 +   & & 8 & 67 & 15 & 97 +   & - & 7 & 73 & 89 & 273 +   & - & 6 & 33 & 252 & - +",
    "in this work we studied the rates of gws from extreme - mass ratio inspirals , but considered two novel aspects which were little , or not considered before in this context .",
    "we study ( 1 ) the impact of a wide mass - spectrum sbhs ( as suggested by theoretical work and the recent detections of high mass sbhs by aligo ; @xcite ) on emri rates , and ( 2 ) the role of in - situ formation of stars and cos during the build - up and/or formation of nuclear stellar clusters .      1 .   we find that strong mass - segregation produces a steep power - law density profile for the most massive sbhs , but at the same time quenches the migration of less massive sbhs close to the mbh .",
    "we quantify this effect and provide a translation between the intrinsic mass function of co , in particular sbhs , and the ( future ) observable mass function of the emri gw sources , showing the latter to be strongly biased towards high mass cos .",
    "we find that sf plays a relatively small role in eventually determining the emri rates for sbhs ( and its mass function ) , since most of them migrate close to the mbh through mass - segregation rather than form in - situ .",
    "however , the rate of emri of neutron stars can be significantly increased when they form in - situ close to the mbh . in this latter case",
    "neutron stars can inspiral before relaxation processes significantly segregates them outwards farther away from the mbh .",
    "a reverse but weaker effect of decreasing the emri rates from neutron stars and white dwarfs occurs when star - formation proceeds far from the mbh . in this case",
    "the mass segregation processes due to the sbhs somewhat quench the newly formed nss / wds from diffusing into the inner regions , and lower their emri rates .",
