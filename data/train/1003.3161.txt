    "based on these observations , several theories draw analogies between the glass transition and phase transitions that occur in model systems  @xcite . however , experimental glass transitions are not thermodynamic phase transitions , since responses to thermodynamic fields such as temperature or pressure are never observed to diverge . on the other hand ,",
    "models of glass - forming liquids have been shown to exhibit a dynamical phase transition , which is controlled not just by temperature , but also by a biasing field that moves the system away from equilibrium  @xcite . here",
    ", we demonstrate the existence of a non - trivial critical point associated with this transition .    the phase transition that we consider occurs in trajectory space .",
    "we bias the system towards an ` ideal glass ' phase by enhancing the probability of trajectories where particle motion is slow .",
    "the parameter that controls this bias  the field @xmath2  can be varied continuously in computer simulations . for models of glass - forming liquids ,",
    "the response to this change can be large and discontinuous , corresponding to a first - order phase transition .",
    "such transitions between an ergodic ( fluid ) state and a non - ergodic ( glass ) state were first demonstrated  @xcite for kinetically - constrained lattice models ( kcms )  @xcite .",
    "more recently , evidence for such a transition has been found in the molecular dynamics of an atomistic model of a supercooled liquid  @xcite .    in kcms",
    ", the transition to the inactive phase takes place when the biasing field @xmath2 is infinitesimally small , and this result is independent of the temperature .",
    "however , very general arguments based on ergodicity breaking ( see , for example , refs .",

    "firstly , we prove that the dynamic phase transition found in the original fa model still occurs when the constraint forces are finite , but the transition now takes place at non - zero @xmath2 .",
    "this result means that the sfa model  a system with finite short - ranged forces of interaction , one that exhibits long relaxation times and dynamic heterogeneity without equilibrium thermodynamic transitions of mode - coupling theory  @xcite and random first - order theory  @xcite  has a dynamical non - equilibrium glass transition .",
    "the solution of the sfa model is therefore a concrete , if overly simplified , illustration of the picture of the glass transition proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite and later supported by the results of refs .",
    "we believe that this is the first study to demonstrates all of these features in a single model .",
    "our second main result is that the sfa model supports a new finite - temperature critical point that only appears when the constraints are softened .",
    "more specifically , we show that the first - order dynamical phase boundary in the sfa model ends at a critical point , with universal scaling behavior that maps to that of a quantum - ising model in a transverse field  @xcite , and hence to a classical liquid - vapor ( or liquid - liquid ) critical point .",
    "the existence of such a critical point is consistent with the requirement that models of glass - formers should recover simple liquid behavior at high temperatures .",
