    "the study of solutions of the yang - mills ( ym ) theory in a curved spacetime geometry can be traced back at least to the early work @xcite . among other results ,",
    "that study has given an exact solution of the ym equations in a fixed schwarzschild black hole background .",
    "this shows that the non - trivial solutions to the full system of einstein  yang - mills ( eym ) equations are likely to exist , at least for large enough event horizon black hole radius .",
    "indeed , this has been confirmed ten years later , when several different authors have constructed asymptotically flat , black hole ( bh ) solutions within the framework of @xmath4 su(2 ) eym theory @xcite .",
    "although these bhs were static and spherically symmetric , with vanishing ym charges , they were different from the schwarzschild one and , therefore , not characterized exclusively by their total mass .",
    "unfortunately , soon after their discovery , it has been shown that these solutions are unstable @xcite , @xcite . however , despite this fact , they still present a challenge to the standard _ no hair conjecture _ @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these results have led to a revision of some of the basic concepts of bh physics based on the uniqueness and no - hair theorems .",
    "for example , the israels theorem does not generalize to the non - abelian ( na ) case , since static eym black holes with non - degenerate horizon turn out to be not necessarily spherically symmetric @xcite .",
    "moreover , in strong contrast to the abelian case , the eym hairy black holes in @xcite do not trivialize in the limit of a vanishing horizon area , reducing to horizonless , globally regular , particle - like configurations , originally found by bartnik and mckinnon in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as a result",
    ", the subject of particle - like and hairy bh solutions in eym theory has become an active field of research , with many new results being reported each year .",
    "one interesting question addressed in this context is what happens if one drops the assumption of asymptotic flatness for the spacetime background .",
    "the case of the eym system with a negative cosmological constant @xmath5 is of particular interest , the natural background of the theory corresponding to anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime .",
    "solutions of various physical models in this geometry received recently much interest due to the conjectured anti - de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence .",
    "this is a concrete realization of the holographic principle , which asserts that a consistent theory of quantum gravity in @xmath6-dimensions must have an alternate formulation in terms of a nongravitational theory in @xmath7-dimensions .",
    "despite the fact that string theory in ads space is still too complicated to be dealt with in detail , in many interesting cases , it is sufficient to consider the low energy limit of the superstring theory , namely , supergravity .",
    "however , the gauged supergravity theories generically contain ym fields ( although most of the studies in the literature have been restricted to the case of abelian matter content in the bulk ) , and thus the interest in the study of the eym system with @xmath8 .",
    "the first result on na fields in a globally ads@xmath9 geometry can be found again in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a non - trivial solution of the ym equations is exhibited in closed form ) . ] .",
    "this solution describes a globally regular , finite energy soliton , with a nonzero magnetic flux at infinity ( despite the absence of a higgs field ) , anticipating most of the basic properties of the ( gravitating ) na fields in an ads background .",
    "the study of eym solutions in a globally ads@xmath9 background have started with refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , where spherically symmetric bhs and solitons have been studied , again for the gauge group su(2 ) .",
    "as shown there , a variety of well known features of asymptotically flat self - gravitating nonabelian solutions are not shared by their ads counterparts .",
    "restricting for simplicity to purely magnetic configurations , one finds a continuum of particle - like and bh solutions describing na monopoles with a non - integer magnetic charge ( we recall that the asymptotically flat eym configurations are magnetically neutral , forming a discrete sequence indexed by the node number of the magnetic gauge potential @xcite )",
    ". moreover , perhaps most remarkable , some of the solutions are stable against spherically symmetric linear perturbations @xcite , @xcite .",
    "also , as already found in ref .",
    "@xcite , the curved background geometry provided an extra attracting force , which makes possible the existence of finite mass , particle - like ym solutions already in the probe limit , @xmath10 in a fixed ads spacetime .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , @xcite the soliton and black hole solutions in @xcite , @xcite possess interesting generalizations with higher gauge groups .",
    "a review of the eym solutions in a globally ads@xmath9 background can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we note that an even more intricate picture is found when studying eym topological bhs @xcite .",
    "for example , no globally regular particle - like limit of the solutions is found in this case . moreover , as discovered in @xcite , @xcite , the planar hairy bhs describe gravity duals of @xmath11wave superconductors . as a result , this type of eym solutions enjoyed recently much interest . also , the @xmath12 configurations possess higher dimensional generalizations @xcite , with the @xmath13 eym planar black holes describing holographic @xmath11wave superfluids @xcite . however , these aspects are beyond the purposes of this paper , where we shall restrict ourselves to the case of the su(2 ) gauge fields and the asymptotically ads@xmath9 spacetime .",
    "one should remark that , even in the case of the global ads spacetime , the study of ym solutions is still far from being complete .",
    "for example , very few things are known about non - spherically symmetric eym - ads solutions .",
    "non - abelian solitons which are axially symmetric only have been studied in ref .",
    "these configurations possess an azimuthal winding number @xmath14 and describe ( non - topological ) monopoles localized at the origin , sharing all basic properties of the spherically symmetric counterparts ( which have @xmath15 ) .",
    "also , despite the generic presence of a net magnetic flux , they can be viewed as the natural ads generalizations of the asymptotically flat eym solitons in @xcite . however , as discussed in @xcite , the eym system with @xmath16 possesses a variety of other globally regular solutions , describing _ composite configurations _ , with several constituents . in the notation of @xcite ,",
    "these solutions are characterized by a pair of positive integers @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is related to the polar angle and @xmath2 to the azimuthal angle .",
    "one should remark that the ads solutions discussed so far in the literature cover the case @xmath17 only , that is , solutions with a single center .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to explicitly construct ads @xmath18 configurations with @xmath19 , looking for new features induced by the different asymptotic structure of the spacetime .",
    "although some common features are present , the results we find for @xmath8 are rather different from those valid in the asymptotically flat case .",
    "perhaps the most prominent new result is the existence of multi - center solutions with a net magnetic flux at infinity , despite the absence of a higgs field ( such solutions are absent for @xmath16 ) .",
    "similar to the spherically symmetric case @xcite , such na configurations exist already in the probe limit ( @xmath10 no backrection ) .",
    "moreover , when including the gravity effects , we establish the absence , for large enough values of @xmath20 , of configurations with a zero magnetic flux ( which are the only ones existing in the asymptotically flat case ) .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in the next section we introduce the gauge field ansatz and address the question of possible asymptotics for ( purely magnetic ) static , axially symmetric ym fields . in section 3",
    "we construct solutions with these asymptotics in the probe limit , @xmath10 for a fixed ads background .",
    "although being relatively simple , nevertheless this case appears to contain all the essential features of the gravitating solutions .",
    "the backreaction of the solutions on the spacetime geometry is considered in section 4 . there",
    "special attention is paid to a particular value of @xmath5 , for which the eym system becomes a consistent truncation of the @xmath12 , @xmath21 gauged supergravity @xcite ; therefore such solutions can be uplifted to @xmath22 dimensions @xcite .",
    "when we abandon this restriction , the variation of the gravitational coupling constant @xmath3 ( which is the ratio between the planck length and ads length scales ) reveals the existence of two branches of gravitating solutions which bifurcate at some critical value @xmath23 .",
    "these branches interpolate between the solutions in the global ads spacetime and , for small values of the coupling constant on the upper branches , the generalized bartnik - mckinnon solutions in the asymptotically flat spacetime @xcite , confined in the interior region , and outer configurations in the global ads spacetime .",
    "we give our conclusions and remarks in the final section . the appendix a contains a derivation of an exact solution of the eym equations with negative cosmological constant as a perturbation around the globally ads vacuum state .",

    "the usual spherically symmetric magnetic ( singularity - free ) ym ansatz is recovered .",
    "this ansatz is axially symmetric in the sense that a rotation around the @xmath51axis ( with @xmath52 ) can be compensated by a suitable gauge transformation @xcite .",
    "however , note that the gauge transformation @xmath53 leaves the ansatz form - invariant @xcite . thus , to construct regular solutions we have to fix the gauge .",

    "a possible gauge invariant definition of @xmath63 which we shall employ in this work , is @xcite @xmath64 we have verified that in the spherically symmetric case , ( [ qm ] ) agrees , up to a sign , with the magnetic charged expression in @xcite .",
    "we close this part by noticing that the static axially symmetric ym configurations in a fixed ads spacetime satisfy the virial identity of the effective action @xmath65 of the model ( which essentially coincides with ( [ mass ] ) ) , for a given set of boundary conditions",
    ". then @xmath65 must have a critical point at @xmath66 , which results in the virial relation ( [ virial ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath67 this makes clear that the ads geometry supplies the attractive force needed to balance the repulsive force of yang - mills gauge interactions .",
    "let us start with the more familiar case of gauge fields in a minkowski spacetime background .",
    "for @xmath16 , a systematic study of axially symmetric ym - higgs configurations has revealed the existence of two possible types of asymptotics of the ym fields , describing different ground states of the model .",
    "these asymptotics are indexed by a number @xmath1 , which is a positive integer .    * odd-@xmath1 conditions * for @xmath1 an odd number , @xmath68 , the ym fields possess a solution with @xmath69 which describe an infinite energy embedded abelian configuration with a singular origin .",
    "the configurations with these far field asymptotics carry a nonzero magnetic charge , @xmath70 ( with @xmath63 computed according to ( [ qm ] ) ) .",

    "( or they are just embedded abelian singular solutions ) . indeed , as discussed in @xcite , the yang - mills - higgs ( ymh ) system possesses regular , finite energy solutions whose gauge potentials approach ( [ odd - k - flat ] ) in the far field .",

    "one can see this in figures 5 , 6 for the spectrum of the @xmath156 solutions .",
    "there we plot the mass of the solitons in terms of the parameter @xmath118 which enters the far field asymptotics ( [ odd - k - ads ] ) and ( [ even - k - new ] ) ( we recall that @xmath118 fixes the magnetic charge of solutions via @xmath157 for odd @xmath1 , and @xmath158 for even @xmath1 ) .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the @xmath159 picture ( as shown in figures 5 , 6 ) , resembles the behaviour of non - gravitating q - balls , whose frequency - mass diagram exhibits a similar pattern , see @xmath160 @xcite .",

    "this property is shown in figure 6 for @xmath167 . to illustrate this behaviour",
    ", we also exhibit in figure 7 the energy isosurfaces of the @xmath168 configurations at @xmath169 and the fixed value of the energy density @xmath170",
    ".    one can understand this pattern as a manifestation of the composite structure of the @xmath165 configurations .",
    "indeed , from figure 7 we can clearly see that a typical @xmath168 solution consists of three constituents , each of them representing a @xmath76 soliton .",
    "similarly , a @xmath171 configuration consists of two @xmath76 components . since each of the @xmath76 components of the composite configuration possesses a magnetic dipole moment @xcite , whose magnitude increases with @xmath2 , the energy of the dipole - dipole interaction between the components becomes a significant part of the total energy .",
    "however this interaction energy can be both repulsive and attractive , depending on the orientation of the dipoles .",

    "this branch bifurcates with the upper branch which , once again , extends all the way back to the limit of vanishing coupling constant where it approaches the corresponding generalized bartnik - mckinnon solution .",
    "the difference to the eym solitons in ads spacetime is that in the eymh model the evolution along the upper branch is related with the decrease of the expectation value of the higgs field while in the former case it is related with the decrease of @xmath20 .",
    "the purpose of this work was to extend the spectrum of known na solutions in an ads background by reporting a whole new class of solitons indexed by two integers @xmath143 and a continuous parameter @xmath118 , which fixes the magnetic charge of the solutions .",
    "the main motivation for this task comes from the observation that the eym action ( [ model - eym ] ) enters the @xmath4 gauged supergravities as the basic building block and one can expect the basic features of its solutions to be generic .",
    "our solutions are akin to the asymptotically flat static , axially symmetric eym configurations studied in @xcite .",
    "however , we have found that new features occur due to the different asymptotic structure of the spacetime .",
    "the most prominent one is perhaps the existence in this case of a set of non - gravitating ym solutions which , for @xmath16 , are forbidden in the absence of a higgs field ( the odd-@xmath1 configurations , in the conventions of this work ) .",
    "also , the generic solutions possess a nonvanishing magnetic flux on the sphere at infinity , being interpreted as non - topological monopoles .",
    "new features occur also when including the backreaction of the ym fields on the spacetime geometry . a rather unexpected result there is the absence , for large enough values of @xmath20 , of magnetically neutral configurations . in particular , all solutions we have found for the case of main interest , corresponding to a consistent truncation of @xmath21 so(4 ) gauged supergravity , carry a non - zero magnetic charge .",
    "another interesting result is the existence of balanced , regular composite configurations , with several distinct components . to our knowledge , this is the first example in the literature of ads@xmath9 solutions with this property generalization of the israel - khan multi - black hole solution @xcite has not been found yet ( however , these configurations would possess conical singularities for @xmath8 as well ) .",
    "moreover , the majumdar - papapetrou @xcite , @xcite einstein - maxwell extremal black holes are also not known for a global ads background ( interestingly , such solutions exist for @xmath330 @xcite , @xcite ) . ] .",
    "one question we did not address concerns the stability of the new solutions .",
    "however , it is known that some ( @xmath331 , @xmath15 ) eym solitons are stable , and there is all reason to believe , that at least some of the the new @xmath0 configurations are also stable .    there are various possible extensions of the solutions discussed in this work .",
    "first , our preliminary results indicate the existence of static axially symmetric black hole solutions with na hair .",
    "these solutions are found within the same ym ansatz ( [ gauge - ansatz ] ) , and the same boundary conditions at infinity , by using again the edt approach .",
    "however , all configurations we have constructed so far possess a single horizon of spherical topology . finding",
    "asymptotically ads@xmath9 multi - black hole solutions remains a challenge that @xmath160 a composite eym configuration with two solitons located symmetrically on the @xmath332-axis would lead to a balanced dihole , when adding a small black hole at the center of each soliton . ] .",
    "another possible direction would be to generalize these configurations by including an electric potential for the ym connections .",
    "these axially symmetric solitons would carry automatically a nonzero electric charge and a non - vanishing angular momentum density .    finally , perhaps the most interesting task would be to generalize the solutions in this work for a poincar patch of the ads spacetime . in this case , all known solutions are just counterparts of the simplest @xmath333 spherically symmetric configurations in a globally ads background .",
    "we expect at least the @xmath17 configurations to possess planar generalizations with an azimuthal winding number @xmath14 .",
    "we hope to report elsewhere on these problems .    *  acknowledgements.  * we acknowledge support by the dfg research training group 1620 models of gravity. e.r .",
    "gratefully acknowledges support from the fct - if programme and ya.s .",
    "support by the a.  von humboldt foundation in the framework of the institutes linkage programm .",
    "the ads generalizations of the @xmath16 bartnik - mckinnon configurations have been constructed in @xcite by bjoraker and hosotani . in such a study , it is convenient to employ schwarzschild - like coordinates , with a metric ansatz : @xmath334 where @xmath335 @xmath336 corresponding to the local mass - energy density .",
    "the corresponding yang - mills ansatz is a truncation of ( [ gauge - ansatz ] ) , with @xmath15 and @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "the solutions with a regular origin have the following behaviour at @xmath162 @xmath338 where @xmath339 are real constants .",
    "the corresponding expansion at large @xmath45 reads @xmath340 where @xmath118 , @xmath57 and @xmath341 are constants determined by numerical calculations .",
    "@xmath57 corresponds to the adm mass of the solutions , while @xmath118 determines the value of the magnetic charge , @xmath342 .",
    "the numerical solutions are found by varying the parameter @xmath343 which enters the expansion at the origin ( [ origin1 ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath343 takes both positive and negative values , with @xmath344 corresponding to the ground ( vacuum ) state @xmath345    in this way a continuum of monopole configurations is found , which are regular in the entire space . in particular",
    ", one finds solutions also for small @xmath346 , which are arbitrarily close to the vacuum state ( @xmath10 , @xmath324 close to one everywhere ) .",
    "this suggests to construct the configurations as a power series expansion around the vacuum state ( [ ground ] ) , @xmath347 with @xmath348 a small parameter . to our best knowledge , although very simple , this approach did not appear in the literature .",
    "+   +   the spectrum of spherically symmetric solutions as given by the numerics and by the analytical estimates .",
    "although one can extend the solution to higher orders , it was not possible to identify a general pattern can be related to @xmath343 entering the small-@xmath45 expansion ( [ origin1 ] ) , and also to @xmath118 which enters the asymptotics ( [ asympt ] ) . to second order , one finds @xmath350 and @xmath351 , respectively . ] , the expressions for the functions becoming increasingly complicated with increasing @xmath352 .    in figure 14",
    "we plot the spectrum of @xmath21 so(4 ) solutions as found by solving numerically the eym equations together with the analytical estimates found from ( [ ex - sol - n ] ) .",
    "one can see that , for small values of @xmath353 , ( [ ex - sol - n ] ) provides a reasonable approximation of the full numerical solutions .",
    "one may expect similar closed form solutions to exist for other values of @xmath354 as well .",
