    "an important type of `` universal '' ( process independent ) corrections relevant for complete electroweak 2-loop calculations of physical processes are the contributions from on - shell gauge boson self - energies which incorporate the relation between bare , @xmath0 and on - shell ( pole ) masses ( 2-loop renormalization constant in on - shell scheme ) .",
    "such calculations are important to scrutinize theoretical uncertainties which might obscure e.g. the indirect higgs mass bounds obtained by the lep experiments .",
    "most interesting are @xmath1 fermion processes , which in future eventually may be investigated with much higher precision at tesla in case the giga@xmath2  @xcite option would be realized . here , we outline the complete 2-loop sm calculation of the pole position of the massive gauge - boson propagators presented in  @xcite .",
    "the position of the pole @xmath3 and the wave - function renormalization constant @xmath4 of the propagator of a massive gauge - boson are defined by the relation @xmath5 for @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the transversal part of the one - particle irreducible self - energy and @xmath8 is the bare mass and we have adopted the standard parameterization of the pole @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the width of the unstable gauge - boson .",
    "this equation can be solved perturbatively , order by order .",
    "up to two loops the solution reads @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the bare or @xmath0",
    "-renormalized @xmath13-loop contribution to @xmath14 , the prime ( double prime ) denotes the derivative ( second derivative ) with respect to @xmath15 at @xmath16 .",
    "one of the remarkable properties of ( [ polemass ] ) is that the pole position is well - defined in terms of self - energy diagrams and its derivatives at momentum ( square ) equal to the bare or the @xmath0 mass ( square ) which , by construction , are real parameters .    for the @xmath2-boson the equation for the position of the pole is modified due to @xmath17 mixing @xmath18 the 2-loop wave - function renormalization constant in this case is equal to @xmath19 we would like to stress , that in order to obtain gauge invariant results the tadpole contributions have been included  @xcite .",
    "at the 2-loop level we have about 1000 1pi diagrams each for the @xmath2- and the @xmath20-propagator .",
    "our calculation is largely automatized : we use @xmath21  @xcite to generate the diagrams and then the c - program * diana *  @xcite to produce for each diagram the input suitable for our * form * packages .",
    "two - loop propagator type diagrams with several masses can be reduced to a restricted set of so - called master - integrals by using a complete set of recurrence relations given in  @xcite .",
    "we have used this approach only for the calculation of the 2-loop massless fermion corrections , where analytical results for the master - integrals are available  @xcite .",
    "as compared to the existing calculation of the massless fermion contribution , performed in  @xcite , we apply tarasov s recurrence relations  @xcite which allows us to reduce the number of master - integrals to a minimal set .",
    "the latter includes integrals which may be evaluated by using the package * on - shell2 *  @xcite plus the following new prototypes : ( using standard notation  @xcite ) +    * * @xmath22 : * +    @xmath23 +    * * @xmath24 : * +    @xmath25 + we have worked out an independent analytical calculation of these master integrals by using a method developed in  @xcite .",
    "one of the crucial points of our approach is the observation  @xcite that the analytical results for diagrams with two - massive cuts have a very simple form if written in terms of new variables . for diagrams with two equal internal masses @xmath26 and arbitrary external momentum @xmath15 the new variable is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 .",
    "when the external momentum belongs to one of the internal masses @xmath16 , the new variable is @xmath29 , where @xmath30 . to speed up the numerical evaluation of on - shell gauge - boson self - energies , an expansion in @xmath31",
    "may be used , which converges well and simplifies the results considerably .",
    "however , it is not a naive taylor expansion due to the presence of threshold singularities of the form @xmath32 .",
    "we therefore briefly outline the corresponding expansions for the relevant master - integrals by giving two examples .",
    "the integral @xmath33 $ ] depends on the small parameter @xmath34 via the variable ( see  @xcite ) @xmath35 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which we expand first and then substitute it into the analytical result in order to get the series expansion for @xmath36 .",
    "the integral @xmath37 $ ] depends on @xmath38 via the variable @xmath39   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and we proceed as in the previous case .",
    "however , in all other cases , the master - integrals which show up are not know analytically so far .",
    "they can be calculated numerically , by using one of the approaches and/or programs developed for the 2-loop self - energies  @xcite .",
    "the full list of master - integrals occurring in the 2-loop calculation of the pole - mass of the gauge - bosons ( for the photon propagator see  @xcite ) reads :    * * @xmath22 : * +    @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45    * * @xmath24 : * +    @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 + to keep control of gauge invariance we adopt the @xmath53 gauge with three different gauge parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 . in most cases exact analytic results in terms of known functions",
    "are not available .",
    "thus , instead of working with the exact formulae ( which only can be evaluated numerically , at present ) we resort to some approximations , namely , we perform appropriate series expansions in ( small ) mass ratios  @xcite . for diagrams with several different masses",
    "it is possible that several small parameters are available . in this case",
    "we apply different asymptotic expansions ( see  @xcite ) one after the other . specifically , we expand in the gauge parameters about @xmath56 , in @xmath57 and , for diagrams with higgs or / and top - quark lines , in @xmath58 or / and @xmath59 .",
    "numerical results are obtained using the packages * on - shell2 *  @xcite and * tlamm *  @xcite ( see  @xcite ) .    renormalizing the pole - mass at the 2-loop level requires to calculate the 1-loop renormalization constants for all physical parameters ( charge and masses ) , as well as the 2-loop mass - renormalization constant itself .",
    "not needed are the wave - function and ghost sector renormalizations .",
    "the full 2-loop relation between pole and @xmath0 parameters can be written in the form + @xmath60 \\pi_{v,0}^{(1 ) } , \\label{mct}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sum runs over all species of particles , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the 1-loop counter - terms for the charge and physical masses in the @xmath0 -scheme . the derivatives in ( [ mct ] )",
    "correspond to the subtraction of sub - divergencies .",
    "the genuine 2-loop mass counter - term is obtained by expanding @xmath63 in terms of the renormalized mass .    summing all 2-loop contributions we restore gauge invariance of the position of the complex pole before uv renormalization .",
    "after uv - renormalization the propagator pole is represented in terms of finite amplitudes .",
    "for explicite results we refer to  @xcite . for the numerical evaluation we were using the first six coefficients in the weak angle @xmath64 and in the mass ratios @xmath65 .",
    "we now consider the sm renormalization group ( rg ) equations .",
    "we will denote on - shell masses by capital @xmath66 and @xmath0 masses by lowercase @xmath67 .",
    "we adopt the following definitions for the rg functions : for all dimensionless coupling constants , like @xmath68 , the @xmath69-function is given by @xmath70 and for all mass parameters ( a mass or the higgs v.e.v .",
    "@xmath71 ) the anomalous dimension @xmath72 is given by @xmath73 using the fact that @xmath3 is rg - invariant : @xmath74 , we are able to calculate the anomalous dimension of the gauge bosons masses from our finite results . at the same time , a typical relation between bare- and @xmath0 -masses has the form + @xmath75    such that the rg functions may be calculated directly from the uv counter - terms @xmath76 , ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "in addition , the uv counter - terms satisfy relations connecting the higher order poles with the lower order ones :    @xmath78    in the sm it is interesting to compare the rg equations calculated in broken phase with the ones obtained in the unbroken phase",
    ". let us remind that at the tree - level the vacuum expectation value @xmath71 is given by @xmath79 , where @xmath26 and @xmath80 are the parameters of the symmetric scalar potential .",
    "the masses of the gauge - bosons are equal to @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "the fact that these relations are rg invariant on the level of the bare quantities implies the relations @xmath83 where the 2-loop rg functions @xmath84 have been calculated in the unbroken phase in  @xcite .",
    "we have verified in the @xmath0 scheme , that these relations are valid up to 2-loop order in the broken phase with the same rg functions .",
    "thus the rg equations for the @xmath0 masses in the broken theory can be written as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the top - quark yukawa coupling ( the other yukawa couplings are kept zero ) .",
    "the @xmath0 fermi constant @xmath87 satisfies the following rg equation @xmath88    the knowledge of the anomalous dimensions @xmath89 allow us to write expression for the pole positions @xmath90 with explicit factorization of the rg logarithms .",
    "what we get is @xmath91 where @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 \\gamma_v^{(1 ) }   \\ ; , \\\\ & & \\hspace{-5 mm } c_v^{(2,1 ) } = \\gamma_v^{(2 ) } + \\gamma_v^{(1)}\\gamma_a^{(1 ) } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{-5 mm } + \\frac{1}{m_v^2 } \\biggl [ 2 \\beta_g^{(1 ) } + \\sum_j \\gamma^{(1)}_{m_j } m_j^2   \\frac{\\partial } { \\partial m_j^2 } \\biggr ] x_{v,1 } \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "in contrast to qcd , @xmath97 and @xmath98 have non - polynomial structure in the massless coupling constants which originated from the tadpole contributions .",
    "@xmath99 has been calculated long time ago  @xcite and @xmath100 are our results which , for the numerical evaluation , we approximated by finite series .",
    "the functions @xmath101 we have represented in terms of @xmath0 parameters . we note that the amplitudes @xmath101 entering ( [ factor ] ) have no explicit @xmath102 dependence .",
    "our results reveal terms of unexpectedly high powers of the higgs and the top - quark masses in ( [ factor ] ) , arising from 2-loop corrections .",
    "in fact the purely bosonic diagrams yield @xmath103 terms and the @xmath104 quark - doublet ( @xmath105 ) contributes @xmath106 power corrections . at a first glance ,",
    "such terms contradict veltman s screening theorem  @xcite which states , that the l - loop higgs dependence of a physical observable is bounded by @xmath107 for large higgs masses .",
    "however , this theorem only applies to physical observables like cross sections and asymmetries .",
    "if we consider quantities like @xmath108 ( which is an observable in the on - shell scheme ) in the @xmath0 scheme the screening theorem does not hold in general . to illustrate this ,",
    "let us compare the 1-loop ew corrections to the fermi constant  @xcite in the on - shell and the @xmath0 scheme introduced in ( [ ms : muon ] ) is different from @xmath109 defined via a hybrid scheme ( couplings @xmath0 , masses on - shell ) in  @xcite . ] : @xmath110 so that @xmath111 + \\biggl[\\frac{\\sin^2 \\theta_w}{\\sin^2 \\theta_w } - 1 \\biggr ] + \\delta \\alpha \\ ; .\\ ] ] the 1-loop correction @xmath112 in the limit of a heavy higgs boson has a logarithmic higgs mass dependence only .",
    "in contrast , in the @xmath0 scheme , higher powers of the higgs mass are showing up , because @xmath113 contributes the term @xmath114 while all other corrections exhibit logarithmic behavior in the higgs mass , only does not show extra powers of the higgs mass since masses are kept on - shell . ] .",
    "our relation ( [ factor ] ) between parameters of two different schemes does _ not _ relate physical observable but it is very important for analysis of the uncertainties coming from higher order effects  @xcite . in particular , our estimations of the 2-loop boson contribution to @xmath108  @xcite is very close to the results of real calculations  @xcite .",
    "by an explicite 2-loop calculation we have shown that ( to this order ) : @xmath115 the position of the complex pole @xmath116 of a the gauge - boson ( @xmath117 ) propagator is a gauge invariant quantity after inclusion of the higgs tadpole contributions ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath118 the renormalized on - shell self - energies are infrared finite .",
    "this derives from the fact that within dimensional regularization , which allows to regularize uv and ir singularities by the same @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) parameter , the singular @xmath121 terms are absent after uv renormalization . @xmath122",
    "the inclusion of the tadpoles is important for the renormalization group invariance and for the gauge invariance of the parameter renormalizations .",
    "@xmath123 by our calculation we have proven that the @xmath0 renormalization scheme is self consistent and works properly in case of unstable particles . @xmath124",
    "our results for the 2-loop mass renormalization constants in the on - shell and the @xmath0 scheme can be applied in calculations of physical quantities in both of these schemes at the 2-loop level .",
    "examples of such calculations , where results of our paper  @xcite have been used , are the computations of the bosonic 2-loop contributions to the muon life - time presented in  @xcite .",
