    "the first cobaltite na@xmath10coo@xmath1 exhibiting large tep ( @xmath11 100 @xmath9v / k at room temperature ) as well as low electrical resistivity was discovered by terasaki _",
    "et al . _ in 1997 @xcite . since then , the misfit cobaltites have also been thought to be the potential candidates for thermoelectric applications .",
    "the crystal structure of the misfit cobaltites consists of alternatively stacking three ( @xmath8=3 , such as [ ca@xmath1coo@xmath12@xmath5[coo@xmath1]@xmath13 ) or four ( @xmath8=4 , such as namely [ @xmath14bi@xmath1o@xmath4@xmath5[coo@xmath1]@xmath15 , @xmath16=ca , sr , ba ) rs - type layers and one coo@xmath1 hexagonal cdi@xmath1-type layer with edge - shared coo@xmath17 octahedra @xcite , which is similar to that found in na@xmath10coo@xmath1 . for simplicity , we take them as @xmath8=3 phase and @xmath8=4 phase , respectively .",
    "the two sublattices of rocksalt block and hexagonal @xmath18-type @xmath19 layer possess the common @xmath20- and @xmath21-axis lattice parameters and @xmath22 angles but different @xmath23-axis length causing a misfit along @xmath23-direction .",
    "among all the misfit cobaltites , tep varies from @xmath24 = 90 @xmath9v / k for [ sr@xmath1co@xmath25tl@xmath10o@xmath12@xmath5[coo@xmath1]@xmath26 up to @xmath24 = 165 @xmath9v / k for [ ca@xmath1co@xmath3pb@xmath27o@xmath12@xmath5[coo@xmath1]@xmath28 @xcite .",

    ", single crystals of bi - ca - co - o were grown by the flux method cooling from different melting temperatures .",

    "were systematically studied on these single crystals .",
    "the bi - ca - co - o single crystals were grown by the solution method using k@xmath1co@xmath39-kcl fluxes . in the first step , polycrystalline bi@xmath1ca@xmath1co@xmath1o@xmath40 was prepared by a solid - state reaction method .",
    "starting materials bi@xmath1o@xmath39 , caco@xmath39 and co@xmath39o@xmath41 were mixed in a proportion of bi : ca : co = 2:2:2 , with a total weigh to be 2.7 grams .",
    "the powders were heated at 800@xmath0 for 10 hours .",
    "then the prepared bi@xmath1ca@xmath1co@xmath1o@xmath40 and the mixture of kcl and k@xmath1co@xmath39 by a molar proportion of 1:4 ( 20.5 grams ) were mixed and loaded in an aluminum crucible having 30 ml volume .",
    "the solute concentration was about 1.5 mol@xmath42 .",
    "a lidded crucible was used to prevent the solution from evaporating and to grow crystals under stable conditions .",
    "the powder - flux mixture was melted at 900@xmath0 or 950@xmath0 for 20 hours , respectively , and then slowly cooled down to 600@xmath0 at a rate of 5 - 6@xmath0/hr .",
    "the single crystals were separated from the melt by washing with distilled water .",
    "the single crystals obtained with cooling from 900@xmath0 and 950@xmath0 were denoted as crystal 1 and crystal 2 in the following text , respectively .",
    "the crystals were large thin platelets and black in color , as shown in fig.1 .",
    "as shown in fig.1 , typical dimensions of the crystal 1 and crystal 2 are around 3@xmath433@xmath430.05 mm@xmath44 and 5@xmath435@xmath430.05 mm@xmath44 , respectively .",
    "the structural characterization of the single crystals was performed by x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) and transmission electron diffraction ( tem ) .",
    "the analysis of the actual composition was made by the inductively coupled plasma ( icp ) atomic emission spectroscopy ( aes ) ( icp - aes ) technique .",
    "resistivity was measured using a standard four probe method through an alternative current ( ac ) resistance bridge ( lr700 , linear research inc . ) .",
    "the tep was measured using the steady - state technique .",
    "the xrd patterns recorded for crystal 1 and crystal 2 are shown in fig .",
    "the presence of only 00@xmath45 reflections indicates that the crystals are grown along c - axis .",
    "the xrd pattern for crystal 1 grown from 900@xmath0 indicates good single @xmath8=4 phase .",
    "the @xmath21-axis lattice parameter was estimated to be 14.651 @xmath46 based on the d - spacing values of 00@xmath45 reflections .",
    "the icp - aes gave that the actual composition for crystal 1 is bi : ca : co = 1.40 : 2.00 : 2.29 . the xrd pattern for crystal 2 shows two sets of 00@xmath45 reflections . based on d - spacing values for the two sets of the reflections , the c - axis lattice parameters for the two sets of 00@xmath45 reflections are 14.659 @xmath47 and 10.800 @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "it suggests that there exist two phases in the crystal 2 .",
    "the 00@xmath45 reflections arises from the structure of the @xmath8=4 phase ( @xmath21 = 14.659 @xmath46 ) as the crystal 1 , while the set of 00@xmath45 reflections with c= 10.800 @xmath46 is the same as that observed in [ ca@xmath1coo@xmath12@xmath5[coo@xmath1]@xmath13 ( @xmath8=3 ) phase .",
    "therefore , it indicates that an intergrowth of the @xmath8=4 phase and [ ca@xmath1coo@xmath12@xmath5[coo@xmath1]@xmath13 ( @xmath8=3 ) phase occurs in crystal 2 .",
    "similar intergrowth has been reported in polycrystalline sr - bi - co - o system , where the major phase is @xmath8=3 layer - based cobaltite @xcite .",
    "the xrd pattern of crystal 2 shows that the dominated phase is @xmath8=4 .",
    "the icp - aes gave the actual composition for crystal 2 to be bi : ca : co = 1.40 : 2.37 : 2.77 .",
    "the electron diffraction ( ed ) patterns are shown in fig .",
    "3 for the crystal 1 and crystal 2 . in fig.3a",
    ", one can clearly see rs diffraction spots from the [ bi@xmath1ca@xmath1o@xmath4 layer and hexagonal diffraction spots from the [ coo@xmath1 ] layer for crystal 1 .",
    "the @xmath20- and @xmath23-axis length of the hexagonal [ coo@xmath1 ] layer ( @xmath48 , @xmath38 ) is estimated to be 2.87(9 ) and 2.83(2 ) @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath20- and @xmath23-axis length of the rs [ bi@xmath1ca@xmath1o@xmath4 layer ( @xmath50 , @xmath36 ) is estimated to be 4.98(9 ) ( @xmath51 ) and 4.784 @xmath49 , respectively . from the above structural analysis ,",
    "crystal 1 shows the misfit structure along @xmath23-axis ( @xmath52 = 1.69 ) ; while along @xmath20-axis , length of the rock - layer matches with that of the hexagonal layer ( @xmath53 ) , being consistent with previous report in polycrystalline sample @xcite .",
    "therefore , the structural formula of the crystal 1 can be written as [ ca@xmath1bi@xmath2co@xmath3o@xmath4@xmath5[coo@xmath1]@xmath7 .",
    "fig.3b shows similar main ed pattern for crystal 2 to that observed in crystal 1 shown in fig.3a .",
    "it gives the same in - plane lattice parameters of rs and hexagonal layers .",
    "in fig.3b , there are satellite reflections along @xmath54 direction , in contrast to the ed pattern for crystal 1 , which shows no satellite reflections as shown in fig.3a . because the xrd patterns of the two single crystals have shown that crystal 1 is pure @xmath8=4 phase ,",
    "while crystal 2 is intergrowth of @xmath8=4 and @xmath8=3 phases , therefore , the satellite reflections should come from the modulation structure in @xmath8=3 phase .",
    "superposition of the main reflections is consistent with almost the same in - plane lattice parameters between two compounds . actually , the misfit ratio ( 1.62 ) in [ ca@xmath1coo@xmath12@xmath5[coo@xmath1]@xmath13 is slightly smaller than that in crystal 1 .",
    "but if ca is partly substituted by bi in [ ca@xmath1coo@xmath12@xmath5[coo@xmath1]@xmath13 , the lattice parameter of the rs layer is enhanced and the same misfit ratio could be obtained as that in crystal 1 @xcite .",
    "the intergrowth of the @xmath8=3 and @xmath8=4 phases in bi - ca - co - o system arises from the thermodynamical competition for the two phases .",
    "pure single crystal of the @xmath8=4 phase can be grown with cooling the melting solution from 900@xmath0 , while single crystal intergrowth of @xmath8=3 and @xmath8=4 phases can be obtained with cooling the same melting solution from 950@xmath0 .",
    "it definitely indicates that the single crystal of @xmath8=3 phase can be grown only above 900@xmath0 .",
    "the melting solution was slowly cooled from 950@xmath0 , the single crystal of @xmath8=3 phase starts to grow . when the melting solution was cooled to below 900@xmath0 , the @xmath8=4 phase is thermodynamically more stable than the @xmath8=3 phase .",
    "therefore , the single crystal of @xmath8=4 phase begins to grow with the @xmath8=3 phase .",
    "in addition , the two phases have the same lattice parameters in plane , which provides a condition for the epitaxial intergrowth of the two phases .",
    "this is possible intergrowth mechanism for the @xmath8=3 and @xmath8=4 phases in bi - ca - co - o system .",
    "temperature dependence of the in - plane resistivity for crystal 1 and 2 is plotted in fig .",
    "the room - temperature values of @xmath55 are 12.7 m@xmath56 cm for crystal 1 and 13.6 m@xmath56 cm for crystal 2 , respectively .",
    "they are larger than those in [ ca@xmath1coo@xmath12@xmath5[coo@xmath1]@xmath13 ( 8.5 m@xmath56 ) and [ bi@xmath57sro@xmath1]@xmath58[coo@xmath1]@xmath59 ( 4.0 m@xmath56 ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath55 shows metallic behavior ( d@xmath31/d@xmath60 0 ) at high temperature and exhibits a minimum at 156 k and 206 k for crystal 1 and crystal 2 , respectively .",
    "these temperatures corresponding to the minimum of @xmath55 ( @xmath61 ) are much higher than those observed in [ ca@xmath1coo@xmath12@xmath5[coo@xmath1]@xmath13 ( 70 k ) and [ bi@xmath57sro@xmath1]@xmath58[coo@xmath1]@xmath59 ( 80 k ) single crystals @xcite . the room - temperature resistivity @xmath55 and the temperature corresponding to the minimum resistivity @xmath61 indicate that bi - ca - co - o system has the weaker metallicity compared to [ ca@xmath1coo@xmath12@xmath5[coo@xmath1]@xmath13 and [ bi@xmath57sro@xmath1]@xmath58[coo@xmath1]@xmath59 .",
    "5 shows that the insulator - like behavior at low temperature for the two types of crystal follows different transport laws .",
    "resistivity for crystal 1 below 150 k can be fitted using two thermal activation behavior ( @xmath62 $ ] , where @xmath63 is the energy gap ) , which gives the thermal activation energy ( @xmath63 ) to be 2.4 mev below 20 k and 4.3 mev between 25 k and 90 k. resistivity for crystal 2 can be fitted using thermal activation law above 40 k , with @xmath63=4.8 mev . below 40 k ,",
    "variable range hopping ( vrh , @xmath64 $ ] ) resistivity was observed .",
    "temperature dependence of the in - plane tep is shown in the fig.6 for crystal 1 and crystal 2 , as well as for [ ca@xmath1coo@xmath12@xmath5[coo@xmath1]@xmath13 crystal .",
    "@xcite the magnitudes of 180 @xmath9v / k for crystal 1 and 190 @xmath9v / k for crystal 2 are much larger than that observed in [ ca@xmath1coo@xmath12@xmath5[coo@xmath1]@xmath13 ( 125 @xmath9v / k ) and pb - doped [ bi@xmath57sro@xmath1]@xmath58[coo@xmath1]@xmath59 ( highest of 150 @xmath9v / k as x=0 ) @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the weaker metallicity in bi - ca - co - o system inferred by fig .",
    "the in - plane tep changes slightly at high temperature and decreases obviously below 100 k , similar to that observed in [ ca@xmath1coo@xmath12@xmath5[coo@xmath1]@xmath13 and [ bi@xmath57sro@xmath1]@xmath58[coo@xmath1]@xmath59 . a model for the tep in layered cobaltites has be proposed by koshibae @xcite .",

    "unchange in @xmath70 at room temperature for crystal 2 with intergrowth of @xmath8=3 and @xmath8=4 in bi - ca - co - o system can be ascribed to the simultaneous enhancement of tep and resistivity .",
    "the enhancement of the tep together with the resistivity due to intergrowth in bi - ca - co - co system is different from the case of the sr - based system @xcite , in which the intergrowth of @xmath8=3 and @xmath8=4 phase enhances the tep but reduces the resistivity relative to the pure @xmath8=3 phase .",
