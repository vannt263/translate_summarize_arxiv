    "in recent years bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) loaded into optical lattices have become an important tool in the studies of linear and nonlinear behavior of coherent waves in periodic systems .",
    "the band - gap structure of the matter - wave spectrum resulting from the periodicity of the optical trapping potential is responsible for much of the observed coherent behavior of the condensate , including bloch oscillations and landau - zener tunnelling  @xcite .",
    "one of the more dramatic effects of the lattice on the bec dynamics is the dependence of the group - velocity dispersion of matter waves on the curvature of the spectral band .",
    "the latter , in turn , is a function of the wavepacket quasi - momentum in the lattice rest frame . due to the possibility to create a moving optical lattice by varying the relative detuning of the interfering laser beams ,",
    "the condensate can be loaded into the lattice with a well - defined quasi - momentum @xcite .",
    "this enables precise engineering of the dispersion of the bec wavepackets in moving optical lattices  @xcite .",

    ", a localized bec wavepacket that maintains a constant spatial structure . the creation of a bright soliton in a _ repulsive _ condensate ( as opposed to an attractive condensate ) is _ only _ possible due to the negative effective dispersion at the edge of the first brillouin zone ( bz ) of a 1d optical lattice ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . driving the condensate from the middle to the edge of the brillouin zone achieves transition between the regimes of positive and negative effective dispersion .",
    "evolution of the matter wavepacket in the negative dispersion regime can result in the self - focusing of the repulsive bec in the form of a fundamental _ gap soliton _",
    "@xcite .",
    "the absolute value of the dispersion experienced by a bec wavepacket can be varied by changing the lattice depth  @xcite .",
    "all previous _ experimental _ studies on matter - wave dispersion management and gap solitons involved single - periodic _ shallow _ lattices  @xcite which are characterized by narrow spectral gaps , greater curvatures of the spectral bands , and hence larger values of the effective dispersion at the gap edges .",
    "stronger dispersion requires larger matter - wave nonlinearity , and hence larger atomic density , and/or wider wavepackets to achieve the localized state @xcite .",
    "therefore , dispersion manipulation in an optical lattice can potentially deliver control over the characteristics of bec solitons .    in this paper ,",
    "we explore novel possibilities to control the _ magnitude _ of dispersion experienced by a bec wavepacket _ at the edges of the spectral bands _ by modifying the shape of a double - periodic optical _ superlattice_. as known from the theory of diatomic lattices and semiconductor superlattices , an extra periodicity opens up additional narrow stop - gaps ( or mini - gaps ) in the band - gap spectrum . here",
    "we show that the values of effective dispersion at the edges of these mini - gaps can be varied within a much greater range than it is possible for a single - period lattice of a reasonable depth .",
    "to demonstrate the efficient dispersion control and generation of _ immobile _ gap solitons , we investigate the process of nonlinear localization in both moving and _ stationary _ superlattices . in the former case , in order to access the gap regions , the initially stationary condensate in the middle of the ground - state brillouin zone is driven to the band edge by accelerating the lattice . by the end of the _ adiabatic _ acceleration process , the condensate wavepacket has a quasi - momentum and an internal structure of a linear bloch wave at the gap edge . in this paper",
    ", we numerically simulate this process , starting from the initial adiabatic loading of the condensate into a quasi-1d superlattice .",
    "our numerical simulations closely follow the current experimental procedure for matter - wave gap - soliton generation  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we suggest a new method for creating the correct initial conditions for the soliton formation at the gap edge in a _ stationary _ lattice , by interfering two identical wavepackets with equal momenta of the opposite sign , corresponding to the opposite edges of the first bz .",
    "this enables us to efficiently create a matter wavepacket with the correct internal structure at the relevant gap edge and avoid large time scales associated with the adiabatic acceleration .",
    "such a wavepacket preparation technique was previously explored in optics  @xcite . here",

    "the group velocity @xmath61 vanishes at the band edges , hence the gap solitons form as immobile localized wavepackets .",
    "we note that formation and dynamics of gap solitons could be significantly modified in the case when the harmonic confinement in the longitudinal dimension becomes important @xcite . however , provided the longitudinal harmonic trapping is weak , the band structure imposed by the lattice is still well defined .",
    "moreover , in many experiments the longitudinal trapping potential is either sufficiently flat on the scale of hundreds of lattice wells , or is removed altogether after the condensate is loaded into an optical lattice @xcite .",
    "gap soliton formation can also occur in the minigaps of the superlattice spectrum .",
    "the size of the mini - gap increases with growing @xmath37 .",
    "this decreases the curvature in the band structure immediately surrounding the mini - gap , leading to a decrease in the magnitude of the effective dispersion at the gap edges .",
    "figure  [ figdvsep](b ) shows that simple variation of the relative depths of the two wells in the superlattice ( i.e. @xmath37 ) at a constant lattice height ( @xmath62 ) opens up access to a large range of effective dispersions at the edges of the mini - gap . as figure  [ figdvsep](a ) shows",

    "the size of the first mini - gap is equal to four single - photon recoil energies  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the single - particle adiabaticity condition for loading a stationary condensate into the lattice at @xmath65 is , @xmath74 .    in order to access the band edge ,",
    "a constant acceleration is introduced _ suddenly _",

    "if the acceleration , @xmath77 , is constant , a constant and uniform force is applied to the condensate  @xcite , which is somewhat analogous to the application of a constant homogeneous electric field to electrons in a crystal .",
    "the quasi - momentum of the condensate depends on the duration of the acceleration , @xmath78 , as @xmath79 , and in order to move the condensate to the band - edge ( @xmath80 ) , the recoil velocity @xmath81 of the lattice is reached with acceleration @xmath82 .",
    "the acceleration is adiabatic , i.e. the upper bands are not populated , provided the probability of transitions between the @xmath64 and @xmath69 bands are low .",
    "this requires a small magnitude of the acceleration , @xmath83  @xcite . for acceleration at a constant lattice height ,",
    "the critical energy gap is at the edge of the brillouin zone ( @xmath84 ) , where the gap is generally much smaller than that at @xmath65 , as can be seen in fig .",

    "this spatial structure allows sufficiently broad gap solitons to be described using a wave - envelope approximation with an appropriately chosen carrier wave , as described in the previous section .",
    "due to large differences between the ideal shape of the soliton and the shape of the initial wavepacket , significant oscillations in the shape of the wavepacket are observed [ see fig .",
    "[ figsinglewp](a ) ] .",
    "this is also a well known part of soliton formation in the absence of the lattice  @xcite .",
    "the closer the initial width of the wavepacket is to that of the soliton , the more efficient is the process of soliton generation .",
    "this is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ figsinglewp](d - f ) , where a slightly narrower initial wavepacket was used . as a general guide",

    "the acceleration process works best with a narrow momentum distribution and hence a wide wavepacket , which is broader than the soliton that is eventually formed .",
    "if the momentum distribution is too broad , undesirable effects may occur , e.g. the wavepacket can develop a strong asymmetry as it passes through the zero dispersion point , as described in ref .",
    "a wide initial wavepacket also reduces the maximum density in the initial wavepacket used to form a fundamental soliton since the width of the fundamental soliton s envelope near the band edge is inversely proportional to its amplitude , @xmath97  @xcite .    for both the ramping and acceleration processes",
    ", we have checked the momentum components of the wavepacket to ensure that there is no significant excitation of the upper bands . as discussed above",
    ", the rate at which the lattice can be adiabatically accelerated depends very strongly on the size of the energy gap .",
    "the size of the mini - gaps for superlattices with @xmath98 are much smaller than the size of the gaps of a single - periodic lattice for the same lattice height .",
    "this makes the above described techniques for condensate preparation at the edges of a superlattice mini - gap rather difficult to use due to the large acceleration times .",
    "difficulty in accelerating the condensate to the gap edge for narrow gaps produced in shallow single - periodic optical lattices was also noted in recent experiments  @xcite . however , smaller gaps are useful because they potentially enable greater values of the effective dispersion [ see fig .",
    "[ figdvsep](a ) ] .",
    "below , we study an alternative scheme for gap - soliton generation in a _ stationary _ lattice .",
    "since the problems of large time - scales associated with conditions of adiabatic ramping and acceleration are avoided in this case , the method would be equally useful for low modulation height single - periodic optical lattices and superlattices with narrow mini - gaps .",
    "an alternative method for creating a wavepacket with the correct quasi - momentum and internal structure to produce _ spatial gap solitons _ was first suggested theoretically in the context of nonlinear optics  @xcite , and was recently employed in experiments on weakly coupled waveguide arrays and optically - induced photonic lattices  @xcite . applied to matter waves in optical lattices , this technique means that , instead of using a moving lattice to gradually drag a bec wavepacket to the edge of the brillouin zone , we start with two non - stationary wavepackets with opposite momenta ( i.e. @xmath48 and @xmath99 ) corresponding to the bragg reflection condition in a _ stationary _ lattice .",
    "their interference produces a matter wave with the internal structure resembling that of the bloch wave at the gap edge .",
    "this is expected since the bloch wave at the edge of a gap is a periodic standing wave formed at the bragg reflection condition and hence can be presented as the superposition of identical forward and backward moving travelling waves . recently",
    "this method was used to theoretically demonstrate the formation of optical spatial gap solitons in binary waveguide arrays , the nonlinear optical analogue to our particular optical superlattice system  @xcite for a focusing ( attractive ) nonlinearity . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found that this method allows for the efficient production of spatial gap solitons at the top of the mini - gap .",
    "here we apply this method to _ repulsive _ condensates ( and hence the soliton formation at the _ bottom _ of the mini - gap ) .",
