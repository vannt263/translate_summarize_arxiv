    "the aim of this work is to present an efficient numerical approach , which is based on the finite difference method , to solve space fractional diffusion equations ( spfdes ) with non - smooth solutions .    in recent decades",
    ", anomalous diffusion has been widely considered in the investigation of transport dynamics in complex systems , such as underground environmental problem @xcite , fluid flow in porous materials @xcite , anomalous transport in biology @xcite , etc .",
    "spfdes can provide an adequate and accurate description of the super - diffusion process @xcite .    with the increasing application of spfde in modeling problems which exhibit super - diffusion , how to obtain its accurate numerical solution",
    "has attracted considerable attention .",
    "a great number of numerical methods have been developed in literature , among which the finite difference method is one of the most popular and powerful methods .",
    "a shifted grnwald formula for the riemann - liouville fractional derivative was firstly proposed in @xcite to solve the space fractional differential equations , which is of first - order accuracy and leads to unconditionally stable schemes .",
    "based on this work , some high - order finite difference schemes for spfde have been proposed subsequently , e.g. , the second - order extrapolation method @xcite , a class of weighted shifted grnwald formulas @xcite . as another popular scheme , the second - order fractional centered difference scheme was presented in @xcite to solve the equation with riesz fractional derivatives . in all aforementioned works",
    ", however , the convergence rates are obtained under the requirement of high regularity of the solution .",
    "though the assumption is natural for canonical partial differential equations with integer - order derivatives , it is too idealistic to satisfy for fractional differential equations ( fdes ) in application .",
    "in fact , the fractional derivatives are defined with weak singular kernel and the solution of fdes inherits the weak singularity .",
    "even smooth data can not ensure smoothness of the solution @xcite .",
    "in addition , the above - mentioned high - order schemes require that the solution and its first or even up to higher - order derivatives have vanishing values at the boundary . when solving fdes whose solutions have neither high regularity near the boundary nor vanishing derivatives at the boundary , the schemes based on these ideal assumptions will actually lead to numerical solutions of very low accuracy .    as to time - fractional initial value problems , for which the weak singularity of solutions usually exists at the origin",
    ", several approaches have been proposed to deal with the weak singularity in order to obtain numerical solutions of uniformly high - order accuracy , such as adopting adaptive grids ( nonuniform grids ) to keep errors small near the initial time @xcite , or employing non - polynomial basis functions to include the correct singularity index @xcite , or adding the correction terms to remedy the loss of accuracy and recover high - order schemes @xcite . as for space fractional boundary value problems / or initial boundary value problems ,",
    "the solutions generally have weak singularity near the boundary or the end - points of both sides in one - dimensional case .",
    "so far , to our knowledge , only a few works have been presented to numerical methods for spfdes with non - smooth solutions .",
    "zhao and deng @xcite derived finite difference schemes on non - uniform meshes to increase the accuracy for solving spfdes with non - smooth solution .",
    "jin and zhou @xcite proposed a singularity reconstruction strategy to enhance the convergence rate and gave a new finite element method for approximating boundary value problems with riemann - liouville fractional derivatives .",
    "mao and shen @xcite developed a spectral petrov - galerkin method for fdes with riesz fractional derivatives , in which the error estimate in non - uniformly weighted sobolev space shows that the errors decay exponentially even though the solution has singularities at the endpoints .",
    "the main contribution of this work is to present an improved algorithm based on finite difference methods , which is readily implemented , applicable to various kinds of finite difference schemes , and able to significantly enhance the accuracy of numerical solutions for spfdes with weak singularities . to deal with the singularity and obtain second - order accuracy , we first separate the solution @xmath0 of the considered problem into a regular / smooth part @xmath1 and a singular / non - smooth part @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the coefficient of the singular part .",
    "then we adopt extrapolation and posterior error correction techniques to approximate @xmath3 and recover the second - order accuracy of numerical solutions .",
    "compared to finite difference schemes on non - uniform meshes @xcite , the proposed algorithm holds the toeplitz - like structure of the finite difference schemes , which is a remarkable feature to allow low storage and the use of fast algorithms ; see @xcite .",
    "although the proposed algorithm will cause the extra cost , the increase of storage and computational cost is acceptable .",
    "numerical examples show that the improved wsgd and fcd schemes , which are obtained by applying the proposed algorithm to the wsgd and fcd schemes respectively , can produce more accurate numerical solutions than the corresponding original schemes without using the proposed algorithm ; see examples [ exm1]-[exm3 ] .",
    "even if the regularity of solution is unknown , that is , the  singular part \" of solution is given by the basic analysis of fdes and some conjectures , we can still obtain satisfactory accuracy ; see examples [ exm1]-[exm2 ] ( case ii ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we introduce some necessary definitions and notations .",
    "moreover , the wsgd scheme and the fcd scheme for spfdes are presented in this section . to derive the algorithm",
    ", we carry out the error estimate in maximum norm of the two schemes in section 3 .",
    "the main algorithm is derived in section 4 . in section 5 ,",
    "we give some numerical examples for solving fractional boundary value problems and spfdes with non - smooth solutions to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm .",
