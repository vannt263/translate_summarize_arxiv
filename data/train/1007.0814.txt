    "during the last years , many new and unexpected experimental data appeared on heavy hadron spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the study of spectroscopy and decays of heavy hadrons can give essential information on the quark structure of these hadrons , in particular of the properties of the cascade baryons @xcite .",
    "the impressive progress on the experimental physics stimulated comprehensive theoretical studies for understanding dynamics of heavy flavored hadrons at the hadronic scale .",
    "this scale belong to the non - perturbative sector of qcd and therefore for the calculations of different characteristics of the baryons , a non - perturbative approach is needed . among existing non - perturbative methods ,",
    "the qcd sum rules method @xcite is one of the most predictive in studying properties of hadrons .",
    "the main ingredient of the qcd sum rules method is the choice of the interpolating currents which is directly related to the quark content of the corresponding baryons .",
    "approximate flavor symmetries are useful tools in classifying hadrons . breaking of these symmetries might lead to mixing of hadrons which differ only in the flavor quantum numbers .",
    "for example , two baryons that mix due to flavor symmetry violation are @xmath0 and @xmath9 baryons , both of which are made up of @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) quarks .",
    "this mixing of charmed @xmath4 baryons has been calculated using quark model in @xcite and using heavy quark effective theory with @xmath15 corrections , in @xcite . in @xcite , it was shown that this mixing can be important in determining properties of these baryons and a framework has been proposed to calculate this mixing within the qcd sum rules method . in the present work , we demonstrate the new approach for the calculation of the mixing angle between hadrons in the qcd sum rules framework and an application of the proposed method to study the mixing angle between the @xmath0 and @xmath9 baryons carried out .",
    "approximate @xmath16 flavor symmetry of qcd allows us to identify the observed hadrons with multiplet of the @xmath16 group .",
    "if this symmetry were exact , the observed hadrons all would have definite flavor quantum numbers under this flavor symmetry .",
    "the mass differences between the light @xmath17 ,",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath12 quarks , breaks this symmetry explicitly and hence the mass eigenstates need not be definite eigenstates of the @xmath16 symmetry , i.e. definite flavor eigenstates can mix to form the physically observed particles ( unless there is another symmetry which prevents this mixing ) .    in qcd sum rules , the main object of interest is a correlation function of the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the time ordering operator and @xmath21 is an operator that can create the hadron @xmath22 from the vacuum .",
    "if the pure @xmath23 and @xmath24 states mix , then the physical states , i.e. states that have definite mass , should be represented as a linear combination of these states .",
    "in such a case , currents corresponding to physical states should also be written as a superposition of the pure operators : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the mixing angle between @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "consider the following two - point correlation function : @xmath29 if @xmath30 creates only @xmath31 and not the other one , this correlation function should be zero .",
    "hence , the angle @xmath26 should be chosen in such a way as to give @xmath32 .",
    "the general form of the correlation function can be written as @xmath33 generally speaking , any of the functions @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) can be used for the sum rules analysis . in this work , the coefficient of the @xmath36 structure has been chosen to obtain a prediction for the mixing angle .    using the notation",
    "@xmath37 it is straightforward to show that the angle @xmath26 that makes @xmath38 can be expressed as : @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "this expression can be simplified further by noting that , as explicit calculation have shown , @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath44 , which yields @xmath45 note that , eq . [ thetaeq ] has two solutions for @xmath46 that differ by @xmath47 . in this work , we present the solution that is close to @xmath48 .",
    "the other solution corresponds to exchanging the identification of the dominant part of @xmath31 with @xmath49 .",
    "further studies of other properties of @xmath31 baryons is necessary to remove this ambiguity .    after setting up the framework for",
    "the study of the mixing angle between the hadrons , let us concentrate on this mixing angle of the heavy cascade baryons . in @xmath16 classification ,",
    "baryons containing two light and one heavy quarks can be grouped into an anti - triplet and a sextet representation .",
    "it is well known that the dominant components of @xmath0 and @xmath9 belong to the anti - triplet and sextet representations of @xmath16 respectively , i.e. @xmath50 is approximately antisymmetric(symmetric ) under the exchange of light quarks .",
    "the reason of why they are not exactly ( anti)symmetric is the mixing between the @xmath16 representations . note that , in the infinite heavy quark mass limit , there is an additional conserved quantity : the total angular momentum of the light degrees of freedom , @xmath51 . since @xmath52 and @xmath53 correspond to different values of @xmath51 , this additional symmetry prevents the mixing of these two states .    using the @xmath16 classification ,",
    "the interpolating currents for the unmixed states can be chosen as :    @xmath54 \\nonumber \\\\      \\eta_{\\xi'_q}^0 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt2 } \\epsilon^{abc } & & \\left [      ( s_a^t c q_b ) \\gamma_5 q_c +   t(s_a^t c \\gamma_5 q_b ) q_c +      \\right .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\      & & \\left .",

    "s_c   + t(q_a^t c \\gamma_5 q_b ) s_c \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the color indices , @xmath57 or @xmath18 and @xmath58 is an arbitrary auxiliary parameter .",
    "the @xmath59 case , corresponds to the ioffe current .",
    "the notation @xmath60 is used to denote that these operators are pure @xmath61 or @xmath62 operators .",
    "the correlation function , eq . [ corr ] , can also be calculated in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom in the deep euclidean region , @xmath63 , using operator product expansion .",
    "the analytical results for the corresponding correlators are presented in the appendix .",
    "in this section , we present the numerical analysis of our results . the numerical values for the input parameters are @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the sum rules results depend on three auxiliary parameters : the continuum threshold @xmath71 , the borel parameter @xmath72 and the arbitrary parameter @xmath58 in the interpolating current",
    ". the continuum threshold should be close to the first excited state that can couple to the current . in our analysis",
    ", it is chosen to be near @xmath73 .",
    "the lower limit of the working region of the borel parameter can be found by requiring that the contribution of the highest dimensional operator is less than @xmath74 of the perturbative term .",
    "its upper limit is determined in such a way that the contribution of the higher states and the continuum is less then the contribution of the first pole .    in figs .",
    "1(2 ) , the dependence of @xmath75(@xmath76 ) on the borel parameter is plotted , at @xmath77 . for @xmath3 ,",
    "the continuum threshold is chosen to be @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , and for @xmath4 , it is chosen to be @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "it is seen that although the borel parameter is allowed to change in a wide range of values , there is practically no dependence of the predictions of the sum rules on the value of the borel parameter .    in figs .",
    "3(4 ) , the mixing angle @xmath75(@xmath76 ) is plotted as function of @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is defined through @xmath84 at @xmath85 and @xmath86(@xmath87 and @xmath88 ) .",
    "it is seen that in both graphs , the mixing angle take very large values at certain values of @xmath82 .",
    "this enhancement can be understood by noting that the tangent of the mixing angle , eq .",
    "[ tangenttheta ] , is a ratio of two sum rules . in principal , both the numerator and",
    "the denominator should become zero at the same value of @xmath58 .",
    "but due to approximations in the sum rules , their zeros are shifted .",
    "hence , when the denominator becomes zero , and the numerator is non - zero ( although small ) , @xmath89 diverges . near these points",
    "the sum rules is not reliable , hence in obtaining a prediction for the mixing angle , one should keep away from these points . from the figures , it is seen that , sum rule predictions on the mixing angle is almost independent of the value of @xmath58 chosen .    finally , the predictions on the mixing angle between @xmath0 and @xmath1 baryons of qcd sum rules are : @xmath90 for the @xmath91 mixing and @xmath92 for the @xmath93 mixing . in these predictions ,",
    "the uncertainties are due to the neglected higher dimensional operators and the uncertainties in the auxiliary parameters of the sum rules .",
    "the largest source of uncertainty is the variations in the continuum threshold @xmath71 . in table",
    "[ table ] , sum rules predictions and the predictions of @xcite are presented .",
    "it is seen that , within errors , the predictions for @xmath76 are in agreement , whereas , our prediction on @xmath75 is in disagreement with the prediction of @xcite .    as also mentioned previously , in the heavy quark limit",
    ", the mixing angle should be zero .",
    "the heavy quark limit of the sum rules can be obtained by taking the @xmath94 limit after setting @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the new borel parameter , @xmath99 is the four velocity of the heavy baryon , and @xmath100 is the threshold in the heavy quark limit . using the expressions in the appendix",
    ", it can be shown that , in the heavy quark limit @xmath101 .",
    "but the numeric results for the @xmath102 and @xmath56 quarks show that the suppression of the mixing angle in the heavy quark limit is not realized at the physical @xmath102 quark mass .",
    "the suppression starts at much larger values of the heavy quark mass .",
    ".the predictions of qcd sum rules on the mixing angle along with the prediction of quark model @xcite and heavy quark effective theory @xcite [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table ]    in conclusion , a new method is presented for the determination of the mixing angle between the hadrons in qcd sum rules .",
    "this method is applied to the calculation of the mixing angle between the heavy cascade hyperons @xmath0 and @xmath9 .",
    "one of the authors ( v.z . ) is grateful to b. l. ioffe for useful discussion at the early stages of the work .",
    "in this appendix , we present the explicit expression for the coefficient of the @xmath36 structure in the correlation function      where @xmath104(5 + 2 t + 5 t^2 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{1536 \\pi^4 } m_q^3 m_s ( -1 - 4 t + 5 t^2 ) \\left [ 6 \\ln ( 1 + \\hat s ) - \\hat s \\frac{6 + 9 \\hat s + 2 \\hat s^2}{(1+\\hat s)^2 } \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & - \\frac{1}{192 \\pi^2 } m_q ( \\qd + \\qs ) \\frac{\\hat s^2}{(1 + \\hat s)^2 } ( -1 -4 t + 5 t^2 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & &   - \\frac{1}{192 \\pi^2 } m_s \\hat s \\frac{2 + \\hat s}{(1 + \\hat s)^2 } \\qd ( -13 + 2 t + 11 t^2 )   \\nonumber \\\\ & & -   \\frac{1}{768 m_q \\pi^2 } m_0 ^ 2 ( \\qd + \\qs ) \\frac{1}{(1+\\hat s)^2 } ( -1+t ) ( -1 - 5 t + 6 \\hat s(1 + t ) ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & +   \\frac{1}{768 m_q^2 \\pi^2 } m_s m_0 ^ 2 ( \\qd + \\qs ) \\frac{1}{(1 + \\hat s)^2}(-1+t)^2   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{16 m_q^2 \\pi^2 } m_s m_0 ^ 2 \\qd \\frac{1}{(1 + \\hat s)^3 } ( 1-t^2 ) \\ln \\hat s   \\nonumber \\\\ & & -   \\frac{1}{32 \\pi^2 m^2 } m_s m_0 ^ 2 \\qd ( -1+t^2 ) \\left [ \\ln \\frac{m_q^2}{\\lambda^2 } + \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{(1+\\hat s)^2}\\right)\\ln \\hat s \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      where @xmath106 ( 5 + 2 t + 5 t^2 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{3}{512 \\pi^4 } m_q^3 m_s ( -1   +   t^2 ) \\left [ 6 \\ln ( 1 + \\hat s ) - \\hat s \\frac{6 + 9 \\hat s + 2 \\hat s^2}{(1+\\hat s)^2 } \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & - \\frac{3}{64 \\pi^2 } m_q ( \\qd + \\qs ) \\frac{\\hat s^2}{(1 + \\hat s)^2 } ( -1   +   t^2 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & -    \\frac{1}{64 \\pi^2 } m_s \\hat s \\frac{2 +   \\hat s}{(1 + \\hat s)^2 } \\qd ( -1+t)^2   \\nonumber \\\\ & & -   \\frac{1}{256 m_q \\pi^2 } m_0 ^ 2 ( \\qd + \\qs ) \\frac{6",
