    "affine diffeomorphism _ of @xmath770 is by definition the composite of maps of the form @xmath261 and @xmath769 in @xmath781 .",

    "the remaining property  3 follows immediately from theorem  2 in walters paper  @xcite .",

    "here we explain that the fiberwise anosov diffeomorphism @xmath320 constructed in section  [ section_anosov_bundles ] can be viewed as a partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism and point out certain properties of this diffeomorphism .",
    "first we need to recall some definitions from partially hyperbolic dynamics . given a closed riemannian manifold @xmath128 a diffeomorphism @xmath807 is called _ partially hyperbolic _ if there exists a continuous @xmath543-invariant non - trivial splitting of the tangent bundle @xmath808 and positive constants @xmath809 , @xmath810 , and @xmath811 such that for @xmath812 @xmath813 it is well known that the distributions @xmath814 and @xmath815 integrate uniquely to foliations @xmath816 and @xmath817 .",

    "note that this proposition applies to @xmath320 constructed in section  [ section_anosov_bundles ] .",
    "recall that , by construction , the total space @xmath256 is diffeomorphic to @xmath806 , where @xmath260 is a homotopy @xmath264-sphere , obtained by clutching using diffeomorphism @xmath241 .    in general ,",
    "the center foliation @xmath821 of a dynamically coherent partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism is continuous foliation with smooth leaves . to the best of our knowledge ,",

    "for each @xmath831 consider the the preimage @xmath832 .",

    "* theorem  a.1 ) , we obtain that , in fact , @xmath833 are smoothly embedded submanifolds of @xmath120 whose tangent space @xmath834 depends continuously on @xmath831 . hence @xmath819 is a continuous foliation by smooth compact leaves .",
    "moreover , this foliation is @xmath262-invariant .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath819 is the pullback of the `` horizontal '' foliation on @xmath835 and @xmath836 is a conjugacy between @xmath262 and @xmath837 ( recall , that in the proof of theorem  [ thm_anosov_sc ] we have identified @xmath2 with a particular fiber @xmath55 ) .",
    "therefore the distribution @xmath838 is @xmath543-invariant .",
    "then , because the dynamics induced by @xmath262 on the base is @xmath171 , one can check that @xmath262 is partially hyperbolic with respect to the @xmath543-invariant splitting @xmath839 .    since @xmath819 is a compact foliation , hirsch - pugh - shub structural stability theorem  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 7.1 ) in conjunction with the result which verifies plaque expansivity hypothesis for applying hirsch - pugh - shub structural stability ( see @xcite ) yields that @xmath262 is robustly dynamically coherent .",
    "now , for any @xmath258 sufficiently @xmath147 close to @xmath262 the center foliation @xmath820 is @xmath147 close to @xmath819 and , hence , is transverse to the fibers of @xmath13 .",
    "therefore @xmath820 defines holonomy homeomorphisms @xmath840 .",

    "note that if @xmath820 is smooth then holonomies are smooth and the trivialization will be smooth as well . hence @xmath820 can not be smooth , because @xmath13 is smoothly non - trivial .",
    "it would be very interesting to generalize our results ( theorems  [ thm_anosov_sc ] ,  [ thm_anosov_nil ] , and  [ thm_anosov_flows ] ) to the more general setting of bundles that admit fiberwise partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms ( see section  [ sec_61 ] for the definition of a partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism ) .",

    "let @xmath841 be an anosov diffeomorphism , then @xmath842 is partially hyperbolic .",
    "by multiplying the hopf fibration by @xmath843 we can view @xmath844 as the total space of the fiber bundle @xmath845 .",
