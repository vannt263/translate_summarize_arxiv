    "the @xmath0 interaction is the main mechanism driving the weak decay of heavy enough hypernuclei , see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews . in this transition ,",
    "each of the two final nucleons obtains a kinetic energy of about @xmath1 mev , which allows them to escape or break any hypernucleus .",
    "this is in contrast with the mesonic decay , @xmath2 , which is responsible for the weak decay of the lightest hypernuclei and of the @xmath3 in free space . in this latter case the final nucleon and pion share a kinetic energy of only @xmath4 mev . for hypernuclei larger than @xmath5 this energy may not be enough for the nucleon to overcome the pauli - blocking of the nuclear medium , and the one - nucleon induced decay mode dominates the decay process . the two - nucleon induced mechanism , @xmath6 , also contributes to the weak decay , but it only represents about 20@xmath7 of the non - mesonic weak decay amplitude  @xcite .    in hypernuclear experiments it is possible to measure the lifetime of a hypernucleus before it decays , as well as the angular and energetic distributions of the protons and neutrons emerging from the decay .",
    "from these quantities one can obtain information about three independent observables that constrain the two - body @xmath0 interaction : the total non - mesonic decay rate , @xmath8 , the neutron- or proton - induced decay rates , @xmath9 or @xmath10 , and the asymmetry between the intensities of protons going up and down the polarization axis of the hypernucleus .",
    "this last measurement is related to the interference between the parity - conserving ( pc ) and parity - violating ( pv ) parts of the @xmath0 amplitude .",
    "using experimental data on the weak decay for both @xmath11 and @xmath12shell hypernuclei one is able to extract at most six independent observables .",
    "the weak @xmath13 @xmath14 interaction may also be constrained , in principle , by its experimental study in free space . on the one hand through direct @xmath15 scattering , and on the other through the @xmath3 production reaction @xmath16 .",
    "however both possibilities present great experimental difficulties , the former one due to the small lifetime of the @xmath3 ( @xmath17 s ) and the corresponding difficulty to produce stable @xmath3 beams , and the latter due to the very small cross section for the @xmath16 transition ( @xmath18 mb )  @xcite .",
    "currently we must rely on hypernuclear decay data to relate the theoretical description of this two - body interaction with the experiment . the experimental status and",
    "perspectives on non - mesonic weak decay has been recently reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "theoretical studies of the non - mesonic weak decay amplitude were first based on one - meson - exchange ( ome ) models ( see for example refs .",
    "these models describe the long range part of the interaction through the exchange of one pion , and the shorter ranges through the exchange of heavier mesons , the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which allow to mediate the strangeness exchange transition through weak vertices like @xmath24 or @xmath25 . with the advent of the more systematic effective field theory ( eft ) formalism , and in particular with its successful description of the nn strong interaction  @xcite",
    ", first steps were done in applying eft also to the description of the non - mesonic weak decay .",
    "the eft for the @xmath0 potential was first studied at leading order ( lo ) in refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the eft was further developed up to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , including all the possible two - pion - exchange ( tpe ) diagrams contributing to the transition .",
    "the potential was calculated in momentum space , and expressions in terms of master integrals were given separately for each diagram .    in the present work",
    "we provide all the needed expressions in coordinate space .",
    "the different contributions to the transition potential are written in terms of 20 operational structures .",
    "notably , a simplified version of the transition potential , obtained neglecting the baryonic mass differences of virtual baryons , provides a compelling description of the full potential .",
    "these should be readily useful for ab - initio few - body computations of the weak decay of hypernuclei  @xcite .",
    "the manuscript is organized in the following way . in the beginning of sect .",
    "[ sec2 ] we review the eft formalism used to calculate the non - mesonic weak transition .",
    "the eft potentials up to nlo are derived in coordinate space and presented in terms of spin and isospin operators instead of diagrams .",
    "this allows us to plot for each operator the lo and the nlo potentials , and thus evaluate the magnitude of the two - pion exchanges in the @xmath0 amplitude .",
    "the comparison is provided for each operational structure appearing in the transition potential . for the nlo",
    ", we derive approximate potentials neglecting the mass difference among the virtual baryons and compare them with the exact ones . in sect .",
    "[ sec3 ] we discuss the properties of the obtained potentials , including the comparison between the approximate and exact nlo potentials .",
    "a brief summary and conclusions are provided in sect .",
    "details of the calculation and the expressions for the potentials in coordinate space are provided in the appendices .",
    "the eft potential for the @xmath26 transition is built as an expansion on a parameter @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 representing the low and high energy scales that characterize the interaction .",
    "these energy scales are determined by the typical momenta and masses involved in the weak decay process . since the reaction is exothermic ( @xmath30 ) , the momenta of the emerging nucleons are larger than the ones for the initial @xmath3 and nucleon .",
    "the momenta of the @xmath3 and the nucleon in the center of mass are labelled as @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and the momenta of the final two nucleons as @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the low - energy scale in the expansion parameter depends thus on two momenta , the initial momentum @xmath31 , of roughly @xmath35 mev , and the transferred momentum @xmath36 , of the order of @xmath37 mev .",
    "besides the @xmath3 and the nucleon we include the pion and the kaon as virtual mesons to be exchanged among the baryons and the @xmath38 as an intermediate baryonic state .",
    "therefore , the characteristic low - energy scales are also the pion and kaon masses and the mass differences between the @xmath3 , the @xmath38 and the nucleon . for the high - energy scale",
    "we take the chiral symmetry breaking scale , which is of the order of the mass of the baryons appearing in the interaction , around @xmath39 mev .",
    "once the expansion parameter and the degrees of freedom are defined we use weinberg power - counting  @xcite to organize the potential into the different orders . at lo",
    "the potential includes the exchanges of the lightest pseudoscalar mesons and the non - derivative operators representing contact interactions . the @xmath19-exchange is not included due to its small coupling , thus the one - meson - exchanges consist of the one - pion- and one - kaon - exchanges ( ope and oke ) .",
    "the nlo includes all the possible ways in which the @xmath3 and the nucleon can exchange two pions and the contact interactions containing one or two powers of momenta .",
    "the kaon - pion and the two - kaon exchange are not included in the nlo , first because their contribution is expected to be much smaller due to the larger mass of the kaon , and also to avoid adding further unknown ( and therefore , model dependent ) couplings to the theory .",
