    "the gas in galactic disks occurs in a wide range of temperatures and densities , most of which are unsuitable for star formation . somehow , diffuse atomic clouds are collected into colder , denser molecular clouds that can collapse under their own gravity .",
    "molecular condensation is not directly observable , but it most likely arises in cold , quiescent pockets of atomic hydrogen ( h  i ) gas , which over time will form molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath0 ) followed by more observable molecular species . using algorithms developed previously ( gibson  2005a , b ) , we have mapped the cold h  i population traced by h  i self - absorption ( hisa ; gibson  2000 ) against warmer h  i emission in three large h  i synthesis surveys ( gibson 2010 ; see table  1 ) .",
    "we then measured the mean fraction of positions with hisa that also have co emission in other surveys ( table  1 ; figure  1 ) to evaluate the evolutionary state of the hisa clouds .",
    "we find that most hisa outside the sun s orbit lacks co emission at the same position and velocity , while most inner - galaxy hisa has overlapping co , but the latter may be illusory . if the expected number of hisa - co matches due to chance alignments is removed , then the inner - galaxy hisa - co correspondence drops below @xmath28 . since hisa temperatures are too cold to explain easily with purely atomic gas ( wolfire  2003 ) , many hisa features may trace cold h  i inside h@xmath0 clouds that lack adequate uv shielding for abundant co ( e.g. , wolfire  2010 ) .",
    "we also find that co positions with hisa are even less common than hisa positions with co , with a low enough fraction ( @xmath29 ) to raise concerns about the use of hisa to resolve near / far kinematic distance ambiguities in inner - galaxy sight lines .",
    "future steps in the analysis include corrections for fcrao co `` error beam '' sidelobe contamination , incorporation of other surveys , including galfa- h  i data from arecibo , and comparison to synthetic observations of galactic disk models ."
