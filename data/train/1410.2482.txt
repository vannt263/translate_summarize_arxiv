    "as the natural extension of the theories of toric and quasitoric manifolds , as well as the theory of symplectic manifolds with hamiltonian compact torus action , we proposed in  @xcite the theory of @xmath19-manifolds .",
    "this theory studies the smooth manifolds @xmath20 with a smooth action of a compact torus @xmath21 and an analogous of a moment map @xmath22 .",
    "the main examples of @xmath19-manifolds are grassmann manifolds and one of our key aims is to apply the achievements of toric geometry and topology for the solution of the well known problems on grassmann manifolds . in that context",
    "our aim in this paper is to extract the properties from the crucial examples of such manifolds and to describe the corresponding orbit spaces .    more precisely , our focus in this paper is on the complex grassmann manifold @xmath1 and the complex projective space @xmath4 endowed with the action of the compact torus @xmath0 . in the case of @xmath1",
    "we consider the canonical action of the torus @xmath0 , while in the case of @xmath4 the action of @xmath0 is given by the composition of the second symmetric power @xmath5 and the standard action of @xmath6 on @xmath4 . in both cases",
    "the action extends to the action of the algebraic torus @xmath23 .",
    "our approach makes us possible to obtain the results about the geometry and topology of these actions using the methods of toric geometry and toric topology . in connection with this",
    "we want to recall the paper  @xcite , where it were introduced and studied some polyhedra in the real grassmann manifolds which are called grassmannian simplices . for an arbitrary grassmann manifold these polyhedra",
    "are obtained as the generalization of the standard simplices in the real projective space .",
    "we want here to emphasize that such simplices exist for any smooth toric manifold .",
    "namely , for a smooth toric manifold @xmath20 with the moment map @xmath24 there exists a continious section @xmath25 , @xmath26 , such that this section gives equivariant surjection @xmath27 in that sense the simplices considered in  @xcite are the reflexion of the general fact in toric topology .",
    "therefore , our aim is not only to obtain the results on geometry and topology of the compact torus action on a smooth manifold , but also to study them from the point of view of the existence of the corresponding sections .    on the contrary to the case of toric manifold , where the section exists over the whole polytope @xmath28 , it the case of real or complex grassamnn manifold @xmath29 such section over @xmath30 which is hypersimplex @xmath31",
    "does not exist .",
    "instead , in this paper we will consider the cell complex for @xmath1 consisting of the grassmannian simplices in terminology of  @xcite and the question of the existence of the section over such complex .",
    "in the case of the grassmannian @xmath1 we use the standard moment map arising from the plcker embedding of @xmath1 in @xmath4 .",
    "the image of this moment map in both cases is the octahedron @xmath32 .",
    "the action of @xmath23 allows us to use the classical results of algebraic geometry about the image of the algebraic torus orbits by the moment map .",
    "the canonical action of the compact torus @xmath33 extends to the action of the algebraic torus @xmath34 on general grassmann manifold @xmath29 . in connection with such action of algebraic torus",
    "it is defined the notion of the main stratum  @xcite , it is the set @xmath35 consisting of the points @xmath36 such that the image by the standard moment map of the closure of the orbit @xmath37 is the whole hypersimplex @xmath31 . nevertheless , the closed subset @xmath38 is again invariant under the action of @xmath34 and its image by the moment map is again the whole hypersimplex @xmath31 .",
    "the description of the action of @xmath33 on the main stratum @xmath39 is simple , since it is homeomorphic to @xmath40 , for some space @xmath41 .",
    "still the description of the action of @xmath33 on @xmath42 remains highly nontrivial problem . in this paper , using the methods of toric topology , we solve this problem in the case of grassmannian @xmath1 .",
    "we prove that @xmath43 is homeomorphic to the join @xmath44 , while @xmath45 is homeomorphic to the join @xmath8 , where @xmath46 .",
    "moreover , we prove that @xmath2 is topological manifold without boundary , and , thus it is homeomorphic to @xmath3 . in the same time",
    "we describe the smooth and singular points of the orbit space @xmath47 .",
    "it gives that the projection @xmath48 is not a smooth map for the unique , the standard one , differentiable structure on @xmath3 .",
    "the action of @xmath0 on @xmath1 and @xmath49 induces the action of the group @xmath14 on the real grassmann manifold @xmath12 and real projective space @xmath50 .",
    "all our constructions in the complex case are compatible with the involution given by the complex conjugation and , thus , give the corresponding results in the real case .",
    "we prove that the orbit space @xmath15 is homeomorphic to the sphere @xmath16 and that the orbits space @xmath17 is homeomorphic to the join @xmath18 .",
    "we also describe the smooth and the singular points of the orbit space @xmath51 .",
    "it implies that there is no differentiable structure on the sphere @xmath16 such that the natural projection @xmath52 is a smooth map .",
    "we want to note that there is a series of papers  @xcite ,  @xcite,@xcite about the hamiltonian action of the torus @xmath53 on a symplectic manifold @xmath20 . in our paper",
    "we have such an action of the torus @xmath54 on @xmath1 .",
    "but , we also have the action of the torus @xmath54 on @xmath4 , which is an example of hamiltonian action of the torus @xmath55 on a symplectic manifold @xmath20 . in that sense",
    ", we consider the case which is studied in the mentioned series of papers by the methods of symplectic geometry , but also the more general case .",
    "we hope if develop the theory of hamiltonian action of the torus @xmath21 on a symplectic manifold @xmath20 , where @xmath56 , the example of the action of @xmath54 on @xmath4 studied in detail in our paper will be useful .    in the paper",
    "@xcite it is considered interpretation of the complex and real grassmann manifold , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , as configuration manifolds of @xmath59 points in @xmath60-dimensional complex or real vector space .",
    "such interpretation is in  @xcite further used for the description of the action of the group @xmath34 on @xmath57 and the action of the group @xmath61 on @xmath58 , where it is constructed the models for @xmath62 and @xmath63 by proving that they naturally diffeomorphic to the spaces @xmath64 and @xmath65 of equivalence classes of generic configurations of @xmath59 points in @xmath66 or @xmath67 .",
    "still the questions on cohomology structure or homotopy type of these orbit spaces are not completely answered .",
    "the model spaces @xmath65 found further important applications for example in  @xcite . in connection with this , our results about the orbit spaces of the action of compact torus @xmath68 on @xmath57 and the action of @xmath69 on @xmath58 have applications as the results about configuration spaces of @xmath59 points in @xmath60-dimensional spaces .",
    "denote by @xmath29 the grassmann manifold of all @xmath60-dimensional subspaces in @xmath70 .",
    "we consider the canonical actions of algebraic torus @xmath34 and compact torus @xmath68 on @xmath29 .",
    "note that @xmath71 .",
    "recall that the canonical action of @xmath34 on @xmath29 is induced from the canonical of @xmath34 on @xmath72 which is given by @xmath73 for @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "we denote by @xmath76 the orbit of an element @xmath77 under the action of the algebraic torus @xmath78 and by @xmath79 its closure in @xmath29 .",
    "it is known that @xmath80 is a compact algebraic manifold which consists of finitely many @xmath78 - orbits and @xmath80 is a toric manifold in which @xmath81 is unique everywhere dense open orbit .",
    "note that the action of @xmath78 on @xmath29 is not effective , namely each point in @xmath29 is fixed by diagonal subgroup @xmath82 . because of that we will further equally consider the effective action of @xmath83 given by the embedding @xmath84 .",
    "recall the notion of the plcker coordinates on grassmann manifolds .",
    "we consider first the stiefel manifold @xmath85 of the orthonormal frames in @xmath70 . there is the canonical embedding of @xmath85 into @xmath86 , where @xmath87 which to each @xmath60-reaper assigns @xmath88-matrix @xmath89 .",
    "this embedding is equivariant related to the action of the group @xmath90 on @xmath88-matrices , where the group @xmath91 acts from the left , while the group @xmath92 acts from the right .",

    "this embedding is equivariant related to the representation @xmath103 , which is given by the @xmath60-th exterior power of the standard representation of @xmath33 into @xmath70 .    in order to make the exposition simpler",

    "it is defined the moment map @xmath104 , first in  @xcite and  @xcite , by @xmath105 here @xmath106 goes through @xmath60-element subsets of @xmath107 and @xmath108 is given by @xmath109 for @xmath110 , while @xmath111 for @xmath112 .",
    "the moment map is equivariant under the action of compact torus meaning that @xmath113 .",
    "it easily follows since @xmath114 , where @xmath115 .",
    "the image of the moment map is hypersimplex @xmath116 which can be defined as the set of all points @xmath117 such that @xmath118 and @xmath119 .    by the classical convexity theorem of  @xcite and",
    "@xcite it follows that @xmath120 is a convex polytope for any @xmath77 .",
    "more precisely the following result holds :    [ moment - map - polytope ] let @xmath76 be an orbit of an element @xmath77 under the canonical action of @xmath34 . then @xmath120 is a convex polytope in @xmath121 whose vertex set is given by @xmath122 the mapping @xmath123 gives a bijection between @xmath124-dimensional orbits of the group @xmath34 in @xmath80 and @xmath124-dimensional open faces of the polytope @xmath120 .",
    "we want to recall that the convexity theorem states that the image of the moment map is convex hull of the images of fixed points for a hamiltonian torus action on compact , connected , symplectic manifold .",
    "the example of such action is the standard action of @xmath33 on @xmath125 endowed with the khler structure given by the fubini - study metric and with the standard moment map @xmath126 given by @xmath127 the composition of this moment map together with plcker embedding of the grassmann manifold into complex projective space gives the moment map  .",
    "this follows from the following more general result .",
    "namely , according to  @xcite , if a compact lie group @xmath128 acts on @xmath129 via homomorphism @xmath130 and @xmath131 is a nonsingular subvariety invariant under the action of @xmath128 , than the restriction of fubini - study metric on @xmath129 gives @xmath132 a khler structure that is preserved by @xmath128 .",
    "moreover , a moment map @xmath133 , where @xmath134 denotes the lie algebra for @xmath128 , is defined by @xmath135 where @xmath136 and @xmath137 is non - zero vector in @xmath138 lying over the point @xmath139 .",
    "in recalling the notion of the strata on grassmanians we follow  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "we provide three definitions of the strata on grassmannians for which it is proved in  @xcite ,  @xcite to be equivalent .    1",
    ".   for the standard orthonormal basis @xmath140 in @xmath72 and @xmath60 - dimensional complex subspace @xmath77 there are @xmath59 vectors @xmath141 determined by the projection @xmath142",

    "two points @xmath145 are said to belong to the same grassmann stratum @xmath39 of @xmath29 if @xmath147 3 .",
    "it is well known the notion of the schubert cell decompositions for the grassmann manifolds .",
    "these decompositions are parametrized by the complete flags in @xmath70 .",
    "more precisely , to the standard orthonormal basis @xmath140 in @xmath72 it corresponds the flag @xmath148 , where @xmath149 . the schubert cell decomposition for the grassmannain @xmath29 corresponding to this flag is defined as follows : for the schubert symbol @xmath150 , where @xmath151 , the schubert cell is defined by @xmath152 for any permutation @xmath153 one can consider the new orthonormal basis @xmath154 in @xmath70 and the corresponding flag @xmath155 , where @xmath156 .",

    "it implies that the image of the closure of @xmath23-orbit for @xmath187 has four vertices in the case when two plcker coordinates for @xmath36 with no common index are zero .",
    "we obtain the following : @xmath198 @xmath199 @xmath200    to describe the triangles that can be obtained as the images of the moment map for @xmath80 we note that @xmath36 must have exactly three zero plcker coordinates .",

    "obviously it is possible .",
    "we derive form lemma  [ polytopes ] the following table in which the first row gives the dimensions of the polytopes which are obtained as the image of the orbits on @xmath1 by the moment map , while the second row gives their number in corresponding dimension : @xmath209.\\ ] ] we explain these polytopes in more detail .",
    "note that the points @xmath210 belong to the hyperplane in @xmath211 given by the equation @xmath212 .",

    "moreover each of four vertices which by lemma  [ polytopes ] span the polytope belong to the same plane in this hyperplane .",
    "now lemma  [ polytopes ] gives that in the image of the moment map we have the polytope @xmath32 which is convex hull of the vertices @xmath213 .",

    "the other @xmath214 three - dimensional polytopes are the pyramids having one of the three diagonal rectangles as the basis . among two - dimensional polytopes",
    "there are @xmath215 triangles forming the boundary of the octahedron and three diagonal rectangles inside of an octahedron .",
    "the one - dimensional polytopes are those from the boundary from the octahedron .",
    "note that not every polytope spanned by some subset of vertices for @xmath32 can be realised as the polytope of the moment map .",
    "more precisely , except for the three squares and six pyrhamids , none of the polytope which intersect the interior of the octahedron can not be obtained as the image of the moment map for some orbit on @xmath1 .",
    "the admissible polytopes in @xmath32 of dimension three are not simple polytopes , while all polytopes in dimension @xmath216 are simple .      as we see from its definition each stratum on grassmannian maps by the moment map to the interior of exactly one polytope which we will call the polytope of the stratum . in this context",
    "we will use the phrase a stratum over the polytope .",
    "there is a bijection between all polytopes in the image of the moment map and all strata on grassmannian . in this way",
    "the table   shows that stratification of @xmath1 consists of @xmath217 strata corresponding to the polytopes in the image of the moment map .",
    "for example , there are @xmath218 strata that map to the interior of three - dimensional polytopes and they can be described as follows : @xmath219 @xmath220 where @xmath221 and @xmath222 . here",

    "we use the results from previous sections to describe the topological structure of the orbit space @xmath2 .",
    "we first note that using pl \" ucker coordinates there is on @xmath1 canonical atlas consisting of six charts : for any @xmath227 , @xmath228 , we have a chart @xmath229 .",

    "the action of the compact torus @xmath0 on the complex grassmann manifold @xmath1 and the complex projective space @xmath4 induces naturally the action of the group @xmath14 on the real grassmann manifold @xmath12 and the real projective space @xmath13 .",
    "the importance for the consideration of the real case is connected with the problematics and the result of  @xcite and  @xcite .    since all our constructions in the complex case given in the previous sections are compatible with the involution given by the complex conjugation the results obtained in the complex case translates directly to the real case .",
    "therefore theorem  [ orbit - space-4 ] implies :    the orbits space @xmath860 for the canonical action of @xmath14 on @xmath12 is homeomorphic to the quotient space @xmath861    the orbit space @xmath15 is homeomorphic to the join @xmath862 and , thus , homotopy equivalent to @xmath16 .",
    "we can proceed in the same way as in the proof of theorem  [ orbit - main ] and theorem  [ top - main ] to obtain :    the orbit space @xmath860 is homeomorphic to the sphere @xmath16 .    as for the induced action of @xmath14 on @xmath13 , from theorem  [ orbit - space-5 ]",

    "we provide the proof for the sake of clearness .",
    "we use the notation of  [ gen - smth ] and follow the proof of theorem  [ smain ] .",

    "consider an orthogonal decomposition @xmath890 for some @xmath891-invariant metric .",

    "we derive from section  [ structure ] and section  [ orbit ] some properties of the standard action of the compact torus @xmath0 on @xmath1 which we found to be crucial for the topological description of its orbit space .",
    "the following properties immediately follows :      1 .",
    "there exists a smooth atlas @xmath910 for @xmath132 such that each chart @xmath911 is everywhere dense set in @xmath132 and contains exactly one fixed point which maps to zero by the coordinate map .",
