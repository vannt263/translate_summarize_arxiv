    "using an automatic feynman graph calculation package , we can generate the information of all feynman graphs for given processes .",
    "sometimes it is necessary to select graphs from the set of all graphs by some conditions .",
    "however , it is not so easy to select them correctly by hand when a huge number of graphs is involved , such as higher order corrections or susy processes .",
    "a program grcsel selects out a subset of feynman graphs from the set of graphs , generated by grace@xcite , according to given selection conditions .",
    "the output information of selected graphs is written in the same format as that of the original set .",
    "this enables us to generate feynman amplitudes within grace in the same procedure as for all graphs .",
    "so we can perform cross section calculation , gauge invariance check , event generation and so on for the selected ones .",
    "grcsel helps us :    1 .   to find decay - graphs and evaluate signal / background ratio , 2 .   to check the accuracy of approximated calculation , 3 .   to confirm precision of the calculation , 4 .   to reduce the calculation time , 5 .   to develop kinematics routine",
    "grcsel consists of three parts : a steering - part defines basic functions of graph selections and reads input files , an interpreter - part parses and evaluates commands , and a utility - part handles subsets of particles , vertices and graphs .",
    "once a physics process and the order of calculation are fixed , feynman graphs are generated by grc program with specified feynman rules described in physics model file@xcite .",
    "the information on graphs generated are stored in a file named out.grf ( we call the format of this file _ ` .grf ` format _ ) .",
    "grcsel reads the physics model file and out.grf and selects graphs according to a kind of propagator , characteristics of graph topology , a type of vertex or a graph number .",
    "grcsel outputs those selected graphs in the same format as out.grf . successively",
    "this output file can be used as the input to source code generation for monte carlo integration or event generation .",
    "we can also use grcsel again reading output of previous execution of grcsel .",
    "the schematic view of how grcsel works in grace system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : grcsel ] .",
    "graph selection starts by the program grcsel :    grcsel    this program requires out.grf file by default .",
    "the graph selection commands are read through standard input , which may be given interactively or by a script file . with a script file where grcsel commands are prepared",
    ", we can redirect that file :    grcsel < command.in    to use another input .grf format file , e.g. out1.grf , instead of out.grf , we can add the filename after grcsel command as :    grcsel out1.grf",
    "< command.in      in a script file there are a series of grcsel commands such as declaration of variables and basic functions to specify the selection conditions or operators .",
    "grcsel has 14 basic functions in total .",
    "three of them return a subset of graphs in accordance with specified selection condition and two functions output set of graphs .",
    "they are summarized in table  [ tab : func ] .",
    ".basic functions to select and output graphs . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in the following example , graphs with @xmath0 propagator connected to the initial electron and final @xmath1 are selected among graphs of @xmath2 process .",
    "selected graphs are output into a file named out1.grf .    ....",
    "% e+ e- -- > w+ w- photon % % out1.grf : with neutrino propagator   % at the vertex of initial electron and % final w- .",
    "%    gset gs0 , gs1 ;    gs0 = ~ [ ] ;    % all graphs    gs1 = cutprop(gs0 , [ `` nu - e '' ] , [ 0,3 ] ) ;    outgset(``out1.grf '' , gs1 ) ;    quit ; ....    in fig .",
    "[ fig : wwa - select ] , selected graphs are shown .",
    "grcsel has been developed in the framework of grace 2.1.7.4 .",
    "it can handle tree and 1-loop graphs and it supports standard and mssm physics model .",
    "grcsel is included in a distribution kit of grace 2.1.7.4 .",
