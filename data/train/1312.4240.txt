    "<S> the existence of noncompatible observables in quantum theory makes a direct operational interpretation of two - point correlation functions problematic . </S>",
    "<S> here we challenge such a view by explicitly constructing a measuring scheme that , independently of the input state @xmath0 and observables @xmath1 and @xmath2 , performs an unbiased optimal estimation of the two - point correlation function @xmath3 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that , also in quantum theory , two - point correlation functions are as operational as any other expectation value . a very simple probabilistic implementation of our proposal is presented .    in the description of stochastic physical processes , it is important to determine how dynamical variables are correlated with each other . </S>",
    "<S> correlation functions are computed as products of two ( or more ) dynamical variables ( or their powers ) , averaged over time , or over many sites , or in both ways . in the simplest case of the average of the product of two dynamical variables , </S>",
    "<S> one usually speaks of _ two - point correlation functions_.    in classical physics , dynamical variables are real - valued functions of the state of the system . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the state of the system can be fully specified , in principle , by giving the values of all its dynamical variables ( or its generating set of variables ) , at any instant in time . in classical statistical mechanics , therefore , there is no difficulty in defining and computing correlation functions , however complicated , between dynamical variables ; as dynamical variables are all experimentally accessible , so are all correlation functions .    in quantum mechanics , on the contrary </S>",
    "<S> , the relation between states and dynamical variables is much more subtle . in particular , the notion of dynamical variables is replaced by that of _ observables _ , namely , self - adjoint operators that can or can not commute ; this is the formal reason for the existence of `` incompatible '' variables that can not simultaneously assume definite values in any state  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this feature arguably lies at the origin of all `` quantum spooks , '' including a prevailing view that correlation functions are typically ill - defined for a quantum mechanical system  if two observables do not both have a definite value simultaneously , how could one compute the average of their product then ?    </S>",
    "<S> interpretational problems notwithstanding , one still can formally define _ two - point quantum correlation functions _ as @xmath4 $ ] , where @xmath0 describes the state of the system and @xmath1 , @xmath2 are any two observables ( or , possibly , the same observable at different times , in which case we more precisely speak of _ auto - correlation functions _ ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , such functions are extensively used in a wide variety of fields , such as quantum statistical mechanics  @xcite , quantum thermodynamics  @xcite , and quantum field theory  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the question then naturally arises , whether quantum correlation functions can be given a clear operational interpretation .    for the sake of concreteness , suppose we are given a source , in control , emitting independent systems , all of them in the same ( though unknown ) state . </S>",
    "<S> we are also given two measuring apparatuses , as accurate as the theory ( classical or quantum ) allows , one to measure observable @xmath1 , the other for observable @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that both apparatuses can be initialized and re - used an arbitrary number of times . in classical physics , these assumptions are enough to allow us to measure , in principle , not only the expected values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , but also any moment of these , i.e. any two - point correlation function . </S>",
    "<S> this is possible because , classically , measurement does not imply disturbance . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one can perform successive measurements of @xmath1 and @xmath2 on the same system , collect the results , and post - process them at will . </S>",
    "<S> for example , auto - correlation functions in classical physics are computed by measuring a certain observable twice on the same system , at different times . on the other hand , in quantum theory , </S>",
    "<S> such a simple approach is often impossible due to the existence of incompatible observables , as a measurement done now unavoidably disturbs the evolution of the system and , therefore , the result of a measurement performed on the system at later times , unless the measurement satisfies quantum non - demolition conditions ; see for instance ref .  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> for this reason it seems that two - point correlation functions ( and auto - correlation functions , in particular ) can not be interpreted operationally in quantum theory , in the sense that they can not be directly measured experimentally . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we argue that this would be too hurried a conclusion . </S>",
    "<S> our contribution is to construct a `` black - box''like approach to quantum correlation functions , working for ( but being independent of ) any state @xmath0 and any pair of observables @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : black - box ] below ) .    . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum system , in state @xmath0 , is fed into the black - box . </S>",
    "<S> the output consists of two quantum systems , on which independent measurements of observables @xmath1 and @xmath2 are performed . </S>",
    "<S> the data collected are then recombined by a purely classical post - processing , resulting in the value @xmath4 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> notice that both the black - box @xmath5 and the final classical post - processing are independent of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in this sense , </S>",
    "<S> the black - box @xmath5 and the post - processing are _ </S>",
    "<S> universal_. ]    first , the quantum system of interest is fed through a black - box @xmath5 , what we call the `` ideal two - point correlator . '' </S>",
    "<S> the black - box in turns produces two output systems , on which the two observables @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be independently measured , even if they were incompatible . </S>",
    "<S> the recorded values are finally post - processed according to a _ fixed _ post - processing function such that , if the system was initially prepared in state @xmath0 , the average result equals @xmath4 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> since both the quantum black - box and the classical post - processing are independent of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , our scheme shows that quantum two - point correlation functions are no less operational than any other expectation value , challenging the common understanding explained above and suggesting , at the same time , new experimental procedures to directly measure them .    in the rest of the paper , we will explicitly construct the black - box and the post - processing function allowing the experimental assessment of any two - point quantum correlation function of the form @xmath4 $ ] , for any state @xmath0 and any pair of observables @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , both the quantum pre - processing and the classical post - processing will be independent of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , thus providing a _ universal _ strategy . </S>",
    "<S> we will also prove that our strategy is _ optimal _ , for any state @xmath0 and any observables @xmath1 and @xmath2 , in the sense that it always minimizes the error propagation due to the final post - processing of data . </S>",

    "<S> conclusions._in this work we provided two point correlation functions with a new operational interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> we did this by explicitly constructing a `` universal optimal two - point quantum correlator , '' namely , a measuring apparatus which , independently of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , performs an unbiased optimal ( in a statistical sense ) estimation of the ideal two - point correlation function @xmath3 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> this proves that , despite the interpretational difficulties due to noncommutativity of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , two - point correlation functions are as operational as any other expectation value .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude with a proposal for an experiment probabilitistically implementing the real part @xmath38 of the universal two - point correlator . </S>",

    "<S> finally , phase shifters , corresponding to operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 , are applied on each output mode , and photodetection is performed ( preceded by polarizing beamsplitters in order to spatially separate the two polarizations ) . despite the present experimental proposal covers only the case of the real part ( corresponding , as per eq .  </S>",
