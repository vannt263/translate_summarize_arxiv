    "the dqd is defined electrostatically by applying negative voltages to these gates and tuned to the ground state configuration ( 1,1 ) ( one electron per dot ) .",
    "the inhomogeneous field of an on - chip nanomagnet partly lifts the pauli - spin blockade ( detailed in reference @xcite ) and allows lzsm measurements in the most interesting regime where charge and spin qubits can coexist .",
    "here we concentrate on a charge qubit and measure a single - electron - tunneling dc current through the dqd while the voltage on one gate is modulated at radio frequencies ( fig .",

    "it takes into account the nine most relevant energy states for the charge configurations ( 1,0 ) , ( 2,0 ) , ( 1,1 ) , and ( 2,1 ) of the dqd hilbert space , which are the states with chemical potentials lying between or close to those of the source and drain leads .",
    "the hamiltonian includes inter - dot and dot - lead tunneling , inter- and intra - dot coulomb repulsion , zeeman terms stemming from an inhomogeneous magnetic field and the modulation of the on - site energies by applying an rf voltage to one gate . for the coupling to the dissipative environment",
    "we employ a generalized spin - boson model . to describe the periodically driven quantum system we use floquet theory which is based on the ansatz @xmath93 with @xmath94 resembling bloch - functions but with the space coordinate replaced by time , while the quasi - energy @xmath95 corresponds to the quasi - momentum .",
    "we then include the dot - lead tunneling and the action of the dissipating environments within bloch - redfield theory . using the floquet states as basis captures the influence of the rf - field and allows us to treat the resulting master equation within a rotating - wave approximation .",
    "this offers an important computational advantage because finding the steady - state solution is now reduced to solving a linear , time - independent matrix equation , despite the rf driving @xcite .",
    "our experimental results do not indicate any significant temperature dependence of the spin relaxation time ( within the temperature window explored ) .",
    "therefore , we treat the latter in a simplified way using a lindblad form with a phenomenological rate . finally , we identify the current operator : it corresponds to those terms of the master equation describing the incoherent transition @xmath29 , i.e.  the tunneling of electrons from the left dot to the drain lead .",
    "the measured dc current corresponds to the expectation value of the current operator .",

    "in the main article we demonstrated that lzsm interferometry is a viable tool to measure standard qubit properties and , beyond , to determine its coupling to a noisy environment . in our specific case of a dqd charge qubit",
    "we found two main noise sources : ( i ) slow environmental fluctuations resulting in an inhomogeneous gaussian broadening , and ( ii ) the heat bath , resulting in a homogeneous lorentzian broadening . in appendix",

    "further , we detail our quantitative data analysis based on a self - consistent fitting procedure and numerical calculations resulting in the qubit - environment coupling constants , namely the standard deviation @xmath96 of the inhomogeneous broadening and the dimensionless dissipation strength @xmath44 of the coupling to the phonons .    in appendix",
    "[ suppl : model ] we discuss the details of our model for the dqd and its coupling to the leads as well as to the phonons .",
    "moreover , we sketch the bloch - redfield master equation approach by which we compute the asymptotic state of the dqd and the time - averaged current .",
    "this includes a discussion of how we extract the qubit s coherence time @xmath13 from @xmath44 and under which conditions this is an appropriate procedure .",
    "note that we neglect a second component of the electron - phonon coupling , namely @xmath97 which would mainly cause additional energy relaxation between the qubit states .",

    "the finite current within the framed triangle is a consequence of the single - electron tunneling cycle @xmath15 , where the double arrow accounts for the fact that the interdot tunnel coupling is coherent and large compared to the dot - lead tunnel couplings .",
    "the transition @xmath104 thereby divides into @xmath106 and @xmath107 while the coupling between singlet and triplet subspaces is forbidden by the pauli principle .",

    "[ fig : tuning ] , shows two interesting features : ( i ) @xmath14 is strongly suppressed for @xmath108ev , because there the @xmath109 state is beyond the transport window , while the transition @xmath110 is hindered by pauli - spin blockade @xcite , which makes @xmath16 a metastable state . in our case",
    "the spin blockade is partly lifted especially near @xmath80 where the inhomogeneous field of our nanomagnet mixes @xmath16 and @xmath2 ; spin relaxation , provided by the hyperfine interaction with nuclear spins @xcite also contributes , but is weaker .",
    "the strong current increase at @xmath111ev marks the onset of the @xmath109 state contributing to the transport which then completely lifts the spin blockade via the triplet channel @xmath112 .",
    "( ii ) in fig .  [",
    "fig : tuning ] we have , in addition , applied an rf - modulation of @xmath99 at the frequency of 5ghz resulting in a modulation of the detuning with amplitude @xmath113ev .",
    "this gives rise to a pattern of photon assisted tunneling ( pat ) current maxima appearing at @xmath52 with @xmath114 .",

    "we briefly explain how we determine the detuning @xmath20 and the modulation amplitude @xmath37 from gate voltages , the source - drain voltage @xmath120 applied across the dqd and the modulation frequency @xmath39 .",

    "( ii ) the positions of the minima of the current as function of amplitude are also well known ( see e.g.  eq .  ) and we use them to calibrate @xmath125 . at small frequencies , where the interference patterns are less clear , the positions of the outermost current maxima ( at @xmath126 ) framing the region of finite current @xmath92 ( e.g.  in figs .  [ figure2 ] and ) can still be used for a calibration . as the transmission of the rf modulation to the sample depends on the frequency due to cable resonances in the experimental setup , the calibration of @xmath37 has to be done separately for each frequency .",

    "next , we discuss the triplet - singlet coupling , which in our case originates from the hyperfine interaction between the electrons and many nuclei on the one hand and the inhomogeneous magnetic field of our nanomagnet , shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] , on the other hand .",
    "the @xmath16 triplets split into @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "the couplings between @xmath134 and @xmath2 and between @xmath135 and @xmath2 are identical and caused by field inhomogeneities parallel to the effective magnetic field ( approximately parallel to @xmath136mt , see figs .

    "[ fig : couplings ] ) .",
    "next we prepare the dqd in the @xmath2-state at @xmath141 by sweeping the detuning from @xmath142 at a constant speed obeying @xmath143 . during this sweep , the dqd is adiabatically transferred from the @xmath3 to the @xmath2 state while passing the @xmath3-@xmath2 avoided crossing with coupling @xmath82 .",

    "thereby we repeat the same continuously pulsed gate measurements as above but with a short and fixed @xmath160ns so that all passages through the @xmath2-@xmath134 crossing are now equally non - adiabatic while the passage through the @xmath2-@xmath3 crossing is still adiabatic ( see inset of fig .",

    "compared to the measured lzsm patterns , our floquet - bloch - redfield formalism , which already takes into account the realistic electron - phonon coupling @xmath44 ( and the dqd parameters summarized in table [ table ] such as tunnel couplings ) , predicts a much higher visibility of the interference pattern resulting in sharper current maxima .",

    "the longest time scale of our experiment is the dwell time in the dqd of each electron , contributing to the measured current .",
    "it is in the order of @xmath174s , much shorter than the highest frequency components of charge noise . a single shot qubit measurement and hence @xmath13 is , consequently , unlikely to be affected by charge noise .",
    "however , in our steady state experiments each measured data point averages the dc current over @xmath175ms . such an effective time ensemble measurement can be inhomogeneously broadened by charge noise , slow compared to @xmath13 but fast compared to the averaging time . assuming a markovian statistics , this inhomogeneous broadening is well described using a gaussian distribution with standard deviation @xmath45 .      in comparison , determining the dissipation parameter @xmath44 requires considerably more effort , experimentally and even more in theory , where it enters in a rather complex manner .",
    "we follow a route that is based on an idea by rudner _",
    "@xcite , who showed analytically that the fourier transformed @xmath176 of the dc current pattern exhibits a lemon - shaped structure , composed of sinusoidal branches . however , the treatment of ref.@xcite neglects the impact of the tunnel matrix element @xmath82 on the dynamical phase which finally yields an expression similar to our eq .  , but with @xmath177 in its denominator replaced by a phenomenological decay rate  @xmath178 .",
    "thus , the result is a simple lorentzian broadening of width @xmath179 giving rise to an exponential decay , @xmath180 , of the fourier transformed including the lemon structure .",
    "this simplification allows an analytical solution of the problem for the price of limiting our horizon to an unrealistically weak inter - dot tunnel coupling and a convenient but just phenomenologically introduced broadening .",
    "in our dqd we have @xmath181 for all relevant resonances in the whole parameter range measured ; more precisely the interdot tunnel coupling exceeds all broadening mechanisms including the initialization and decay rates , @xmath26 and @xmath28 , but also the broadening caused by environmental influences .",
    "this guaranties a sufficiently long coherence time , @xmath182 , which is a necessary condition for qubit operation as @xmath183 is the qubit clock - speed .",
    "interestingly , the finite @xmath41 in the denominator of eq .   has a direct manifestation in the fourier transformed of the measured lzsm patterns .",

    "our master equation formalism takes into account all these effects and allows us to numerically calculate @xmath92 in the range in which we take our experimental data and compute its two - dimensional discrete fourier transformation . finally , a fourier transformation of our data causes cut - off effects , because both measured and calculated data span only finite ranges in @xmath20 and @xmath37 .",

    "the second feature occurs at very small amplitudes and appears as if the tip of the current triangle was shifted to slightly positive values of @xmath20 .",

    "this resonance is shifted towards positive @xmath209 by dynamic nuclear polarization @xcite .",
    "the fact that the shift only occurs at very small @xmath37 indicates that the continues rf - modulation effectively prevents the polarization of nuclear spins .",

    "the temperature dependence of the lzsm patterns discussed in the main article in the figures [ figure3]c and [ figure4 ] is at the heart of our model as it is used to accurately determine the electron - phonon coupling and finally the qubit coherence time @xmath13 .",
    "so - far we have mostly concentrated on the temperature dependence of the principal lemon arc in the fourier transformed of the lzsm patterns .",

    "our model , therefore , describes the decoherence of the qubit correctly while it predicts an increase of the mean current with temperature that is stronger than in the measurements .",

    "our aim is to compute the lzsm interference patterns using a realistic model and to compare the results with the measured ones .",
    "therefore we need to consider besides our dqd also its coupling to electron source and drain contacts , as well as to environmental fluctuations . in order to realistically describe our measurements , performed in the regime of pauli - spin blockade",
    "which is partly lifted by an inhomogeneous zeeman field of an on - chip nanomagnet , we further include spin relaxation .",
    "our model considers all energetically accessible dqd states and all processes which play a noticeable role in our experiment . comparing our theoretical and experimental data we find two main contributions to a noisy environment :",
    "the first is slow charge noise @xcite and can be described as an inhomogeneous broadening @xmath45 , the second is the heat bath and contributes via the electron - phonon coupling @xmath44 .",
    "it is straightforward to independently extract other relevant system parameters from transport measurements , so that @xmath45 and @xmath44 are the only fit parameters left .",
    "we include the single - particle energies @xmath214 and @xmath215 in the left / right dot , the electron - electron interactions neglecting the small exchange terms , inter - dot tunneling , and the inhomogeneous zeeman field to obtain in second quantization the dqd hamiltonian @xmath216 where @xmath217 is the occupation of dot @xmath218 expressed with the usual fermionic creation and annihilation operators .",
    "the largest energy scales are the intra- and inter - dot coulomb interactions @xmath129 and @xmath130 , which define the diabatic basis states of our charge qubit with energies @xmath219 and @xmath220 and their mutual detuning @xmath221 .",
    "the fourth term describes tunneling between the dots with the matrix element @xmath82 defined such that it equals the energy splitting of the charge qubit formed by the singlets .",
    "the final zeeman term affects the triplet states and , because of the inhomogeneous field contribution of our on - chip magnet , also mixes singlets with triplets .",
    "this mixing enables transitions between singlet and triplet states and may be rather sensitive to thermal exitations @xcite .",
    "if a source - drain voltage is applied across the dqd , it causes a finite average current .",
    "notice that also the hyperfine interaction causes electron spin - flips , which we capture by a phenomenological spin - flip rate  @xmath171 .      to model the single electron tunneling current through the dqd we have to consider its interaction with the two - dimensional leads . starting from the configuration ( 1,0 ) ,",

    "we assume within a wide - band approximation that the spectral density of the source contact is energy independent and find the tunnel coupling @xmath230 is sample dependent and not a priory known ( it can be tuned by gate voltages ) , we have determined the effective dot - lead tunnel couplings , @xmath231 and @xmath232 , experimentally by independent dc - measurements without applying an rf - field .",
    "note that the decay rate used in the main article is @xmath233 , while the initialization rate @xmath26 combines @xmath232 with the singlet - triplet couplings in the last term of the hamiltonian in eq .  .",
    "a central aim of our study is to investigate our two - electron charge qubit and its decoherence , caused by the coupling to a dissipating environment , which is encoded in the lzsm pattern and its visibility .",
    "the details in the experimentally observed fading of the lzsm pattern with increasing temperature reveal two main environmental influences captured by @xmath45 and @xmath44 : the first one is an inhomogeneous broadening most likely caused by slow charge noise ; the second influence is the phonon bath @xcite which yields quantum dissipation and direct decoherence .",
    "another possible decoherence source is the coupling to circuit noise which is important for typically impedance matched superconducting qubits @xcite . in our case , however , we expect this external noise source to be of minor relevance owing to a strong impedance mismatch .    for the inhomogeneous broadening , we assume that it stems from practically temperature independent slow fluctuations of the local potential that remain constant during the typical dwell time of an electron in the dqd",
    ". therefore we can capture these fluctuations by convoluting their amplitude distribution with @xmath92 .    for describing decoherence that stems from the interaction between the dqd and bulk phonons ,",
    "we employ a system - bath approach in the spirit of the caldeira - leggett model for the dissipative two - level system .",
    "this means that we couple the dqd to an ensemble of harmonic oscillators described by the hamiltonian @xmath234 , where @xmath235 and @xmath236 are the usual bosonic creation and annihilation operators for a phonon of frequency @xmath237 .",
    "the position operators of the bath oscillators couple to the occupation difference between the left and the right dot , @xmath238 , according to @xmath239 this electron - phonon coupling hamiltonian describes the interaction of the dqd with environmental degrees of freedom .",
    "its immediate effect is that fluctuations in the environment detune the electronic states which , in turn , results in a randomization of the relative phase in a superposition of states with distinct charge distribution , in particular of the singlets representing our qubit . the latter is therefore subject to decoherence .",
    "an important characteristic of a dissipating bath is its spectral density @xmath240 . as for the leads , we assume also for the phonon bath a continuum limit and replace @xmath241 by the ohmic spectral density @xmath242 .",
    "the dimensionless electron - phonon coupling strength @xmath44 reflects the dissipation strength , which together with the temperature parametrizes the decoherence due to the phonon bath .",
    "the ohmic spectral density represents the natural choice which we have tested by performing additional numerical calculations using super - ohmic spectral densities @xmath243 with @xmath244 , which however failed to reproduce the experimentally observed fading of the lzsm pattern with increasing temperature .",
    "a possible explanation for the good agreement of our data with an ohmic spectral phonon density is the quasi one - dimensional character of the electron - phonon interaction in our dqd sample : decoherence is mainly caused by the one - dimensional subset of phonons with wavevector parallel to the line connecting the two quantum dots . for one - dimensional problems , the ohmic spectral density of the electron - phonon coupling is microscopically justified @xcite .    while @xmath44 couples to the diagonal of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    ", one may in addition consider the off - diagonal coupling term , namely the coupling between phonons and the interdot tunnel barrier .",

    "unlike the bath - coupling via @xmath245 , the bath now entails a fluctuating tunnel matrix element .",

    ", we found a significant asymmetry of the current as function of the detuning , which is in contrast to our experimental results .",
    "the quantitative comparison with our measurements revealed that @xmath97 is roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath44 .",
    "in summary , @xmath97 is of minor relevance for the qubit decoherence and need not be taken into account .",
    "the simplest implementation of a dqd charge qubit is a single electron that tunnels between two dots .",
    "nevertheless , here we consider the more complex case of two electrons charging a dqd .",
    "for the sake of applications , the two - electron state has the important advantage that it allows one to utilize both , charge and spin degrees of freedoms in a single dqd .",
    "this opens up a number of interesting possibilities , such as using either the singlet - singlet or one of the singlet - triplet transitions to define a qubit or even to combine both by subsequently sweeping through adjacent avoided crossings .",
    "furthermore , the two - electron configuration constitutes the simplest possible many - body problem which yields a theoretically more interesting system compared to a single electron . here , we focus on the two singlet states @xmath247 which span the hilbert space of our qubit , where @xmath248 is the uncharged state of the dqd . in this singlet subspace , the double dot hamiltonian defined in eq .",

    "moreover , dealing with two - electron states we have to include spin flips which allow transitions between the triplet and singlet sub - spaces and resolve spin blockade .",
    "our experimental results are consistent with the assumption that all these incoherent processes occur on time scales much larger than those of the coherent dqd dynamics , as is indicated by the following experimental observations : ( i ) the coupling to the leads and the spin relaxation rate ultimately determine the maximal current that we may observe .",
    "the latter is significantly smaller than the inter - dot tunnel frequency multiplied by the elementary charge , i.e. , @xmath271 .",
    "( ii ) charge noise is rather slow as compared to all these tunneling processes .",
    "therefore we can treat it as disorder that is constant during the dwell time of an electron in the dqd .",
    "in other words , it leads to an inhomogeneous broadening that does not affect the decoherence dynamics of the electrons .",
    "( iii ) the appearance of an interference pattern indicates that the inter - dot tunneling must be predominantly coherent which excludes strong coupling to a heat bath .",
    "this is confirmed by our finding that the dimensionless dissipation strength is several orders of magnitude below the crossover to the so - called incoherent tunneling regime @xcite .",
    "we can not a - priory exclude stronger coupling to a small number of individual ( tunneling ) defects , but the fact that we did not find any memory effects makes such a strong coupling scenario unlikely .      to cope with the complex problem outlined above we use a reduced density matrix approach with the floquet states of the driven system in the absence of the environments as basis states .",
    "these basis states already incorporate the rf - modulation and , therefore , allow us to apply a rotating - wave approximation , conveniently resulting in a time independent liouville equation .",
    "this perturbative approach is reliable under the assumption of only weakly coupled environments .",
    "it has been applied in the past to both rf - driven dissipative quantum systems @xcite and rf - driven quantum transport @xcite .",
