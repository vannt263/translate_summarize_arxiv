    "v@xmath1o@xmath2 has been in focus of attention since 1969 when its unusual phase diagram was discovered @xcite . at low temperature ,",
    "pure v@xmath1o@xmath2 is an antiferromagnetic insulator ( afi ) with a monoclinic , slightly distorted corundum structure , a complicated magnetic order , a moment of 1.2@xmath3 and a gap of 0.66ev @xcite . at @xmath4=154k",
    "it transforms to a corundum - structured , paramagnetic metal . upon substituting v by ti or by application of pressure ,",
    "the nel temperature decreases and the antiferromagnetic phase vanishes above 5% ti .",
    "substitution of v by cr , on the other hand , causes the nel temperature to increase and reach 180 k for 1.8% cr . for higher concentrations",
    ", @xmath5 stays constant _ and _ the transition is to a paramagnetic _ insulator .",
    "_ for cr concentrations between 0.5 and 1.8% there is a _ second _ phase transition , which upon increasing temperature , or cr concentration , is from a paramagnetic metal ( pm ) to a paramagnetic insulator ( pi ) .",
    "this transition is isostructural , ends at a critical point , @xmath6 and has been considered the classic example of a mott - hubbard transition .    in the high - temperature corundum structure ( fig .",
    "[ structure ] ) , all vanadium ions are equivalent and surrounded by nearly perfect oxygen octahedra . since the covalent o - v @xmath7 interaction is stronger than the @xmath8 interaction , the more antibonding v@xmath9-like @xmath10 level@xcite lies above the less antibonding v@xmath9-like @xmath0 level and , as a consequence , the electronic configuration of v@xmath1o@xmath2 is v@xmath11 now , the three - fold degenerate @xmath0 level is split into an upper @xmath12 and a lower , doubly degenerate @xmath13 level by a trigonal distortion , which mainly consists of a slight displacement of the vanadium ions along the vertical three - fold axis , away from the centers of their octahedra , so that the distance between a _ vertical vanadium pair _ ( v 4 - 1 or 2- in fig .",
    "[ structure ] ) is slightly longer than the distance between the centers of the two octahedra .",
    "there have been many attempts to explain these metal - insulator transitions and the spin structure of the antiferromagnetic insulating phase .",
    "the careful analysis presented in 1978 by castellani , natoli , and ranninger ( cnr ) @xcite resulted in a model which remained undisputed for over twenty years : since the @xmath12 orbitals have @xmath14 character and point towards each other , yielding a strong @xmath15-like hopping integral , these orbitals on each vertical pair form bonding and antibonding levels which are split by more than twice the @xmath12-@xmath16 crystal - field splitting and by more than the on - site coulomb interaction .",
    "as a consequence , _ one _ electron per vanadium is used to form a spin - singlet , chemical bond between a vertical pair .",
    "the _ other _ electron enters the doubly degenerate , localized @xmath13 orbitals .",
    "since the integrals for hopping from- and between @xmath13 orbitals are relatively small , the on - site coulomb repulsion leads to an @xmath17=1/2 state and may _ order _ the occupied @xmath13 orbitals in a way consistent with the observed spin structure of the low - temperature antiferromagnetic insulator . in this structure , the spins on vanadium pairs in the @xmath18 and @xmath19 directions are aligned ferromagnetically , and those on pairs in the other two directions are aligned antiferromagnetically .",
    "this requires an orbital order in which an integral for hopping in the @xmath19 and @xmath18 directions between occupied @xmath13 orbitals is considerably smaller than between occupied and unoccupied @xmath13 orbitals .",
    "this was reviewed and discussed by rice@xcite using kugel - khomskii s general description @xcite of the coupling between orbital and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the cnr model also led to a half - filled , one - band ( the lowest @xmath16-band ) hubbard hamiltonian to serve as the simplest possible electronic model for v@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "this model was solved by rozenberg _ _ et .",
    "al.__@xcite using the dynamical mean - field approximation ( dmft)@xcite and found to describe the metal - insulator transition . however , the polarized x - ray absorption experiment of park _ et .",
    "@xcite , corroborated with multiplet calculations showed that v 3@xmath20 ions are in the high spin ( @xmath21 ) state rather than in @xmath22 state and the orbital occupation , which is different in different phases , is an admixture of @xmath23 states with @xmath24 configurations . from that , they concluded that neither v@xmath1o@xmath2 problem can be mapped onto a single - band hubbard model , nor the projecting out of @xmath12 orbitals by means of molecular orbital formation as was done by cnr@xcite is justified .",
    "_ s calculations @xcite within the local density approximation ( lda)+u scheme showed the importance of hund s rule exchange giving rise to @xmath21 model but with only @xmath25 occupancy implying no orbital ordering . however , they succeeded in correctly predicting the low - temperature magnetic structure which was attributed to be stabilized by the monoclinic distortion . nevertheless , the issue associated with the orbital ordering remained which apparently showed up its presence in several different experimental observations @xcite . to reconcile the @xmath21 and the orbital ordering aspect , mila _ et .",
    "_ @xcite and di matteo _ et .",
    "@xcite subsequently proposed two different correlated model of @xmath26 pair states incorporating dynamical mixing of @xmath23 and @xmath24 states with @xmath21 spin configuration on each of the sites . in recent years ,",
    "combined with the lda , dmft calculations have been carried out@xcite .",
    "while , it is now generally accepted , a realistic theory of v@xmath1o@xmath2 must take into account the complicated electronic structure of the system , there has been no serious attempt to realistic modeling of the electronic structure of v@xmath1o@xmath2 since the early work of cnr@xcite which was crude in its various approximations and was partly semi - empirical .",
    "the starting point of several of the many - body model - based calculations seem to be the vertical v - v pair model which is considered to be the predominant building blocks @xmath27 the validity of such assumptions need to be re - examined in the context of accurate tight - binding ( tb ) modeling of v@xmath1o@xmath2 .    in recent years mto",
    "based @xmath28 order mto method , namely _ n_mto",
    "method@xcite has been introduced and implemented .",
    "the method goes beyond the scope of the standard linear mto ( lmto ) method , in defining an energetically accurate basis set with a consistent description throughout the space of mt spheres and the interstitial .",
    "an important feature of the _ n_mto method is the so - called _ downfolding _ technique which provides an useful way to derive few - orbital hamiltonians starting from complicated full lda hamiltonian by integrating out degrees of freedom not - of - interest .",
    "this procedure naturally takes into account the renormalization effect due of the integrated - out orbitals by defining energy - selective , effective orbitals which serve as the wannier or wannier - like orbitals for the few - orbital hamiltonian in _ downfolded _ representation .",
    "the method provides a first - principles way of deriving the single - particle model hamiltonian and direct generation of wannier functions without any fitting procedure giving rise to an unique scheme that has the deterministic nature of first - principles calculations added to the simplicity of model hamiltonian approaches .",
    "the method has proved to be extremely successful in deriving model hamiltonians for systems such as high - tc cuprates @xcite , double perovskites @xcite , low - dimensional quantum spin systems @xcite .",
    "this approach of direct generation of wannier functions may be contrasted to that of construction of wannier functions out of the calculated bloch functions .",
    "recently anisimov _ et al .",
    "_ implemented a similar method for use in lda+dmft @xcite and solovyev proposed a general lmto - based procedure for constructing effective lattice fermion modelssolovyev06 . with other local - orbital basis sets ,",
    "somewhat similar techniques can be used @xcite , but in case not all basis functions are well localized , e.g. for the set of bare lmtos@xcite , the wannier functions obtained for the correlated bands may not be sufficently localized for the corresponding on - site-@xmath29-hamiltonian to be realistic . for those cases , more complicated procedures for obtaining for instance those wannier functions which minimize the spread,@xcite @xmath30 or those which maximize the coulomb self - energy , has been used.@xcite    in this paper , we aim to provide an accurate tight - binding description of v@xmath1o@xmath2 by constructing the wannier - like functions for the @xmath0 hamiltonian employing the _ n_mto methodology . in this context",
    ", this methodology has recently been applied @xcite for tight - binding modeling of @xmath12 bands of ferromagnetic lda+u calculations to investigate the role of vertical pair from band - structure point of view . in those specific calculations ,",
    "primary interest was to estimate the @xmath26 intra - pair hopping matrix element compared to inter - pair hopping matrix elements for @xmath12 bands and therefore , lda+u rather than lda was chosen as the basis of calculations , which provides nice separation of @xmath12 and @xmath25 bands . however , from point of view of input to realistic many - body calculations it is more suitable and preferable to start with lda - derived hamiltonians and the full @xmath0 hamiltonian since the @xmath12 and @xmath25 states are both equally important as seen in experiment and the hybridization effect between @xmath12 and @xmath25 should be taken in account .",
    "in the present work , we have therefore chosen lda as the basis of our calculations . the present paper in that respect ,",
    "should be considered as a more detail paper for the tight - binding modeling of v@xmath1o@xmath31 system .",
    "the tight - binding parameters derived in this paper in a rigorous , first - principles manner will be useful as an input to many - body variational calculation like that of di matteo _ et .",
    "@xcite as will be discussed in section iii d. the parameters can also be used for the many - body lda+dmft calculations . the lda+dmft calculations report in ref .",
    "@xcite , has been carried out using the _ n_mto wannier function implementation of lda , presented in this paper .",
    "these calculations@xcite showed the importance of correlation assisted dehybridization of @xmath12 and @xmath25 in the description of the correlated electronic structure of v@xmath1o@xmath31 and its metal - insulator transition .",
    "calculations within such lda+dmft framework has been also used to explore the comparison of doping , temperature and pressure route to metal - insulator transition in v@xmath1o@xmath31@xcite and to study multi - orbital effects in optical properties of v@xmath1o@xmath2@xcite .    in the following , in section",
    "ii we discuss the crystal structure and orbital symmetry aspects in v@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "section iii involves description of the results and discussion .",
    "this section is divided into several sub - sections . in the sub - section",
    "a we present the high - energy part of the lda band - structure of rhombohedral , undoped v@xmath1o@xmath2 in ambient pressure . in the sub - section b we explain how downfolding within the _ n_mto method can be used to construct truly minimal basis sets which pick out selectively o-@xmath32 , v-@xmath0 , v@xmath10 or v-@xmath33 bands .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , the high temperature paramagnetic phase of v@xmath1o@xmath2 has the corundum structure .",

    "the immediate surrounding of the v atoms provided by oxygen atoms has approximate octahedral symmetry .",

    "the nearest - neighbor v - v distances within the hexagonal layers are 2.882 @xmath38 while that along the vertical direction is about 6 @xmath42 shorter ( 2.697 @xmath38 ) . as is evident from the structural figure as well as from the internal parameter value ,",
    "the v atoms are displaced from their _ ideal _ positions where v atoms in the hexagonal layers would have been co - planer .",
    "this displacement causes v atoms to move away from the center of the octehedra , giving rise to three long and three short v - o bonds .",
