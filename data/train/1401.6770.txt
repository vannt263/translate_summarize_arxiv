    "the concept of edge states dates back to tamm @xcite who pointed out in 1932 that the energy levels of a crystal can give birth to `` surface states '' where electrons are localized along the crystal surface .",
    "subsequent studies of the issue were carried out by different authors @xcite till late 1930 s .",
    "the physics of edge states acquired new life in last decades due to the progress in fabrication of low - dimensional electron structures and novel materials .",
    "current carrying edge states play decisive role in the formation of integer @xcite and fractional @xcite quantum hall states observed in gaas heterostructures , oxides heterostructures @xcite and in graphene @xcite .",
    "interest in physics of edge states has been considerably heated up by the discovery of topological insulators @xcite .",
    "these are systems with insulating bulk and topologically protected conducting edge states ( see ref .",
    "[ 20 ] for recent review )",
    ". one can exemplify other physical systems e.g. optical lattices @xcite and photonic crystals @xcite where the edge states do emerge .",
    "edge states were usually studied in 2d lattice electron systems and within the framework of tight - binding models @xcite , though the dirac equation approaches have been also carried out @xcite ( see ref .",
    "[ 28 - 30 ] for more mathematical treatment ) .",
    "after seminal theoretical papers by fujita et al .",
    "@xcite it became clear that edges have strong impact on the low - energy electronic structure and electronic transport properties of nanometer - sized graphene ribbons @xcite .",
    "because edge states substantially determine infrared transport and magnetic properties of graphene nanoribbons , considerable efforts were devoted during the last decade to studying the effect of edges in graphitic nanomaterials ( see ref . [ 35 ] for review ) .",
    "synthesis of two - dimensional boron nanoribbons with triangular crystal structure has been reported recently @xcite .",
    "theoretical estimates show that monolayers of a boron built up of triangular and hexagonal structural elements are energetically more stable than the flat triangular sheets @xcite",
    ". therefore general perception of a monolayer boron sheet is that it occurs as a buckled sheet with triangular and hexagonal components . as a result electronic band structure of boron nanoribbons with mixed structure",
    "has become the subject of subsequent theoretical and numerical analysis @xcite while the edge states in pure triangular ribbons have not been studied in details .    in this paper",
    "we consider tight - binding models of free electrons living on two - dimensional square and triangular lattice ribbons . in the case of square - lattice ribbon electron delocalization process",
    "is characterized by four different hopping parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , while in the case of triangular - lattice ribbon  by three different hopping parameters @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 parameterising hoppings along the three linear directions on the triangular lattice .    in section 2 we study the square - lattice ribbon . for the particular regimes of hopping parameters the hamiltonian under consideration is reduced to that of an electron on a honeycomb ribbon with either zigzag or armchair edges . for these physically important sets of hopping amplitudes",
    "we solve the eigenvalue problem exactly and express the solutions in terms of chebyshev polynomials . in the case of zigzag boundaries we reproduce the flat band of edge states @xcite .",
    "inclusion of hopping anisotropy allows to trace out the corresponding response of the system .",
    "in particular , we show that the formation of edge states depends on strength of anisotropy and may not occur at all if the anisotropy between certain directions is sufficiently strong .    in section 3 we deal with triangle - lattice ribbons .",
    "we consider three different options for edge configurations and solve the diagonalization problems in terms of chebyshev polynomials .",
    "prior attention is paid to the occurrence of edge states and the corresponding necessary conditions on hopping parameters are found .",
    "results are summarized in section 4 .",
    "calculational details are collected in appendix .",
    "in this section we consider electrons on a square lattice shown in fig . 1 with four different hopping amplitudes @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "the lattice is finite in @xmath7-direction comprising of @xmath8 one - dimensional chains , and infinite in @xmath9-direction . in response to the particular hopping anisotropy the lattice",
    "is considered as consisting of two bravais sublattices labeled by @xmath10 .",
    "integers @xmath11 and @xmath12 parameterize the unit cell indicated by dashed area in fig",
    "-periodic with periodicity @xmath13 . ]",
    "the tight - binding hamiltonian appears as @xmath14+\\nn\\\\ & + t_d\\sum_m\\sum_{n=1}^n\\big[c^\\dag_\\circ(n , m-1)c^{}_\\bullet(n , m)+h.c.\\big]+\\nn\\\\ & + t_r\\sum_m\\sum_{n=1}^{n-1}\\big[c^\\dag_\\circ(n+1,m)c^{}_\\bullet(n , m)+h.c.\\big]+\\nn\\\\ & + t_l\\sum_m\\sum_{n=2}^{n}\\big[c^\\dag_\\circ(n-1,m-1)c^{}_\\bullet(n , m)+h.c.\\big]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are electron creation and annihilation operators .",
    "note that the terms with @xmath17 and @xmath18 are absent in third and fourth terms of ( 1 ) respectively .",
    "this reflects the absence of hoppings away beyond the boundaries .",
    "separation between the nearest sites is @xmath19 , and the lattice is periodic in @xmath9-direction with the period @xmath13 , hence we employ the fourier transform in @xmath9-direction c^_(n , m)=_bze^+ik(2a)mc^_,n(k)dk where the length of the brillouin zone is @xmath20 .    introducing @xmath21 and @xmath22 we rewrite the hamiltonian ( 1 ) as h=^(k)h(k)(k)dk h=0 & t +   + t^ & 0where t = t_u+t_de^+2ika+t_r^+t_le^+2ika . here",

    "the eigenvalue equation for @xmath25 leads to the system of entangled equation @xmath26    we consider three cases when this entanglement becomes soluble .    instead of @xmath27 one may consider @xmath28 where the entanglement is absent",
    "however , the linear combination of @xmath23 and @xmath29 involved in ( 7 ) is a tri - diagonal matrix .",
    "consequently , the matrices appearing in @xmath30 are penta - diagonal and lead to five - term recurrence relations for the components of @xmath31 and @xmath32 . taking @xmath33",
    "the penta - diagonal form of @xmath30 turns into tri - diagonal one and the equation @xmath28 gives out three - term recurrence relation which appears soluble in terms of chebyshev polynomials .",
    "switching off the @xmath2-hoppings in fig .",

    "this case can be reduced further to a honeycomb with armchair edges by taking @xmath35 as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "we study zero modes ( @xmath37 ) in the anisotropic square lattice . in that case",
    "the system ( 7 ) trivially decouples into two independent equations each of three - term recurrence form .",
    "we consider these three options separately in the following subsections .      for @xmath33",
    "the square ribbon is topologically equivalent to a honeycomb with zigzag edges .",
    "the eigenvalue system ( 7 ) takes the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 .    squared system appears as @xmath41 and the two equations can be solved independently .    in the matrix form",
    "these appear as @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44",

    "3 depicts @xmath45 versus @xmath53 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 .    employing the technique described in appendix we solve ( 10a ) and ( 10b ) separately and",

    "3 is bounded from three sides by @xmath61 and @xmath62 , which imply that in the interior of this area we have -1 + 1 . denoting @xmath63 we use the relation u_n(v)=. this allows to write the eigenstates ( 12 ) as @xmath64}{\\sin v}+\\frac{\\sin[(n-1)v]}{|\\xi|\\hh\\sin",

    "consequently , none of the states represented by the interior of shaded area can be localized at boundaries ( @xmath18 and @xmath17 ) .",
    "these are all bulk states .    differentiating ( 11 )",
    "we find = where we used @xmath66 and @xmath67 together with ( 11 ) .    from ( 17 )",
    "it follows that the extrema of subbands ( numerator vanishes ) are located along the ellipsis set by ^2+||^2=1 .    alongside with the extrema there is an extra point ( indicated in bold ) where the ellipsis intersects the energy bands .",
    "as shown in the next subsection this represents the edge - bulk transition points , and the subbands located beyond the shaded area are edge states .",
