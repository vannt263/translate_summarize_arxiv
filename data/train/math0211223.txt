    "in 1833 carl friedrich gauss , in his investigation of electromagnetic theory , discovered an integral formula for the linking number of two space curves . if @xmath0 and @xmath1 are disjoint embeddings of @xmath2 into @xmath3 i.e two disjoint space curves , and if @xmath4 is the map that assigns to each @xmath5 the unit vector from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , with @xmath8 defined as the volume form on @xmath9 , the gauss integral is @xmath10 it is natural to ask what happens if we take @xmath0 to equal @xmath1 , in other words if we want to find a knot invariant analogous to the linking number of a two component link .",
    "but in the case of a knot we run into the problem that @xmath11 is not defined ( how do we define the direction from a point to itself ? ) .",
    "so rather than @xmath12 being a function from @xmath13 to @xmath9 it is instead a function from @xmath14 ( the configuration space of two points on @xmath2 ) to @xmath9 .",
    "the natural way to transport the gauss integral to the case of a knot is then @xmath15 the problem now is that since @xmath16 is not a compact space , we are not guaranteed that the integral converges .",
    "there are two ways that we might try to solve this problem .       1",
    ".   we could compactify the configuration space , and examine by how much @xmath17 ` fails ' to be invariant . by stokes theorem",
    ", we find that this quantity depends on the boundary of the compactified configuration space .",
    "we seek to eliminate this boundary by pasting some extra discs @xmath18 and @xmath19 onto our space , thus renormalizing the integral .",
    "our invariant will then be @xmath17 plus a correction term which will depend on a `` swaddling '' map @xmath20 , the extension of @xmath12 to the extra discs @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the invariant thus constructed will depend on the initial curve and on a choice of a * homotopy class for the swaddling map @xmath20*. 2 .",
    "we may look at the linking number of two copies of the knot , when the second copy is `` pushed off '' to a distance of @xmath21 from the first copy , and calculate what happens as @xmath22 .",
    "but this linking number will depend on * which direction * we decided to push off the second copy of the knot in relation to the first copy at each point , which implicitly specifies a knot framing .",
    "as @xmath23 , the limit will not necessarily be an integer , forcing the introduction of a framing dependant correction term which will turn out to be the total holonomy of the curve .",
    "the invariant thus constructed will depend on the initial curve , along with a choice of * framing * for it .",
    "it is not at all clear at first what these two constructions should have to do with one another .",
    "the aim of this note is to present both approaches in a clear and accessible fashion , and to showing how they relate in basic differential geometric terms .",
    "we are not trying to say anything new per se , but rather to present definitions , facts , and proofs most of which are well known , at least as folklore , in a simple and accessible format .",
    "the importance of the self - linking integral is that it is the most simple and basic example of presentation of a vassiliev invariant as a configuration space integral .",
    "moreover , as the work of bott and taubes @xcite ( see also @xcite ) shows , this integral plays a basic role as a correction term for anomalies in the definition of more general finite - type `` self - linking invariants '' . in this regard , this invariant constitutes a basic ingredient in the understanding of the chern - simons invariants of knot theory .",
    "the first effective ` renormalization ' of the gauss integral by adding a correction term was carried out by calugareanu @xcite , and later by pohl @xcite in the case of a closed space curve with nowhere vanishing torsion .    who the first person was to extend the invariant to curves that may have a non - vanishing torsion i do not know .",
    "the ` holonomy ' construction ( the second method above ) appears the more common , and is used for instance by polyakov @xcite ( see also tze @xcite ) , by bott and taubes @xcite and by bar - natan @xcite",
    ". meanwhile , the swaddling construction ( the first method mentioned above ) is preferred by dylan thurston @xcite and appears more recently in papers by poirier ( @xcite and by lescop @xcite .",
    "the poirier paper also gives a brief explanation for the equivalence between the two constructions ( @xcite , remark 6.17 ) .",
    "i would like to thank prof .",
    "dror bar - natan , who had the idea for this paper , and who helped me enormously at every stage of getting it written .",
    "i also wish to thank tomotada ohtsuki for his many helpful suggestions , emanuel farjoun for his generous help with the topological side of things , and raymond lickorish for his helpful comments .",
    "our problem when attempting to transport the gauss self - linking integral to knots is what to do about points of the form @xmath24 , for which the gauss map is not defined .",
    "we can not simply ignore them , since this would force us to integrate over the space @xmath16 which is not compact , so that the gauss integral would not be guaranteed to converge .",
    "if we want to find an invariant based on the concept of self - linking , we have no choice but to extend the gauss function to points of the form @xmath24 in some way .",
    "the problem is that as points in @xmath16 approach points on the diagonal , the gauss map has two limits the forward and the backward sweeping tangents .",
    "let us define @xmath25 , a compactification of @xmath16 , by pasting two copies of the diagonal , @xmath26 and @xmath27 to its missing diagonal @xmath28 , as shown in the diagram below .",
    "@xmath29     points on @xmath26 , which are limits of the form @xmath30 , shall be denoted @xmath31 , with points on @xmath27 correspondingly denoted @xmath32 . at these boundaries of @xmath16 ,",
    "the gauss map converges to the tangent vector to the curve , sweeping either forwards or backwards depending on whether its input converges to a point in @xmath26 or to a point in @xmath27 .",
    "this allows us to solve the problem of how to extend the gauss map to the diagonal .",
    "@xmath12 can be extended smoothly to a function @xmath33 , defined as @xmath34 on the boundary .",
    "let @xmath35 be a one parameter family of curves .",
    "for @xmath36 , let us define @xmath37 invariance of @xmath38 means that @xmath39 for all @xmath40 .",
    "but :    @xmath41    the first equality holds because @xmath42 and @xmath43 commute , and since @xmath8 is a 2-form defined on a 2-manifold , @xmath44 .",
    "the second equality is the stokes theorem .",
    "the third equality is simply the fact that @xmath45 .    from ( 2.2 )",
    ", we learn that @xmath46 if and only if @xmath47 .",
    "but we have no reason to assume that this would generally be the case .",
    "let us then `` cap off '' the cylinder @xmath48 by pasting two @xmath49 s to it , making it isomorphic to @xmath9 , as shown in the illustration below .",
    "let us define a `` swaddling '' map @xmath20 as a continuous map which wraps @xmath9 in @xmath49 such that on the boundary @xmath50 .",
    "in our case we have two such maps , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath53 maps the boundaries of @xmath48 in `` antipodally'' i.e. if @xmath54 maps to @xmath55 , @xmath56 maps to @xmath57 .",
    "let us now define @xmath51 as a map that maps the border of a disc to @xmath58 , with the sign corresponding to that of @xmath59 , and @xmath52 to be @xmath60 . by abuse of notation ,",
    "let us now define our total map @xmath20 as the difference between these two maps .",
    "our correction term will then be defined by the equation @xmath61 the motivation for this is that just like with @xmath40 , invariance of @xmath62 means that @xmath63 for all @xmath40 . but : @xmath64 so @xmath62 is `` at a distance '' of @xmath65 from being invariant .",
    "we have found that @xmath66 , proving the following :    @xmath67 is an invariant of ordered pairs of a knot and an integer specifying the homotopy class for the map @xmath20 .",
    "indeed , a simple stokes theorem argument shows that for two homotopic @xmath20 s give us the same @xmath62 ( we can push the difference to the boundary , where the two @xmath20 s will coincide ) .",
    "moreover , our new invariant assumes integer values , because @xmath20 wraps the disc around @xmath9 a whole number of times ( it has to , since @xmath68 , and so @xmath69 assumes values in @xmath70 ) .",
    "thus we find that @xmath71 ( the `` self - linking number '' of @xmath40 ) is an integer - valued invariant of closed space curves along with a choice of homotopy class of swaddling maps @xmath20 .",
    "but just how much information are we adding about the knot when we specify a homotopy class for a swaddling map ?      in passing , we may note that for a curve with nowhere vanishing curvature , @xmath62 corresponds to the notion of the correction term for the self - linking number as it was first defined by calugareanu and later by pohl , as the total torsion of a space curve . in section 2.4",
    ", we discovered that the correction term @xmath62 is equal , modulo @xmath72 , to the area on @xmath73 covered by the map @xmath20 .",
    "by the gauss - bonnet theorem , this is equal to the total curvature of @xmath74 .",
    "but if @xmath40 has nowhere vanishing curvature , then this equals simply the total torsion of the space curve @xmath40 .",
    "in the previous section , we transported the concept of a linking number from links to knots by compactifying the configuration space and pasting pieces onto it in order to `` force '' the gauss integral to converge and to give us an invariant . there is another way to approach the problem however .",
    "we already know that the linking number is a link invariant well then , let s pretend that our knot is a link ! if we take two copies of our knot that are only an @xmath21 apart , and then see what happens when @xmath21 goes to zero , we may utilize the known invariance of the linking number for links in order to directly conjure up an invariant for knots .    in the approach we are now taking , we have one ` stationary ' curve , which we shall label @xmath0 , for which we choose a smooth framing @xmath75 .",
    "we then take the curve obtained made up of points @xmath76 for @xmath77 , with @xmath78 , which we shall denote @xmath79 .",
    "now we let the ` mobile ' @xmath1 descent towards the ` stationary ' @xmath0 .",
    "what we want to know is what happens the self - linking integral when they touch .",
    "the classical approach here is to take the limit as @xmath80 of the gauss integral , which involves writing and partially calculating an explicit integral .",
    "this leads us to what physicists call the ` point - splitting regularization integral ' .",
    "tze @xcite quotes a ` simplified approach ' which he credits to anshelevich , as quoted in an article about the twisting of strands of dna @xcite ( ! ) , which leads to the conclusion that the correction term must @xmath81 times the total holonomy of the curve .",
    "but the same result may be obtained in a more elementary way by making use of a technique we have already used that of a ` swaddling map ' .",
    "this will also help us to visualize why and when the two constructions for the error term of the self - linking integral will coincide .",
    "rather than thinking of limits of integrals , let s compactify the space of pairs @xmath82 by pasting something onto the boundary @xmath83 , where the overline denotes topological closure .",
    "our problem , as usual , is that @xmath11 is not defined , and what this second approach gives is a way of defining it via a limit which keeps track of the information which is relevant to the gauss integral direction and thus tells us what it wants @xmath11 to be .",
    "thus , the space we must paste on should consist of pairs @xmath84 in which we store the `` address '' @xmath85 of the point , as well as the direction from which @xmath85 is coming in on @xmath79 .",
    "we may depict the newly created boundary of our compactified space as a continuum of pieces which can be schematically depicted like this :    @xmath86    the leftmost point of the semicircle corresponds to a point @xmath87 coming in to @xmath88 on a backward sweeping tangent , the rightmost one corresponds to the point coming in on a forward sweeping tangent , and the apex corresponds to the point coming in straight off the normal .",
    "the tangent and the normal at each point define the framing for the knot , so that we see that we have not lost any information .",
    "let us define @xmath89    our main claim in this section is :    @xmath90 is an invariant of framed knots .    to see that @xmath90 is in fact the limit of the integral of the pullback of the volume form , note that the domain at every @xmath91 where @xmath21 is fixed is cobordant to the integral at ` the bottom ' , where @xmath92 , and hence via a standard stokes theorem argument",
    ", the `` point - splitting regularization integral '' used by @xcite is the same as the integral along @xmath93 .",
    "let us eliminate the boundary of our configuration space this time in a different way rather than pasting two discs onto the @xmath48 boundary , let us instead paste another @xmath48 to it ( which we shall call @xmath94 for cylinder ) , completing the cylinder @xmath16 to a torus @xmath95 as shown in the illustration below :    @xmath96     then we define a new swaddling map @xmath97 which maps the boundaries of @xmath94 to the curves @xmath58 in such a way that @xmath53 and @xmath98 combine to give us a continuous map @xmath99 .    as the title to this section suggests , we would like to show that in 3.1.1 and in 3.1.2 we have done one and the same thing ( modulo @xmath100) that in point of fact , there is no difference between compactifying the space as in section 3.1.1 . by storing framing information on the boundary , and between eliminating the boundary of @xmath25 by the `` @xmath94-swaddling '' method as we have done in this section .      the integral on the bottom splits into two parts the `` normal '' pieces in which we have just the standard gauss self - linking integral , and the `` bumps '' .",
    "on the bumps , @xmath101 goes from the tangent to the normal to minus the tangent i.e. it traces out the image of a line between two points of the form @xmath102 , @xmath103 on @xmath48 , thus defining a @xmath94-swaddling , as the path can be assumed to be a great circle for all point on the knot .",
    "we thus see that the `` @xmath94-swaddling '' construction gives us @xmath104 , in just the same way as the construction in the first section gave us @xmath62 .",
    "the fact that every @xmath94-swaddling gives a framing follows from the following lemma .    [ e : matz ] every @xmath94-swaddling map is homotopic via @xmath94-swaddling maps to a map in which the path on @xmath9 from @xmath105 to @xmath106 for each @xmath107 in the knot is a great circle between the two points .    1 .",
    "every @xmath94-swaddling map is homotopic to a boundary - fixing diffeomorphisms from the cylinder to itself composed with a mapping from the cylinder to @xmath9 taking the boundaries of the cylinder to @xmath74 and to @xmath108 and mapping the line @xmath109 , @xmath110 to a great circle from @xmath105 to @xmath106 for each @xmath111 .",
    "let us fix the second map in this composition and call it @xmath112 .",
    "by @xcite there is a @xmath72-worth of boundary - preserving diffeomorphisms of the cylinder @xmath113 to itself up to homotopy by such diffeomorphisms .",
    "the generator of the this homotopy group is a dehn twist about a boundary - parallel curve .",
    "2 .   let @xmath114 be the image of @xmath115 in the @xmath9 under a power of the generator which we found in step 1 .",
    "let @xmath116 be a disc in @xmath9 of radius @xmath21 centred at the image of @xmath117 .",
    "the homotopy which fixes @xmath118 and @xmath119 and revolves @xmath120 in a full circle around @xmath121 for all @xmath111 undoes the dehn twist . + concretely , let s look at @xmath122 @xmath123 which takes @xmath114 to a smoothing of the curve obtained by taking a radius of @xmath116 at angle @xmath124 , then travelling around the circumference of @xmath116 clockwise until we hit @xmath114 and continuing with @xmath114 .",
    "@xmath125 can be taken by homotopy to a curve in the image of the cylinder on @xmath9 , which is @xmath114 with a dehn twist added .",
    "thus for each mapping @xmath112 considered in step 1 , the map from the cylinder has a single representative @xmath112 composed with the identity .",
    "there are a @xmath72-worth of choices of @xmath112 , corresponding to taking the path on the cylinder from @xmath126 , @xmath110 , to the great circle which wraps around the circle @xmath127 times for all @xmath128 .",
    "choosing the midpoint for each such great circle gives us a normal to the knot at @xmath107 .",
    "in other words , given a family of forward - sweeping tangents to the knot , a @xmath94-swaddling map gives us a smooth family of normals to the knot , thus giving the knot a framing .      to show that the correction term @xmath104 that we get is the total holonomy ,",
    "we must first represent @xmath129 as the pullback of an element of @xmath130 .",
    "for this purpose , as the @xmath98 swaddling map is a smooth extension of the gauss map , let us redefine @xmath131 to be @xmath132 when @xmath133 and @xmath98 on the boundary .      since we are now moving into so(3 )",
    ", we shall convert the discussion into the language of framings .",
    "let us break @xmath131 into the mapping @xmath98 from @xmath2 to @xmath130 composed on a mapping @xmath134 from @xmath130 to @xmath9 .",
    "following @xcite , let @xmath135 be the unit vector normal to @xmath136 on the plane spanned by @xmath136 and the tangent , extending smoothly to the normal defined by @xmath98 on the boundary .",
    "we shall then define @xmath137 to be @xmath138 at every point .",
    "the following lemma is due to william pohl @xcite .",
    "@xmath139    for every @xmath140 in @xmath141 , @xmath142 defines a function @xmath143 by means of the relation @xmath144 for any vector @xmath145 , when @xmath146 denoted the restriction of @xmath142 to the point @xmath147 .",
    "the volume form in @xmath148 is then given by the expression @xmath149    let us pull back the volume form via @xmath136 .",
    "@xmath150 , therefore @xmath151 by leibnitz s rule .",
    "there was nothing special about our choice of 0 as the point by which to define the functions @xmath143 , therefore we have @xmath152 .",
    "but @xmath153 , and by differentiating this equality we find that @xmath154 and so this equals @xmath155    now we remember that the @xmath156 s are an orthonormal to one another , and therefore they satisfy the equality @xmath157    but according to ( 3.1 ) this is exactly @xmath158 , and so we have found that @xmath159      in @xmath40 has nowhere vanishing curvature , we can use lemma ( 3.2 ) to show that this correction term as well is equal to the total torsion of the curve @xmath40 .",
    "here @xmath136 is the tangent , @xmath135 the normal , and @xmath137 the binormal , so @xmath160 @xmath161 , so by the frenet equations , @xmath162 so @xmath163 .",
    "thus , we see that for a curve with a nowhere - vanishing curvature , @xmath164 which is again the total torsion of the space curve @xmath40 .",
    "the last step of our argument is just the stokes theorem .",
    "the domain of @xmath165 is our `` cylinder compactification '' of @xmath16 . pulling back the volume form via this map , when restricted to @xmath94",
    ", will then by stokes theorem be equivalent to pulling back @xmath166 via @xmath98 along @xmath94 s boundary .",
    "but here @xmath98 gives us the tangent , @xmath135 the normal , and @xmath137 the binormal , @xmath167 is the triple product @xmath168 . here",
    "though we have @xmath169 .",
    "the last integral is measuring `` by how far '' the normal has strayed from its initial position at @xmath170 by the time we get to @xmath171 . in other words , @xmath104 is measuring the * total holonomy * of the curve @xmath40 , with respect to the reimannian connection on the normal bundle to the curve .      here",
    "again we have an easy proof that the correction term of the self - linking integral equals the total torsion .",
    "when our curve has a frenet frame @xmath172 with curvature @xmath173 and torsion @xmath174 , the frenet equations give us @xmath175",
    "in the previous sections , we have presented two alternative ways of introducing a correction term to the gauss self - linking integral for a knot , making it an invariant . we do not know yet whether these two methods are equivalent , and there is no reason a priori to assume that this should be the case .",
    "why should choosing a homotopy class for a swaddling map have anything to do with choosing a framing for a knot ? in both of these approaches ,",
    "we reach the image on @xmath9 via the gauss map of the tangent bundle to an embedding into @xmath3 of @xmath2 , but in the first approach we come to this image by first embedding @xmath2 into @xmath49 and then getting to @xmath9 via the swaddling map @xmath20 , while in the second approach we first map to @xmath130 by choosing a framing ( we shall call this map @xmath98 ) , and then map down from there onto @xmath9 .",
    "the situation is schematically depicted in the commutative diagram below :    @xmath176_(.6)\\beta & & so(3 ) \\ar[d]^{e_{1 } } \\\\ s^{1 } \\ar@{^{(}->}[u ] \\ar[rr]_{\\dot{\\gamma } } \\ar[urr]^(.6)\\phi & & s^{2}}\\ ] ]    in this notation , @xmath177 , while @xmath178 for @xmath174 a pre - image of omega via the map @xmath136",
    ". equality of these terms would follow from the existence of a map @xmath179 such that the following diagram commutes :    @xmath176_(.6)\\beta \\ar@{-->}[rr]^\\sigma & & so(3 ) \\ar[d]^{e_{1 } } \\\\ s^{1 } \\ar@{^{(}->}[u ] \\ar[rr]_{\\dot{\\gamma } }   \\ar[urr]^(.6)\\phi & & s^{2}}\\ ] ] for in that case @xmath180 the second equality stems from the fact that the diagram is commutative , and the fourth we have already shown .",
    "so all the action takes place around the middle equality .",
    "we have shown that when @xmath181 is transported to so(3 ) , it becomes the @xmath42 of something .",
    "so we may use stokes theorem to go from left to right .",
    "we can also see this easily from the swaddling map construction- let us choose a @xmath20 mapping , pasting two discs onto the boundaries of @xmath16 , making it a compact space .",
    "let us choose our discs such that corresponding points on @xmath19 and on @xmath18 map to antipodal points on @xmath9 via @xmath20 .",
    "cutting out a small neighbourhood of the centres of the discs , we may glue a cylinder between them , connecting them into a shape isomorphic to the cylinder on which our @xmath98 map was defined .",
    "now every @xmath20 map can be smoothly extended to a @xmath179 map , because the two discs with the narrow tube connecting them is homotopically a cylinder .",
    "but as tahl novik observed , going from right to left in this set of equalities we have to watch out , because @xmath182 , and for a path belonging to the non - trivial homotopy class of @xmath130 , there can exist no pre - image via a @xmath179 mapping .",
    "let us note that the cylinder of the @xmath94-swaddling construction can be ` cut ' into 2 discs if and only if it is homotopic to a cylinder of which the ` middle circle ' is constant- in other words as a framing it is homotopic to the constant framing . then and",
    "only then can we ` pinch closed ' that sphere , turning the cylinder into two discs tangent at a point without loss of information . for elements of the non - trivial homotopy class ,",
    "this is by definition going to be impossible .",
    "notice that by ` pinching ' the cylinder into discs , we are separating the backward sweeping tangents and the forward sweeping tangents , which is impossible in the non - trivial homotopy class in which these two families of tangent vectors are one and the same .",
    "but for elements of the trivial homotopy class of @xmath130 , no such difficulty arises .",
    "stokes theorem takes us from @xmath183 to @xmath184 .",
    "we have proved then the following theorem :    @xmath185    the `` @xmath186 '' correction is an idea of tomotada ohtsuki s , to remind us that for ` minimal ' representatives of @xmath98 and @xmath20 the area @xmath98 covers on @xmath9 with the cylinder @xmath94 ( in this case ` minimal ' would be taken to mean that each `` vertical '' line between the boundaries of the cylinder is mapped to the minimal length line between the tangent and minus the tangent on @xmath9 , with appropriate sign ) is the entire ball , plus the area @xmath20 covers with the two discs ( and here ` minimal ' means simply the minimal such positive area ) . in any event , modulo @xmath100 the correction terms are equal .",
    "the isomorphism between the two correction terms means that in a very real sense choosing a swaddling map @xmath20 along with the homotopy class in which it sits is exactly the same thing as choosing a framing that is null - homotopic as an element of @xmath130 .",
    "we have shown then that @xmath20 can be lifted to @xmath179 , but only for ` half ' our possible choices of @xmath98 .",
    "we have shown then that for framings which give us an element of the trivial homotopy class of @xmath130 , @xmath187 .",
    "we have yet to show what framings those are .",
    "let us recall the mappings defined in section 2.3 .",
    "@xmath53 mapped @xmath48 to @xmath9 , sending the two components of the boundary to the tangent bundle of the knot @xmath40 in antipodal ways , while @xmath51 and @xmath52 took the boundary of a disc , and mapped it to @xmath74 and to @xmath108 correspondingly .",
    "thus , we have a @xmath188 action on @xmath25 , whose action is to flip : @xmath189 .",
    "@xmath53 then descends to the quotient @xmath190 but @xmath191 is also just @xmath192 , so @xmath193 is in fact a map from @xmath192 to itself .",
    "@xmath192 is a non - orientable space , therefore only the degree of @xmath165 is only defined mod 2 . but",
    "the flipping action @xmath189 is precisely the non - trivial path in @xmath192 , hence the degree of @xmath165 must be 1 ( this follows from the topological assertion that the degree of a map is @xmath194 of that map ) .",
    "this gives us a complete characterization of the framings for which @xmath98 lifts to @xmath179- they are exactly those framings for which the mod 2 degree of the ` extended gauss mapping ' @xmath165 is 1 .",
    "this leads us to the rather startling conclusion that , given the blackboard framing , our ` trivial ' knot turns out not to be the circle at all , but rather the boundary of the moebius band .",
    "by adding a correction term , we have shown that the gauss self - linking integral can be made to be an invariant of framed knots .",
    "it so happens @xcite that this invariant coincides with the so - called ` writhing number ' of the curve , obtained by taking the number of positive crossings and subtracting the number of negative crossings .",
