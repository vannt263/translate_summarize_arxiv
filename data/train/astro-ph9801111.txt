    "in the absence of a solar antineutrino flux , the superkamiokande ( sk ) background is expected to be isotropic . in the presence of solar antineutrinos , positrons emitted by i@xmath4d contribute to the background , which , due to the angular dependence of i@xmath4d cross section , should have a non - zero angular slope proportional to the antineutrino flux .",
    "a linear fit to the counting yield , @xmath12 ( in the angular region where events from the @xmath2 interactions can be neglected , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , provides the antineutrino flux @xmath13 through the relation :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the number of free protons , t is the exposure time , @xmath16 is the ( assumed constant ) detection efficiency , @xmath17 the minimal detectable antineutrino energy and @xmath18 is the cross section averaged over the antineutrino spectrum for @xmath19 .    in order to provide a quantitative illustration of the previous points we used data from the first 101.9 operational days of sk , as reported in fig.3 of @xcite , corresponding to @xmath20 .",
    "the reported background does not show an angular dependence . according to equation ( 3 ) , to extract an upper limit on the solar antineutrino flux",
    ", we must know the average cross section @xmath18 , which can be determined within two approches :    @xmath21_assuming _ that the antineutrino spectrum has the same shape as that of @xmath22b solar neutrinos , one has @xmath23 .",
    "this gives , as a final result , @xmath24 , to the 95% c.l .",
    "this bound corresponds to a fraction x=3.5% of the solar neutrino flux ( in the energy range @xmath25 ) predicted by the ssm @xcite .",
    "@xmath26 as @xmath27 is an increasing function of @xmath11 , one has @xmath28 .",
    "this lower limit to @xmath18 gives a _ model independent _ bound @xmath29 to the 95% c.l .",
    "we remark two points of the method just presented :    * the sensitivity to antineutrinos increases as statistics accumulates . within three years of data taking",
    ", the sensitivity to @xmath1 transition probability will reach the 1% level , thus allowing for a definite test of several theoretical models . *",
    "the determination of the angular slope @xmath30 provides a mean for _ detecting _ antineutrinos from the sun ( and not only for deriving upper bounds ) .",
    "a non vanishing slope for sk background would be , in fact , a clear signature of a solar antineutrino flux .    .",
    "if a type  ii supernova explosion occurs near the center of our galaxy about 4000 @xmath0 events and 300 @xmath31 events will be produced in the superkamiokande detector @xcite .",
    "the detection of supernova neutrinos and antineutrinos will provide important information on the supernova mechanism .",
    "in particular we remark that :    * from the strong correlation of the elastic scattering events one can reconstruct the supernova direction with an accuracy of about four degrees @xcite ; * from a fit to experimental data one can determine the number of neutrinos and antineutrinos events , thus providing important inputs to check supernova modelling .",
    "the anisotropy of i@xmath4d is so small that it looks reasonable to neglect it when discussing the detector sensitivity @xcite . however , let us investigate how it can affect the data analysis . with this aim",
    "we have simulated a supernova explosion in the galactic plane , assuming that it produces @xmath32 and @xmath33 events in the detector .",
    "we took into account a @xmath34 angular resolution @xcite and repeated the simulation two - hundred times .",
    "we analysed the data looking for the galactic longitude @xmath35 of the supernova and the ratio @xmath36 of reconstructed events , see fig.2 .",
    "if the analysis is performed neglecting the anisotropy ( i.e. @xmath37 ) the supernova direction is correctly determined within the predicted accuracy , however the reconstructed @xmath38 is badly underestimated ( @xmath39 , the correct value being @xmath40 ) and the fit is poor ( @xmath41 on the average of the 200 simulations , using 20 angular bin ) .",
    "we checked that when the anisotropy is included , both the supernova direction and the ratio @xmath38 are correctly reconstructed , and the quality of the fit improves significantly .",
    "these features are clearly understood :    * as the positron angular distribution is symmetrical around the supernova direction , it does not alter its reconstruction . *",
    "the depleted forward positron production mimics a reduced number of @xmath2 events .",
