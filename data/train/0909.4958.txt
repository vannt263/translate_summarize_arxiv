    "dedicated to leopoldo garca coln on the occasion of his eightieth birthday .",
    "nonequilibrium stationary states ( ness ) in real systems must be maintained by interaction with ( effectively infinite ) external reservoirs . since a complete microscopic description of such reservoirs is generally not feasible it is necessary to represent them by some type of modeling@xcite .",
    "however , unlike systems in equilibrium , which maintain themselves without external inputs and for which one can prove ( when not inside a coexistence region of the phase diagram ) that bulk behavior is independent of the nature of the boundary interactions , we do not know how different microscopic modeling of external inputs , affects the resulting ness .",
    "one particular type of modeling dynamics leading to ness is via gaussian thermostats , see @xcite .",
    "analytical results as well as computer simulations have shown that the stationary states produced by these dynamics behave in many cases in accord with those obtained from more realistic models@xcite .",
    "this has led us to continue our study of the ness in current carrying thermostated systems . in our previous work ,",
    "see @xcite we carried out extensive numerical and analytical investigations of the dependence of the current on the electric field for a model system consisting of @xmath11 particles with unit mass , moving among a fixed periodic array of discs in a two dimensional square @xmath12 with periodic boundary conditions , see fig .",
    "they are acted on by an external ( electric ) field @xmath0 parallel to the @xmath13-axis and by a `` gaussian thermostat '' .",
    "( the discs are located so that there is a finite horizon , _",
    "i.e. _ there is a maximum distance a particle can move before hitting a disc or obstacle ) .",
    "here @xmath19 , with @xmath20 the region occupied by the discs ( obstacles ) and @xmath21 represents the elastic scattering which takes place at the surface of the obstacles .",
    "the purpose of the gaussian thermostat , represented by the term @xmath22 in , is to maintain the total kinetic energy @xmath23 constant , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath24 .",
    "it also has the effect of making the flow @xmath25 generated by on the @xmath26 dimensional energy surface non hamiltonian when @xmath27 .",
    "another effect of the thermostat is to effectively couple all the particles in a mean field way , @xmath28 , depending only on the total momentum of the particles .",
    "note that this is the only coupling between the particles in this system .",
    "our main interest is in the ness of this model system .",
    "to get some analytical handle on the form of the ness we also investigated numerically a model system in which the deterministic collisions with the obstacles are replaced by a stochastic process in which particle velocities get their orientations changed at random times , independently for each particle @xcite .",
    "this yields , in the limit @xmath29 , a self consistent boltzmann equation .",
    "in the spatially uniform case , the only one we shall consider here , the equation takes the form          or @xmath35 this ensures that @xmath36 is independent of time , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath37 . when @xmath38 also @xmath39 and @xmath2 will approach , as @xmath40 , the function @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the area of the unit sphere in @xmath43 dimensions .",
    "there will thus not be a unique stationary solution of .",
    "the situation is different when @xmath44 . in that case @xmath45",
    "independent of @xmath46 .",
    "it is this ness of which we shall study here .",
    "the outline of the rest of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we show that the stationary solution vanishes for @xmath47 . in section 3",
    "we obtain an exact expression for the steady state solution of this equation in one dimension . in section 4",
    "we investigate the small field limit of this stationary distribution . finally in section 5",
    "we find the small field limit of the distribution in two dimensions .                  where @xmath52 is the surface of the sphere of radius @xmath53 .",
    "since in the steady state we must have @xmath54 it follows that @xmath4 if @xmath55 , where @xmath33 is now the stationary self consistent value .",
    "when @xmath56 , @xmath33 will decrease as @xmath57 , as long as @xmath58 , and so the maximum speed will grow as @xmath59 .    observe that , as noted before , the limit for @xmath60 is very different from that obtained when @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "this behavior is due to the fact that the collision term preserves @xmath61 .",
    "in particular it would fail if one also adds a non linear boltzmann particle - particle collisions term to the right hand side of .",
    "in that case the stationary distribution would be positive for all @xmath9 .",
    "we expect however that would describe the behavior of the system for a long time when the effective rate of inter - particle collisions is small compared to the rate of collisions with the obstacles .",
    "observe that at @xmath88 the solution is singular if @xmath89 .",
    "this means that the field is strong enough to push the velocity of the particle close to its limiting value before a collision happen .",
    "furthermore , when the field goes to 0 we do not obtain a maxwellian distribution . to be sure",
    ", there is no reason why this should happen since we do not have any mechanism ( such as inter - particle collisions ) which would tend to bring the system to equilibrium , as one would expect to be the case in a realistic physical model .",
    "this expression is clearly analytic in @xmath94 for @xmath95 . in particular we can compute the zero order term by expanding @xmath96 in term of @xmath97 .",
    "clearly only terms odd in @xmath94 will appear .",
    "the term linear in @xmath94 cancel out the exponent @xmath98 .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath99 gives , once multiplied by @xmath100 , a term @xmath101 .",
    "this gives us :                          we do not have an exact solution of this equation for arbitrary field strength .",
    "we can however still find the small @xmath115 behavior of @xmath3 as we did before for the one dimensional case . to do this",
    "we first expand @xmath3 in harmonics of the angular part of @xmath9 .",
    "this means that that we write :      where @xmath117 . we have taken the field to be in the @xmath13-direction , @xmath118 , so that no term in @xmath119 appears due to the symmetry of the system with respect to the @xmath13 axis . substituting in we obtain :",
    "@xmath120 where we have set @xmath121 . since we expect that the distribution @xmath3 will depend only on @xmath122 when @xmath112 we can assume that @xmath123 for @xmath124 . when @xmath125 , the right hand side of vanishes .",
    "the equation thus becomes , after symplifying a common @xmath126 factor , @xmath127 while the leading term in @xmath94 of the equation for @xmath128 is            a similar analysis shows that the small @xmath115 behavior of the ness described by will be of the same form as that given by in all dimension @xmath132 , in particular the zero order term will be an exponential in @xmath133 .",
    "we do not however have any intuitive heuristic explanation for this behavior on the more microscopic many particles level .",
    "let us go back now to our original problem , the ness for the @xmath11 particles system in an electric field and gaussian thermostat , described by eqs .",
    "( [ dyn1])-([dyn3 ] ) .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we expect that in the limit @xmath29 this ness will agree with our results for the stationary distribution of the boltzmann equation ( [ be ] ) _ i.e. _ there will be a cut - off in the particle speed independent of @xmath11 when @xmath11 becomes very large .",
    "this indicates that the ness for the original model will be , for large @xmath11 , concentrated on those parts of the @xmath134 dimensional sphere in which the particle speeds are closer to each other than they would for a uniform distribution on the sphere .",
    "the latter is of course what gives rise to a maxwellian distribution with the same mean energy .",
    "this is consistent with what we found in @xcite , see in particular section iii there .",
