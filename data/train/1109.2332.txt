    "a lot of attention has been paid to explain the current accelerated expansion of the universe . as is well known ,",
    "general relativity ( gr ) can not explain this fact unless a type of dark energy or another sort of exotic configuration is included .",
    "many scientists hitherto have been captivated by this idea while others prefer to keep a skeptical position and opt for review part of the standard lore of cosmology , wondering if there might be viable alternative theories of gravity which avoid unusual constituents .",
    "an active line of research towards this goal resides in braneworld cosmology where any proposed geometrical model should be self - consistent and able to reproduce an accurate cosmological evolution  @xcite .    in the brane scenario ,",
    "the earlier model proposed by regge and teitelboim is an attempt to generalize gr  @xcite , consisting of a brane ricci scalar in addition to a brane cosmological constant @xmath1 .",
    "this type of gravity is often referred to as _ geodetic brane gravity _  ( gbg )  @xcite when no gravitational effect from the brane into the bulk is considered . in this stringy approach to classical gravitation ,",
    "the embedding functions are alternative field variables instead of the four - dimensional metric components .",
    "gbg is parametrized by a conserved bulk energy , which renders a very interesting deviation from gr .",
    "such energy is the source of a radiation - like energy characterizing higher dimensional cosmological models .",
    "similarly , the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) braneworld model has been considered as one of the most promising scenarios to study viable modifications of gr since , at low energies , it explains acceptably the late - time acceleration of our universe  @xcite .",
    "both brane models are conjectured to belong to an unified brane theory proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the main idea underlying this work is that these brane models may be closely connected by means of a geometric aggregate : a linearly extrinsic curvature term arising from the trajectory swept out by the brane .",
    "indeed , this term introduces second - order derivative correction terms into the original gbg theory leading in turn to a robust geometrical effective model able to provide an accelerated branelike gravity resembling in certain limit that of the dgp approach .",
    "if we are interested in maintaining the second order nature of the equations of motion to guarantee that no extra degrees of freedom propagate around the bulk , from a geometrical perspective , we have restrictions on the terms that we may include in any physically viable modification for gbg . indeed ,",
    "in addition to the first two lovelock terms on the @xmath2-dimensional worldvolume , namely the @xmath1 and the @xmath3 scalars  @xcite , we may only incorporate two possible boundary terms related to either a bulk einstein - hilbert term or a bulk gauss - bonnet term - dimensional case , the higher lovelock terms are total derivatives and do not contribute to the equations of motion . ] .",
    "these terms will necessarily introduce brane lagrangians either proportional to @xmath4 or to @xmath5 as discussed in  @xcite ( see also below for notation ) .",
    "now , as the original prescription for gbg does not consider the bulk gravity to be dynamical , we will focus on another @xmath2-dimensional worldvolume geometrical term leading to second - order equations of motion .",
    "more specifically , in this work we consider only the linear term in the mean extrinsic curvature swept out by the brane as a small modification to the gbg .",
    "this fact provides an alternative mechanism to contrast the cosmological constant effects by introducing this peculiar kind of correction into the geodetic brane dynamics .",
    "hence , in a frw framework , we realize that the @xmath0 parameter enforcing this brane correction contributes as either a catalyst or a preventer of the acceleration of this branelike universe in direct dependence of the sign of the mentioned parameter .    as a consequence of the invariance under reparametrizations of this model ,",
    "the brane energy is conserved .",
    "this fact is important because it parametrizes the deviation of the einstein limit as in gbg .",
    "we thereby obtain a useful expression to get a friedmann - type equation , providing fingerprints of the cosmological evolution of this sort of universes . as a byproduct ,",
    "when we consider no gravitational effects on the bulk from the brane , we reproduce the dgp cosmology accordingly where the role of the inverse crossover scale is played now by the @xmath0 parameter .",
    "this would then suggest that in our approach , the regarded second order - correction term acts like the dgp bulk curvature effect thus modifying the acceleration behaviour of this branelike universe , and in addition , when we switch off the cosmological constant content , we are able to obtain an accelerated universe behaviour similar to the one developed in  @xcite .    this extrinsic curvature correction term has drawn attention for a long time in several contexts .",
    "it was regarded in the study of hypersurfaces in differential geometry  @xcite .",
    "this correction term was also considered in the bending and shape determination of phospholipid membranes  @xcite . in the relativistic context",
    ", it appears in the improvement for the earlier attempt by dirac to picture the electron as a bubble  @xcite , and more recently , it has been considered as an effective @xmath6 field theory yielding one of the galileon actions pursuing applications in particle physics and cosmology  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we deal with the geometrical aspects of the modified gbg .",
    "the variation casts out crucial results for the entire discussion of our approach . in section 3 ,",
    "we specialize our model to a frw geometry for the branelike universe . in section 4 ,",
    "we provide a friedman type equation , and also we analyse the effects that the @xmath4-term implements when the radiation - like energy is vanishing or is very small .",
    "section 5 is dedicated to show how this model reproduces the dgp cosmology accordingly . in section 6 ,",
    "we conclude and discuss our results .",
    "we consider a spacelike @xmath7-brane @xmath8 , propagating in a flat five - dimensional nondynamical minkowski background spacetime with metric @xmath9 , @xmath10 . to specify the brane trajectory , or worldvolume @xmath11 , in the bulk , we set @xmath12 to being the parametrization of the four - dimensional trajectory of @xmath8 where @xmath13 are the local coordinates for the background spacetime , @xmath14 are local coordinates for @xmath11 , and @xmath15 the embedding functions @xmath16 . in general ,",

    "we have also included a cosmological constant term , @xmath1 .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 corresponds to a constant enforcing corrections to the gbg described by the original regge - teitelboim proposal which includes only a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional worldvolume ricci scalar  @xcite .",

    "a key observation is that action  ( [ eq : model ] ) , despite its dependence on second - order geometrical terms , leads to a second - order equation of motion ( see below ) .",

    "in fact , this tensor captures relevant physical and geometrical information that is mediated by the worldvolume geometry .",

    "the classical brane trajectories can be obtained from the normal component of the covariant conservation law for ( [ eq : stress ] ) , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the worldvolume covariant derivative  @xcite .",
    "it is then straightforward to obtain a generalized geodetic - type equation governing the brane evolution @xmath45 where @xmath46 this tensor is conserved and its conservation is supported by the bianchi identity , @xmath47 , and the codazzi - mainardi condition for embedded surfaces , @xmath48 .",
    "the equation of motion ( [ eq : eom ] ) is of second order in derivatives of the embedding functions because of the presence of the extrinsic curvature tensor .",
    "this is so even though we have the presence of second - order derivative terms in our model through the scalars @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",

    "the case @xmath153 corresponds to the self - accelerating branch in the dgp approach which in general is ruled out of the brane world scenario due to the appearance of a number of pathologies @xcite .",

    "therefore , we find that when @xmath166 fades away then modified gbg leads to a late - time self - acceleration and in consequence we have an interesting alternative effective model supporting this degravitation characteristic .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that gbg modified by a curvature brane scalar defined by a linear extrinsic curvature term leads us to reproduce under certain conditions a similar brane cosmological behaviour as in the dgp setup .",
    "contrarily to the dgp approach , we considered an empty fixed bulk which , however , leads us to reproduce similar dynamical equations .",
    "in addition , we showed that the effective potential emerging in our model exhibits an accelerated behaviour for this universe as dgp theory does . in this modified gbg",
    ", the inverse dgp crossover scale @xmath155 is played by the parameter related to the @xmath4-term .",
    "we thus observe that this model mimics the dynamics of dgp approach with the important exception that in our case such effects directly result from the geometrical characteristics of the brane through the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "even though gravity was switched off from the beggining in our setup all this happens so because modified gbg is enclosed in the set of purely gravitational @xmath6 brane theories that gives rise to the galileon field theory where that peculiar type of scalar fields is able to create accelerating spacetimes similar to those of the dgp setup  @xcite , which are argued to explain also dark energy .",
    "from another point of view , we study part of the galileon field theory , restricted to the first three lovelock brane lagrangians directly .",
    "this prescription surely constitutes an interesting theoretical alternative to analyse certain subjects in braneworld cosmology .",
    "in particular , we confirm that the acceleration description of brane universes can be formulated differently from what we have been accustomed to so far . then , motivated by the equivalence at the effective level , with dgp gravity , we believe that this modified gbg deserves a deep exploration at the classical canonical level , followed by an extensive study of its quantum mechanical aspects in order to discern on the physical viability of the brane model",

    "we are interested in understanding how much an ostrogradski - hamiltonian development of model  ( [ eq : model ] ) is sensitive to the fact that the ghost and tachyon states appear in this scenario  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , we believe that our approach opens the scope of brane theories to be included as a correction terms , like the gauss - bonnet counter - term , yielding also second order equations of motion  @xcite improving thus the gbg framework . it is worth saying that the terms appearing in the present model belong to a wide range of effective field brane models related to the so - called galileons which possess interesting symmetry properties that also deserve an exhaustive investigation in view of their potential applications to particle physics and cosmology  @xcite .",

    "<S> we explore the cosmological implications provided by the geodetic brane gravity action corrected by an extrinsic curvature brane term , describing a codimension-1 brane embedded in a 5d fixed minkowski spacetime . in the geodetic brane gravity action we accommodate the correction term through a linear term in the extrinsic curvature swept out by the brane . </S>",
    "<S> we study the resulting geodetic - type equation of motion . within a friedmann - robertson - walker metric </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a generalized friedmann equation describing the associated cosmological evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that , when the radiation - like energy contribution from the extra dimension is vanishing , this effective model leads to a self-(non - self)-accelerated expansion of the brane - like universe in dependence on the nature of the concomitant parameter @xmath0 associated with the correction , which resembles an analogous behaviour in the dgp brane cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> several possibilities in the description for the cosmic evolution of this model are embodied and characterized by the involved density parameters related in turn to the cosmological constant , the geometry characterizing the model , the introduced @xmath0 parameter as well as the dark like - energy and the matter content on the brane . </S>"
