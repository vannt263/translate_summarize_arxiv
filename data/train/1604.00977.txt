    "fourier - transform infrared ( ftir ) spectroscopy is a widely utilized method to investigate the optical response of gasses , liquids and solids @xcite . in general ,",
    "steady - state properties are measured , however , numerous approaches have been developed over the years to explore time - dependent phenomena by fourier - transform interferometry @xcite , many of them optimized for a certain time regime .",
    "standard rapid - scan techniques are limited by the mirror velocity to a fraction of a second ( typically 10  ms ) , depending on the spectral resolution @xmath0 required : @xmath1 . since this is often not sufficient , step - scanning",
    "is nowadays implemented in several high - end commercial fourier - transform instruments because there is no inherent time limit .",
    "it covers the largest dynamical range with a time resolution of the order of nanoseconds determined by the current detector and electronics technology @xcite and still achieving a high spectral resolution @xmath2  .",
    "the only restriction is the repeatability of the process : depending on the resolution , spectral range and desired signal - to - noise ratio , it has to be executed hundreds of times .",
    "in contrast to the continuously moving interferometer mirror in the rapid - scan configuration , the advantage of the step - scan method is the continuous recording of the signal at a fixed mirror position .",
    "this is repeated after the mirror has moved to the next position , eventually composing the complete interferogram .",
    "the step - scan technique is mainly applied in biophysics and polymer chemistry where , for instance , the photolysis processes of chemical reactions @xcite , bacteria systems @xcite and the time - dependent reorientation of liquid crystals under the influence of a short electric field @xcite are studied . but",
    "also temperature- and light - induced phase transitions can be investigated @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is used to examine the characteristics of lasers and their mode spectra @xcite and for photo - reflection measurements of semiconducting materials as well as quantum wells @xcite .    here",
    "we want to present and discuss our experimental setups employed to investigate the dynamics of phase transitions . tracing the vibrational spectra of molecules",

    "in the left panel of fig .  [ fig:1-stepscan ] the data acquisition of a step - scan measurement is schematically depicted . at each mirror position @xmath3 along the traveling distance of the mirror",
    "the temporal varying reflection signal @xmath4 is recorded .",
    "the complete interferogram is sampled for various times and retardations by successive stepwise moving of the mirror . a subsequent fourier transformation for each measured time point @xmath5 in the intensity `` matrix '' @xmath6",
    "derives the time - resolved spectrum @xmath7 .",
    "the process can be repeated several times to improve the signal - to - noise ratio whereas at each @xmath8 position the time - dependent signal is averaged ( typically 10 to 50 times ) .",
    "additionally , the stability of the mirror influences the signal - to - noise ratio significantly @xcite , therefore , one must take care that the spectrometer is located in a vibration - free and silent environment .",
    "for this reason we place our ftir - spectrometer on a heavy optical bench mounted on air attenuators to decouple the system from the environment .",
    "furthermore , the vacuum pumps were placed in a separated room to reduce vibrations and acoustic noise . this way we reached a mirror stability better than 3  nm .",

    "thus , the trigger signal sequence is very important and crucial in a step - scan measurement .",

    "the time resolution @xmath13 depends mainly on the response time of the detector .",
    "standard pc - mct - detectors , operating in the photo - current mode , have a minimum response time of @xmath14s .",
    "their disadvantage is that the measured current becomes nonlinear above a certain incident threshold intensity .",
    "a photovoltaic ( pv ) detector has a two order of magnitudes shorter response time due to the small detector area .",

    "are utilized .",
    "the time resolution also depends on the amplifier and the a / d - converter .",
    "there are two amplifiers , the build - in amplifier of the spectrometer and the ka100-a1 from kolmar technologies with a bandwidth of 250  mhz . as an a / d - converter the internal converter of the spectrometer with its time resolution of 6  @xmath15s , with a dynamical range of 24  bit and a maximal input voltage of @xmath16  v , can be used , or a transient recorder m3i.4142 from spectrum systementwicklung microelectronic gmbh , grosshansdorf with a bandwidth of 400  mhz at 16  bit and @xmath17  v.    the standard interferogram of a fourier - transform spectrometer consists of an ac- and dc - component : while only the ac - signal contains the important spectral information the dc - signal is usually removed by an electronic high - pass filter .",
    "the phase correction can only be performed directly for a rapid - scan measurement . in a step - scan experiment",
    "the spectrum can include positive as well as negative features .",
    "thus , a phase correction with the raw time - resolved ac - signal does not work .",
    "two options exist to resolve this complication : first , the simultaneously recording of the dc - signal and the ac - signal ; the dc - component provides the right phase correction for the ac - component .",
    "the second possibility is to use the phase of a previous rapid - scan measurement @xcite .",
    "electrically induced phenomena occur mainly in semiconductor leading to non - linear conductivity or negative differential resistance @xcite .",
    "high electric fields can also trigger phase transitions , for instance in charge - density wave systems @xcite or correlated insulators @xcite . in organic conductors",
