    "associated spatiotemporal clustering of departure times can lead to traffic congestion and delays @xcite @xcite @xcite . quantifying synergies between broadcast information involving the objective status of a threat and concurrent social factors that may inhibit or accelerate action is critical to devising effective strategies for ensuring the safety of populations in crisis situations .",
    "challenges to coordinating collective action when a population is at risk may be exacerbated by a variety of influences , including the desire to locate a missing family member or panic of an individual group member , each of which may derail action for the entire group @xcite @xcite .",
    "alternatively , desirable outcomes occur when group action exceeds the sum of its parts . identifying and promoting",
    "effective teams has been investigated in the context of emergent leadership , wisdom of crowds , performance stability , and division of labor @xcite @xcite @xcite .",

    "what extent can individual performance differences within a group be deduced from other ( social network ) measurable behaviors @xcite @xcite ?    this paper isolates and quantifies tensions in decision making that arise when individuals act cohesively , as in families , teams , or squads .",
    "we compare the behavior of individuals acting alone with their behavior in groups , whose actions are linked through a network of influence or communication in a crisis situation . in this paper , we employ a combination of experiments in behavioral network science , analysis of social network usage , and artificial neural network models to quantify the consequences of different protocols for decision making among groups that are part of a larger population subject to an impinging crisis .",
    "our results link features of individual human behavior with observable behaviors of groups and thereby address critical issues that arise in identifying individual differences that constrain or promote achievement of group objectives @xcite @xcite .",
    "the insights gained from investigating collective behavior in evacuation scenarios through behavioral experiments and data - driven modeling can inform the design of public policies for collective action in stressful and uncertain situations .    * our work in context . * our experimental approach of quantifying specific behavioral drivers in a controlled setting constitutes an intermediate between surveys conducted in the aftermath of disasters , which can be difficult to execute on a large scale and often qualitative , and controlled human - subject experiments of isolated cognitive tasks . in this controlled setting , all information observed by participants prior to their decisions is recorded , facilitating data - driven modeling of decision making .",
    "our approach capitalizes on prior work developing mathematical models of information flow on social networks to isolate drivers of collective dynamics @xcite and performing behavioral experiments to quantify individual decision making in crisis situations @xcite .",
    "the focus of these previous studies has been on evacuate - or - not responses to simulated natural disasters studied through a model - experiment - model paradigm , where initial theoretical studies predict effects of decision making under various social and economic pressures , followed by experimental tests of such predictions to quantify those effects .",
    "the analysis of such experiments enables data - driven models which in turn inform the design of subsequent experiments .    a theoretical component of this previous work @xcite identified a decision model for evacuation behavior that described the heterogeneous and non - optimal behavior of human subjects observed empirically in behavioral experiments which formed the basis for the experiment described in this paper .",
    "the model was used to quantify individual differences in decision dynamics and relate those differences to psychometric measurements of personality and risk attitudes .",
    "this model was derived from detailed empirical observations , and as such stands in sharp contrast to a set of models typically used in numerical simulations or large - scale , data - driven studies that treat decisions as random , optimal , or based on a threshold applied to a state variable representing opinion , which is updated by an assumed interaction rule ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite ) .    in our current study , we probe mesoscale decision and behavior dynamics by dividing members of a community into cohesive groups .",
    "each group must act as a unit and make a forced evacuate - or - not decision in the face of a disaster , which will either hit or miss the community according to a time - evolving likelihood .",
    "building on the earlier work involving tradeoffs between broadcast and social information on individual decision making @xcite , this project focuses specifically on isolating novel features that arise when decisions impact a group .",
    "our experimental platform adapts the framework of kearns et al .",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite , who have conducted a series of `` behavioral network science '' ( bns ) experiments that have focused on collective problem solving tasks , such as abstract graph coloring problems or economic investment games . in both competitive and cooperative tasks and scenarios , human subjects in these previous bns studies",
    "have been shown to `` perform remarkably well at the collective level '' @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the work of kearns et al . , our investigations involve decision making in a threat scenario where we expect both heterogeneous behaviors across individual subjects and non - optimality of behavior at both the individual and collective levels .    * experimental overview . *",
    "the experiment described in this paper places participants in a sequence of simulated disaster scenarios , each of which involves an approaching threat ( e.g. , wildfire or hurricane ) that may impact their community within an uncertain window of time .",
    "the status of the threat is described by a time - dependent likelihood based on an underlying stochastic process .",
    "resource limitations are represented by a finite number of available spaces in an evacuation shelter .",
    "participants are at risk of losing a portion of their initial wealth based on their action and the disaster outcome . in each scenario",
    ", individuals make a binding evacuate - or - not decision based on the information available .",
    "in some scenarios , participants act as individuals , in which case , once the decision to evacuate is made , the individual action ( evacuation to the shelter ) follows immediately , providing sufficient shelter space is available . in other scenarios ,",
    "the same individuals are grouped into teams . in these cases ,",
    "group action is determined by the collective decisions of the team subject to availability of shelter space and a forced action protocol .",
    "the action protocols used in this study include majority - vote ( the group evacuates when the majority has decided ) , first - to - go ( the group evacuates when the first member decides ) , and last - to - go ( the group evacuates when the entire group achieves consensus ) .",
    "this experimental design enables us to quantitatively compare and contrast individual and group decision making , as well as the effectiveness of different protocols for combining individual decisions into collective group action .",
    "for example , under the first - to - go protocol , in which a `` go '' decision made by one individual within a group forces the entire group to evacuate , behaviors observed in individual humans without a group influence ( such as tending to evacuate earlier than is optimal @xcite ) would result in poor population - level performance : a single individual s early evacuation commits the entire group to action , resulting in collective loss of temporal and financial resources . for optimal group performance in a first - to - go scenario",
    ", individuals must instead modify their behavior , either by reducing evacuation rates , increasing disaster likelihood thresholds for evacuating , or by deferring to other members of the group to make the decisions .",
    "finally , based on the results of the behavioral experiment , we develop individual data - driven artificial neural network models for decision making which incorporate individual and group disaster scenarios .",
    "heterogeneity in the decision models is linked to individual differences , identified using two alternate means . the first is based directly on the experimental data .",
    "the second is determined by social network ( specifically facebook ) use .",
    "the two methods produce quantitatively similar decision models and overall accuracy , suggesting that social network use may be predictive of individual behavior in a group setting .",
    "differences in personality traits and risk perception can influence decision making , specifically in scenarios involving evacuation from natural disasters @xcite .",
    "common assessments of personality include the big five inventory questionnaire , a questionnaire based on five characteristics ( extraversion , agreeableness , conscientiousness , neuroticism , and openness ) often used in psychological research @xcite@xcite , and common assessments of risk perception include the domain - specific risk - attitude scale @xcite@xcite . furthermore , the rapid development and widespread adoption of social networks such as facebook and twitter has lead to increasing interest in identifying personality - related factors from online profiles and social media activity @xcite .",
    "previous studies have commonly focused on developing predictive personality profiles from individual behavior on social media platforms , and it has been shown that computer models can outperform humans in assessing personality @xcite @xcite .",
    "the experiment detailed in this paper facilitates a rich investigation of the differences between group and individual behaviors and the sub - optimality of human behavior .",
    "a further exploration of collective decision dynamics is described in @xcite , which expands the analysis of the empirical data presented here and uses a complementary but methodologically different approach to modeling decision making . in @xcite , a few - parameter decision model with an explicit functional form motivated by empirical data",
    "is used to model individual decisions , simulate group behavior , and determine optimal decision strategies with bayesian inference .    in this paper , our inherently multiscale results link characteristics of individual humans , observed behaviors of groups , and outcomes for the population as a whole , thereby addressing issues that arise in identifying individual differences that constrain or promote group objectives .",
    "we obtain information about the role of cohesive units in decision making , which is correlated with individual differences in the population , and which identifies emergent leaders as individuals willing to make decisions for the group , as well as followers who avoid initiating group action .",
    "the results have direct relevance to complex , real - world threat scenarios as well as coordination and control of civilian populations at risk .",
    "on march 13 , 2015 , we conducted a controlled behavioral experiment at the university of california , santa barbara ( ucsb ) in order to quantitatively characterize the decision - making behavior of both individuals and groups in stressful situations . in our experiment , 50 participants each decided if and when to evacuate from an impending virtual natural disaster ( fig [ fig : overview]a ) .",
    "all participants provided written informed consent , and the experimental protocol was approved by the institutional review board of ucsb .",
    "our experimental design is based on that of carlson et al .",
    "@xcite but differs primarily with the addition of groups . in both experiments , 50 individuals participated in several scenarios ( trials ) where the strike likelihood of an impending virtual disaster was broadcast at regular intervals , along with the availability of beds in an evacuation shelter .",
    "participants used this information to decide if and when to evacuate .",
    "they were staked a number of points before each trial , and points were deducted from the initial stake based on the success of their actions . while participants in the previous study made decisions as individuals , our experiment also includes scenarios where participants were randomly assigned to groups which act according to a specified protocol .",
    "this experiment involved 144 trials , each lasting 20 to 60 half - second time steps . during each trial , participants were provided with _ disaster _",

    "participants could view the decisions and rankings of their group members , referred to as _ social _ information , to formulate their strategy based on their group - mates behavior .",
    "prior to the behavioral experiment , we collected each participant s facebook archive , which contains their profile , liked pages , and site activity .",

    "this delay may be the result of a reaction time delay associated with elapsed time between the participant s initial observation of @xmath0 and other state variables and their click of the evacuate button , or by a slight system delay in server - client communication .",
    "since the state variables update on half - second time increments , the @xmath0 value may increase or decrease during this period , leading to a positive data point ( i.e. , evacuation decision ) for values of @xmath0 that did not trigger the decision .    to account for this ,",
    "we apply a time delay correction ( fig [ fig : nnflow]a ) to identify the most probable decision time step .",
    "a backwards shift by one time increment is applied to the data when a decision is recorded on a time step in which @xmath0 has dropped by at least 0.2 compared to the preceding time step . adding the time delay correction to the baseline model improves its accuracy to 78.0% ;",

    "ultimately , with each incremental addition of features , the accuracy of the enhanced model increases relative to the baseline model , indicating that the additional features result in better prediction of the test set .",
    "decisions to evacuate are dependent on current - time parameters as well as their immediate history and those that govern the situation on a more general level ( total shelter capacity , group constraints ) .",
    "since the test trials are withheld from the training data , and the test accuracy increases , the addition of features does not lead to overfitting of the training data .    * comparing the model and experiment . *",
    "the final results of the artificial neural network model are illustrated in fig [ fig : compare ] , which compares the 17 test trials with results of the most accurate model ( + p ) .",
    "the + p model combines the baseline model with the time delay correction , nodes accounting for gradients in likelihood and shelter space , and the individual personality node based on experimental data .",
    "similar results are obtained for the + fb model , which replaces the experimentally determined personality node with information extracted from the participants facebook archives .",
    "the 17 test trials were selected from the middle portion of the experiment , and lie consecutively between trials 81 and 100 , with three trials ( 88 , 89 , 97 ) omitted due to technical difficulties in recording data .",
    "we chose to use test trials near the middle of the experiment to minimize possible bias associated with early or late stages of the experiment .",
    "no particular attention was given to the type of trial ; the sample includes at least one of every trial type except for ftg group-25 and ltg group-25 .",
    "model parameters were determined from the remaining 111 trials , with 80% of the data ( chosen randomly ) used to fit parameters @xmath37 and @xmath10 , and the remaining 20% to optimize the threshold used to convert the continuous decision probability function @xmath38 in eq to a binary evacuate - or - not decision for each individual at each time step .",
    "individual decision probabilities , as described in eq , are computed at each time step for the test data and converted to binary decisions for each participant .",
    "the decisions are then combined according to the assigned groups and protocols of the participants from the experiment to produce results for the model - predicted evacuations that are illustrated as blue curves in fig [ fig : compare ] .",
    "these predictions are made sequentially at each time step of the full data set containing 17 test trials , i.e. , with no up- or down - sampling ; the blue curves here depict only predicted group or individual evacuations , without showing the predicted decisions made by each group member .",
    "we observe striking agreement between the model predictions and the experimental data , represented as gray shaded regions . in most cases ,",
    "the model accurately predicts not only the total number of evacuations , but also the approximate timing of the evacuations .",
    "the root - mean - squared error ( rmse ) between observed and predicted evacuations is reported for each trial ; the error is calculated at each time step and averaged over all time steps in a trial .",
    "the trials exhibiting the greatest discrepancy between the model and observations are trials 81 and 93 , both of which are mv group-25 trials . in both cases ,",
    "the final total number of evacuations is correctly predicted ; however , the model predicts that the evacuations will occur somewhat earlier than is observed ( 9 time steps earlier and 6 time steps earlier , respectively ) .",
    "additional discrepancies are observed at early stages in some individual trials , such as trial 82 and trial 95 , where a small number of participants evacuate in the first few time steps of the trial , even though @xmath0 remains stationary and there are 25 shelter spaces .",
    "this early evacuation behavior may reflect the outcome of the previous trial , such as a disaster hit or shelter reaching capacity , which occurs in trials 81 and 94 , respectively .",
    "memory effects extending from one trial to the next are not captured by the model , which is based on single trial parameters .",
    "we report results of a behavioral experiment investigating human decision making in the face of an impending natural disaster .",
    "we characterize individual and group behavior by quantifying several key factors for decision making in a controlled virtual community , including the disaster likelihood , shelter capacity , and decisions of group members , and we formulate a neural network model that predicts decision making of both individuals and groups in different scenarios . including measures of individual personality",
    "significantly increases prediction accuracy compared to a baseline model dependent only on collective experimental variables .",
    "we find that individual behavior does not readily predict group behavior .",
    "we observe a significant difference in decision making between scenarios in which individuals decide solely for themselves and in which individual decisions are combined to determine collective action of a group . on average , participants decide to evacuate at lower values of the disaster likelihood when in groups than when acting as individuals .    in many cases , we find that larger groups are less effective than smaller groups ; the average success rate for individual trials is comparable to the average success rate of group trials , and groups of five perform better than groups of 25 under all protocols except majority - vote .",
    "the notion of the `` wisdom of crowds '' contends that the aggregated consensus decision of a collection of individuals is on average more accurate than an individual s decision @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "condorcet s jury theorem states that , under the assumption that all individuals independently decide with an identical probability of correct decision greater than 0.5 , a collective decision following the majority - vote protocol will have a greater success rate than an individual decision @xcite . in this idealized",
    "setting , the success of the majority - vote increases with group size and converges to 1 in the limit of infinite group size .",
    "an application of condorcet s theorem states that if the individual success rate is less than 0.5 , a pooled majority - vote decision will be less accurate than an individual decision , whereas if individual accuracy is greater than 0.5 , the collective majority - vote accuracy increases as a function of individual accuracy and furthermore increases more sharply for larger group sizes @xcite . while our experiment is significantly more complex than this idealized voting scenario , on average , our observations from majority - vote trials remain consistent with condorcet s theorem ; the individual success rate is 0.604 ( fig [ fig : prinprob ] ) , the group-5 mv success rate is 0.607 , and the group-25 mv success rate is much higher at 0.75 .",
    "including additional social factors such as the rankings of group members can give rise to a wide range of outcomes in group decision making @xcite .",
    "if some individuals have a higher success rate than others , assigning greater weight to the most successful individuals decisions when aggregating opinions into a consensus decision can result in greater collective accuracy @xcite . furthermore , in more complex situations where individuals must decide in response to multiple cues with variable reliability , the wisdom of crowds effect is not necessarily observed ; rather , there can be a finite optimal group size @xcite .",
    "ultimately , we do not find that larger groups necessarily perform better than smaller groups , and in many cases , groups of 25 are on average less successful than individuals .    while there is no significant overall correlation between a participant s rank in individual trials and group trials ,",
    "we observe a significant correlation between individual rank and the time order of decisions in the ltg and mv group-25 trials that differentiates the top - performing group of 25 from the bottom - performing group . in the top - performing group ,",
    "the higher - scoring participants decide earlier on average than the lower - scoring participants within the group , suggesting possible emergent `` leader '' and `` follower '' behavior .",
    "this correlation is not observed in the bottom - performing group .",
    "given knowledge of the current state of the underlying stochastic process driving the disaster likelihood , it is possible to determine the optimal decision strategy @xcite . in many scenarios ,",
    "we observe behavior that is clearly sub - optimal .",
    "for example , when there is sufficient shelter space for all participants and the trial has just begun , some participants nevertheless decide to evacuate in the first few time steps , despite the lack of urgency in space or time .",
    "in those situations , participants would not experience a tradeoff between the information gained with time and the urgency to evacuate due to resource competition . in some cases",
    ", we also observe extreme trial - to - trial variations , such as early evacuations in the absence of time or space constraints , following trials in which the shelter reaches capacity or the disaster hit .",
    "our results emphasize the importance of properly characterizing sub - optimal decisions and non - bayesian adjustments in strategy over time in developing predictive models of human decision - making behavior .",
    "the sub - optimality of real human decision making is explored in @xcite , which compares observed behavior with the optimal strategy as determined under the assumption of a perfect `` bayesian learner '' who aggregates accumulated evidence from previous experience to inform decisions .",
    "the modeling procedure performed in this paper enables the identification and quantification of key factors , using machine learning techniques to identify correlation structure , while also taking into account individual differences in behavior which can be extracted from social network data .",
    "this work also motivates the development of a model for individual decision making in @xcite that is based on a few key parameters and contains an explicit functional form derived from the statistics of experimental data .",
    "that model accurately predicts individual decision making and is used to simulate group behavior , forming a baseline of predictions that are contrasted with observed group behavior to examine the differences between individuals and groups .    *",
    "relationships to past work . *",
    "our work builds on four prior studies of collective behavior in evacuation scenarios .",
    "the first is a spatiotemporal analysis of wildfire progression on a rural landscape and transportation network that determines optimal evacuation routes and clearing times in a realistic setting under the assumption that all individuals act optimally @xcite .",
    "while the decision model is idealized and hence unrealistic , it provides an upper bound on the success of collective behavior .",
    "the second study developed a stochastic model to simulate the progression of a threat by characterizing the evolution of the strike probability as a markov process , and determined optimal decision strategies in the face of stochastically - varying uncertainty @xcite .",
    "we applied this stochastic process to determine the progression of disaster likelihood for each disaster scenario in our experiment .",
    "the third study simulated the decision dynamics of individuals on a social network , where decisions were influenced both by uniform global information broadcast and pairwise neighbor interactions @xcite .",
    "this study found that information transmission on a network could either facilitate or hinder collective action , depending on the influence of social network interactions , and identified the mechanisms leading to cascading behavior and stagnation .    the experimental platform in this paper is largely derived from the fourth study , in which a similar controlled behavioral experiment involving an evacuation scenario was performed , and from which a data - driven model was developed to characterize the influence of disaster likelihood , time pressure , and shelter capacity on decision making @xcite .",
    "compared to the previous study , here we simplify the presentation of broadcast information ( time progression and disaster likelihood ) and social information ( decisions of others and shelter space ) so that it appears on a single screen , rather than being split into separate broadcast and social tabs which participants could switch between during each trial .",
    "the previous study also included the state of being `` in transit '' in addition to home or shelter ; if a participant decided to evacuate when the shelter was full , they would remain in the `` in transit '' state for the remainder of the trial .",
    "the losses incurred from being in the `` in transit '' state were an intermediate value between those of home and shelter . in the previous experiment ,",
    "the loss matrix varied from trial to trial and was displayed on the computer interface .",
    "however , values in the loss matrix were found to have minimal impact on decision making in the earlier study .",
    "therefore , for the current study we chose to fix the loss matrix and only displayed it briefly during the introductory training session .",
    "this allowed us greater flexibility to vary other parameters in the nested experimental design .",
    "our experiment differs most significantly from this previous study with the introduction of forced group trials and protocols for group action .",
    "the previous experiment allowed participants to probe the decisions of their neighbors over a structured social network . in this manner",
    ", individuals could gain information about the decisions of others and the remaining shelter space ; however , each participant acted alone in every trial .",
    "this allowed for the possibility of clustered evacuations , but did not force groups to act together . in the earlier study , participants spent most of their time on the broadcast information tab and relatively little time on the social information tab , aside from the start of the experiment where the available shelter space was displayed .",
    "this motivated our design of a group evacuation experiment to target the role of social information as a driver of decision making .    individual personality , preferences , and risk perception have been shown to influence decision making in evacuation scenarios @xcite . in the current study , we quantified individual personality factors by training an artificial neural network containing a `` personality node '' on the data and correlated our model with personality factors determined from facebook activity .",
    "in contrast , the previous study employed written surveys to determine personality factors , specifically the big five inventory questionnaire , derived from the five - factor ( extraversion , agreeableness , conscientiousness , neuroticism , and openness ) model @xcite @xcite , and the domain - specific risk - attitude scale , a risk perception survey specific to six domains ( social , investment , gambling , health and safety , ethical , and recreational ) @xcite@xcite .",
    "the popularity of online social networks such as facebook and twitter has motivated the investigation of social network data to uncover predictive measures of individual traits @xcite @xcite .",
    "social network data provides a potentially more direct assessment of ongoing activity compared to self - reported preferences .",
    "furthermore , there is significantly more information in social network data ( which is often unavailable due to proprietary or privacy reasons ) which , when properly filtered , may further refine predictions of group relationships and individual personality differences .    * methodological considerations .",
    "* we made multiple intentional choices in the presentation of broadcast information viewed by the participants .",
    "for instance , we displayed @xmath0 as a coarse - grained likelihood rather than a probability , since the presentation of probabilistic information has been shown to affect resultant decisions @xcite .",
    "we also represented risk information as losses rather than incentives to reflect the focus on loss of life or property rather than gains in real disaster situations .",
    "studies have shown that humans react differently to losses than to gains , assigning greater value to differences of equal magnitude in losses compared to gains @xcite @xcite . moreover ,",
    "when performing incentivized tasks , individuals encode the potential loss due to failure rather than the potential gain arising from success , causing some individuals performance levels to decline as incentive levels increase @xcite .    the behavioral distinction in",
    "loss - based versus gain - based experimental settings can be extended to a distinction between risk - based and profit - based scenarios .",
    "risk scenarios such as the natural disaster scenarios considered in this experiment also include other situations that directly endanger personal safety , such as battlefield or military scenarios , firefighting , and search and rescue missions . on the other hand ,",
    "profit scenarios include group decision making in the workplace , community organizations and committees , or foraging ( in animal communities ) .",
    "we have chosen to ignore spatial variation in information arrival times , focusing instead on uniformly distributed information regarding a disaster that impacts or misses the entire community at once .",
    "this isolates key tensions between individual and group decision making in an otherwise homogeneous context . in the case of spatial search or monitoring , which is also observed in collective animal behavior ( e.g. , fish schooling ) , increasing group size",
    "is beneficial as the group can cover more area , unless the area or another resource necessary to perform the action is limited .",
    "for instance , the collective navigation and environmental sensing performance of golden shiners increases monotonically with group size , since individual fish rely more strongly on observations of neighboring fish rather than on the environment itself @xcite .",
    "we also fixed the decision protocols ( ftg , ltg , and mv ) in order to isolate the effect of different protocols on behavior . a popular choice of decision protocol is majority - vote , which has been observed in both hunter - gatherer tribal societies and modern democracies @xcite . in laboratory settings , when groups are free to act according to any decision rule , groups tend to choose the majority - vote protocol if information broadcast is uniform across all group members @xcite .",
    "however , if information broadcast is not uniform , groups adjust their decision protocol , often following a `` majority with exceptions '' rule , where majority - vote is followed unless one or more group members has an opposing opinion with a high confidence level .    in our experiment ,",
    "participants are assigned to groups without their input .",
    "other types of `` forced '' groups that have been defined in advance include workplace teams and military units .",
    "however , individuals may still refuse to comply with the rest of the group or `` opt out '' of group action , e.g. , going awol from a military base .",
    "future experiments will explore the contrast between `` forced '' group behavior with the naturally - arising collective behavior of `` self - assembling '' groups of humans or animals ( e.g. , fish schools and bird flocks ) .",
    "the participants of this experiment were mostly undergraduate students , the majority of whom were male ( fig [ fig : facestats ] ) .",
    "evacuation decisions are highly influenced by age , socioeconomic status , geographic location , household size , and responsibility for children ( the presence of which tend to encourage evacuation ) or the elderly ( which discourage evacuation ) @xcite @xcite",
    ". risk perception also varies with age , cultural background , and experience @xcite .",
    "future studies will target participants from different demographic backgrounds in order to further probe the relationship between demographics and decision making .",
    "* concluding remarks .",
    "* in natural and man - made disasters , information on the progression and magnitude of an impending disaster is distributed through a combination of global broadcast networks ( e.g. , television , radio , and the internet ) and social networks ( e.g. , facebook , twitter , and text messaging ) . the former is generally associated with news organizations that present information in a formal , edited manner , while the latter is generally based upon informal direct observations made by individuals in the population .    increasingly , the speed of information flow over social networks outpaces traditional broadcast communications , creating new opportunities to inform the public at unprecedented rates .",
    "however , along with fast - paced updates , social media viewed as a disaster communication tool introduces new and potentially dangerous fragilities associated with asynchronous , non - uniform , and incorrect updates that are intrinsic to unfiltered , open - access communication , yet are currently not well characterized .",
    "future extensions of our experimental platform will address these issues by incorporating asynchronous information updates within the population , spread and detection of misinformation , self - assembly and disassembly of groups , and realistic topography and transportation routes in order to develop increasingly realistic scenarios for human decision modeling .",
    "although this paper details a relatively small - scale experiment in a controlled and simplified setting , our findings may be extended to guide the development of policies for collective action in more complex situations of stress and uncertainty .",
    "decisions to evacuate in the face of impending disaster may depend not only on the current weather forecast , for example , but also on the volatility of the weather conditions over the past several hours , as reflected by our model , which takes into account both current parameters and those within a recent time window , as well as other trial - dependent factors such as overall shelter capacity and group size .",
    "moreover , the prevalence of sub - optimal decisions and non - bayesian strategy adjustments over time observed in our experiments serves as a precautionary guide to the development of large - scale , agent - based simulations of evacuations .",
    "this paper also addresses the limitations of extending characteristics of individuals without consideration of social influence to predict the behavior of groups .",
    "our results indicate significant differences in behavior between group sizes and protocols , and our observation that individual decision making does not generally predict strategy or rank in group action mandates the incorporation of social factors in computational modeling and design of optimized infrastructure and action protocols in preparation for natural or man - made disasters .",
