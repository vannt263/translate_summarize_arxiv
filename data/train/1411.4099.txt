    "condensed matter physics has been concentrating largely on finding different states of matters .",
    "one of the greatest recent achievements is the discovery of new form of states by applying the concept of topology which distinguish the states from the others characterized by landau s symmetry breaking theory@xcite .",
    "this progress starts from the finding of the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas@xcite , and then immediately causes wide interests@xcite .",
    "it was found that the kubo s formula for quantized hall conductance lead to the topological invariant@xcite .",
    "different states with distinguished conductance have the same symmetry and hence can not be classified by the broken symmetries .    while the large magnetic field in the qhe system limits its possible applications , scientists proposed a new kind of insulating state without the magnetic field@xcite .",
    "the spin up and the spin down electrons have the same hall conductance but with opposite signs leading to the so - called quantum spin hall effect as well as the 2d topological insulator , owing to the spin - orbit couplings .",
    "experimentally , this new state of matters have been observed and well studied in @xmath0 quantum well as well as in alloys like @xmath1 and @xmath2@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the development of optical lattices in cold atom physics has also stimulated the exploration for topological states@xcite .",
    "the 2d topological insulators have been extended to three - dimensional systems . on the other hand ,",
    "the 1d systems are usually supposed to be topologically trivial . because topology arises as the brillouin zone ( bz ) forms a torus and the wave vectors in both the @xmath3 and @xmath4-direction",
    "are needed . in recent years",
    ", some researchers have shown nontrivial topological properties in 1d systems by introducing a system parameter as a virtual dimension@xcite .",
    "it has been proved that these properties are relevant to higher dimensional space@xcite .",
    "for example , a shift @xmath5 of the periodic potential in the 1d harper model is introduced to make the hamiltonian periodic in the parameter space .",
    "this potential shift plays the role of the bloch vector in the @xmath4-direction .    as the hamiltonian is periodic for both @xmath6 and @xmath5 , the effective 2d bz forms a torus . in the qhe",
    ", the existence of edge states manifests the topological order . for 1d case",
    ", the edge states also appear in the band gap in which the electrons are localized at the edge . in the present work ,",
    "we study the topological properties in 1d periodic potentials , in either discrete or continuous systems .",
    "we show that the nonzero chern numbers for the energy bands . we also demonstrate that the particle pumping driven by adiabatic shift of the periodic potential is quantized and is intimately related to the topological chern number .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii we present the model and display the band structures , both in the discrete model and in the continuous model . in the open boundary condition",
    "there are edge states present in the energy gaps . in sec.iii",
    "we compute the chern numbers of the individual energy band . in sec.iv",
