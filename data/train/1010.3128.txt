    "the  motivation for this work comes from our attempts to create novel metrics for quantifying , comparing and cataloging large sets of complicated varying geometric patterns .",
    "random fields ( for a general background , see  @xcite , as well as the references therein ) provide a framework in which to approach these problems and have , over the last few decades , emerged as an important tool for studying spatial phenomena which involve an element of randomness  @xcite . for the types of applications , we have in mind  @xcite , we are often satisfied with a topological classification of sub- or super - level sets of a scalar function .",
    "algebraic topology , and in particular homology , can be used in a computationally efficient manner  @xcite to coarsely quantify these geometric properties . in past work",
    "@xcite , we developed a probabilistic framework for assessing the correctness of homology computations for random fields via uniform discretizations .",
    "the  approach considers the homology of nodal domains of random fields which are given by classical fourier series in one and two space dimensions , and it provides explicit and sharp error bounds as a function of the discretization size and averaged sobolev norms of the random field . while we do not claim it is trivial ",
    "there are complicated combinatorial questions that need to be resolved ",
    "we believe that it is possible to extend the methods and hence the results of  @xcite to higher - dimensional domains .     where  @xmath0 are independent standard gaussian random variables . in the left diagram , we consider random periodic functions , that is , the basis functions  @xmath1 are given by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , in the right diagram they are the chebyshev polynomials @xmath4 . in each case , we choose @xmath5 . ]",
    "the  more serious restriction in  @xcite is the use of periodic random fields , which due to the fact that the associated spatial correlation function is homogeneous , simplifies many of the estimates . in general",
    ", however , one expects to encounter nonhomogeneous random fields . in such cases",
    ", it seems unreasonable to expect that uniform sampling provides the optimal choice .",
    "for example , in figure  [ figsample ] , three sample functions each are shown for a random sum involving periodic basis functions and chebyshev polynomials .",
    "as one would expect , the zeros of the random chebyshev sum are more closely spaced at the boundary , and therefore small uniform discretization are most likely not optimal for determining the topology of the nodal domains .    with this as motivation , we allow for a more general sampling technique .",

    "their main focus , however , was the estimation of excursion probabilities , that is , the likelihood that a given random function exceeds a certain threshold . in  @xcite , it is shown that such excursion probabilities can be well - approximated by studying the geometry of random sub- or super - level sets of random fields . more precisely , it is shown that the expected value of the euler characteristic of super - level sets approximates excursion probabilities for large values of the threshold , and that it is possible to derive explicit formulas for the expected values of the euler characteristic and other intrinsic volumes of nodal domains of random fields .",
    "all of the above results concern the intrinsic volumes of the nodal domains  which are additive set functionals , and therefore computable via local considerations alone  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in previous work  @xcite we have demonstrated that the homological analysis of patterns of nodal sets can uncover phenomena that can not be captured using for example only the euler characteristic .",
    "the  more detailed information on the geometry of patterns encoded in homology is an inherently global quantity and can not be computed through local considerations alone . on the other hand ,",
    "recent computational advances allow for the fast computation of homological information based on discretized nodal domains .",
    "for this reason , we focus on the interface between the discretization and the underlying nodal domain , rather than the homology of the nodal domain directly , and then quantify the likelihood of error in the probabilistic setting . in this sense ,",
    "our approach complements the above - mentioned results on the geometry of random fields by adler and taylor  @xcite .",
    "given the current activity surrounding the ideas of using topological methods for data analysis and remote sensing  @xcite , we believe the importance of this perspective will grow .",
    "thus , the title of our paper is chosen in part to encourage the interested reader to consider the natural generalizations of this work to higher - dimensional domains where the question becomes one of optimizing the homology of the generalized nodal sets in terms of homology computed using a complex derived from a nonuniform sampling of space ."
