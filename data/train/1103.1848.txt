    "we review how generalized unitarity permits the efficient reconstruction of multi - loop amplitudes from tree amplitudes . in we",
    "show how the combination of unitarity and the klt relations simplifies the computation of @xmath0 supergravity loop amplitudes , by relating them to ( planar and non - planar ) loop amplitudes in @xmath1 super - yang - mills theory .",
    "finally , in we describe the four - graviton amplitudes that have been determined at two , three and four loops using these methods , and we discuss their ultraviolet properties .",
    "we present our conclusions in .",
    "in field theory , ultraviolet divergences are associated with local counterterms .",
    "the divergences that survive in on - shell scattering amplitudes should respect the symmetries of the theory ; in theories of gravity the counterterms should be generally covariant .",
    "thus they are expressible as products of the riemann tensor @xmath5 , along with covariant derivatives @xmath6 acting on it .",
    "( if matter is present , then the energy momentum tensor @xmath7 can also appear . )",
    "the loop - counting parameter @xmath8 has mass dimension @xmath9 , while the riemann tensor has mass dimension 2 : @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , by dimensional analysis , an @xmath11-loop counterterm has the generic form ( suppressing all lorentz indices ) @xmath12 for some power @xmath13 .",
    "nonlinear field redefinitions of the einstein action allow the removal of the ricci tensor @xmath14 and scalar @xmath15 from potential counterterms . after making such redefinitions ,",
    "the only available one - loop counterterm ( in a theory of pure gravity ) , @xmath16 , is equivalent to the gauss - bonnet term .",
    "the latter is a total derivative , and can not be generated in perturbation theory .",
    "this fact explains why pure gravity is finite at one loop , although there are divergences if matter is present  @xcite .    in any pure supergravity theory , _",
    "i.e. _  one in which all states are related by supersymmetry to the graviton , there are also no divergences at two loops .",
    "the reason is that the unique potential counterterm , @xmath17 , is incompatible with @xmath18 supersymmetry . when sandwiched between four graviton plane - wave states , @xmath19 produces a nonzero matrix element  @xcite for helicity configurations @xmath20 that are forbidden by supersymmetry ward identities  @xcite .",
    "again , if matter super - multiplets are present , other counterterms are available , and lower - loop divergences are possible , even at one loop  @xcite .    in pure supergravity , the first potential",
    "counterterm appears at three loops  @xcite , and is often abbreviated as @xmath21 .",
    "it has long been known to be compatible with not just @xmath18 supersymmetry , but the full @xmath0 , because it appears as the first subleading term ( after the einstein action ) in the low - energy limit of the four - graviton scattering amplitude in type ii closed superstring theory  @xcite , r^4    invariants are @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 stands for any of the @xmath26 four - point amplitudes in @xmath27 supergravity ( after removing the gravitational coupling constant ) .",
    "the @xmath21 operator was ruled out as a counterterm for @xmath0 supergravity by analyzing the ultraviolet behavior of the three - loop four - graviton amplitude  @xcite ( see ) .",
    "recently , elvang , freedman and kiermaier  @xcite studied the constraints of @xmath0 supersymmetry on counterterms of higher operator dimension , and also with more than four powers of the riemann tensor .",
    "the latter only affect amplitudes with more than four external legs .",
    "the first non - vanishing @xmath28-graviton tree amplitudes are the maximally - helicity - violating ( mhv ) ones , which contain two negative graviton helicities , and @xmath29 positive helicities . for mhv amplitudes , the supersymmetry ward identities  @xcite imply that the amplitudes , divided by a simple prefactor , are bose symmetric  @xcite .",
    "all non - vanishing four - point amplitudes are mhv ( for gravitons only , the only non - vanishing case is @xmath30 ) .",
    "therefore @xmath0-supersymmetric on - shell counterterms of the form @xmath31 can be classified in terms of bose - symmetric polynomials @xmath32 of degree @xmath33 , where @xmath34 .",
    "this analysis leads to one independent operator each of the form @xmath21 and @xmath31 for @xmath35 , with multiple operators appearing first at order @xmath36 . by dimensional analysis ,",
    "@xmath31 counterterms are associated with divergences in @xmath37 at loop order @xmath38 .",
    "all five - point amplitudes are mhv as well ( for gravitons only , either @xmath39 or its parity conjugate ) , so the bose - symmetry constraints ( in more variables ) are still valid .",
    "for @xmath40 , a much more sophisticated analysis of the @xmath0 supersymmetry ward identities on next - to - mhv amplitudes is required  @xcite .",
    "the upshot is that @xmath0 supersymmetry alone is sufficient to rule out all counterterms through seven loops except for @xmath21 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "( earlier work ruled out the four - loop counterterms @xmath43 and @xmath44  @xcite . )",
    "however , there is another constraint on counterterms in @xmath0 supergravity in @xmath37 , and that is invariance under the continuous symmetry @xmath4 , a non - compact form of the exceptional lie group @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "the theory contains 70 massless scalars , which parametrize the coset space @xmath46 .",
    "the non-@xmath47 part of @xmath4 is realized nonlinearly , through motions on the coset manifold parametrized by the scalar fields . therefore it imposes another set of amplitude ward identities , which are associated with soft limits as the momentum of one or more scalar particles approaches zero  @xcite .",
    "for example , in the limit that a single scalar becomes soft , all the matrix elements of a potential counterterm should vanish .",
    "if @xmath4 is also a symmetry at the quantum level , then these properties can be used to constrain potential counterterms .",
    "the @xmath47 subgroup of @xmath4 was shown to be non - anomalous at one - loop long ago  @xcite .",
    "more recently , bossard , hillmann and nicolai  @xcite , using a formulation for the vector fields that has manifest electric - magnetic duality , but is not lorentz covariant , have extended this result to the full @xmath4 symmetry , and to all orders in perturbation theory .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found that the single - soft - scalar limit was non - vanishing for the operator @xmath48 generated by string theory , where @xmath49 is the dilaton ( plus terms generated by @xmath0 supersymmetry ) .",
    "this result suggested that the @xmath21 operator might be ruled out as a counterterm . a more refined analysis  @xcite isolated the matrix elements generated solely by the @xmath47-singlet operator @xmath21 ( _ i.e. _  removing effects of the dilaton ) , and still found a nonvanishing single - soft limit , thereby demonstrating at the amplitude level that the @xmath21 counterterm is not allowed by linearized @xmath4 .",
    "later this analysis was extended  @xcite to a large set of higher - dimension operators , and has served to rule out , via @xmath4 , the @xmath41 and @xmath42 potential counterterms mentioned above , as well as to constrain the potential seven - loop counterterm to have a unique form , corresponding to @xmath50 ( plus terms generated by @xmath0 supersymmetry ; see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in other words ,",
    "the seven - loop finiteness of @xmath0 supergravity in @xmath37 can be assessed purely by computing the four - graviton scattering amplitude .",
    "similar conclusions about the finiteness of @xmath0 supergravity through seven loops ( as well as results concerning first divergences in higher - dimensional versions of the theory ) , were arrived at in ref .",
    "@xcite , based also on the @xmath4 invariance of counterterms , but using three different lines of analysis , including the dimensional reduction of higher - dimensional counterterms .    a seven - loop , @xmath0 supersymmetric counterterm was constructed long ago  @xcite , but that construction was not manifestly @xmath4 invariant .",
    "more recently it was found  @xcite that this candidate counterterm can be identified with the volume of the on - shell @xmath0 superspace , and that it is @xmath4 invariant , although it is still possible that it vanishes after using the classical field equations .",
    "however , it seems more likely that the volume coincides with the @xmath50 potential counterterm that passes the @xmath4 constraints also studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , ref .",
    "@xcite has discussed the constraints from @xmath4 in the context of a light - cone superspace approach , and argues that the theory is perturbatively finite to all loop orders .",
    "even if a counterterm is allowed by all known symmetries , that does not necessarily mean that its coefficient is nonzero . only an explicit computation can determine this property for certain .",
    "seven - loop four - graviton scattering amplitudes are still a bit beyond present technology .",
    "however , the four - loop amplitude can , and has been , computed  @xcite , and furthermore it also allows access to the @xmath50 potential counterterm , albeit in a different spacetime dimension .    in general , we can test the ultraviolet behavior of the four - graviton scattering amplitude in @xmath0 supergravity at any loop order @xmath11 by increasing the spacetime dimension @xmath51 associated with the loop - momentum integration , until the amplitude starts to diverge .",
    "it is instructive to compare this behavior with the corresponding behavior of the maximally supersymmetric gauge theory , @xmath1 super - yang - mills theory ( @xmath1 sym ) .",
    "the latter theory is known to be finite to all loop orders in @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "however , it diverges in @xmath52 .",
    "the critical dimension @xmath53 , in which the theory first diverges as @xmath51 increases , depends on the number of loops , and is given by the formula  @xcite ,",
    "d_c(l)|_sym  =  4 + ( l>1 ) . [ neq4dcl ] the surprising result from the four - graviton computations to be described below , is that , through four loops , @xmath0 supergravity is just as well behaved , d_c(l)|_sugra  =  4 + ( l=2,3,4 ) . [ neq8dcl ] in both theories , the one - loop case is special , and the first divergence is in eight dimensions ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "clearly , the equality between  ( [ neq4dcl ] ) and ( [ neq8dcl ] ) must break at some point , if @xmath0 supergravity is to diverge in four dimensions .    for @xmath1 sym ,",
    "the divergences in the critical dimension are all associated with a single type of counterterm , for @xmath55 , of the general form @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the gluon field strength and the color structure is generic .",
    "given this fact , and recalling that the loop - counting parameter for gauge theory is dimensionless , while that for gravity is dimensionful , @xmath3 , the only way that the two formulas for @xmath53 can coincide , is if each successive @xmath0 supergravity divergence in the critical dimension for @xmath58 is associated with a counterterm with two more derivatives ( additional powers of the curvature beyond @xmath21 would not produce a divergence in the four - graviton amplitude ) .",
    "indeed , the associated higher - dimensional counterterms have the form @xmath59 , @xmath58 .",
    "thus the @xmath50 potential counterterm would correspond to the divergence of the four - loop four - graviton scattering amplitude in @xmath60 .",
    "( we do not yet know for sure whether the amplitude diverges in this dimension ; we do know that it does not diverge in lower dimensions . )    furthermore , when the divergence in the five - loop amplitude is computed , one of two things must happen : either ( 1 ) the equality of eqs .",
    "( [ neq4dcl ] ) and ( [ neq8dcl ] ) must break , or else ( 2 ) the appropriate operator for describing the five - loop divergence in the critical dimension must be @xmath61 . because this operator has two _ more _ derivatives on it than the potential seven - loop counterterm in @xmath37 , @xmath62 , possibility ( 2 )",
    "would be a strong indicator that this counterterm is not present .",
    "on the other hand , there have been predictions , based on the general structure of contributions in a world - line formalism using the non - minimal pure spinor formalism  @xcite , that the equally good ultraviolet behavior of @xmath0 supergravity and @xmath1 sym will break at five loops .",
    "clearly the ultraviolet behavior of the five - loop four - graviton amplitude is an important outstanding question , which will shed strong light on the potential seven - loop divergence of @xmath0 supergravity in four dimensions .    in the remainder of this contribution",
    ", we will outline the technical tools that have made possible the computation of the complete four - graviton scattering amplitude in @xmath0 supergravity through four loops , as well as the extraction of its ultraviolet divergence in the appropriate higher spacetime dimensions .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , tree amplitudes in gravity can be expressed in terms of tree amplitudes in gauge theory , specifically as bilinear combinations of gauge amplitudes .",
    "the reason this will prove so useful to us is that , by using generalized unitarity , we will be able to chop the gravity loop amplitudes up into products of gravity trees .",
    "then we can use the gravity - gauge relations to write everything in terms of products of gauge - theory trees , products which actually appear in cuts of gauge loop amplitudes . in this way",
    ", multi - loop gauge amplitudes provide the information needed to construct multi - loop gravity amplitudes .",
    "the original gravity - gauge tree amplitude relations were found by kawai , lewellen and tye  @xcite , who recognized that the world - sheet integrands needed to compute tree - level amplitudes in the closed type ii superstring theory were essentially the square of the integrands appearing in the open - superstring tree amplitudes .",
    "klt represented the closed - string world - sheet integrals over the complex plane as products of contour integrals , and then deformed the contours until they could be identified as integrals for open - string amplitudes , thus deriving relations between closed- and open - string tree amplitudes .    because the low - energy limit of the perturbative sector of the closed type ii superstring in @xmath37 is @xmath0 supergravity , and that of the open superstring is @xmath1 sym  @xcite , as the string tension goes to infinity the klt relations express any @xmath0 supergravity tree amplitude in terms of amplitudes in @xmath1 sym .",
    "more recently , there have been a variety of studies of `` klt - type '' relations from various perspectives  @xcite .",
    "one set of relations , found by three of the present authors  @xcite , follows from  @xcite a color - kinematic duality satisfied by gauge theory amplitudes .",
    "these relations promise to greatly simplify future computations of @xmath0 supergravity loop amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "however , in this article we will only describe the use of the klt relations , because those were employed in the two- , three- and four - loop supergravity computations reviewed here .    the klt relations for @xmath0 supergravity amplitudes are bilinear in the @xmath1 sym amplitudes , for two complementary reasons : ( 1 ) integrals over the complex plane naturally break up into pairs of contour integrals , and ( 2 ) the @xmath0 supergravity fock space naturally factors into a product of `` left '' and `` right '' @xmath1 sym fock spaces ,  =  [ ] _ l [ ] _ r .",

    ", @xmath146 is the @xmath51-dimensional measure for the @xmath147 loop momentum .",
    "the numerator polynomial @xmath148 is a polynomial in both internal and external momenta .",
    "the color factor @xmath149 can be written as a product of structure constants @xmath150 for the gauge group .",
    "it can also be written diagrammatically , using three - vertices for @xmath150 factors , and lines ( propagators ) for @xmath151 contractions . in this form , it is given just by the associated cubic graph .",
    "these integrands can then be cut in any desired fashion . through the klt relations",
    ", they provide the data needed to evaluate very efficiently the generalized cuts for @xmath0 supergravity .",
    "in particular , the @xmath0 supergravity cuts require a sum over the 256 states in the @xmath0 supergravity multiplet , for every cut line .",
    "however , the corresponding cut @xmath1 sym loop integrands already contain a sum over the 16 states in the @xmath1 sym multiplet .",
    "the klt relations express the @xmath0 supergravity cuts as sums of products of two copies of @xmath1 sym cuts .",
    "the @xmath0 sum factorizes as , _  =  _ [ ] _ l _ [ ] _ r  , and the @xmath1 sums have already been carried out in the course of constructing the @xmath1 sym integrand .    because gravity has no notion of color , planar and non - planar contributions",
    "can not be separated in graviton amplitudes .",
    "the klt relations therefore must relate the gravity cuts to both planar and non - planar gauge theory cuts .",

    "5^(4,_4,3,_3,_5 ) + ( 3,4 ) . in this way",
    ", both occurrences of the four - point @xmath1 sym amplitude carry the same cyclic ordering as the @xmath0 supergravity one , as shown in the figure .",
    "one of the two five - point amplitudes carries the same ordering , as shown in the left copy .",
    "this copy can be evaluated using the planar @xmath1 sym amplitude .",
    "the other five - point amplitude is twisted , leading to the right copy , which is non - planar , so it requires non - planar terms in the @xmath1 sym amplitude .",
    "a reflection symmetry under the permutation @xmath153 is preserved by this representation . the two - fold permutation sum in @xmath154 in leads to a four - fold permutation sum in the figure ; one must add the permutations @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 .",
    "note that for terms that are detected in the maximal cuts , because of the simple relation between gravity and gauge three - point amplitudes ( ) , the numerator factors are always simply squared in passing from gauge theory to gravity .",
    "4.7 truein    the full two - loop four - point amplitude in @xmath1 sym is given by  @xcite a_4^&= & - s_12 s_23 a_4^ , [ twoloopym ] where @xmath158 are the scalar planar and non - planar double box integrals shown in , and @xmath159 are color factors constructed from structure constant vertices , with the same graphical structure as the corresponding integral .",
    "the quantity @xmath160 is totally symmetric under gluon interchange , and its square is the @xmath21 matrix element in , up to a factor of @xmath107 .",
    "because all terms in are detected by the maximal cuts , the complete two - loop four - point amplitude in @xmath0 supergravity is found simply by squaring the prefactors in ( and removing the color factors , as appropriate for gravity ) : m_4^&= & -i ( s_12 s_23 a_4^)^2 + & = & s_12 s_23",

    "this type of counterterm is permitted by the field - theoretic duality constraints of ref .",
    "@xcite .      at three loops ,",
    "the integrand of the @xmath1 sym four - point amplitude begins to have dependence on the loop - momentum in its numerator , as well as ( non - planar ) terms that can not be detected in the maximal cuts .",
    "for this reason , the three - loop @xmath0 supergravity amplitude , in its initial two forms  @xcite , was not given by simply squaring the @xmath1 sym results  except for a subset of the graphs that could be inferred using only two - particle cuts .",
    "more recently , three of the present authors rearranged the three - loop @xmath1 sym amplitude so as to make manifest its color - kinematic duality  @xcite . in this form",
    "the @xmath0 supergravity amplitude can once again be found by a simple squaring procedure . here",
    "we will give the amplitudes in the form found in ref .",

    "comparing the two sets of numerators , we see that the @xmath0 supergravity ones are the squares of the @xmath1 sym ones , up to contact terms , as expected from the klt relations . for example , in graphs ( e)(g ) , @xmath169 , so @xmath170 ^ 2 $ ] ( modulo @xmath136 terms ) .    because the numerator factors for both @xmath0 supergravity and @xmath1 sym are manifestly quadratic in the loop momenta , the critical dimensions @xmath53 at three loops remain equal , @xmath171 for @xmath172 .",
    "indeed , when the ultraviolet poles in the integrals for @xmath0 supergravity are evaluated , no further cancellation is found , and the resulting pole is m_4^ ,  d=6 - 2 |_pole = 5 _ 3(4)^9 ( s_12 s_23 s_13)^2 m_4^ , .3 cm [ threeloopd6div ] corresponding to a counterterm of the form @xmath42 in @xmath173 .",

    "@xcite ; however , the rational number predicted there does not agree with .",

    ". one can start by classifying the cubic vacuum graphs . at three loops",
    "there were only two ; at four loops there are five , shown in .",

    "altogether there are 50 cubic four - point graphs with nonvanishing numerators .",
    "graphs ( b ) and ( c ) do generate four - point graphs without triangles , but the numerators for all such graphs can be determined , up to possible contact terms , by iterated two - particle cuts . because of the structure of these cuts  @xcite , the associated numerator polynomials turn out to be very simple .",
    "graphs ( d ) , and particularly ( e ) , give rise to the most complex numerators .",
    "5.6 truein    the method of maximal cuts was used to determine the numerator polynomials for @xmath1 sym . at four loops ,",
    "the maximal cuts have 13 cut conditions @xmath137 .",
    "then near - maximal cuts with only 12 cut conditions are considered , followed by ones with 11 cut conditions . at this point",
    "the @xmath1 sym ansatz is complete ; no more terms need to be added .",
    "the result was verified by comparison against a spanning set of generalized cuts .    in",
    "we show three of the 50 numerator polynomials .",
    "these three are associated with the one non - planar cubic vacuum graph ( e ) , and they have the most complex numerators .",
    "integral ( 50 ) is required for the ansatz for the integrand to match various cuts .",
    "however , it integrates to zero and has vanishing color factor , so it does not contribute to the @xmath1 sym amplitude . in constructing the amplitude",
    ", it proved very useful to have simple pictorial rules that allow one to generate numerator polynomials for many graphs from those for other graphs , either at the same loop order or at lower loop order .",
    "an old rule  @xcite , called the _",
    "rung rule _",
    ", applies whenever a graph has a two - particle cut .",
    "a newer rule is the _ box cut rule _",
    "it can be applied to any graph that contains a four - point subdiagram , and it generates that graph s numerator polynomial ( modulo certain contact terms ) from the polynomials associated with particular lower - loop graphs .",
    "together , these rules are quite powerful ; of the 50 graphs , only four have neither two - particle cuts nor box cuts .",
    "( three of the four appear in . )",
    "after the @xmath1 sym amplitude was computed , the 50 numerator polynomials for the @xmath0 supergravity amplitude were then constructed , using information provided by the klt relations .",
    "the results are quite lengthy , but are provided as mathematica readable files in ref .",
    "@xcite , along with some tools for manipulating them .    from the numerator polynomials for the @xmath0 supergravity amplitude , the amplitude s ultraviolet behavior could be extracted , by expanding the integrals in the limit of small external momenta , relative to the loop momenta  @xcite . unlike the three - loop representations in refs .",
    "@xcite , the ultraviolet behavior for the form in ref .",
    "@xcite is not manifest .",
    "that means that each integral is more divergent than the sum , and hence subleading terms in the expansion are required .",
    "it is necessary to expand to third order , in order to show that @xmath0 supergravity is as well behaved as @xmath1 sym at four loops , in this representation of the amplitude .",
    "more concretely , the numerator polynomials , omitting an overall factor of @xmath174 , have a mass dimension of 12 , _",
    "i.e. _  each term is of the form @xmath175 , where @xmath33 and @xmath176 stand respectively for external and loop momenta .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath117 turns out to be 8 for every integral .",
    "the integrals all have 13 propagators , so they have the form @xmath177 .",
    "the amplitude is manifestly finite in @xmath37 , because @xmath178 .",
    "( this result is not unexpected , given the absence of a @xmath43 counterterm  @xcite . )",
    "the amplitude is not manifestly finite in @xmath179 ; to see that requires cancellation of the @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 terms , after expansion around small @xmath33 .",
    "the cancellation of the @xmath180 terms is relatively simple , because one can simply set the external momenta @xmath108 to zero inside the integrals that appear . at this point",
    ", the potentially divergent integrals all reduce to one of two types of scalar vacuum integrals  there are no loop - momentum tensors appearing in the numerator , and no doubled propagator factors in the denominator .",
    "in fact , only two of the five vacuum graphs in appear , ( d ) and ( e ) . collecting all terms , one finds that the coefficients of ( d ) and ( e ) both vanish .",
    "the cancellation of the @xmath181 terms ( and the @xmath183 terms ) is trivial : using dimensional regularization , with no dimensionful parameter , lorentz invariance does not allow an odd - power divergence .",
    "the most intricate cancellation is that of the @xmath182 terms , corresponding to the vanishing of the coefficient of the potential counterterm @xmath42 in @xmath179 . in the expansion of the integrals to the second subleading order as @xmath184 ,",
    "thirty different four - loop vacuum integrals are generated .",
    "these integrals often have doubled ( and sometimes tripled ) propagators , arising from the taylor expansion of the loop - momentum integrand in the external momentum .",
    "some integrals also contain tensors in the loop - momentum in their numerators . however , there are consistency relations between the integrals , corresponding to the ability to shift the loop momenta by external momenta before expanding around @xmath185 .",
    "these consistency relations are powerful enough to imply the cancellation of the ultraviolet pole in @xmath186 . as a check",
    ", we evaluated all 30 ultraviolet poles directly , with the same conclusion .",
    "we did not yet evaluate the ultraviolet pole near @xmath187 ( the critical dimension for @xmath1 sym at this loop order ) , so in principle it could cancel , although that seems unlikely to be the case .    in summary ,",
    "the four - loop four - point amplitude of @xmath0 supergravity is ultraviolet finite for @xmath188  @xcite , the same bound found for @xmath1 super - yang - mills theory .",
    "finiteness in @xmath189 is a consequence of nontrivial cancellations , beyond those already found at three loops  @xcite .",
    "these results provide the strongest direct support to date for the possibility that @xmath0 supergravity might be a perturbatively finite quantum theory of gravity .",
    "in every explicit computation to date , through four loops , the ultraviolet behavior of @xmath0 supergravity has proven to be no worse than that of @xmath1 super - yang - mills theory . on the other hand ,",
    "there are several recent arguments  @xcite in favor of the existence of a seven - loop counterterm  @xcite of the form @xmath50 .",
    "as argued in , the five - loop four - graviton scattering amplitude , when evaluated in higher dimensions for the loop momentum , should provide a fairly decisive test for what will happen at seven loops .",
    "although this computation is difficult , it may well prove feasible using new ideas related to the color - kinematic duality  @xcite .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 supergravity turns out to be finite to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "this result still would not prove that it is a consistent theory of quantum gravity at the non - perturbative level .",
    "there are at least two reasons to think that it might need a non - perturbative ultraviolet completion :    1 .",
    "the ( likely ) @xmath190 or worse growth of the coefficients of the order @xmath11 terms in the perturbative expansion , which for fixed - angle scattering , would imply a non - convergent behavior @xmath191 .",
    "2 .   the fact that the perturbative series seems to be @xmath4 invariant , while the mass spectrum of black holes is non - invariant ( see _ e.g. _  ref .",
    "@xcite for recent discussions ) .",
    "qed is an example of a perturbatively well - defined theory that needs an ultraviolet completion ; it also has factorial growth in its perturbative coefficients , @xmath192 , due to ultraviolet renormalons associated with the landau pole . yet for small values of @xmath193 qed",
    "works extremely well : it predicts the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron to 10 digits of accuracy .",
    "also , there are many pointlike non - perturbative ultraviolet completions for qed , namely asymptotically free grand unified theories . are there any imaginable pointlike completions for @xmath0 supergravity ?",
    "maybe the only completion is string theory ; or maybe this can not happen because of the impossibility of decoupling non - perturbative string states not present in @xmath0 supergravity  @xcite .    another question is whether @xmath0 supergravity might point the way to other , more realistic finite ( or well behaved ) theories of quantum gravity , having less supersymmetry and ( perhaps ) chiral fermions .",
    "one step in this direction could be to examine the multi - loop behavior of theories that can be thought of as spontaneously broken gauged @xmath0 supergravity  @xcite , which are known to have improved ultraviolet behavior at one loop  @xcite .    in any event",
    ", the excellent perturbative ultraviolet behavior of @xmath0 supergravity has already provided many surprises .",
    "although the theory may not itself be of direct phenomenological interest , perhaps it will some day lead to more realistic theories also having excellent ultraviolet behavior . as a `` toy model '' for a pointlike theory of quantum gravity , it has been extremely instructive , and further",
