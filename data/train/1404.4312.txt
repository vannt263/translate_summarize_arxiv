    "the _ level persistence _ for a real valued map was first considered in @xcite and @xcite and thought as a refinement of the standard persistence ( referred below as _ sub - level persistence _ ) .",
    "it turned out to be a particular case of a more general persistence theory , the _ zigzag persistence _ proposed by carlsson and silva cf.@xcite .",
    "the numerical invariants we have proposed for level persistence are the _ relevant persistence numbers _ and are equivalent with the four types of bar codes which came out from _ zigzag persistence_. their merits consist in the fact that they can be calculated using standard persistence algorithms with minor adjustments . in @xcite we have indicated how to calculate these numbers for a simplicial map via persistence algorithms slightly modified .",
    "the purpose of this note is to make this relationship precise .    in order to explain this we review the meaning of level persistence versus sub - level persistence and explain , from our perspective , the significance of bar codes and of relevant persistence numbers .",
    "we inform the reader that the bar codes proposed by carlsson and silva are based on graph representations and derived decomposing the representations associated to the map in indecomposable components .",
    "our approach is different .",
    "we propose here two concepts _ death _",
    "( left and right ) and _ observability or detectability _ ( left and right ) . the class of maps for which level persistence is naturally defined based on these two concepts is the class of _ tame maps_. so far all maps which appear in practice are tame . in particular any simplicial map @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a finite simplicial complex and @xmath2 is linear on each simplex , and any morse function are tame .",
    "tameness of a map actually signifies that the topology of the level changes at a discrete collection of values ( referred to as critical values ) .",
    "precisely ,    [ tamemap ]    a continuous map @xmath3 is called * tame map * ( cf .",
    "definition 3.5 , @xcite ) if @xmath1 is a compact anr and there exists finitely many values @xmath4 ( so called critical values ) so that    \\(i ) for any @xmath5 there exists @xmath6 so that @xmath7 and the second factor projection @xmath8 are fiberwise homotopy equivalent .",
    "\\(ii ) for any @xmath9 there exists @xmath6 so that canonical inclusions @xmath10 and @xmath11 are deformation retractions .",
    "the definition can be extended to incorporate @xmath1 locally compact anr s and @xmath2 proper maps . instead of finite collection of critical values",
    "one requires that the set of critical values is a discrete sequence of numbers @xmath12 .",
    "one can show that a simplicial map is tame cf.@xcite , with the set of critical values being among the values of @xmath2 on vertices . in practice ,",
    "for a simplicial map , one can treat all values of @xmath2 on vertices as potential critical values .",
    "the sub - level persistence needs a weaker concept , referred here as weakly tame map , which requires the change in the topology of sub - levels appearing only at finitely many @xmath13s .",
    "precisely ,    [ wtamemap ]    a continuous map @xmath3 is called * weakly tame map * if @xmath1 is a compact anr and there exist finitely many values @xmath4 ( so called critical values ) so that for any @xmath14 the inclusion @xmath15}\\subseteq x_{(-\\infty , t]}$ ] is a homotopy equivalence ( for the purpose of sub - level persistence , homology equivalence suffices ) . as above the definition can be extended to locally compct anr s .",
    "clearly _ tameness _ implies _ weakly tameness_. the main results stated here are theorem [ theorem326 ] and theorem [ theorem327 ] in section [ ral ] and they were formulated in the author s ph.d thesis .",
    "as suggested , we begin this note with recollection of sub - level persistence ( section [ slp ] ) , then general considerations about level persistence ( section [ lp ] ) , and ultimately the relation between the relevant persistence numbers and bar codes ( section [ ral ] ) .",
    "note that when we refer to _ homology _ we mean homology with coefficients in a field @xmath16 fixed once for all .",
    "the case @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the most familiar . in this case",
    "the @xmath19-dimensional homology is a @xmath16-vector space and its dimension is referred to as betti number .",
    "the author thanks d. burghelea for advise and help .",
    "given a continuous map @xmath20 , the sub - level persistent homology introduced in @xcite and further developed in @xcite is concerned with the following questions :    q1 .",
    "does the class @xmath21 originates in @xmath22 for @xmath23 ? does the class @xmath21 vanishes in @xmath24 for @xmath25 ?",
    "what are the smallest @xmath13 and @xmath26 such that this happens ?",
    "the information that is contained in the linear maps @xmath27 for any @xmath28 is known as * sub - level persistence * and permits to answer the above questions .",
    "recall that sub - level * persistent homology * is the collection of vector spaces and linear maps @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath30 .",
    "one says that    \\(i ) the element @xmath31 is born at @xmath26 , @xmath23 , if @xmath32 is contained in img@xmath33 but is not contained in img@xmath34 for any @xmath6 .",

    "clearly a map provide a filtration by finitely many sub - levels if the map is weakly tame .",
    "conversely , the standard construction _ telescope _ in homotopy theory permits to replace any finite filtered space @xmath39 by a weakly tame map @xmath20 simply by taking @xmath40 \\cup_{\\phi_1 } k_1\\times [ t_1,t_2 ] \\cup_{\\phi_2}\\cdots\\cup_{\\phi_{n-1}}k_{n-1}\\times [ t_{n-1},t_n]\\cup_{\\phi_n}k_n$ ] where @xmath41 is the inclusion and @xmath42}$ ] the projection of @xmath43 $ ] on @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "the sub - level persistence for a filtered space is the sub - level persistence of the associated weakly tame map .",
