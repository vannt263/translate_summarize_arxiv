    "in recent years , the structure of the baryon resonances has been an important topic of both experimental and theoretical investigation .",
    "of particular interest is the @xmath1 resonance , the first excited state of the nucleon .",
    "new @xmath1 photo - production for large four - momentum transfer have been extracted in several laboratories , as jlab , mami , legs and mit - bates @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , lattice simulations were performed for both the @xmath3 @xcite and the @xmath2 @xcite transition form factors .",
    "this last transition can be described in terms of the jones and scadron multipole form factors @xcite : the magnetic dipole m1 ( @xmath4 ) , the electric e2 ( @xmath5 ) , and the coulomb c2 ( @xmath6 ) quadrupole form factors .",
    "the reaction is dominated by the magnetic dipole form factor @xmath4 . although constituent quark models ( cqm ) @xcite , with valence quark degrees of freedom only , are sufficient to explain some properties of the @xmath1 , they are not sufficient to explain the @xmath4 data at the physical point ( @xmath7 mev ) @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of chiral symmetry and/or a coupling of the quark to the pion field @xcite helps to overcome the limitations of the pure valence quark models .",
    "the importance of the pion field , or `` pion cloud '' , was also demonstrated using effective field theory @xcite and model reaction mechanisms based on the hadronic fields , known as dynamical models @xcite .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review of the @xmath2 transition .    in previous works we successfully described the nucleon @xcite , the @xmath3 @xcite and the @xmath2@xcite transitions , by considering a spectator quark model inspired by the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) mechanism .",
    "when we restrict the @xmath1 wavefunction to s - waves , the spectator valence quark model gives no contributions to the quadrupole form factors @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "those contributions emerge only when d - states are considered , consistent with other cqms @xcite .",
    "the d - states improve the description of the experimental data , but their contributions are in general small , with the quadrupole form factors at the physical point being dominated by the pion cloud  @xcite ( see also @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the dominance of the pion cloud at the physical point prevents an accurate calibration of the valence quark d - state contributions and , consequently , the relative amount of the contributions from d - waves only and the pion cloud is not yet exactly known @xcite .    the vmd mechanism , which we used to parametrize the electromagnetic interaction in terms of the hadronic masses , can also be used to extend the covariant spectator model to the lattice regime . by introducing the dependence of the hadronic masses on the lattice pion mass",
    "we could describe the lattice data for the nucleon @xcite and for the magnetic dipole form factor @xmath4 @xcite of the @xmath2 reaction , with only s - waves in both the nucleon and the @xmath1 wavefunctions @xcite .",
    "this motivated that in the present work we include d - states in the @xmath1 in wavefunction , to show whether the description of the lattice data is still possible , also for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 form factors .    in order to include the d - states , and to overcome the uncertainty discussed above on their effects , we start by realizing that the valence quark effects are expected to dominate for large pion masses , exactly when pion cloud effects are expected to be suppressed @xcite . in light of this ,",
    "lattice qcd , in particular in quenched approximation with @xmath8 mev , where the pion cloud effects are negligible @xcite , becomes the ideal laboratory to test the valence quark contributions , and to constrain the d - states .",
    "importantly , the dependence of the two sub - leading @xmath5 and @xmath6 form factors on the d - states allows then the extraction of very relevant information .    in this work",
    "we use the lattice information to determine more precisely the valence quark effects in the @xmath2 quadrupole form factors , and consider the contributions of the valence quark structure , including orbital d - states , in the regime of the lattice calculations .",
    "first , we started by making a direct application of the valence quark model fixed in the physical region ( @xmath9 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , to the quadrupole moments in the lattice region .",
    "although the model generates the correct order of magnitude of the lattice quadrupole data , it fails to reproduce their @xmath10 dependence .",
    "therefore , we inverted the procedure : we began by readjusting the @xmath1 model parametrization to the quenched lattice data , imposing an overall description of the lattice data for several values of the pion mass . from the resulting parametrization we generated directly the valence quark contribution of the orbital d - states to @xmath11 and @xmath12 at the physical point .",
    "finally , by adding a pion cloud contribution derived in the large-@xmath13 limit , which was established independently from our model , we obtain a successful description of the experimental data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ formalism ] we review the formalism associated with the spectator quark model ; in sec .  [ extension ] we explain how to generalize the model to the lattice qcd regime ; in sec .  [ lattice ] we present the results of that generalization ; in sec .  [ physical ] we present the predictions for the quadrupole form factors in the physical region and discuss the results ; finally in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] we draw conclusions .",
    "we consider a quark model based on the covariant spectator formalism @xcite . in this formalism",
    "the nucleon and the @xmath1 are described as a system of an off - mass - shell quark and two non - interacting quarks forming an on - mass - shell diquark @xcite .    in our model ,",
    "the quarks are effective degrees of freedom `` dressed '' by form factors , and the nucleon and @xmath1 wavefunctions are not derived from a dynamical wave equation , but given a parametric form consistent with the intrinsic symmetries of these systems . by construction @xcite the wavefunctions are covariant and reproduce their expected non - relativistic limits .",
    "the first feature is important for the application of the formalism to the kinematics of the recent data .",
    "the nucleon and @xmath1 wavefunction can be expressed in terms of a quark spin ( isospin ) state together with a spin-0 ( isospin-0 ) diquark state and a spin-1 ( isospin-1 ) vector diquark state @xcite , multiplied by a relative angular momentum state @xcite .",

    "with this procedure we avoid ambiguities related to the exact contribution of the pion cloud mechanisms and their entanglement with the d - wave effects .",

    "@xcite , where we used an indirect estimate of the valence quark contribution at the physical pion mass point , based on specific assumptions about the pion cloud contribution .",
    "another interesting point is that the d - state range parameters @xmath69 , with @xmath70 , do not spread over a large region , suggesting one single value , @xmath71 , as the signature range of the d - state regime , slightly larger than that of the s - state range @xmath72 .",
    "we note that , in this case , it is the additional power in the d - state scalar wavefunctions",

    "( [ eqpsis])-([eqpsid1 ] ) ) that implies a more peripheral character for those states , when compared with the s states .",
    "indeed , as for low @xmath73 , @xmath74 @xcite , a higher power in momentum space corresponds to a more peripheral effect in configuration space , as it is to be expected from a d - wave contribution .",
    "the best fit corresponds to an admixture of 0.72% for both d3 and d1 states in the @xmath1 wavefunction .",
    "compared to the results obtained by using the physical data alone , the significant change occurs for the percentage of the d1 component , that drops from 4.36% to 0.72% . as for the state",
    "d3 the differences are minor . in ref .",
    "@xcite the percentage was 0.88% .",
    "as @xmath75 , we conclude that the quenched lattice data is consistent with an equal admixture for both d - states .",
    "the initial number of effective parameters needed for a good fit can be reduced from five to four .    in fig .",
    "[ figgmfit ] the quenched @xmath4 data is very well described by our model [ which is also stated in the table [ tabchi2 ] in the column @xmath76 .",

    "the model describes fairly well the lattice data for the quadrupole form factors .",
    "the quality decreases for the lightest pion mass , which is due to the omission of explicit pion cloud effects in our approach .",
    "it is encouraging that the @xmath68 values are lower than the ones found for the fit in the physical region @xcite , indicating that the procedure used here is more natural .",
    "still , it should be said that the @xmath68 s obtained also possibly reflect the still poorer quadrupole lattice statistics and the narrower range of the lattice data , when compared to the experimental data or even to the lattice data for @xmath4 .",
    "a study of the dependence of the @xmath2 form factors on the pion mass and @xmath10 was also considered in refs .",

    "@xcite , manifests a significant difference from the more recent analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite . for similar pion mass the results of the ref .",

    "after the parametrization of the d - states was obtained from the lattice data , we can now apply it to the physical region .",
    "this requires that we use the experimental data , in the form of the two ratios r_em = - , r_em = - , where @xmath78 is the photon momentum in the @xmath1 rest frame , and we use the empirical parametrization of ref .",

    "note that the sato and lee parametrization gives a contribution similar to our model for @xmath81 gev@xmath82 , for both @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "it lies above our results , overpredicting the lattice data , for lower @xmath10 .    in conclusion , by fixing the d - state components by the lattice data and considering a pion cloud parametrization , derived from the large-@xmath13 limit at the physical point",
    ", we obtained a fairly good description of the quadrupole lattice data , in the range @xmath83 gev@xmath82 .",
    "the exception is the region @xmath84 gev@xmath82 where a small d1-mixture , when compared with ref .",
    "@xcite , underpredicts the @xmath6 data .",
    "note however that there is some discrepancy between different experimental data in that region @xcite . the planned data from the clas collaboration for that range would be important to clarify the low @xmath10 behavior of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "a complete lattice qcd dataset is available in ref .",
    "it presents lattice data in the quenched approximation , and the unquenched data based on wilson and also on a hybrid action . in this work",
    "we restrict our application to the quenched data .",
    "there are three main reasons for this restriction :    * there is a significant discrepancy between the quenched and unquenched data , particularly for the results of @xmath4 with heavier masses . in this regime",
    "we would expect small pion cloud effects , implying negligible differences between quenched and unquenched results . in fig .",
    "[ figgm600 ] we compare the lattice data corresponding to @xmath85 mev ( quenched ) and @xmath86 mev ( hybrid action ) .",
    "there is a significant difference between those two data sets , with the wilson data associated with @xmath87 691 mev being more consistent with the hybrid action ( @xmath85 mev ) .",
    "* there are differences between the two unquenched results , in particular for the value of @xmath88 .",
    "the extension of our model depends on the ( quenched ) @xmath89 mass .",
    "it is not clear whether the extension of our model is justified for the unquenched calculations , where the nucleon , @xmath1 , and @xmath89 masses would differ from the quenched masses .",
    "we would expect only minor differences for heavier pion masses ( say @xmath90 mev ) .",
    "however , the significant difference between the @xmath89 mass for the wilson action data with @xmath91 mev ( @xmath92 mev ) and the hybrid action with @xmath93 mev ( @xmath94 mev ) is difficult to explain . *",
    "finally , there is only a limited number of unquenched quadrupole data points for large pion masses .",
    "since the unquenched lattice data for light pion masses as 353 mev ( hybrid action ) and 384 mev ( wilson action ) are expected to be contaminated with pion cloud effects , which can not be simulated by our valence quark model , those points would have to be excluded .",
    "we would then be left with 6 or 8 - 9 quadrupole points , respectively , for the wilson and hybrid action ( to be compared with 21 from quenched data ) , and with such a small number of constraints the fit would naturally become meaningless .    apart from the disagreement observed in the description of the magnetic dipole form factor , the wilson and hybrid action lattice data suggest a weaker falloff of the electric quadrupole form factor @xmath5 when compared to the quenched prediction .",
    "this result is also observed for the physical point extrapolation .    once the differences between the two unquenched results are understood , and the disagreement between quenched and unquenched results for @xmath95 mev is clarified , it would be interesting to use also unquenched data to extract the contribution of the d - states , using the procedure suggested here . the increasing of statistics in both quenched and unquenched lattice data could also help to constrain the effects of the @xmath1 d - states in the @xmath2 transition .",
    "in this work we study the valence quark contributions to the @xmath2 transition in the lattice qcd regime , in the framework of the covariant spectator formalism .",
    "the nucleon and the @xmath1 wavefunctions are not derived from a wave equation but are parametrized in terms of the nucleon and @xmath1 symmetry structure for spin , isospin and angular momentum . by construction ,",
    "the formalism includes only valence quark degrees of freedom , whereas meson cloud mechanisms are not taken into account .    as discussed extensively in the literature ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , valence contributions do not dominate the quadrupole form factors at the physical point , where the pion cloud effects dominate instead , while the opposite happens in the lattice qcd regime . in an attempt to explain the significant difference between the experimental data and the emerging simulations of lattice qcd with decreasing pion mass , but still small chiral effects associated with the light pions , we started by comparing our quark model directly to the lattice data .",
    "in contrast to the dominant contribution controlled by the nucleon and @xmath1 s - states , the @xmath1 d - states , being a second order correction , are more sensitive to the lattice data .",
    "this sensitivity provides a clean evaluation of the valence quark contribution , since in the physical region the valence quark contribution is masked by the overwhelmingly larger contribution of the pion cloud , and consequently the d - state parametrization can not be accurately constrained .",
    "accordingly , we found that by fixing the d - states by the physical data first does not lead to a good description of the lattice qcd data .",
    "we also verified that , inversely , when the d - states are first fixed in the lattice qcd regime , then a good description of the physical data is possible .",
    "in fact , adding the valence quark contribution extrapolated from quenched lattice qcd to the physical mass regime , with an estimate of the pion cloud based on the large-@xmath13 limit @xcite , the experimental data for @xmath2 quadrupole form factor is well described .",
    "an even more accurate description of the experimental data can in principle be obtained by considering more and more precise lattice qcd data , and a more sophisticated estimate of the pion cloud .",
    "we conclude that lattice qcd data are important to constrain valence quark models .",
    "since for lattice calculations with @xmath8 mev valence quark effects dominate over the pion cloud , lattice data can be used to study and separate those effects .",

    "<S> starting with a covariant spectator quark model developed for the nucleon ( @xmath0 ) and the @xmath1 in the physical pion mass region , we extend the predictions of the reaction @xmath2 to the lattice qcd regime . </S>",
    "<S> the quark model includes s and d waves in the quark - diquark wavefunctions . within this framework </S>",
    "<S> it is the d - wave part in the @xmath1 wavefunction that generates nonzero valence contributions for the quadrupole form factors of the transition . </S>",
    "<S> those contributions are however insufficient to explain the physical data , since the pion cloud contributions dominate . </S>",
    "<S> to separate the two effects we apply the model to the lattice regime in a region where the pion cloud effects are negligible , and adjust the d - state parameters directly to the lattice data . </S>",
    "<S> this process allows us to obtain a better determination of the d - state contributions . finally , by adding a simple parametrization of the pion cloud we establish the connection between the experimental data and the lattice data . </S>"
