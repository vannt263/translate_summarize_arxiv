    "<S> we report an exact solution for the noise spectrum of spin - current without charge - current in a spin field effect transistor ( sfet ) . for the sfet with two leads </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that both auto- and cross - correlation functions are needed to characterize the noise of spin - current . </S>",
    "<S> a shot noise is also generated for the charge - current even though the net charge - current is identically zero . </S>",
    "<S> the noise spectra of spin - current and charge - current depends on the coupling strength between the sfet and the leads , and they may behave qualitatively differently . </S>",
    "<S> we also present results of noise spectra in the adiabatic regime .    due to the particle nature of carriers , the fluctuation of charge - current </S>",
    "<S> gives rise to the notion of shot noise@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for a normal system , the current correlation between different probes ( cross correlation ) is negative for fermions and positive for bosons@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation can be more complicated if superconducting leads are present@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the correlation properties provide further information , in addition to those contained in conductance or charge - current , for mesoscopic conductors@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so far all theoretical and experimental attention have been devoted to correlations of charge - current .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we theoretically investigate the correlation of _ spin - current _ in the absence of charge - current in a two - probe device . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , to be able to generate and control spin - current is of great importance for spintronics@xcite , but the noise spectra of spin - current has never been studied before . </S>",
    "<S> a pure spin - current can behave qualitatively differently from charge - current because spins can flip so that spin - current may not be conserved . therefore the cross correlation of currents may not be directly related to the auto - correlation . on the other hand , the conservation of charge forces the cross correlation and auto - correlation of charge - current noise spectra to differ by just a minus sign in a two - probe system . </S>",
    "<S> this difference necessarily indicates that the noise spectra of spin - current is more complicated . to be more specific </S>",
    "<S> , we will investigate the spin - current correlation in a two - probe quantum spin field effect transistor ( sfet)@xcite . the detailed working principle of the sfet is summarized elsewhere@xcite and we refer interested readers there : this device delivers an instantaneous spin - current but without generating a net charge - current by the help of a rotating magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> roughly , if all the spin - up electrons in a conductor move to one direction while an equal number of spin - down electrons move to the opposite direction , the net charge - current vanishes because @xmath0 ; and a finite spin - current results because @xmath1 . here @xmath2 are the electron current for spin - up and spin - down electrons respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the sfet provides a mechanism for this effect , and there are a number of other possibilities to produce @xmath3 with @xmath4 which is the subject of several recently studies both theoretically@xcite and experimentally@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> for a two - lead device , correlations can be formed by quantities measured at the same lead  the auto - correlation , or by quantities measured at the two different leads  the cross - correlation . as discussed above , due to a lack of spin - current conservation , we need both auto- and cross - correlation to characterize the noise spectra of spin - current . </S>",
    "<S> it has been well known@xcite that anti - bunching in a fermionic system gives rise to negative definite cross - correlation for charge - current , and much of the recent research has been devoted to situations where the sign of this correlation@xcite can be reversed . for spin - current , </S>",
    "<S> the situation is very different . </S>",
    "<S> we found that when the coupling between sfet and lead is strong , the cross - correlation function of spin - current is positive definite . in the intermediate or weak coupling regime , </S>",
    "<S> the cross - correlation of spin - current is positive when the system is far off a quantum resonance but it becomes negative near the resonance . in the adiabatic regime , the shot noise of a sfet involving only a single lead vanishes at resonance which corresponds to the quantization of delivered spin . as the coupling strength between the single lead and the sfet </S>",
    "<S> is varied , the shot noise is found to displays different number of peaks depending on the coupling strength . </S>",
    "<S> many of these features persist in the non - adiabatic regime . </S>",
    "<S> finally , an oscillation between positive and negative shot noise is observed as a sfet parameter is tuned . </S>",
    "<S> these findings are qualitatively different and much richer than the behavior of charge - current correlations .    </S>",
    "<S> we start by considering the sfet which generates spin - current without charge - current , described by the following hamiltonian@xcite @xmath5 d_{\\sigma } ^{\\dagger } d_{\\sigma } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\gamma [ \\exp(-i\\omega t ) d^\\dagger_{\\uparrow } d_{\\downarrow } + h.c . ] </S>",

    "<S> ]   \\label{hhh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first term stands for the non - interacting electrons in lead @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the creation operator . </S>",
    "<S> note that we have set the same chemical potential for the leads @xmath8 and @xmath9 because we are only interested in the quantum pumping effect@xcite of the sfet . </S>",
    "<S> the second term describes the scattering region of the sfet which is a quantum dot characterized by an energy level @xmath10 and spin @xmath11 . a gate voltage @xmath12 is applied to control the energy level . </S>",
    "<S> the sfet generates spin - current@xcite via a time - dependent magnetic field @xmath13 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the last term of the hamiltonian denotes tunneling between the leads and the dot with tunneling matrix elements @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , we apply a rotating magnetic field ( the term proportional to @xmath15 ) rather than an oscillating field : a counter - clockwise rotating field allows a spin - down electron to absorb a photon and flip to spin - up , and it does not allow a spin - up electron to emit a photon and flip to spin - down . </S>",
    "<S> as schematically shown in the upper inset of fig.(2 ) , it is this symmetry breaking field that provides the driving force to deliver a pure dc spin - current to the leads@xcite .    to analyze the noise spectrum of spin - current </S>",
    "<S> , we define a spin - dependent particle current operator ( @xmath16 ) @xmath17}{dt }   = -i\\sum_{k}[t_{k\\alpha } c_{k\\alpha \\sigma } ^{\\dagger}d_{\\sigma } -h.c . ] . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{j1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then the charge - current operator is @xmath18 an important quantity for our study is the correlation between spin - dependent particle currents in lead @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21   [ \\hat{j}_{\\beta \\sigma^{\\prime } } ( t_{2})-\\bar{j}_{\\beta \\sigma^{\\prime } } ] > \\label{s1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath22 and @xmath23 denoting spin indices . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath24 denotes both statistical average and quantum average on the nonequilibrium state . </S>",
    "<S> the noise spectra of both charge - current and spin - current can be obtained from the correlation @xmath25 .    </S>",
    "<S> we calculate @xmath25 using standard keldysh nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) formalism@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> briefly , we substitute eq.([j1 ] ) into eq.([s1 ] ) , define negf @xmath26 and @xmath27 with properly contour ordered operators , and apply the theorem of analytic continuation@xcite so that the contour green s functions are extended to the real time axis . </S>",
    "<S> this standard and widely used negf technique allows us to obtain the exact expression for the zero - frequency spin - dependent correlation@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we now examine noise spectrum in the low temperature limit @xmath28 , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ the shot noise . </S>",
    "<S> first , setting @xmath29l , @xmath30r in @xmath25 , we investigate shot noise of the charge - current ( cross correlation ) . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shwon in ref . that the net charge - current of the sfet is identically zero@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , however here we find that shot noise of it is nonzero . </S>",

    "<S> the excess noise has the following lineshape in the adiabatic limit ( _ i.e. _ @xmath37 ) , @xmath38 here @xmath39 is the resonant level of the quantum dot and we have set @xmath40 and @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the excess noise ( cross correlation ) in charge - current is always negative . </S>",
    "<S> a single peak is found at @xmath42 for @xmath43 while a double peak structure occurs when @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood as follows . when the spin flip magnetic field @xmath15 is turned on , </S>",
    "<S> the spin degeneracy of resonant state is broken . </S>",
    "<S> two resonant states are found at @xmath45 with level spacing @xmath46 and half width @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath44 , the two resonant states do not overlap and we obtain two peaks . however , if @xmath43 , only one peak is showed up due to the overlapping of resonant states . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the auto - correlation is obtained by setting @xmath48l in @xmath25 , and it is straightforward to show @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the expected result for charge - current which is a conserved quantity , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ @xmath50 .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we calculate the shot noise for spin - current . </S>",
    "<S> the cross correlation spin - current shot noise is found to be : @xmath51 \\label{ss1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the auto - correlation is found to be : @xmath52-\\gamma _ { l}\\gamma _ { r } ( |g_{\\uparrow \\downarrow } ^{r}|^2+|g_{\\downarrow \\uparrow } ^{r}|^2)\\right\\ } \\label{ss2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in contrast to the shot noise of charge - current , we need both the cross- and the auto - correlation to characterize the shot noise for spin - current for the two - lead sfet . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is because a spin - current is not conserved due to the spin flip mechanism introduced by the rotating magnetic field . in the adiabatic limit </S>",
    "<S> , the cross correlation reduces to @xmath53 ^ 2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times ( \\epsilon^2+\\gamma^2/4-\\gamma^2-\\gamma \\gamma ) \\label{ss1a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , cross correlation @xmath54 can be either positive or negative depending on a number of parameters : the gate voltage which controls the energy level position , the linewidth function @xmath55 , and the external magnetic field strength @xmath15 ( see fig.1 ) . far away from resonance , </S>",
    "<S> the cross correlation is always positive when @xmath56 ( with @xmath57 ) regardless of the coupling strength between quantum dot and the leads . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , for @xmath58 , the cross correlation is positive definite when the coupling of the lead to the quantum dot is strong such that @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> when the coupling to the lead is in the intermediate range @xmath60 , the cross correlation turns to negative . in the weakly coupled regime @xmath61 , </S>",
    "<S> the cross correlation becomes positive again . </S>",
    "<S> the cross correlation is zero when @xmath62 or @xmath63 with @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , as one varys the ratio @xmath65 , different lineshapes are found for the cross correlation : ( 1 ) in the strong coupling regime ( compared with 2@xmath15 ) : @xmath66 , the cross correlation is positive definite with a broad peak at @xmath42 ( see inset of fig.1 ) ; ( 2 ) as one decreases the coupling strength @xmath55 such that @xmath67 , the positive peak at @xmath42 becomes a local minimum and a double peak structure appears . </S>",
    "<S> this can also be seen in the shot noise for the charge - current ( auto correlation)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> due to the overlap of the two resonant states , two peaks are found ( solid line in fig.1 ) ; ( 3 ) as one further decreases @xmath55 , a third peak emerges at @xmath42 when @xmath68 ( so that two resonant states do not overlap ) ( see dotted line in fig.1 ) ; ( 4 ) finally , in the weak coupling regime ( @xmath69 ) , the third peak splits and a four - peak structure appears in the shot noise ( dashed line in fig.1 ) . because of the spin flip mechanism , both spin - up and spin - down electrons are contributing to the spin current . </S>",
    "<S> the cross correlation between spin up electrons ( or spin down ) is negative definite while the cross correlation between spin - up electron and spin - down electron is positive definite . </S>",
    "<S> the competition between these two contributions gives rise to either a positive or a negative cross correlation . </S>",
    "<S> such a complicated behavior is qualitatively different from the correlation in charge - current .    </S>",
    "<S> in the adiabatic regime , the auto - correlation is obtained from eq.([ss2 ] ) , @xmath70 }   { 4\\pi[(\\epsilon^2+\\gamma^2/4-\\gamma^2)^2+\\gamma^2 \\gamma^2]^2 }   \\label{s3}\\ ] ] which is positive definite . </S>",
    "<S> when the cross correlation is zero , the auto correlation is @xmath71 .    </S>",
    "<S> the sfet can operate with a single lead@xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the shot noise is found to be @xmath72 ^ 2 }   \\label{s4}\\ ] ] we observe that this shot noise is positive definite and it displays a single to four - peak structure in the lineshape as @xmath55 is changed . </S>",
    "<S> this is similar to the behavior of @xmath54 . when @xmath73 , the shot noise is zero at @xmath74 . for a single lead sfet , </S>",
    "<S> the spin current was found before@xcite , @xmath75 when the shot noise is identically zero , @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the sfet pumps out two spin quanta ( @xmath16 ) in a period @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> this gives an example of `` optimal '' spin pump . </S>",
    "<S> the analogous optimal charge pump@xcite was discussed in literature which is actually rather difficult to achieve@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our exact solutions eqs.([ss1 ] ) and ( [ ss2 ] ) also allow the investigation of shot noise of spin - current in the non - adiabatic regime ( @xmath78 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we fix field strength @xmath79 in the following calculation . when frequency @xmath78 , the noise becomes asymmetric with respect to the gate voltage . for @xmath80 , the influence of frequency </S>",
    "<S> is shown in the left inset of fig.2 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that when @xmath81 ( solid line ) , the depths of the two minima decrease . </S>",
    "<S> as frequency changes to @xmath82 ( dotted line ) , the noise is still negative for a wide range of gate voltages and is positive for some negative gate voltages . finally , when @xmath83 , the noise becomes positive definite . </S>",
    "<S> the noise as a function of frequency is depicted in fig.2 . the oscillatory behavior between positive and negative noise of the spin - current </S>",
    "<S> is observed , which is due to photon assisted process .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have , for the first time , presented an exact solution of the shot noise for spin - current generated by the sfet which is essentially a quantum spin pump at arbitrary pumping frequency . </S>",
    "<S> for the device discussed here , the instantaneous charge current is zero but its shot noise is finite . due to the spin flip mechanism in the sfet , </S>",
    "<S> the spin - current is not conserved . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , both auto - correlation and cross correlation must be used to characterize the shot noise of spin - current for our two - lead system . away from a quantum resonance </S>",
    "<S> , we found that the cross correlation becomes positive due to the occurance of carriers with different spin . in the adiabatic regime , the auto - correlation of a quantum dot connected to a single lead is calculated and found to be zero when the pumped spin is quantized . </S>",
    "<S> as the coupling strength between the single lead and the quantum dot is varied , we found that the shot noise displays different lineshapes in the different coupling regimes . </S>"
