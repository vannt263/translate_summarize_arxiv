    "since hawking @xcite first proposed that a black hole emits thermal radiation with an emission rate inversely proportional to its mass , there have been several calculations of the emergent spectrum in order to verify or at very least constrain the presence of the smallest , hence most luminous ones .",
    "nominally , aside from particle spin effects and gravitational backscattering effects close to the black hole , calculated by page @xcite , one would expect the the emergent spectrum to be thermal , since hawking showed that the black hole can be thought of as a black body with a temperature @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the mass of the black hole , @xmath2 is newton s gravitational constant , and we set the boltzmann constant , @xmath3 ( along with @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) .    however , when a detailed model of the physics of the emitted particles in considered , the emergent spectrum becomes more complicated .",
    "for example , macgibbon and weber @xcite and halzen et al .",
    "@xcite have considered black holes with temperatures greater than the characteristic qcd energy scale @xmath6mev , where the black hole begins to emit quarks and gluons .",
    "they propose that the emitted quarks and gluons fragment into hadrons , which further decay into photons , electrons , neutrinos etc . , and they convolve a jet code with the hawking thermal spectrum to determine the emergent spectrum . for black hole temperatures above @xmath7 ,",
    "the qcd degrees of freedom dominate in the standard model and the ultimate products of quark and gluon fragmentation will dominate the spectrum , thus understanding the physics of the quarks and gluons is important for determining the spectrum .    in this letter , we reconsider an important initial assumption made by macgibbon and weber , namely that the quarks and gluons emitted from the black hole directly fragment into hadrons .",
    "rather , since the density of emitted particles around the black hole can be very high ( much higher than nuclear density ) for @xmath8 , we propose that the quarks and gluons propagate through this dense plasma and lose energy via qcd bremsstrahlung and pair production interactions until the density of the outward - propagating plasma becomes low enough that the quarks finally fragment into hadrons .",
    "one can then calculate an emergent spectrum by convolving this collection of lower energy quarks with jet codes or fragmentation functions , but this spectrum will be very different than the one obtained using fragmentation of quarks coming directly from the black hole .",
    "in addition to determining the emergent spectrum of the black hole including the effect of interactions , we will also consider several observational consequences of the this emergent spectrum , using the egret and glast satellites as exemplary detectors .",
    "since it is reasonable to assume that fundamental modes will be present in a thermal bath , let us assume that once above a temperature @xmath8 , a black hole emits individual quarks and gluons .",
    "hawking showed that the emission rate spectrum for each particle degree of freedom is @xmath9 , for particles of energy @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the absorption coefficient which in general depends upon the spin of the particle @xmath12 , @xmath1 , and @xmath10 @xcite , and we have assumed the black hole to be uncharged and non - rotating . in the relativistic limit @xmath13 the total rate at which particles are _ directly _ emitted from the black hole can be expressed in the form @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is of order of the number of emitted relativistic particles at temperature @xmath16 and can be calculated numerically @xcite .",
    "since this is the flux of particles crossing the schwartzschild radius @xmath17 , the density @xmath18 of emitted particles at a radius @xmath19 from the black hole is then @xmath20 . expressing this in a more illuminating form ,",
    "we obtain @xmath21 for the qcd , @xmath22 , thus the average particle separation , defined as @xmath23 is then @xmath24 .",
    "qcd is an asymptotically free theory of interactions between quarks and gluons . in general , when particles scatter , the momentum exchanged must be at least of order their inverse separation @xmath25 . as a consequence , at distances smaller than @xmath26",
    "the qcd interaction is perturbative , while at larger distances , the coupling becomes so large that vacuum polarization and fragmentation is dominant .",
    "in particular , vacuum fragmentation of quarks and gluons will occur when they are separated by a distance greater than @xmath26 .",
    "we see from the above formulas that once @xmath8 , the quarks and gluons around the black hole will not immediately vacuum fragment into hadrons because they are closely spaced in a kind of plasma . rather , they will propagate for some distance in the dense quark - gluon plasma until the plasma becomes tenuous enough that vacuum fragmentation will occur .",
    "this is important because as the quarks and gluons propagate away from the black hole in the dense plasma , they will interact with each other via bremsstrahlung and pair production and decrease in energy .",
    "this can be seen by following the arguments of heckler @xcite , who has shown that qed and qcd bremsstrahlung and pair production interactions become important among particles emitted from a black hole above some critical temperature .",
    "the essential argument stems from the fact that the relativistic bremsstrahlung cross section is independent of energy , and since the density of particles around the black hole increases with temperature ( eq .  [ density ] ) , there is a critical temperature for which the optical depth of an emitted particle becomes unity . at this point particles",
    "begin to scatter copiously , and a kind of photosphere forms around the black hole .",
    "the photosphere is a kind of fireball in the sense that the nearly thermalized plasma propagates outward , decreasing in temperature until i ) the electrons and positrons annihilate in the qed case or ii ) the quarks and gluons fragment or some kind of qcd phase transition occurs in the qcd case .    to simplify matters",
    ", we will assume that the plasma cools to the temperature @xmath7 , at which point hadronization occurs .",
    "the emergent photon spectrum is a convolution of the quark and gluon spectrum with the pion fragmentation function @xcite and the lorentz - transformed neutral pion decay into photons @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the number of photons of energy @xmath10 created by an pion decaying isotropically in its rest frame , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the velocity of the pion ( note @xmath31 is doppler shifted , @xmath32 ) .",
    "the pion spectrum is @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the flux spectrum of the quark or gluon @xmath35 of energy @xmath36 at the time of fragmentation , which is on the outer edge of the photosphere where the plasma is at a temperature of @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the relative number of pions with energy @xmath39 produced by @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "we will use @xmath40 , where @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "we approximate the quark and gluon spectrum in the observer frame by boosting a thermal spectrum at temperature @xmath42 with the lorentz gamma factor @xmath43 of the outer edge of the outward moving photosphere @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the number of internal degrees of freedom of particle @xmath35 , the sign in the denominator is for fermions or bosons , and we have we integrated over the surface of the photosphere with radius @xmath46 . using ref .",
    "@xcite , we approximate @xmath47 and @xmath48",
    ". an accurate calculation of the spectrum would require using a boltzmann equation to determine the exact spectrum of the nearly thermal quarks and gluons , and a jet fragmentation code for the final decay into pions and photons . we expect the approximations used will be correct within a factor of order unity .    in figure  1 we show the photon spectrum calculated using the above formulas both including and excluding the qcd photosphere . without the photosphere , the quark and gluon spectrum is simply a blackbody spectrum ( with spin and finite size effects ) at the temperature @xmath16 .",
    "we see that the main difference between these two spectra is that the photosphere spectrum has many more lower energy photons .",
    "this is physically due to the fact that the photosphere processes high energy quarks and gluon into many lower energy ones , and these eventually fragment and decay into lower energy photons .",
    "we also plot the spectrum of photons emitted directly from the black hole which peak at approximately @xmath49 .",
    "the peak height is several orders of magnitude lower than the peak from quarks and gluons , mostly due to the qcd degrees of freedom which can decay into photons is large @xcite .",
    "the total number of photons emitted from the qcd photosphere , which peaks at energies of about 100mev , is @xmath50 which scales as @xmath51 , which is a stronger function of black hole temperature than the @xmath16 dependence of black body particle emission , or the @xmath52 dependence obtained in the fragmentation model of macgibbon and weber .",
    "note that once the black hole is above the qed critical temperature of about 45gev , the direct photons will also be processed through a qed photosphere and be degraded to low energies @xcite .",
    "we have included the qed photosphere spectrum in figure  1 , which peaks between 1 and 10 mev and produces @xmath53 .",
    "the extra power of @xmath54 in the qcd case comes from the multiplicity of fragmentation of quarks into pions .",
    "let us examine several observational consequences of the qcd photosphere .",
    "the most important consequence involves the search for individual nearby primordial black holes . when developing a strategy and interpreting the results of a direct search for expiring black holes , one must consider the density , emergent spectrum and lifetime of the black holes , all of which are a function of black hole mass , and the detector sensitivity and background , which are a both a function of photon energy .",
    "first , one can determine the optimum energy range to search for these black holes by considering the background : since the observed gamma ray background scales approximately as @xmath55 in the range 1mev to 10gev , one can show using the example of the spectrum of figure  1 that for black holes with @xmath56 10tev ( higher @xmath16 black holes have lifetimes shorter than 1s , and emit negligible amounts of radiation ) , the optimum signal to background lies in the range of 1 to 10gev .",
    "next , one can determine the optimum black hole mass to which the detector is sensitive . naturally , if @xmath57 is the photon emission rate of the black hole , and @xmath58 is the limiting flux to which the detector is sensitive , then @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the distance to the black hole .",
    "we know that , @xmath61 , however , the lifetime of the black hole @xmath62 .",
    "one must , therefore , also require that the total lifetime integrated number of photons incident on the detector is ( at _ least _ ) greater than unity . to be more realistic ,",
    "let us require the observed amount of photons @xmath63 .",
    "thus , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the area of the detector .",
    "when both conditions are met , one finds @xmath66 .",
    "the optimal observing conditions thus occur for black holes which just meet this criterion . by using eq .",
    "[ ndot ] and noting that @xmath67 ( see e.g. @xcite ) , we can roughly estimate the maximum observing distance @xmath68 .",
    "let us consider two satellites : egret @xcite , which has already accumulated several years of data , and glast @xcite , which is still in its planning stages . in figure",
    "2 we show the maximum distance each satellite can observe a small black hole , and determine that for egret ( glast ) , @xmath69 .",
    "once one has found a limit on the maximum distance one can observe these black holes , one can refashion this limit into other useful limits .",
    "macgibbon and carr @xcite , and halzen et al .",
    "@xcite use the page - hawking limit @xcite , which is discussed below , to find a generic limit on the local density of black holes below a mass @xmath1 to be @xmath70 , where @xmath71 g is the mass of a black hole which has a life of the age of the universe , @xmath72 is page - hawking limit on the average density of @xmath73 black holes , and @xmath74 is the local density enhancement of black holes compared to the universal average .",
    "this general scaling solution is valid up to masses @xmath75 and is related to the fact that the black hole lifetime is proportional to @xmath76 .",
    "we can make a similar limit on the value of @xmath77 by assuming that if egret and glast find no black holes after a time @xmath78 , then this will optimally constrain the density black holes with masses @xmath79 whose lifetime is @xmath80 .",
    "however , there is a subtle beneficial effect : after observing for a time @xmath81 , larger mass black holes , which have higher number densities , will have decayed to mass @xmath79 . since @xmath82",
    "( see e.g. @xcite ) , one can begin to constrain black holes with mass @xmath83 , where @xmath84 .",
    "if the constraint on the density of @xmath79 black holes is @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the solid angle covered by the detector , then we obtain the limit @xmath87 as long as @xmath88 .",
    "simply put , observing for a longer time allows one to observe larger , more densely populated black holes which decay to the optimum observing mass @xmath79 , and this allows for better limits on @xmath77 . with four years of observation and assuming no black holes",
    "are found with egret or glast , one can place the limits @xmath89 notice that this limit scales as @xmath90 . as pointed out by halzen et al .",
    "@xcite , luminous matter clusters locally by a factor on the order of @xmath91 , thus since @xmath92 , egret may be able to see nearby primordial black holes .",
    "one can also place a limit on the local rate @xmath93 at which black holes expire per unit volume .",
    "roughly , @xmath94 . for egret ( glast ) one finds @xmath95 .",
    "comparison of these results to previous results is difficult because non - standard particle models were often used .",
    "for example , there have been several limits placed on @xmath93 based on the hagedorn model @xcite , which presumes that the number of degrees of freedom increase exponentially with temperature , a fact that has no experimental support for energies up to about 1tev .",
    "it is important to note , however , that alexandreas et al .",
    "@xcite use the standard model of macgibbon and webber , and conclude from data of a tev air shower array that @xmath96 .",
    "however , as illustrated in figure  3 , the photosphere dramatically alters the lifetime integrated spectrum , and the expected flux of photons above 1tev is about four orders of magnitude lower than the macgibbon and webber result , which translates into a limit on @xmath93 six orders of magnitude weaker ( higher ) .",
    "note especially that when the photosphere is included , the lifetime integrated spectrum decreases as @xmath97 instead of @xmath98 .",
    "in fact the total number of photons above energy @xmath99 produced by a black hole of initial temperature @xmath16 is @xmath100 , which is valid for energies @xmath101gev .",
    "this is to be compared to the result of halzen et al , which finds @xmath102 .",
    "this lower flux at high energies renders any search for primordial black holes with tev air shower arrays impractical .",
    "it is interesting to note that wright @xcite points out that the anisotropic component of the gamma ray background may be explained by the presence of primordial black holes clustered in the halo of our galaxy .",
    "if black holes are responsible for the anisotropy , then he finds @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the hubble parameter , and this is only about an order of magnitude lower than the estimated detection limits of the glast project .",
    "another consequence involves the page - hawking limit , which constrains ( or possibly measures ) the density of primordial black holes by comparing their expected contribution to the gamma ray background , for a given black hole density , to the actual observed background .",
    "macgibbon and carr @xcite , and halzen et al .",
    "@xcite , have studied this approach in detail , using a model of direct fragmentation of quarks and gluons ( i.e. no",
    "photosphere ) , and they conclude that black holes with mass less than about @xmath105 g can not contribute more than a fraction @xmath106 of the critical density of the universe .    we have performed the same calculation including the effects of the qcd photosphere ( see figure  3 ) and verified , as suggested by heckler @xcite , that the qcd photosphere does not significantly change ( i.e. less than a few percent ) the limit on @xmath107 found by halzen et al . @xcite .",
    "the effect is small because the qcd photosphere becomes important only at temperatures above @xmath7 , and black holes with these temperatures do not significantly contribute to the total number of photons at 100mev .",
    "there is one important difference in the spectrum : above energies of about 300mev the spectrum including the photosphere is proportional to @xmath97 , whereas the results of halzen et al .",
    "show a @xmath98 dependence .",
    "the steeper slope is due to the degrading of high energy quarks into lower energies as they are processed through the photosphere .    as a final note , since",
    "the qcd photosphere will emit charged pions as well as neutral ones , there will also be a flux of neutrinos , electrons , and positrons up to several orders of magnitude larger than previously assumed , with spectra very similar to the photon spectrum in figure  1 .",
    "this will make constraints on ( or possibilities of detection of ) high energy neutrinos @xcite , and positrons @xcite from black holes much more important ."
