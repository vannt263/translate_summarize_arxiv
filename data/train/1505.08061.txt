    "are a good cdm candidate ; they arise in extensions of the standard model of particle physics , such as supersymmetry , and are naturally produced in the early universe with the correct abundance ( for reviews see e.g. , refs .",
    "wimps from the dark matter halo of the milky way can be detected directly on earth , via the kev - scale recoils produced when they elastically scatter off nuclei  @xcite .",
    "current direct detection experiments , including cdms  @xcite , lux  @xcite and xenon100  @xcite , are sensitive to spin - independent wimp - nucleon cross - sections of order @xmath1 .",
    "significant increases in sensitivity are expected in the next few years as detector target masses are increased to the ton - scale and beyond  ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "as anticipated in early work on direct detection  @xcite , these large detectors will also be able to detect coherent neutrino - nucleus scattering of astrophysical neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "neutrinos are therefore the ultimate background for wimp direct detection searches as they can not be shielded against and produce recoils with similar rates and energy spectra  @xcite .    for near - future direct detection experiments the most problematic types of neutrino are those produced in @xmath2b decay in the sun and in cosmic ray collisions in the earth s atmosphere . in a xenon detector",
    "the recoil energy spectrum and rate from @xmath3 neutrinos very closely matches that of a wimp with mass @xmath4 and cross - section @xmath5 , while the spectrum from atmospheric neutrinos is similar to that of a wimp with @xmath6 and @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "consequently the sensitivity of an experiment to wimps reaches a point of saturation where it becomes difficult to tell the difference between wimp and neutrino induced recoils using their energies alone .",
    "so as the exposure or mass of an experiment increases the minimum discoverable cross - section rather than decreasing reaches a plateau . the value of cross - section at which this occurs depends on the systematic uncertainty in the neutrino flux and is commonly referred to as the `` neutrino floor ''  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting however that for very large exposures , the neutrino floor is eventually mitigated when the small differences in the tails of the recoil energy distributions of wimps and neutrinos start to distinguish the two .",
    "however these required exposures are prohibitively large and well beyond the next generation of experiments so for practical purposes the neutrino background does effectively present a `` floor '' to the discovery of dark matter and we will refer to it as such .",
    "if we wish to probe cross - sections below the neutrino floor then it is crucial to search for ways to distinguish the wimp and neutrino signals , for instance via their different time and direction dependences .",
    "grothaus  @xcite have explored the sensitivity of directional detectors capable of measuring the recoil directions in 3-dimensions using a hypothesis test which fits the wimp and neutrino event rates as a function of energy , time , and event angle with respect to the earth - sun direction .",
    "davis @xcite found that with very large exposures adding timing information allows the neutrino floor to be evaded at low wimp masses , due to the ( small ) annual modulation of both the wimp and solar neutrino signals .",
    "ruppin  @xcite examined how combining data from detectors composed of different target materials can probe cross - sections below the neutrino floor of a single experiment .",
    "they found that for spin - independent interactions the similarity in how the wimp and neutrino signals scaled with respect to different target nuclei limited the advantage gained from multiple experiments .",
    "however for spin - dependent interactions the complementarity of multiple targets greatly improves the potential discovery limits .",
    "directional detection experiments aim to reconstruct the nuclear recoil tracks in 3-dimensions .",
    "however this is experimentally challenging , and greater sensitivity might be achieved with a larger detector which measures the 1- or 2-dimensional projection of the recoil tracks . in this paper",
    "we extend the work of ref .",
    "@xcite by studying the effect of neutrino backgrounds on the sensitivity of ideal directional detectors with 1- , 2- and 3-dimensional readout .",
    "we compare the potential discovery limits of these detectors with those of non - directional experiments that only measure the energy of the recoils , or only count the number of events above some threshold energy .",
    "we also extend our study beyond the ideal detector case and consider the effects of finite angular resolution and limited sense recognition .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : neutrinofluxes ] we discuss the direction dependence of the cosmic neutrino fluxes .",
    "we then in section  [ sec : rates ] use these fluxes to calculate the directional neutrino event rates , and also review the calculation of the wimp directional event rate . in section",
    "[ sec : analysis ] we outline our analysis methodology for calculating discovery limits .",
    "we present our results in section  [ sec : res ] .",
    "finally we conclude in section  [ sec : conc ] with a summary and discussion of our results .",
    "in this section we review the solar , atmospheric and diffuse supernovae background neutrino ( dsnb ) fluxes that dark matter detectors will be sensitive to .",
    "we expand upon previous results in the literature by highlighting the angular dependence of these fluxes .",
    "neutrinos produced from several reactions in the solar interior have been well - measured ( for recent reviews see refs .",
    "most recently , the borexino experiment has made the first spectral measurement of the @xmath8 component of the solar neutrino flux  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical systematic uncertainties on different components of the solar neutrino flux range from 1% ( @xmath8 flux ) to 14% ( @xmath2b flux ) . for all measurements except the @xmath8 component , the theoretical uncertainties are as large as or larger than the measurement uncertainties .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty arises largely from the uncertainty in the solar metallicity , and in order to establish a self - consistent model of solar neutrino fluxes one must assume a metallicity model . for the solar neutrino flux we utilize the high metallicity standard solar model ( ssm ) as defined in ref .",
    "@xcite ; low metallicity ssms can predict lower flux normalizations by up to @xmath9% depending on the flux component . we consider here the high metallicity ssm because at present this model is more consistent with both the sno neutral current measurement and heliosiesmology data . in fact , future dark matter detection experiments will shed further light on the solar metallicity issue  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : flux ] shows the fluxes and normalizations of neutrinos produced from the different reactions . due to their rather low energy ( @xmath10 mev ) compared to the dsnb and atmospheric neutrinos , solar neutrinos will mostly impact the discovery potential of future direct detection experiments in the low - mass region , below 10  gev ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the overall fluxes of solar neutrinos , we are interested in their direction and time dependence . due to the eccentricity of the earth s orbit",
    ", the earth - sun distance has an annual variation inducing a modulation in the solar neutrino flux as seen by an earth - based experiment such that , @xmath11\\nonumber \\\\ & \\times \\delta\\left(\\hat{{\\bf q}}_\\nu-\\hat{{\\bf q}}_\\odot(t)\\right ) \\",

    "@xcite , both the solar neutrino and wimp event rates have a @xmath19% annual modulation but they peak at times that are separated by about 5 months , and consequently timing information could help discriminate wimps from neutrinos .      at higher nuclear recoil energies , greater than approximately 20 kev , the neutrino floor at high wimp masses , i.e. , above 100 gev , will mostly be induced by low - energy atmospheric neutrinos ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "these will limit the sensitivity of dark matter detectors without directional sensitivity to spin independent cross - sections greater than approximately @xmath20 @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "the low energy flux of atmospheric neutrinos , less than approximately 100 mev , is difficult to directly measure and theoretically predict  @xcite . at these energies ,",
    "the uncertainty on the predicted atmospheric neutrino flux is approximately 20%  @xcite . due to a cutoff in the rigidity of cosmic rays induced by the earth s geomagnetic field at low energies ,",
    "the atmospheric neutrino flux is larger for detectors that are nearer to the poles  @xcite .    over all energies , the atmospheric neutrino flux peaks near the horizon , at zenith angle @xmath22 . at high energies",
    ", the flux is very nearly symmetric about @xmath22 , as at these energies the cosmic ray particles are more energetic than the rigidity cutoff . at low energies ,",
    "the flux becomes asymmetric , as the flux of downward - going ( @xmath23 ) neutrinos is lower than the flux of upward - going neutrinos ( @xmath24 ) . for the analysis in this paper , we consider the fluka results for the angular dependence of the atmospheric neutrino rate  @xcite . as we discuss below",
    ", we find that when this flux is convolved with the angular dependence of the coherent neutrino - nucleus cross - section , the angular dependence is washed out and the recoil spectrum depends only weakly on direction .",
    "there is also a seasonal variation in the neutrino flux based on the atmospheric temperature which induces an additional time modulation .",
    "however the exact time dependence of this effect at the latitude of our mock experiment is not known and is likely too small to have a large effect on the observed limits .",
    "hence for this study we ignore both the angular and time dependence of the atmospheric neutrino flux and model it as isotropic and constant in time , @xmath25      for wimp masses between 10 and 30 gev , the neutrino floor is likely induced by the sub - dominant diffuse supernova neutrino background ( dsnb ) , from all supernova explosions in the history of the universe .",
    "the dsnb flux is a convolution of the core - collapse supernova rate as a function of redshift with the neutrino spectrum per supernova ; for a recent review of the predicted dsnb flux see beacom  @xcite .",
    "the dsnb spectra have a similar form to a fermi - dirac spectrum with temperatures in the range 3 - 8 mev .",
    "we use the following temperatures for each neutrino flavour : @xmath26 mev , @xmath27 mev and @xmath28 mev , where @xmath29 represents the four remaining neutrino flavours . motivated by theoretical estimates we take a systematic uncertainty on the dsnb flux of 50% .",
    "the dsnb is believed to be isotropic and constant over time , therefore its angular dependence can be expressed , as with the atmospheric neutrinos , using eq .",

    "however time information is more useful for discriminating solar neutrinos from light wimps than for discriminating atmospheric neutrinos from heavier wimps .",
    "this is because the wimp and solar neutrino rates are both annually modulated , and also the amplitude of the annual modulation is larger for light wimps . for energy information only ,",

    "again , for simplicity and to probe the full annual modulation signal , we assume that data is accumulated over one year .",
    "these detector masses and thresholds are chosen so that a non - directional detector with the same mass and threshold would be in the saturation regime that results in the neutrino floor , as seen in fig .",

    "@xcite which is the combination of two limits obtained by a xenon detector . for light wimps ( @xmath42 gev )",
    "the limit comes from a 3 ev threshold detector with an exposure of 0.19 ton years , while for heavier wimps ( @xmath43 gev ) a detector with a 4 kev threshold and an exposure of @xmath44 ton years was used .",
    "the two detector configurations roughly match our two detector setups a and b in table  [ tab : detectors ] . as described in refs .",
    "@xcite , the low - mass part of the neutrino floor comes from solar neutrinos ( which have low - energies but high fluxes ) with the shoulder at @xmath45  gev arising due to @xmath2b neutrinos .",
    "the high - mass part , above @xmath46 gev , is due to dsnb neutrinos and atmospheric neutrinos which have higher energies but much lower fluxes .    for the low threshold detector ,",
    "the directional discovery limits clearly cut through the low - mass neutrino floor and for the 3-d readout there is actually almost no reduction in sensitivity due to the neutrino background .",
    "the 1-d and 2-d readouts do suffer a small reduction in sensitivity , but evidently the distributions are different enough that it is still possible to probe cross - sections below the limit set by non - directional experiments . for the high threshold detector",
    "the improvement in the discovery limits , with respect to the high - mass neutrino floor , from directionality is smaller .",
    "however it does still help discriminate the isotropic atmospheric neutrino background from wimp induced recoils , in particular for wimp masses around @xmath47 where the energy spectra from wimps and atmospheric neutrinos are most similar .    in summary",
    ", we found that directionality is a powerful tool for disentangling neutrino backgrounds from a putative wimp signal .",
    "the gain from directionality is particularly impressive for low mass wimps thanks to the large separation between the solar neutrino and wimp incoming directions , see sec .",
    "[ sec : signals ] .",
    "interestingly , we found that this result still holds even if only the 2-d or 1-d projection of the recoil tracks can be measured .",
    "the gain from directionality in the high - mass region is more moderate , however , due to the large overlap between the wimp and the isotropic dsnb and atmospheric neutrino distributions . even in this case",
    ", we found that 1-d and 2-d readouts still outperform non - directional experiments .",
    "this highlights that it is worthwhile to construct directional detectors , even without full 3-d readout .",
    "similar conclusions were reached in ref .",

    "detector set - up a ( b ) , with low ( high ) mass and threshold.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]        as well as the 3-dimensional reconstruction of the recoil track , a key experimental concern is head - tail recognition i.e. , the ability to measure the sense ( @xmath48 or @xmath49 ) of the nuclear recoils . determining the sense of a recoil",
    "is expected to be possible in a gas tpc by measuring the asymmetry in the charge collected along the recoil track as well as asymmetry in the shape of the track itself  @xcite .",
    "whilst there has been important progress with the experimental effort , sense recognition remains one of the outstanding challenges for current and future detectors  @xcite . whether or not this information can be retrieved from a detector plays a key role in its ability to discriminate wimp induced recoils from backgrounds  @xcite .",
    "this is because in the absence of head - tail discrimination the angular recoil rates in the forward and background directions are added together and the anisotropy of the wimp induced recoils is effectively decreased .",
    "figure  [ fig : headtail ] shows how the discovery limit depends on the energy threshold for head - tail discrimination , for @xmath50 and @xmath51 and our two example detector set - ups ( table  [ tab : detectors ] ) with 3-d , 2-d and 1-d readouts . for simplicity , we assume that above ( below ) the head - tail energy threshold there is perfect ( no ) head - tail discrimination . for the light wimp and the low mass and threshold detector ,",
    "the discovery limits are weakened as the head - tail energy threshold is increased from @xmath52 to @xmath53 before flattening off to a factor between @xmath54 ( 1-d ) and @xmath46 ( 3-d ) below the energy only limit . for lower dimensional readout",
    "the decrease in sensitivity is larger and the plateau in the limit is reached for a larger head - tail energy threshold .",
    "qualitatively similar behaviour occurs for the @xmath51 wimp and the high mass and threshold detector . in this case",
    "the discovery limits flatten off to values @xmath55 below the energy only limit at a head - tail energy threshold of @xmath56 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : headtailfloors ] we show the discovery limits with and without sense recognition , as a function of wimp mass .",
    "the factor by which the discovery limit changes without sense recognition is largest for light , @xmath57 , wimps and a low threshold .",
    "the discovery limit achieved by a 3-d readout is still considerably lower than the non - directional limit however 1-d and 2-d readouts do suffer without sense recognition and are only marginally better than the non - directional limits , especially at high wimp masses .    in figure",
    "[ fig : headtailmass ] we show ( in similar fashion to fig .  [",
    "fig : detectormass ] ) the evolution of the discovery limit now as a function of detector mass for @xmath50 and @xmath51 with and without sense discrimination . as in fig .",
    "[ fig : headtailfloors ] , we see that the lack of sense recognition is most damaging in the 100 gev wimp case .",
    "this is particularly true for the 1-d and 2-d readouts where with no sense recognition there is only a factor of 1.1 and 1.2 improvement over a detector with no directional information at all and the evolution of the discovery limit suffers from the same saturation effect due to the similarity in the recoil distributions . in the 6 gev wimp case",
    "the discovery limits with no sense recognition continue to decrease past the saturation regime suffered by the non - directional limit .",
    "however there is still a reduction in sensitivity by factors of 1.9 , 2.8 and 8.9 for 3-d , 2-d and 1-d readouts respectively compared to the limits with sense recognition .",
    "interestingly , the discovery limit for 3-d readout with no sense recognition is slightly better than 1-d and 2-d readouts with sense recognition .",
    "our main conclusion regarding sense recognition is that for discriminating between solar neutrinos and low mass wimps , having 3-d readout with no method of determining sense is marginally preferable to 1-d or 2-d readout with sense determination .",
    "this is because the recoil distributions from low mass wimps and solar neutrinos are both anisotropic and have sufficient 3-d angular separation that they are still distinguishable even without recoil sense information . for the higher mass wimps",
    "this is not the case , and without sense recognition the advantage of directionality is almost entirely lost , even in 3-d .",
    "the final experimental limitation we study is that of finite angular resolution caused by the inaccuracy in the estimation of the `` true '' recoil direction .",
    "this is an inherent difficulty faced by all directional detectors .",
    "for instance , directional detectors using low pressure gas tpcs suffer from straggling effects as the recoiling nucleus collides with other gas nuclei and more importantly from the diffusion of the primary electrons while drifting toward the anode  @xcite .",
    "finite angular resolution will smear out the wimp and solar neutrino distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig : moll ] , making it more difficult to discriminate between the two .",
    "since the minimum separation between the peak wimp and neutrino directions is @xmath58 , an angular resolution better than this will likely be required to differentiate between the wimp and solar neutrino distributions .",
    "finite angular resolution results in a recoil in the direction @xmath59 being reconstructed in the direction @xmath60 with a probability distribution that has the form of a gaussian smoothing kernel on a sphere  @xcite k(_r,_r ) = , where @xmath61 is the angle between the original and reconstructed directions , = + , in the co - ordinates defined in eq .",

    "[ fig : angressingle ] for @xmath50 and @xmath51 for our two example detector set - ups ( table  [ tab : detectors ] ) with 3-d readout .",
    "as expected , finite resolution makes it harder to discriminate a @xmath64 wimp from solar neutrinos .",
    "the discovery limit is an order of magnitude weaker for @xmath65 than for perfect angular resolution , and for @xmath66 the limit is only marginally better than that obtained using energy information only . for the heavier wimp and the more massive detector , the discovery limit only has a slight change with increasing @xmath63 .",
    "this is because the finite angular resolution affects only the wimp signal and not the isotropic background from atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "however in this case the improvement afforded with directionality , even in the ideal case , is smaller .",
    "figure  [ fig : angresfloors ] shows the discovery limits for the two detector set - ups as a function of wimp mass and angular resolution .",
    "finite angular resolution significantly limits the ability of a low threshold directional detector to discriminate light , @xmath57 , wimps from solar neutrinos .",
    "the effects of finite angular resolution are greatest for @xmath67 gev , when the energy spectra of wimps and @xmath2b neutrinos match one another .",
    "for the high threshold detector the reverse behaviour is observed . at higher wimp masses",
    "the effect of increasing angular resolution is more apparent than at lower masses ( @xmath68 gev ) , this is because the anisotropy of the recoil distribution decreases with increasing wimp mass .",
    "the main conclusion of this sub - section is that angular resolution of order @xmath65 or better is required to exploit the different directional signals of light wimps and solar neutrinos . for angular resolutions larger than this there is little benefit from having the directional information at all as the solar neutrino and wimp signals are poorly resolved . for heavier wimps the neutrino floor",
    "can still be overcome even with angular resolutions up to @xmath69 .",
    "this is because the dipole asymmetry of the wimp recoil distribution has a large dispersion and the effect of smearing due to finite angular resolution is less significant .",
    "therefore for light wimps probing cross - sections below the @xmath2b neutrino floor requires good angular resolution , however for the atmospheric neutrino floor the experimental limits can be competitive even with only modest angular resolution .",
    "we have studied in detail how direct detection experiments with directional sensitivity can subtract the background due to coherent neutrino - nucleus scattering and circumvent the so - called neutrino floor over a wide range of wimp masses . in particular for light wimps ( which have a similar recoil energy spectrum to @xmath2b solar neutrinos )",
    "directionality would allow a ton - scale low threshold detector to be sensitive to cross - sections several orders of magnitude below the neutrino floor .",
    "we have also shown that experiments that can only measure 1-d or 2-d projections of the recoil tracks can still discriminate wimps from neutrino backgrounds .    moving beyond ideal detectors",
    ", we studied the effects of finite angular resolution and limited sense recognition .",
    "the angular distributions of wimp and solar neutrino induced recoils are sufficiently different that for light wimps sense recognition is not crucial .",
    "the discovery limits are a factor of roughly two and ten worse without sense recognition for 3-d and 1-d readout respectively .",
    "however the discovery limits still improve strongly with increasing exposure .",
    "the discovery limit for 3-d readout with no sense recognition is slightly better than 1-d and 2-d readouts _ with _ sense recognition . for heavier wimps ,",
    "however , sense recognition is required to discriminate wimps from the isotropic background from atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "finally we found that if the angular resolution is worse than of order thirty degrees , then it becomes significantly more difficult to discriminate between light wimps and solar neutrinos .",
    "angular resolution is less crucial for distinguishing heavier wimps from isotropic atmospheric neutrino ( although in this case the improvement offered by an ideal directional detector is smaller ) .",
    "we have used xenon as a target nucleus throughout , although we note that no directional dark matter detectors using this material currently exist ( and the only proposed directional detection strategy using xe has a 1-d readout  @xcite ) .",
    "using xenon allows our results to be easily compared with previous studies of the neutrino floor  @xcite and simplifies the analysis as it is not necessary to consider the effects of multiple target nuclei , as is the case with cf@xmath70 which is most commonly used in current low pressure gas tpcs  @xcite .",
    "moreover , multiple target experiments and their complementarity have already been studied extensively in ref .",
    "we have also not accounted for astrophysical uncertainties both in the values of parameters such as the escape speed and lab velocity but also in the shape of the velocity distribution .",
    "@xcite studied the effect on the light wimp neutrino floor of a non - maxwellian speed distribution and a distribution containing a stream .",
    "it found that the inclusion of time information allowed the additional uncertainty from the speed distribution to be overcome , and the neutrino floor suppressed .",
