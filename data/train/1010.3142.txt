    "we consider a connection level model for internet congestion control that was first studied by massouli and roberts @xcite .",
    "this stochastic model represents the randomly varying number of flows in a network for which bandwidth is dynamically shared among flows that correspond to the transfer of documents along specified routes .",
    "standard bandwidth sharing policies are the weighted @xmath0-fair , @xmath3 , and the weighted max  min fair policies .",
    "an important example of the former is the proportionally fair policy , which corresponds to @xmath4 .",
    "the weighted max ",
    "min fair policy corresponds to @xmath5 .",
    "these policies allocate service uniformly to documents along a given route , and allocate service amongst different routes in a `` fair '' manner .",
    "a question of considerable interest is when such policies are stable .",
    "de veciana , lee and konstantopoulos @xcite studied the stability of weighted max ",
    "min fair and proportionally fair policies ; bonald and massouli @xcite studied the stability of weighted @xmath0-fair policies .",
    "both papers assumed exponentially distributed interarrival and service times for documents .",
    "the first condition is equivalent to poisson arrivals , and the second condition corresponds to exponentially distributed document sizes with documents processed at a constant rate .",
    "both papers constructed lyapunov functions which imply the stability of such models when the models are subcritical , that is , the underlying markov process is positive harris recurrent when the average load at each link is less than its capacity .    relatively little",
    "is currently known regarding the stability of subcritical networks with general interarrival and service times .",
    "massouli @xcite showed stability for the proportionally fair policy for exponentially distributed interarrival times and general service times that are of phase type .",
    "a suitable lyapunov function was employed to show stability .",
    "the stability problem for bandwidth sharing policies is in certain aspects similar to the analogous problem for multiclass queueing networks .",
    "a significant complication that arises in the context of bandwidth sharing policies is the requirement of simultaneous service of documents at all links along a route .",
    "this can reduce the efficiency of service , and complicates analysis when the interarrival and service times are not exponentially distributed .",
    "when the interarrival and service times are exponentially distributed , finer results are possible . in kang",
    "@xcite , a diffusion approximation is established under weighted proportionally fair policies .",
    "there and in gromoll and williams @xcite , summaries and a more detailed bibliography are provided for different bandwidth sharing policies , for both exponentially distributed and more general interarrival and service times .    here",
    ", we investigate the behavior of weighted max  min fair policies for subcritical networks whose interarrival and service times have general distributions .",
    "we show that such networks are stable , provided that the service distributions have @xmath1 moments for some @xmath2 .",
    "no conclusion is reached when fewer moments exist . as in previous papers on stability",
    ", we construct a suitable lyapunov function . because of the more general framework here",
    ", the markov process underlying the model will now have a general state space , and will require the machinery associated with positive harris recurrence .",
