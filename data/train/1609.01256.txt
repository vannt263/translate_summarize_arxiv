    "it is dynamically described by the critical angle @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the longitude of the secondary pericenter .",
    "the physical effects of lers and cers are not the same : the cer mainly affects the semi - major axis of the test particle and keeps its orbital eccentricity almost constant , forcing the particle to librate inside so - called corotation sites like a simple pendulum .",
    "in contrast , the ler acts on its eccentricity but keeps the semi - major axis almost constant @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we derive the probability of capturing a test particle into an isolated cer , as both the secondary and the particle suffer orbital migration that secularly change their semi - major axes .",
    "this is a novel calculation that complements what has been done before in the case of lers .",
    "the term  isolated \" means here that the cer and ler are sufficiently pulled apart so that their coupling is negligible .",
    "eventually , the goal is to extend the study of captures into mmr to more realistic cases where both the cer and ler act in concert on the particle , but this will not be considered here .",

    "we note here that the capture of a particle into a cer bears some resemblance with the capture of a rotating body into spin - orbit resonance @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "a slow effect ( orbital migration in our case , tidal friction for the spin - orbit resonances ) drives a pendulum - like system into a librating state , possibly capturing it permanently into that state .",

    "<S> we study in this paper the capture of a massless particle into an isolated , first order corotation eccentric resonance ( cer ) , in the framework of the planar , eccentric and restricted three - body problem near a @xmath0 mean motion commensurability ( @xmath1 integer ) . while capture into lindblad eccentric resonances ( where the perturber s orbit is circular ) has been investigated years ago , capture into cer ( where the perturber s orbit is elliptic ) has not yet been investigated in detail . here , we derive the generic equations of motion near a cer in the general case where both the perturber and the test particle migrate . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the probability of capture in that context , and we examine more closely two particular cases : @xmath2 if only the perturber is migrating , capture is possible only if the migration is outward from the primary . </S>",
    "<S> notably , the probability of capture is independent of the way the perturber migrates outward ; @xmath3 if only the test particle is migrating , then capture is possible only if the algebraic value of its migration rate is a decreasing function of orbital radius . in this case , the probability of capture is proportional to the radial gradient of migration . </S>",
    "<S> these results differ from the capture into lindblad eccentric resonance ( ler ) , where it is necessary that the orbits of the perturber and the test particle converge for capture to be possible . </S>",
    "<S> possible applications for planetary satellites are discussed .    </S>",
