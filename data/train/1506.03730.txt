    "the goal of this paper is to construct @xmath0 casson - lin invariants @xmath8 for oriented links @xmath1 in @xmath2 .",
    "these invariants are defined as a signed count of conjugacy classes of certain irreducible projective @xmath0 representations of @xmath13 with a non - trivial @xmath14-cocycle .",
    "given an oriented link @xmath1 with @xmath4 components , the @xmath14-cocycle is determined by an @xmath4-tuple @xmath15 of labels , and the choice of labels is made so that the resulting @xmath14-cocycle is nontrivial .",
    "this is critical in what follows because it prohibits the existence of reducibles , see proposition [ noreducibles ] .",
    "we denote the resulting algebraic count as @xmath16 , and the following theorem is the main result of this paper",
    ".    * theorem .",
    "* suppose @xmath17 is an oriented @xmath4-component link with @xmath18 and @xmath19 is an allowable @xmath4-tuple of labels .",
    "then the integer @xmath16 is a well - defined invariant of @xmath1 .",
    "we briefly outline how the above theorem is established . by alexander",
    "s theorem @xcite , every link @xmath17 can be realized as the closure @xmath20 for some braid @xmath21 the braid group @xmath22 acts naturally on the free group @xmath23 , and this induces an action on the space of @xmath0 representations of @xmath24 which we denote as @xmath25    we extend this action to the wreath product @xmath26 as follows .",
    "identifying @xmath27 with the center of @xmath0 , then for @xmath28 and @xmath29 , we set @xmath30 this extends the braid group action on @xmath31 to an action of @xmath26 , and in fact every fixed point @xmath32 can be identified with a projective representation of the link group @xmath33    the key result is proposition [ noreducibles ] , which shows that every element @xmath34 is irreducible .",
    "consequently , writing @xmath35 for the subspace of irreducible @xmath0 representations , proposition [ noreducibles ] implies that the graph @xmath36 and the diagonal @xmath37 intersect in a compact subset of @xmath38 .",
    "it follows that one can arrange transversality of the intersection @xmath39 by a compactly supported isotopy , and using natural orientations on the quotients @xmath40 and @xmath41 , we define @xmath42 as the oriented intersection number of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "our main result is then established by showing that @xmath42 is independent of the choice of compatible @xmath45-tuple @xmath46 ( proposition [ indepofep ] ) , and that it is invariant under the two markov moves ( propositions [ markov1 ] and [ markov2 ] ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath16 gives a well - defined invariant of the link @xmath17 .",
    "one of the virtues of this approach is that it leads to a direct method for computing the invariants , and we illustrate this by computing @xmath8 for the hopf link and for chain links ( propositions [ prop - hopf ] and [ prop - chain ] ) and by showing that the invariants vanish for split links ( proposition [ splitlinks ] ) .",
    "one motivation for defining link invariants in terms of the @xmath0 representations of the link group is that these representations can be identified with flat connections on a principal @xmath0 bundle over the link exterior , which allows for a gauge theoretic interpretation .",
    "this approach was originally used by taubes to interpret casson s invariant @xmath47 of homology @xmath48-spheres @xmath49 in terms of flat @xmath11 connections @xcite , and using similar ideas , floer defined @xmath50-graded groups @xmath51 called the instanton floer homology and whose euler characteristic equals the casson invariant @xcite .",
    "the casson - lin invariants can also be interpreted gauge theoretically , as we now explain .",
    "the casson - lin invariant was originally defined in @xcite by x .- s .",
    "lin , who described an invariant @xmath52 of knots @xmath53 as an algebraic count of conjugacy classes of _ tracefree _ irreducible @xmath11 representations of @xmath54 and proved that @xmath55 , half the signature of @xmath56 . in @xcite ,",
    "c. herald used gauge theory to define an extended casson - lin invariant @xmath57 for knots @xmath58 in homology 3-spheres which allows for more general meridional trace conditions , and he generalized lin s formula by showing that @xmath59 , half the tristram - levine @xmath60-twisted signature of @xmath56 .",
    "( similar results were obtained by m. heusener and j. kroll in @xcite . )",
    "o. collin and b. steer then used moduli spaces of orbifold connections to define an associated floer homology theory for knots whose euler characteristic equals @xmath57 in @xcite , and p. kronheimer and t. mrowka further developed the instanton floer homology theory of knots in @xcite , and they used it to prove a strong nontriviality result for khovanov homology in @xcite .",
    "the second author and n. saveliev used projective @xmath11 representations to extend the casson - lin invariant to 2-component links @xmath1 in @xmath2 in @xcite , and they showed that @xmath61 , the linking number of @xmath62 .",
    "they gave a gauge theoretic description of the invariant @xmath63 in @xcite , where they also described floer homology groups with euler characteristic equal to @xmath63 .",
    "in view of all of these results , it is natural to ask whether the @xmath0 casson - lin invariants introduced here can also be interpreted gauge theoretically .",
    "we plan to address this question in a future article using moduli spaces of projective @xmath0 representations ( cf .",
    "we hope to use this approach to extend the casson - lin invariants @xmath8 to links @xmath64 in homology 3-spheres and to describe corresponding floer homology groups .",
    "in particular , we expect this approach will help clarify the relationship between the invariants @xmath8 studied here and the @xmath0 instanton floer groups constructed by kronheimer and mrowka in @xcite .",
    "it is possible that this approach will also shed light on other interesting questions , such as whether and how the casson - lin invariants are related to classical link invariants , such as the higher linking numbers .",
