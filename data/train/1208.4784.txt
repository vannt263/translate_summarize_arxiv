    "the possible importance of codimension one membrane - like topological charge structures in the qcd vacuum is suggested by both theoretical considerations @xcite and by monte carlo studies @xcite . theoretically , the suggestion of topological domain wall structures in the vacuum emerged from large-@xmath0 chiral lagrangian arguments .",
    "these arguments showed that , in the large-@xmath0 limit the multivaluedness of the effective @xmath4 mass term induced by the chiral @xmath3 anomaly implies the existence of multiple , discrete , quasistable , and nearly degenerate `` k - vacua '' .",
    "these vacua are labeled by effective local values of the qcd @xmath5 parameter which differ by integer multiples of @xmath6 , and are separated by domain walls where the value of @xmath5 jumps by @xmath7 . with the emergence of the holographic string theory framework for qcd - like gauge theories @xcite , it was shown that the role of the domain wall predicted by large @xmath0 was played by the @xmath1 brane of iia string theory .",
    "( more precisely , by an `` @xmath8 brane '' which is the intersection of the @xmath1 brane with the @xmath9 color branes @xcite . ) in the holographic framework the local @xmath5 parameter is given by the wilson line of the closed string ramond - ramond u(1 ) gauge field around the compactified direction of the @xmath9 branes . in 9 + 1 dimensions",
    ", a @xmath1 brane plays the role of a magnetic monopole source for the rr field , and is dual to an instanton , which is represented by a @xmath10 brane in the holographic model .",
    "the incompatibility of the instanton model with large @xmath0 chiral dynamics @xcite indicated that , at least for sufficiently large @xmath0 , instantons should be replaced by codimension one membranes or domain walls .. from the 9 + 1-dimensional string viewpoint , the membrane - dominated vacuum is in a precise sense dual to the instanton vacuum , with instantons ( d0 branes ) and domain walls ( d6 branes ) being , respectively , electric and magnetic sources of ramond - ramond field .",
    "the success of large @xmath0 phenomenology , combined with the monte carlo evidence for topological charge membranes in @xmath11 gauge theory @xcite strongly indicates that @xmath12 is large enough that the membrane - dominated vacuum is the correct qualitative picture for real qcd . in 4-dimensional spacetime",
    ", a @xmath1 brane appears as a 2 + 1 dimensional intersection with the color branes , with the other 4 spatial dimensions of the @xmath1 brane compactified on an @xmath13 . as a color excitation",
    ", the @xmath1 brane appears as a codimension one dipole layer of topological charge in the gauge field .",
    "the quantized jump in the value of @xmath5 across the membrane is just the dirac quantization condition for rr monopoles . in this paper , we show that the existence and dynamics of these topological membranes in the qcd vacuum can be studied without reference to the higher - dimensional string theory framework , using the descent equations and cohomology structure of 4-dimensional yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "this provides a `` bottom - up '' perspective on the holographic framework .",
    "it also identifies the exact mechanism by which the rr u(1 ) gauge field remains in 4-dimensional qcd as an auxiliary field representing singular membrane - like excitations of the yang - mills field .",
    "we consider 4d su(n ) yang - mills theory and , in order to construct a domain wall , we add an external source coupled to topological charge , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the yang - mills topological charge density , and @xmath16 represents the local value of the theta parameter . we construct a straight flat membrane or domain wall by taking @xmath16 to be a step function along one spatial direction , which we label @xmath17 , with discontinuity @xmath18 , @xmath19 this produces a codimension one membrane occupying the dimensions transverse to @xmath17 .",
    "integrating by parts , we can write the source term as an integral on the surface of the brane , where the integrand is proportional to the chern - simons current , @xmath20 whose divergence is proportional to the topological charge density , @xmath21 the term in the action is thus expressed in terms of yang - mills fields localized to the brane surface , but it is no longer explicitly gauge invariant ( because we have discarded a surface term at @xmath22 ) . the gauge variation of the cs 3-form in ( [ eq : cscurrent ] ) is dictated by the descent equations @xcite , and can be written formally as the exterior derivative of a 2-form . however , one of the terms in the resulting 2-dimensional surface integral has a topological ambiguity .",
    "it has the form of a wess - zumino - witten term and is only defined modulo @xmath6 times an integer which identifies the winding number of the gauge transformation in the 3-volume enclosed by the 2d surface .",
    "gauge invariance of the exponentiated wzw term requires the integer quantization of the coupling constant , which in this case is @xmath23 . in this way we find that the quantization of the step in @xmath5 across the domain wall follows from the requirement of invariance under `` large '' gauge transformations , in a manner similar to the quantization of the wzw coupling constant in 2d sigma models .",
    "next we show that by considering small , nontopological gauge transformations we obtain information about the dynamics of fluctuating branes .",
    "this occurs because invariance under a 4d yang - mills gauge transformation provides a relation between the gauge variation of the chern - simons 3-form on the brane surface and the transformation of the gauge field component transverse to the brane surface .",
    "the chern - simons form that appears in the surface integral at @xmath24 depends only on the three `` in brane '' components .",
    "the transverse component of @xmath25 is related to membrane fluctuations in the transverse coordinate . a central role in this discussion",
    "is played by the descent equations of 4d yang - mills theory @xcite , which describes the intertwining of gauge cohomology with spacetime de rahm cohomology by relating gauge variations to exterior derivatives . for a curved or fluctuating membrane",
    "@xmath26 is a vector normal to the surface .",
    "this vector thus specifies the local orientation of the brane surface . in order to construct gauge invariant amplitudes in the presence of a fluctuating brane",
    ", we define the auxiliary field @xmath26 to transform under a yang - mills gauge transformation to cancel the variation of the chern - simons current on the brane surface : @xmath27 the gauge invariance constraint ( [ eq : delta_theta ] ) is an `` anomaly inflow '' condition that specifies the gauge variation of the rr field ( i.e. of @xmath16 ) that must accompany a 4d yang mills gauge transformation . in a string theory framework , the idea of anomaly inflow is important for understanding the relation between string theory in the bulk , where only closed strings propagate , and open - string gauge theories defined on lower dimensional brane surfaces .",
    "anomalous , fermionic currents of the gauge theory are seen as currents which are conserved overall , but which can flow onto and off of the brane surface , so only the combination of brane and bulk current is conserved . from the reverse perspective of the bulk theory , anomaly inflow is a generalization of the dirac monopole construction , with the bianchi identity being preserved by a cancellation between the bulk magnetic flux and that carried away by the dirac string .",
    "normally one would expect that the axial @xmath3 anomaly in qcd could only be interpreted in terms of anomaly inflow by embedding it in a higher dimensional `` bulk '' theory , e.g. type iia string theory in 10 dimensions .",
    "however , the role of codimension one membranes in the vacuum of 4-dimensional qcd allows the anomaly inflow mechanism to be operative in a strictly 4-dimensional context , with the spatial direction transverse to the membrane playing the role of a bulk coordinate .    in the case of the axial @xmath3 anomaly in qcd the physical gauge invariant flavor singlet axial current @xmath28 is not conserved , @xmath29 , but it is sometimes convenient to introduce a conserved , non - gauge invariant axial current @xmath30 by subtracting off the chern - simons current of the gauge field , @xmath31 which is conserved by eq .",
    "( [ eq : anomaly2 ] ) . here",
    "we interpret this construction as an anomaly inflow constraint .",
    "if only the in - brane components of the gauge field are nonzero , the chern - simons current @xmath32 is a vector transverse to the brane whose support is localized on the membrane surface . away from the brane surface , in the 4-dimensional bulk , the axial current is both conserved and gauge invariant .",
    "the nonconservation of the current @xmath28 occurs only on the brane surface , where it can be carried away in the form of surface currents associated with the gauge variation of the chern - simons 3-form .    as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the anomaly inflow condition ( [ eq : delta_theta ] ) enforces a kogut - susskind cancellation @xcite between massless poles coupled to the ( separately non gauge invariant ) operators @xmath33 and @xmath34 , so that there are no massless poles coupled to the gauge invariant combination @xmath35 . in the holographic description , this invokes the anomaly inflow requirement that the gauge variation of the cs 3-form on the i2 brane should be cancelled by a gauge variation of the bulk rr field on the brane surface @xcite .",
    "the kogut - susskind cancellation of massless poles in gauge invariant amplitudes is a manifestation of the gauge invariance that connects the in - brane components of the gauge field to the transverse component .",
    "as we will discuss in detail for the 2-dimensional case considered in section ii , this relates the chern - simons current on the brane to the local spacetime orientation of the brane surface .    in 4d yang - mills theory ,",
    "the gauge cancellation ( [ eq : delta_theta ] ) specifies a relation between a 3d yang - mills transformation within the brane and a change of the local orientation of the brane surface , as determined by @xmath33 . in this way",
    ", we relate the variation of @xmath26 to the 1-cocycle of the @xmath36 gauge transformation @xmath37 , as constructed from the descent equations @xcite . for our purposes ,",
    "a 1-cocycle can be thought of as a `` berry phase '' associated with transporting a representation of the gauge group around a closed orbit in the parameter space of gauge transformations .",
    "the cocycle is a functional of the gauge transformation and is given by the integral of a local 2-form density over the surface of the brane at fixed time ..",
    "the 1-cocycle that is attached to a 2-dimensional brane surface is constructed from the topological charge by the descent procedure @xcite .",

    "it depends not only on the values of @xmath46 on the 2-dimensional boundary , but on its winding number in the enclosed 3-dimensional volume . the second term in ( [ eq : csvariation ] )",
    "describes an interaction between the wzw current and the yang - mills gauge potential , @xmath47\\ ] ] this is a single - valued , nontopological contribution to the 1-cocycle .",
    "it describes the emission of gluons which accompanies brane fluctuations .",
    "the basic idea of our formulation of brane dynamics in gauge theory is illustrated in a particularly simple context by the case of 2-dimensional @xmath3 gauge theory . for this case ,",
    "the chern - simons current is @xmath48 , and the analog of the descent equation ( [ eq : csvariation ] ) is simply related to the gauge transformation @xmath49 itself , @xmath50 for definiteness , we consider the schwinger model ( 2-dimensional qed ) , but most of the discussion applies equally well to the 2-dimensional @xmath51 sigma model .",
    "as described in the introduction , we construct a codimension one membrane by including a topological source term @xmath52 for notational simplicity , we denote the coordinates by @xmath53 and take the source field to be a spatial step function at @xmath54 , @xmath55 integrating by parts , we see that the source term is equivalent to an ordinary wilson line operator of the gauge field , @xmath56 we consider the variation of this term under a u(1 ) gauge transformation @xmath57 .",
    "if we compactify the @xmath58 coordinate over a finite range from 0 to @xmath59 , the variation is given by @xmath60 = - \\theta_0   n\\ ] ] imposing periodic boundary conditions on @xmath46 requires @xmath61 to be an integer .",
    "thus the gauge variation of @xmath62 depends on the winding number of the @xmath3 gauge phase around the compactified @xmath58-axis .",
    "gauge invariance of @xmath63 requires that the coefficient @xmath23 in ( [ eq : line - cycle ] ) is an integer .",
    "this is the simplest example of gauge group cohomology , where the 1-cocycle associated with the group element @xmath49 is just @xmath64 , the gauge phase itself .",
    "since @xmath65 , the phase ( [ eq : line - cycle ] ) is given by the gauge variation of the chern - simons 1-form integrated over the wilson line . in the case of 4d yang - mills theory , a similar argument applies , where the 1-cocycle is obtained from the descent equations , and is given by the gauge variation of the chern - simons 3-form @xcite integrated over the brane surface .",
    "now let us allow the brane defined by ( [ eq : theta_2d ] ) to fluctuate around its flat starting position at @xmath54 .",
    "the vector @xmath26 is a vector normal to the brane surface and thus specifies its local orientation . in the schwinger model , this can be identified with the conserved , non - gauge invariant axial vector current @xmath66 .",
    "here @xmath30 is an auxiliary free fermion current which couples to an unphysical massless goldstone boson in the covariant gauge formulation of the model @xcite .",
    "its introduction explicitly separates the fermionic component of the axial current from the gauge anomaly .",
    "the gauge invariant current @xmath28 is related to the conserved current by @xmath67 where @xmath68 . here",
    ", @xmath28 is the physical axial vector current which includes the anomaly .",
    "note that if we interpret the wilson line in the usual way as a charged particle world line representing the flow of vector current @xmath69 , then @xmath70 is always normal to the wilson line .",
    "the kogut - susskind mechanism @xcite has a simple physical interpretation as the separation of a physical charged particle into the bare particle and its comoving gauge field .",
    "a proper gauge invariant particle state must include both the particle and its surrounding field .",
    "but in order to quantize in a covariant gauge , the ks pole cancellation mechanism must be employed .",
    "this introduces two massless scalar fields associated with the two terms on the right hand side of ( [ eq : gi_current ] ) .",
    "the field representing @xmath30 is an ordinary massless boson field , but the one representing the gauge anomaly term in ( [ eq : gi_current ] ) is a massless ghost field .",
    "physical , gauge invariant amplitudes are constructed with operators that only contain the gauge invariant sum of the two fields , and massless poles cancel .",
    "the physical spectrum has a mass gap given by the mass of the schwinger boson @xmath71 , which is the analog of the @xmath4 in qcd .",
    "the ks mechanism is thus a cancellation between the long range effects which would be induced by separately varying the position of a particle and that of its surrounding gauge field .",
    "varying either one separately would induce long range effects , but if the particle and its surrounding field are varied together , as required physically , the effects are short range , and there are no massless particles in gauge invariant amplitudes .",
    "when expressed in terms of branes in the gauge field , the kogut - susskind mechanism generalizes straightforwardly to the case of 4-dimensional qcd . in the 2d case",
    "the charge carrying object is a pointlike bare fermion , while in 4d qcd it is the codimension - one @xmath5 membrane .",
    "the kogut - susskind mechanism is a cancellation between the massless fluctuations of the membrane surface , described by @xmath33 , and the wrong - sign massless pole in the chern - simons current correlator @xcite .",
    "in order to calculate the contribution of a brane to the topological susceptibility in 2d u(1 ) gauge theory , consider the calculation of a wilson loop around a contour @xmath72 that cuts across a membrane , as depicted in fig . [",

    ", we first consider the case of a straight brane along the y - axis . as in the case of a dirac - wu - yang monopole",
    ", a description of such a field configuration with no unphysical singularities requires that the @xmath73 field ( as well as the ramond - ramond field @xmath5 ) to the left and right of the brane must be written in different gauges @xmath74 and @xmath75 . at the location of the brane along the y - axis",
    ", we must match the field description to the left and right of the brane by a gauge transformation @xmath49 defined on the surface of the brane , @xmath76    we can now identify the contribution of the membrane to the wilson loop integral around the contour @xmath72 by writing it in terms of the two closed subcontours @xmath77 and @xmath78 , which do not cross the brane .",
    "the wilson loop integral is given by the sum of the contributions from the two subcontours @xmath77 and @xmath78 , plus a contribution from the membrane surface coming from the gauge mismatch between the two contours , @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the two points where the contour @xmath72 punctures the membrane .",
    "the effect of the membrane on the wilson loop is to add a phase @xmath82 this is just the wu - yang prescription for the phase of a charged particle propagating in the field of a magnetic monopole : in addition to the @xmath25 phase , if the particle passes from one coordinate patch to another one in a different gauge , the wilson loop phase receives a contribution from the gauge transformation that matches the fields along the interface between sections .    in ( [ eq : brane_action ] ) the gauge transformation @xmath49 which specifies the matching across the brane depends only on the in - brane y - coordinate and appears only in the difference of the @xmath83 components of the gauge field .",
    "the gauge component @xmath84 transverse to the brane does not enter into the matching .",
    "however , the definition of @xmath46 as the transformation which matches the gauge on the two sides of the brane indicates that it should be regarded as localized to the brane at @xmath54 .",
    "for this reason , we define a gauge transformation @xmath85 , where @xmath86 on a lattice , this would be a gauge transformation that is applied only on a single row of sites along the brane at @xmath54 . in the continuum description employed here",
    ", the gauge transformation @xmath87 always appears in the form of either @xmath88 or @xmath89 , so ( [ eq : omega_delta ] ) always leads to well - defined expressions in terms of delta functions and derivatives thereof .",
    "the separation of a singular bulk gauge transformation at a brane surface into a transformation depending only on the in - brane coordinates multiplied by a delta function in the transverse coordinate will play a central role in the following discussion .",
    "small non - topological variations of the gauge transformation @xmath46 are related by anomaly inflow to local fluctuations of the surface orientation vector @xmath33 . in this way , the gauge transformation @xmath46 which matches the fields on the two sides of the brane is promoted to a dynamical field describing fluctuations on the surface of the brane .",
    "this seems surprising at first , since a gauge transformation should not produce a physical excitation .",
    "the key point is that the transformation of the in - brane component(s ) of the @xmath25 field is not a gauge transformation in the bulk theory unless it is accompanied by a transformation of the transverse component @xmath84 .",
    "the cohomology of the wilson line and the brane action ( [ eq : brane_action ] ) depends only on the component within the brane @xmath83 , and not on the transverse component @xmath84 . in general",
    ", we can distinguish between transformation of the in - brane components of the gauge field , which determines the gauge cohomology , and transformation of the transverse component , which , by a certain choice of gauge , can be interpreted as transverse motion of the brane surface .",
    "let @xmath85 be a gauge transformation defined in 2d space - time , @xmath90 , and define separately the transformation of the @xmath91 and @xmath58 components of the @xmath92 field , @xmath93 where we choose @xmath91 to be transverse and @xmath58 parallel to the brane .",
    "for example , a straight , uniform brane along the y - axis at @xmath54 is represented by @xmath94 for the gauge function @xmath95 giving the transformations @xmath96 while the combined effect of @xmath97 and @xmath94 is a gauge transformation , the transformation @xmath94 by itself inserts a physical membrane into the system .",
    "when we generalize this to 4d yang - mills , the phase @xmath98 in ( [ eq : omega_delta ] ) will be replaced by a wzw 2-form on the 2 + 1-dimensional brane .",
    "for the 2d case , we can write any gauge field in the 2d plane in a transverse / longitudinal decomposition , @xmath99 a uniform brane along the y - axis corresponds to a gauge configuration @xmath100 which is obtained from ( [ eq : trans - long ] ) with @xmath101 ( here we use upper case @xmath102 to denote a unit step function . )",
    "the field strength for this configuration is a dipole layer of topological charge , @xmath103    a general variation of the chern - simons current includes both a physical variation @xmath104 and a gauge variation @xmath105 , @xmath106 let s now consider the effect of an infinitesimal transformation applied only to the in - brane component @xmath83 of the brane configuration ( [ eq : inbrane ] ) , @xmath107 corresponding to the physical variation of the discontinuity of the gauge field across the brane , @xmath108 this excitation also varies the density of the topological charge dipole layer , @xmath109 on the other hand , the @xmath83 field in ( [ eq : avariation ] ) can also be obtained by an in - brane gauge transformation of the form ( [ eq : omega_delta ] ) , @xmath110 this gives the same variation of the in - brane component as in ( [ eq : avariation ] ) , @xmath111 but also introduces transverse `` brane fuzz '' @xmath112 which cancels the variation ( [ eq : fvar ] ) from @xmath113 to give a net @xmath114 .    we can now combine the variation ( [ eq : sigvar ] ) with the gauge transformation ( [ eq : omegavar ] ) to show that the in - brane gauge variation of @xmath83 ( [ eq : avariation ] ) is gauge equivalent to a uniform infinitesimal spacetime rotation of the membrane in the @xmath91-@xmath58 plane .",
    "we perform physical and gauge variations whose combined effect leaves the @xmath83 component of the field unchanged , @xmath115 this leads to a variation of the chern - simons vector that can be interpreted as an infinitesimal spacetime rotation of the original brane configuration ( [ eq : inbrane ] ) , as depicted in fig .",

    "by repeatedly applying infinitesimal in - brane transformations of the form ( [ eq : inbrane_transformation ] ) alternated with bulk gauge transformations , we can extend this identification to the case of finite rotations and finite in - brane gauge transformations .",

    "the quantization that results from this mapping is not quantization of localized topological charge , but rather , the quantization of the step - function discontinuity of the @xmath5 field across the brane .",
    "since the identification between the in - brane gauge transformation and the orientation of the brane surface can be made locally along the brane , the previous argument can be extended to describe any infinitesimal fluctuations of the brane .",
    "as we will discuss in the next section , the relation imposed by the anomaly inflow constraint between transformation of the in - brane component(s ) of @xmath92 and the fluctuations of the brane surface represented by the @xmath5 field generalizes to the 4d yang - mills case .",
    "combined with the descent equations , this provides a mathematical framework for studying the dynamics of branes and their role in qcd vacuum structure .",
