    "gauge coupling unification is considered as a very suggestive hint of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , since almost any fundamental theory describing physics at high scales predicts a sort of grand ( or string ) unification of gauge couplings .",

    "two - loop corrections can lead to little differences in the final value of @xmath22 as we will see later on in this section , where we will identify several models which belong to the same class .",
    "however two loop corrections have been found to be very stable inside the same class , since there is a compensating effect for models that unify at smaller values of @xmath3 due to the fact that they have more extra matter , and the class ( [ class ] ) leads approximatively to the same value of @xmath22 .",

    "@xcite where , using the fact that the gauge coupling is not renormalized beyond one - loop in the @xmath135 theory   projection spoils the @xmath135 supersymmetry for the zero - modes and that matter on the boundary is @xmath134 supersymmetric . ] , it was estimated that the ratio of two - to - one loop renormalization of the inverse gauge coupling goes as : @xmath199 where @xmath200 is identified here as the cutoff of the theory .",
    "this means that perturbation theory seems to be trustable but nevertheless the ( accelerated ) unification predictions are not guaranteed to survive to higher loop corrections .",
    "a preliminary calculation of two - loop corrections for scales beyond @xmath2 has shown that the leading corrections , in particular those with bulk and boundary fields mixed in the diagram , are very model dependent .",
    "in particular they depend on the distribution of matter in bulk hypermultiplets and boundary chiral multiplets .",
    "a detailed calculation of these two - loop corrections is outside the scope of this paper and will be postponed for future work .    finally , let us stress that models with extra dimensions at the tev scale are favoured by gauge coupling ` accelerated ' unification . in this case",
    "the extra dimensions could be used to trigger supersymmetry breaking by the scherk - schwarz  -theory  @xcite and always leads to a gravitino mass of the order of the inverse compactification radius which breaks supersymmetry .",
    "in this case we would have @xmath201 . ]",
    "mechanism  @xcite , and lead to observable effects in high - energy colliders by the production of kaluza - klein excitation of the mssm particles  @xcite . in particular , if we fix in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] @xmath202 tev one obtains @xmath203 for @xmath204 tev and @xmath205 for @xmath206 tev , in rather good agreement with precision data .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the unification of @xmath207 gauge couplings in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model , using the gauge couplings determination at @xmath4 deduced from lep and low energy precision measurements .",
    "we have considered two very general unification scenarios :    logarithmic unification    this is the case where unification is achieved in an @xmath134 four - dimensional theory and , therefore , the evolution of gauge couplings is logarithmic .",
    "we impose unification of general supersymmetric models and perturbativity , and obtain the unification scale @xmath3 , that we assume to be of the order of magnitude of the compactification scale where new dimensions open up , @xmath2 .",
    "power - law unification    in this case the extra dimensions open up at scales @xmath2 much lower than the unification scale and , beyond @xmath2 , gauge couplings run , as functions of the energy , with a power - law behaviour .",
    "unification happens in an ` accelerated ' way during the last stages of their evolution .",
    "the theory below @xmath2 is @xmath134 supersymmetric and beyond @xmath2 the kaluza - klein states form multiplets of @xmath135 supersymmetry .",
    "we consider , below @xmath2 the mssm , and beyond it a general class of @xmath135 models that provide the same one - loop strong coupling at @xmath4 as the mssm .",
    "the experimental range for the gauge couplings provide a corresponding band in @xmath2 , and in @xmath3 , with an upper bound , which implies in general large extra dimensions .",
    "in the case of logarithmic unification we have examined the general set of models with canonical hypercharge ( such that colorless extra fields have integer electric charge ) , and also a class of unifying string models with fractional electric charge for colorless states , with unification gauge group @xmath208 .",
    "the experimental upper bound on @xmath22 translates into an upper bound on the unification scale which is @xmath209 gev for the canonical hypercharge models and @xmath210 gev for string models .    in the case of power - law unification",
    "we have examined the general class of models which coincide with the mssm in 4d , below the compactification scale @xmath2 , and that unify in @xmath31 dimensions with the same one - loop value of @xmath22 as the mssm .",
    "inclusion of two - loop corrections below @xmath2 provides upper bounds on @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( @xmath211 gev and @xmath209 gev , respectively ) from the unification constrains .",
    "however , before drawing definite predictions in this case higher loop corrections from kaluza - klein excitations should be precisely computed .    in either case ,",
    "logarithmic or power - law unification , it is possible that the size of the required extra dimension is @xmath18 tev@xmath26 .",
    "this fact makes it possible that :    * the extra dimension have observable effects in high - energy colliders .",
    "these effects can either put lower bounds on the mass of the corresponding kk - excitations , in the case of negative searches , or enable their experimental direct discovery  @xcite .",
    "* the extra dimensions be used , as a useful mechanism to break supersymmetry by the scherk - schwarz compactification , creating a mass splitting between members of the same supermultiplet .",
    "the main features of this mechanism have been extensively studied  @xcite .    all along this paper",
    "we have used gut - like unification condition , i.e. @xmath212 where @xmath38 .",
    "this is the case in grand unification and many string theories .",
    "however in some string constructions other values of @xmath213 may appear that can help to solve in a different fashion the strong coupling problem .",
    "we wish to mention here this possibility , which has been already stressed in the literature . just to give an illustrative example ,",
    "in the case of @xmath214 the predictions of the mssm including the same corrections as those considered in section  [ logarithmic ] are : @xmath215 where @xmath22 is now in rough agreement with the experimental data .",
    "to conclude we have proved that the unification of gauge couplings , as deduced from the electroweak precision data , requires in a general class of models the presence of large extra dimensions ( as large as @xmath216 ) and/or low unification scale .",
    "we thank j.r . espinosa and g. kane for useful discussions . the work of ad was supported by the spanish education office ( mec ) under an _ fpi _ scholarship .",
