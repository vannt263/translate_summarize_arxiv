    "<S> we introduce and study an extension of the heat equation relevant to relativistic energy formula involving square root of differential operators . </S>",
    "<S> we furnish exact solutions of corresponding cauchy ( initial ) problem using the operator formalism invoking one - sided lvy stable distributions . </S>",
    "<S> we note a natural appearance of bessel polynomials which allow one the obtention of closed form solutions for a number of initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting relativistic diffusion is slower than the non - relativistic one , although it still can be termed a normal one . </S>",
    "<S> its detailed statistical characterization is presented in terms of exact evaluation of arbitrary moments and is compared with the non - relativistic case .    </S>",
    "<S> the ordinary diffusion problem is customarily treated in terms of parabolic differential equation , linking first order derivative in time and second order derivative in space of a distribution function , which in the case of the heat equation , represents a physical quantity like the behavior of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the extension of the equation to include relativistic effects has been the topic of intense debate in the past , see @xcite , and particularly @xcite for extensive bibliography . </S>",
    "<S> the authors of @xcite have developed and interesting point of view displaying how the brownian motion underlying ordinary diffusion is extended to relativistic realm . according to @xcite the problem </S>",
    "<S> is ruled by the telegrapher equation , thus finding agreement with the original cattaneo s treatment of the problem @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the interest of their analysis stems from the fact that they emphasize the intimate connection between the stochastic process described by the telegrapher equation and the dirac equation .    </S>",
    "<S> in this note we develop an alternative point of view which takes advantage of the concepts of anomalous diffusion @xcite governed by the evolution equations involving square root pseudo - differential operators . </S>",

    "<S> ( so - called pseudo - differential operators @xcite ) is usually resolved by introducing the wave functions with several components , like in pauli and in dirac equations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however the interest for equations involving pseudo - differential operators arose even before the inception of the dirac equation . </S>",
    "<S> it can be traced back to h. weyl @xcite . the fact that eqs . and correctly reproduce the nr limit is reminiscent of the r extension of the analogy between the schrdinger and the heat equations , carried out in 1984 in @xcite , by identifying the underlying poisson processes . </S>",
    "<S> their real version obeys the telegrapher s equation , which , when analytically continued , produce the dirac equation . to see how this circumstance mirrors in our context , we square the operator of eq . </S>",
    "<S> and we get : @xmath15 where the ensemble of solutions of @xmath16 contains the solutions of eq . . </S>",
    "<S> note that eq . </S>",
    "<S> is similar but not identical to the telegrapher s equation @xcite , also referred to as the cattaneo equation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we can shed another light on eqs . and by modifying the definition of constants in eq . : </S>",
