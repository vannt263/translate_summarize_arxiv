    "topological orders and their related quantum phenomena have attracted a lot of attention in the last few years @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting model which shows a topological order is the kitaev chain @xcite .",
    "this model describes a p - wave superconducting wire that , under certain conditions , has a gapped bulk together with zero energy unpaired majorana modes localized at the edges of the system , which are robust against disorder @xcite , local impurities @xcite or dynamical perturbations @xcite .",
    "the presence of such modes has recently been observed experimentally @xcite and optical implementations of generalized kitaev model have been proposed @xcite .",
    "this one - dimensional system represents the simpliest playground for designing topological quantum computers @xcite , because of its straightforward mapping to a spin system @xcite .",
    "an extension of the kiteav model has been recently proposed by considering a longer range in the hopping and pairing terms appearing in the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "we will consider such a situation for both long - range and finite - range interactions . in the latter case ,",
    "if time reversal symmetry ( trs ) holds , one can get many majorana zero modes ( mzms ) per edge as in the case of multiband spin - orbit coupled superconductor nanowire with parallel zeeman splitting @xcite . in this case , according to standard symmetry classification @xcite , the system belongs to the class bdi , and the number of zero modes is dictated by the @xmath0-valued topological invariant ( ti ) winding number @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , for certain range of parameters , the number of majorana modes can be equal to the number of neighbors .",
    "if time reversal symmetry is broken , the system belongs to class @xmath2 and one can have at most one majorana zero mode per edge @xcite in the regime of parameters where the pfaffian @xmath3 topological invariant @xcite is not trivial .",
    "it has been shown that such invariant , related to the fermionic parity of the ground state , corresponds to the quantized zak - berry phase @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study in a systematic way the phase diagrams of the extended kitaev model , considering also the long - range limit both in the presence and in the absence of time reversal symmetry , by calculating the topological invariants and performing exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian .",
    "we also provide a detailed derivation of the transfer matrix approach in the case where a generic number of neighbors are involved in the couplings and many majorana states are located at the edges , consistently with the topological invariant analysis .",
    "we propose an extended kitaev chain model taking into account @xmath4 neighbor interactions in the hopping and pairing terms .",
    "we assume both of these interactions to be algebraically decreasing with the distance between two different lattice sites . the model with infinitely long - range pairing has been studied in ref .",
    "this model shows , for certain physical regimes , majorana zero modes and massive edge modes identified as topological massive dirac fermions in ref .",
    "@xcite , because their energies are separated from the excited states by a finite gap even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "+ the fermionic hamiltonian we will consider , which generalizes the kitaev chain , is the following @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the number of lattice sites and @xmath7 the chemical potential . the extended hopping and pairing coupling terms , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , can be generic variables , although , in what follows , we will assume the following form for those parameters @xmath10 which couple the lattice site @xmath11 with the site @xmath12 . the hopping parameter @xmath8 can acquire a phase , @xmath13 , with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 real values , in the case of broken time reversal symmetry .",

    "topological phases are described by different topological invariants according to the presence or the absence of time reversal symmetry . if time reversal is preserved ( @xmath47 )",

    "for @xmath56 we have only the hamiltonian term along @xmath57 , while the term along @xmath58 vanishes .",
    "in such a situation a good topological invariant is given by @xmath59 which can be used also for time reversal symmetry cases .",
    "here we will focus on the case of finite number of interacting neighbors .",
    "at first we will allow the hopping term to be longer ranged , keeping the pairing interaction short - ranged , and then we will consider the opposite case . at the end",
    "we will allow both terms to be longer ranged , analyzing the topological phase in the presence or in the absence of trs .",
    "we will now analyze eq .   in the limit of only extended - range hopping ,",

    "only one mzm per edge can be found , since the dependence of the pairing term on @xmath46 goes as @xmath62 and not as @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) .",

    "we now analyze longer range hamiltonian with a finite number @xmath4 of neighbors only in the pairing term , namely @xmath78 and choosing a finite @xmath22 . again the winding number , as before , can take only the values @xmath79 , however , we observe an alternation , inside the topological phase , of the values @xmath80 ( see fig .",

    "this behavior , not present in the extended hopping hamiltonian , is more emphatic as @xmath4 increases ( we are always assuming @xmath4 to be finite ) while it disappears as @xmath60 , in which case we recover the topological phase diagram of the usual kitaev model @xcite .",
    "we will look now to the topological phases when considering longer range in the hopping and in the pairing at the same time , assuming @xmath82 , in the presence or in the absence of time reversal symmetry .      after considering separately the extended range in the hopping and in the pairing ,",
    "we now include them together .",
    "the winding numbers which characterize the topological phases provide a way to count the edge modes of the chain in the open configuration @xcite . in the special case where both the hopping and the pairing terms involve many neighbors ( @xmath83 )",
    "we observe that the winding number , and therefore , the number of majorana modes at each edge , can be larger than one , up to @xmath4 . in order to prove this result ,",

    "this behavior can be explained by the fact that increasing @xmath21 for some range of parameters the high degeneracy at zero energy level is hardly sustained and it is easier for two majorana modes at the same edge to annihilate each other because of the overlap .",

    "<S> we consider the kitaev chain model with finite and infinite range in the hopping and pairing parameters , looking in particular at the appearance of majorana zero energy modes and massive edge modes . </S>",
    "<S> we study the system both in the presence and in the absence of time reversal symmetry , by means of topological invariants and exact diagonalization , disclosing very rich phase diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for extended hopping and pairing terms , we can get as many majorana modes at each end of the chain as the neighbors involved in the couplings . </S>",
    "<S> finally we generalize the transfer matrix approach useful to calculate the zero - energy majorana states at the edges for a generic number of coupled neighbors . </S>"
