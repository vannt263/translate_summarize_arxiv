    "the 2d kagome lattice being the underlying lattice of a number of materials , is of great interest due to its highly frustrated geometry with respect to the antiferromagnet .",
    "a number of these materials have larger spin . e.g. srcr@xmath2ga@xmath3o@xmath4 @xcite with spin-@xmath5 or kfe@xmath6(oh)@xmath7(so@xmath8)@xmath9 @xcite with spin-@xmath10 .",
    "with growing spin we expect the model to exhibit some behaviour captured in the classical model .",
    "this model has been studied by chalker et al @xcite by monte - carlo , spin - wave approximation and low temperature expansion . here",
    "the `` order - by - disorder '' scenario with coplanar ordering was proposed.@xcite reimers et al @xcite have performed monte - carlo runs more systematically and could confirm some of the predictions , particularly coplanar ordering .",
    "chandra et al and ritchey et al have extended the work and studied anisotropy.@xcite a cross - over for the pure case and a second - order phase transition for any inclusion of anisotropy was proposed .",
    "more recently the classical heisenberg model has been investigated by zhitomirsky @xcite with a simulated annealing method .",
    "he found a strange finite - size behaviour in the specific heat , inconsistent with a phase - transition .",
    "the antiferromagnetic order was shown to vanish in the thermodynamic limit and the so called `` octopular - order '' parameter , a third rank tensor , was proposed to describe the low temperature phase .",
    "subsequently gvozdikova et al extended the studies by inclusion of a magnetic field in the hamiltonian @xcite following earlier work of zhitomirsky.@xcite another relevant study is by korshunov , who studied the xy-@xmath11 model on the kagome and found magnetically and topologically ordered phases.@xcite + classical models with a continuous symmetry are generally not expected to show any long - range order at finite temperature , except for topological order , due to the theorem of mermin and wagner.@xcite for frustrated models the situation is more subtle , as a discrete symmetry can be induced and this symmetry can in principle be broken .",
    "this possibility was first suggested by p. chandra et al@xcite , and has been observed numerically by weber et al,@xcite .",
    "note that this does not violate the mermin - wagner theorem , as the symmetry being broken is not a continous one , but an additional discrete one .",
    "meanwhile a mathematical proof is published about such type of models,@xcite showing that such induced symmetry can be broken . in the classical nearest neighbor heisenberg - model on the kagome ( cklnnhm ) , all studies of the past are not consistent with a phase - transition at finite temperature .",
    "features in the observables , such as a peculiar finite size behaviour in the specific heat have been observed in monte - carlo simulations.@xcite we refer to this point as `` crossover - temperature '' in our manuscript .",
    "+ here we investigate the extended heisenberg model by inclusion of a next - nearest neighbor ( nnn ) coupling term .",
    "the motivation for this is three - fold : first , in real materials a small nnn coupling is expected ; second , from observing the trends towards @xmath12 new insight to the pure model might be possible ; and third , this model couples to three underlying sub - lattices which are again of kagome type ( see fig .",
    "[ knnn ] ) .",
    "this is therefore the first study of frustration which considers the coupling of two frustrated lattices which to some extent `` unfrustrate '' them as the inclusion of the @xmath0 lifts some of the degeneracies .",
    "our results show that even a very small @xmath0-term enables an anti - ferromagnetic order .",
    "this order is of @xmath13 type for af - coupling of @xmath0 , and of @xmath14 type in the other case . for the pure case ( @xmath1 ) the crossover temperature is tiny",
    "( @xmath15 ) this changes quite dramatically upon switching on the @xmath0-term ( e.g. we obtain @xmath16 for @xmath17 ) .",
    "away from @xmath1 the finite - size scaling is consistent with a phase - transition .",
    "the universality class could be classified to some extent and was found to be of the ising type for @xmath18 . for positive @xmath0 which is close to @xmath1 two peaks in the specific heat",
    "are found numerically , suggesting two phase - transitions .",
    "studying the limiting behaviour from the other side towards @xmath1 appears to be numerically harder . here",
    "the phase - transition is consistent with a first - order transition , which is apparently the reason for the numerical difficulty .",
    "from earlier work by the authors mentioned in the introduction , it was shown that the cklnnhm is very hard for a numerical investigation : the interesting temperature region is very low , and the low temperature phase is very difficult to bring into equilibrium .",
    "the extension of further neighbor interaction lift some degeneracies and therefore taking away some of the numerical `` hardness '' .",
    "our model hamiltonian reads :    @xmath19    where the @xmath20 term couples between nearest neighbor pairs ( indicated by solid lines in fig .",
    "[ knnn ] ) and the @xmath0 term between next - nearest neighbor pairs ( indicated by dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ knnn ] ) . in the following we give @xmath0 in units of @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is a classical spin operator .",
    "when @xmath1 we recover the nearest neighbor model . in this case",
    "there is a large degeneracy of coplanar and non - planar states .",
    "let us discuss the possible ground states in this case : ground states can be found by rewriting the hamiltonian from a nearest neighbor sum to a sum over all triangles @xmath22 as :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is a constant term . from this sum",
    "one realizes the condition to minimize the energy : if the sum of each individual triangle is zero , this is a minimum energy state .",
    "there are two groups of such states : the coplanar ones , where all 3 spins lie in one plane , and the non - coplanar ones , where this is not the case .",
    "we will first discuss the coplanar states and briefly mention how to obtain the non - planar ones from them .",
    "the coplanar states contain two types of antiferromagnetic sub - lattice order pattens ( see fig .",
    "[ afm12 ] thereafter afm - states ) .",
    "there is a continuous @xmath25 symmetry for these states as a simultaneous rotation of all spins in the plane keeps the energy constant . both variants of afm type states are two - fold degenerate : for the @xmath13 state ( from now on `` afm i '' state ) there is one version with only positive chiralities and one state with only negative chiralities .",
    "chirality refers to the clockwise or anti - clockwise type of rotation of spins when circumferencing an elementary triangular plaquette . for the other ( @xmath26 from now",
    "on dubbed as `` afm ii '' state - this state is usually referred to as the @xmath27 structure ) afm state there is one version with all the up - triangles having positive chirality and all the down - triangles having negative chirality and one version where the opposite is the case . for an illustration",
    "please see fig .",
    "[ afm12 ] .",
    "the above condition for minimizing the energy is not only full - filled by the two afm states , but by all states having 3 spins in one plane arranged among the plaquette with 120 degrees . starting with one sub - lattice ,",
    "the angles are fixed , but the arrangement of the 3 spins can be varied . for an arbitrary arrangement fullfilling the 120 degrees condition",
    "there is no regular patten in chiralities .",
    "one may label the 3 spins with 3 colors e.g. red , blue and green , and compose pattens where one coloured site has only nearest neighbors of another colour .",
    "all coplanar states can be constructed in such a manner .",
    "[ occ ] for illustration of a general planar state .",
    "+ taking a coplanar states as a starting point , one may use deformations leaving the energy unchanged to construct non - planar states : if e.g. we consider the two afm states of fig .",
    "[ afm12 ] there are two types of defects : the weather - vane defect for afm ii , here one rotates all inner spins of a hexagon along the common axis given by the outer spins , and a line - defect for the afm ii , where one can rotate a whole line , by the axis given by the neighbouring spins .",
    "the energy is kept constant in both cases .",
    "considering an arbirary situation ( a coloured state which is neighter afm i nor afm ii ) , one can do such operations among two coloured lines . from the above discussion",
    "one realizes that the ground state is highly degenerate and disordered .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , previous studies proposed an order - by - disorder scenario : for @xmath28 entropic selection favours coplanar states over the other states . as an order parameter originally a nematic order parameter was considered in the earlier studies .",
    "this measures the alignment of spins with respect to a common plane .",
    "the general patten of 120 degree alignment , discussed above and being an additional symmetry is not measured by such an order parameter .",
    "the octopular tensor was proposed as a better choice to measure states as the one in fig .",
    "we follow this approach .",
    "+ finally we turn to the situation with @xmath29 : in this case we bias the lowest energy state depending on the sign chosen for @xmath0 towards the two afm states ( which are still degenerate with respect to rotation and have an additional two - fold degeneracy as discussed above ) .",
    "therefore we lift most of the degeneracies .",
    "when being in one perfectly ordered afm state of one manifestation of the chirality , one needs to overcome an energy barrier to reach the other one .",
    "this is different from the situation at @xmath1 , as there the two states can be reached with formation of domain walls costing zero energy . therefore at @xmath29 there is a discrete @xmath30 symmetry for planar states .",
    "the building blocks of up and down triangles possessing + and - chiralities can therefore be understood of taking the role of ising variables .",
    "note that for planar states the situation is the same as in the xy - model on the kagome lattice being discussed in detail in ref . .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we investigated the magnetic structure factor , to see the impact of the inclusion of the @xmath0-term on this quantity .",
    "for large @xmath31 we have chosen two temperatures , one above the transition ( @xmath32 ) and one below ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "for the small @xmath31 cases we chose two more very low temperatures @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the structure for these two very low temperatures is the same , therefore we included only @xmath34 in fig .",
    "as the kagome lattice is not bi - partite , the structure factor extents over several brilouin zones . for high temperatures we observe the diffuse bow - tie structure , as in the pure kagome lattice,@xcite and as in related lattices such as",
    "the pyrochlore.@xcite the structure appears for all investigated values for @xmath0 but at different temperatures .",
    "lowering the temperature , from there we find qualitatively the same structure than for the @xmath1 case for positive sign of @xmath0 ( 3 peaks at the center of the bow - tie prevailing ) . for negative @xmath0 with the other afm ordering for the low - temperature phase , three peaks at the boundary of the triangle of the bow - tie",
    "develop , when lowering the temperature . in both cases",
    "the lowest energy plots finally show pinch points at the afm ordering vectors for the state concerned but with an increased periodicity , while at high temperature the correlations are similar to the @xmath1 case .",
    "this can be seen from our plots in fig .",
    "[ sf ] : for e.g. the tiny values of @xmath31 shown ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) at @xmath32 we are above the transition and observe the bow - tie structure , from there the pinch points develop when lowering this temperature to around @xmath38 . for larger",
    "@xmath31 the temperature @xmath32 is already within the afm phase , therefore one sees the development of the pinch points already at this temperature .",
    "this means that aside of very low temperatures the additional @xmath0 term seem not to have much impact on the correlations .",
    "to sum up , we have extended earlier work on the classical heisenberg model on the kagome lattice , by studying the inclusion of next - nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "this is relevant for real systems and a good way to gain further insight to the nearest neighbor model .",
    "we see that tiny values of @xmath0 have a big impact on this model by enabling finite - temperature phase transition , with larger transition temperature compared to the crossover point for @xmath1 .",
    "this suggests that in real materials having large spin on this lattice afm order will be observed .",
    "the nature of the phase - transition has been explored , and it was found to fit the 2-d ising universality - class for @xmath39 , and shows consistency with a first order phase transition at the negative branch close to @xmath1 . as the underlying induced symmetry is @xmath30 an ising transistion appears reasonable .",
    "how this transistion changes towards first - order might be an intersting point for future studies . for the tiny and positive @xmath0 case , two peaks in the specific heat develop , the second ( in terms of higher temperature ) most likely connecting further to the crossover point for the @xmath1 case",
    "this is an interesting point for the nearest neighbor model and a possible line of attack for future studies .",
    "we notice that the lower transition line for the positive @xmath0 branch between the afm 2 state and the disordered phase tend to @xmath40 for @xmath41 , while in the other branch the afm 1 order seems to vanish before reaching the @xmath1 point .",
    "this is consistent with earlier claims of a @xmath42 critical point for the afm 2 transition .",
    "there seem to be no qualitative impact on the spin structure factor when tuning @xmath0 .",
    "the region very close to @xmath1 remains still very interesting and should be further studied by analytic and numeric methods .",
    "+ _ acknowledgements : _ we wish to thank s. todo for advise on parapack and parallel tempering .",
