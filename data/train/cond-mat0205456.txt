    "the scaling properties of nonequilibrium - type phase transitions are a topic of intensive current research  @xcite . from the theoretical side ,",
    "focus has been mostly on model calculations using stochastic dynamics with simple local rules and local interactions .",
    "these models serve as prototypes for various physical processes , such as surface catalysis  @xcite , population growth  @xcite , surface growth  @xcite , electronic transport in wires  @xcite , traffic flow  @xcite , and avalanches in granular materials@xcite .",
    "the simplicity of the models is justifiable when , as we expect , the scale invariant collective fluctuations at large length scales are universal and insensitive to most microscopic details",
    ".    queuing phenomena , like traffic jams behind slow moving trucks on single - lane highways , are common to many nonequilibrium processes .",
    "one of the interesting phenomena in such systems is the transition from a finite queue to an infinitely long one , i.e. , the transition from a queue that does not scale with the road length @xmath3 to one whose length is proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "such transitions can be induced by changing the total density of cars in the system or by varying the probability rate at which cars pass the truck  @xcite .",
    "a simplification of the above is first to replace the slow moving truck by a stationary object , and then to ignore the excluded volume effects in the queue by allowing the cars behind this stationary impurity to pile on top of each other .",
    "this bare - bone version of the phenomenon can then be rephrased in terms of the parking garage model introduced in this paper .",
    "an asymmetric exclusion process ( aep ) on a road starting and terminating at a garage with an infinite parking capacity .",
    "the control parameters are the total number of cars , @xmath10 , in the system ( which compared to the road length @xmath3 , defines a total car density @xmath11 ) and the probability @xmath1 with which cars exit the garage ( compared to the hopping probability along the road , set equal to one ) .",
    "the infinitely long queue is represented by a macroscopic occupation of the garage .",
    "the density of parked cars , @xmath12 , is nonzero when the number of cars at the garage @xmath2 is proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "the analogy with equilibrium bose condensation is obvious as well as the basic question , i.e. , whether the scaling properties of such queuing transitions are universal .",
    "for example , how sensitive are the exponents @xmath13 and @xmath14 in @xmath15 and @xmath16 to the details of the queuing dynamics , particularly to the simplifications we made . as a start",
    ", we need to establish and understand the scaling properties of the most simplest model in as much detail as possible .",
    "the scaling properties of the parked car condensation transitions presented here are indeed already surprisingly rich .",
    "after this , we will be well positioned to restore the omitted queuing details one - by - one , and establish how robust those scaling properties are .",

    "consider a one - dimensional road of @xmath3 sites with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) .",
    "each site on this road , @xmath17 , is either empty or occupied by only one car , @xmath18 .",
    "the parking garage at site @xmath3 has no occupation upper limit , @xmath19 .",
    "the total number of cars ( @xmath10 ) in the systems is conserved .",
    "from the perspective of other physical processes , the cars can be reinterpreted just as well as , e.g. , molecules ( driven down a circular tube ) , kinks in steps on crystal surfaces , electrons driven around a wire by an electric field , or domain walls in magnetic spin chains .",
    "the stochastic update rule , from time @xmath20 to @xmath21 is sequential .",
    "one of the sites , @xmath22 , is selected at random with uniform probability @xmath23 .",
    "if that site is part of the road , @xmath24 , and occupied , the car moves forward to over one unit , presuming site @xmath25 is empty ; otherwise nothing happens .",
    "if the selected site is the one just in front of the garage , @xmath26 , and is occupied , then that car moves with certainty into the garage , irrespective of the occupation level of the garage .",
    "if the chosen site is the garage , @xmath27 , the probability for a car to jump out of it onto site @xmath28 is equal to @xmath1 , independent of the number of cars at the garage , provided that there is at least one available and site @xmath28 is empty .",
    "this exit probability from the garage is smaller than the hopping probability on the road , @xmath29 .",
    "the above process has two control parameters : the total density of cars @xmath0 and the probability @xmath1 with which cars can escape from the garage .",
    "we define the following quantities : the total car density @xmath11 , the parked car density @xmath12 , and the on - the - road density @xmath30 . only @xmath31 and @xmath32 fluctuate .",
    "the parking garage is the new aspect to this otherwise well - studied aep .",
    "the latter is exactly soluble by the bethe ansatz for periodic boundary conditions ( a closed loop road without garage )  @xcite , and the stationary state properties are exactly known for an open road with reservoirs on both sides  @xcite .",
    "we will use and comment on these different setups and exact results in the following sections .",
    "figure  [ newpd ] shows our phase diagram .",
    "it contains three phases . in two of them",
    "the garage is macroscopically occupied : the condensate ( @xmath33 ) phase ( where the garage controls the density of cars on the road ) , and the maximal current ( mc ) phase ( where the road capacity controls the flow ) . in the normal ( @xmath34 ) phase",
    ", the garage contains a finite number of parked cars ( typically only a few ) .",
    "this structure can be deduced almost completely from earlier results for aeps without the garage , such as the aep with closed periodic boundary conditions ( no garage ) , i.e. , kpz growth  @xcite , and the aep with open boundary conditions hooked - up to reservoirs on both ends  @xcite .    in the two condensate phases , @xmath33 and",
    "mc , the garage acts like a reservoir , and the model reduces to the open road version studied by derrida _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and others  @xcite . in their version ,",
    "the road is in contact with car reservoirs at both ends , @xmath28 and @xmath35 , such that a car jumps onto @xmath28 with probability @xmath1 ( if empty ) and leaves from @xmath35 with probability @xmath13 ( if occupied ) . in our model",
    "@xmath13 is always equal to one .",
    "a dynamic second - order phase transition takes place between the mc phase ( where the road density is at a constant value , @xmath36 ) and the @xmath33 phase ( where the road density @xmath37 varies with the inlet probability @xmath1 and this result is already correct within mean field theory  @xcite ) .",
    "the mc phase appears because raising the density any further would reduce the flow efficiency ( due to overcrowding ) .",
    "this phenomenon has been canonized recently into a ",
    "maximal current principle \"  @xcite , which states that the bulk road density takes the value that maximizes the flow .",
    "reduce the total number of cars inside the @xmath33 and mc phases , i.e. , walk in phase diagram towards the @xmath34 phase along a line of constant @xmath1 .",
    "this has no effect on the cars on the road and their fluctuations because all removed cars are taken from the parked ones residing inside the garage .",
    "these surplus cars are dynamically inert .",
    "this continues until the reservoir is depleted , the point at which the transition to the @xmath34 phase takes place .",
    "the road density becomes equal to the total car density @xmath38 . from the @xmath33 ( input - limited )",
    "phase perspective , this happens at @xmath39 , see fig .",
    "[ newpd ] , because @xmath37 inside the @xmath33 phase  @xcite . from the mc ( road - limited )",
    "phase perspective , it occurs at @xmath40 because @xmath36 inside mc .",
    "therefore , the phase boundaries into the @xmath34 phase are located at @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the next issue is how many types of normal phases exist in the lower right side of the phase diagram . in a @xmath34 phase ,",
    "the garage acts like a localized impurity ( a blocking - type site ) , and it contains typically only a few cars .",
    "suppose we put a cap @xmath41 on the occupation of the garage , @xmath42 .",
    "this can not affect the properties of the model in the @xmath34 phase , except very close to the transition into the condensate phases ( where the number of parked cars @xmath2 and the fluctuations in @xmath2 diverge ) .",
    "janowsky and lebowitz  @xcite ( jl ) studied such a capped version of the aep model , a closed loop road with periodic boundary conditions , without a garage , but with one special bond where the hopping probability is reduced from 1 to @xmath1 .",
    "this is equivalent to setting the occupation limit of the garage to @xmath43 .",
    "their phase diagram has the same control parameters as ours .",
    "it has particle - hole symmetry with respect to @xmath40 , see fig .",
    ". the normal phase in the lower right hand corner is similar to our model .",
    "the second normal phase in the upper right corner is equivalent to it by particle - hole symmetry , and the intermediate area is a coexistence region , the jammed phase . in the low - density @xmath34 phase ,",
    "the cars are uniformly distributed , but at @xmath44 a traffic - jam - type shock wave develops between low- and high - density @xmath34-type phase regions .",
    "this jammed phase is reminiscent of the condensate phase ( macroscopic occupation of the parking garage ) in our model .",
    "a shock wave does not appear in our model because the garage absorbs the queue .",
    "it is also clear that if we would interpolate between the jl model and our model by slowly increasing @xmath45 , the queuing transition would be delayed and would be shifting smoothly , with our @xmath34-@xmath33 phase boundary as the limiting case .",
    "jl focused on the finite - size - scaling ( fss ) properties of the fluctuations in the position of the tail of the shock wave , @xmath46 , and found @xmath47 ( except for @xmath40 where a cancellation of the leading time of flight - type fluctuations gives rise to @xmath48 )  @xcite .",
    "monitoring the location of the shock wave is analogous to observing the parked car density fluctuations in our model inside the @xmath33 and mc phases .",
    "jl did not address the scaling properties at the queuing transition itself , but their transition is definitely second order ( the location of the shock wave moves continuously with the total density away from the blockage point ) .",
    "the aep can be interpreted as a lattice representation of the burgers equation with a discretized velocity field , both in location and in its values , @xmath49 .",
    "the latter is equivalent to the so - called body - centered solid - on - solid growth model  @xcite , a lattice realization of kpz - type surface growth .",
    "each occupied site represents a down step along the one - dimentional ( 1d ) surface and every empty site an up step .",
    "the surface heights , @xmath50 , are limited to even / odd values at even / odd lattice sites , @xmath51 .",
    "the surface looks like the alternatively stacked bricks of a masonary wall , but rotated over 90 deg .",
    "each car jump to the right represents the deposition of a new vertical 1x2 brick . the average car density on the road represents the average slope of the surface .",
    "at half density the surface is not tilted .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are the most common in theoretical studies of surface growth , and this brick deposition version of kpz growth is exactly soluble by the bethe ansatz  @xcite .",
    "it is a special line in the general phase diagram of the 1d well - known _ xxz _ spin-@xmath52 quantum spin chain hamiltonian , and also in the so - called six - vertex model of 2d equilibrium critical phenomena  @xcite .    from the surface growth perspective",
    ", the open road setup with reservoirs represents an open ended 1d interface with modified particle deposition probabilities @xmath1 and @xmath13 at its end points . in the mc phase , where the car density is locked to @xmath40 ,",
    "the crystal surface maintains a net zero tilt . for @xmath53 and/or @xmath54 , the reduced growth probabilities at the edge create a nonzero globally tilted surface .",
    "moreover , along the line @xmath55 , two tilts coexist . crossing",
    "that line amounts to undergoing a first - order phase transition with different tilt angles .",
    "the lock - in transition from the @xmath33 phase into the mc phase represents a second - order dynamic facetting transition .",
    "our parking garage setup translates into a surface growth dynamics realization with periodic boundary conditions and a localized defect .",
    "the garage could represent something like a stacking defect , where the step height is unlimited ( and somehow energetically cost free ) .",
    "the cliff height at the stacking fault can be microscopic ( the @xmath34 phase ) or macroscopic ( the @xmath33 and mc phases ) .",
    "this depends on the modified growth probability @xmath1 near the defect ( on top of the cliff , somewhat similar to a schwoebel energy barrier ) and also depends on the global net tilt angle ( the total car density ) . in the mc ( @xmath33 )",
    "phase , the average slope of the surface , excluding the cliff , is zero ( nonzero ) .",
    "it is well known and easy to show that the stationary state of kpz growth with pbc , the closed loop road without obstacles where @xmath56 and @xmath57 , is completely random without any correlations whatsoever between finding a car at sites @xmath58 and @xmath59 for any @xmath60 including nearest neighbor sites . in the surface representation",
    ", this means that up and down steps are placed at random  @xcite and that the width of the interface @xmath61 scales with the random walk exponent @xmath62 .",
    "the stationary state remains uncorrelated in our model as well ( as shown below ) except near the garage .",
    "those correlations are governed by the dynamic scaling exponent and the group velocity with which fluctuations travel along the road .    in 1d kpz - type surface growth ,",
    "all characteristic times scale as @xmath63 with @xmath64 . in car language , this means that local car density fluctuations with spatial width @xmath65 broaden in time as @xmath66 . the value of the dynamic exponent @xmath67 follows from the identity @xmath68 implied by galilean invariance of the burgers equation  @xcite , together with the disordered @xmath62 nature of the stationary state .",
    "the exact ( bethe ansatz ) solution of this specific model confirms this general result .",
    "fluctuations travel with a group velocity @xmath69 to the right ( towards the garage ) along the road . from the kpz surface growth perspective",
    ", the group velocity represents the average slope of the kpz growing surface , and its fluctuations grow perpendicular to the surface orientation . from the aep formulation perspective",
    ", the value of @xmath70 is set by the average stationary state current @xmath71 ( easy to derive since the stationary state is gaussian ) and the definition of the group velocity is @xmath72 this @xmath70 played an important role , e.g. , in the aep study by majumdar and barma  @xcite of tagged - particle diffusion , and in describing phase transitions between steady states in the open road setup  @xcite .",
    "the on - the - road car density profiles in the @xmath33 and mc phases are known exactly from the open boundary model studies , in particular the one by derrida _",
    "et al . _",
    "these profiles play an important role in our later discussions and it is useful to review how the group velocity enters in qualitative explanations of these exact results .    in the road - limited @xmath73 phase at @xmath74 ,",
    "the density tail has a power - law shape , @xmath75 at both edges @xmath76=@xmath77(left),@xmath78(right ) , with @xmath79 the distance from the edge of the road ( garage entrance in our model ) and @xmath36 the on - the - road car density .",
    "in contrast , in the input - limited @xmath33 phase at @xmath53 , the car density is constant , @xmath80 , at the beginning of the road ( garage exit ) , and has an exponential tail at the end of road ( garage entrance ) , @xmath81 with the on - the - road car density @xmath37 and the correlation length @xmath82 $ ] .",
    "power laws with exponent @xmath83 arise naturally in this problem because of its critical fluctuations .",
    "the bulk properties of the kpz stationary state are invariant under a rescaling of all lengths as @xmath84 , all times as @xmath85 , and the surface heights as @xmath86 .",
    "the car density scales , therefore , naively as @xmath87 .",
    "this means that power - law tails in the density distribution near the edge of the road , with exponent @xmath88 , like in eq .",
    "( [ density ] ) , are to be expected .    on the other hand , the disordered nature of the stationary state suggests exponential profiles , like in eq .",
    "( [ density - exp ] ) . indeed , in the bulk",
    ", the stationary state density - density correlation function @xmath89 does not decay as a @xmath90 power law as may be suggested by the above scaling argument , but instead decays exponentially with a very short correlation length , that is zero in this specific model since the cars on the road are totally uncorrelated in the stationary state .    to make sense of eqs .",
    "( [ density ] ) and ( [ density - exp ] ) , it is important to realize that the density profile near the edge of the road incorporates temporal correlations , and also to appreciate the role of the group velocity .",
    "the power - law profile in the mc phase is the result of correlations with cars that reached the edge of the road and moved into the garage at earlier times .",
    "such correlations spread in time over a spatial distance @xmath66 .",
    "the group velocity is zero in the mc phase and therefore the cars at a distance @xmath65 from the edge of the road are ( power - law ) correlated with those that entered the garage at times earlier than @xmath91 .",
    "they have no knowledge about cars arriving at the garage more recently .",
    "this explains the power - law tail in the density distribution .    in the @xmath33 phase , the same correlation spreading takes place within a moving frame of reference with nonzero group velocity .",
    "information reaches the edge of the road ( garage entrance ) at a rate @xmath70 ( linear in time ) faster than it can spread backwards as @xmath66 ( since @xmath92 ) .",
    "memory has no opportunity to develop near the edge of the road , and the density profile adjusts itself at the road end as if the cars on the road are completely uncorrelated .",
    "the exponential tail reflects a suction - type effect ; the excluded volume limitation on the car mobility does not act on the cars departing from the road .",
    "similarly , in the mc phase , power - law correlations with earlier cars that escaped from the garage and entered the road give rise to a power - law tail in the density profile at the beginning of the road ( near the exit of the garage ) , while in the @xmath33 phase , this information travels faster away from the road start than it can spread backwards .",
    "so , new cars entering the road do so completely uncorrelated , resulting in no road - start tail in the profile whatsoever .",
    "this confirms why the mc phase is road limited and the @xmath33 phase is input limited . in the latter , the car supply at the garage controls the density near the edge of the road and also everywhere else on the road .",
    "in the @xmath34 phase , we find numerically , from monte carlo simulations , an exponential tail at the road end and an @xmath93 tail at the road start as shown in fig .",
    "the group velocity is also nonzero in the @xmath34 phase , which explains the exponential exit tail as follows . just like in the @xmath33 phase ,",
    "the garage is invisible to the incoming of cars from the road ; fluctuations arrive at the garage faster ( at constant velocity ) than they can spread backwards ( with @xmath94 ) .",
    "the fact that in the @xmath34 phase only a few cars reside inside the garage is invisible to the cars entering the garage .",
    "an @xmath93 tail at the beginning of the road is what one expects from the deterministic part of the burgers equation .",
    "the solution of the deterministic burgers equation , @xmath95 with the velocity @xmath96 pinned at a specific nonzero value at site @xmath97 , is readily seen ( e.g. , in the hopf transformed formulation ) to be of the generic form @xmath98 , i.e. , having the @xmath93 power - law shape .    in the @xmath33 phase ,",
    "the system selects the value @xmath99 for the constant , and in the @xmath34 phase , @xmath100 . in both cases , the group velocity @xmath101 carries away kpz fluctuations faster than they can spread , such that the kpz noise term can be ignored at the road start ( stationary frame of reference ) .",
    "the only noise that remains is that from the random process by which cars are being taken out of the garage and put on the road . in the @xmath33 phase ,",
    "the supply of cars is bottomless ( @xmath102 ) , such that @xmath99 ( the entire on the on - the - road bulk car density is ruled by the garage ) , while , in the @xmath34 phase , the supply of cars is limited and the garage does not overwhelm the road , such that @xmath100 .",
    "it is useful to discuss how the group velocity affects the car - car correlation function , @xmath103 according to scaling theory , it obeys the form @xmath104 in the limit @xmath105 , the scaling function @xmath106 must approach a constant since the autocorrelation decays as a power law , @xmath107 with @xmath62 . in the opposite limit , of large @xmath108",
    ", the scaling function must decay exponentially because @xmath109 due to the random nature of the stationary state ( or , more generically , it decays exponentially with some correlation range @xmath110 of the same order as the interaction range between cars ) .",
    "the above scaling relation suggests the form @xmath111 in the limit @xmath112 , such that @xmath113 with @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the length @xmath65 in the exponential defines the  correlation cone \" that we already mentioned above . within the cone",
    "the correlations decay as a power law , and outside it the cars are uncorrelated ( as in the stationary state ) .",
    "the above discussion ignores finite - size effects . for open road or garage type boundary conditions ,",
    "the correlator explicitly depends on the initial position @xmath116 of the car at time @xmath117 and also on the road length @xmath3 , @xmath118    finite - size effects set in at times when the correlation cones hit the road edges , @xmath119 or @xmath120 . at times longer than @xmath121 , we therefore expect that the car - car correlator decays exponentially , e.g. , as @xmath122 the above analysis applies to the mc phase , where the drift ( group ) velocity is zero . in the @xmath33 phase ( and also the @xmath34 phase ) , we need to switch to the moving frame of reference by replacing @xmath123 .",
    "this has some peculiar consequences .",
    "for example , the autocorrelation function @xmath124 decays exponentially in time ( even at short times ) .",
    "the correlation cone @xmath65 is slanted in the direction of the flow ( the correlations move with the flow ) and @xmath65 widens slower than linear in time , such that the @xmath125 line in the world sheet lies outside the correlation cone .",
    "the kpz - type correlations are somewhat hidden . in order to expose them",
    ", one needs to plot them in some special manner , e.g. , @xmath126 ( the autocorrelator in the moving frame of reference ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ plot_g ] .",
    "let us turn now to the scaling properties of the two condensate phase transitions from the @xmath33 and mc phases into the @xmath34 phase .",
    "the stationary state value of the parked car density @xmath12 acts as the order parameter .",
    "we expect it to obey the fss relation @xmath127 near the two condensation transition lines with a scaling factor @xmath128 , and @xmath129 , a measure of the distance from the transition .    in the @xmath34 phase ,",
    "the density of parked cars is zero , @xmath130 .",
    "when approached from the @xmath33 and mc sides , @xmath31 goes to zero as latexmath:[$\\rho_p\\sim     removal of cars from the road is accommodated by taking them from the passive inert ones residing inside the garage .",
    "this implies that @xmath31 must vanishes linearly at the transition , and that @xmath132 .",
    "our numerical simulations confirm that @xmath133 , as @xmath7 in figs .",
    "[ y_cn ] and [ y_nmc ] .",
    "the total number of parked cars ( @xmath2 ) scales as @xmath134 with exponent @xmath135 according to eq .",
    "( [ nscaling ] ) and @xmath136 . in the @xmath34 phase ,",
    "the density @xmath31 remains zero , while the total number of parked cars ( @xmath2 ) diverges towards the transition as @xmath137 .",
    "we find numerically that this power law is linear as well , @xmath138 .",
    "combined with the linear scaling of the car density from the @xmath33 or mc side ( implying @xmath139 ) , this yields @xmath140 .",
    "the exponent @xmath141 determines the fss behavior of the total number of parked cars at the transition point itself , @xmath4 ( and also that the density of parked cars vanishes as @xmath142 ) .",
    "figure  [ y_cn ] shows the numerical results of @xmath141 and @xmath13 at point @xmath143 of the @xmath33-@xmath34 phase boundary and fig .",
    "[ y_nmc ] at @xmath56 ( and 0.75 ) of the mc-@xmath34 phase boundary .",
    "notice that the fss corrections in the exponent @xmath141 are much stronger at the mc-@xmath34 transition than at the @xmath33-@xmath34 transition .",
    "the validity of the scaling relations is further illustrated by plotting the scaling function @xmath144 in the following form @xmath145 and the associated data collapse while moving through the transition points at constant @xmath0 and constant @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the curves in fig .",
    "[ collapse ] collapse very well .",
    "the fluctuations and the fss corrections to the number of parked cars are a mirror of the density - density correlations and the density profile of cars on the road .",
    "they also reflect how the latter builds up as a function of the length of the road . at the transition points ,",
    "the bulk value of the on - the - road density @xmath146 is exactly equal to the total number of cars in the system divided by the road length , @xmath147 , such that there would be no need for any car to remain inside the garage .",
    "we find numerically that at the @xmath33-@xmath34 transition point , the density profile retains the same structure as inside the @xmath33 phase ; with no tail at the beginning of the road ( garage exit ) and an exponential tail at the end of the road ( garage entrance ) .",
    "such profiles can not account for the @xmath148 fss divergence in the number of parked cars .",
    "the scaling behavior @xmath4 must , therefore , reflect directly the corrections to fss in the bulk density of cars on the road .",
    "the value @xmath149 naturally arises because at the transition point , @xmath150 , and @xmath151 scales as @xmath152 , where @xmath77 corresponds to a given length of the road @xmath3 .",
    "a more intuitive explanation follows again from the nonzero group velocity at the @xmath33-@xmath34 phase boundary .",
    "as mentioned above in the discussion of the density distribution tail in the @xmath33 phase , the events by which cars enter the road from the garage are completely uncorrelated due to the slanting of the correlation cones ( the correlations move with the flow towards the garage and spread slower than linearly , only as @xmath66 , such that communications with later events at the beginning of the road are impossible ) .",
    "so the entry events to the road from the garage behave like uncorrelated random noise , and the fluctuations in the number of cars scale , therefore , as the square root of time . the time in question is proportional to @xmath3 because the fluctuations ( created at the garage exit ) move along the road with velocity @xmath70 , and are wiped out after they return to the garage . from this , it follows that the fluctuations in the number of parked cars scales as @xmath153 .",
    "moreover , @xmath2 can not be negative , which means that the fluctuations sample the bottom of the garage and that the transition from the @xmath33 to @xmath34 phase , therefore , takes place when the garage contains @xmath154 cars .    in summary",
    ", the scaling at the @xmath33-@xmath34 phase boundary is governed by the bulk fluctuations in the - on - the - road density , which is ruled by the nonzero group velocity of kpz fluctuations , and this leads directly to random noise like @xmath154 , corrections to fss .",
    "the fss corrections to scaling in exponent @xmath14 ( @xmath141 ) at the mc-@xmath34 phase boundary are much more complex .",
    "the ( bulk ) group velocity is zero , and power - law density profiles are realized at both edges of the road . at the end of the road",
    ", the density profile follows a critical exponent @xmath83 , the same power as that inside the mc phase discussed in sec .",
    "[ densityprofile ]",
    ". however , at the road start ( the exit of the garage ) , the power - law exponent changes from @xmath83 inside the mc phase to @xmath155 at the mc-@xmath34 transition .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ nmcnu ] for @xmath56 and @xmath40 , where the effect is the strongest .",
    "the @xmath156 power law does not change the @xmath157 fss behavior of the number of parked cars .",

    "[ y_nmc](a ) .",
    "the @xmath155 power - law profile contributes only a subdominant term to @xmath31 because it decays faster than the two @xmath83 contributions ( from the density profile at the end of the road and from the kpz - like bulk road density fluctuations ) .",
    "we have not achieved yet a good understanding of this novel value , @xmath156 , for the exponent of the density profile at the beginning of the road .",
    "it obviously lies correctly in between the mc and @xmath34 values , @xmath52 and @xmath158 , respectively",
    ". moreover , its value , @xmath155 , is likely linked to the kpz dynamic exponent @xmath159 .",
    "but it remains unclear how to glue the following pieces together .    at the mc-@xmath34 transition ,",
    "the group velocity of the fluctuations , @xmath69 , is still zero ( but only barely ) since @xmath36 .",
    "this means that time of flight aspects , which dominate the @xmath33 and @xmath34 phases , do not come into play .",
    "near the garage , the tail in the density profile , @xmath160 , creates a local nonzero group velocity @xmath161 pointing back into the garage ( instead of away from it as in the @xmath33 and @xmath34 phases ) .    recall from sec .",
    "[ densityprofile ] that the density profile in the mc phase has the same type of power - law profile @xmath162 , but with the  kpz \" ( power - counting ) exponent value @xmath83 . in that case , fluctuations at the road start do not reach the bulk of the road : the leading edge of the information cone is stationary because the backward movement of its center of mass @xmath163 ( implied by @xmath164 ) matches exactly the rate of its spreading , @xmath165 .",
    "so the @xmath83 density profile fully screens the garage from view in the bulk of the road .",
    "exactly the same screening of the information takes place at the end of the road ( garage entrance ) since also there the mc phase density profile has exponent @xmath83 ( but in an opposite forward moving @xmath70 sense and with a negative density profile amplitude ) .    the density profile exponent @xmath155 at the mc-@xmath34 transition does not fully screen the garage any more from observers located far away on the road .",
    "total screening is not needed because kpz fluctuations start to tunnel through the garage since it has only a @xmath153 occupation .",
    "it is yet unclear to us , however , how to deduce ( in a convincing manner ) the exponent @xmath155 from these considerations .",
    "in this section , we explore the fluctuations in the parked car density and also car - car correlations on the road . of particular interest is the onset of transmission of information through the garage at the phase transitions . in the two condensate phases , the garage acts as a car reservoir and as a sink of fluctuations , while in the normal phase it contains only a few cars and transmits fluctuations .    the temporal fluctuations in the total number of parked cars , @xmath166 , measures also the fluctuations in the total number of cars on the road .",

    "the density - density correlations spread just like in the mc phase , but only with respect to the moving frame of reference and with @xmath170 replaced by @xmath191 .",

    "the fluctuations in the total number of cars on the road , @xmath200 , are not proportional to @xmath3 but are only of order one .",

    ", it behaves very much the same , except that the positive density fluctuation creates a deficit inside the garage since the number of cars in the garage is finite , such that fewer cars can be put on the road in the immediate wake of the positive fluctuation .",
    "therefore , in the @xmath34 phase , every positive fluctuation carries a compensating ( again localized ) negative tail with it .",
    "figure  [ soliton ] illustrates the difference schematically , and our numerical simulations confirm this picture .",
    "one could say that in the @xmath34 phase positive and negative local excitations are bound in pairs , and that they unbind at the @xmath34-@xmath33 transition . on approach of the transition from the @xmath34 side ,",
    "the width of the negative tail grows , but with conserved total area ( equal to the area of the positive part of the excitation ) , because the average number of cars in the garage increases towards the transition ( and diverges ) and therefore the reduced car output is being spread over more time . at the transition point itself , the negative tail has vanished , except for the finite - size scaling effect of order @xmath209 .",
    "local excitations , thus , behave quite interestingly .",
    "however , they do not explain the difference in the behavior of @xmath171 at the transition point and in the @xmath33 phase .",
    "these solitary waves do not deplete the garage sufficiently to trigger its bottom because at the transition point the number of parked cars still diverges as @xmath210 .",
    "only nonlocal excitations , which encompass the entire system , are able to empty out the garage .",
    "consider an excitation where the density of cars is globally and uniformly enhanced along the entire road , @xmath211 .",
    "this requires that the number of cars to be taken out of the garage should be proportional to the road length @xmath3 . in the @xmath33 phase",
    ", those will not deplete the garage because the number of parked cars is also proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "such a @xmath212 regiment of extra cars marches with group velocity @xmath70 to the right , reaches the end of the road , and thus returns to the garage at a rate uniformly in time , row by row . throughout this process , the garage is not aware of the existence of the regiment since we did not hit its bottom and because the information cones @xmath179 on the road do not broaden fast enough compared to the group velocity to maintain its memory at the garage exit .",
    "this implies that the exact stationary state rebuilds itself in the wake of the regiment , and also that the enhanced road density decays linearly in time and vanishes completely after one time of flight @xmath198 , just like our @xmath171 as a function of time @xmath196 .    at the transition point , the garage only contains @xmath154 cars , so that the same type of global uniform excitation can only have an amplitude of order @xmath209 , and always depletes the garage .",
    "this regiment of cars travels to the right with velocity @xmath70 , just like in the @xmath33 phase , but in its wake the garage can not rebuild the stationary state because it is empty .",
    "a depleted road density is established in the wake of the enhanced excitation , and thus anticorrelations build up , and after one time of flight the average density of cars on the road is below normal ( and a surplus of cars resides in the garage ) .",
    "this explains qualitatively the oscillatory behavior of @xmath171 at the transition point and the anticorrelations at @xmath198 .",
    "the correlations at the mc-@xmath34 transition are less spectacular than at the @xmath33-@xmath34 transition .",
    "the group velocity is zero inside the mc phase , and still remains zero at the mc-@xmath34 transition . only inside the @xmath34 phase ,",
    "does it start to shift continuously away from zero .",
    "figure  [ g_nmc ] shows how @xmath171 scales at the @xmath213 transition .",
    "these numerical results are almost the same as those inside the mc phase in fig .",

    "( [ timezero ] ) represents the number of cars on the road ( the number of sites @xmath116 that are occupied ) .",
    "this should be modified to @xmath215 , since the number of parked cars scales as @xmath153 .",
    "the other terms , the spreading in time of the correlation cones and the autocorrelations on the road , are likely unchanged .",
    "such differences are subtle and not surprisingly numerically invisible .",
    "in this paper , we presented the scaling properties of dynamic condensate phase transitions in terms of an 1d asymmetric exclusion process with a parking garage .",
    "there are two types of condensate phases : the maximal current ( mc ) phase , where the road controls the density of cars on the road , and the condensate ( @xmath33 ) phase , where the garage ( as a reservoir ) controls the number of cars on the road .",
    "the existence of a group velocity is crucial for understanding the behaviors of correlations and the density profiles in these two phases and at the phase transitions .    at both condensate transitions , the number of parked cars scales as @xmath4 with @xmath148 , while on approach of the transition",
    ", the density of parked cars vanishes linearly with the control parameters ( the total density of cars in the system and the exit probability from the garage ) @xmath216 , with @xmath7 .",
    "also , the transition points represent the onset of communication of information through the garage .",
    "this leads to interesting autocorrelations in the number of parked cars , particularly at the @xmath33-@xmath34 transition , due to the nonzero group velocity and associated time - of - flight effects .",
    "our parking garage model is a bare - bone version of dynamic bose condensation and of queuing phenomena , like traffic jams .",
    "the fundamental issue that needs further study is whether the above scaling behavior , in particular the values of the critical exponents , are universal or not .",
    "how do more realistic interactions between the cars on the road change this ? do the simplifications in the traffic jams , like a stationary truck versus a moving one and ignoring the spatial structure inside the queue of cars behind it by collapsing them ( piling them up ) into a  garage , \" affect the exponents ?",
    "there is some evidence suggesting that the exponents are indeed robust , e.g. , in the janowsky and lebowitz  @xcite model , the same simple kpz - type values of the exponents appear in the fluctuations of the queue , although a detailed study of the queuing transition itself needs still to be performed .",
    "in addition , introducing short - range car - car interactions  @xcite do not seem to change the exponents either  @xcite .",
