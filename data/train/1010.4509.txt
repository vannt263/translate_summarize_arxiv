    "top quark is an interesting particle in the standard model ( sm ) because of its large mass .",
    "it may play a special role in the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "its properties such as mass  @xcite , lifetime  @xcite , spin , couplings to other particles and production mechanism deserve to be studied precisely .",
    "the hadronic production of the single top production provides an important opportunity to study the charged weak current interactions of the top quark , e.g. , the structure of the the @xmath2 vertex  @xcite . besides , it is a background for many new physics processes .",
    "however , due to the difficulties to discriminate its signatures from the large background , it is only recently that d0  @xcite and cdf  @xcite collaborations have observed the single top production at the tevatron .    in the three main production modes of the top quark ,",
    "the t - channel is specially important because of its largest cross section , which has been extremely studied , including the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections in  @xcite .",
    "their results show that the nlo corrections are about @xmath3 and @xmath4 at the lhc and tevatron , respectively .",
    "also , parton shower monte carlo simulation was considered in  @xcite .",
    "threshold resummation for this process was calculated in  @xcite , where only large soft and collinear gluon corrections were resummed and the resummed cross section was expanded up to @xmath5 .    in this paper",
    ", we use the framework of soft - collinear effective theory ( scet )  @xcite to give a resummed cross section of t - channel single top production , which contains all contributions from large logarithms in hard , jet and soft functions to all orders .",
    "there is a strong motivation for performing this calculation because the hard functions of this process , compared with soft functions , is not small , but refs .",
    "@xcite only resum the soft and jet effects to next - to - next - to - leading logarithmic ( nnll ) order , using the traditional method , and leave the hard effects unresummed . in the scet approach , the different scales in a process can be separated because the soft and collinear degrees can be decoupled by the redefinition of the fields . at each scale , we only need to deal with the relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "their dependencies on the scale are controlled by the renormalization group ( rg ) equations , and the hard , jet and soft effects can be resummed conveniently .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ] ,",
    "we give the factorization and resummation formalism of this process in momentum space . in section  [ sec:3 ] , each factor in the resummed cross section is calculated . in section  [ sec:4 ] ,",
    "we present the numerical results for this process at the tevatron and lhc , respectively .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec:5 ] .",
    "following the same factorization formalism as in our previous paper  @xcite , the partonic differential cross section of t - channel can be written as @xmath6 with @xmath7 at the nlo accuracy . in scet",
    ", there is a rg evolution factor connecting the hard scale @xmath8 and the final common scale @xmath9 , which would contain contributions from non - diagonal elements in its anomalous dimension matrix .",
    "however , these contributions are so small , as we saw in ref .",
    "@xcite , that we can neglect them .",
    "therefore , we can consider this channel as a double deep - inelastic - scattering ( ddis ) process  @xcite and assume that the hard function @xmath10 can be factorized into two parts , i.e.  @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which represent corrections from the up fermion line and down fermion line in the feynman diagram  [ fig : born ] , respectively . and",

    "at the nnll accuracy , we need the explicit expressions of hard , jet and soft functions up to nlo in perturbation theory . in this section , we show the calculations of them .",
    "the hard functions are the absolute square of the wilson coefficients of the operators , which can be obtained by matching the full theory onto scet . in practice , we need to calculate the one - loop on - shell feynman diagrams of this process in both the full theory and scet .",
    "in dimensional regularization(dr ) , the facts that the ir structure of the full theory and the effective theory is identical and the on - shell integrals are scaleless and vanish in scet imply that the ir divergence of the full theory is just the negative of the uv divergence of scet . after calculating the one - loop on - shell feynman diagrams , we get the hard functions at nlo are as follows : @xmath14 with @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
