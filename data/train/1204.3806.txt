    "to understand the nature and origins of mass opinion formation is the outstanding challenge of democratic societies @xcite . in a last few years an enormous development of such social networks as livejournal @xcite , facebook @xcite , twitter @xcite and",
    "vkontakte @xcite , with up to hundreds of millions of users , demonstrated the growing influence of these networks on social and political life .",
    "the small - world scale - free structure of the social networks ( see e.g. @xcite ) , combined with their rapid communication facilities , leads to a very fast information propagation over networks of electors , consumers , citizens making them very active on instantaneous social events .",
    "this puts forward a request for new theoretical models which would allow to understand the opinion formation process in the modern society of xxi century .",

    ", we analyze the opinion formation on real directed networks taken from the academic web link database of british universities networks @xcite , livejournal database @xcite and twitter dataset @xcite .",
    "this allows us to incorporate the correct scale - free network structure instead of unrealistic regular lattice networks , often considered in voter models @xcite . at second , we assume that the opinion at a given node is formed by the opinions of its linked neighbors weighted with the pagerank probability of these network nodes . we think that this step represents the reality of social networks : all of network nodes are characterized by the pagerank vector which gives a probability to find a random surfer on a given node as described in @xcite .",
    "this vector gives a steady - state probability distribution on the network which provides a natural ranking of node importance , or elector or society member importance . in a certain sense",
    "the top nodes of pagerank correspond to a political elite of the social network which opinion influences the opinions of other members of the society @xcite .",
    "thus the proposed pagerank opinion formation ( prof ) model takes into account the situation in which an opinion of an influential friend from high ranks of the society counts more than an opinion of a friend from lower society level .",
    "we argue that the pagerank probability is the most natural form of ranking of society members .",
    "indeed , the efficiency of pagerank rating is demonstrated for various types of scale - free networks including the world wide web ( www ) @xcite , _ physical review _",
    "citation network @xcite , scientific journal rating @xcite , ranking of tennis players @xcite , wikipedia articles @xcite , the world trade network @xcite and others . due to the above argument we consider that the prof model captures the reality of social networks and below we present the analysis of its interesting properties .",

    "we find rather similar properties of opinion formation .",
    "it is characterized by the important feature according to which the society elite with a fixed opinion can impose it to a significant fraction of the society members which is much larger than the initial elite fraction . however ,",
    "when the initial opinions of society members , including the elite , are presented by two options then we find a significant range of opinion fraction within a bistability regime .",
    "this range depends on the conformist parameter which characterizes the local aspects of opinion formation of linked society members .",
    "the generalization of the sznajd model for the scale - free social networks gives interesting examples of opinion formation where finite small size groups can keep their own opinion being different from the main opinion of the majority . in this way",
    "the proposed prof - sznajd model shows that the totalitar opinions can be escaped by small sub - communities .",
    "we find that the properties of opinion formation are rather similar for the two university networks of cambridge and oxford .",
    "however , the results obtained for networks of livejournal and twitter show that the range of bistability practically disappears for these networks .",
    "our data indicate that this is related to a slower algebraic decay of pagerank in these cases compared to the university networks .",
    "however , the deep reasons of such a difference require a more detailed analysis .",
    "indeed , livejournal and twitter networks demonstrate rather different behavior for the @xmath150-weighted function of opinion formation .",
    "the studies performed for regular networks @xcite show existence of stable or bistable fixed points for opinion formation models that have certain similarities with the opinion formation properties found in our studies . at the same time the results obtained in @xcite",
    "show that three - body spin coupling can generate a chaotic renormalization dynamics . some our results ( fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] , right panel ) give indications on a possible existence of such chaotic phase on the social networks .",
    "the enormous development of social networks in a few last years @xcite definitely shows that the analysis of opinion formation on such networks requires further investigations .",
    "this research can find also various other applications .",
    "one of them can be a neuronal network of brain which represents itself a directed scale - free network @xcite .",
    "the applications of network science to brain networks is now under a rapid development ( see e.g. @xcite ) and the google matrix methods can find useful applications in this field @xcite .    this work is supported in part by the ec fet open project `` new tools and algorithms for directed network analysis '' ( nadine @xmath174 288956 ) .",
