    "the discovery of a higgs - like resonance near 125 gev @xcite at the lhc is a great triumph for theoretical and experimental particle physics . so far",
    ", most measurements of this new particle are consistent with the standard model ( sm ) prediction , but the experimental investigation of this new particle has only just begun .",
    "it is not impossible that more in - depth studies will reveal its non - sm properties .",
    "compared with the normal decay modes , the flavour - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) decays are highly suppressed in the sm due to the glashow - iliopoulos - maiani ( gim ) mechanism@xcite .",
    "so , any large enhancements in these branching ratios will be smoking - gun signals beyond the sm .    as the heaviest known elementary particle , the top quark",
    "is widely speculated to be sensitive to the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) mechanism and new physics at tev - scale .",
    "an interesting possibility is the presence of fcnc interactions between the higgs boson and the top quark .",
    "this interaction not only participate in the top quark fcnc decays@xcite , but also participate in the higgs fcnc decays@xcite .    except for the dominant decay mode @xmath2 ,",
    "the so called below - threshold decay modes induced by the @xmath3 couplings are also very important , where the decay @xmath4 with one ( or two ) v s being off - shell and decaying to fermions . in some new physics , the decay mode of higgs bosons is much richer and 3-body decays may be even more important .",
    "now , almost all higgs boson decay modes have been measured at the lhc , but they are plagued by large sm backgrounds .",
    "so , the rare higgs 3-body decays may bring us more surprises .",
    "in some new physics models , the gim suppression can be relaxed and/or new particles can contribute to the loops , so that the top - higgs fcnc couplings @xmath5 , especially the @xmath6 coupling , can be enhanced by orders of magnitude larger than those of the sm@xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we study the rare higgs 3-body decay @xmath7 induced by top - higgs fcnc coupling in the littlest higgs model with t - parity(lht ) .",
    "this decay includes the fcnc vertex @xmath6 , which receives the contribution from the new t - odd gauge bosons and t - odd fermions .",
    "the results of this process will help to test the sm and probe the lht model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we give a brief review of the lht model related to our work .",
    "in secs.iii we calculate the rare higgs 3-body decay @xmath0 induced by top - higgs fcnc coupling in unitary gauge under current constraints .",
    "finally , we draw our conclusions in sec.iv .",
    "the lht model is based on an @xmath8 non - linear @xmath9 model@xcite . at the scale @xmath10 ( tev ) ,",
    "the @xmath11 global symmetry is broken down to @xmath12 by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the @xmath9 field , @xmath13 , given by @xmath14 after the global symmetry is broken , there arise 14 goldstone bosons(gb ) which are described by the `` pion '' matrix @xmath15 .",
    "then the kinetic term for the gb matrix can be expressed in the standard non - linear sigma model formalism as @xmath16    the @xmath9 field kinetic lagrangian is given by @xmath17 with the @xmath18 ^ 2 $ ] covariant derivative defined by @xmath19,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the heavy @xmath22 and @xmath23 gauge bosons , with @xmath24 and @xmath25 the gauge generators , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the respective gauge couplings .",
    "the vev @xmath13 also breaks the gauged subgroup @xmath28 ^ 2 $ ] of the @xmath11 down to the sm electroweak @xmath29 . at @xmath30 in the expansion of the lagrangian ( [ kinlag ] ) , the masses of the t - parity partners of the @xmath31 boson ( @xmath32 ) , @xmath33 boson ( @xmath34 ) and photon ( @xmath35 ) after ewsb are given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 denote the sm @xmath22 and @xmath23 gauge couplings , respectively .",
    "@xmath39 represents the vev of the higgs doublet , which is related to the sm higgs vev @xmath40gev through the following formula : @xmath41    in the quark sector , the t - odd mirror partners for each sm quark are added to preserve the t - parity .",
    "the up and down - type mirror quarks can be denoted by @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where @xmath44(@xmath45 ) is the generation index .",
    "one can write down a yukawa interaction to give masses to the mirror quarks @xmath46 after the ewsb , their masses up to @xmath30 are given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 are the eigenvalues of the mass matrix @xmath49 .    under t -parity , in order to cancel the large radiative correction",
    "to higgs mass parameter induced by top quark , an additional t - even heavy quark @xmath50 and its t - odd mirror partner @xmath51 are introduced .",
    "their masses are given by @xmath52\\\\ m_{t^{-}}&=&\\frac{f}{v}\\frac{m_{t}}{\\sqrt{x_{l}}}[1+\\frac{v^{2}}{f^{2}}(\\frac{1}{3}-\\frac{1}{2}x_{l}(1-x_{l}))]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the mixing parameter between the top - quark and heavy quark @xmath50 .",
    "this mixing parameter can also be expressed by a ratio @xmath54 with @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are two dimensionless top quark yukawa couplings .",
    "when the mass matrix @xmath58 is diagonalized by two @xmath59 matrices , a new flavor structure can come from the mirror fermions . in the mirror quark sector , the existence of two ckm - like unitary mixing matrices @xmath60 and @xmath61 is one of the important ingredients .",
    "it s worth noting that @xmath60 and @xmath61 are related through the sm ckm matrix : @xmath62    follow ref.@xcite , the matrix @xmath61 can be parameterized with three angles @xmath63 and three phases @xmath64 @xmath65    for the down - type quarks and charged leptons , there are two possible ways to construct the yukawa interaction , which are denoted as case a and case b@xcite . at order @xmath66 , the corresponding corrections to the higgs couplings",
    "are given by ( @xmath67 ) @xmath68",
    "the feynman diagrams of the tree level @xmath69 and the rare decay @xmath69 are shown respectively in fig.[hwbc2 ] and fig.[hwbc ] , which includes the @xmath70 and @xmath71 modes .",
    "the rare higgs decay @xmath7 is mediated by the same yukawa coupling that leads to the @xmath72 decay@xcite , so we show the feynman diagrams of the lht one - loop correction to vertex @xmath73 in unitary gauge in fig.[tch ] , where the goldstone bosons do not appear .",
    "we can see that the flavor changing interactions between sm quarks and mirror quarks are mediated by the heavy gauge bosons @xmath74 .",
    "we find that dominant contribution to the branching ratio of the decay @xmath0 is from the interference between the fig.[hwbc2 ] and fig.[hwbc ] .",
    "each loop diagram is composed of some scalar loop functions @xcite , which are calculated by using looptools@xcite .    in our numerical calculations , we take the sm parameters as follows@xcite @xmath75    the lht parameters related to our calculations are the scale @xmath76 , the mixing parameter @xmath53 , the yukawa couplings @xmath48 of the mirror quarks and the parameters in the matrices @xmath77 . due to the weak influence of the mixing parameter @xmath53 , we take @xmath78 for an example in our calculations . for the mirror quark masses ,",
    "we get @xmath79 at @xmath80 and further assume @xmath81 for the yukawa couplings , the search for the mono - jet events at the lhc run-1@xcite give the constraint @xmath82 .",
    "considering the constraints in ref.@xcite , we scan over the free parameters @xmath76 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 within the following region @xmath85 for the parameters in the matrices @xmath77 , we follow ref.@xcite to consider the two scenarios as follows    * scenario i : @xmath86,@xmath87 ; * scenario ii : @xmath88 .    furthermore , we will consider the constraint from the global fit of the current higgs data and the electroweak precision observables ( ewpos)@xcite .",
    "in fig.[fkab ] , we present the excluded regions by the global fit of the higgs data , ewpos and @xmath89 in the @xmath90 plane of the lht model for case a and case b , where the parameter @xmath91 is marginalized over . in this global fit , the three generation yukawa couplings @xmath92 are considered to be degenerate , which will give a stronger constrain than the nondegenerate case here .    in fig.[fkcase12 ] , we show the branching ratios of @xmath7 in the @xmath93 plane for two scenarios with excluded regions of case a and case b , where the @xmath70 and @xmath71 modes have been summed . from the left panel of fig.4",
    ", we can see that the branching ratio of @xmath0 in scenario i can reach @xmath94 at @xmath95 level for case a. this branching ratio will become larger under the constrain of case b. from the right panel of fig.[fkcase12 ] , we can see that the branching ratio of @xmath0 in scenario ii can reach @xmath96 at @xmath95 level , which is three even four times larger than that in scenario i. comparing the two scenarios , we can find that the enhanced effects come from the large departures from the sm caused by the mixing matrice in scenario ii .",
    "from the two panels of fig.[fkcase12 ] , we can see that the large branching ratios mainly lie in the upper - left and lower - left corners of the contour figures , where the scale @xmath76 is small and the yukawa coupling @xmath84 is either too small or too large .    according to the ref.@xcite",
    ", the branching ratio of @xmath72 is enhanced by the mass splitting between the three generation mirror quarks , the same thing will happen to the branching ratios of @xmath0 . in order to see this dependence",
    ", we show the branching ratios of @xmath0 in the @xmath97 plane for two scenarios in fig.[case12 ] , respectively .",
    "we can see that the small branching ratios correspond to the region that has small mass splitting @xmath98 values .",
    "the largest branching ratios lie in the upper - left corners of the contour figure with small @xmath76 and @xmath98 of @xmath99 tev rather than the regions that have the largest @xmath100 , that is because the branching ratios are suppressed by the high scale @xmath76 .    for the observability",
    ", the sm decay @xmath101 is an important irreducible background that will generate the same final state . due to the off - shell top in the signal decay @xmath102",
    ", we can use the invariant masses cut @xmath103 gev to isolate the signal . besides , the @xmath104-jet in our signal comes from the higgs decay , which usually is harder than that in the sm background @xmath105 .",
    "thus , we can use the high transverse momentum @xmath106 cut to suppress the background .",
    "due to the same yukawa couplings that lead to the @xmath72 decays , the decays @xmath102 can be indirectly constrained by atlas and cms searches@xcite : br@xmath107 , where the @xmath70 and @xmath71 modes have been summed over . at the lhc , the @xmath108 background is undoubtedly a challenge , which will complicate the analysis for detecting the decay @xmath102 .",
    "given this , the linear collider with clean background may be an ideal place for investigating this process , for example a future muon collider could test the fcnc decay @xmath72 via higgs decay @xmath109 down to values of br@xmath110@xcite .",
    "in this paper , we calculated rare higgs three body decay @xmath0 induced by top - higgs fcnc coupling in the lht model . according to the parameters in the mixing matrices , we considered two scenarios and found that the branching ratio for @xmath0 can reach @xmath111 in the allowed parameter space .",
