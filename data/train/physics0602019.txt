    "since the first report of sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy ( sfg - vs ) experiment in early 1987,@xcite sfg - vs has been widely used to investigate various molecular interfaces , including vapor / liquid , liquid / liquid , air(vacuum gas)/solid , and liquid / solid interfaces , because sfg - vs , as one of the second order nonlinear optical processes , is interface selective and is sensitive to submonolayer changes at the molecular interface.@xcite since the very beginning , quantitative interpretation of the sfg - vs spectra has been used to derive molecular orientational structure and order of the molecular interfaces under study.@xcite    the key for such quantitative interpretation lies on the ability to obtain or estimate the ratios between different microscopic polarizability @xmath3 tensor elements of a chemical group in a molecule.@xcite so far , almost all of the efforts have focused on the stretching vibrational modes .",
    "the approaches employed to obtain the @xmath0 tensor ratios are all based on the following general relationship between the second order hyperpolarizability tensors ( @xmath4 ) for a particular vibrational mode @xmath5 to the raman polarizability derivative tensors ( @xmath6 , usually denote as @xmath7 ) and dipole moment derivative tensors ( @xmath8 , usually denote as @xmath9 ) of the @xmath5th mode , i.e.,@xcite    @xmath10    here @xmath11 represents the molecular coordinates system , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the vibrational frequency , and the normal coordinates of the @xmath5th vibrational mode of the molecule , respectively . therefore , according to eq.[beta ] , if the proper ratios between different @xmath7 terms and the ratios between different @xmath9 terms are known , the ratios of @xmath4 elements can be readily obtained .    among the approaches to obtain @xmath4 tensor ratios , which shall be compared in detail in section ii",
    ", the bond additivity model is based on symmetry analysis along with the raman bond polarizability derivative theory and the bond moment theory.@xcite in some cases , it has been proven successful in quantitative interpretation of the symmetric stretching ( ss ) vibrational mode in sfg - vs studies.@xcite however , it often failed to quantitatively predict the sfg spectral intensity relationship between the symmetric stretching ( ss ) and asymmetric stretching ( as ) vibrational modes , as shall be discussed in detail in section ii .",
    "therefore , the limitations and effectiveness of the bond additivity model still needs to be investigated .    in this report",
    ", we shall employ an complete empirical approach to the bond additivity model by using experimental ir and raman spectra to correct the discrepancies between the @xmath7 and @xmath9 tensors of the molecular groups .",
    "the effectiveness of this approach shall be demonstrated with the ss and as modes of the ch@xmath1 group in ch@xmath1oh and ch@xmath1cd@xmath2oh molecules .",
    "we shall show that with the experimentally corrected @xmath7 and @xmath9 tensor relationships , the @xmath14 tensor ratios calculated from eq.[beta ] can be used successfully to quantitatively interpret detailed polarization dependence in sfg - vs spectra of the vapor / ch@xmath1oh and vapor / ch@xmath1cd@xmath2oh interfaces .",
    "this empirical approach overcomes the limitations of the current simple bond additivity model , and it also provides a practical roadmap for its application in sfg - vs studies of molecular interfaces .",
    "this approach also demonstrates how to use molecular ir and raman spectra in the bulk liquid or gaseous phases for quantitative understanding of the sfg - vs vibrational spectra of the same molecule at the interface , and _",
    "here we briefly compare the different approaches for obtaining @xmath4 tensor ratios , and discuss how and why the bond additivity model failed to predict the sfg spectral intensity relationship between the symmetric stretching ( ss ) and asymmetric stretching ( as ) vibrational modes      as a 3rd rank tensor , @xmath4 has @xmath15 tensor elements in total . in the most ideal case , the ratios between all of these tensor elements should be determined _",
    "recently , hore _",
    "proposed a whole molecule approach based on a general scheme for _ ab initio _ calculation of the vibrational hyperpolarizability of any ir- and raman - active mode , regardless of the molecular symmetry or complexity of the structure , and application of this approach to the -oso@xmath1 headgroup of a surfactant molecule at the air / water interface was also demonstrated.@xcite with the tremendous advancement of the capability and availability of the _ ab initio _ computation methods , the advantage of this whole molecule approach is apparent . however , because this approach is purely computational , its general accuracy can be affected by the limitations of the current _ ab initio _ computational methods in reproducing the raman and ir spectra intensities , as well as in dealing with the problem of mode couplings , such as fermi resonances .",
    "nevertheless , this attempt does provide an promising alternative solution to the limitations of other existing approaches .",
    "unlike the whole molecule approach mentioned above , these other approaches all employed the local mode assumption of the particular molecular group .",
    "the bond additivity model even further employed the local mode assumption of the particular bonds . with the knowledge of the symmetry of the molecular groups ,",
    "the number of non - zero @xmath4 tensor elements can be significantly reduced ; accordingly , the number of non - zero @xmath7 elements of the symmetry group can also be significantly reduced.@xcite for example , the ch@xmath1 and ch@xmath2 groups can be treated with @xmath16 and @xmath17 symmetries , respectively . thus , their non - zero @xmath4 elements for the stretching vibrational modes are reduced to 11 and 7 , respectively.@xcite there have been discussions on whether the local mode treatment of the ch@xmath1 and ch@xmath2 groups with @xmath16 and @xmath17 symmetries , respectively , is valid.@xcite however , such concerns have not been a serious issue because it has been generally accepted in molecular spectroscopy textbook that ` ... in the case of c - h stretches , the high frequency of the local vibration of the c - h bond tends to uncouple that motion from that of the rest of the molecule ' . @xcite in addition , slight deviation from @xmath16 symmetry of the ch@xmath1 group in actual molecules can be treated with small perturbations , as discussed by hirose _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite .",
    "one such approach used experimental raman depolarization ratio to determine the @xmath4 ratios of the symmetric stretching ( ss ) mode of @xmath18 and the stretching mode of @xmath19 groups , because both groups have only two independent @xmath4 terms for the ss mode under the local group mode assumption , i.e. , there is only one @xmath4 ratio @xmath20 need to be determined.@xcite the coordinates @xmath21 is define as in fig.[ch3coordinates ] .",
    "this direct raman polarization ratio method worked because according to eq.[beta ] , @xmath22 for the ss mode of @xmath18 and the stretching mode of @xmath19 groups , and it can be obtained from raman experimental depolarization measurement.@xcite this approach has been widely used and worked successfully because it is purely empirical , and it solely depends on the reliability of the particular raman depolarization measurement.@xcite    one may surmise that even though the group itself may not strictly observe the @xmath18 or @xmath19 symmetry , because this @xmath23 value is the effective value obtained from the raman spectral features with the assumption of @xmath18 or @xmath19 symmetry , it should dutifully reproduce back to the same features of the raman spectra with the same assumption of symmetry . because this @xmath23 value is strictly the same for the corresponding @xmath4 ratio according to eq .",
    "[ beta ] , it is not hard to see that with this @xmath23 value and the same assumption of symmetry , the related features in the sfg - vs spectral can be reproduced .",
    "this is why this approach has worked so well for the ss mode of the @xmath18 and the stretching mode of the @xmath19 symmetry groups.@xcite    however , this approach can not be applied to @xmath24 group , which has three instead of two independent @xmath4 terms for its ss mode.@xcite furthermore , this approach does not deal with the ratio between the @xmath4 of symmetric and asymmetric stretching modes of the @xmath18 molecular group .",
    "therefore , it can not be used to address the relative sfg intensity of the ss and as modes of the @xmath18 molecular group .     symmetry .",
    "illustrated with the @xmath25 group.,width=151 ]    an useful alternative method in the sfg - vs literature is the widely used bond additivity model , which can give @xmath4 ratios of the @xmath18 , @xmath24 , @xmath19 and other symmetry groups , including both of their ss and as modes.@xcite the bond additivity model can also be called the bond polarizability derivative model . as hore _",
    "et al . _ pointed out recently,@xcite the key to the bond additivity model is that through symmetry analysis the polarizability tensors of the individual bond stretches ( @xmath19 ) are coupled to produce the normal mode coordinate of a particular molecular group ( @xmath18 , @xmath24 , etc.).@xcite there are two ways to determine the polarizability tensors ratios of the individual bond stretches , i.e. @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the single bond fixed coordinates with @xmath28 as the primary axis of the single bond .",
    "one way is through theoretical ( _ ab initio _ )",
    "calculation of the raman tensors of the single bond,@xcite and the other way is through experimentally measured raman depolarization ratio , or raman intensity ratio between the ss and as modes,@xcite on the basis that the single bond posses @xmath19 symmetry and that @xmath29 for a single bond according to eq.[beta ] .",
    "the detailed formula and the effectiveness , as well as some limitations , of the bond polarizability model was critically reviewed recently.@xcite so far , this model have been used for study of h@xmath2o molecule at the air / water interfaces,@xcite -ch@xmath2- groups@xcite and occasionally -ch@xmath1 groups@xcite at various molecular interfaces .",
    "the unique success of the bond additivity model has been on h@xmath2o molecules and -ch@xmath2- groups to which direct raman polarization ratio method can not be applied as mentioned above . in terms of -ch@xmath1 or other c@xmath30 groups ,",
    "the bond additivity model is essentially the same thing as the direct raman depolarization ratio method for the ss mode .",
    "another unique advantage of the bond additivity model is that it can give the @xmath4 ratio between the ss and as modes for the c@xmath30 group.@xcite however , some intrinsic weakness of the bond additivity model has limited its effectiveness on interpretation of the relative intensity of the ss and as modes in actual sfg - vs spectra .",
    "this is discussed in detail as in the followings .",
    "the bond additivity model uses the raman bond polarizability derivative tensors @xmath7 and the bond moment derivative tensors @xmath9 to calculate @xmath14 tensors according to eq.[beta].@xcite in raman and ir spectroscopy studies , the bond polarizability theory and the bond moment theory have been used to interpret the ir and raman spectral intensity.@xcite as we have known , even though the raman bond polarizability derivative model have worked well with the intensities of the ss modes , it has not been very effective on the relative intensity between the ss and as modes of the same molecular group.@xcite furthermore , the simple bond moment hypothesis , also called the zero - order bond moment theory , as used in the bond additivity model in sfg - vs , has not been successful in interpretation of ir intensities.@xcite this is because the simple bond moment theory essentially neglects all coupling effect between the single bonds even within the same molecular group .",
    "therefore , modified bond moment theory which includes such and other coupling effects has been proposed,@xcite but such modified theory becomes complicated by introduced many unknown parameters in order to address the coupling terms . in short ,",
    "these facts certainly limit the effectiveness of the bond additivity model for quantitative interpretation of the sfg - vs spectra .",
    "however , with all these problems , two of the important and successful features of the bond additivity model should not be overlooked .",
    "firstly , the bond additivity model rooted deeply into the concept of molecular symmetry analysis , which is the basis for the polarization selection rules and has provided clear physical picture for understanding of the polarization and orientational dependence in sfg - vs,@xcite as well as all other spectroscopic techniques.@xcite secondly , the direct raman polarization ratio method has been quantitatively successful in many of the sfg - vs applications.@xcite since a full computational solution for quantitative interpretation of the sfg - vs spectra is yet not within our reach as mentioned above , it can certainly be beneficial to extend the bond additivity model if we can use the core concept for its successes , and try to directly address the limitations in the consisting raman and ir theories .",
    "the failure of the bond additivity model came to our attention in our recent study of sfg - vs spectra of vapor / alcohol interfaces of c@xmath31-c@xmath32 alcohols in the ch stretching vibration region between 2800 to 3000@xmath33.@xcite the fact has been long known that there has been no observation of the @xmath25-as peak , which should be around 2970@xmath33 , in the sfg - vs spectra of the vapor / methanol interface;@xcite while for longer chain alcohols ( @xmath34 alcohols ) , the @xmath25-as peak is apparently very strong in their sfg - vs spectra.@xcite even though the bond additivity model can seemingly explain why the longer chain alcohols can have stronger @xmath25-as peak in the sfg - vs spectra of their vapor / liquid interfaces than that of the vapor / methanol interface,@xcite it also predict that the @xmath25-as mode of methanol should be observable in the sps sfg - vs spectrum .",
    "fig.[methanolsfg ] presents the sfg - vs spectra and the calculated polarization dependence against the ch@xmath1 orientational angle @xmath35 from the interface normal using the bond additivity model in the ssp , ppp , and sps polarizations for two different experimental configurations .",
    "the sfg - vs intensity is proportional to @xmath36 , and the detail of calculation has been presented previously.@xcite it is to be noted that calculation of the ss mode intensity uses @xmath37 as unit , and the as mode uses @xmath38 as unit .",
    "it is clear that for both experimental configurations , @xmath25-as mode around 2970@xmath33 can not be observed in the sfg - vs spectra .",
    "this tells us that the missing of the @xmath25-as mode peak is not something accidental . with the bond additivity model",
    ", methanol has @xmath39 for its ch@xmath1 group , as calculated in section iii . therefore , from the calculation results in fig.[methanolsfg ]",
    ", @xmath25-as should be experimentally observable in at least one of the three polarizations in comparison to the intensities of the @xmath25-ss mode .",
    "recent measurements have determined that for vapor / methanol interface the @xmath25 orientation is close to the interface normal.@xcite with this ch@xmath1 group orientation , the bond additivity model predicted that the @xmath25-ss mode in the ppp polarization can be observed in the second experimental configuration ( vis=37@xmath40 and ir=51@xmath40 ) , and this spectral feature was indeed observed with the expected intensity as indicated in fig.[methanolsfg ] .",
    "this fact certainly suggests the effectiveness of the bond additivity model calculations for the @xmath25-ss mode of methanol molecule .",
    "accordingly , if the bond additivity calculation is also effective for the as mode , the @xmath25-as mode intensity in the sps polarization should be more than 1/3 of that of the @xmath25-ss mode in the ssp polarization of the first experimental configuration",
    ". however , no such @xmath25-as mode has been ever observed.@xcite this clearly demonstrates the failure of the bond additivity model in dealing with the @xmath25-as mode , even though the intensities of the @xmath25-ss and @xmath25-ss - fermi modes can be quantitatively explained as in fig.[methanolsfg ] .    in comparison , fig.[ethanolspectra ] presents the sfg - vs spectra and the bond additivity model calculation of vapor / ch@xmath1cd@xmath2oh interface with the incident angles vis=62@xmath40 and ir=53@xmath40 in the sfg - vs experiment .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath25-as mode around 2970@xmath33 in the ppp polarization is even much bigger than the @xmath25-ss mode around 2870@xmath33 in the ssp polarization .",
    "this is consistent with the bond additivity model value of @xmath41 for the ch@xmath1 group of ch@xmath1cd@xmath2oh molecule , as calculated in section iv .",
    "then , why the bond additivity model works for the @xmath25-as mode of ch@xmath1cd@xmath2oh but not that of ch@xmath1oh ?    even though the bond additivity model and the direct raman polarization ratio method have been apparent success in quantitative interpretation of the polarization dependence and orientational analysis of the ch@xmath1 groups from the sfg - vs spectra of its @xmath25-ss mode,@xcite their inability and discrepancy to address the as mode intensities of the ch@xmath1 group in ch@xmath1cd@xmath2oh and ch@xmath1oh molecules are certainly unpleasant , and put uncertainties to these models .",
    "however , as discussed above , the bond additivity model is still the most useful model in obtaining the @xmath4 tensor ratios .",
    "we realized that the effectiveness of these models on the ss mode of the @xmath18 and the stretching mode of the @xmath19 symmetry lies on the fact that their @xmath23 values are empirically obtained .",
    "on the other hand , the failures of these models also lie on the fact that those other ratios were not set on the same empirical basis . in order to address these problems and to have better understanding of the bond additivity model",
    ", we propose an complete empirical approach in order to correct the failures of the bond additivity model .",
    "this approach includes the full empirical treatment of the ss vs. as ratios of the raman and ir tensors , in addition to the successful empirical treatment of the ss mode .",
    "in a recently review on quantitative treatment on sfg - vs from molecular interfaces , we discussed related issues on the bond additivity model in detail.@xcite we pointed out that the original expression given by hirose _ _ et al.__@xcite needed to be corrected for some minor errors , and the correct expressions for the c@xmath30 , c@xmath42 and c@xmath43 groups were presented.@xcite we also presented some good examples to demonstrate the validity of the bond additivity model for quantitative analysis of sfg - vs spectra , especially for interpretation of the ss modes of the c@xmath30 , c@xmath42 and c@xmath43 groups , and we also pointed out that further detailed examinations of this model were still needed.@xcite    therefore , here we shall try to keep the successful part of the bond additivity model , which is to use the experimental raman depolarization ratio of the ss mode to obtain the single bond raman polarizability derivative tensor ratio @xmath44 , and try to derive the expressions for the raman and ir intensity expressions for the ss and as mode of the c@xmath30 group , in order to obtain the corrections factors for the @xmath7 ratios and @xmath9 ratios between the ss and as modes from the experimental raman and ir spectra , respectively .",
    "we hope this approach can produce the corrected @xmath4 tensor ratios between the ss and as modes , and can be used to quantitatively address the above discussed problems in the sfg - vs spectra of the vapor / ch@xmath1oh and vapor / ch@xmath1cd@xmath2oh interfaces .    for the stretching vibrational modes of a molecular group with c@xmath30 symmetry ,",
    "there are a single symmetric mode ( @xmath45 ) and a doubly degenerated asymmetric mode ( @xmath46 ) , with the following relationships between the @xmath14 , @xmath7 and @xmath9 tensors when there is no electronic resonances.@xcite    for the @xmath45 ( symmetric ) mode : @xmath47    for the e ( asymmetric ) mode : @xmath48    it is to be noted that the @xmath49 and @xmath50 tensors of the symmetric mode are different from the @xmath49 and @xmath50 tensors of the asymmetric mode .    for a rotationally isotropic interface , the four asymmetric @xmath14 terms , namely @xmath51 , are dumb tensors , which would not appear in the non - zero elements of the 3rd rank macroscopic susceptibility @xmath52 tensors.@xcite therefore ,",
    "if @xmath53 is known from the direct raman depolarization ratio method , in addition , only the ratio @xmath54 need to be obtained for all useful @xmath14 tensor ratios.@xcite according to eq.[beta ] , one has ,    @xmath55    therefore , with the frequencies of the symmetric and asymmetric modes ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively ) known , only the raman tensor ratio @xmath58 and the ir tensor ratio @xmath59 need to be known to make the calculation of @xmath54",

    "when vertically linear polarized light is used for the raman experiment , the following relationships for the raman depolarization ratio and raman intensity ratio in the parallel polarization to the individual raman polarizability derivative tensors ( @xmath7 ) are generally valid for all molecular groups.@xcite    @xmath61    with the definition of    @xmath62\\label{gamma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the molecular coordinates are defined as in fig.[ch3coordinates ] . if natural light is used for the raman spectra measurement , the factor @xmath63 used in eq.[ramanratio ] should be @xmath64 , and the depolarization ratio becomes @xmath65.@xcite    in this case , if one puts eq.[ramanss ] into eq.[ramandpratio ] , because there are only three non - zero symmetric tensors , a unique @xmath23 value ( generally @xmath66 for c@xmath30 groups , and @xmath67 for c@xmath43 groups ) can be obtained from the symmetric tensors through the experimental value of the raman depolarization ratio @xmath68 of the @xmath18 symmetric mode.@xcite    @xmath69 ^ 2}\\label{rhodefinition}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here the eq.[rhodefinition ] for obtaining @xmath23 is the so called direct raman depolarization ratio method because @xmath23 directly satisfies eq.[sfgss ] according to eq.[beta].@xcite    however , since the raman depolarization ratio for the asymmetric mode @xmath70 is always a constant , no knowledge of the asymmetric tensors can be learned from the direct raman depolarization ratio method .",
    "therefore , one now have to employ the bond additivity model to make such connection through eq.[ramanratio ] .    in the bond additivity model ,",
    "the single bond property is used to calculate the property of the whole group . following hirose _",
    "s formulation,@xcite the raman polarizability derivative of the single bond can be related to the following three non - zero tensor elements with the following relationship ,    @xmath71    in which @xmath28 is the primary axis of the single bond coordinates , and the stretching vibration displacement @xmath72 from its equilibrium position is along the single bond .",

    "all values are normalized to the strongest peak in the raman and ir spectra , respectively.[methanoltable ] [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     if we put @xmath110 for ch@xmath1oh into eq.[ratio - r ] , we have @xmath111 for @xmath73 ; while if we put @xmath112 for ch@xmath1cd@xmath2oh into eq.[ratio - r ] , there is no solution of @xmath44 for @xmath113 at all .",
    "this clearly shows that eq.[rho - r ] and eq.[ratio - r ] do not generally give consistent @xmath44 values , and certainly they can not be held true at the same time .",
    "now , with the corrected @xmath54 value for ch@xmath1oh , the fact of missing ch@xmath1-as mode in sfg - vs from vapor / ch@xmath1oh interface can be readily addressed . from the calculated intensities in fig.[methanolsfg ] with vis=62@xmath40 and ir=53@xmath40 experimental configuration ,",
    "@xmath114 with the uncorrected bond additivity model value @xmath39 , and with the known orientation angle @xmath115 from previous studies.@xcite now , with the corrected value @xmath116 , the @xmath117 ratio should be ( 3.8/1.1)@xmath118 times smaller , i.e. , @xmath119 .",
    "it is easy to see that such a small @xmath120 comparing to @xmath121 is below the noise level and its spectral feature can not be observed in the sfg - vs spectra .",
    "convincingly , using above approach , inspection of the ir and raman spectra of liquid acetone and acetonitrile also indicated that the ch@xmath1-as vs. ch@xmath1-ss intensity ratio values are significantly smaller than the values calculated from the simple bond additivity model for their sfg - vs spectra from vapor / liquid interfaces.@xcite    it is interesting to see that the correction for the @xmath54 value is very small for ch@xmath1cd@xmath2oh , even though the corrections for @xmath58 and @xmath59 are not so small separately .",
    "these two corrections happened to cancel each other when used to calculate @xmath54 with eq.[betaratio ] . using this ratio ,",
    "the sfg - vs spectra of ch@xmath1cd@xmath2oh can be well interpreted just as with the uncorrected bond additivity model.@xcite however , it is to be noted that the success of the former is with firm empirical basis , and the success of the latter is nevertheless coincidental .",
    "we have performed measurements on the sfg - vs spectra in different incident angles for the vapor / ethanol interface , and analysis show that with the @xmath14 tensor ratios obtained here , all spectra as well as the spectra interference effects , can be quantitatively interpreted , and detailed molecular orientation analysis is also possible.@xcite    according to above discussion , the success of the corrected bond additivity model is evident .",
    "this success indicates that the failure of the bond additivity model discussed in section iib can be quantitatively corrected with the empirical approach as demonstrated here .",
    "however , we have to caution that this success is purely empirical , and may not be as general as it seems before further examinations being made . even though it is undoubtedly an advancement from the simple bond additivity model , there are reasons this empirical approach may fail .    because the correction for the bond additivity model used the raman and ir spectra in the liquid phase",
    ", the success of this correction undoubtedly indicates that the ch@xmath1 group of these molecules under studying are not significantly different as in the liquid bulk phases or at the interfaces",
    ". this may only be true for the generally ` rigid ' c - h stretching vibrations which is usually not greatly perturbed and the assumption of local motion is generally valid .",
    "but this may not be true for the less ` rigid ' molecular groups .",
    "based on the successful treatment with the ch@xmath1 groups , we may assume that the same treatment on the similarly ` rigid ' nh@xmath1 and ch@xmath2 groups is also going to work .",
    "if this approach fails to quantitatively interpret the sfg - vs spectra for a particular molecular group , one may try to consider the possibility that this group might have been very differently perturbed in the bulk phase from at the interface .",
    "one clear advantage of this empirical approach is that the problem of the fermi resonance and combinational mode couplings is automatically addressed through the empirical correction .",
    "as we have known , to assess the effects of such accidental resonances and couplings can be a very difficult problem in _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "therefore , the empirical treatment discussed here may provide a way to quantitatively test the whole molecule approach.@xcite for example , one direct may is to try to use the whole molecule approach to calculate the polarizability tensors of the ch@xmath1 group in the ch@xmath1oh and ch@xmath1cd@xmath2oh , and compare the results directly with the ir , raman and sfg - vs data . provided with successful applications to a series of clearly studied molecular systems",
    ", one may expect that in the future _ ab initio _ computation can be generally applied for quantitative interpretation of nonlinear spectroscopy .",
    "in summary , we discussed a total empirical approach with symmetry analysis to quantitatively interpret observed sfg - vs spectra from molecular interfaces . in such an approach ,",
    "the raman and ir tensor ratios are directly calculated from raman and ir spectral measurements using a certain correction procedure to the bond additivity model .",
    "this approach is tested with the sfg - vs spectra from vapor / ch@xmath1oh and vapor / ch@xmath1cd@xmath2oh interfaces .",
    "there have been few attempts to use raman and ir spectra in the condensed phase to quantitatively interpret sfg - vs spectra from molecular interfaces in detail .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the bond additivity model has been successful in quantitative interpretation of sfg - vs of the ch@xmath1 and ch@xmath2 as well as h@xmath2o groups for their ss modes,@xcite but it has not been as successful with the as of these molecules or molecular groups . through analysis of the problem we understood the empirical basis for the successes of the bond additivity model .",
    "so we proposed to treat the failures of the bond additivity model with a complete empirical approach . in this report we successfully demonstrated with two examples that the empirical corrections to the bond additivity model can successfully interpret what the simple bond additivity model failed .",
    "this development can become a new addition to the existing methodologies in quantitative sfg - vs studies.@xcite we believe that this empirical approach can provide new understanding of the effectiveness and limitations of the bond additivity model , and this report also provided a practical roadmap for its application in sfg - vs studies of molecular interfaces .",

    "then the @xmath140 and @xmath141 values can be obtained using this @xmath44 value . in order to calculate @xmath142 ,",
