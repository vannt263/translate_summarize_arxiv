    "experimentally , several angle resolved photoemission ( arpes ) studies@xcite show constant nodeless gaps on all fermi surfaces ( fss ) , but evidence for the existence of nodal gaps has been reported in many transport measurements as well.@xcite it has been argued that the properties of the gap may be material dependent or that a nodal gap may be rendered nodeless by disorder,@xcite but a consensus has not been reached .    the goal of this paper is to understand the constraints that symmetries and the number of active degrees of freedom in the pnictides impose on the possible pairing operators . we will consider a _ five _ orbital model that retains the five @xmath7 orbitals of each of the two fe atoms in the unit cell of the feas planes.@xcite employing mean - field approximations we will discuss comparisons with results obtained in models with three@xcite and two@xcite orbitals that can be studied numerically .",

    "the properties of the pairing operators can be studied under a mean - field approximation .",
    "we need to remember that the five - orbital model is defined in terms of a pseudocrystal momentum @xmath48 in an extended brillouin zone.@xcite in terms of the real momentum , the unit cell of the fe - as planes contains two fe ions and , thus , the band structure is composed of 10 bands in the reduced , or folded , brillouin zone ( bz ) .",

    "if only intraorbital pairing operators are considered it is sufficient to build a @xmath55 bogoliuvov - degennes ( bdg ) matrix , but for interorbital pairing between electrons in orbitals 1 , 2 with electrons in orbitals 3 , 4 , or 5 , it is necessary to construct a @xmath56 bdg matrix since the @xmath55 matrix only allows to consider intraorbital pairs with pseudocrystal momentum @xmath57 rather than @xmath58.@xcite    the @xmath55 bdg hamiltonian is given by : @xmath59 with the definitions @xmath60 and @xmath61 where each element represents a @xmath11 block with @xmath62 given by eq .",

    "the motivation is given by the fact that in standard bcs theory , the pairing occurs between particles with momentum equal in magnitude but opposite direction at a _",
    "common _ fermi surface .",
    "for this reason , even in multiorbital systems , it has been expected that pairing attraction should involve particles in the same band.@xcite to determine whether a pairing operator consists of purely intraband matrix elements , we need to transform eq .  [ 15 ] from the orbital to the band representation in which @xmath67 is diagonal .",
    "the transformation is given by @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the unitary change of basis matrix and @xmath70 is the transpose conjugate of @xmath69 . since @xmath71 is unitary , for each value of @xmath48 , @xmath72 .",
    "then , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the @xmath75 unitary matrix composed of two @xmath11 blocks given by @xmath71 .",

    "notice that if @xmath81 in eq.([16 ] ) , @xmath82 in eq.([15b ] ) is proportional to the identity matrix and , thus , @xmath83 is diagonal with @xmath84 for all @xmath85 .",
    "this indicates that the _ intraorbital _ operator that pairs electrons in each orbital with _ equal strength _ , gives rise to a purely intraband pairing operator where electrons in each band are subject to an identical pairing attraction . in this case , diagonalizing eq.([17 ] ) we obtain @xmath86 .",
    "then , at @xmath87 where @xmath88",
    "we obtain @xmath89 .",

    "however , for the pnictides it is believed that a non - bcs interaction provides the source of pairing.@xcite then , we must consider the case in which @xmath94 .",
    "notice that since @xmath95 transforms according to @xmath96 , the symmetry of this purely intraband pairing operator is then totally determined by the symmetry of @xmath2 .      in the particular case",

    "note that the gap on the two hole fss would differ only if they have considerably different fermi momentum which is not the case in the pnictides since both hole pockets are very close to each other .",
    "in the five - orbital model we found that @xmath101 for the external hole and electron pockets , while @xmath102 for the external and internal hole pockets .",
    "this means that the gaps in the two hole pockets would have a difference of only about 10% .",
    "the two fermi surfaces would have to be much more separated from each other in order to develop the experimentally observed difference of 50% reported via arpes experiments.@xcite    in fig .",
    "[ spmgap ] we show the gap as a function of the angular position ( from the @xmath103 to the @xmath104 axis ) along the four fermi surfaces ( two electron and two hole pockets ) for the five - orbital model in the folded bz .",
    "note that the values of the gap beyond @xmath105 can be obtained by symmetry from the values shown in fig .",
    "[ spmgap ] .",
    "the interaction @xmath106 was chosen in order to obtain a quantitative match with experimentally reported values of the gaps that range between 1 to 20 mev.@xcite as expected , it can be seen that the gaps at the external hole and electron pockets ( dashed , continuous , and dotted lines ) almost overlap with each other and have a magnitude of about 7 mev while at the internal hole pocket ( dotted - dashed line ) the gap is around 8 mev , i.e. only about 10% larger .",
    "note that the momentum dependence observed here likely will be negligible when considering experimental uncertainties .",
    "thus , these results would be in good agreement with the arpes measurements reported in ref .",
    "if we assume that the 50% smaller gap arises in a third hole pocket , rich in @xmath44 orbital content , that is not present in this five - orbital model .",

    "results are shown as a function of the angle @xmath112 between 0 and @xmath113 measured with respect to the @xmath114 axis in counterclockwise [ clockwise ] direction for the hole [ electron ( at x)]-pockets .",
    "the results are in the folded brillouin zone.[spmgap],title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] 0.3 cm      since several experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite efforts have reported the existence of at least two independent gaps at the fermi surfaces of some pnictides , the next issue to consider is whether there is any other pairing state allowed by symmetry that is purely intraband and able to generate independent gaps in at least one of the fss .",
    "it can be shown that , with the exception of @xmath95 , all the other 24 @xmath14 matrices become non - diagonal in the band representation , i.e. , @xmath115 is non - diagonal at least for some values of @xmath48 in the bz .",
    "this is true even for @xmath14 matrices that are diagonal in the orbital representation such as @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "thus , _ all _ these purely intraorbital pairing operators lead to _ interband _ matrix elements in their band representation .",
    "note that to generate an intraorbital pairing operator that couples electrons in different orbitals with arbitrary strengths we need to consider linear combinations of these diagonal pairing matrices using form factors that provide a well defined symmetry , since we assumed , guided by numerical simulations in models with two and three orbitals , that the pairing operator connects non - degenerate ground states that transform according to one of the one - dimensional irreducible representations of @xmath47 .",
    "we will consider a linear combination of the four intraorbital pairing operators allowed by symmetry that do not require the pairing to be the same in all orbitals .",
    "@xmath95 is excluded because we already know that it does not produce interband pairing and , thus , it will not contribute to off - diagonal elements in the band representation of the pairing operator .",
    "the linear combination to be considered is given by : @xmath118 where @xmath119 are form factors chosen such that all the terms in @xmath120 transform according to the same irreducible representation .",
    "notice that @xmath117 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 transform according to @xmath96 , but @xmath116 transforms according to @xmath110 .",
    "thus , for example , a nearest - neighbor pairing operator that transforms according to @xmath96 will be obtained by setting @xmath121 and @xmath122 . in the band representation @xmath120",
    "becomes @xmath123 if the pairing is purely intraband then @xmath124 has to be diagonal .",
    "but from the orthogonality properties of @xmath71 we see that a non - diagonal element @xmath125 can only be zero if @xmath126 is the same for all @xmath127 .",
    "however , this is only true for the pairing operator proportional to @xmath95 and we have proven numerically that only for @xmath128 in eq .  [",
    "20 ] is @xmath129 for @xmath130 .",
    "thus , intraorbital pairing with orbital dependent strength leads to interband components of the pairing interaction.@xcite    then , we conclude that if the pairing interaction is purely intraband the pairing mechanism should be associated to a degree of freedom that couples to the five different orbitals with the _ same _ strength .",
    "this means that the gaps in all different fss must be related , i.e. , the symmetry does not allow unrelated gaps in this case .",
    "conversely , if independent gaps are observed on different fss the symmetry of the highly hybridized orbitals indicates that interband interactions would be present at least in some regions of momentum space , as it will be discussed below.@xcite     and @xmath131 , characterizing the bands at high symmetry points in the reduced bz , are indicated . for more details",

    "the external hole pocket has a smaller gap , about 3.5 mev , with a very weak momentum dependence ( dashed line ) .",
    "the strongest dependence with momentum occurs in the external electron pocket ( continuous line ) with the gap reaching a value of about 7.5 mev at the point along the @xmath103-axis where the electron pocket is the closest to the hole pockets and has pure @xmath45 orbital character . as the point where the two electron - like fss intersect each other ( @xmath105 ) is approached , the external electron - pocket acquires @xmath151 character and the magnitude of the gap converges to the almost momentum independent value of 5 mev that characterizes the internal electron - pocket .",
    "thus , this is a case in which a direct measurement of the gaps would indicate the presence of three `` independent '' gaps .",
    "the gaps in the internal electron and hole pockets behave as expected in the @xmath97 pairing scenario,@xcite while the external hole and electron pockets show a different gap value .",
    "while this would agree with experimental results that favor multiple gaps@xcite it is important to realize that this pairing operator contains interband matrix elements that must be incorporated in the description of a possible pairing mechanism .    modifying @xmath144 we can tune the relative gap values , obtaining three almost momentum independent gaps with values 3.5 mev , 5.5 mev , and 7.5 mev ( in the external - hole , internal - hole , and internal - electron pockets , respectively ) as shown in fig .",
    "in addition , a gap with momentum dependence ranging between 15 mev and 7.5 mev appears at the external electron pocket which has the largest @xmath45 contribution .",
    "thus , this interaction would lead to four apparently independent nodeless gaps .",
    "+      as discussed above , due to the strong hybridization of all five @xmath7 orbitals we have verified that all the intraorbital pairing operators allowed by the lattice and orbital symmetries of the pnictides lead to interband pairing interactions if @xmath152 .",
    "interband pairing has always been considered unlikely in bcs theory @xcite because the pairing attraction acts in a very narrow energy range around the fs . however , in a system in which two fss formed by different bands are very close to each other ( e.g. the two hole pockets in the pnictides that can not be distinguished in arpes experiments,@xcite or the two electron pockets that intersect at two points ) then the formation of interband pairs , as it was described in ref .  ,",

    "both gaps are maximized along the diagonal direction ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "thus , it would resemble `` @xmath159-wave '' behavior in experiments where only the node location but not the phase of the gap can be measured .",

    "another characteristic of the @xmath153 pairing operator is that the gap in the electron pockets presents nodes along the @xmath103 and @xmath104 axes ( for the same reason than the hole pockets at weak @xmath107 ) but also at the points where the two electron pockets cross , @xmath105 , because @xmath161 there . for @xmath162",

    "it is only at the very few points on the fs where @xmath83 has finite ( zero ) non - diagonal ( diagonal ) elements that the pairing attraction will be purely interband . at these points ,",
    "if the pairing attraction is weak we would expect to observe nodes.@xcite it is only when the two fs are very close ( as for the two almost degenerate hole pockets ) , and when the pairing interaction is strong enough , that interband pairs would be possible.@xcite    as pointed out in the introduction , the properties of the pairing operator in the pnictides have not been established yet and data obtained with different experimental techniques are in disagreement .",
    "arpes results are interpreted as indicative of nodeless gaps with at most a very weak momentum dependence .",
    "some groups have identified gaps with the same magnitude in the electron and one of the hole pockets,@xcite while others have found them to be different.@xcite in addition , the gap in a third hole pocket , not of @xmath42/@xmath43 character , is found to be different from the gap in the electron pockets and , thus , the existence of two and , even three , gaps in these materials has been proposed .",
    "the symmetry arguments presented here indicate that truly momentum independent gaps would have to be equal ( including the sign of the order parameter ) in all fermi surfaces .",
    "if a momentum dependence is allowed , then a pairing state such as the @xmath97 could arise . in this case",
    "the gap in the hole and electron pockets related by nesting should be very similar ( although with opposite signs in the order parameters ) and the gap in the additional hole pocket would differ only by the ratio between the form factors @xmath2 at the locations of the two different hole - pockets .",
    "thus , there should be only one gap in the sense that the coupling between the electrons and the interaction causing the pairing will not be orbital dependent and the band dependence is only due to the different fermi momenta .",
    "we have also shown that a pairing interaction that couples with an orbital - dependent strength to the electrons leads to a pairing matrix that is not diagonal in the band representation . some of these operators open weakly momentum dependent nodeless gaps in the different fss .",
    "while this kind of pairing operator could agree with some experimental results , it would be necessary to take into account the interband pairing interactions when developing the associated microscopic pairing mechanism .",
    "note that the existence of nodes in the pnictides is in fact supported by transport experiments,@xcite in clear contradiction with arpes .",
    "thus , more experimental work is needed in order to clarify this issue . we have found a large variety of nodal pairing operators that respect the symmetry of the pnictides : this includes those proportional to the identity in the orbital sector , with their nodes arising from the zeroes in @xmath2 , and also other pairing operators in which electrons in different orbitals are subject to different pairing strengths and , thus , give rise to interband terms in the pairing matrices .",
    "the @xmath97 pairing operator with symmetry @xmath96 appears to be the favored one in the literature,@xcite but numerical calculations in a two - orbital model@xcite while indicating that this pairing prevails in strong coupling , lead in the intermediate regime to a pairing state made of electrons in different orbitals and with symmetry @xmath153 .",
    "since the orbitals @xmath42 and @xmath43 are strongly hybridized forming the bands that produce the hole pockets , this kind of pairing could be possible .",
    "if realized , it would induce nodes on the hole and electron pockets and the pair formation would be much stronger in the hole than in the electron pockets .",
    "interestingly , the gaps in the two hole pockets would be different ( see fig .",
    "[ gapb2 g ] ) which may be in agreement with some of the experimental results that indicate two nodal gaps.@xcite",
    "summarizing , we have shown that in a model that retains the symmetry of the feas planes for the pnictides and considers the five @xmath7 orbitals of the fe ions , a purely intraband pairing operator can only result from an intraorbital pairing interaction that affects electrons in the different orbitals with _",
    "identical strength_. in this case , the symmetry of the pairing operator is entirely determined by the form factor @xmath2 which depends only on the spatial location of the particles that form the pairs . as a result",
    ", gaps in different portions of the fs can differ only by the ratios of the form factors , i.e. , two or more unrelated gaps _ can not _ occur .",
    "conversely , multiple gaps as observed experimentally , or orbital dependent pairing attractions , would indicate interband pairing interactions at least in some regions of the bz .",
    "then , this feature should be incorporated in theoretical proposals for the pairing mechanism .",
    "if there are special points in the bz where the attraction is purely interband , then nodes or interband pairing will occur depending on whether the interaction is weak or strong .",
    "experimental measurements of the gap magnitude indicate that the pairing attraction is weak , thus nodes rather than interband pairing would be expected .",
    "the present analysis suggests that if the pairing mechanism is purely intraband , as assumed by many , then no unrelated gaps should occur in the different portions of the fs .",
    "reciprocally , if it is experimentally confirmed the existence of two or more unrelated gaps this would point to the need to consider interband , in addition to intraband , pairing interactions in any realistic microscopic description of the pairing mechanism .",
