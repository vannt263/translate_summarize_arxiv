    "we will provide a general framework for characterizing such small errors ; see proposition  [ prop - facto ] below .",
    "in addition , friedman and rothman  @xcite extended the `` degree of unfriendliness '' to any  integer @xmath3 , where any two people have to sit with at least @xmath4 unoccupied seats between them .",
    "this extension was mentioned to be related to rnyi s parking problem and to a discrete parking problem studied by mackenzie ( see @xcite ) in which cars of the same length @xmath5 are parked uniformly at random along the curb with @xmath0 unit parking spaces .",
    "indeed , the latter problem with @xmath6 found its origin in flory s 1939 pioneering paper @xcite in polymer chemistry , and was later expanded into generic stochastic models under the name `` random sequential adsorption '' ; see @xcite for a comprehensive survey and @xcite a more recent account .    due to the simplicity and the usefulness of the model ,",
    "the same discrete parking problem was also studied independently under different guises in applied probability and related areas .",
    "page @xcite studied a random pairing model in which @xmath0 isolated points are paired randomly by adjacency until only singletons remain .",
    "this model is identical to flory s monomer - dimer model @xcite ( or the discrete parking problem @xcite where each car requires 2-unit parking space ) .",

    "then it is easy to see that @xmath8    in addition to deriving a closed - form expression for the first three moments of @xmath7 , page @xcite also computed the variance , which , when transferring to our @xmath1 , satisfies @xmath9 asymptotically , @xmath10 another interesting result in @xcite is the closed - form expression for the bivariate generating function of @xmath11 , obtained by solving a riccati equation ; see also @xcite . in terms of @xmath1",

    "see also @xcite for other properties studied . the asymptotic normality is contained as a special case of penrose and sudbury s very general central limit theorem in @xcite , where they also derived a convergence rate by stein s method .",
    "the exact solvability of such a model is however very rare in the literature , and the next possibly solvable cases are the unfriendly variants for two rows of seats with the same rule of nearest neighbors exclusion , which we may refer to as the _ unfriendly seating arrangement in a dining table_. such a model and the like were studied by physicists in the 1990 s and the `` jamming density '' ( the large-@xmath0 limit of the ratio between the expected number of persons sitting down and the total number of seats ) was given explicitly by @xmath13 using different heuristic arguments ; see @xcite .",
    "this constant is to be compared with that in the one - row case @xmath14 see also finch s book @xcite for more information .",
    "the same problem was recently reformulated as the _ unfriendly theater seating arrangement problem _ by georgiou et al .",

    "in particular , they also derived the jamming limit .",
    "unfortunately , the crucial stochastic dominance relations used in their paper @xcite are incorrect , and thus their proofs remain incomplete ( the asymptotic linearity being well expected though ) .",
    "more precisely , they claimed that if @xmath16 is an induced subgraph of @xmath17 , then the _ first - order stochastic dominance _",
    "relation @xmath18 holds in the sense that @xmath19 for all @xmath20 , where @xmath21 are the random variables counting the number of occupied seats ( or the cardinality of an independent set ) when starting with the seat configurations @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , and following the same random unfriendly seating procedure until the procedure terminates .",
    "it is known that this implies the _ second - order stochastic dominance _",
    "@xmath22    unfortunately",
    ", none of the two relations and is correct .",

    "to , consider the following two seat configurations @xmath26 then the expected numbers of occupied seats satisfy @xmath27=2>\\mathbb{e}[x_{g_2}]=5/3 $ ] .",
    "due to the subtlety of the problem , we focus our attention in this paper on the dining table model and we show that this model is also explicitly solvable by solving a system of nonlinear differential equations .",
    "this new result leads to interesting structural properties , and many strong limit theorems will then follow .",
    "in particular , our analysis provides the first rigorous , complete proof for the very simple jamming limit with an optimal error terms .",
    "some related stochastic dominance relations will be clarified in section  [ sec : sd ] .",
    "we consider a dining table with @xmath28 seats arranged in two rows @xmath29 diners arrive one after another and each selects a seat uniformly at random . if the seat is empty , then it becomes occupied , and two of its neighboring seats together with the opposite one ( in the other row ) are no more available .",
    "if the seat selected is occupied or forbidden and there are still empty seats available , then the ( uniform ) random selection is repeated until a seat is found .",
    "the process stops as long as all seats are either occupied or forbidden .",
    "an example with @xmath30 is given as follows ( where  @xmath31 \" stands for a forbidden seat and `` @xmath32 '' an occupied seat ) @xmath33    let @xmath34 count the total number of persons sitting down when such a sequential process terminates .",
    "then it is easy to see that @xmath35 by splitting the @xmath28-problem at the first occupied seat into two subproblems , we are then led to the recurrence relation for the probability generating function @xmath36 @xmath37 with @xmath38 . here",
