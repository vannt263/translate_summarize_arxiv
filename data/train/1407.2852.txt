    "<S> now the dispersion of the maximum in @xmath76 bends back above @xmath83 , acquiring a sinus shape with ( small ) excitation gaps at both @xmath77 and @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> also the spectral weight of the dynamical charge structure factor is concentrated at @xmath84 and finite but very small for @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the dispersion of the maximum in the hi phase is remindful of those of the spin-1 heisenberg chain . </S>",

    "<S> , we studied  from an entanglement point of view  the topologically nontrivial haldane insulator , appearing in the intermediate coupling regime of the 1d bose - hubbard model with on - site and nearest - neighbor coulomb interactions in the midst of mott insulator , density - wave and superfluid phases . </S>",
    "<S> using the dmrg technique , the mi - hi ( hi - dw ) quantum phase transition is determined with high precision from the central charge @xmath42 that can be extracted from the von neumann entropy . </S>",
    "<S> we thereby approved the universality class @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) predicted by field theory . </S>",
    "<S> we furthermore established a characteristic four - fold degeneracy of the lowest entanglement level in the spt haldane phase and demonstrated that any violation of the lattice inversion symmetry lifts this degeneracy . with the objective to stimulate further experiments on ultracold bosonic atoms in optical lattices </S>",
    "<S> we analyzed the dynamical charge structure factor for the extended bose - hubbard model and showed that this quantity can be used to distinguish the haldane insulator , exhibiting a gapped excitation spectrum similar to the spin-1 heisenberg - chain model , from conventional mott and density - wave states .    </S>",
