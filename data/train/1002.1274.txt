    "in the past two decades quantum computation has attracted growing interest , encouraged by the development of tools for the manipulation of single quantum objects as well as by several remarkable theoretical findings @xcite .",
    "different systems have been proposed as candidates for quantum computing ; they are based , for instance , on cavity - laser atoms , bose - einstein condensates , or nmr techniques ( see e.g. @xcite ) . at the same time , a number of quantum algorithms have been designed and some have been shown to be even exponentially faster than their best classical counterparts @xcite . in particular , quantum search algorithms , although able to achieve `` only '' a polynomial speedup , have been proved to be very promising and of widespread use in quantum computation @xcite .",
    "one of the best known quantum search algorithms is attributed to grover @xcite .",
    "the algorithm can find a target within an unsorted database made up of @xmath0 items using @xmath1 queries . due to its broad range of applications and its ability",
    "to be effectively used as a subroutine @xcite , grover s algorithm has been thoroughly investigated and a number of different implementations have been proposed ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recently , implementations based on continuous - time @xcite as well as on discrete - time quantum walks @xcite have been introduced : given that the application of random walks in classical algorithms provided significant advantages for approximations and optimization , one is strongly motivated to study quantum walks as algorithmic tools . at the current stage",
    "the aim is not only to achieve similar computational improvements , but also to understand the capabilities of quantum computations .",
    "here we focus on the approach pioneered by farhi and gutmann @xcite and further developed by childs and goldstone @xcite , based on continuous - time quantum walks ( ctqws ) .",
    "this implementation provides several important advantages : the algorithm does not need auxiliary storage space and it makes it possible to take into account the geometrical arrangement of the database ( the latter being either a physical position space or an efficiently encoded hilbert space @xcite ) . indeed , while previous studies just considered the cases of the translationally invariant @xmath2 ( named @xmath3-dimensional periodic lattices by childs and goldstone @xcite and called hypercubic lattices in statistical physics , the term which we adopt here ) and of complete graphs @xcite , here we extend the investigations to the case of generic structures and analyze how geometrical parameters [ e.g. , ( fractal ) dimension or ( average ) coordination number ; see later in this article ] affect the dynamics of the ctqw .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that quantum searches based on ctqws recover the optimal quadratic speedup on complete graphs and on high - dimensional hypercubic lattices ( with dimension @xmath4 ) , while for low - dimensional ( @xmath5 ) lattices ctqws can not outperform their classical counterpart .",
    "hence , it may appear that @xmath6 works as a `` critical dimension '' , separating highly performing structures from poorly performing ones .",
    "we will show , both analytically and numerically , that the dimension of the substrate is not sufficient for getting a sharp transition from the ground to the first excited state ; we also take into account the success probability @xmath7 , that is , the probability of finding the quantum walker at the target site @xmath8 at time @xmath9 , given as initial state the equally weighted superposition @xmath10 : an efficient quantum walk gives rise to a success probability close to @xmath11 already at very small times @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , we will take into account several kinds of structures : translationally invariant structures , such as @xmath3-dimensional hypercubic lattices , complete graphs , fractals with low fractal dimension like dual sierpinski gaskets and t - fractals , hierarchical structures as cayley trees , and structures with ( fractal ) dimensions larger than four , such as cartesian products between euclidean lattices and dual sierpinski gaskets ( for the precise definitions of these structures and of the fractal dimension considered here , see later in this article ) . in this way we are able to show that for translationally invariant structures with high dimensions",
    ", @xmath7 displays sharp peaks , while for fractals or low - dimensional structures the peaks are low and broad so that the quantum walk is not particularly effective in the sense that there exists only a low probability @xmath7 for any @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , for any structure , we evidence interference phenomena which give rise to a non - monotonic time dependence of the @xmath7 ; such effects can be significant and must be properly taken into account when considering applications .",
    "interestingly , the ctqw hamiltonian used in the quantum search also describes , in solid - state physics , the dynamics of a tight - binding particle in the presence of static , substitutional impurities . in this context",
    "our results show that in regular , highly - connected geometries ( such as the high - dimensional tori ) the probability of finding the moving particle at the impurity site is ( quasi- ) periodic in time and that the localization can be very effective .",
    "our article is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : quantum_search ] we first review basic principles concerning grover s search and we explain how it can be implemented by means of ctqws . in sec .",
    "[ ssec : inho_graphs ] we describe the structures used as substrate for the ctqw .",
    "then , in sec .  [ sec : phase_transition ] we present several analytical results , later corroborated and deepened in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerics ] , where our numerical results are shown . in sec .",
    "[ sec : success ] we focus on the success probability .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions and discussion . in appendix",
    "[ appe1 ] , appendix [ appe2 ] and appendix [ appe3 ] we report the details of our analytical calculations .",
    "grover s search algorithm @xcite is meant to solve the unsorted search problem under the assumption that there exists a computational oracle working as a black - box function able to decide whether a candidate solution is the true solution .",
    "hence , the oracle knows which is the target among the @xmath0 entries . the task is to find a target @xmath8 using the fewest calls to the oracle . while the classical algorithm requires exhaustive searches implying @xmath12 queries , grover s algorithm is able to find @xmath8 using @xmath1 queries , giving rise to a quadratic speed up @xcite .    a short outline of the idea behind grover s algorithm in the presence of a single marked target is as follows : first of all , one associates each of the @xmath0 index integers with a unique orthonormal vector @xmath13 in an @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "then , one chooses as initial state @xmath14 which is delocalized over the entire set of states @xmath15 with equal weights at every site @xmath16 .",
    "this is the least biased initialization one can arrange , given the available information ( since each of the @xmath0 nodes is in principle equally likely to be the target index , the initial state is prepared as an equally weighted superposition of all @xmath0 indices ) .",
    "now , to perform the search , one needs to make the state @xmath17 evolve into a state that has almost all the amplitude concentrated in just the @xmath18 component .",
    "in such a way a single final measurement will find the system in the state @xmath19 , hence revealing the identity of the target index .",
    "more precisely , we need an evolution operator whose repeated application makes the amplitude of @xmath18 grow with the number of iterations @xcite .",
    "this task was originally accomplished within the standard paradigm for quantum computation @xcite , namely using a discrete sequence of unitary logic gates , while in the last years several different implementations have been introduced in which the state of the quantum register evolves continuously under the influence of a driving hamiltonian @xcite . in particular , here we follow the approach developed by childs and goldstone @xcite which relies on ctqw @xcite . as already mentioned , due to their versatility , ctqws allow to model any discrete database .",
    "in fact , a generic discretizable database can be represented by a graph @xmath20 made up of a set of nodes @xmath21 , each corresponding to a different item , and of a set of links @xmath22 joining nodes pairwise in such a way that the topology of the graph mirrors the arrangement of the database .",
    "the graph @xmath23 can be algebraically described by the adjacency matrix @xmath24 whose entry @xmath25 equals one if nodes @xmath26 and @xmath27 are connected , otherwise it is zero ( also for the diagonal elements ) . from @xmath24 one",
    "can directly calculate the degree matrix @xmath28 , which is a diagonal matrix with elements @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the coordination number ( or degree ) of the @xmath26-th node , that is , the number of its nearest neighbors .    ctqws on a graph are defined by the laplacian matrix @xmath31 and obey the following schrdinger equation for the transition amplitude @xmath32 from state @xmath33 to state @xmath34 @xcite : @xmath35 where the hamiltonian is just given by @xmath36 , therefore , the time is dimensionless and given in units of the coupling elements @xmath37 .",
    "the formal solution for @xmath32 can be written as @xmath38 and its magnitude squared provides the quantum mechanical transition probability @xmath39 .",
    "notice that @xmath40 is symmetric and non - negative definite ; its ground state , corresponding to eigenvalue @xmath41 , is given by @xmath42 .",
    "due to the unitary time - evolution generated by @xmath43 , ctqws are symmetric under time - inversion , which precludes @xmath44 from attaining equipartition at long times .",
    "this is different from the behavior of classical continuous - time random walks .",
    "moreover , ctqws keep memory of the initial conditions , as exemplified by the occurrence of ( quasi- ) revivals @xcite .",
    "now , the `` oracle hamiltonian '' is given by @xmath45 whose ground state , with energy @xmath46 , is just the marked item @xmath47 ; all other states have energy zero @xcite .",
    "then , the hamiltonian @xmath43 governing the time evolution of the quantum walk is @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a tunable parameter with units of inverse time , hence dimensionless here .    the _",
    "success probability _ @xmath50 is defined as ( see also @xcite ) @xmath51 i.e. , as the transtion probability to be at time @xmath9 at the target @xmath8 when starting in the delocalized state @xmath52 .    here",
    "we study its dependence on time @xmath9 and on the parameter @xmath49 and we especially aim to evidence the existence of an optimization parameter @xmath53 , possibly depending on time , which maximizes @xmath50 .",
    "notice that , having fixed @xmath49 , the time @xmath9 can be measured in terms of the number of queries of the discrete grover oracle @xcite .",
    "before proceeding , it is worth introducing the geometrical structures on which we are focusing , first the dual sierpinski gasket ( dsg ) , the t - fractal ( tf ) , and the cayley tree ( ct ) ; examples of these structures are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : frattali]a , fig .",
    "[ fig : frattali]b , and fig .",
    "[ fig : frattali]c , respectively . notice that these structures differ significantly from those analyzed previously : while hypercubic lattices with periodic boundary conditions ( toroids ) are translationally invariant , the aforementioned structures are not .    the dsg , tf and ct can be built iteratively ; at the @xmath54-th iteration we have the fractal of generation @xmath54 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the dsg and the tf are examples of exactly decimable fractals for which the fractal dimension , @xmath55 , and the spectral dimension , @xmath56 , are exactly known . while the fractal dimension relates the number of nodes inside a sphere to the radius of the sphere @xcite , the spectral dimension is obtained from the scaling of the eigenmodes of a given structure ( phonons for lattices , fractons for fractal substrates ) @xcite , most simply seen in the probability of a random walker to be ( still or again ) at the original site @xcite .    here , we have namely @xmath57 and @xmath58 for the dsg , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 for the tf .",
    "we recall that for the usual , translationally invariant lattices the spectral and fractal dimensions coincide with the euclidean dimension @xmath3 , namely @xmath61 for the chain , @xmath62 for the square lattice and so on . on the other hand , on fractal structures @xmath56 often replaces @xmath3 when dealing with dynamical and thermodynamical properties @xcite . also , for fractals @xmath63 and @xmath55 is smaller than the euclidean dimension of the embedding space , that is , 2 for dsg and tf .",
    "the ct is no fractal in the classical sense , since its growth with increasing generation is exponential .",
    "however , the ct is built in a hierarchical manner , analogous to the tf .",
    "we also notice that both , the tf and the ct , are trees ( and are hence devoid of loops ) and exhibit a large number @xmath64 of end nodes .",

    ", we can build up such structures by combining the dsg and euclidean lattices by means of cartesian products .",
    "in general , the cartesian product of two graphs @xmath77 and @xmath78 is a graph @xmath79 with the vertex set @xmath80 , and such that two nodes @xmath81 are adjacent if @xmath82 and @xmath83 , or @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the spectral dimension @xmath56 on the product graph @xmath23 is then the sum of the corresponding dimensions of the two initial graphs @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "we combine in this way the dsg with the chain @xmath88 , with the square lattice @xmath89 and with the cubic lattice @xmath90 , to obtain more complex structures displaying spectral dimensions approximately equal to @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "finally , it should be underlined that , dealing with such structures , the location of the target , i.e. the node @xmath8 , also ( quantitatively ) matters . in the numerical analysis of sec .",
    "[ sec : numerics ] we place the target on a peripheral site , which means , without loss of generality , the apex for the dsg , the leftmost site for the tf and an outmost site for the ct ( see fig.[fig : frattali ] ) .",
    "we expect that a peripheral position for the target site does not correspond to an optimal situation and , since a priori the target position is unknown , this choice prevents an overestimation of the probability of finding the target .",
    "let us consider the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) and denote the corresponding set of eigenstates and eigenvalues by @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively . now ,",
    "for large @xmath49 the contribution of @xmath96 to @xmath43 is negligible and the ground state @xmath97 is close to @xmath52 . on the other hand , as @xmath98",
    "the ground state is close to @xmath99 since the weight of @xmath40 is small and , from perturbation theory , we expect that @xmath42 is close to @xmath100 , i.e. to the first excited state of @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "as pointed out by childs and goldstone @xcite , there exists an intermediate range of @xmath49 where , for complete graphs and hypercubic lattices with dimension @xmath4 , @xmath17 switches from the ground state @xmath101 to the first excited state @xmath100 ; in the very same region of @xmath49 the target state @xmath18 switches from a state with large overlap with @xmath100 to the ground state @xmath102 .",
    "therefore , by varying @xmath49 , we can find a particular value for @xmath49 for which the hamiltonian @xmath43 can evolve the state @xmath17 into a state close to the target state @xmath19 .",
    "the existence and the narrowness of such a range for @xmath49 are crucial for a large success probability .",
    "as anticipated , the ctqw under study can yield effective results if the hamiltonian @xmath43 is able to rotate the state @xmath42 to a state with a large overlap with @xmath18 . for this to occur a first condition which needs to be fulfilled",
    "is that there exists an intermediate range of @xmath49 over which the state @xmath42 has a substantial overlap with both @xmath102 and @xmath100 . in this subsection",
    "the occurrence of such a condition is investigated analytically for an arbitrary structure , following arguments similar to those exploited in @xcite for @xmath3-dimensional hypercubic lattices ; the details of the calculations are given in appendixes a and b while here we just report the main results .",
    "first of all , we define @xmath103 and @xmath104 , the @xmath105-th eigenstate and eigenvalue of the laplacian @xmath40 , respectively . in the basis of the eigenstates",
    "@xmath103 the target site @xmath19 can be written as @xmath106 where @xmath107 .    as derived in appendix  [ appe1 ] , once latexmath:[$\\xi_j \\equiv \\sum_{k \\neq 0 }    @xmath42 with the ground state @xmath102 or with",

    "this is particularly interesting in the limit @xmath114 , when a level crossing from state @xmath102 to state @xmath100 can occur .",

    "we find a sufficient condition in the laplacian spectrum and , in particular , in appendix  [ appe2 ] we prove that such a condition holds for the dsg for which @xmath104 is exactly known @xcite ; in this case we find that @xmath122 and @xmath123 where @xmath124 is a parameter depending on the given network . in general ,",

    "@xmath126 , regardless of their dimension , while for the dsg we can numerically estimate @xmath124 as being @xmath127 ( see appendix  [ appe1 ] ) .",

    "we now consider the three examples of low - dimensional inhomogeneous structures described previously , for which the overlaps of the initial state @xmath17 and of the target state @xmath19 with @xmath132 and @xmath133 are shown in figs .",
