    "directed polymers in disordered media is a model of a variety of physical phenomena .",

    "is then defined in the usual gibbsian way by @xmath20 where @xmath5 is the inverse temperature , @xmath21 is the uniform measure on @xmath1-step walks , and @xmath22 the point - to - point partition function @xmath23.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the partition function @xmath24 is the sum of the point - to - point versions over @xmath25 .",
    "the random environment is a probability measure @xmath26 on the space of environments @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath26 be a product measure so that the variables @xmath28 are independent and identically distributed , and assume they have mean zero and variance one and @xmath29 .",
    "the goal is to study the behaviour of the model as @xmath0 and @xmath15 vary . at @xmath4",
    "the polymer measure is the simple random walk , hence the walk is entropy dominated and exhibits diffusive behaviour . for @xmath0 large the polymer measure",
    "concentrates on paths with low energy and the diffusive behaviour is no longer guaranteed . a more precisely defined separation between these two regimes",
    "is given in terms of the quenched and annealed free energies : @xmath30 weak disorder corresponds to equality and manifests itself through diffusive behavior . in the opposite , strong disorder case the system exhibits localization .",
    "the transition occurs at a critical @xmath31 . for @xmath32 and @xmath33 , @xmath34 , while @xmath35 for @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "we only consider @xmath37 .",
    "the behaviour of the polymer is described in terms of fluctuation exponents for the polymer endpoint and the free energy . for @xmath38-dimensional polymers",
    "there are long - standing predictions : for the polymer endpoint @xmath39 with @xmath40 for all @xmath0 ; for the free energy fluctuation exponent @xmath41 , with @xmath42 .",
    "observe that @xmath40 and @xmath42 satisfy the relation @xmath43 , which is expected to hold whenever there is localization .    for the free energy the limiting distribution of the fluctuations is the tracy - widom distribution @xcite corresponding to the gaussian unitary ensemble of random matrices , that is @xmath44 .",
    "in fact , a stronger statement holds for the point - to - point partition functions .",
    "after proper normalization the collection of partition functions parameterized by the renormalized target point @xmath25 converges to a universal stationary process called airy@xmath45 @xcite which has @xmath46 as its one - dimensional distributions .",

    "for very few environments of total probability on the order of @xmath53 , @xmath54 is on the order of @xmath55 .",
    "this explains the apparent discrepancy .",
    "the central focus of this paper is to describe these exponents and the limiting distributions in what we have termed an intermediate disorder regime , accessed by scaling @xmath0 as we increase the polymer length , @xmath56 the @xmath9 case is the much studied polymer measure , with predictions given on the previous page . for different values of @xmath3",
    "the `` @xmath8-polymers '' behave in ways that are quantifiably different from each other . in this sense",
    "the intermediate disorder regime is actually an entire family of regimes with @xmath8 as an indexing parameter .",
    "the value @xmath14 is critical and is also the most interesting ; it is described soon .",
    "for @xmath57 the polymer is diffusive and behaves as a simple random walk , with @xmath58 fluctuations of the path , i.e. @xmath59 , @xmath51 .",
    "the polymer , rescaled by @xmath58 , converges to brownian motion with diffusivity constant @xmath60 for almost all environments .",
    "also @xmath61 . for @xmath62",

    "this assumption means that most of the contribution to the fluctuations of the free energy comes from paths with an endpoint in a neighbourhood of @xmath74 .",
    "the logarithm of the number of such paths is @xmath75 ( by the normal approximation to simple random walk ) and from each path contributes energy on the order of @xmath76 $ ] to @xmath77 , so that the log of the point - to - point partition function at @xmath74 is @xmath78.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the polymer endpoint favors the value of @xmath74 which maximizes .",

    "hence @xmath83 which gives @xmath84 . substituting this back into implies that the fluctuations of the free energy are on the order of @xmath85 , which gives the formula for @xmath68 .",
    "the localization length exponent is determined by the condition that the difference between logarithms of the point - to - point partition function with endpoints separated by the localization length @xmath86 should be of order @xmath60 . for distances",

    "@xmath108 and @xmath109 are the airy functions @xcite .    for @xmath14",
    "the localization length is on the same order as the displacement of its endpoint @xmath110 .",
    "the polymer is not localized anymore and the latter argument breaks down .",
    "however the exponents are still correct .",
    "the scaling behavior in this critical case will be discussed in the next section .",
    "we verify the formulas for @xmath67 and @xmath68 by numerical simulations .",
    "we fix @xmath111 and let @xmath8 vary from @xmath112 to @xmath113 in increments of @xmath114 .",
    "exponents are computed for @xmath115 independent gaussian environments and polymers of length @xmath116 .",
    "see the figures for results .",
    "in the @xmath14 case the limiting distribution of the polymer endpoint is more involved but still computable .",
    "from @xmath117 we do not require any normalization . consider the modified partition function @xmath118.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] expanding the product and then applying the expectation with respect to the random walk yields @xmath119 , where @xmath120 here @xmath121 for random walks starting at zero , @xmath122 , and the sum is over ordered @xmath123 with @xmath124 , and free @xmath125 , @xmath126 , with @xmath127 .",
    "we compute that for fixed @xmath128 @xmath129 where @xmath130 here @xmath131 is a gaussian white noise on @xmath132 with @xmath133 = \\delta(t - s ) \\delta(x - y)$ ] , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and the integration is over @xmath136 with @xmath127 .",
    "the @xmath137 term is necessary to keep the variance of each term bounded , and the @xmath138 terms come from the local limit theorem for simple random walk . in the case",
    "@xmath139 the convergence is easily seen by a fourier transform computation .",

    "therefore the limiting distribution is normal with mean zero and variance @xmath145 , and it is easily checked that @xmath146 has the same distribution . for the @xmath147 terms",
    "the convergence is handled by the general theory of u - statistics @xcite .    from these computations",
    "we conclude that @xmath148 converges to the process @xmath149 .",
    "the same convergence also holds replacing @xmath150 by @xmath151 . define the process @xmath152",
    "it is very important that this process is universal , namely it appears as a limit for polymer models in the critical regime with an extremely general distribution for the random potentials @xmath142 .",
    "it is also easy to see that the statistics of the density of the scaled polymer endpoint @xmath153 is the same as the statistics of the random density @xmath154 .",
    "another important property of @xmath155 is that it interpolates between a gaussian process ( @xmath4 ) and the airy@xmath45 process ( @xmath156 ) . to see this crossover one has to properly rescale the process with @xmath0 to normalize the variance of its one - point distribution and its two - point correlation function at a fixed distance .",
    "the interpolation property follows from @xcite and @xcite , where an exact formula for the distribution of @xmath155 was calculated ( see also @xcite ) . using the tracy - widom formula for asymmetric simple exclusion @xcite",

    "it also follows that @xmath155 is stationary in @xmath25 as its distribution is independent of @xmath25 .",
    "finally , one can show that the process @xmath155 is continuous and locally brownian , i.e. @xmath165 is of order @xmath166 .",
    "the limiting distribution is also characterized @xcite by observing that @xmath167 is the wick exponential of a stochastic integral .",
    "let @xmath168 be a one - dimensional brownian motion that is independent of the white noise @xmath131 .",
