    "superstring theory in a flat ten  dimensional space  time can provide a framework to describe the elementary particles and their interactions including gravity beyond the standard model . the heterotic string theory , with its elegant inclusion of gauge symmetry , can naturally accommodate models with grand unification of the gauge interactions ( see for example @xcite ) , while the structure of yukawa couplings in the standard model can find a natural setting in type iia / iib superstring theory with d - branes ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "both scenarios , however , rest on a six  dimensional compact internal space whose volume and shape should be fixed or stabilized ( moduli stabilization ) . aside from the wide arbitrariness in the choice of vacuum ,",
    "this remains a difficult problem in string theory .",
    "in this paper we focus on the moduli stabilization problem in type iib theory , which has been extensively studied only in the low  energy effective field theory , the type iib supergravity , introducing three  form fluxes from massless modes of the corresponding closed string ( `` flux compactifications '' ) @xcite , while it is generally not accessible with string methods .",
    "therefore , it appears important to explore insofar as possible the actual predictions of string theory while keeping within the reach of conventional world ",
    "sheet theory .    a scenario without three  form fluxes was already proposed in type i theory @xcite .",
    "it rests on the magnetic flux of the d9-brane gauge field in orientifold models @xcite , and the basic idea of this scenario is simple .",
    "once the distribution of magnetic fluxes on d9-branes is fixed by supersymmetry conditions , or minimum energy conditions , volume and shape of the compact space can be fixed as a result of quantization conditions of magnetic fluxes . since magnetic fluxes on d - branes",
    "can be analyzed within conventional world ",
    "sheet theory , this type of scenario grants calculability .",
    "although it seems difficult to stabilize all moduli by this simple mechanism , it is therefore worth exploring this idea further .",
    "we investigate the volume stabilization of orbifold compact spaces with magnetic fluxes on d - branes in more general situations without supersymmetry .",
    "the d - branes are not necessarily space  time filling , while supersymmetry may be broken , for instance , by `` brane supersymmetry breaking '' @xcite while retaining , for the bulk , supersymmetric compactifications .",
    "in addition to the above idea related to magnetic fluxes , we examine volume stabilization ( khler moduli stabilization ) resulting from the balance of attractive and repulsive forces between d - branes in the compact space .",
    "we propose a mechanism that can in principle stabilize the volumes of some orbifold spaces with fixed shapes , and thus lacking complex ",
    "structure moduli , as for example @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ( see fig.[fig : balance ] for a schematic picture ) .",
    "orbifold and the three fixed points ( left ) . balance of the forces between three objects located at three different fixed points ( right ) . as a result ,",
    "the area of the fundamental region is fixed , or stabilized .",
    ", width=529 ]    in these contexts , mutual attractive forces could result from the simultaneous presence of d - branes and anti - d - branes , while in principle the non - bps - branes of @xcite and the fractional non - bps states of @xcite could provide additional repulsive contributions .    a concrete model whose compact space is stabilized by this scenario , even if incomplete , could allow a related discussion of early cosmology , and thus of cosmic inflation , within string theory . in particular , the fields describing brane displacements away from their balanced locations could play the role of inflatons , while the vacuum energy of balanced configurations could be the origin of dark energy . models of this type also possess the attractive feature of linking spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking in string theory to geometrical d - brane displacements , along the lines of @xcite .",
    "one might also conceive of turning the constraint that the compact internal space be stabilized , which is unavoidable in a strict sense , into a constructive principle to build realistic models of elementary particles and their interactions .    in this paper",
    "we concentrate on a compact six  dimensional orbifold of @xmath2 , which possesses three volume moduli ( untwisted khler moduli , corresponding to the areas of the three two  tori of @xmath3 ) , 81 blow  up moduli ( 3 twisted khler moduli for each of the 27 fixed points ) and no complex structure moduli .",
    "we investigate the behavior of d@xmath4- , d@xmath5- and d@xmath6-branes in this compact space , where the index identifies the d5-branes whose world ",
    "volumes _ include _ @xmath7-th torus , and the d7-branes whose world ",
    "volume _ do not include _ it . since the numbers of dirichlet  neumann directions of the open string stretched between d@xmath8- and d@xmath9-branes are not multiples of 4 , the system breaks supersymmetry and has a tachyonic ground state .",
    "however , as we shall see the inclusion of appropriate magnetic fluxes on d@xmath6-branes can make the system supersymmetric ( namely the lowest energy state ) while removing the tachyon instability ( see also the related work of @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , this configuration fixes the total volume of the first and second tori in the @xmath2 orbifold , the inclusion of a d3-brane pose an additional constraint on the magnetic flux on the d@xmath6-brane , so that finally the radii of the first and second tori are both fixed .",
    "the d3-brane should be located far enough from the d@xmath5-brane , in order to exclude tachyonic ground states for d@xmath4-d@xmath5 open strings .",
    "the magnetized d@xmath5-d@xmath6 system can be placed at a @xmath2 orbifold fixed point , while satisfying twisted ramond ",
    "ramond tadpole cancelation conditions for the consistency at the quantum level .",
    "the simplest system of this type with overall ramond ",
    "ramond tadpole cancelation involves a magnetized d@xmath5-d@xmath6 and its anti  system placed at two different orbifold singularities .",
    "if these are separated in the third torus , its radius is driven to shrink by mutual attractive forces , so that other objects are needed to stabilize the internal volume . in this paper",
    "we propose a non  trivial treatment of the tadpole problem , ubiquitous for d - branes in compact spaces , which can lead to this physically reasonable result .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ one - loop ]",

    "we shall see in detail that the vacuum energy vanishes for a certain configuration of magnetic fluxes , when the system possesses supersymmetry . the resulting configuration of magnetic fluxes stabilizes the overall volume of the first and second tori , while the inclusion of a d3-brane completes the stabilization of their radii . in section [ singularity ]",

    "we provide a summary of this work and briefly address some future problems .",
