    "` unavoidable complexes ' , introduced by blagojevi , frick , and ziegler in @xcite , play the fundamental role in their ` constraint method ' ( gromov - blagojevi - frick - ziegler reduction ) .",
    "inspired by @xcite , and in part developing some ideas from the unpublished preprint @xcite , here we begin a systematic study of ` unavoidable complexes ' , as combinatorial objects that may have some independent interest and which may deserve to be studied in their own right .",
    "the paper is focused on developing some new ideas and constructions which may provide additional insight into the general structure of ` unavoidable simplicial complexes ' .",
    "we begin with the observation that all known ` key examples ' of @xmath7-unavoidable complexes , used in the seminal paper @xcite ( lemma  4.2 ) , are ` linearly realizable ' ( threshold ) complexes , or contain such a complex as a subcomplex , see section  [ sec : key - examples ] ( and definitions  [ def : linear ] and [ def : simple ] in section  [ sec : threshold ] ) .",
    "for this reason one of the central themes in our paper is the construction of unavoidable complexes which are ` non - linear ' in some , precisely defined , sense ( see sections  [ sec : intrinsic ] and [ sec : lin - realiz ] ) .",
    "we introduce two natural and possibly new invariants of a simplicial complex @xmath9}$ ] , the _ partition number _ @xmath0 ( definition  [ def : pi - invariant ] ) and the _ threshold characteristic _ @xmath10 ( definition  [ def : threshold - char ] ) .",
    "the ` linearity ' or ` non - linearity ' of a complex @xmath6 is then rephrased as a statement about mutual relationship of @xmath0 and @xmath10 ( as exemplified by proposition  [ prop : vazna - implikacija ] and example  [ eqn : tight ] in section  [ sec : threshold - char ] ) .",
    "the fundamental relation between these two invariants is the inequality , @xmath11 ( proposition  [ prop : vazna - implikacija ] ) where the equality holds precisely if @xmath6 is an ` intrinsically linear complex ' ( see definition  [ def : simple ] and corollary  [ cor : char - simple ] ) .",
    "we say that @xmath6 is ` intrinsically non - linear ' ( definition  [ def : simple ] ) if the inequality in ( [ eqn : uvod - fund - ineq ] ) is strict , and one of our central objectives is to generate and study these complexes . especially interesting",
    "are ` strongly non - linear complexes ' ( definition  [ def : strong - intrinsic ] ) which are both intrinsically non - linear and minimal in the sense that @xmath12 for each proper subcomplex @xmath13 of @xmath6 .      theorem  [ thm : vazna-2 ] in section  [ sec : intrinsic ] describes a large class of strongly non - linear complexes , emphasizing the role of ( highly symmetric ) minimal triangulations of manifolds that ` look like a projective plane ' ( section  [ sec : look - alikes ] ) .",
    "one of the highlights of the paper is an algorithmic procedure for evaluating @xmath10 ( see propositions  [ prop : thr - char - min ] and [ prop : vazna - simetrija ] in section  [ sec : threshold - char ] ) , based on the ideas from linear programming , which is quite efficient if @xmath6 has a reasonably large symmetry group .",
    "this connection with polyhedral combinatorics turns out to be very fruitful and a more complete report of ( computer experiments and other results ) will appear elsewhere .    in order to evaluate ( estimate ) the partition invariant @xmath0 , we rely on the assumption that @xmath14 has a join decomposition , where @xmath15 is @xmath16-unavoidable for some @xmath17",
    ". one of our central results ( theorem  [ theo : join ] ) says that @xmath6 , as a subcomplex of @xmath18 where @xmath19 , is @xmath7-unavoidable provided @xmath20 .",
    "combined together , these ingredients ( the join decomposition @xmath14 of carefully chosen complexes @xmath21 with known partition number and a large group of automorphisms ) lead to the construction of ` intrinsically non - linear ' unavoidable complexes and ` strongly non - linear complexes ' ( section  [ sec : intrinsic ] ) .    the observation that the large symmetry group may be instrumental in detecting non - linear examples of unavoidable complexes , shifted our attention and focus to known examples of @xmath22-unavoidable ( self - dual ! ) complexes with large group of automorphisms .",
    "an immediate choice were the unique ( @xmath23-vertex ) minimal triangulation @xmath24 of the real projective plane , and the unique ( @xmath25-vertex ) minimal triangulation @xmath26 of the complex projective plane , together with the three element @xmath27-dimensional complex @xmath28 $ ] and the known non - isomorphic simplicial complexes associated with the quaternionic projective plane @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the threshold characteristic of these combinatorial ` projective planes ' is calculated in section  [ sec : look - alikes ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . the partition number @xmath0 , together with its relatives and more general versions @xmath30 and @xmath31 , is introduced in section  [ sec : partition ] . in section",
    "[ sec : reduction ] we briefly review the ` constraint method ' ( gromov - blagojevi - frick - ziegler reduction ) and the reduction based on ` sarkaria s inequality ' .",
    "these two reduction procedures have been successfully applied to theorems of tverberg - van kampen - flores type , and they serve as our primary motivation for studying unavoidable complexes . fundamental constructions ( pushdown , join , etc . ) and basic properties of @xmath7-unavoidable complexes , including the inequality @xmath32 ( corollary  [ cor : pi - join ] ) , are presented in section  [ sec : fundamental ] .",
    "threshold complexes and their manyfold relations with unavoidable complexes are studied in sections  [ sec : threshold ] and [ sec : threshold - char ] .",
