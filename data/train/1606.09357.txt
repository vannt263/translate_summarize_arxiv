    "einstein radii of typical galactic gravitational microlensing events are of order au . hence ,",
    "if lensing events are observed from a satellite in a solar orbit , the relative lens - source positions seen from the ground and from the satellite appear to be different , resulting in different light curves .",
    "combined analysis of the light curves observed both from the ground and from the satellite leads to the measurement of the microlens parallax vector @xmath6 @xcite , which is referred to as the `` space - based microlens parallax '' .",
    "measurement of @xmath6 is important because it enables one to constrain the mass @xmath7 and distance @xmath8 to the lensing object by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the angular einstein radius , @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the parallax of the lensed star ( source ) , and @xmath13 is the distance to the source .",
    "microlens parallaxes can be measured from the single platform of earth that is being accelerated by its orbital motion around the sun .",
    "although parallaxes of most lenses with known physical parameters were measured in this way , ground - based measurement of microlens parallaxes , referred to as annual microlens parallaxes , has limited applicability , primarily to the small fraction of long time - scale events caused by nearby lenses .",
    "therefore , space - based microlens parallax provides the only way to routinely measure microlens parallaxes for an important fraction of microlensing events .    in 2014 ,",
    "the 50-year old concept of the space - based microlens parallax measurement was realized by a microlensing program making use of the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xcite , which has a projected separation from the earth @xmath14 au .",
    "the principal goal of the program is determining the galactic distribution of planets by measuring microlens parallaxes and thereby estimating distances of the individual lenses @xcite . from combined observations both from the ground and from the _ spitzer _ telescope conducted in 2014 and 2015 seasons , the masses and distances of two microlensing planets were successfully determined @xcite .    besides planetary microlensing events , another important target lensing events of _ spitzer _ observations are those produced by binary objects , especially caustic - crossing binary - lens events .",
    "caustics in gravitational lensing phenomena refer to the positions on the source plane at which a point - source would be infinitely magnified . in reality ,",
    "source stars have finite sizes and thus lensing magnifications during caustic crossings deviate from those of a point source .",
    "detecting these finite - source effects enables one to measure the angular einstein radius @xmath10 , which is the other ingredient needed for the unique determinations of @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( see equation  [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the usefulness of _ spitzer _ observations in characterizing binaries was demonstrated by the microlens parallax measurements for two caustic - crossing binary - lens events @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present the analysis of the caustic - crossing binary - lens event ogle-2015-blg-0479 , which was simultaneously observed by ground - based telescopes and the _ spitzer space telescope _ in the 2015 season . by measuring both the lens parallax and the angular einstein radius , we are able to determine the mass and distance to the lens . in addition , we can constrain the complete orbital parameters of the lens thanks to the precisely measured microlens parallax by the _ spitzer _",
    "we also investigate modeling degeneracies by comparing the event with ogle-2014-blg-1050 @xcite , which is another caustic - crossing binary - lens event observed by _ spitzer _ with similar photometric precision , cadence , and coverage .",
    "the event ogle-2015-blg-0479 occurred on a star located in the galactic bulge field with coordinates @xmath15 , that corresponds to the galactic coordinates @xmath16 .",
    "it was discovered by the early warning system ( ews : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the ogle group on 2015 march 18 ( @xmath17 from survey observations conducted using the 1.3 m telescope located at las campanas observatory in chile .    on 2015",
    "may 13 ( @xmath18 , the event exhibited a sharp rise of the source brightness and the onset of this anomaly was announced to the microlensing community .",
    "such a rise in the light curve is a characteristic feature that occurs when a source star enters a caustic formed by a binary object . in response to the anomaly alert , the @xmath19fun collaboration @xcite conducted follow - up observations using the 1.0 m telescope at cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) in chile . after the sharp rise , the light curve exhibited a `` u''-shape brightness variation , which is a characteristic feature when the source moves inside of a binary caustic .",
    "caustics produced by binary lenses are closed curves , and thus a caustic exit was anticipated . on @xmath20 , the source brightness suddenly dropped , indicating that the source exited the caustic .",
    "the robonet collaboration and the mindstep consortium , who were watching the progress of the event , conducted intensive observations during the caustic exit using two 1.0 m telescopes of las cumbres observatory global telescope network ( lcogt ) located in south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) .",
    "thanks to the follow - up observations , the caustic exit was densely resolved .",
    "the event was also observed from space as a part of the _ spitzer _ microlensing program .",
    "the general description of the program and target selection protocol in 2015 season are given in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "_ spitzer _ observations were conducted for 37 days from 2015 june 8 ( @xmath21 ) to july 15 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the event was observed with a half - day cadence until june 18 ( @xmath23 ) , just after the caustic exit seen from the ground , and one - day cadence thereafter . from these observations ,",
    "a total of 59 data points were obtained .",
    "data from ground - based observations were processed using pipelines that are based on the difference image analysis method @xcite and customized by the individual groups @xcite .",
    "data from _ spitzer _",
    "observations were processed by using a photometry algorithm that is optimized for images taken by the infrared array camera of _ spitzer _ in crowded fields @xcite .    in figure  [ fig : one ] , we present the light curve of ogle-2015-blg-0479 .",
    "one finds that both light curves observed from the ground and from the _ spitzer _ telescope are characterized by distinctive caustic - crossing features .",
    "we note that both the caustic entrance and exit were captured by the ground - based data , while only the caustic exit was captured by the space - based data .",
    "the light curves observed from the ground and from the _ spitzer _ telescope exhibit a @xmath24 day offset between the times of the caustic exits , indicating that the relative lens - source positions are displaced by the parallax effect .",
    "another important characteristics of the light curves is that the duration between the caustic crossings in the ground - based light curve , @xmath25 days , comprises a significant fraction of the whole duration of the event ( @xmath26 days ) .",
    "this indicates that the source is likely to have crossed a big caustic formed by a binary lens with roughly equal mass components and a separation similar to the einstein radius corresponding to the total mass of the lens .",
    "this is further evidenced by the fact that the space - based light curve also exhibits a strong caustic - crossing feature that could not have been produced if the caustic were small compared to the displacement of the source trajectory by parallax effects .    in many respects ,",
    "ogle-2015-blg-0479 is similar to ogle-2014-blg-1050 @xcite , which is another caustic - crossing binary - lens event simultaneously observed from the ground and from the _ spitzer _ telescope .",
    "first , the light curves of both events exhibit distinctive caustic - crossing features with wide time gaps between the caustic - crossing spikes .",
    "second , the _ spitzer _",
    "data cover the caustic exit but miss the entrance for both events .",
    "third , both events have similar time scales and were covered with similar photometric precision and cadence .",
    "hence , it will be interesting to compare the results of analysis , particularly regarding the four - fold degeneracy that was identified to exist for ogle-2014-blg-1050 .",
    "see section 3 for more details about the degeneracy .",
    "light curves of single - mass lensing events obtained from both space- and ground - based observations yield four sets of degenerate solutions @xcite , which are often denoted by @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , where the former and latter signs in each parenthesis represent the signs of the lens - source impact parameters as seen from earth and from the satellite , respectively .",
    "this four - fold degeneracy occurs due to the fact that a pair of light curves resulting from the source trajectories seen from earth and from the satellite passing on the same side with respect to the lens , i.e. @xmath27 or @xmath28 solutions , are similar to the pair of light curves resulting from source trajectories passing on the opposite sides of the lens , i.e. @xmath29 or @xmath30 solutions . for the graphical presentation of the four - fold degeneracy ,",
    "see figure 2 of @xcite .    for well covered binary - lens events",
    ", it is expected that the degeneracy between the pair of @xmath27 and @xmath29 [ or @xmath28 and @xmath30 ] solutions are generally resolved due to the lack of lensing magnification symmetry compared to the single lens case .",
    "the remaining degeneracy , i.e. @xmath27 versus @xmath28 , may persists , but these solutions usually give similar amplitudes of the microlens parallax , and thus the physical lens parameters estimated from the two degenerate solutions are similar to one another . in the case of ogle-2014-blg-1050 , @xcite found that the four - fold degeneracy unexpectedly persisted and diagnosed that the degeneracy remained unresolved because ( 1 ) _ spitzer _ data partially covered the light curve and ( 2 ) the source - lens relative motion happened to be almost parallel to the direction of the binary - lens axis .",
    "similar to ogle-2014-blg-1050 , the _ spitzer _ data of ogle-2015-blg-0479",
    "cover only the caustic exit of the light curve , and thus the degeneracy may persist .",
    "we , therefore , investigate the possibility of the degeneracy .",
    "modeling the light curve of ogle-2015-blg-0479 is carried out in multiple steps :    1 .   preliminary modeling based on the ground - based data , 2 .   measuring the microlens parallax with combined ground- and space - based data , and 3 .   refining the identified solutions .    in the following paragraphs",
    ", we describe these in detail .    in the first step ,",
    "we conduct a preliminary modeling of the light curve obtained from ground - based observations in order to find an initial position in the parameter space from which @xmath32 minimization can be initiated .",
    "this preliminary modeling is based on the 7 principal binary lensing parameters plus 2 flux parameters for the data set obtained by each telescope .",
    "the first four of these principal parameters describe the lens - source approach , including @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , where @xmath33 is the time of the closest source approach to a reference position of the lens , @xmath34 is the source - reference separation at @xmath33 ( impact parameter ) , @xmath35 is the time scale for the source to cross the angular einstein radius @xmath10 of the lens ( einstein time scale ) , and @xmath36 is the angle between the source trajectory and the binary axis ( source trajectory angle ) .",
    "we choose the center of mass of the binary lens as the reference position .",
    "another 2 principal parameters characterize the binary lens including @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where @xmath37 is the projected separation and @xmath38 is the mass ratio between the binary lens components .",
    "we note that the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath37 are normalized to @xmath10 .",
    "the last parameter @xmath39 , which is defined as the ratio of the angular source radius @xmath40 to the einstein radius , i.e. , @xmath41 ( normalized source radius ) , is needed to account for the caustic - crossing parts of the light curve affected by finite - source effects .",
    "the two flux parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 represent the fluxes from the source and blended light , respectively .",
    "the principal lensing parameters are searched for by using a downhill approach based on the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method .",
    "the flux parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 are searched for by a linear fitting .",
    "magnifications affected by finite - source effects are computed by using a combination of numerical and semi - analytic methods . in the immediate neighboring region around caustics ,",
    "we use the numerical inverse - ray - shooting method @xcite . in the outer region",
    "surrounding caustics , we use the semi - analytic hexadecapole approximation @xcite .    in computing finite - source magnifications , we consider surface brightness variation of the source star caused by limb darkening by modeling the surface brightness profile as @xmath44 , \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the linear limb - darkening coefficient and @xmath46 is the angle between the normal to the source surface and the line of sight toward the center of the source star .",
    "the values of the limb - darkening coefficient are chosen from the catalog of @xcite based on the source type determined from the de - reddened color and brightness .",
    "we find that the source is an early k - type subgiant and adopt @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "for the detailed procedure of determining the source type , see section 4 .",
    "in the second step , we conduct another modeling including the _ spitzer _ data and considering parallax effects , starting from the solution found from the preliminary modeling .",
    "parallax effects are incorporated by two parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which are the two components of the lens parallax vector @xmath6 projected onto the sky along the north and east equatorial coordinates , respectively .",
    "the starting values of the lens parallax parameters @xmath49 and @xmath51 can be , in principle , estimated from the offsets in the values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 for the two light curves observed from the ground and from the _ spitzer _ telescope because the parallax vector is related to these offsets by @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is the projected separation between earth and the satellite . during the time of the event , @xmath56 au .",
    "however , this analytic estimation of the lens parallax vector is difficult because @xmath57 , and @xmath58 are uncertain due to the partial coverage of the event by the _ spitzer _ data .",
    "another way to obtain a starting @xmath59 value is conducting an additional modeling based on the ground - based data but this time considering the annual parallax effects , which affect the ground - based light curve via earth s annual orbital motion .",
    "we find that implementing this method is also difficult because the photometric data are not good enough and cadence of ground - based observation is not high enough to precisely measure @xmath6 based on subtle deviations caused by the annual parallax .",
    "we therefore conduct a grid search in the @xmath60 plane .",
    "in addition to finding a starting value of @xmath6 , this second - step grid search is needed to identify possibly multiple solutions resulting from the parallax degeneracy .    in the final step ,",
    "we identify local solutions found from the second - step grid search and refine them by letting all parameters vary . in this step ,",
    "we additionally consider the effect of lens orbital motion , which is known to induce long - term deviations in binary - lensing light curves similar to the deviation induced by parallax effects @xcite .",
    "orbital effects cause the projected binary separation @xmath37 and the source trajectory angle @xmath36 to vary in time . under the assumption that the orbital period @xmath61 is much greater than the event time scale , i.e.  @xmath62 , i.e. , @xmath63",

    ", the variations of @xmath37 and @xmath36 can be approximated to be linear and the lens - orbital effect is described by two parameters @xmath70 and @xmath71 that are the linear change rates of the projected binary separation and the source trajectory angle , respectively . for the full consideration of the kepler orbital motion , on the other hand , one needs two additional parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which represent the line - of - sight separation between the binary lens components and its rate of change , respectively .",
    "see @xcite for the full description of the orbital lensing parameters . in our analysis",
    ", we test both orbital models based on the linear approximation with 2 parameters and the full keplerian orbital motion with 4 parameters .",
    "in table  [ table : one ] , we present the lensing parameters of the solutions found from modeling .",
    "we present two sets of solutions with @xmath74 , i.e. , @xmath27 solution , and @xmath75 , i.e. , @xmath28 solution , because the degeneracy between the two solutions is very severe with @xmath76 .",
    "we note that the two degenerate solutions are in mirror symmetry with respect to the binary axis and thus the parameters of the solutions are in the relation @xmath77 .",
    "the uncertainty of each parameter is determined as the standard deviation of the distribution derived from the mcmc chain . in figure",
    "[ fig : one ] , we present the best - fit model light curve ( @xmath75 solution ) superposed on the observed data .",
    "the model curves for the ground- and space - based data sets are presented in different colors that are in accordance with those of the individual data sets .",
    "we find that the model based on the full keplerian orbital motion provides a better fit than the model based on the linear approximation with @xmath78 .    figure  [ fig : two ] shows the geometry of the lens system , where the left and right panels are for the @xmath74 and @xmath75 solutions , respectively .",
    "we note that the degeneracy between the @xmath74 and @xmath75 solutions , which is referred to as the `` ecliptic degeneracy '' @xcite , is known to exist for general binary - lens events . in each panel ,",
    "the red and blue curves with arrows represent the source trajectories seen from the ground and from space , respectively , and the closed curve with six cusps represents the caustic .",
    "we note that the shape of the caustic varies in time due to the orbital motion of the binary lens . from the geometry",
    ", it is found that the sharp spikes were produced by the crossings of the source over the single big caustic formed by a binary having a roughly equal mass ( @xmath79 ) components with a projected separation similar to the einstein radius ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "the source seen from the ground and from space took different trajectories where the space - based source trajectory trailed the ground - based trajectory with a time gap @xmath24 days and with a slightly different source trajectory angle .",
    "the weak bump at @xmath81 in the ground - based light curve was produced when the source approached the cusp of the caustic located on the binary axis close to the lower - mass binary component .",
    "we find that improvement of the fit with the consideration of the lens orbital motion is @xmath82 . in appendix",
    ", we discuss the false alarm probabilities associated with the introduction of the additional orbital - motion parameters relative to the standard model .",
    "although the degeneracy between @xmath74 and @xmath75 solutions persists , we find that the degeneracy between @xmath4 and @xmath5 solutions is clearly resolved . in figure",
    "[ fig : three ] , we present the lens system geometry and the model light curve corresponding to the @xmath29 local solution . we find that although the local solution explains the caustic - crossing features , the fit in the wings of the light curve is poor with @xmath32 difference from the @xmath28 solution @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , the result confirms that the four - fold degeneracy in single - lens events collapses into the two - fold degeneracy in general binary - lens events .",

    "the fact that the lens has a heavier mass than the most common lens population of low - mass stars and it is located relatively close to the observer makes us to consider the possibility that the origin of blended light is likely to be the lens itself . in order to check this possibility",
    ", we mark the position of the blend in the color - magnitude diagram presented in figure  [ fig : four ] .",
    "we also calculate the expected position of the lens based on the lens mass ( and corresponding stellar type ) and lens distance , as given in table  [ table : two ] .",

    "we note that the blend position is consistent with that expected for the lens provided the latter lies behind @xmath128 less extinction than the clump .",
    "that is , the lens would have to lie behind about 3/4 of the dust .",
    "this is quite reasonable given the lens distance of @xmath129kpc .",
    "the alternate possibility , i.e. , that the blend light comes primarily from an unrelated star along the line of sight , is virtually ruled out if the microlens model is correct .",
    "this is because , regardless of how much dust lies behind the lens , its inferred @xmath96-band flux already accounts for the majority of the observed blend light .",
    "hence , the room for other , unassociated , stars to contribute to the blend is highly restricted . with @xmath130 ,",

    "since the two components of the lens are moving with internal relative motion of order @xmath131 in both solutions , the orbit can be measured by making spectroscopic observations over a number of years .",
    "we analyzed the combined data obtained from observations both from the ground and from the _ spitzer _",
    "telescope for the microlensing event ogle-2015-blg-0479 . the light curves with strong caustic - crossing features seen from the ground and from space exhibited a time offset @xmath0 days between the caustic spikes , indicating that the relative lens - source positions seen the two places were displaced by parallax effects . from modeling the light curves , we measured the space - based microlens parallax .",
    "combined with the angular einstein radius measured by analyzing the caustic - crossing parts of the light curves , we determined the mass and distance of the lens .",
    "it was found that the lens was a binary composed of two g - type stars with masses @xmath1 and @xmath132 located at a distance @xmath3 kpc . unlike the binary event ogle-2014-blg-1050 observed also by _ spitzer _ with similar photometric precision , cadence , and coverage , we found that interpreting ogle-2015-blg-0479 did not suffer from the degeneracy between @xmath4 and @xmath5 solutions , confirming that the four - fold parallax degeneracy in single - lens events collapses into the two - fold degeneracy in general binary - lens events .",
    "it was found that the location of the blend in the color - magnitude diagram was consistent with the lens properties , suggesting that the blend was the lens itself .",
    "the blend is bright enough for spectroscopy and thus the possibility can be checked from future follow - up observations .",
    "the binary event ogle-2015-blg-0479 analyzed in this work demonstrates the possibility of characterizing the physical parameters of binary lenses for a significantly increased number of events .",

    "the chance to measure the angular einstein radius is high because of the greatly increased observation cadence of ground - based surveys achieved by the instrumental upgrade and the addition of new surveys , e.g. kmtnet survey @xcite .",

    "in principle , one can evaluate the false alarm probabilities ( faps ) associated with introducing either @xmath134 or @xmath135 orbital motion parameters relative to a so - called `` standard '' , i.e. , non - orbiting binary model , @xmath136^{-1}\\int_{\\delta\\chi^2/2}^\\infty dx x^{n/2 - 1}e^{-x } \\rightarrow \\biggl[\\sum_{i=0}^{n/2}{(\\delta\\chi^2/2)^i\\over i!}\\biggr ] \\exp(-\\delta\\chi^2/2 ) , \\label{eqn : fap}\\ ] ] where in the last step we have given the explicit expression for even @xmath137 . to evaluate these faps in a conservative fashion , we first renormalize that @xmath32 values in the main text so the @xmath138dof is exactly unity for the best model , i.e. , downward by a factor @xmath139",
    ". then @xmath140 and @xmath141 for @xmath134 and @xmath135 , respectively .",
    "the associated faps are then @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "these numbers are quite small , and one is tempted to leave it at that .",
    "however , there is actually a deeper issue at stake , which is that it is fundamentally wrong to evaluate faps for this case . to understand why , we briefly recapitulate a case for which such evaluation is appropriate .",
    "this will allow us to contrast the key features of the two cases .",
    "suppose that a microlensing event is reasonably well fit by a point - lens model with 3 parameters @xmath144 but is better fit by adding four additional parameters @xmath145 , with @xmath146 , indicating a planet . without going into detail ( because this is not our main focus ) , one can show that the fap is approximately given by @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the fraction of all point - lens events with suitable quality data that show planetary anomalies and @xmath149hr is the timescale of the shortest detectable planetary anomaly .",
    "the last factor accounts for the @xmath32 distribution associated with 2 additional parameters @xmath150 , while the first three count the effective number of trials .",
    "the first quantifies how many events are searched for each real planet .",
    "the second quantifies the number of independent locations along the light curve ( effectively parameterized by @xmath36 ) at which one can search for planets . and the third counts the number of independent durations of this perturbation at fixed location ( effectively parameterized by @xmath38 ) . for typical einstein timescales @xmath151days ,",
    "the first three factors combine to a value @xmath152 .",
    "now , such faps are never calculated in practice for the simple reason that no one has ever considered a microlensing planet to be `` detectable '' unless @xmath153 @xcite , and in fact all reported detections have had substantially higher @xmath154 . even at the putative threshold of detection",
    ", however , the fap is @xmath155 . the reasons for this conservative attitude do not concern us here , but the interested reader can consult @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our focus is rather on a matter of principle .",
    "a planet with mass ratio @xmath156 yields an absolutely identical model light curve as a point lens .",
    "hence , if we `` measure '' a mass ratio @xmath157 , we do not say that we have `` detected a planet , possibly of zero mass '' . rather , we formulate this as an upper limit on the mass of any possible planet that is present ( at a given @xmath158 ) . on the other hand , if the `` measurement '' were @xmath159 , then we would think naively that we may have detected a planet and might ask questions about the fap .",
    "( as mentioned in the previous paragraph , no such `` detection '' would ever be considered , but if it were , then inserting @xmath160 , one finds that the fap would exceed unity ! )      ogle-2015-blg-0479 shows two clear caustic crossings , and there are no known astrophysical phenomena that can generate such light curve features except having two masses projected on the sky within of order one einstein radius of each other .",
    "these two masses must either be bound to each other ( and so in a kepler orbit ) or are unbound , i.e. , merely seen in projection , in which case they are moving relative to each other in rectilinear , unaccelerated motion .",
    "( the probability of the latter is quite low , as we discuss immediately below ) . in either case",
    ", one knows a priori that they have some instantaneous relative motion .",
    "hence , one is not `` adding parameters '' to include such motion ( @xmath161 and @xmath71 in the formulations in the main text ) .",
    "rather , the opposite is true : if one were to model this  or any  binary system ( bound or unbound ) without including transverse relative velocity parameters , one would be suppressing the impact of known physics on the light curve and so , possibly , introducing systematic errors on the remaining parameters being measured .    in particular , if this measurement showed a best fit of zero relative motion ( or consistent with zero motion at low @xmath154 ) , we would not say ( as with @xmath162 in the planet case ) that we had failed to measure transverse motion .",
    "still less would we say that there was `` no justification '' for introducing transverse - velocity parameters .",
    "rather , we would say that we had _ measured _ the transverse velocity to be close to zero . and",
    "this measurement would be quite important because it would provide additional evidence that the system is bound .",
    "that is , the probability of finding two unrelated stars projected within about one einstein radius is already low , but the probability that they are moving slowly with respect to each other is yet another factor @xmath163 lower . the first probability is roughly the optical depth to microlensing , i.e. , @xmath164 .",
    "this might seem too small to consider , but since there have been more than 20,000 microlensing events discovered to date , the probability of such a chance projection in one of these is a few percent .",
    "hence , the additional suppression factor of @xmath163 from measuring a small transverse motion can be important .",
    "once the binary is demonstrated to be bound with very high probability , it is certainly justified to `` introduce '' the remaining two parameters needed to describe a full kepler orbit .",
    "we have put `` introduce '' in quotes because nothing is being introduced : rather we are simply not eliminating parameters that are known to be required to describe the physical system .",
    "[ [ when - is - one - justified - in - eliminating - some - or - all - kepler - parameters ] ] when is one justified in eliminating some or all kepler parameters ?",
    "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    from a purist standpoint , the answer is never .",
    "the practical reason that these `` extra '' parameters are frequently excluded is that in many cases nothing would be measured by doing so .",
    "for example , in many cases one finds that the transverse motion is consistent with zero but is equally consistent with values several times higher than permitted for bound orbits .",
    "since , as just mentioned , the prior probability for bound orbits is quite high , such a `` measurement '' yields no information .",
    "one is then tempted to simply set this motion to zero , i.e. , fit the data without these two parameters . and",
    "for many years this is exactly what was done .",
    "however , such an approach is unphysical : binary stars do not `` stand still '' .",
    "furthermore , as first shown by @xcite and then further elaborated by @xcite , if the transverse motion parameters are arbitrarily set to zero , then this can introduce systematic errors into the parallax parameters , with which they are correlated .",
    "rather the correct approach is to maintain these parameters . then if they take on improbable or unphysical values , the proper way to handle this is to introduce bayesian priors on these parameters .",
    "see , for example , @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the light curve does not contain enough information to fruitfully constrain either the transverse motion parameters or the parallax parameters , then setting these to zero is in most cases an appropriate way to simplify the fitting , since the remaining parameters are usually not strongly correlated with them .",
