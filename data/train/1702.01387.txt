    "owing to this factorizability , the maps @xmath18 and @xmath19 transform a classical state into another classical one .",
    "a mixture of coherent states has a wigner function @xmath20 with the probability density @xmath21 for a coherent state @xmath16 ( @xmath22 ) . applying each dm leads to @xmath23= \\int d^{2 } \\beta q_{1 } ( \\beta_{x } ) q_{j } ( \\beta_{y } ) w_{{| \\beta \\rangle \\langle \\beta | } } ( x , y )      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are nonnegative .",
    "the resulting distributions in eq .",
    "[ eq : wc2 ] also represent a certain mixture of coherent states , hence a physical state .",
    "therefore , if an unphysical wigner function emerges under our dms , the input state must be nonclassical .",

    "this method , of course , succeeds only when the observed marginal distribution is along a squeezed axis that generally extends to a finite range of angles , if not the whole angles @xcite .",
    "we can further make the test successful _ regardless of quadrature axis _ by introducing a random phase rotation on a gaussian state @xcite .",
    "note that a mixture of phase - rotations , which transforms a gaussian to a non - gaussian state , does not create nonclassicality , so the nonclassicality detected after phase rotations is attributed to that of the original state .",

    "every finite - dimensional state ( fds ) in fock basis , i.e. @xmath33 is nonclassical , since all coherent states ( except vacuum ) , and their mixtures as well , have an extension to infinite fock states .",
    "it is nontrivial to demonstrate the nonclassicality of fds when one has access to limited information , e.g. , a noisy state @xmath34 for @xmath35 has no simple signatures of nonclassicality like squeezing and negativity of wigner function .",
    "we prove that our dms are able to detect all non - gaussian states in finite dimension of any size , with details in sec .",

    "the essence of our proof is that there always exists a submatrix of the density operator corresponding to dms , which is not positive - definite .",
    "remarkably , this non - positivity emerges for a marginal distribution along an arbitrary direction , which means that the nonclassicality of fds is confirmed regardless of the quadrature axis measured , just like the phase - randomized gaussian states introduced in @xcite .",
    "this makes our dm test experimentally favorable , while the degree of negativity may well depend on the quadrature axis except rotationally - symmetric states .",
    "our criteria can further be extended to non - gaussian states in infinite dimension , particularly those without squeezing effect @xcite . as an illustration",

    "@xcite , single - mode nonclassicality is characterized by entanglement potential via a bs setting , where a vacuum is used as an ancillary input to bs to generate entanglement .",
    "we may take negativity , instead of logarithmic negativity in @xcite , as a measure of entanglement potential , i.e. , @xmath59 \\equiv \\frac{|| [ \\hat{u}_{\\mathrm{bs } } ( \\rho_{1 } \\otimes { | 0 \\rangle \\langle 0 |}_{2 } ) \\hat{u}_{\\mathrm{bs}}^{\\dag } ] ^{\\mathrm{pt } } ||_{1 } - 1}{2},\\ ] ] where @xmath60 and @xmath61^{\\mathrm{pt}}$ ] represent 50:50 beam - splitter operation and partial transpose on the mode 2 , respectively .",

    "<S> the resulting fictitious wigner function becomes unphysical only for a nonclassical state , thus the negativity of the corresponding density operator provides an evidence of nonclassicality . </S>",

    "<S> we experimentally illustrate the power of our criterion for motional states of a trapped ion confirming their nonclassicality in a measurement - axis independent manner . </S>",
    "<S> we also address an extension of our approach combined with phase - shift operations , which leads to a stronger test of nonclassicality , i.e. detection of genuine non - gaussianity under a cv measurement .    </S>",
    "<S> nonclassicality is a fundamentally profound concept to identify quantum phenomena inaccessible from classical physics . </S>",
    "<S> it also provides a practically useful resource , e.g. entanglement , making possible a lot of applications in quantum information processing beyond classical counterparts @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a wide range of quantum systems , e.g. field amplitudes of light , collective spins of atomic ensembles , and motional modes of trapped ions , bose - einstein condensate and mechanical oscillators , can be employed for quantum information processing based on continuous variables ( cvs ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is of crucial importance to establish efficient and reliable criteria of nonclassicality for cv systems , desirably testable with less experimental resources , e.g. fewer measurement settings @xcite and with the capability of detecting a broad class of nonclassical states . in this paper , in view of the glauber - sudarshan p - function @xcite , those states that can not be represented as a convex mixture of coherent states are referred to as nonclassical .    a standard method to obtain information on a cv quantum state is to measure marginal distributions along many different axes in phase space constituting quantum state tomography @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this tomographic reconstruction may reveal nonclassicality to some extent , e.g. negativity of wigner function making only a subset of whole nonclassicality conditions . </S>",
    "<S> however it typically suffers from a legitimacy problem , i.e. , the measured distributions do not yield a physical state when directly employed due to finite data and finite binning size @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> much efforts was made to employ estimation methods finding a most probable quantum state closest to the obtained data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there were also numerous studies to directly detect nonclassicality , e.g. an increasingly large number of hierarchical conditions @xcite requiring information on two or more marginal distributions or measurement of many higher - order moments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an exception would be the case of gaussian states , with its nonclassical squeezing demonstrated by the variance of distribution along a squeezed axis .    </S>",
    "<S> here we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a simple , powerful , method to directly manifest nonclassicality by observing a _ single _ marginal distribution applicable to a wide range of nonclassical states . </S>",
    "<S> our approach makes use of a phase - space map that transforms the marginal distribution ( obtained from measurement ) to a factorized wigner distribution by multiplying the same distribution or the vacuum - state distribution along an orthogonal axis . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to those mathematical procedures as demarginalization maps ( dms ) , since a 1-dimensional marginal distribution is converted to a fictitious 2-dimensional wigner function . </S>",
    "<S> the same method can be applied equally to the characteristic function as well as the wigner function . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a classical state , i.e. a mixture of coherent states , must yield a physical state under our dms . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the unphysicality emerging under dms is a clear signature of nonclassicality . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , for all non - gaussian states in finite dimensional space @xcite , our test works for an arbitrary single marginal distribution thus experimentally favorable . </S>",
    "<S> it also extends to non - gaussian states in infinite dimension , particularly those without squeezing effect . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a quantitative measure of nonclassicality using our dms , which provides a lower bound of entanglement potential @xcite  an entanglement measure under a beam - splitter setting versatile for cv entanglement generation @xcite . along this way </S>",
    "<S> , our method makes a rigorous connection between single - mode nonclassicality and negative partial transpose ( npt ) entanglement @xcite , which bears on entanglement distillation @xcite and nonlocality @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> as the measurement of a marginal distribution is highly efficient in various quantum systems , e.g. homodyne detection in quantum optics , our proposed approach can provide a practically useful and reliable tool in a wide range of investigations for cv quantum physics . </S>",
    "<S> we here experimentally illustrate the power of our approach by manifesting nonclassicality of motional states in a trapped - ion system . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we confirm the nonclassicality regardless of measured quadrature axis by introducing a simple faithful test using only a subset of data points , not requiring data manipulation under numerical methods unlike the case of state reconstruction . </S>",
