    "the purpose of this work was to find a generalization of the spherical infall model as developed by hoffman & shaham ( 1985 , hereafter hs ) to the case of density peaks collapsing in the weakly nonlinear background .",
    "one of the key assumptions underlying the calculations of hs was that the matter influenced by the peak collapses onto it undisturbed by the background .",
    "this is equivalent to the statement that the peak identified with some resolution ( smoothing ) scale collapses while the surrounding density field is still linear i.e. its rms fluctuation at this scale is much smaller than unity .",
    "the example of the virgo supercluster ( which has not yet collapsed ) shows that this is not always the case : the rms fluctuation at the scale of the supercluster is well in the weakly nonlinear regime .    in this generalization",
    "we hope to account properly for the weakly nonlinear transition between the linear and strongly nonlinear phase of the evolution of the perturbation which lacked in the approach of hs .",
    "it involves constructing the weakly nonlinear probability distribution function ( pdf ) of density around an overdense region . the mean density obtained from this weakly nonlinear pdf",
    "is then taken as the initial condition for spherical collapse .",
    "the reliability of this approach rests on the assumption that the influence of the neighbouring fluctuations can be restricted to the weakly nonlinear phase with its only outcome in the form of a changed ` initial ' density profile which then evolves independently of surroundings , according to the spherical model .",
    "we consider density contrast field which initially has gaussian distribution with zero mean .",
    "the field measured at a given point is denoted by @xmath0 while the one measured at the distance @xmath1 from the first point is called @xmath2 .",
    "we smooth the fields with gaussian filters of the same scale @xmath3 so their variances are equal @xmath4 .",
    "we generalize the joint probability distribution function for density contrast field in the gaussian case to the case when the density fields are weakly nonlinear and therefore departing from gaussianity . if the rms fluctuations of the fields are small ( below unity ) the fields can be expanded around their linear values @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the resulting two - point pdf takes the form of the bivariate edgeworth series ( okas 1997 ) .",
    "let us now suppose that the value of one variable is known : @xmath7 , i.e. at @xmath8 we have a region of @xmath9 standard deviations .",
    "the conditional probability distribution of the normalized density @xmath10 at distance @xmath1 from this region is well characterized by its lowest order moments with respect to the mean value , @xmath11 . in the gaussian case we have @xmath12 and @xmath13 , while in the weakly nonlinear approximation we get ( okas 1997 ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the correlation coefficient and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the one - point and two - point skewness parameters respectively .",
    "it turns out that for gaussian smoothing , scale - free power spectra @xmath18 with indices @xmath19 we have @xmath20 .",
    "this proves that according to equation ( [ l27 ] ) for @xmath21 ( peaks ) the correction to the mean normalized density contrast with respect to the gaussian value is always negative .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows that the effect of weakly nonlinear interactions is to decrease the expected density around an overdense region . in the case of the variance ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) the weakly nonlinear corrections work in the opposite direction :",
    "their effect is to increase the value of the variance ( or dispersion ) with respect to the linear case , because for the power spectra considered here we always have @xmath22 .",
    "it is clear that a local density peak that rises significantly above the noise should gravitationally dominate its surroundings out to some distance .",
    "a reasonable measure of the distance , up to which a coherent structure around the peak is expected , is the scale @xmath23 at which @xmath24 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows that the coherence scale in weakly nonlinear regime is decreased with respect to the linear case .",
    "the dynamical evolution of matter at the distance @xmath25 from the peak is determined by the mean cumulative density perturbation within @xmath26 which in weakly nonlinear approximation preserves its slope @xmath27 for large @xmath26 but the height of the peak instead of the linear value @xmath9 can be approximated by @xmath28 $ ] , where @xmath29 is of the order of unity . if we now assume that the matter within distance @xmath26 from the peak collapses undisturbed onto the peak , the spherical model can be applied . following the calculations of hs with the initial conditions settled by the edgeworth approximation instead of the gaussian one we find the final density profile to be given by @xmath30^{4}}{(n+4)(c_{0}/c_{i})^{n+3 } - 1 } ,      \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\",
    "c_{i}/c \\propto ( c_{0}/c_{i})^{n+3 } - 1\\ ] ] which has the same form as that of hs ( so that the limiting cases @xmath31 for @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath34 are preserved ) but the scale from which the peak gathers mass ( the distance to the shell of zero energy ) is decreased with respect to the linear case @xmath35.\\ ] ] the value of @xmath36 determines the slope of the profile ( [ l43 ] ) , the shorter @xmath36 the steeper is the density profile .",
    "the value of @xmath36 is defined so that in flat universe it is infinite therefore in this case the weakly nonlinear corrections do not affect the final profile . in the open universe ,",
    "however , the correction to @xmath36 is significant and leads to the steepening of the final profile and decreasing the mass bound to the peak ."
