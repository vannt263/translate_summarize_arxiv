    "understanding electronic transport in quantum dots remains a major challenge for theorists working on correlated electron systems .",
    "conductance at low energies is often dominated by one of a number of kondo effects,@xcite in which the strong localized interactions on the dot(s ) induce non - trivial many - body physics . over the years a wide range of such kondo effects",
    "have been predicted and observed , in single and multiple quantum dot devices of various geometries.@xcite    here we consider a single quantum dot , tunnel - coupled to two leads@xcite in an effective one - channel fashion . while the dot will in general hold many electrons in its quantized levels , only those close to the fermi level contribute in practice to electronic transport provided the mean level spacing is sufficiently large , and the rest can be neglected with relative impunity .",
    "typically just one level is important , but occasionally one observes the case of two relevant levels , where the physics is richer ; including e.g. a quantum phase transition between fermi liquid and underscreened kondo phases@xcite which has been observed in several experimental guises.@xcite    we present and examine critically a number of results falling under the umbrella of magnetic field ( @xmath3 ) effects in these single- and two - level quantum dots , the appropriate models for which are specified in sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] .",
    "the paper consists of two related parts . in the first ( secs .",
    "[ sec : zerofield],[sec : statdynam ] ) , using mainly wilson s numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) method,@xcite we consider magnetization , single - particle dynamics and the zero - bias conductance , with emphasis on the universality and scaling behavior arising in the strongly correlated regimes of the models .",
    "even for single - level quantum dots described by an anderson impurity model,@xcite there are still open questions regarding single - particle dynamics in the presence of a magnetic field ; our primary concern being the field - induced kondo peak splitting in the equilibrium single - particle spectrum .",
    "this has been analyzed by a number of authors and techniques,@xcite but the results are not in complete agreement.@xcite we show that there exists an algorithm by which nrg can obtain the universal behavior over many orders of magnitude of field strength but that , eventually , even the most accurate nrg calculations can not completely resolve the universal splitting at very large fields .",
    "the corresponding situation for the two - level model is considered in sec .",
    "[ ssec : dynam ] .",
    "we also obtain the field and temperature ( @xmath4 ) dependence of the zero - bias conductance , and for @xmath5 in particular generalize the luttinger integral analysis of ref .",
    "to encompass a finite magnetic field ; leading to an exact result for the conductance for any field , and insight into the rather subtle differences between the limits @xmath6 and @xmath7 for the underscreened triplet phase of the model .    in the second part of the paper ( sec .",
    "[ sec : experiment ] ) we turn to comparison with experiment .",
    "two recent sets of conductance measurements on quantum dots in a magnetic field are considered , from the groups of kogan@xcite ( on an effective one - level dot ) and goldhaber - gordon@xcite ( on both effective one- and two - level systems ) . from comparison to nrg results , we are able to determine reliable bare model parameters for the anderson - type ( as opposed to kondo ) models considered in secs .  [ sec : models ] - [ sec : statdynam ] , as relevant to experiment . with these , our nrg calculations are shown to yield very good qualitative agreement with essentially all features observed in both experiments.@xcite in particular , we show that theory can in fact explain the evolution of the field - induced splitting of the kondo conductance peak observed in ref .    including a simple explanation for an observed crossing in the peak splittings of two different quantum dots .",
    "the agreement is essentially quantitative up to field strengths of around a couple of kondo scales , but beyond that our calculations deviate from the experimental data .",
    "this reinforces results from a recent study using the scattering states nrg@xcite and earlier renormalized perturbation theory and nrg calculations,@xcite showing that the commonly used approximation of calculating the source - drain bias dependence of the conductance from the equilibrium spectrum is unsuitable for making quantitative comparisons to experiment sufficiently far out of equilibrium .",
    "indeed , until more progress in non - equilibrium theory is made , we suggest that experiments should instead aim to make comparison with the magnetic - field dependence of the zero - bias conductance .",
    "each model considered in this work consists of a single interacting quantum dot region , tunnel coupled to a pair of non - interacting metallic leads . as mentioned above , we focus on the situation where the mean level spacing of the dot is sufficiently large compared to the dot - lead tunneling strength that generally only one , or occasionally two , levels are involved in transport .",
    "when just one dot level is relevant the standard model is the anderson impurity model ( aim).@xcite here the dot itself is described by @xmath8 where @xmath9 counts the @xmath10 spin electrons on the dot level , @xmath11 is the on - level coulomb replusion / charging energy , and @xmath12 the level energy .",
    "the latter includes a zeeman coupling to an external magnetic field @xmath3 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 for @xmath15-spin electrons . in the case of two relevant dot levels ,",
    "the dot hamiltonian is naturally more complex .",
    "we choose to work with the following two - level model ( 2lm ) @xmath16 which has previously been shown to capture the key physics of two - level quantum dots in the absence of a magnetic field.@xcite here @xmath17 is the total number operator for level @xmath18 ( = 1,2 ) , and @xmath19 is the local spin operator with components @xmath20 ( @xmath21 are the pauli spin-@xmath0 matrices ) .",
    "in addition to the on - level coulomb repulsion @xmath11 ( taken to be identical for levels 1 and 2 for simplicity ) , the model includes an interlevel coulomb repulsion @xmath22 plus a ferromagnetic ( hund s rule ) exchange coupling of the spins of the two levels , parameterized by @xmath23 .    in each case , the dot hamiltonian is supplemented by coupling to two equivalent , noninteracting ` left ' and ` right ' leads , themselves described by @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , where the most general tunnel coupling to the leads is of form @xmath26 ( the sum over level index @xmath18 involving just @xmath27 in the case of the aim ) .",
    "the @xmath28 and @xmath29 lead chemical potentials are @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively , such that for @xmath32 a non - zero current flows .    analyzing the interacting models out of equilibrium",
    "is a formidable task ( see e.g. ref .",
    "for a recent discussion ) and in practice we consider the equilibrium situation .",
    "this has an immediate benefit , for the aim hamiltonian then reduces exactly to an effective one - lead model by defining @xmath33 with @xmath34 ( with @xmath27 ) , since the corresponding orthogonal combination of lead states is entirely decoupled from the dot .",
    "the two - level dot hamiltonian under this transformation does not generally separate so pristinely : excepting the special case of @xmath35 , @xmath36 , the dot remains coupled to two leads.@xcite however , over a wide range of parameter space the second lead couples sufficiently weakly that it may in practice be neglected on energy scales of practical interest.@xcite as such , for both the aim and 2lm we work with the effective one - lead description embodied in @xmath37 with @xmath38 for the aim and @xmath39 for the 2lm .    we consider the standard case@xcite of a symmetric , flat - band lead of half - width @xmath40 and density of states per orbital @xmath41 , and take @xmath42 .",
    "the dot - lead coupling is then embodied in the hybridization strength @xmath43 ( with @xmath44 the total density of states , and @xmath45 the number of lead orbitals ) .",
    "when presenting results , we use dimensionless parameters defined in terms of @xmath46 , viz .",

    ": first the splitting of the kondo peak with field was extracted from the experimental data and plotted versus @xmath3 .",
    "it was found that half the splitting tends to the form @xmath397 at high field ( with @xmath398 ) .",
    "direct comparison was then made between the full field - dependence of the splitting obtained from several theories , and experiment .",
    "we point out that there are two basic problems with making this comparison .",
    "first and foremost , if one is interested in the _ universal _ form of the kondo splitting , the experimental parameters need to satisfy both @xmath88 and @xmath399 .",
    "the former condition is necessary to ensure that the experiment is well - described by an effective kondo model at low energies , and arises because the schrieffer - wolff transformation that maps the full anderson model onto the kondo model is formally valid in the asymptotic limit @xmath88 .",
    "the latter condition defines what is meant here by ` low energies ' : even if @xmath80 is large , the effective kondo description will always break down at energies of the order of the non - universal scale @xmath46 , and the results on such an energy scale will simply not show universal kondo form .    one could argue that the @xmath400 here is sufficiently large for the experiment to be well described by a kondo model at zero field , although we believe this to be a somewhat more borderline case .",
    "the main problem however is that the experimental @xmath11 and @xmath46 are too small for the high - field results to be universal .",
    "this can in fact be seen directly from fig .",
    "2(d ) of ref .",
    "( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : anddc](b , d ) ) : even at moderate fields of @xmath247@xmath401 the kondo ( ` zeeman ' ) peaks are already overlapping significantly the non - universal coulomb peaks .",
    "more formally , to be universal for some given @xmath137 requires @xmath402 ; the experimental @xmath403,@xcite and @xmath404 as above , whence @xmath405 when @xmath406 .",
    "the second problem is that the predictions for the theoretical conductance@xcite have all been made using ( either explicitly or implicitly ) the approximation of eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : gcvsd ] ) , rather than from a full - blown non - equilibrium approach . even when we use the appropriate non - universal parameters in our nrg calculations , the comparison to both the present experiment and that of the previous section suggests that eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : gcvsd ] ) is quantitatively reliable only for fields smaller than a few kondo scales,@xcite and even then is strongly dependent on the value of @xmath341 . until non - equilibrium approaches such as the scattering - states",
    "nrg@xcite become more feasible , the quantitative , universal form of the conductance splitting for @xmath407 is an open question ; one should certainly not expect _ a priori _ to obtain quantitative agreement between experiment and eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : gcvsd ] ) .",
    "finally we consider the effect of magnetic field on the conductance of the two - level model , eqn .",
    "( [ eqn:2levdot ] ) , to make comparison with the spin-@xmath1 kondo valley experiments of ref . .",
    "since there are more interactions in the two - level hamiltonian than the aim , it is obviously harder to parameterize the model from the available data in a fully systematic manner .",
