    "data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have revealed abundant examples of streams and substructure in the milky way halo .",
    "for example , @xcite used a simple colour cut @xmath1 to map out the distribution of stars in sdss data release 5 ( dr5 ) .",
    "the `` field of streams '' , an rgb - composite image composed of magnitude slices of the stellar density of these stars , showed the leading arm of the well - known sagittarius stream and the monoceros ring very clearly .",
    "also prominent was a new stream , which did not have an identified progenitor , and was called the orphan stream by  @xcite .",
    "the orphan stream was then analysed independently by two groups .",
    "@xcite reported that there was a diminutive galactic satellite that lay near the projected path of the new stream but that it was `` unlikely to be related to it '' .",
    "@xcite disagreed , noting that the diminutive satellite lay on the same galactocentric great circle as the orphan stream .",
    "they argued that there was a preponderance of unusual objects along this great circle  including the complex a high velocity clouds and the young halo globular clusters ruprecht 106 and palomar 1  and suggested that some or all may be the remnants of the disruption of a dwarf galaxy .",
    "then , @xcite provided follow - up subaru imaging of the diminutive satellite , confirming it as a disrupted dwarf galaxy and naming it ursa major ii ( uma  ii ) after its host constellation .",
    "one possible interpretation of the data is that uma  ii is the progenitor of the orphan stream .",
    "closely related is the possibility that both uma  ii and the orphan stream are remnants from the break - up of a still larger object , perhaps a tidal dwarf galaxy  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this theoretical study",
    ", we strengthen the case for such interpretations by providing an orbit for the disruption of uma  ii so that its tidal tails match the observational data available on the orphan stream .",
    ".positions , distance moduli , distances and heliocentric velocities of the orphan stream from belokurov et al .",
    "( 2006b ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     another advantage of the one - component model is that there is some substructure in the uma  ii remnant , as is visible in the upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : umacomp ] . in the simulation , this is caused by tidal shocking of the remnant at the last few disk passages .",
    "the substructure is qualitatively similar to internal clumpiness of the uma  ii dsph seen by @xcite .",
    "however , to recover the details of this feature may well require a more elaborate starting model than a simple plummer sphere .",
    "the two - component model shows no substructure at the end of the simulation .",
    "both simulations not only match all the available positional data , but  more strikingly  they also explain why the tails around uma  ii are faint and undetectable with sdss . at the positions of the orphan stream ,",
    "projection effects enhance the visibility of the well - collimated stream , which lies almost along the line of sight . by contrast , at uma  ii the orbit is almost transverse to the line of sight and there is no enhancement from projection effects .",
    "this provides a natural explanation as to why an extension of the orphan stream is not visible all the way up to the position of uma  ii in sdss data .",
    "this phenomenon is also illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : densos ] which shows the peak density in the simulated orphan stream dropping , and the mean heliocentric distance increasing , as uma  ii is approached .",
    "[ fig : densum ] shows the distribution of heliocentric distances of stars in a @xmath2 field centred on uma  ii remnant , together with an inset that records the same information but now confined to the very innermost @xmath3 field .",
    "although the innermost parts are quite confined , the entire object has a significant depth along the line of sight of @xmath4 kpc , particularly in the one - component model .",
    "this is of the right order of magnitude to cause the broadening of features of the colour - magnitude diagram discerned by @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the initial mass ( stars and possible dark matter ) must exceed @xmath5  m@xmath6 to account for the length of the tidal tails and the known stellar mass in the orphan stream . but any object with a total mass @xmath7  m@xmath6 typically leads to a present - day uma  ii which is still strongly bound and has a luminous matter contribution at least an order of magnitude larger than the observed @xmath8  m@xmath6 .    one solution to this dilemma is to postulate that we are observing uma  ii at a time close to its disintegration .",
    "the last disc passage led to the almost complete disruption of the remnant object .",
    "the stars are now rapidly becoming unbound .",
    "they have not yet dispersed along the orbit into the tidal tails and we still see them in the innermost parts of uma  ii in a very confined area ( see the inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : densos ] ) .",
    "if so , then the interpretation of kinematic data may need special care .",
    "the first three rows of fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] all show one - component models .",
    "we used exactly the same set - up , but started the simulation at 9  gyr , 10  gyr or 11  gyr ago on the same orbit to make sure all models are now seen at the same position on the sky ( to exclude projection effects ) .",
    "the bound object in the first row has a small velocity dispersion , which is even lower than that in the surrounding tails .",
    "but the mean line of sight velocity is constant throughout the bound object and a gradient is only visible in the tails .",
    "this changes dramatically in the disrupting model shown in the middle panel .",
    "we still see an object with a similar total surface brightness , but it already shows sub - structure on small scales .",
    "the velocity dispersion is inflated by a factor of ten , but the dissolved nature of the remnant is already visible in the mean radial velocity . there is a strong gradient throughout the object , even though the mean velocity shows some flocculent structure .",
    "in the third row , in which the process of disruption is almost complete , the dissolved object has a low surface density , which will decrease further in the future until it matches that of the tails .",
    "the velocity dispersion is again low , at much the same value as that of the tails .",
    "looking at the mean radial velocity , it is hard to distinguish what remains of the object from the tails . for comparison , the final row of fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] shows the same quantities for the two - component model .",
    "the final bound object has smooth surface brightness contours , a high velocity dispersion because of the dark matter content and no gradient in the mean radial velocity .",
    "follow - up high precision kinematic observations of this new dwarf galaxy could reveal a high velocity dispersion , irrespective of the dark matter content .",
    "however , the existence of a gradient in the mean radial velocity provides a clear - cut distinction between a disrupting object and a bound , dark matter dominated object .",
    "hitherto , our galactic model is built from three fairly simple analytic components that could have some deficiencies .",
    "although we are using the same standard model as many previous investigators  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is prudent to examine the robustness of our results to changes in the underlying galactic potential . whilst re - running all the n - body simulations would be time - consuming , it is straightforward to carry out the initial test - particle calculations described in section 2 for different potentials .",
    "for example , we can vary the flattening of the halo .",
    "if we change the halo shape from spherical to moderately prolate or oblate , we still are able to fit all the data by slightly altering the starting velocities of uma  ii .",
    "this is illustrated in table  [ tab : extra ] , which gives the velocities , and the pericentric and apocentric distances for test particle calculations .",
    "note that @xmath9 in the logarithmic halo refers to the flattening of the equipotentials  the flattening in the density contours is typically two or three times greater  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for moderate changes",
    ", a suitable orbit can always be found that joins up uma  ii with the orphan stream , but uma  ii s predicted velocity and proper motions are then somewhat different . only if we use strongly prolate or oblate models does the orbit of uma  ii change so dramatically that we are not able to fit all the data on the orphan stream at once .",
    "however , the recent study of the multiple wraps of the sagittarius stream by @xcite provides strong evidence that only spherical or close to spherical halo shapes are possible for the milky way .    as a further check",
    ", we change the type of the galactic potential and use a dehnen & binney ( 1998 ) model .",
    "these potentials consist of three exponential discs ( thin , thick and gaseous ) .",
    "the halo and the bulge are represented by two spheroidal distributions @xmath10 here @xmath11 and @xmath9 is the axis ratio in the density , whilst the remaining parameters are chosen as in  @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab : extra ] shows how the intitial conditions or the test particle orbit change for the spherical case ( @xmath12 ) for comparison .",
    "again , an orbit matching uma  ii to the orphan stream can be found , and the changes in the initial conditions in table  [ tab : extra ] give an indication of the likely uncertainties in our predictions caused by changes in the galactic potential .",
    "we have carried out n - body simulations to model the evolution and disruption of the recently discovered dwarf galaxy uma  ii .",
    "the simulations reproduce the available observational data on the orphan stream within their error margins .",
    "we conclude that uma  ii is a likely progenitor of the orphan stream .",
    "we predict the radial velocity of uma  ii as @xmath13 .",
    "we also predict a strong velocity gradient along the orphan stream with the radial velocity varying from @xmath14 at the southern end to @xmath15 at the northern end .    from the length of the tails and the mass found in the orphan stream , we deduce that the initial mass of uma  ii is in excess of @xmath5  m@xmath6 .",
    "but , an object more massive than @xmath16  m@xmath6 can not be dissolved to produce the present day uma  ii , at least on the orbit derived from the observations .",
    "therefore , the initial mass of uma  ii has to be of the order a few @xmath5  m@xmath6 . to reduce uma  ii s mass through tidal effects to its present value",
    ", the distribution of stars and dark matter has to be extended .",
    "we carried out a suite of simulations of the disruption of uma  ii with one - component models , which have little dark matter beyond that associated with the stellar populations , and two - component models with a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath17 .",
    "there are strengths and weaknesses of both sets of simulations .",
    "both reproduce the positions and distances of the orphan stream , but the two - component models are in better agreement with the admittedly uncertain kinematic data derived by @xcite . however , the one - component models can provide a much better match to the disrupted nature of uma  ii today .",
    "the velocity dispersion is not a clean test between these two possibilities , as we have shown that objects undergoing disruption can have an anomalously high velocity dispersion .",
    "however , a clear - cut test is provided by the mean radial velocity , which should show no gradient for dark matter dominated models , but an obvious gradient for disrupting models .",
    "the orbit that we have derived supports the idea of @xcite that some of the anomalous , young halo globular clusters ( particularly pal  1 , arp  2 and possibly rup  105 ) may be associated with the orphan stream .",
    "intriguingly , the position and velocity of complex  a can also be matched , but only if it lies a revolution ahead in orbital phase .",
    "the association of these objects however makes most sense in the picture in which uma  ii , the young halo globular clusters and complex  a are all fragments of a much larger object like a tidal dwarf galaxy .",
