    "[ fig10 ] ( d ) ] .",
    "it should be noted that for the latter cases , we found @xmath141 and @xmath73 everywhere in the superfluid phase , which is quite different from the result for the @xmath7-type emitters in sec .",
    "[ fig3 ] . on the other hand , the first - order transition from sf(a ) to sf(b )",
    "is found for qd1 being similar to a model @xmath71 , the @xmath7-type emitters in sec .",
    "according to the result , we conclude that the first - order transition can be found when the different modes are coupling to the different transition processes .    here , let s see the origin of the different results between ( @xmath71 , qd1 ) and ( qd2 , @xmath72 , tls ) by applying semiclassical arguments to the @xmath72 model being similar to that was shown in the previous section . in the semiclassical limit @xmath202 , the energy of the system is given by @xmath203 and the saddle point equations in the semiclassical limit",
    "are @xmath204 where the relative phase between @xmath55 and @xmath56 is locked to zero for the energy minimization .",
    "therefore , in the semiclassical regime , only the sf(a+b ) phase with nonzero @xmath55 and nonzero @xmath56 is possible , in contrast to the case of ( @xmath71 , qd1 ) .",
    "the same conclusion is drawn also in the perturbative regime where @xmath205 . if the perturbation theory is applied to the three models ( qd2 , @xmath72 , tls ) , one obtains the second - order energy correction to the mi states in a general form @xmath206 with @xmath207 [ which vanishes for @xmath71 and qd1 as found in eq .",
    "( [ eq : emfsecond ] ) ] .",
    "this perturbative expression gives only the possibility that the second - order phase transition from mi to sf states occurs for two modes at the same transition point given by @xmath208 this indicates that all the mott phase is surrounded by a sf(a+b ) phase .",
    "therefore , reminding the semiclassical result again , the sf(a+b ) phase shows a smooth connection between the perturbative and semiclassical regime , being in contrast to the models ( @xmath71 , qd1 ) . according to the considerations , it is reasonable to conclude that there is no first - order phase transition in the three models ( qd2 , @xmath72 , tls ) .",
    "we investigated the possible quantum phase transition in coupled cavity qed arrays in presence of two cavity modes . within the gutzwiller approximation , which is equivalent to the mean field approximation",
    ", the ground state phase diagrams were obtained for types of emitter models with various light - matter interaction configurations , and we found the first - order phase transition between mott insulator ( mi ) phase and superfluid phase ( or between different superfluid phases ) for a certain range of the emitter models .",
    "the first - order phase transition can be detected by the output luminescence spectra and the photon statistics through @xmath209 measurements  @xcite .",
    "it seems to be necessary , in addition to the multiple components of photons , for the first - order phase transition to appear that the different photon modes should couple with different transitions between emitter states separately .",
    "( a finite difference of the transition energies @xmath210 seems to be important as well . ) in that case , the perturbative regime near the mott insulating phase and the semiclassical regime can have different types of the ground states , suggesting the first - order phase transition can occur in their intermediate regime .",
    "the origin of the first - order phase transition is analogous to that of spin-1 bh model , where the first - order transition occurs between the states with large difference in the internal spin degree of freedom ; mi states includes only the lowest spin state , meanwhile the sf states include the high spin states . therefore , the kinetic energy and spin - spin interaction energy gives the two competing minima of the total energy in spin-1 bh model . in case of the two - mode cavity qed arrays ,",
    "the competition between the dressed photon energy and emitter energy give rise to the first - order phase transition .",
    "the argument presented here on the origin of the first - order phase transition is useful for future application of these system to possible quantum optical switching devices .    as a future remark",
    ", the quantum phase transition of the first order , which is considered here in the thermal equilibrium condition , can occur also in the out - of - equilibrium condition .",
    "we know the thermodynamic phase transition between the different ground states occurs in order to minimize the total free energy of the system of interest .",
    "is there any quantity that can characterize the phase transition even in the out - of - equilibrium condition ? in the community of nonequilibrium statistical physics , it has been conjectured that the entropy generation rate of the system of interest should be minimized in the nonequilibrium stationary state , even though this claim has not been clarified yet  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the entropy generation rate might be such a quantity as to characterize the nonequilibrium phase transition also in the coupled cavity qed arrays .",
    "the problem is interesting also in case of the phase transition of the second order in single - mode cavity qed arrays , since the relation between thermodynamic and non - equilibrium phase transitions has been a recent hot topic .",
    "the related problem is also found in exciton - polariton systems in a semiconductor microcavity both in experiments  @xcite and theory  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the cavity qed arrays considered here are very useful to investigate this problem , since the density matrix of the system of interest can be fully solved within the mean field approximation irrespective of whether the systems are in the thermal - equilibrium or out - of - equilibrium conditions  @xcite .",
    "the application of the cavity qed arrays to that problem will be discussed elsewhere .",

    "phase boundaries of the second - order sf - mi transitions are obtained from the perturbation theory from the mi phases .",
    "considering small perturbation @xmath211 , the second - order energy correction for an initial state @xmath212 ( corresponding to one of the mi states ) is given by @xmath213 where @xmath214 is an excited state of the unperturbed hamiltonian ( dressed state ) . summing up all contributions , we obtained the anaytic expression in eq .",
