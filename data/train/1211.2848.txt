    "black holes are important objects in the theory of general relativity and in theories of modified gravity .",
    "recently , strong observational indications of black holes have been pointed out , for instance , in the centers of galaxies @xcite . among the black hole types ,",
    "those with axial symmetry are considered more realistic .",
    "the most important solution with this symmetry is the kerr metric , published in 1963 @xcite .",
    "the kerr geometry is asymptotically flat , and its anti - de sitter ( ads ) and de sitter ( ds ) generalizations were made in 1968 by carter @xcite .",
    "the latter case , the ds solution , is more appropriate , for instance , to model a black hole in an expanding universe .",

    "brane world models have been studied since the 1990s ( see the reviews @xcite , for instance ) . in the model presented by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos , and dvali ( add ) @xcite , and in several approaches proposed later , the brane  our universe  is embedded in a @xmath1-spacetime called bulk .",
    "the @xmath2 extra dimensions are compact , and all fields are confined on the brane . in preliminary calculations , the authors have stressed that for @xmath3 the extra dimensions have radii in the millimeter scale . one basic motivation for the add model was to solve the hierarchy problem , which is the difference between the electroweak scale ( @xmath4 tev ) and the 4-dimensional planck scale ( @xmath5 tev ) .",
    "according to this model , the electroweak scale is the fundamental scale , and the @xmath1-dimensional planck scale has the same order .",
    "another option to solve the hierarchy problem was the so - called randall - sundrum brane model .",
    "the add picture evolved to scenarios where the extra dimension can be unbounded .    in the first randall - sundrum model (",

    ", the bulk is described by a five - dimensional ads spacetime , which has two 3-branes as boundaries ( our universe and a hidden universe ) . the extra dimension is compact and it has finite radius .",
    "like the add model , in the rs - i the five - dimensional planck scale is the electroweak scale . on other hand ,",
    "the second randall - sundrum model ( rs - ii ) @xcite adopts only a single 3-brane ; in this case the extra dimension radius is infinity .    one way to construct compact solutions , black holes and wormholes for instance , in a randall - sundrum scenario ,",
    "is to consider the four - dimensional effective gravitational field equations deduced by shiromizu _",
    "these induced equations were obtained from gauss - codazzi equations in five dimensions . assuming a brane world type model ( the rs - ii , for instance ) , the authors enforce a @xmath6 symmetry in the bulk and obtain the 3-brane gravitational field equations , which involve brane quantities and bulk quantities . the complete solution ( bulk plus brane )",
