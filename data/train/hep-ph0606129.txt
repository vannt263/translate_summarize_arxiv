    "the higgs boson , which has not been observed yet , is the most mysterious particle in the standard model although it plays an important role : electroweak symmetry breaking and the origin of the fermion masses .",
    "successful electroweak symmetry breaking needs a negative mass squared for this particle and its size must be anomalously small compared to the cut - off scale of the theory .",
    "this situation motivated us to consider the supersymmetric standard model to protect the mass parameter from large quantum correction , but the higgs particle is still left mysterious .",
    "the higgs boson ( or higgsino ) mass parameter , the @xmath1-term , can not be protected by gauge symmetry or supersymmetry ( susy ) although quantum corrections are successfully removed .",
    "embedding the supersymmetric standard model into grand unified theories ( gut ) , motivated by gauge coupling unification  @xcite , makes the higgs particle more mysterious . even for the smallest group for grand unification , su(5 )",
    "@xcite , the higgs fields do not fit into a complete multiplet of the symmetry group , and therefore we need extra particles to appear at the gut scale @xmath2  gev .",
    "one mysterious feature is that , it is not easy to realize this situation with nearly massless higgs fields in models with the gut symmetry breaking by the higgs mechanism .",
    "the splitting of masses between the higgs fields and extra particles must be done by a coupling to the fields whose vacuum expectation values ( vev ) break the gut symmetry group , but in simple models it gives masses to the higgs fields of the order of @xmath3 .",
    "this is the famous doublet - triplet splitting problem .",
    "another mysterious feature of susy - gut models is the absence or suppression of dimension - five proton - decay operators .",
    "for example , in the simplest su(5 ) model , the higgs particles are embedded into the @xmath4 and @xmath5 representations which contain two colored partner of the higgs fields @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "if these colored higgs fields have masses by pairing to each other , i.e. , @xmath8 , dimension - five operators suppressed by the scale @xmath9 are generated by integrating out @xmath6 and @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "it has been studied that the colored higgs mass @xmath9 has to be quite large @xmath10  gev , which is disfavored by the unification of the gauge couplings  @xcite .",
    "the above two problems , the doublet - triplet splitting and the proton decay , are actually related and there is a simple solution to these problems .",
    "if we are to avoid dimension - five proton - decay operators such as @xmath11 in the superpotential , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 being the quark and lepton doublets , an easy way is to impose a symmetry under which matter fields are charged , e.g. , both @xmath12 and @xmath13 have charge unity . in su(5 ) susy guts , this means that both of the higgs fields in @xmath14 and @xmath5 representations have charge @xmath15 in order to have yukawa interactions , and thus the mass term is forbidden .",
    "now , to give mass terms to the colored higgs fields while keeping the symmetry unbroken we need to introduce another pair of @xmath4 and @xmath5 field which have charge @xmath16 , but in this case , we have either zero or four higgs - doublet fields at low energy which is unacceptable .",
    "of course , adding another pair of @xmath4 and @xmath17 field with charge @xmath15 results in extra massless colored higgs fields .",
    "therefore , in order to have only two higgs doublets while forbidding the proton decay by continuous symmetry , we need to repeat the procedure of adding @xmath4 and @xmath5 forever and end up with an infinite number of higgs fields in @xmath4 and @xmath5 representations  @xcite .",
    "while an infinite number of particles sounds unreasonable in field theory , it is quite possible to realize this situation in models with extra - dimensions .",
    "the infinite number of particles is identified with the kaluza - klein tower of the fields which are propagating into the bulk of the extra - dimension .",
    "indeed , simple gut models have been constructed in higher dimensional space - time , where the boundary condition breaks the gut symmetry and there is no doublet - triplet splitting  @xcite or the proton decay problem  @xcite . in this picture , the higgs particles become less mysterious .",
    "they are just bulk fields .    on the other hand",
    ", there is another familiar mechanism of having an infinite tower of particles in field theory , that is actually happening in qcd .",
    "when an asymptotically free gauge theory becomes strong at low energy , the effective theory below that scale is described by gauge - singlet particles such as mesons and baryons .",
    "these particles have also an infinite tower of excitation states .",
    "this fact naturally leads us to think of the possibility of realizing higgs particles as composite fields in some strongly coupled gauge theory which breaks the gut symmetry dynamically .",
    "this question is also interesting from the viewpoint of the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite .",
    "the extra - dimensional gut models above may be interpreted as a dual picture of the strongly coupled theory .",
    "the explicit gauge symmetry breaking in the extra - dimensional picture may be justified by the presence of viable dynamical gut breaking models .",
    "constructing gut models associated with a strongly coupled gauge theory have been attempted by the group of hotta , izawa and yanagida  @xcite .",
    "( see also  @xcite for subsequent works . )",
    "various gauge groups for the strong interaction , su(3 ) ( @xmath18 u(1 ) )  @xcite , su(5 )  @xcite and so(6 )  @xcite , were considered .",
    "it was found that the doublet - triplet splitting can be easily realized via the missing partner mechanism while preserving an ( anomalous ) u(1 ) symmetry which forbids dimension - five proton decays . along a similar line , a model with sp(2 ) gauge group",
    "has also been constructed recently in ref .",
    "@xcite where the model is quite simplified .",
    "( our convention is such that sp(1 ) @xmath19 su(2 ) . )",
    "the model consists of six flavors of quarks of sp(2 ) and the five of flavors are identified with the @xmath4 and @xmath5 representation fields of the su(5 ) gut .",
    "the other flavor turns out to be a ( constituent of ) the higgs doublets in low energy . in this model ,",
    "the conformal field theory ( cft ) nature of the sp(2 ) interaction above the gut scale plays a crucial role .",
    "a similar approach in warped extra - dimension can also be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a generalization of the sp(2 ) model .",
    "we find that models with sp(@xmath0 ) with @xmath20 , and so(@xmath0 ) with @xmath21 work for dynamical gut breaking while having massless doublet higgs fields , and no viable su(@xmath0 ) group is found under the assumption on the particle content and superpotential . of particular interest is the case with so(@xmath0 ) gauge group .",
    "there is no exotic particle left massless without adding superpotential terms to remove those particles .    with the success of the doublet - triplet splitting while forbidding the proton decay , the final missing piece for the higgs mystery is the finite @xmath1-term . in the gravity",
    "mediated supersymmetry breaking scenario  @xcite , it is possible to obtain a correct size of the @xmath1-term in a simple way  @xcite .",
    "however , we find an alternative interesting possibility in the so(9 ) model .",
    "instead of solving the @xmath1-problem , if we add a small @xmath1-term in the superpotential , supersymmetry breaks down at the intermediate scale @xmath22 .",
    "although this is not the true vacuum , it is shown to be meta - stable  @xcite .",
    "it is amusing that the @xmath1-term can drive supersymmetry breaking , which is the opposite direction to the usual thought .",
    "the smallness of the @xmath1-term is `` explained '' by demanding a low supersymmetry breaking scale .",
    "the higgs fields can be responsible not only for electroweak symmetry breaking but also for gut and supersymmetry breaking .",
    "there is an interesting possibility for the nature of the small @xmath1-term .",
    "the small @xmath1-term added by hand can come from a negative cosmological constant term in the supergravity action . by the giudice - masiero mechanism  @xcite , the ( supersymmetric ) cosmological constant term",
    "induces a @xmath1-term in the presence of a particular k \" ahler potential term .",
    "this @xmath1-term , in turn , drives supersymmetry breaking which gives positive contribution to the vacuum energy and cancels the net cosmological constant .",
    "we start the discussion of dynamical gut breaking in section 2 , there the general set - up is defined .",
    "we analyze a successful model , the so(9 ) model , in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "the mechanism of @xmath1-term driven supersymmetry breaking is presented and we discuss the mediation of the supersymmetry breaking to our sector .",
    "the generation of the @xmath1-term through the cosmological constant is discussed in section 5 .",
    "@xcite , a simple model for the dynamical gut breaking was constructed based on an sp(2 ) gauge theory .",
    "we study a generalization of the model with various gauge groups : su(@xmath0 ) , sp(@xmath0 ) and so(@xmath0 ) .",
    "models with sp(@xmath0 ) and so(@xmath0 ) with a certain range of @xmath0 is found to be viable but no viable su(@xmath0 ) group is found .",
    "although they are not successful models , we start with the discussion of the su(@xmath0 ) models in which we can see the essential features of this class of models .      .",
    "the particle content of the su(@xmath0 ) model . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the so(@xmath0 ) model can also be constructed , and turns out to be the most interesting case .",
    "a detailed analysis will be presented in the next section .",
    "the particle content is given in table  [ tab : content - so ] where we have to introduce only one @xmath23 field in contrast to the case of su(@xmath0 ) or sp(@xmath0 ) .",
    "again , the form of the superpotential is the same as that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : superpotential ] ) . with the same analysis",
    ", we find that there are stable vacua for @xmath24 with massless higgs doublet fields and there are no unwanted massless fields at low energy .",
    "the theory is asymptotically free for @xmath25 .",
    "additional singlet fields under the standard model gauge group appear for @xmath26 .",
    "we discuss in more detail the most interesting model among those in the previous section : the so(9 ) @xmath18 su(5)@xmath27 model .",
    "the phenomenological aspects of the model such as gauge coupling unification , proton decay and yukawa interactions for matter fields will be addressed .",
    "many of these features are shared with the model of ref .",
    "@xcite .    the particle content and the tree - level superpotential",
    "are defined in the previous section in table  [ tab : content - so ] and in eq .",
    "( [ eq : superpotential ] ) .",
    "the model is an so(9 ) gauge theory with 11 flavors which is in the conformal window  @xcite .",
    "this fact becomes important for the discussion of the phenomenological issues .",
    "we take a picture in which @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the scale where the so(9 ) gauge theory flows into the fixed point . since confinement does not happen until the fields decouple , the actual confinement scale coincides with the gut scale @xmath30 which is set by the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "therefore we have an energy region with a cft between @xmath33 and @xmath29 .",
    "the analysis of the vacuum can be done along the same line in the su(@xmath0 ) case .",
    "we first take dual picture of the theory which is an so(6 ) gauge theory with 11 flavors with a superpotential  @xcite : @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are mesons made of @xmath12 and @xmath38 which are singlet under so(6 ) and @xmath39 , * 15 * and @xmath40 under su(5)@xmath41 .",
    "the mesons involving @xmath23 are @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and these are @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath45 under su(5)@xmath27 .",
    "the dual quarks @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 transform as @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 under so(6 ) @xmath18 su(5)@xmath27 .",
    "again @xmath52 is introduced such that dimensionality of the superpotential is correct .",
    "it is interesting that this dual picture is similar to the so(6 ) @xmath18 so(10)@xmath27 model proposed in ref .  @xcite . by the vev of @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vacuum-2 ] ) , four flavors ( doublet part of @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) obtain masses and the low energy theory becomes an so(6 ) theory with seven flavors ( colored part of @xmath46 and @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) .",
    "this is still an interacting theory .",
    "when we take the dual again , the theory now comes back to the original electric theory but the gauge group is reduced to so(5 ) .",
    "the superpotential is @xmath53 where we wrote down only terms relevant for the discussion .",
    "the quarks @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 will be identified with original quarks upon integrating out the massive fields .",
    "the doublet - triplet splitting happens in the same way as the su(@xmath0 ) examples .",
    "the massless doublet is obtained with @xmath57 which is ensured by the @xmath58 condition , and the triplets get masses by pairing with dual mesons .",
    "in contrast to the case of the su(3 ) model in the previous section , there is no non - perturbatively generated superpotential .",
    "therefore , the symmetry of the superpotential at the classical level , @xmath23-number ( @xmath59 ) , is respected .",
    "this is exactly the situation discussed in the introduction .",
    "this fact becomes important in the discussion of the proton decay .    by solving the @xmath60 conditions",
    ", we can find a solution in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vacuum-2 ] ) and ( [ eq : mqq - dual ] ) that gives a mass term to @xmath61 and @xmath62 . after integrating out the heavy fields , the theory ends up with an so(5 ) theory with one flavor @xmath56 without a superpotential , and we have massless higgs doublet fields .",
    "this result is the same as the classical analysis in the higgs phase .",
    "the decoupling of the fields immediately make the so(5 ) interaction strong and the quark @xmath56 confines .",
    "this so(5 ) one flavor theory has known to have two branches  @xcite . in one branch ,",
    "a superpotential @xmath63 is generated with @xmath64 being the dynamical scale of one flavor so(5 ) theory and @xmath65 .",
    "this branch is unacceptable because there is no ground state . in the other branch ,",
    "no superpotential is generated and there is no singularity at the origin of the meson @xmath66 even though the gauge symmetry is enhanced there at the classical level .",
    "therefore there is a stable vacuum in this branch .",
    "the low energy spectrum is just a pair of doublet higgs fields with a massless meson @xmath66 and the superpotential is @xmath67 .",
    "now we start to discuss the phenomenological issues .",
    "first , we need to check whether gauge coupling unification is maintained in this model .",
    "the first order answer to this question is yes .",
    "there is no exotic massless fields in the spectrum , and the running of the gauge coupling constants are the same as that of the minimal supersymmetric standard model .",
    "however , the threshold correction is also important for precise unification , which is not obvious .",
    "the question depends on the spectrum of the heavy fields and that can not be estimated without the knowledge of the k \" ahler potential .",
    "however , the qualitative discussion is still possible by assuming that the k \" ahler potential is not very different from the classical one . in this case",
    ", the mass spectrum can be estimated by explicitly calculating the mass of the components in @xmath12 and @xmath38 at the classical level .",
    "there are three classes of fields : fields eaten by the so(9)/so(5 ) gauge fields , ones eaten by the su(5)@xmath27/(su(3)@xmath68 @xmath18 su(2)@xmath69 @xmath18 u(1)@xmath70 ) gauge fields , and others that obtain masses by the superpotential .",
    "the first two classes of fields have masses of order @xmath71 and the last ones have @xmath72 . therefore , in order not to destroy gauge coupling unification due to the mass splitting between those two , the mass parameter @xmath31 is required to be around the gut scale @xmath33 which means the scale @xmath32 should also be of the order of the gut scale .",
    "this sounds unreasonable since we expect that the higher dimensional operators are suppressed by the plank scale @xmath73 that is two order of magnitude larger than the gut scale .",
    "also , with gut scale suppressed operators , we are not allowed to discuss the high energy theory above the gut scale , which we are doing . however , in this model , the mechanism of suppressing @xmath32 is already built in . as we discussed before , this so(9 ) theory is in the conformal window , and we expect an energy range of cft above the gut scale . in this case , the meson fields have large negative anomalous dimension which enhances the couplings in low energy . in other words ,",
    "the interaction never gets strong at high energy .",
    "the anomalous dimension of the meson fields are calculated by using the relation between the non - anomalous @xmath74-charge and the dimension of the operator as follows  @xcite : @xmath75 with this anomalous dimension , the coefficient @xmath76 enhances almost quadratically with scale towards low energy .",
    "therefore it is natural to have a large enhancement . if we assume that the original operator is suppressed by the plank scale @xmath73 , the factor of 100 enhancement is easily realized by a small cft range such as from @xmath77  gev to @xmath78  gev . in the same way",
    ", the coefficient @xmath31 enhances almost linearly with energy scale towards low energy .",
    "therefore , the original scale of the model @xmath31 evaluated at the planck scale was smaller than the gut scale by a factor of 10 or so .",
    "this is an interesting scale for the right - handed neutrino masses in the see - saw model  @xcite .",
    "the gauge coupling of su(5)@xmath27 above the gut scale can be in the perturbative region all the way up to the planck scale even accounting for the large anomalous dimension of @xmath12 and @xmath38  @xcite .",
    "the yukawa coupling constants between matter and the higgs fields originate from higher dimensional operators since the higgs fields are identified with the meson fields .",
    "the gauge invariant terms : @xmath79 become the yukawa interactions at low energy .",
    "the matter fields are represented by ( @xmath80 ) and ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the low energy yukawa coupling is roughly @xmath81 and @xmath82 , where @xmath3 is the gut scale .",
    "the yukawa coupling constant for the top quark is necessary to be @xmath83 , which again requires that the scale @xmath84 to be the gut scale .",
    "this is not a problem for the same reason as before .",
    "these operators are almost marginal operators and thus the coefficient is enhanced linearly in low energy by the large anomalous dimensions .    after integrating out the massive fields with the yukawa interactions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : yukawa ] ) , the final low energy effective superpotential is : @xmath85 with @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 being the quark superfields and @xmath89 , @xmath90 are the lepton superfields .",
    "in addition to the usual yukawa interactions @xmath91 , the baryon - number - violating terms ( the first two terms in the parenthesis ) appeared . however , as long as @xmath66 is stabilized near the origin , these terms do not cause rapid proton decay .",
    "the particle content of the low energy effective theory is just that of the minimal supersymmetric standard model and a singlet field @xmath66 which only couples to the higher dimensional operators .",
    "the value of @xmath66 depends on the shape of the k \" ahler potential and how supersymmetry is broken .",
    "we will discuss these in the next section .",
    "we briefly mention the case with @xmath92 and 8 , where the vacuum with eq .",
    "( [ eq : vacuum-2 ] ) exists and the doublet - triplet splitting happens for these cases .",
    "all of the models are in the conformal window . for @xmath93 ,",
    "the low energy effective theory has an extra u(1 ) gauge symmetry with two charged ( but the standard model singlet ) fields @xmath94 and @xmath95 . since this theory is at the edge of the conformal window ( barely asymptotically free ) , we do not expect the large enhancement of the yukawa coupling constants . for @xmath96",
    ", the low energy theory again has an extra u(1 ) factor .",
    "there are three standard model singlet fields @xmath97 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are monopoles , with superpotential @xmath98 .",
    "the unknown function @xmath99 is non - vanishing at the origin . for @xmath100",
    ", there is no extra gauge symmetry and there are two branches as in the @xmath101 case . in one branch ,",
    "stable vacuum exists with a superpotential term @xmath102 where @xmath97 and @xmath48 are the standard model singlet fields .",
    "again , @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) is an unknown function but non - zero at the origin .",
    "in the previous section , we have seen that the so(9 ) model is quite successful in obtaining massless higgs fields in the low energy spectrum",
    ". however , to be phenomenologically completely viable , the higgs fields have to have a mass term of @xmath105 , the @xmath1-term , otherwise higgsinos become massless which is excluded by experiment . as we see below , it is possible to obtain a @xmath1-term by giving a small mass term for @xmath23 , but it causes a dramatic effect in the dynamical system : dynamical supersymmetry breaking  @xcite .    the @xmath1-term can be obtained by adding a superpotential term : @xmath106 which becomes @xmath107 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dual - dual ] ) . with this term",

    "@xmath111 , this is nothing but the @xmath1-term , @xmath112 with @xmath113 .",
    "it is obvious that the mesons made of @xmath23 become massive once we introduce the mass term for the quark @xmath23 .",
    "this is also easy to understand in the classical level analysis . since the higgs fields are simply the components in @xmath23 , the term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mu - hat ] ) is the @xmath1-term .    the term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mu - hat ] ) also gives a potential term for @xmath66 . with eq .",
    "( [ eq : s - prime ] ) and the superpotential in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dual - dual ] ) , @xmath56 obtains a term in low energy : @xmath114 and after confinement of the so(5 ) gauge theory , it becomes a linear superpotential for the meson @xmath115 : @xmath116 if we ignore the higher dimensional operators in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eff - sup ] ) , there is no solution for @xmath117 .",
    "interestingly , this does not mean that the vacuum is destabilized or quarks and leptons must condense by the presence of the small @xmath1-term .",
    "first , we start the discussion by ignoring the higher dimensional operators . in this case , it was shown by intriligator , seiberg and shih  @xcite that the vacuum is meta - stable and supersymmetry is broken there .",
    "the argument is pretty easy . whether the vacuum is stable or not depends on the shape of the k \" ahler potential for @xmath66 , but since we know that for large @xmath66 , where the classical analysis is valid , the potential grows by the mass term",
    "therefore , there must be a local minimum somewhere .",
    "the true supersymmetric vacua exists in the other branch where @xmath118 is stabilized far away from the origin @xmath119 ( this is meaningless because it is much larger than the planck scale ) and also at different vacua from that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vacuum-2 ] ) .",
    "since the true vacua exist far away or energy difference between the true vacuum and the meta - stable one is much smaller than the height of the potential barrier of @xmath120 , we expect that the life - time of this meta - stable vacuum is long enough for us  @xcite .    once we include the higher dimensional operators , another supersymmetric vacuum appears where quarks and leptons acquire vevs .",
    "however , if we assume that the scalar components of quarks and leptons obtain positive supersymmetry breaking mass - squared terms , the vacuum is again meta - stable and its life - time is very long since the peak of the potential barrier is located far from the origin @xmath121 compared to the height of the potential @xmath122  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we conclude that there is a supersymmetry breaking meta - stable vacuum .",
    "the size of supersymmetry breaking is @xmath123 with a canonically normalized field @xmath124 . for the higgs fields , terms in the k \" ahler potential such as @xmath125",
    "are expected to be generated by the non - perturbative effect and supersymmetry breaking can be mediated directly ( in the sense of gravity mediation ) . in this case , the soft scalar masses for the higgs fields are obtained with a similar size to the @xmath1-term . if the term @xmath126 is generated , which should be possible since there is no unbroken symmetry to protect the term , the trilinear @xmath127 and the bilinear @xmath128-term is also non - vanishing and of the same order with the @xmath1-term .",
    "if the matter fields in the third generation couple to the higgs fields strongly , the soft scalar masses for those fields can also be obtained directly .",
    "gauge mediation  @xcite also happens if @xmath129 is stabilized away from the origin , where the colored - higgs fields play a role of the messenger field . by integrating out @xmath130 @xmath62 in eq .",

    ", there must be a gauge - mediation effect since the supersymmetry breaking scale is too low ( @xmath134 ) for gravity mediation .",

    "the gravitino mass is estimated to be @xmath156 this mass range is interesting for cosmology  @xcite and also for collider experiments  @xcite .    for other choices of @xmath0",
    ", the situation is different . for @xmath93 , the addition of the @xmath1-term",
    "just gives a mass term for @xmath94 and @xmath95 which does not cause supersymmetry breaking . for @xmath96 and 8",
    ", the term @xmath157 appears but the supersymmetry unbroken vacuum exists where @xmath158 ( or @xmath48 for @xmath100 ) fields acquire non - vanishing vev .",
    "however , it is possible that the @xmath97 is stabilized far from the origin where @xmath158 or @xmath48 is heavy , and supersymmetry is broken there .",
    "because of the large anomalous dimension , the size of @xmath1-parameter is originally smaller than @xmath105 by a factor of 10 or so .",
    "this is about the size of the gravitino mass .",
    "therefore it is possible that the origin of the @xmath1-term can actually be the cosmological constant by the giudice - masiero mechanism  @xcite . assuming a presence of a @xmath139 ( @xmath159 ) term in the k \" ahler potential , this effectively becomes the @xmath160-term in the superpotential .",
    "it is equivalent to study a model with @xmath161 where @xmath162 is a constant term which represents the negative cosmological constant term , @xmath163 , of order @xmath164 in the unit of @xmath165 .",
    "this term is always necessary to cancel the positive vacuum energy from the supersymmetry breaking , @xmath166 .",
    "the parameters have a hierarchical structure : @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 , where @xmath170 represents the enhancement of the coupling through the large anomalous dimension .    by the k \" ahler transformation , @xmath171 and @xmath172 with @xmath173 being a chiral superfield ,",
    "this is identical to the system : @xmath174 by expanding the superpotential , we obtain a @xmath160-term of order @xmath175 . within the range @xmath176 , where the effective theory makes sense ,",
    "the minimum of the potential exists near the origin @xmath177 , and the cosmological constant can be cancelled when @xmath178 .",
    "supersymmetry is broken at the minimum with @xmath179 .",
    "the value of @xmath145 at the minimum is @xmath180 which is consistent with the required value for gauge mediation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gauge - med ] ) and also the suppression of the coefficient of the dimension - five proton - decay operators in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eff - sup ] ) .    in the conventional scenario of supersymmetry breaking , some mass scales , such as a dynamical scale ,",
    "determine the size of @xmath181 and the net cosmological constant is cancelled by an independent negative contribution from the @xmath162-term .",
    "however , in this scenario , the @xmath162-term drives supersymmetry breaking , and therefore these are related .",
    "in particular , it is interesting that supersymmetry is recovered in the flat limit ( @xmath182 ) , resulting in the supersymmetric flat space rather than the supersymmetry broken de sitter space .",
    "from the consideration of the mystery of the higgs particle , we arrived at a rather unified picture . at every stage of the phase transitions , gut breaking , supersymmetry breaking and electroweak symmetry breaking , the higgs field may be playing a crucial role .",
    "we have succeeded to construct a realistic gut model with dynamical symmetry breaking , and found that , in the so(9 ) model , the inclusion of the @xmath1-term for the higgs fields triggers supersymmetry breaking in a meta - stable vacua by the same dynamics .",
    "we discuss possible generalizations of the model here .",
    "although we discussed the gut breaking and supersymmetry breaking in a unified picture , we can separately discuss the following mechanisms :    * doublet - triplet splitting through dynamical gut breaking , * @xmath1-term driven supersymmetry breaking .",
    "dynamical gut breaking without supersymmetry breaking is possible .",
    "the @xmath1-term can be obtained from separate susy breaking sector by , e.g. , the giudice - masiero mechanism .",
    "the so(10)@xmath27 extension of the model should be straightforward and is interesting for the discussion of the neutrino masses .",
    "considering different types of particle content and assumption on the superpotential is also worth investigating .",
    "it is possible to obtain massless colored higgs fields instead of the doublet fields . in this case",
    ", the doublet - triplet splitting can be done by introducing a pair of elementary higgs fields with the coupling to the meson operators  @xcite .",
    "this is possible in the rank(@xmath35)=3 vacuum with so(@xmath0 ) with @xmath183 .",
    "@xmath1-term driven supersymmetry breaking can be discussed without gut .",
    "for example , in the so(9 ) model we can gauge only su(2)@xmath69 @xmath18 u(1)@xmath70 subgroup of su(5)@xmath27 . then the dynamical scale can be lowered ( or even raised ) as long as the gauge couplings of the standard model gauge group maintains the perturbativity . adding a @xmath1-term breaks supersymmetry in the same way but",
    "the scale can be much lower ( or higher ) .",
    "gauge mediation through the colored - higgs fields might be able to be generalized as a realistic direct gauge - mediation model .",
    "we leave those questions for future studies . in any case , the prediction to the low energy spectrum is a modification of the gauge - mediation type in the higgs sector . in the so(9 )",
    "model we presented , there is a cosmological problem associated with the modulus @xmath145  @xcite .",
    "the mass of @xmath145 is of the same order of @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath105 independent of the dynamical scale .",
    "a realistic cosmological scenario needs to be considered .",
    "we see that two mechanisms non - trivially fit into a picture : dynamical gut and supersymmetry breaking .",
    "although it is not likely that we can directly probe the gut theory by experiments , the spectrum of the supersymmetric particles in low energy gives us a hint for high energy theories . in this model , the direct connection between the higgs fields and the supersymmetry breaking sector provides a characteristic feature in the low energy spectrum .",
