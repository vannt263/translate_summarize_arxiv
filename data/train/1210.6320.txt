    "over past several years there has been sustained experimental and theoretical interest in paired fermion ground states with unconventional pairing symmetry . among these are various types of p - wave spin triplet condensates . correlated electron systems , such as ,",
    "srru@xmath5o@xmath6  @xcite and ferromagnetic superconductors  @xcite are believed to possess p - wave triplet symmetry .",
    "fermi systems with unequal species population , as in quark matter  @xcite , magnetic field induced organic superconductors  @xcite and in cold fermion systems with unequally populated hyperfine states  @xcite , add a fascinating dimension .",
    "discovery of s - wave superfluidity in cold atoms  @xcite subjected to s - wave feshbach resonance ( fr ) , and observations of p - wave fr  @xcite in @xmath7 and @xmath8 had raised the prospect for observing p - wave superfluidity in cold fermi gases . while this may not be as easy , alternate methods  @xcite and optical lattices  @xcite offer encouraging prospects .",
    "past theory work on p - wave superfluidity in the bec - bcs crossover region include those for a single - component fermi gas  @xcite , as well as for the two - component case  @xcite with equal - species population .",
    "however , theory work on p - wave pairing for unequal species population has been limited  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study p - wave superfluidity in a two - component fermi system with _ unequal _",
    "population , across weak - coupling bcs to strong coupling bec regimes .",
    "we focus on the case where inter - species pairing interaction is dominant .",
    "while this is interesting to study on general grounds , we are also motivated by work  @xcite on population imbalanced fermi mixtures in optical lattices , and by the observation  @xcite that unlike liquid @xmath9 , pairing interaction in cold atoms may be highly anisotropic in `` spin''-space .",
    "( `` spin '' referring to hyperfine states ) .",
    "for example , in @xmath7 , when the hyperfine pair @xmath10 is at resonance , the pairs @xmath11 and @xmath12 would not be .",
    "so , intra - spin interactions can be neglected .",
    "pairs in p - wave superfluids with unlike `` spin '' components can , however , have different @xmath13 components , namely , @xmath14 ; the gap parameters @xmath15 are related to the spherical harmonics , @xmath16 .",
    "our study of the population imbalanced fermi system lead to several new results and predictions .",
    "these should appeal broadly to systems exhibiting p - wave pairing , especially those with population imbalance between species .",
    "we find a rich superfluid ( sf ) ground state ( gs ) structure . under a condition on relative phase between three pairing amplitudes @xmath17 s ( @xmath18 hereforth ) ,",
    "a multitude of `` mixed '' superfluid states of the form @xmath19 are found to be degenerate with @xmath20 ; these give the _ global _ minimum gs energy .",
    "in addition , we find states with _ local _ minimum energy .",
    "we provide a geometric representation of the p - wave sf states ( fig .",
    "our zero temperature polarization ( @xmath21 ) vs p - wave coupling phase diagram ( fig .",
    "2 ) shows two superfluid phases , comprising of states with global and local minimum energy respectively , and a region of phase separation .",
    "our results suggest the possibility of a quantum phase transition between the two superfluid phases , driven by polarization .",
    "we find the @xmath22 0 ground state structure to be preserved in the @xmath23 0 limit ; hence richer than that obtained earlier @xcite for @xmath21 = 0 .",
    "the energies of the `` mixed '' states show oscillations with the relative phase angle ( fig.3 ) , that may be interesting to explore experimentally .",
    "we also study the behavior of superfluid ground state energy with coupling and polarization .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the model used for describing the two - component fermi system with unequal spin population across the bcs to bec regimes .",
    "we provide details of the finite - temperature imaginary - time green s function method used for obtaining the coupled p - wave gap and number equations , and the grand canonical potential . in sec .",
    "iii , we carry out a free energy analysis of the p - wave ground states in a population imbalanced system .",
    "we provide details of the derivation of the free energy to quartic order in pairing gap amplitudes , and the expansion coefficients in terms of the underlying coupling and polarization .",
    "this section also shows how minimization of the free energy leads to conditions of stability of p - wave superfluid phases and the nature of the states that may give rise to global and local minima of the free energy .",
    "a geometric depiction is provided for a clearer understanding of the possible p - wave states , and the dependence of some of the states on a phase angle . to provide a perspective on the stability of the states , we also present here a brief discussion of connection of the stable states to `` critical points '' in catastrophe theory . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss our self - consistent solutions of coupled gap and number equations for fixed polarization and coupling parameter .",
    "we outline how the free energy expansion coefficients and the free energy are obtained , and the scheme by which the p - wave coupling vs polarization phase diagram across bec - bcs regimes is constructed ( sec iva ) .",
    "our study of the variation of the free - energy with phase angle , coupling and polarization is discussed in sec ivb .",
    "we conclude with a summary of the work and discussions in sec . v.",
    "we consider a fermi system with unequal `` spin''(@xmath24 ) population , and with all fermions having the same mass .",
    "pairing interactions in all three @xmath3 channels ( @xmath25 ) are taken to be equal , and intra - species interactions ( @xmath26 or @xmath27 ) are set to zero . since we adjust self - consistently the chemical potential with the strength and sign of the coupling , in our fermion - only model , molecules would appear naturally as 2-fermion bound states .",
    "the @xmath28 triplet pairing hamiltonian is then given by : @xmath29 where @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator for a fermion with momentum @xmath32 , kinetic energy @xmath33 , and spin @xmath34 ; @xmath35 is the chemical potential of each component , and @xmath36 .",

    "instability in the stability matrix can just indicate instability to another phase , but not the nature of the phase . however , this is sufficient to map out the phase boundary , e.g. the critical polarization line @xmath168 , where superfluid gap vanishes .",

    "this suggests the interesting possibility that at t=0 , polarization may drive a quantum phase transition from sf1 to sf2 .",
    "it may also be possible to access sf2 at t@xmath1710 . at even larger polarizations , for the same reason",

    "sf1 , sf2 , and ps occupy a relatively much narrower part of the phase diagram on the bcs side compared to the bec side . in our two - component system with inter - species interaction ,",
    "ps persists into full polarization , p=1 .",
    "this is reasonable because at p=1 , the system is essentially a one - component system in which the absence of minority species atoms makes inter - species interaction inoperative .",
    "such a system can exhibit superfluidity only under the effect of intra - species interactions .",
    "we note that since we have considered p - wave ( @xmath172 = 1 ) pairing with unlike spin components ( @xmath173 , @xmath174 ) , the gap functions can be classified as @xmath172 = 1 representations of the o(3 ) group embedded in o(6 ) .",
    "( 13 ) above reflects this o(3 ) symmetry .",
    "accordingly , the states in sf1 , in particular the @xmath175 states a and b , can be identified with the known `` axial '' or `` ferromagnetic '' phase , while the states in sf2 , such o and m , with the known `` polar '' phase .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "2 shows the calculated behavior of chemical potential @xmath73 across the bec - bcs regime .",
    "it deviates significantly from the fermi energy ( given by @xmath176 = 1 line ) in a wider region around the bec - bcs crossover , even on the bcs side , and drops much more rapidly to negative values on the bec side compared to the s - wave case . for sufficiently weak coupling in the bcs regime , @xmath73 approaches fermi energy @xmath177 .      except for a , b ,",
    "the continuum of `` mixed '' sf states on the semicircle ( fig.1 ) are characterized by a relative phase @xmath178 , so that the energies of these states are expected to oscillate with @xmath132 .",
    "results for three representative cases , obtained from our numerical calculations , are shown in fig 3(a ) . for @xmath179 ,",
    "the energies lie higher than the gs global minimum ; the maximum amplitude occurring for the state c in fig.1 .",
    "this raises the possibility of observing @xmath132-oscillation in each of the states on the semicircle using phase sensitive experimental technique(s ) .",

    "extrapolated to normal regime , energies corresponding to different polarizations would be different , and also not cross .",
    "for a given @xmath84 , @xmath163 lies higher for smaller @xmath21 , presumably due to the lower majority - species band becoming progressively more occupied with increasing @xmath21 , thereby lowering @xmath103 with increasing polarization . for small @xmath21",

    "the energies of a multitude of `` mixed '' sf states show oscillations with a relative phase angle , that may be observed in phase sensitive experiments .",
