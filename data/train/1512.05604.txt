    "the measurements of type ia supernovae luminosity distances indicate that the universe is currently undergoing an accelerated expansion  @xcite@xcite .",
    "the cause of this late time acceleration has been one of the most challenging problems of modern cosmology .",
    "such an acceleration requires , in general , some components of negative pressure , with the equation of state parameter , @xmath2 , less than @xmath3 , to make an acceleration for the universe .",
    "several mechanisms , that are considered to be responsible for this expansion , have been proposed , namely in particular : the @xmath4cdm model , dark energy models and modified gravities . in the @xmath4cdm model ( e.g. ,",
    "@xcite ) , around @xmath5 of the mass  energy density of the universe is made of the barionic and dark matter , and the rest is constituted by the cosmological constant  @xcite .",
    "actually , the cosmological constant is the simplest candidate which corresponds to the value of @xmath6 , however , the value of the observed cosmological constant is less than the planck scale by a factor of @xmath7 orders of magnitude .",
    "this problem , that is related to the non  comparability of the value of dark energy density with the field theoretical vacuum energy , is called the cosmological constant problem , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite .",
    "another approach has been generalized by considering a source term , with an equation of state parameter less than @xmath8 , that is known as dark energy , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite . however , the nature of dark energy is still unknown and actually , the nature of both the dark matter and dark energy are one of the most important issues in physics . in this approach ,",
    "the observed cosmological evidences imply on the existence of these components of the cosmic energy budget , and even indicate that around @xmath9 of the universe is composed by the dark matter and dark energy .",
    "some candidates for the dark matter ( e.g. , neutralinos and axions ) and dark energy ( e.g. , quintessence ) have been considered , although no direct detection has been reported until now .",
    "also , various scalar field models of dark energy have been studied in the literature , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the late time acceleration can be caused by purely gravitational effects , i.e. one may consider modifying the gravitational theory , see , e.g. , refs .  @xcite@xcite .",
    "for instance , @xmath10 gravities ( as the simplest family of the higher  order gravities ) have been based on replacing the scalar curvature @xmath11 in the einstein ",

    "@xcite that by adding a term of @xmath12 to @xmath11 , when the inverse curvature term dominates , one typically expects that the universe expands with the desired late time acceleration , however , this model suffers from a number of problems such as matter instability , see , e.g. , ref .",

    "@xcite@xcite .    in this work",
    ", we propose to probe the cosmological considerations of another type of modified gravity theories , namely @xmath16 gravity , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "theory of @xmath16 gravity generalizes theories of gravity by _ a priori _ incorporation of the trace of dustlike matter energy  momentum tensor ( @xmath17 ) in addition to the ricci scalar into the lagrangian of geometry .",
    "the reason for the _ a priori _ dependence on @xmath18 may be the inductions arising from some exotic imperfect fluids and/or quantum effects ( e.g. , the conformal anomaly ) , and anyway , the @xmath1 gravity model depends on a source term , while somehow represents the variation of the energy  momentum tensor with respect to the metric . in another word ,",
    "the _ a priori _ appearance of the matter in an unusual coupling with the curvature may also have some relations with the known issues such as , geometrical curvature induction of matter , a geometrical description of physical forces , and a geometrical origin for the matter content of the universe , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein . in this respect ,",
    "whilst we first derive the necessary equations for any arbitrary function of @xmath1 , the main purpose of the work is to concentrate on a simplest and yet the most plausible case of @xmath1 gravity wherein the matter is also minimally coupled to the curvature . then , we obtain the state parameter and the scale factor for this model in the matter dominated and the acceleration phase of the universe . and mainly , we investigate the effect of the cosmic matter and its coupling with geometry in the evolution of the universe in addition to the effect of pure geometry .    on the other side ,",
    "to make our investigations for the acceleration of the universe more instructive , we also scrutinize the motion of the free test particles on their geodesics . in this regard , in the context of relativistic gravitational theories , the curvature of the spacetime plays a fundamental role instead of forces acting in the newtonian theory . on the other hand ,",
    "the einstein field equations tell us how the curvature depends on the matter sources , where one can attain the effects of the curvature in a spacetime through the geodesic deviation equation ( * gde * ) via derivation of the behavior of timelike , null and spacelike geodesics , as have been performed in refs .",
    "indeed , the gde gives the relative acceleration of two adjacent geodesics as a measurable physical quantity , or a way that one can measure the curvature of spacetime ( analogous to the lorentz force law ) , see refs .",
    "moreover , it specifies the tendency of free falling particles to recede or approach to each other while moving under the influence of a varying gravitational field , i.e. there exist internal effective tidal forces that cause the trajectories of free particles to bend away or towards each other .",
    "also , the gde provides a very elegant way of understanding the structure of a spacetime and renders an invariant procedure of characterizing the nature of gravitational forces  @xcite . and",
    "more interesting , this equation contains many important results of standard cosmology such as the raychaudhuri dynamical equation  @xcite , the observer area  distance ( e.g. , the mattig relation for the dust case  @xcite ) , and how perturbations influence the kinematics of null geodesics in resulting gravitational  lensing effects  @xcite and references therein . in this respect , as far as we are concerned , the gde was studied within the spatially flat friedmann ",
