    "log - concave densities on @xmath0 , namely those expressible as the exponential of a concave function that takes values in @xmath12 , form a particularly attractive infinite - dimensional class .",
    "gaussian densities are of course log - concave , as are many other well - known parametric families , such as uniform densities on convex sets , laplace densities and many others .",
    "moreover , the class retains several of the properties of normal densities that make them so widely - used for statistical inference , such as closure under marginalisation , conditioning and convolution operations . on the other hand ,",
    "the set is small enough to allow fully automatic estimation procedures , e.g.  using maximum likelihood , where more traditional nonparametric methods would require troublesome choices of smoothing parameters .",
    "log - concavity therefore offers statisticians the potential of freedom from restrictive parametric ( typically gaussian ) assumptions without paying a hefty price .",
    "indeed , in recent years , researchers have sought to exploit these alluring features to propose new methodology for a wide range of statistical problems , including the detection of the presence of mixing @xcite , tail index estimation @xcite , clustering @xcite , regression @xcite , independent component analysis @xcite and classification @xcite .    however , statistical procedures based on log - concavity , in common with other methods based on shape constraints , present substantial computational and theoretical challenges and these have therefore also been the focus of much recent research . for instance",
    ", the maximum likelihood estimator of a log - concave density , first studied by @xcite in the case @xmath3 , and by @xcite for general @xmath13 , plays a central role in all of the procedures mentioned in the previous paragraph .",
    "@xcite developed a fast , active set algorithm for computing the estimator when @xmath3 , and this is implemented in the * r * package ` logcondens ` @xcite . for general @xmath13 , a slower , non - smooth optimisation method based on shor s @xmath14-algorithm",
    "is implemented in the * r * package ` logconcdead ` @xcite ; see also @xcite for an alternative approximation approach based on interior point methods . on the theoretical side , through a series of papers @xcite , we now have a fairly complete understanding of the global consistency properties of the log - concave maximum likelihood estimator ( even under model misspecification ) .",
    "results on the global rate of convergence in log - concave density estimation are , however , less fully developed , and in particular have been confined to the case @xmath3 . for a fixed true log - concave density @xmath15 belonging to a hlder ball of smoothness",
    "@xmath16 $ ] , @xcite studied the supremum distance over compact intervals in the interior of the support of @xmath15 .",
    "they proved that the log - concave maximum likelihood estimator @xmath17 based on a sample of size @xmath1 converges in these metrics to @xmath15 at rate @xmath18 , where @xmath19 ; thus @xmath17 attains the same rates in the stated regimes as other adaptive nonparametric estimators that do not satisfy the shape constraint .",
    "very recently , @xcite introduced a new bracketing argument to obtain a rate of convergence of @xmath20 in squared hellinger distance in the case @xmath3 , again for a fixed true log - concave density @xmath15 .    in this paper",
    ", we present several new results on global rates of convergence in log - concave density estimation , with a focus on a minimax approach .",
    "we begin by proving , in theorem  [ thm : lowerbound ] in section  [ sec : lowerbounds ] , a non - asymptotic minimax lower bound which shows that for the squared hellinger loss function defined in   below , no statistical procedure based on a sample of size @xmath1 can estimate a log - concave density with supremum risk smaller than order @xmath2 when @xmath21 , and order @xmath4 when @xmath5 .",
    "the surprising feature of this result is that it is often thought that estimation of log - concave densities should be similar to the estimation of densities with two bounded derivatives , for which the minimax rate is known to be @xmath22 for all @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the reasoning for this intuition appears to be aleksandrov s theorem @xcite , which states that a convex function on @xmath0 is twice differentiable ( lebesgue ) almost everywhere in its domain , and the fact that for twice continuously differentiable functions , convexity is equivalent to a second derivative condition , namely that the hessian matrix is non - negative definite . thus , our minimax lower bound reveals that while this intuition is valid when @xmath24 ( note that @xmath25 when @xmath10 ) , log - concave density estimation in three or more dimensions is fundamentally more challenging in this minimax sense than estimating a density with two bounded derivatives .",
    "the second main purpose of this paper is to provide bounds on the supremum risk with respect to the squared hellinger loss function of a particular estimator , namely the log - concave maximum likelihood estimator @xmath17 .",
    "the empirical process theory for studying maximum likelihood estimators is well - known ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but relies on obtaining a bracketing entropy bound , which therefore becomes our main challenge .",
    "a first step is to show that after standardising the data , and using the affine equivariance of the estimator , we can reduce the problem to maximising over a class @xmath26 of log - concave densities having a small mean and covariance matrix close to the identity ( cf .",
    "lemma  [ lemma : threeterms ] in the appendix ) . in corollary",
    "[ cor : transform ] in section  [ subsec : intenv ] , we derive an integrable envelope function for such classes , relying on certain properties of distributional limits of sequences of log - concave densities developed in section  [ subsec : conv ] .",
    "the first part of section  [ sec : bracketing ] is devoted to developing the key bracketing entropy results for the class @xmath26 .",
    "in particular , we show that the @xmath8-bracketing number of @xmath26 in hellinger distance  @xmath27 , denoted @xmath28}(\\epsilon,\\mathcal{g},h)$ ] and defined at the beginning of section  [ sec : bracketing ] , satisfies @xmath29}(\\epsilon,\\mathcal{g},h ) \\gtrsim \\max\\{\\epsilon^{-d/2},\\epsilon^{-(d-1)}\\}.\\ ] ] the second term on the right - hand side of  , which dominates the first when @xmath6 , is somewhat unexpected in view of standard bracketing bounds for classes of convex functions on a compact domain taking values in @xmath30",
    "$ ] ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where only the first term on the right - hand side of  ( [ eq : asymp ] ) appears .",
    "roughly speaking , it arises from the potential complexity of the domains of the log - densities .",
    "moreover , for @xmath7 , we obtain matching upper bounds , up to a logarithmic factor when @xmath10 .",
    "these upper bounds rely on intricate calculations of the bracketing entropy of classes of bounded , concave functions on an arbitrary closed , convex domain .",
    "further details on these bounds can be found in section  [ sec : bracketing ] . in the second part of section  [ sec : bracketing ]",
    ", we apply the bracketing entropy bounds described above to deduce that @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the set of upper semi - continuous , log - concave densities on @xmath0 .",
    "thus , for @xmath7 , the log - concave maximum likelihood estimator attains the minimax optimal rate of convergence with respect to the squared hellinger loss function , up to logarithmic factors when @xmath11 .",
    "the stated rate when @xmath33 is slower in terms of the exponent of @xmath1 than had been conjectured in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and arises as a consequence of the bracketing entropy being of order @xmath34 for this dimension .",
    "it is interesting to note that the logarithmic penalties that appear in   when @xmath35 occur for different reasons .",
    "when @xmath10 , the penalty arises from the logarithmic gap between the lower and upper bounds for the relevant bracketing entropy . when @xmath36 , the bracketing bound is sharp up to multiplicative constants , and the logarithmic penalty is due to the divergence of the bracketing entropy integral that plays the crucial role in the empirical process theory .",
    "the bracketing entropy lower bound in   suggests ( but does not prove ) that the log - concave maximum likelihood estimator will be rate suboptimal for @xmath37 ; indeed , @xcite give an example of a situation where the maximum likelihood estimator has a suboptimal rate of convergence agreeing with that predicted by the same empirical process theory from which we derive our rates .",
    "all of our proofs are deferred to the appendix , where we also give various auxiliary results .",
    "we conclude this section by highlighting some related research on the pointwise rate of convergence of the log - concave maximum likelihood estimator . @xcite",
    "proved that in the case @xmath3 , if @xmath38 and @xmath15 is twice continuously differentiable in a neighbourhood of @xmath39 with @xmath40 , where @xmath41 , then @xmath42 converges to a non - degenerate limiting distribution related to the ` lower invelope ' of an integrated brownian motion process minus a drift term .",
    "@xcite also derived a minimax lower bound for estimation of @xmath43 with respect to absolute error loss of order @xmath44 , provided that @xmath39 is an interior point of the domain of @xmath45 and @xmath45 is locally strongly concave at @xmath39 .",

    "our proof relies on a variant of assouad s cube method ; see , for example , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "we handle the cases @xmath3 and @xmath5 separately . for @xmath3",
    ", we bound the risk below by the risk over a finite subset of @xmath67 consisting of densities that are perturbations of a semicircle @xmath68 ( it is convenient to raise the semicircle to be bounded away from zero on its domain so that the squared hellinger distance can be bounded above in terms of the squared @xmath69-distance ) . the perturbations are constructed by first dividing the upper portion of the semicircle into @xmath70 pairs of arcs , with each element of the pair being a reflection in the @xmath71-axis of the other . for each @xmath72 and @xmath73 , if @xmath74 , the @xmath75th perturbation function @xmath76 replaces the arc in the @xmath77th pair corresponding to @xmath78 with a straight line joining its endpoints and retains the other arc in the pair ; if @xmath79 , we reverse the roles of the two arcs in the pair .",
    "each function @xmath76 is concave on its support @xmath80 $ ] , and is contructed to be a density ; assouad s lemma can therefore be applied .    for @xmath5",
    ", we instead construct uniform densities on perturbations of a closed euclidean ball @xmath81 .",
    "we first start with a constant function on @xmath81 , and find @xmath70 pairs of disjoint caps in @xmath81 .",
    "for @xmath72 and @xmath73 , if @xmath74 , the @xmath75th perturbation function @xmath76 is zero for the first element of the pair , and agrees with the constant function for the second ; if @xmath82 , the roles of the two elements of the pair are again reversed .",
    "since the resulting densities @xmath83 are uniform on sets of the same volume , we can compute hellinger distances between them and again apply assouad s lemma .    as can be seen from the above descriptions , the same lower bounds hold for the ( smaller ) class of upper semi - continuous densities on @xmath0 that are concave on their support ; indeed , for @xmath5 , the lower bounds hold even for the class of uniform densities on a closed , convex domain .",
    "since the domains in our construction are perturbations of a euclidean ball , the problem is rather similar to that of estimating a convex body based on a sample of size @xmath1 with respect to the nikodym distance , defined as the lebesgue measure of the symmetric difference of two sets .",
    "for this latter problem , the rate of @xmath4 has also been obtained @xcite .",
    "an inspection of our proof further reveals that a minimax lower bound can also be obtained for the @xmath84 loss function .",
