    "in @xcite , stan wagon provides us with 14 proofs of the fact that if a rectangle @xmath0 is tiled with rectangles , each having at least one side of integral length , then @xmath0 has a side of integral length .    rather than simply add a fifteenth proof to his list",
    ", we would like to address the much more general problem of tileability of arbitrary rectilinear polygons .",
    "in particular we will give an algorithm for deciding when a rectilinear polygon ( that is , a polygon with sides parallel to the axes ) can be tiled with rectangles , each having an integer side .",
    "the proof idea comes from a neat method , due to john conway in the case of polyominos , for dealing with tiling problems of this sort .",
    "that method is to define a group , the `` tiling group '' which depends on the set of tiles involved in the particular problem , and gives a necessary condition for the tileability of a given simply connected region .",
    "this method has been used with success in many cases where the tiles have simple shapes ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . here",
    "we apply it to wagon s problem .",
    "surprisingly , the method resembles closely that of @xcite ( or @xcite ) in the case of dominos .",
    "one corollary to our construction is a simple description of the set of all possible tilings of a polygon @xmath0 ( theorem [ rotate ] ) .",
    "rather than define the tiling group we will simply use one of its quotient groups ; this will be sufficient for our purposes . for background into defining the tiling group in a more",
    "general setting see the references .",
    "let @xmath1 denote the group @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath3 , the free ( nonabelian ) product of @xmath1 with itself .",
    "do nt let the size or topology on this group worry you . despite being non - locally compact , it is a rather easy group to work with .",
    "an element of @xmath4 is a product of elements in one or the other factor , for example a typical element is @xmath5 where the symbols @xmath6 refer to elements of the first or second free factor , respectively .",
    "an element of @xmath4 can be written in * reduced form * using the ( confluent ) identities @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 ( the identity ) .",
    "the reduced form of an element is either @xmath10 or an alternating sequence of @xmath11 s and @xmath12 s , where the @xmath13 ( the element can start and end in either an @xmath14 or a @xmath15 ) .",
    "multiplication in @xmath4 is just concatenation of the corresponding expressions .    to a rectilinear polygonal path @xmath16 starting from the origin we associate an element of @xmath4 as follows",
    ". the path @xmath16 is an ordered sequence of horizontal and vertical edges ; to a horizontal edge of `` length '' @xmath17 ( that is an edge from a point with @xmath18-coordinate @xmath19 to a point with @xmath18-coordinate @xmath20 ) we associate the element @xmath11 . for a vertical edge from @xmath21-coordinate @xmath22 to @xmath21-coordinate @xmath23 we associate the element @xmath12",
    ". then the element of @xmath4 corresponding to a path is just the product of the elements coming from the sequence of horizontal and vertical edges of that path .",
    "for example , the path running counterclockwise around the boundary of a @xmath24 rectangle with the origin in its lower left corner is : @xmath25    for a simple rectilinear polygon @xmath0 having the origin on its boundary , let @xmath26 be the element of @xmath4 corresponding to the path running counterclockwise around the boundary of @xmath0 .    if @xmath0 is tileable with rectangles , each having an integer side , then @xmath27 in @xmath4 .",
    "[ trivialing ]    * proof . *",
    "a tiling of @xmath0 gives a representation of @xmath26 as a product of `` lassos '' , i.e. words of the form @xmath28 ( conjugates of @xmath29 $ ] ) , where the words @xmath29 $ ] are the boundaries of the tiles : this can be proved inductively on the number of tiles , taking at the inductive step a tile touching @xmath30 ( figure [ lassos ] ) , see also @xcite .",
    "since each tile has an integral side , for each lasso @xmath31x^{-1}$ ] , one of @xmath32 is integral and so the lasso is trivial in @xmath4 .",
    "thus @xmath26 is the product of trivial elements of @xmath4 and so is trivial .",
    "this lemma is a necessary condition for tileability of a region by integer - sided rectangles .",
    "it is not sufficient , as can be seen by considering for example the ( untileable ) polygon whose boundary word is @xmath33    if a @xmath24 rectangle @xmath0 is tileable with integer - sided rectangles , then either @xmath34 or @xmath35 .    *",
    "the element @xmath36 is trivial if and only if either @xmath37 or @xmath38 , that is , if and",
    "only if @xmath39 or @xmath40 .    we leave the reader to compare this proof with those of @xcite .",
    "we give here an algorithm for deciding if a given simply rectilinear polygon @xmath0 can be tiled with integer - sided rectangles .",

    "for example , the word in ( [ rect ] ) has length @xmath44 assuming neither @xmath45 nor @xmath46 is integral .",
    "let @xmath47 be the following base point : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is sufficiently large so that @xmath50 is far away from @xmath26 and any of its prefixes .",
    "we have @xmath51 .",
    "we define a height function @xmath52 on @xmath30 as follows .",

    "let @xmath53 , and @xmath54 be the path around @xmath0 counterclockwise from @xmath55 to @xmath21 . then define @xmath56 .    since @xmath27 , we have @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the path from @xmath55 to @xmath21 going around @xmath0 clockwise instead ( @xmath54 and @xmath58 are the same element of @xmath4 ) . similarly ,",
    "if @xmath0 is tiled by integer - sided rectangles , we can extend @xmath52 to a height function on all of the edges in the tiling : define @xmath52 on a point @xmath21 on an interior edge by simply taking any path @xmath59 along tile boundaries from the origin to that point ; then @xmath60 is independent of the path @xmath59 taken since for each tile the path around its boundary is trivial in @xmath4",
    ".    * remark .",
    "* note that on an edge @xmath61 almost all the points have the same @xmath52-value .",
    "the exceptions are points whose @xmath52-value is one less ; these points occur at distance exactly @xmath62 apart on @xmath61 .",
    "to tile the region @xmath0 , we use the following result .",
    "if @xmath0 is tileable , there is a tiling in which the maximum of @xmath52 occurs on the boundary of @xmath0 .",
    "[ maxonbdy ]    * proof . *",
    "suppose we have a tiling and the maximum is at a point @xmath18 on an edge @xmath61 in the interior of @xmath0 .",
    "suppose without loss that @xmath61 is vertical .",
    "let @xmath63 be a horizontal edge meeting @xmath61 at a point @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath64 then points on @xmath63 are higher than @xmath18 , contradicting our choice of @xmath18 .",
    "so @xmath65 .",
    "by the remark which precedes this lemma , every horizontal edge meeting @xmath61 is at an integer distance from @xmath21 .",
    "in particular the gap between adjacent horizontal edges has integral length .",
    "so each rectangle adjacent to @xmath61 has integral height .",
    "subdivide these rectangles using horizontal segments at each height which is an integral distance from @xmath21 ( figure [ maxedge]b ) .",
    "this divides each rectangle adjacent to @xmath61 into other rectangles of height @xmath62 .",
    "now remove the edge @xmath61 completely ; this has the effect of combining pairs of rectangles left and right of @xmath61 into single rectangles of height @xmath62 ( figure [ maxedge]c ) .",
    "so we have a new tiling with integer - sided rectangles . on each edge we added ,",
    "the points are at a strictly lower height than @xmath18 .    by repeating this process for each interior edge which contains a point of maximal height",
    ", we eventually decrease the maximum in the interior .",
    "since the maximum takes integer values , eventually we find a tiling with the maximum on the boundary .",
    "furthermore there is a tiling in which points on interior edges are _ strictly _ lower than the boundary maximum .",
    "this lemma gives us an algorithm for tiling .",
    "first compute @xmath52 on the boundary of @xmath0 . by lemma [ trivialing ]",
    ", it is well - defined .",
    "find the maximum and minimum of @xmath52 on the boundary of @xmath0 .",
    "if the maximum minus the minimum is @xmath62 , then all edges have integral length , and so it is easy to tile .",
    "suppose the maximal height difference is at least @xmath66 . by the remark preceding lemma [ maxonbdy ] , the maximum height occurs on a boundary edge @xmath67 of integer length .",
    "assume without loss that @xmath67 is vertical .",
    "put in as first tile a rectangle @xmath68 of side @xmath67 and width @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the smaller of :    1 .   the smallest value",
    "for which the height of all points on the edge @xmath71 of @xmath68 opposite @xmath67 ( extending @xmath52 to @xmath72 ) is less than the maximum height , 2 .",
    "the smallest value at which the edge @xmath71 opposite @xmath67 touches the boundary of @xmath0 at a point on the interior of the edge @xmath71 .",
    "we claim that if there is a tiling of @xmath0 , there is a tiling in which this rectangle @xmath73 is a tile . by the lemma",
    ", there exists a tiling with the maximum at @xmath67 whose interior edges are lower than @xmath67 .",
    "the rectangles adjacent to @xmath67 in this tiling must have integer height , with their horizontal edges meeting @xmath67 at integer distance from the two vertices of @xmath67 ( since the horizontal edges must be lower than @xmath67 ) .",
    "furthermore these rectangles have widths at least as large as @xmath69 since their vertical edges opposite @xmath67 either have height lower than @xmath67 or touch the boundary .",
    "so in such a tiling we can cut off each of these tiles at distance @xmath69 from @xmath67 so that the added rectangle @xmath68 is a tile in a tiling of @xmath0 .",
    "so we can now continue with the remaining untiled region @xmath74 .",
    "it may be that @xmath73 has several components ; however each component is still simply connected , so we run the algorithm in each component separately . on each component , for a tiling to exist the height function must be well - defined , that is , the heights on new edges of @xmath68 must agree with the heights at points where they touch @xmath30 .",
    "in either case @xmath62 or @xmath66 above in our choice of @xmath69 , the total length of boundary edges where the height is maximal has decreased by an integer amount : in case @xmath62 it has decreased by the length of @xmath67 , and in case @xmath66 it has decreased by the length of @xmath75 which must be a positive integer .    so after a finite number of added rectangles the maximum on the various boundaries has decreased . since the minimum has not changed , the maximal height difference on each boundary has now decreased .",
    "continue until this difference is equal to @xmath62 on each component .",
    "then the boundary must have all edges of integral length and so can be trivially tiled .",
    "this completes the algorithm .",
    "[ alg ]    * example .",
    "* in the polygon @xmath0 of figure [ poly ] , the counterclockwise path from @xmath10 to @xmath21 is the word @xmath76 and the clockwise path from @xmath10 to @xmath21 is @xmath77 these are equal in @xmath4 so @xmath27 .",
    "the heights ( assuming the height of the first edge is @xmath62 ) are indicated on the boundary ( the height labelling an edge is the largest height of points on that edge ) . the lowest tiling is shown in the first figure , the highest in the second .",
    "the heights on interior edges are as shown .",
    "our algorithm would construct the first tiling .",
    "a consequence of the local rearrangement of tiles as in lemma [ maxonbdy ] and this algorithm is :    any two tilings of a polygon can be obtained from one another by a sequence of the two types of operations : * ( 1 ) * subdividing a tile into two tiles along an edge of integer length , * ( 2 ) * coalescing two tiles which share a common edge of integer length into one tile by removing that edge .",
    "[ rotate ]    * proof . *",
    "define a tiling @xmath78 which is that constructed by the algorithm , except do nt stop when all the edges are integral but continue to apply the algorithm as before .",
    "once all the edges are integral or half - integral , they remain so by our definition of base point @xmath50 .",
    "so each rectangle added from this point on takes up at least area @xmath79 , and thus the algorithm terminates after a finite number of steps .",
    "we claim any tiling @xmath80 can be transformed using operations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) to this tiling @xmath78 . by the lemma we can transform @xmath80 until the interior edges have heights strictly less than the boundary maximum .",
    "take a highest edge @xmath67 on @xmath30 as before .",
    "we can now transform @xmath80 so that @xmath68 , the rectangle added in the algorithm , is a rectangle of @xmath80 : each rectangle adjacent to @xmath67 has integral height , and so can be subdivided into two legal rectangles with a vertical edge at distance @xmath69 from @xmath67 .",
    "then removing the horizontal edges which cut through @xmath68 leaves the tile @xmath68 .",
    "the proof is then completed by induction on the number of tiles of @xmath78 .",
    "the preceding algorithm gives a bonus in the case of tiling a polyomino .",
    "suppose we want to tile a simply connected polyomino with rectangles , each of which has a side of length @xmath81 .",
    "the algorithm of section [ alg ] has the property that the other side - lengths of the tiles used are in the lattice generated by the edge lengths of @xmath0 . in the case of polyominoes ,",
    "this lattice is just @xmath82 , and so the algorithm yields in this case a tiling with bars of length @xmath83 and @xmath84 .    by stretching the vertical coordinate we can also similarly solve the case of tiling with @xmath83 and @xmath85 bars .",
    "this case was previously solved by a similar algorithm in @xcite .",
    "our algorithm runs in time linear in the area .",
    "let @xmath86 be an arbitrary subgroup of @xmath87 and let @xmath88 be the set of rectangles with at least one side in @xmath86 .",
    "our algorithm also works to tile with tiles in @xmath88 . in this case",
    "the group @xmath89 loses all of its irrelevant topology ( which was implicit but not explicit in our understanding of @xmath90 ) , but what remains is the word metric coming from the distance function @xmath91 which is still well - defined .",
    "the proofs of the lemmas extend easily to this case . for the rest of the algorithm ,",
    "if @xmath86 is not discrete then the choice of width @xmath69 of the added tile is not well - defined .",
    "however we can take any @xmath69 sufficiently small so that the tile @xmath68 encounters no other vertex of @xmath0 , and such that @xmath71 has lower height than @xmath67 .",
    "we again continue with the untiled region until the boundary height difference is @xmath62 , in which case all the edges are in @xmath86 , and so tiling is trivial ."
