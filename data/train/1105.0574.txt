    "for @xmath0 a parry number , boyd @xcite introduced the notion of the beta - conjugates of @xmath1 in the context of the rnyi - parry numeration system @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "as he has shown it in numerous examples , the investigation of beta - conjugates is an important question .",
    "these beta - conjugates , up till now defined for parry numbers , are canonically associated to @xmath1 and to the dynamics of the beta - transformation . our aim is to show that their definition can be given in a larger context , namely for any algebraic number @xmath0 , and that the theory of puiseux provides a geometric origin to the beta - conjugates of @xmath1 ; for doing it , once @xmath1 is given by its minimal polynomial , we first put into evidence that a germ of curve  at @xmath5 \" does exist and develop new tools deduced from the canonical decomposition of this germ in order to express the beta - conjugates of @xmath1 in terms of the puiseux expansions @xcite @xcite of the germ .    though the existence of this germ of curve was discovered by the author some years ago",
    ", the present note is the first account on it and its potential applications .",
    "it establishes a deep relation between the theory of singularities of curves in algebraic geometry and the dynamical system of numeration @xmath6 , t_{\\beta})$ ] where @xmath0 is an algebraic number and @xmath7 is the beta - transformation .",
    "the existence of this germ of curve brings new tools to the rnyi - parry numeration system , namely the puiseux series associated to the germ , and defines new directions of research for old questions .",
    "for instance , if @xmath8 is a sequence of salem numbers which converges to a real number @xmath1 , then it is known @xcite that @xmath1 is a pisot or a salem number , but how is distributed the collection of the beta - conjugates and the galois conjugates of @xmath9 , with @xmath10 large enough , with respect to that of the limit @xmath1 ?",
    "this question is merely a generalization of the classical question of how is distributed the collection of the galois conjugates of @xmath9 with respect to that of @xmath1 ? why should we add the beta - conjugates ? because a new phenomenon appears which generally does not exist with only the galois conjugates",
    ": under some assumptions the collections of galois- and beta- conjugates may have equidistribution limit properties on the unit circle (  3.6 in @xcite ) if the two collections of conjugates are simultaneously considered .",
    "both collections of conjugates are expected to play a role in limit and dynamical properties of convergent sequences of real algebraic numbers @xmath11 in general .",
    "a basic question is then to understand the role and the relative density of the beta - conjugates in this possible equidistribution process , in particular if the limit @xmath1 is an integer @xmath12 or is equal to @xmath13 ( context of the conjecture of lehmer ) .    conversely the curve canonically associated with this numeration dynamical system is of interest for itself ( critical points , monodromy , ... ) .",
    "it will be studied elsewhere .    in this first contribution",
    "we obtain useful expressions for the beta - conjugates as puiseux expansions of @xmath1 and of the minimal polynomial of @xmath1 , towards this goal .    as usual",
    "now we use the new terminology , which is in honor of w. parry . the old terminology used by w.",
    "parry himself in @xcite transforms as follows : we now call _ parry number _ a @xmath1-number @xcite , and _ parry polynomial _ of a parry number @xmath1 the characteristic polynomial @xcite of the @xmath1-number @xmath1 . as previously a _",
    "simple _ parry number @xmath1 is a parry number @xmath1 for which the rnyi @xmath1-expansion @xmath14 of unity is finite ( i.e. ends in infinitely many zeros ) .",
    "the exact definitions are given in section [ s3 ] .",
    "if @xmath1 is a parry number , the roots of the parry polynomial of @xmath1 , denoted by @xmath15 , are called the conjugates of @xmath1 .",
    "a conjugate of @xmath1 is either a galois conjugate of @xmath1 or a beta - conjugate , if the collection of beta - conjugates of @xmath1 is not empty .",
    "let @xmath0 be a real number and @xmath16 be the rnyi @xmath1-expansion of 1 .",
    "since this rnyi @xmath1-expansion of 1 controls the language in base @xmath1 @xcite , the properties of the analytic function constructed from it , called parry upper function at @xmath1 , defined by @xmath17 , is of particular importance .",
    "ito and takahashi @xcite have shown that the parry upper function at a parry number @xmath1 , of the complex variable @xmath18 , is related to the ( artin - mazur ) dynamical zeta function @xmath19   \\mid t_{\\beta}^n(x ) = x\\}}{n } z^n\\right)\\ ] ] of the beta - transformation @xmath7 ( artin and mazur @xcite , boyd @xcite , flatto , lagarias and poonen @xcite , verger - gaugry @xcite @xcite ) .",

    "the set of zeros of @xmath2 is the set @xmath32 of the reciprocals of the conjugates @xmath33 of @xmath1 .",
    "the geometry of the conjugates @xmath33 of @xmath1 was carefully studied by solomyak @xcite @xcite : these conjugates all lie in solomyak s fractal @xmath34 , a compact connected subset of the closed disc @xmath35 in the complex plane ( figure [ fractalsolo ] ) , having a cusp at @xmath36 , a spike on the negative real axis , symmetrical with respect to the real line @xcite @xcite .",
    "if @xmath0 is an algebraic number but not a parry number , some relations are expected between @xmath2 and @xmath4 , though not yet determined .",
    "indeed , on one hand , @xmath2 is an analytic function on the open unit disc which admits @xmath37 as natural boundary by szeg - carlson - poly s theorem @xcite @xcite ; @xmath2 admits @xmath5 as zero of multiplicity one , which is its only zero in the interval @xmath38 . on the other hand @xmath4",

    "the behaviour of the dynamical zeta function @xmath4 on the unit circle remains unknown , i.e. we do not know whether @xmath37 is a natural boundary for @xmath4 or not .",
    "but the multiplicity of the pole @xmath5 of @xmath4 is known to be one @xcite @xcite @xcite . for @xmath0 an algebraic number , as a consequence of theorem 1 in @xcite , the coefficients in obey the following asymptotics of growth ( pollicott ,  5.2 in @xcite ) : for any @xmath41 there exist an integer @xmath42 and constants @xmath43 , with @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , such that @xmath46 \\mid t_{\\beta}^n(x ) = x\\ } ~=~   \\sum_{i=1}^{m } c_{i,\\beta } \\lambda_{i,\\beta}^{n } + o((1+\\delta)^n).\\ ] ] in the case where @xmath0 is a parry number",

    "moreover , @xmath1 is a perron number since it is a parry number ( lind , @xcite ) : hence the asymptotic growth of is dictated by the geometry and the moduli of the beta - conjugates of @xmath1 , all being algebraic integers lying in solomyak s fractal @xmath34 , of modulus less than or equal to @xmath52 , and by the geometry and the moduli of the galois conjugates of @xmath1 , all being less than @xmath1 , by definition .",
    "our objective consists in showing that a germ of curve exists in a neighbourhood of the point @xmath53 in @xmath54 ( this point being the origin of this germ ) each time @xmath0 is a real algebraic number , that is , roughly speaking , a germ of curve located at the reciprocal @xmath5 of the base of numeration @xmath1 .",
    "the construction of this germ of curve comes from a ( unique ) writting of the one - variable analytic function @xmath2 as a ( unique ) two - variable analytic function parametrized by @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the reciprocal of the minimal polynomial @xmath58 of @xmath1 : @xmath59 where @xmath60[z]$ ] , deg@xmath61deg @xmath1 , is convergent , with coefficients in @xmath62 , possibly in some cases in the algebraic number field @xmath63 , or in a finite algebraic extension of @xmath64 .",
    "the existence of this germ of curve arises from the fact that @xmath0 is a real number which is an algebraic number , since it is constructed from the imposed parametrization @xmath65 , which makes use of the minimal polynomial of @xmath1 .",
    "this parametrization of @xmath66 leads to the identity .",
    "applying the theory of puiseux @xcite @xcite to provides a canonical decomposition of this germ into irreducible curves , conjugacy classes , as stated in theorem [ puiseuxfbeta ] .",
    "this decomposition brings to light several new features of the parry upper function @xmath2 :    \\(i ) a new definition of the beta - conjugates of @xmath1 in terms of the puiseux expansions of the germ ( definition [ betaconjugatepuiseuxfbetanewdef ] ) ,    \\(ii ) the explicit relations between the field of coefficients of the puiseux series of the germ @xmath67 , and the beta - conjugates ,    \\(iii ) a product formula , as given by ; in particular , if @xmath1 is a parry number , from and , this product gives an analog of the euler product of the riemann zeta function for the dynamical zeta function @xmath4 , where the product is taken over the different rational conjugacy classes of the germ ( as given by ) .",
    "in addition to the usual galois conjugation relating the roots of the minimal polynomial of @xmath1 , a new conjugation relation , called  puiseux - conjugation \" , among the beta - conjugates , is defined .",
    "the reader accustomed to numeration systems and to the theory of puiseux for germs of curves can skip section [ s3 ] and section [ s4 ] to proceed directly to beta - conjugates in section [ s5 ] .",
    "the present note finds its origin in @xcite , for the parametrization by @xmath68 , and in the two articles @xcite @xcite , for the idea of developping a two - variable analytic function canonically associated with the beta - transformation and the minimal polynomial of the base of numeration @xmath1 .",
