    "completely positive , trace - preserving maps arise naturally in quantum information theory and other situations in which one wishes to restrict attention to a quantum system that should properly be considered a subsystem of a larger system with which it interacts . in such situations ,",
    "the system of interest is described by a hilbert space @xmath2 and the larger system by a tensor product @xmath3 .",
    "states correspond to density matrices , where a density matrix @xmath4 is a positive semi - definite operator on @xmath2 with @xmath5 .",
    "the result of the `` noisy '' interaction with the larger system is described by a _ stochastic _",
    "map @xmath6 that takes @xmath4 to another density matrix @xmath7",
    ". since @xmath7 should also be a density matrix , @xmath8 must be both trace - preserving and positivity preserving .",
    "however , the latter is not enough , since @xmath7 is the result of a positivity - preserving process on the larger space of operators in @xmath9 .",
    "this is precisely the condition that @xmath8 be completely positive .",
    "the notion of complete positivity was introduced in the more general context of linear maps @xmath10 on @xmath11-algebras where the condition can be stated as the requirement that @xmath12 is positivity preserving for all @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes the algebra of complex @xmath15 matrices .",
    "stinespring showed that a completely positive map always has a representation of the form @xmath16 = v^ * \\pi_1(a ) v$ ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are representations of the algebras @xmath19 respectively .",
    "kraus @xcite and choi @xcite showed that this leads to the more tangible condition that there exists a set of operators @xmath20 such that [ eq : kraus ] ( ) = _ k a_k^ a_k .",
    "( where we henceforth follow the physics convention of using @xmath21 to denote the adjoint of an operator . )",
    "the condition that @xmath8 is trace - preserving can then be written as @xmath22 . when this condition is also satisfied , ( [ eq : kraus ] )",
    "can also be used @xcite to find a representation of @xmath8 in terms of a partial trace on a larger space .",
    "the operators in ( [ eq : kraus ] ) are often referred to as `` kraus operators '' because of his influential work @xcite on quantum measurement in which he emphasized the role of completely positive maps .",
    "recognition that such maps play a natural role in the description of quantum systems goes back at least to haag and kastler @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that this representation is highly non - unique , and that this non - uniqueness can not be eliminated by simple constraints . in particular",
    ", one can find extreme maps with at least two two different kraus representations each of which uses only the minimal number of kraus operators .",
    "an example is given in section [ sect : capac ] .",
    "the representation ( [ eq : kraus ] ) was obtained independently by choi @xcite in connection with important tests , upon which this paper is based , for complete - positivity and extremality in the case of maps on @xmath14 .    however , choi s condition and all of the representations discussed above require , at least implicitly , consideration of the map @xmath23 on a larger space .",
    "( in quantum information theory this problem is sometimes avoided by defining a stochastic map , or channel , in terms of its kraus operators as in ( [ eq : kraus ] ) ; however , this approach has thus tended to focus attention on a rather limited set of channels . )",
    "one would like to find a simple way to characterize completely positive maps in terms of their action on the algebra @xmath24 of the subsystem .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to obtain such a characterization in the special case of trace - preserving maps on @xmath25 .",
    "this leads to a complete description of their extreme points , and a useful parameterization of the stochastic maps and their extreme points .",
    "although the two - dimensional case @xmath26 may seem rather special , it is of considerable importance because of its role in quantum computation and quantum communication .",
    "if , in addition to being trace - preserving , a completely positive map @xmath8 is unital , i.e. , @xmath27 , we call @xmath8 _ bistochastic_. this terminology for maps that are both unital and stochastic was introduced in @xcite",
    ".      first , we note that for a linear map @xmath8 , its adjoint , which we denote @xmath28 ( to avoid confusion with the operator adjoint of a specific image ) can be defined with respect to the hilbert - schmidt inner product @xmath29 so that @xmath30^{\\dg } b = \\tr \\ , a^{\\dg } \\wh{\\phi}(b)$ ] .",
    "it is easy to verify that the kraus operators for @xmath28 are the adjoints of those for @xmath8 so that ( [ eq : kraus ] ) implies @xmath31 , and that @xmath8 is trace - preserving if and only if @xmath32 , i.e. , if @xmath28 is unital .    in order to state our results in a useful form , we recall that the identity and pauli matrices @xmath33 form a basis for @xmath34 where @xmath35 every density matrix can be written in this basis as @xmath36 $ ] with @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    ". thus , the set of density matrices , which we shall denote by @xmath39 , can be identified with the unit ball in @xmath40 and the pure states ( rank one projections ) lie on the surface known as the `` bloch sphere . ''",
    "since @xmath8 is a linear map on @xmath34 , it can also be represented in this basis by a unique @xmath41 matrix @xmath42 , and @xmath8 is trace - preserving if and only if the first row satisfies @xmath43 , i.e. , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a @xmath46 matrix ( and @xmath47 and @xmath48 are row and column vectors respectively ) so that @xmath49 the @xmath42-matrix corresponding to @xmath28 is @xmath50 .    when @xmath8 is also positivity - preserving , it maps the subspace of self - adjoint matrices in @xmath34 into itself , which implies that @xmath51 is real .",
    "king and ruskai @xcite showed that any such map can be reduced , via changes of basis in @xmath52 , to the form [ eq : trep ] * t * = . because a unitary change of basis @xmath53 on @xmath52 is equivalent to a 3-dimensional rotation @xmath54 acting on the pauli matrices ,",
    "this is equivalent to [ eq : krpolars ] ( ) = u u^ , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 denotes the map corresponding to ( [ eq : trep ] ) .",
    "the reduction to ( [ eq : trep ] ) is obtained by applying a modification of the singular value decomposition to the @xmath57 real matrix @xmath45 corresponding to the restriction of @xmath8 to the subspace of matrices with zero trace .",
    "however , the constraint that the diagonalization is achieved using rotations rather than arbitrary real orthogonal matrices forces us to relax the usual requirement that the @xmath58 be positive ( so that one can only say that @xmath59 are singular values of @xmath45 ) .",
    "see appendix a of @xcite for details and appendix c for some examples and discussion of subtle issues regarding the signs of @xmath58 .",
    "( this decomposition is not unique ; the parameters can be permuted and the signs of any _ two _ of the @xmath58 can be changed by conjugating with a pauli matrix .",
    "only the sign of the product @xmath60 is fixed .",
    "the canonical example of a positivity preserving map which is not completely positive , the transpose , corresponds to @xmath58 taking the values @xmath61 .",
    "hence it may be surprising that the product @xmath60 can be negative , as in example 2(b ) of section [ sect : boundary ] , and the sign of this product has an impact on the allowed values of the translation parameters @xmath62 . )    we call a stochastic map @xmath8 _ unitary _ if @xmath63 and sometimes write @xmath64",
    ". it is easy to check that the kraus representation of a unitary stochastic map is ( essentially ) unique , and ( [ eq : krpolars ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath65 .",
    "we are interested here in the ( convex ) set @xmath66 of stochastic maps , i.e. , those @xmath8 that satisfy the stronger condition of complete positivity .",
    "the crucial point about the reduction ( [ eq : krpolars ] ) is that @xmath8 is completely positive if and only if @xmath67 is .",
    "thus , the question of characterizing stochastic maps reduces to studying matrices of the form ( [ eq : trep ] ) under the assumption that @xmath68 ( which is necessary for @xmath8 to be positivity preserving ) . of course",
    ", this reduction is not necessarily unique when the @xmath58 s are not distinct ; this will be discussed further in section [ sect : subclass ] .",
    "the image of the bloch sphere of pure states under a map of the form ( [ eq : trep ] ) is the ellipsoid [ eq : ellip ] ( ) ^2 + ( ) ^2 + ( ) ^2 = 1 so that eigenvalues @xmath58 define the length of the axes of the ellipsoid and the vector @xmath48 its center .",
    "the bloch sphere picture of images as ellipsoids is useful because it allows one to determine geometrically the states that emerge with minimal entropy and , roughly , the states associated with maximal capacity .",
    "note that a trace preserving map is positivity - preserving if and only if it maps the bloch sphere into the  bloch ball \" , defined as the bloch sphere plus its interior . however , not all ellipsoids contained in the  bloch ball \" correspond to images of a stochastic map @xmath8 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the @xmath58 s are limited by the inequalities @xmath69 . however , even for most allowable choices of @xmath58 , complete positivity restricts ( often rather severely ) the extent to which translation of the ellipsoid is possible . moreover , characterizing the allowable ellipsoids is not equivalent to characterizing all stochastic maps because ( [ eq : ellip ] ) depends only on @xmath59 while the actual conditions restrict the choice of signs of @xmath58 as well .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that complete positivity is an extremely strong condition .",
    "in fact whether the map is stochastic or not depends on the position and orientation of that ellipsoid inside the bloch sphere and there are many ellipsoids within the bloch sphere that do _ not _ correspond to a completely positive map .    for bistochastic maps ,",
    "the extreme points are known @xcite to consist of the maps that conjugate by a unitary matrix and , in the @xmath58 representation , correspond to four corners of a tetrahedron .",
    "the maps on the edges of the tetrahedron correspond to ellipsoids that have exactly two points in common with the boundary of the bloch sphere .",
    "these maps play a special role and it is useful to consider them as _ quasi - extreme points_. we sometimes call the closure of the set of extreme points the set of the _ generalized extreme points _ and we then refer to those points that are generalized , but not true , extreme points as quasi - extreme points .",
    "we will see that for non - unital maps the extreme points correspond to those maps for which the translation allows the ellipsoid to touch the boundary of the sphere at two points ( provided one interprets a single point as a pair of degenerate ones in certain special cases . ) this is discussed in more detail in section [ sect : boundary ] .",
    "we now summarize our results for maps of the form ( [ eq : trep ] ) . for such maps , it is easy to verify that a necessary condition for @xmath8 to be positivity - preserving is that @xmath70 for @xmath71 .",
    "[ thm : cpcond ] a map @xmath8 given by ( [ eq : trep ] ) for which @xmath72 is completely positive if and only if the equation @xmath73 has a solution @xmath74 that is a contraction .",

    ", it would suffice to let @xmath81 .",
    "however , this matrix is singular . since the solution to ( [ eq : rphi.cond ] )",
    "is not unique in this case , it will be more convenient to define @xmath82 by the non - singular matrix [ eq : eql.mtrx ] r _ = .",
    "if @xmath83 and @xmath77 , then @xmath84 in which case @xmath8 will not be completely positive unless @xmath85 ; then it is consistent and sufficient to interpret @xmath86 so that @xmath87 .",

    "this was originally obtained @xcite as a necessary condition for complete positivity under the _ assumption _ that @xmath8 has the form ( [ eq : trep ] ) with the additional constraint @xmath78 .",
    "moreover , it follows that a _ necessary _",

    "this is a strong constraint that necessarily excludes many unitary @xmath108 matrices . that such a constrained subclass of unitary matrices can eventually yield all extreme points",

    "it is straightforward to verify that in this parameterization @xmath8 can be realized with the kraus operators [ eq : kraus.trig ] a_+ & = & i + _ z +  &   & + a_- & = & _ x - i _ y .",
    "the rationale behind the subscripts @xmath115 should be clear when we compute the products @xmath116 in section [ sect : proof ] .",
    "a similar parameterization was obtained by niu and griffiths @xcite in their work on two - bit copying devices .",
    "one generally regards noise as the result of failure to adequately control interactions with the environment .",
    "however , even classically , noise can also arise as the result of deliberate `` jamming '' or as the inadvertent result of eavesdropping as in , e.g. , wire - tapping .",
    "one advantage to quantum communication is that protocols involving non - orthogonal signals provide protection against undetected eavesdropping .",
    "any attempt to intercept and duplicate the signal results leads to errors that may then appear as noise to the receiver .",
    "the work of niu and griffiths @xcite suggests that the extreme points of the form ( [ eq : ttrig ] ) can be regarded as arising from an eavesdropper trying to simultaneously optimize information intercepted and minimize detectable effects in an otherwise noiseless channel .",
    "this parameterization was also obtained independently by rieffel and zalka @xcite who , like niu and griffiths , considered maps that arise via interactions between a pair of qubits , i.e. , maps defined by linear extension of [ eq : lind ] ( e_1 ) = t_2 u ( e_1 e_2 ) u^ where @xmath117 denotes the partial trace , @xmath97 is a unitary matrix in @xmath118 and @xmath119 denotes a projection onto a pure state in @xmath120 .",

    "one might conjecture , as lloyd @xcite did , that any map in @xmath66 can be represented in the form ( [ eq : lind ] ) if @xmath125 is replaced with a mixed state @xmath126 .",
    "however , terhal , et al @xcite showed that this is false and another counter - example was obtained in @xcite .",
    "this does not contradict lindblad s representation in @xcite because his construction requires that the second hilbert space have dimension equal to the number of kraus operators .",
    "thus , a map that requires four kraus operators is only guaranteed to have a representation of the form ( [ eq : lind ] ) on @xmath127 .",
    "our results will be based on the following fundamental result of choi @xcite .",

    "this corresponds to a depolarizing channel in which case @xmath8 maps the unit ball into a sphere of radius @xmath334 which can then be translated in _ any _ direction with @xmath335 .",
    "similar remarks hold when one @xmath336 and the other two @xmath337 , since conjugating a stochastic map with one of the pauli matrices , yields another stochastic map with the signs of any _ two _ @xmath58 changed .",

    "@xmath74 , is always a contraction , but is unitary only for @xmath342 .",
    "however , the condition @xmath340 implies that the north or south pole is a fixed point .",

    "if @xmath344 holds with exactly one sign , then @xmath345 lie on the surface of the tetrahedron defined by ( ii ) , but on the interior of one of the four faces .",
    "however , even when equality holds with only one sign , ( [ eq : afcond ] ) implies that @xmath304 so that no translation is possible . thus , one can find maps with all @xmath230 for which the image @xmath285 is an ellipsoid strictly contained within the unit ball but no translation in any direction is possible .",
    "a map with @xmath346 is _ not _ completely positive unless @xmath347 .",
    "however , unlike the case with @xmath348 , such maps can not be translated to the boundary ; in fact , for @xmath349 , one must have @xmath304 so that no translation is possible .",
    "3 .   when @xmath350 which implies @xmath351 and the image of @xmath8 is a circle in a plane parallel to the equator .",
    "moreover , the equations following ( [ eq : afcond.gen ] ) imply 4 ^2 ( 1 -    @xmath352 no translation the image @xmath285 is possible despite the fact that the ellipsoid has shrunk to a flat disk of radius @xmath353 .",
    "for @xmath354 translation is possible , but clearly never reaches the boundary of pure states .",
    "example ( 2a ) includes maps with @xmath355 , @xmath356 , which may seem to contradict example ( 1b ) .",
    "however , the condition @xmath357 is never satisfied since if would imply @xmath358 . hence the conditions for these two examples do not overlap .    example ( 2b ) illustrates that the ellipsoid picture , while useful , is incomplete . the eigenvalues @xmath359 $ ] and @xmath360 $ ] both yield the same ellipsoid ( actually , a sphere of radius @xmath361 .",
    "the former can be translated in any direction with @xmath362 ; however , the latter can not be translated at all without losing complete positivity .",
    "it is tempting to think of a stochastic map @xmath8 as the composition of a rotation , contraction ( to an ellipsoid ) , translation , and another rotation .",
    "however , this is not accurate in the sense that the individual maps in this process will no longer be stochastic . in general",
    ", it is _ not _ possible to write a non - unital map as the composition of a unital map ( which contracts the bloch sphere to an ellipsoid ) and a translation .",
    "such a translation would have to be representable in the form @xmath363 which does not satisfy the conditions for complete positivity .        in a fixed basis ,",
    "the convex set of stochastic maps with @xmath364 forms a tetrahedron that we can describe using the @xmath58 in @xmath365 which we write as @xmath366 $ ] .",
    "the extreme points of the tetrahedron are @xmath367 , [ 1,-1,-1 ] , [ -1,1,-1 ] , [ -1,-1,1]$ ] .",
    "the edges connecting any two of these extreme points have the form @xmath368 $ ] up to permutation and correspond to quasi - extreme points of type ( iii ) .",
    "although this tetrahedron lies in a 3-dimensional space in a fixed basis , an arbitrary bistochastic map requires 9 parameters that could be chosen either as the 9 elements of the real @xmath46 matrix @xmath45 , or as the three @xmath58 and two sets of euler angles corresponding to the two rotations required to reduce @xmath8 to diagonal form . in a fixed basis ,",
    "an arbitrary bistochastic map can be written ( uniquely ) as a convex combination of 4 true extreme points , or non - uniquely as a convex combination of two quasi - extreme points on the `` edges '' .",
    "as the changes of basis rotate the tetrahedron ( considered as a set of diagonal @xmath369 matrices in @xmath370 ) , we obtain a much larger set so that ( by theorem [ thm:2maps ] ) any non - extreme map can be written as the midpoint of two `` generalized '' extreme points in different bases .",
    "we now describe the convex set analogous to the tetrahedron ( in a fixed basis ) for non - zero @xmath48 with @xmath48 fixed .",
    "we will consider the case when @xmath371 and @xmath372 is fixed and the @xmath58 vary .",
    "thus , we are in a 3-dimensional submanifold of @xmath373 .",
    "it follows from ( [ eq : ttrig ] ) that the extreme points are given by the curve @xmath374 $ ] subject to the constraint @xmath375 .",
    "this can be written in parametric form as a pair of curves [ ext.curve ] [ u , ( ^-1 ) , u ( ^-1 ) ] with @xmath376",
    ". this curve forms the boundary of figure 3 below . letting @xmath377",
    ", we see that the curve ( [ ext.curve ] ) passes through the four points @xmath378 $ ] , @xmath379 $ ] , @xmath380 $ ] , @xmath381 $ ] when @xmath382 .",
    "thus , as @xmath100 moves away from zero , the corners of the tetrahedron are replaced by these points as shown in figure 3 which might be described as an asymmetric rounded tetrahedron .",
    "we have shown the tetrahedron for comparison , placed in such a way that the edge connecting the vertices @xmath383 $ ] and @xmath367 $ ] is pointing towards us , and oriented the rounded tetrahedron similarly .",
    "the 4 points above split the curve into four pieces , corresponding to four of the six edges of the tetrahedron . in place of the remained two edges there appear two segments ( still on the surface of the  rounded \" tetrahedron ) connecting pairs of the four above points for which @xmath99 has the same sign . unlike the case @xmath106 these lines are not extreme points , even in a generalized sense .",
    "the inequalities ( [ eq : afcond ] ) imply that , as for the tetrahedron , the figure in ( 3b ) has rectangular cross sections for fixed @xmath99 with @xmath384 .",
    "when @xmath217 , the corners depend non - linearly on @xmath99 , yielding a curve of true extreme points .",
    "when @xmath106 , the linearity in @xmath99 yields a line segment so that we no longer have  true \" extreme points .",
    "the capacity of a quantum communication channel depends on the particular protocols allowed for transmission and measurement as well as the noise of the channel .",
    "see @xcite for definitions and discussion of some of these .",
    "we consider here only the so - called _ holevo capacity _ that corresponds to communication using product signals and entangled measurements and is now believed ( primarily on the basis of numerical evidence ) to be the maximum capacity associated with communication that does not involve prior entanglements .",
    "the holevo capacity is given by @xmath389 - \\sum_j \\pi_j   s [ \\phi(\\rho_j ) ] \\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath390 denotes the von neumann entropy of the density matrix @xmath391 , @xmath392 denotes a set of pure state density matrices , @xmath393 a discrete probability vector , and @xmath394 .",
    "it is easy to see that for extreme points of the type ( ii ) and ( iii ) , @xmath395 so that the capacity attains its maximal value , and for the completely noisy channel in ( ic ) , @xmath396 .",
    "by contrast , the non - unital situation ( i ) is more interesting because it includes channels for which the capacity ( [ holv.cap])is strictly bigger than the classical shannon capacity , i.e. , the capacity for communication restricted to product input and measurements .",
    "such channels demonstrate a definite quantum advantage .",
    "moreover , the capacity is , in general , achieved _ neither _ with a pair of orthogonal input states , which would yield @xmath397 , _ nor _ with a pair of minimal entropy states , which would yield @xmath398 where h(t ) = - - .",
    "this behavior was observed first by fuchs for a non - extreme channel @xcite ; subsequently , the amplitude - damping channel was studied by schumacher and westmoreland @xcite . in both cases",
    "the work was numerical , but suggests that this situation is generic for channels that are translated orthogonal to the major axis of the ellipse .    in the case ( ic ) when the ellipsoid shrinks to a line , the capacity can be computed explicitly as [ eq : capac.binary ] c _ ( ) & = & h ( = h(u ) + & > & 2 - h(u ) since @xmath399 .",
    "the expression @xmath400 is the capacity of the unshifted channel . in this case , it is also the classical shannon capacity .",
    "holevo @xcite introduced such channels and showed that they suffice to demonstrate the `` quantum advantage '' mentioned above , although the both the minimal entropy and capacity are achieved with orthogonal inputs .",
    "* remark : * holevo called channels of the form ( ic ) `` binary '' because their kraus operators can be represented in the form @xmath401 where the states @xmath402 are orthonormal and @xmath403 can , in principle , be any pair of states , such as corresponding to @xmath404 .",
    "when @xmath405 are the eigenvectors @xmath406 of @xmath407 , the resulting kraus operators are @xmath408 one can easily check that this yields a map of type ( ic ) with @xmath409 but the kraus operators do not have the form ( [ eq : kraus.trig ] ) .",
