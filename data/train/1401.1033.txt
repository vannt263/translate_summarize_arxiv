    "<S> this model looks very similar to the famous quantum dimer model introduced by rokhsar and kivelson on the square lattice @xcite and later studied on the honeycomb lattice @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the only difference between both models comes from the potential term that , in the rokhsar - kivelson model , is proportional to the number of flippable plaquettes . to our knowledge </S>",
