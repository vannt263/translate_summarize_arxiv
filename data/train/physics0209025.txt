    "weakly bound three - body zero - angular momentum states appear in a three boson system , with the number of states growing to infinity , condensing at zero energy as the pair interactions are just about to bind two particles in @xmath0wave .",
    "these three - body states are known as efimov states  @xcite .",
    "their wave functions , loosely bound , extend far beyond those of normal states and dominate the low - energy scattering phenomena in these systems .",
    "the efimov states have been studied in a number of model calculations  @xcite , in atomic and nuclear systems , without yet a clear experimental signature of their occurrence  @xcite .",
    "actually , the search of efimov states in atomic systems is becoming more appealing , due to the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensation ( bec )  @xcite , and due to the possibility of altering the effective scattering length of the low - energy atom - atom interaction in the trap , from large negative to large positive values crossing the dimer zero binding energy value , by using an external magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "this possibility of changing the two - body scattering length to large values , as recently shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , can alter in an essential way the balance between the non - linear first few terms of the mean - field description presented in the equations that model bose - einstein condensed gases  @xcite .",
    "this can certainly open new perspectives for theoretical and experimental investigations related to the many - body behavior of condensate systems . even in systems",
    "where the occurrence of an excited bound efimov state has shown to be doubtful or even not possible , as for example , in the case of halo nuclei like @xmath1c or @xmath2c ( seen as a core with a halo of two neutrons )  @xcite , one can verify the occurrence of three - body virtual states .",
    "the physics of these three - body systems is related to the unusually large size of the wave - function compared to the range of the potential .",
    "thus , the detailed form of the short - ranged potential is not important for the three - body observables@xcite , which gives to the system universal properties , defined by few physical scales@xcite . strictly speaking , in the limit of a zero - range interaction",
    "the three - body system is parametrized by the physical two- and three - body scales , which are identified with the two - body scattering lengths and one three - body binding energy  @xcite .",
    "the physical reason for the sensibility of the three - body binding energy to the interaction properties comes from the collapse of the system in the limit of a zero - range force , which is known as the thomas effect  @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we analyze the possibility that an excited trimer state becomes a virtual state , when the physical scales of the system are changed .",
    "this is expected to occur , for example , near the limit when the two - body scattering length goes from large positive to large negative value : the corresponding two - body energy is close to zero and goes from a bound to a virtual state , with appearance of many bound and virtual three - body states .",
    "the three - body virtual state energy is a pole of the s - matrix in the second sheet of the complex energy plane . in a general case , as the strength of the two - body potential diminishes , the pole moves towards the first energy sheet to become a bound state  @xcite .",
    "more recently , this behavior of the efimov state going to a virtual state with the increase of the strength of the interaction , has been confirmed in realistic calculation of the helium trimer  @xcite .",
    "here , we study a new physical aspect of the emergence of the @xmath0wave virtual state from an efimov state : _ it appears when the ratio between the dimer and trimer binding energies grows . _",
    "this approach goes beyond a previous analysis of excited three - body bound states with short - range interactions , that was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a scaling function was introduced to analyze the behavior of bound efimov states when modifying the triatomic physical scales .",
    "essentially , we are extending to the second sheet of the complex energy plane ( to include virtual trimer states ) a previous investigation on a universal scaling mechanism that was applied to two and three - body bound states@xcite .",
    "the extension of the scaling function to the second energy sheet is performed by following the efimov states as they move from bound to virtual , accordingly to the variation of the ratio of the dimer to trimer bound state energies . on the other hand ,",
    "as we present the discussion through a universal scaling mechanism with the results in dimensionless units , all the conclusions apply equally to any low - energy three - boson system . for the regularization and renormalization of the zero - range model ,",
    "we compare two different approaches : by using a momentum cutoff parameter  @xcite and via kernel subtraction  @xcite .",
    "as the two - body energy goes to zero ( or equivalently the regularization parameter goes to infinity ) , we conclude that the results of both methods do not differ .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we generalize the scaling function defined in ref .",
    "@xcite to include virtual trimer states . in this section",
    ", we also revise the connection between the thomas and efimov effects , while introducing our notation and the homogeneous integral equation for the faddeev component of the vertex of the wave - function for zero - range potential . in section",
    "iii we present our main numerical results . in the first subsection , we present the subtracted homogeneous faddeev equation that we have used for determining the trimer bound and virtual states and we briefly explain how the renormalization method of refs .",

    "@xcite . in the next subsection",
    ", we present our new numerical results for the virtual state energies , including the bound - state previous results and we compare , as well , the results obtained by using the sharp - cutoff and the subtraction scheme . comparison with other calculations are also discussed .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section iv .",
    "in this section , we introduce the generalization of the scaling function defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , to be used in the second energy sheet of the trimer energy . in order to become clear this extension , and to define our notation , we begin by revising the main findings of refs .  @xcite .",
    "the two - boson system in the limit of a zero - range interaction has only one physical scale , that one can choose the scattering length ( @xmath3 ) or the energy of the bound or virtual state .",
    "the two - body @xmath0wave scattering amplitude in units of @xmath4 is parametrized as a function of the momentum @xmath5 , by @xmath6 where the @xmath0wave phase shift @xmath7 is given by @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the effective range . for @xmath10",
    "the two - body system is bound , otherwise , for @xmath11 , it is virtual .",

    "the three - boson system for @xmath17 in three dimensions collapses when @xmath18 with a fixed two - body scale , which is known as thomas effect@xcite .",

    "space dimensions the collapse is absent@xcite . in the limit when the binding energy of the two - boson system goes to zero , the three - boson system has an infinite number of bound efimov states  @xcite condensing at zero - energy .",
    "the thomas and efimov effects were shown to be physically equivalent  @xcite , since in both cases the ratio between the interaction range and the two - body scattering length goes to zero .    the integral equation for the faddeev components , @xmath19 , of the three boson bound state vertex , for @xmath17 , with the zero - range interaction",

    "they are the energies of the efimov states , in units of @xmath22 .",
    "but , the limit of @xmath30 going to zero , can be realized either by @xmath34 ( with a fixed @xmath35 ) or by @xmath36 ( with @xmath37 fixed ) . in this last case ,",
    "the range of the interaction is set to zero and the system collapses : @xmath38 .",
    "this is known as the thomas collapse of the three - body ground state .",

    "@xcite , @xmath47 was identified with the three - body scale , as any state @xmath48 works equally well to set the trimer scale .",
    "however , we will be interested in the two most excited three - body states , that in practice we are going to identify with the ground and first excited state in triatomic systems .",
    "this identification is unambiguous because , with @xmath48 and @xmath49 two consecutive excited states , the limit @xmath50 exists and defines the scaling function @xmath51@xcite .",

    "@xcite based on the notion of the long - range potential @xcite .    in the next , we provide the generalization of the scaling function ( [ lim ] ) , that is obtained by extending the formalism to the second sheet of the three - body complex energy plane . in the present approach ,",
    "we only consider the two - body subsystem as bound .",

    "relative to the bound subsystem , we can define bound and virtual states for the three - body system : @xmath52 assumes a negative value for a three - body virtual state ; and a positive value for a three - body bound - state .",

    "this figure also strongly suggests that the thomas - efimov states can not be completely understood only through the absolute value of @xmath37 itself , because the critical value for the appearance of the @xmath120-excited state depends only on the ratio @xmath121 , which is independent of the absolute scale .",

    "the dependence of the @xmath0wave virtual state three - body energy on the two and three atom ground state binding energies is calculated in the limit of a zero - range potential in a form of an universal scaling function .",
    "the scaling plots are an useful tool to classify observables and provide first guess to guide realistic calculations , as well as for planning experiments , with the aim of looking for weakly bound excited state of triatomic molecules .",
