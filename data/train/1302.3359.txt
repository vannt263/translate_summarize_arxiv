    "recently it was shown that there should also exist protected gapless interface states , based on symmetry arguments , at the junction between two tis with opposite helicity direction @xcite .",
    "these interface states are not protected in the same manner as the surface states of a single ti , instead they are protected by mirror symmetry .",
    "the physics of this system resembles certain aspects of bilayer graphene , because both result from the hybridization of dirac cones .    in this paper",

    "the helicity direction of the spin texture depends on the relative sign of the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 , i.e.  @xmath18 ( ref .  ) .",

    "we find no solutions for the other case in which both tis have equal helicity , i.e.  if both parameters have the same sign . to simplify the calculation and because the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) has full rotation symmetry about the @xmath22-axis",

    "this corresponds with tis that have surface states with opposite helicity direction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : junction ] ) , and the magnitude of @xmath50 determines the fermi velocity of the surface states . in fig .",
    "[ fig : plot1](a ) the dispersion of the interface states is shown for three different values of @xmath43 .",
    "the interface states have linear dispersion ( in the radial direction ) around @xmath51 which results from the hybridization of the dirac cones from the separated tis , similar to aa stacked bilayer graphene @xcite .",
    "the cones intersect closer to the center if their fermi velocity is smaller . from the energy scale in fig .  [",

    "again this corresponds with tis that have surface states with opposite helicity direction ( fig.[fig : junction ] ) , and the magnitude of @xmath50 determines the fermi velocity of the surface states . in fig .",
    "[ fig : plot2 ] the dispersion of the interface states is shown for @xmath58 and @xmath55 .",
    "unlike case 1 , there is little interaction between the surfaces , and the cones lie on top of each other .",
    "the density is also shown for two states in fig .",
    "[ fig : plot2 ] , one on each cone .",
    "we see that the states on each cone are not localized at the junction , but instead they are localized inside one of the tis , as we would expect if there is little interaction , and the individual surface states keep most of their original character .",
    "ti2 has the largest fermi velocity , correspondingly the states on the steepest cone are localized in ti2 .",
    "the fermi velocity of the cones in the interface spectrum is two times as large as the original cone of the separated ti for ti1 and about 0.8 times smaller for ti2 , and thus the cones are attracted to each other .",
    "finally we consider the case where @xmath56 and @xmath49 .",
    "unlike the previous two cases , this corresponds with tis that have surface states with equal helicity direction .",
    "the dispersion of the interface states is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : plot3 ] for @xmath58 and @xmath47 .",
    "we see that we get a combination of the previous two cases , a linear spectrum near the center and a crossing away from the center .",
    "the density is also shown for two states in fig .",
    "[ fig : plot3 ] , localized on ti1 , one near the center and one near the crossing point .",
    "we see that near the center , we have the same behavior as in case 2 , and closer to the crossing point the interaction between the surfaces is stronger as indicated by the shift of the density towards the junction .",
    "the states on the steep cone do not differ much from those of the steep cone of fig .",
    "[ fig : plot2 ] and are localized within ti2 .     and @xmath47 .",
    "the density ( arb .",
    "units ) is shown on the right for the two states that are marked with a cross on the dispersion.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]       and @xmath17 .",
    "when either of the parameters changes sign , the gap closes at @xmath59 shown and the helicity changes orientation .",
    "crossing from region 0 to region 1 - 3 corresponds with case 1 - 3.,scaledwidth=25.0% ]    if the helicity direction of the tis is opposite , the existence of the gapless interface states can be understood from scattering of surface states at the junction between the two tis , as shown in refs .   and .",
    "at normal incidence , the incoming state on the surface of ti1 can not scatter backwards because of spin conservation .",
    "this is similar to graphene , where pseudospin conservation results in klein tunneling through potential barriers at normal incidence @xcite .",
    "however , when ti2 has opposite helicity , the incoming state can not go forward because there are no states in ti2 that conserve both spin and momentum .",
    "this paradox is solved by the existence of gapless interface states between the tis . at normal incidence",
    "the incoming state has to go into the interface .",
    "consequently , these states should exist for @xmath60 or @xmath61 .",
    "the origin of the surface states in tis can be understood from the closure of the bulk band gap if the hamiltonian is transformed continuously from a trivial insulator to a ti . in the same way",
    ", we can understand the interface states at the junction between two tis .",
    "we observe that the gap of the bulk band structure of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) closes at @xmath51 if the parameter @xmath16 changes sign , and it closes at @xmath53 if the parameter @xmath17 changes sign , which could be an indication of a topological phase transition .",
    "the origin of the interface states within the model can then also be understood from this closing of the bulk gap when @xmath62 at @xmath51 for case 1 , and when @xmath63 at @xmath53 for case 2 . when both parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 change sign as in case 3 , we end up with two tis with equal helicity direction .",
    "therefore , at first sight it might be surprising that interface states appear .",
    "however , from the previous discussion it is clear that the bulk gap closes at two different @xmath64 values when both @xmath16 and @xmath17 change sign , which explains why the resulting spectrum in case 3 ( fig .  [ fig : plot3 ] ) is a combination of the spectra of case 1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : plot1](a ) ) and case 2 ( fig .  [ fig : plot2 ] ) .",
    "this is illustrated with a schematic phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : diag ] , where we show the four different sign combinations of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and the @xmath59 points at which the gap closes when the helicity changes orientation .",
    "because of the invariance of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) under any rotation about the @xmath22-axis , we find gapless interface states along any @xmath65-direction .",
    "if we take into account terms up to order @xmath66 , the full rotation symmetry is relaxed to threefold @xmath67 rotation symmetry of the bi@xmath0se@xmath1 crystal @xcite , and we expect a gap to open in the interface spectrum along @xmath68 or @xmath69 directions , giving a total of six dirac cones over the entire brillouin zone .",
    "however , the solution method becomes unpractical in this case , because the equation for @xmath29 ( [ eq : lambda ] ) contains odd powers , and we need to find the roots of a depressed quartic equation .",
    "now raises the question if materials can exist for which the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 changes sign with respect to their bi@xmath0se@xmath1 values . in ref .",
    "it is argued that the sign of @xmath16 is determined by the sign of the atomic soc , while the sign of @xmath17 is independent of the atomic soc .",
    "however , the atomic soc parameter , given by the diagonal matrix element of @xmath70 , does not change sign for bi@xmath0se@xmath1-like tis because the potential is always attractive for atoms @xcite .",
    "therefore , the helicity direction is always the same within the bi@xmath0se@xmath1 family of tis .",
    "however , the model ( [ eq : ham ] ) is valid for a general ti , and therefore we believe that the interface between tis with opposite helicity is possible in principle , as was also mentioned in ref .  . furthermore , there are other mechanisms besides soc which can give rise to a band inversion . for example , strained bulk hgte is a 3d ti @xcite in which the band inversion is caused by other relativistic corrections @xcite .",
    "also in type - ii inas / gasb heterostructures , one can achieve a band inversion from confinement @xcite .       and",
    "@xmath71 ev , where we have included the tachyonlike solutions ; this corresponds to fig .",
    "3(a ) of ref .  .",
    "( [ eq : tachyon ] ) is plotted for ti1 ( red ) and ti2 ( green ) together with the numerical results ( dots ) . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tachyonk ] ) we find @xmath72 and @xmath73.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we found no signature of tachyons in this system as claimed in ref .  .",
    "the reason is the following .",
    "if the @xmath29 s used to construct the general solution ( [ eq : wf ] ) become four times degenerate , the solution is no longer valid because it contains the same contribution twice . in this case , the matrix of the homogeneous system , defined by the boundary conditions ( [ eq : boundary ] ) , is always singular and one seemingly finds solutions .",
    "the extra degeneracy occurs at @xmath42 points where the equation in @xmath74 has a repeated root ( eq .  (",
    "[ eq : lambda ] ) ) .",
    "this happens when the discriminant vanishes which allowed us to obtain an expression for the ` dispersion ' , @xmath75+\\left(c_2-\\frac{m_2}{m_1}c_1\\right)k^2 \\\\      & \\pm\\frac{1}{2m_1 ^ 2}\\sqrt{(c_1 ^ 2-m_1 ^ 2)f(k ) } ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath76 when the argument of the square root becomes negative , the ` group velocity ' diverges and @xmath77 becomes complex .",
    "this happens at @xmath78 , which gives the tachyonic point @xcite @xmath79 in fig .",
    "[ fig : tachyon ] we show the dispersion for the case which was also considered in ref .  , @xmath45 and @xmath71 ev .",
    "we see that eq .",
    "( [ eq : tachyon ] ) exactly fits the tachyonlike ` dispersions ' obtained with a numerical calculation that does not take the degeneracy into account . in this case",
    "we get two tachyonlike ` dispersions ' because the degeneracy occurs for @xmath80 and @xmath81 for this parameter set .",
    "we know that the degeneracy occurs on a real @xmath82 grid if @xmath83 is real .",
    "the same problem occurs if we consider a vacuum interface , because the degeneracy of @xmath29 is independent of the boundary conditions . in this case",
    ", one can analytically show that the tachyonic solutions are not physical .",
    "the correct general solution at the degeneracy is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : wf2 ] ) in the appendix .",
    "now we only find solutions at the points of intersection between the unphysical tachyonlike ` dispersion ' and physical solutions .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied interface states at the junction between two tis with equally and oppositely oriented helicity direction . the origin of the gapless interface states can be understood from the closing of the bulk gap in the transition from one orientation of helicity to the opposite orientation at different wavevectors .",
    "even if we relax the full rotation symmetry of the model , there should still be gapless states at @xmath60 or @xmath61 if we wish to avoid the scattering paradox of surface states at the junction between two tis with opposite helicity .",
    "this topological phase transition has been characterized by a topological invariant produced by the mirror symmetry of the system in ref .  .",
    "also , we found that the tachyonlike dispersion presented in ref .   does not correspond to physical solutions .",
    "rather , it is a consequence of implementing the wrong general solution at points on the @xmath82 grid where the secular equation ( [ eq : lambda ] ) has four repeated roots .",
    "this degeneracy occurs independent of boundary conditions and the same complication arises for a vacuum interface where one can analytically show that these solutions are unphysical . from the comparison of eq .",
    "[ eq : tachyon ] with the numerical results in fig .",
    "[ fig : tachyon ] , and the fact that the tachyonic solutions vanish if we use the correct general solution at the degeneracy , we conclude that this system does not show any signature of tachyons .",
    "the authors would like to thank dr .",
    "o.  leenaerts for the helpful discussions .",
    "this work was supported by the research foundation flanders ( fwo ) .",
    "after the substitution @xmath84 , the schrdinger equation @xmath85 is given by a coupled system of homogeneous second order differential equations that is solved with the ansatz @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is an eigenvector of the hamiltonian .",
    "this yields a system of algebraic equations which have a nonzero solution if @xmath28 which we can write as the square of a biquadratic equation in @xmath29 , given by @xmath86 with @xmath87 this gives four doubly degenerate @xmath30 in general , and the eigenspace of @xmath88 is spanned by two eigenvectors @xmath89 which can be chosen as @xcite @xmath90 the general solution is then given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : wf ] ) . however , if the @xmath29 are further degenerate , i.e. when eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda ] ) has a repeated root , there are only two distinct @xmath29 that are both four times degenerate . in the last case",
    ", there are only two linear independent solutions for each @xmath29 , given by @xmath91 and @xmath92 . in order to find two more linear independent solutions ,",
    "we first consider a general system of @xmath93 homogeneous second order ordinary differential equations : @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are constant @xmath97 matrices .",
