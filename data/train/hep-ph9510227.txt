    "rare decays of heavy mesons received considerable interest in the recent years as possible grounds for testing the standard model in flavor changing neutral current processes which known to occur only at one loop level @xcite .",
    "exclusive decays of @xmath9-mesons to the non - charmed final states ( which are examples of fcnc ) are somewhat easier to observe experimentally",
    ". however theoretical calculations of exclusive rates include modeling of the hadronization of the final @xmath10-quark and the resulting predictions vary by the order of magnitude from one to another .",
    "the inclusive radiative decay @xmath11 was recently observed by cleo collaboration @xcite and is consistent with the @xmath12 expectations .",
    "it is now generally accepted that @xmath1 corrections significantly change the decay rate for this process so it is important to bring all of the possible corrections under control to reduce theoretical uncertainties associated with @xmath1 .",
    "most work on the inclusive @xmath0 decay proceeds by calculating radiative corrections to the quark decay @xmath4(see for example @xcite ) . however , there are also several diagrams where a radiative correction involves a gluon which interacts with the spectator quark .",
    "they generate effects which are not accounted for in spectator model calculations , and the inclusive rate @xmath11 could in principle differ from that of @xmath4 at order @xmath2 .",
    "if one is interested in a complete analysis of this decay mode , these non - spectator diagrams must be included .",
    "this is especially true if one is interested in the photon spectrum , since reactions which include the spectator quark produce a softer photon spectrum than does the free quark decay .",
    "the calculation presented below fills this gap and completes the calculation of the process of inclusive radiative decay of heavy meson at the level @xmath13    in this paper , we present a @xmath1 based calculation which estimates these non - spectator effects .",
    "there are 12 diagrams which we consider , shown in fig 1 .",
    "the weak vertices are calculated in @xmath1 perturbation theory ( some vertices already exist in the literature ) , and the accmm model @xcite is used to calculate the decay rates and spectra .",
    "the interference of these diagrams with the leading @xmath4 amplitude only occurs for small values of the momentum of the spectator quark .",
    "this portion is then particularly sensitive to the bound - state wavefunction , but fortunately the interference is relatively small .",
    "the main non - spectator effect comes from the region of phase space where the spectator quark recoils significantly , and hence are second order in @xmath2 .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we organize the calculation and recall some of the information which in known about the gluonic vertices .",
    "section 3 is devoted to most of the details about the calculation of the modifications to the decay rate and photon spectrum .",
    "the impact of the results is described in section 4 . before proceeding ,",
    "let us resolve a nomenclature ambiguity .",
    "it is conventional to call calculations which focus on the @xmath4 transition by the phrase `` spectator model '' and to refer to the light quark in the b hadron as the `` spectator '' quark .",
    "we will continue to use the latter phrase for the light quark in the b meson although , in the diagrams which we consider , it is no longer a spectator but is an active participant in the weak decay .",
    "we will call the @xmath14 diagrams the spectator process and conversely will label those which actively involve the spectator quark as non - spectator transitions .",
    "there are quite a number of diagrams at order @xmath2 which lead to modifications to @xmath11 , as shown in fig 1 .",
    "let us divide these into five classes :    \\1 .",
    "@xmath1-corrections to the single quark process @xmath4 .",
    "`` gluonic - penguin '' ( bremstrahlung ) diagrams which include @xmath15-vertex with photons emitted from external quark legs .    \\3 .",
    "`` triangle '' diagrams in which both the gluon and photon are emitted from weak vertex due to a quark loop .",
    "hard gluon spectator exchange diagrams with gluons emitted from @xmath16 or @xmath17-lines .",
    "diagram ( @xmath18 ) involves the @xmath19-vertex and and is suppressed by a power of @xmath20 .",
    "we will not consider this diagram further .",
    "the calculation proceeds by evaluating each of the diagrams , adding them together coherently , integrating over the initial particles momentum using a momentum space wavefunction and summing over the final momenta and spins .",
    "the effective vertices are often momentum dependent and depend on the momentum flow in the diagram .",
    "since we are dealing with inclusive decays , the details of hadronization of the final @xmath17-quark state are not relevant for our discussion ( all hadronic final states are summed over ) , so we have to model only the initial state .",
    "this substantially reduces the model - dependence of the final result .",
    "however we do have to carefully account for interference effects between the many diagrams , as different diagrams contribute to different portions of the final particles phase space . for the @xmath4 process",
    ", the spectator quark emerges with only low momentum reflecting its momentum in the bound state wavefunction .",
    "however in the other diagrams , the final quarks carry a typical momentum of a fraction of the b mass .",
    "interference between the two classes only occurs in a portion of the available phase space .",
    "we address this region specifically below . for the initial state wavefunction we use the accmm model .",
    "in this calculation we shall encounter two types of vertices : `` penguin '' and `` triangle '' .",
    "1.penguin  vertex ( fig.2a ) .",
    "this vertex was calculated quite a while ago @xcite and for the @xmath15-interactions turned out to be [ penguin ] _ ^a=- v_bt v_ts ( f_1^g ( x ) ( k^2 _ - k_/k ) ( 1 + _ 5 ) - m_b f_2^g ( x ) i _",
    "k^(1-_5 ) ) where @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 are the inami - lim functions , @xmath24 , using unitarity of ckm matrix we get @xmath25 and @xmath26 for @xmath27,@xmath28 .",
    "only the magnetic - moment type vertex contributes to the real photon emission in the @xmath4 , so [ onshell ] _ = v_biv_is m_b f_2^ ( x ) i _",
    "q^(1-_5 ) @xmath29 .",
    "we refer to @xmath30 being the momentum of the gluon and @xmath31 - momentum of the photon . in the gluon vertex",
    ", we shall drop the small contribution from @xmath32 , which , however , might be sizable for gluonic penguin - mediated hadronic processes @xcite .    \\2 .",
    "`` triangle '' vertex ( fig.2b ) .",
    "the calculation of this vertex reduces to the calculation of the set of usual triangle diagrams with certain form - factors ( a complete parameterization of the diagrams of this type was first given in @xcite ) and is interesting in the sense that light ( spectator quark ) current couples to @xmath33 current through @xmath34-tensors .",
    "the vertex itself was recently calculated by d.wyler and h.simma in @xcite and takes the form [ triangle ] _",
    "^a=- v_bi v_is ( i f_1  s + i f_2  s + i f_3  s ) ^s ( 1 + _ 5 ) where @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37,@xmath38 , @xmath17 is a total momentum of internal quarks .",
    "these vertices will be used to calculate the rate and spectrum in the next section .",
    "we define the total decay rate as _",
    "tot=_q+_sc+_mix where @xmath39 represents the leading contributions from @xmath4 ( diagrams of the class @xmath40 ) , @xmath41 gives the corrections which involve the spectator quarks , and @xmath42 gives the mixing of the two . in powers of the strong coupling constant , @xmath42 is of order @xmath2 and @xmath41 is of order @xmath43 .",
    "in order to account for bound state effects , we will treat the decay of a @xmath9-meson as a @xmath44 scattering process , assuming that the scattering occurs from the bound state and model this state with the accmm - model @xcite . in calculating the decay rate ( cross section @xmath44 )",
    "we average over the spins of the initial particles which , in principle , leads to the prediction for @xmath45 for the `` mixture '' of @xmath9 and @xmath46-particles ( one can , at the expense of a considerable increase in complexity of the calculation , separate @xmath9 and @xmath46 by introducing polarization operators for projecting out different spin combinations ) .",
    "thus the decay rate is defined as [ rate ] d=   |t_fi|^2   d where factor of @xmath47 in the denominator comes from the spin averaging and [ phase ] d=(2)^4 ^ 4(p_f - p_i ) we also treat spectator quark as massless to simplify the following calculations .",
    "the final phase space integration is performed numerically .",
    "the introduction of interactions with the light quark obviously makes the kinematics of the process more involved - the final state is no longer a simple two - body final state which results in delta - function - like peak in the photon energy distribution . instead",
    ", the peak is now extended down to lower photon energies making it possible for the photon to populate the energy interval from @xmath48 to @xmath49 . moreover , a difference between the decay spectra of neutral and charged mesons also arises .",
    "the question that naturally appears here is whether it is possible to have an interference of the spectator and non - spectator mechanisms .",
    "since the @xmath4 transition is of order @xmath50 and the non - spectator matrix elements are first order in @xmath2 this would provide corrections of order @xmath2 . if there were not any momentum associated with the bound state , the spectator quark would remain precisely at rest in the @xmath4 transition and therefore would not interfere with the diagrams where momentum was transferred to the spectator quark .",
    "however if bound state effects are present the spectator quark will always carry some momentum ( typically of order 1 gev or less ) and the two classes of diagrams can interfere . since this occurs only over one portion of the phase space , we can say that the interference effects are really of order @xmath51 .    in the bound state ,",
    "the initial momenta are described by a momentum distribution @xmath52 ( which is given by the wave function of quarks inside of the meson).the interference takes place with a probability proportional to a wave - function overlap .",
    "we now turn to the calculation of this overlap .",
    "let @xmath53 to be an operator responsible for the transitions via mechanism @xmath40 and @xmath54 - via mechanisms @xmath55 .",
    "then , the mixing term arises as a result of @xmath56 where we have used completeness relation for @xmath57-states .",
    "we are interested in the last term .",
    "let us write down the contributions from different classes of diagrams in turn .",
    "@xmath58    here @xmath34 is the polarization vector of the photon @xmath59 are the charges of b - quark and spectator respectively , and @xmath60 is given by ( [ penguin ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath61 in the denominator due to gluon propagator is to be cancelled by @xmath61 in @xmath15-vertex , so @xmath62 is a local operator .",
    "this operator ( convoluted with the lowest order non - spectator graph , along with its charge conjugate part ) gives a contribution to the shape of the photon spectrum .",
    "the result of convolution can be represented as    @xmath63    with @xmath64 , @xmath65 and analogously for @xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 is a color factor coming from the averaging over initial colors and summing over the final ones ( taking into account the fact that initial and final states are color - singlets ) .",
    "also @xmath71 the calculation of the contribution from the diagrams of the class @xmath72 is more involved mainly because of the complicated structure of the vertex ( [ triangle ] ) .",
    "the amplitude squared reads    t_iii^2= h_^ l^w_= -h^_l^with @xmath73 we will be working explicitly with components of this current in order to get @xmath74 . using various @xmath75-matrix identities @xmath76 , \\nonumber",
    "\\\\ \\gamma_\\alpha \\gamma_\\nu \\gamma_\\theta = g_{\\alpha \\nu } \\gamma_\\theta + g_{\\nu \\theta } \\gamma_\\alpha - g_{\\alpha \\theta } \\gamma_\\nu - i \\epsilon_{\\alpha",

    "next , using explicit form of @xmath78 , identities ^ _ 5 = - ^ _ to get rid of @xmath34-couplings and discarding terms proportional to @xmath79 ( on - shell photons ) , we write @xmath80    using ( [ de ] ) we obtain the contributions from class @xmath72 . finally , class @xmath81 gives the following    @xmath82    let us also mention that some range of momentum transferred to the spectator gives a contribution to the decay rate which is highly suppressed - in the accmm - model , for instance , decay rate looks like = d^3p ^*_b(p ) _ qm _",
    "b(p ) with @xmath83 and @xmath84 . note that this expression reduces to the conventional accmm - averaging if the momentum flow between heavy quark and spectator lines is discarded .",
    "it is clear that if the magnitude of @xmath85-momentum transferred to the spectator line is large , the factor of wave function suppression is large as well which results in the exponential fall - off of the @xmath2-spectrum as @xmath86 .",
    "this is the reason why non - spectator @xmath2 corrections turn out to give much smaller impact on the line shape of the spectrum than those at order @xmath43 , in fact , 1.0 10 ^ -2      let us now consider corrections of order @xmath43 .",
    "in fact they can simply be obtained by squaring the sum of @xmath87 presented in the previous section .",
    "we shall present only few of them emphasizing their possible experimental signatures and highlighting some steps of derivations .",
    "* class i*. diagrams of class @xmath40 give contributions to @xmath39 and have been calculated elsewhere @xcite .",
    "this contribution to the branching ratio @xmath88 varies from @xmath89 to @xmath90 .",
    "the major uncertainties at present come from the choice of the renormalization scale in the effective operators and the km elements , and so this branching ratio can be predicted more accurately in the future as the km elements are more precisely measured .    *",
    "class ii*. diagrams of this class give a new contribution to @xmath45 which comes from the emission of the photon from the spectator quark .",
    "the matrix elements for diagrams ( @xmath91 ) and ( @xmath92 ) ( fig .",
    "1 ) can be rewritten as t_fi= h_l_^^and are given by ( [ t2 ] ) .",
    "taking the hermitian conjugate and multiplying by ( [ t2 ] ) gives @xmath93 for which we can write [ master ] |t_fi|^2= h _",
    "w^ where @xmath94 where as before we set @xmath95 and @xmath96 is a color factor . to obtain @xmath96",
    "we have used the fact that @xmath9-meson is a superposition of the color - singlet states , so c^2_= tr ( ) = evaluating the traces we obtain for @xmath97 : @xmath98 where the last term vanishes upon contraction with @xmath99 for which we can write down ( taking into account contraction with @xmath100 ) : @xmath101 for the diagrams ( @xmath91 ) and ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "these diagrams might be interesting from the experimental point of view since they give rise to different contributions from charged and neutral @xmath9-mesons ( the amplitude is proportional to the charge of spectator @xmath102 ) , so one , in principle , can observe this charge asymmetry a= ~0.3 10 ^ -3 however the small size of our prediction means that it will be difficult to make this measurement .",
    "* class iii*. calculation of the diagrams of this class involves the effective vertex ( [ triangle ] ) for the sum of two diagrams - 8 and 9 .",
    "as before , the amplitude squared can be written in the form @xmath103 expanding @xmath104 as @xmath105 we get @xmath106 thus , the problem is the calculation of @xmath107 .",
    "this calculation , which requires the explicit form for the @xmath108-functions and involves expansions of the products of @xmath34-tensors , results in a quite lengthy final expression .",
    "however , restricting our attention only to the case of real photons ( @xmath109 ) and taking advantage of the symmetry of @xmath110 under @xmath111 ( implying further convolution with `` light '' tensor @xmath110 ) simplify the result enormously since there are only four combinations of @xmath108 s that give non - vanishing contributions to the problem of interest .",
    "they are @xmath112 combining all of the terms together and contracting @xmath113 to @xmath110 one obtains the contribution of the class iii diagrams to the @xmath45 which is to be computed numerically . the resulting analytical expression for",

    "@xmath129 given the recent measured by @xmath130 value for @xmath131 @xcite we conclude that spectator corrections give an overall effect of about @xmath7 on the inclusive decay rate @xmath132 .",
    "the diagrams which involve the spectator quark are in general non - local and involve momentum transfers to the spectator which are comparable to the energy released in the decay .",
    "this is a quite different configuration from the @xmath4 transition where the spectator quark is nearly at rest . despite the inclusion of the bound state momentum of the spectator ,",
    "the interference of the two classes of diagrams turns out to be very small .",
    "we have evaluated the remaining effects of the spectator diagrams , which then amount to effects at order @xmath43 .        * * since we are calculating @xmath1-corrections associated with bound - state effects it is convenient to work in the rest frame of @xmath9-meson .",
