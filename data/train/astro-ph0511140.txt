    "the _ stella nova _ of 1572 is the only historical supernova ( sn ) that can be classified with some degree of confidence as type ia based on its observed light curve and color evolution @xcite .",
    "our knowledge of the universe has improved greatly since this momentous event was recorded by tycho brahe and other astronomers in the sixteenth century , but now , as then , there are many unanswered questions regarding the nature of supernovae .",
    "type ia sne play a key role as cosmological probes @xcite , and they constitute the most direct evidence for the accelerating universe @xcite , but despite the continuing efforts of theorists during the last decades , our understanding of these objects is far from being complete .",
    "there is a general agreement that type ia sne are the result of the thermonuclear explosion of a c+o white dwarf ( wd ) that is destabilized by accretion from a companion star in a close binary system .",
    "this so - called ` single degenerate ' scenario has been recently substantiated by the discovery of a g - type star near the center of the tycho supernova remnant ( snr ) that appears to be the surviving companion to the wd that exploded as a sn in 1572 @xcite , and by the presence of a weak h@xmath1 signature in the late time spectrum of the unusual type ia sn 2002ic @xcite .",
    "however , the fundamental details of the explosion itself are still obscure , and a number of contending models or paradigms are currently being considered .",
    "most of these paradigms assume that the wd becomes unstable and then explodes when its mass approaches the chandrasekhar limit ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "in this case , the properties of the explosion are determined mainly by the propagation mode of the burning front through the star , which can be supersonic ( detonations ) , subsonic ( deflagrations ) , or a combination of both ( delayed detonations , pulsating delayed detonations ) . in the prompt detonation models , the burning front propagates supersonically through the star , incinerating almost its entire mass to fe - peak nuclei . in pure deflagration models , the burning front propagates",
    "subsonically and the star has the time to expand ahead of the flame . when the expansion velocity of the unburnt material becomes comparable to that of the burning front , the flame quenches , leaving a mixture of unburnt fuel ( c and o ) and ashes ( fe - peak nuclei ) in the ejecta , usually with trace amounts of intermediate mass elements ( imes : si , s , ar , ca , etc . ) . in one - dimensional deflagration models ,",
    "the ejecta are layered , with the ashes interior to the fuel , but three - dimensional calculations have shown that the turbulent properties of the burning front lead to an efficient mixture of fuel and ashes through the ejecta . in the delayed detonation models ,",
    "the burning front begins as a deflagration and then it is artificially forced to make the transition to a detonation , usually when a prescribed transition density @xmath3 is reached . in this kind of explosions ,",
    "most of the wd is burnt and very little c and o is left behind , but the expansion of the star during the initial deflagration allows for the detonation to burn a sizable mass of ejecta at intermediate densities , leading to a significant production of imes .",
    "pulsating delayed detonations are a variation of this scenario , where the flame quenches after a brief deflagration phase and the wd re - collapses , triggering a detonation in the process .",
    "the ejecta are stratified in all the flavors of delayed detonations simulated in one dimension , with fe - peak nuclei interior to imes , and some unburnt c and o in the outermost layers .",
    "whether this is also the case for three - dimensional delayed detonations is still under debate . given the appropriate circumstances , it is also possible for the wd to explode with a sub - chandrasekhar mass , leading to an entirely different class of models whose initial conditions are not so well determined .",
    "sub - chandrasekhar explosions usually involve the ignition under degenerate conditions of a layer of accreted he on top of the c+o wd , which sends a strong pressure wave towards the center of the star that eventually triggers a detonation .",
    "the structure of the ejecta is complex , with unburnt c and o and imes sandwiched between two regions rich in fe - peak nuclei . for more details on these explosion paradigms and a complete set of references , see the reviews by @xcite ( mostly one - dimensional models ) , @xcite ( three - dimensional deflagrations ) , and the recent works by @xcite and @xcite ( three - dimensional delayed detonations ) .",
    "there have been numerous attempts to constrain these theoretical models , mostly through the optical / ir spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and light curves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of type ia sne , and also through the few available gamma - ray observations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "although some preference has been shown for delayed detonation models in these studies , it can not be said that a general consensus has been reached in this matter , and the physical mechanism responsible for type ia sn explosions still remains an open issue . in the present paper , we address the problem of constraining the physics of type ia sn explosions from a different perspective . instead of focusing on the emission from the sne themselves , we take advantage of the excellent quality of the existing x - ray observations of snrs provided by _",
    "xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ to probe the physical mechanism responsible for the explosions .",
    "the necessary theoretical groundwork was laid down in @xcite and @xcite ( henceforth , paper i and paper ii ) , where we showed that the structure of the sn ejecta has a profound impact on the thermal x - ray emission from type ia snrs . as a consequence ,",
    "the x - ray spectra have the potential to pose strong constraints on the kind of explosion that originated the snr . here",
    "we apply the models developed in papers i and ii to the x - ray spectrum of the tycho snr .",
    "we begin by summarizing the observations of this object in   [ sec : observations ] . based on the observational properties of tycho",
    ", we outline our strategy for comparing our models to the observations in   [ sec : goals - and - strategy ] . in   [ sec : line - emission ] , we extract spatially integrated spectra from large regions of an _ xmm - newton _ observation of tycho and derive the fundamental properties of the line emission from the shocked sn ejecta .",
    "we compare our models with these observations in two stages : first we select the most promising models based on the properties of their line emission in   [ sec : line - emission - models ] and then we compare the best candidates to the spatially integrated spectrum in   [ sec : modeling - integrated_spectrum ] . in   [ sec : spatial ] we consider the spatial distribution of the line emission from a _ chandra _",
    "acis - i observation , and examine the implications for our models .",
    "finally , we discuss the performance of the models from a global point of view in   [ sec : discussion ] , and we summarize our conclusions in   [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "as early as 1945 , @xcite used the observations made and compiled by tycho brahe to derive a light curve that enabled him to identify the _ stella nova _ of 1572 as a type i supernova @xcite . since then , the classification of the supernova as determined from its light curve has been controversial , and some authors have claimed that sn 1572 was a subluminous event ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite performed a detailed reanalysis of the sixteenth century records and evaluated the uncertainties in the data in order to describe the light curve in the terms used nowadays to characterize type ia sne . according to @xcite ,",
    "sn 1572 was a normal type ia sn within the uncertainties associated with the data ( which are large ) , with a peak visual magnitude of @xmath4 mag , and a stretch factor is a parameterization of the light curve width / shape relationship , defined as the linear broadening or narrowing of the rest - frame time scale of an average template light curve that is required to match the observed light curve .",
    "values of @xmath5 close to 1 denote ` normal ' type ia sne .",
    "see @xcite for more details . ]",
    "the author found an extinction of @xmath7 mag and an average reddening of @xmath8 in that direction of the sky , which combined with the value of @xmath9 yield an estimate of @xmath10 kpc for the distance to the sn , assuming @xmath11 .      in the radio continuum observations at 1375 mhz ( @xmath12 cm )",
    ", the tycho snr appears as a clearly defined shell with an approximate angular diameter of 8. the shell is nearly spherical from the northwest to the southeast , with an irregular outbreak accompanied by a slight brightening to the north , northeast and east .",
    "@xcite , used vla observations to estimate the expansion parameter of the forward shock , @xmath13 ( defined as @xmath14 ) , along the rim of the snr shell .",
    "they found an average of @xmath15 , with distinctly lower values towards the north and east .",
    "it was found later that the lower value of @xmath13 in the northeast is due to an interaction with a dense cloud of neutral hydrogen @xcite .",
    "there is a puzzling , and still unsolved , disagreement between these radio measurements and the value of @xmath16 inferred from x - ray observations by @xcite .",
    "the expansion parameters of several interior features , measured using the same techniques , are consistent in radio ( @xmath17 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and x - rays ( @xmath18 , * ? ? ?",
    ".    at optical wavelengths , only a few faint filaments of balmer line emission from h are visible at the outer rim of the snr .",
    "no evidence for any optical emission other than the balmer h lines was found in the interior of the snr @xcite .",
    "in particular , optical emission from radiatively cooled ejecta has not been detected . in @xcite , the spectrum of the brightest knot in the eastern rim ( knot @xmath19 from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was examined in detail , yielding a velocity between @xmath20 and @xmath21 for the forward shock .",
    "this bright knot , however , is situated in the eastern rim , where the snr is interacting with denser material , and its properties might not be representative of the overall dynamics of the blast wave .    as is often the case with galactic snrs , the distance to tycho is very uncertain .",
    "different techniques yield different and even contradictory results ranging anywhere between 1.5 and 4.5 kpc , with most estimates converging around 2.5 kpc ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) . among these ,",
    "we believe that the most reliable results are obtained through the combination of velocity estimates from knots in the balmer - dominated forward shock with optical proper motions measured over long temporal baselines .",
    "we will adopt the range of 1.5 - 3.1 kpc obtained by @xcite with this method as a conservative estimate for the distance , and we note that the value of 2.8 kpc found by @xcite for sn 1572 falls within this range .",
    "the most fundamental properties of the x - ray emission from the tycho snr have been known since the time of the _ asca _ satellite @xcite , but the quality of the available data has increased dramatically thanks to _ xmm - newton _ @xcite and _ chandra _ @xcite .",
    "morphologically , the x - ray emission from the tycho snr has a shell - like structure with a thin rim of high energy continuum emission .",
    "this rim is coincident in position , but not in brightness , with the outer edge of the radio emission , and traces the position of the forward shock .",
    "the regions interior to this rim show very strong emission lines of si , s , ca , ar and fe , which are thought to arise from the shocked supernova ejecta .",
    "several significant results about the dynamics and x - ray emission of the tycho snr were presented in @xcite , where a principal component analysis technique was applied to a @xmath22 ks _ chandra _ acis - i observation .",
    "@xcite determined the positions of the forward shock ( fs ) , reverse shock ( rs ) and contact discontinuity ( cd ) between ejecta and am , and derived ratios for their average radii of 1:0.93:0.71 ( fs : cd : rs ) . because the cd is so close to the fs , these ratios are incompatible with one - dimensional adiabatic hydrodynamics with @xmath23 for the shocked am .",
    "three explanations for the presence of ejecta close to the fs can be found in the literature : the presence of clumps with a high density contrast in the ejecta @xcite , the effect of cosmic ray ( cr ) acceleration at the fs @xcite , and the interaction of rayleigh - taylor fingers with circumstellar cloudlets @xcite . the last mechanism is unlikely to be relevant in the case of the tycho snr , because there is no known process that would produce an almost isotropic distribution of cloudlets in the circumstellar environment of a type ia sn progenitor ( see figure 4 in * ? ? ?",
    "* for the azimuthal distribution of fs and cd radii ) .",
    "according to @xcite , the absence of prominent variations in the spectral properties of the ejecta along the cd seems to favor cr acceleration over ejecta clumping as the dominating mechanism .",
    "@xcite also found that the properties of the x - ray emission from the shocked am are compatible with a cr - dominated blast wave . on one hand ,",
    "the emitting region behind the fs is much thinner than would be predicted by the thermal emission behind an adiabatic shock ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the featureless spectra extracted from the shocked ambient medium ( am ) were well fitted by a power law with an index of @xmath24 .",
    "this value is consistent with the index of @xmath25 found in the high energy _ ginga _",
    "observations by @xcite . fits with thermal models at @xmath26 are also possible , but they require extremely low values for the ionization timescale ( a few times @xmath27 , * ? ? ? * ) , which are incompatible with the basic properties of the tycho snr ( see the discussion in   7.4.1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* )    the emission from the shocked ejecta , as seen in the spectral bands corresponding to the most prominent emission lines from heavy elements , has a shell - like morphology , with the fe k@xmath1 line image appearing more diffuse and peaking at a smaller radius than the others @xcite .",
    "the fe k@xmath1 emission is not only spatially distinct from the other lines ( including the fe l complex ) ; it also has different spectral properties , with a higher temperature and a lower ionization timescale @xcite .",
    "the apparent symmetry of the x - ray line emission and the absence of significant doppler shifts suggests an overall spherical geometry , but local inhomogeneities in the line emission are manifest , particularly in the form of bright clumps in the southeast ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the goal of this paper is to model the thermal x - ray emission from the shocked ejecta in the tycho snr using the grid of synthetic spectra presented in papers i and ii . our objective is to use these synthetic spectra to constrain the physics of the type ia sn explosion that gave birth to the remnant in 1572 .",
    "we shall make no attempt to model the featureless emission from the shocked am .",
    "instead , we adopt the view expressed in @xcite that this emission is predominantly nonthermal , and that the dynamics of the fs are strongly modified by cr acceleration .",
    "although the one - dimensional hydrodynamic calculations with @xmath23 that underlie our synthetic spectra can not reproduce the properties of the shocked am or the dynamics of the fs under these conditions , this is not a serious drawback .",
    "several fundamental quantities like the temperature of the shocked am or the expansion parameter of the fs are not known with a significant degree of accuracy ( see the discussions in   [ sub : obs - radio - optical ] and   [ sub : obs - x - ray ] ) .",
    "rather than use these poorly determined quantities to constrain the hydrodynamic models underlying our synthetic spectra , we attempt to reproduce the observed x - ray emission first and then verify that the snr dynamics is compatible with the known properties of the am and fs .",
    "regardless of the conditions at the fs , we believe that our hydrodynamic models with @xmath23 are a good approximation for the dynamics of the shocked ejecta .",
    "diffusive shock acceleration is mediated by strong magnetic fields , and leads to high compression ratios and low temperatures in the shocked plasma ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "from an observational point of view , both the position of the rs measured by @xcite , deep into the ejecta and away from the cd , and the strong fe k@xmath1 emission that originates from the hot plasma just behind the rs are strong arguments against efficient cr acceleration at the rs . from a theoretical point of view , it is hard to see how the necessary magnetic fields could have survived for hundreds of years inside the freely expanding sn ejecta , even making the most optimistic assumptions about the initial magnetic field strength in the progenitor systems of type ia sne .",
    "as we discussed in paper ii (   a.2 ) , a detailed comparison between our synthetic spectra and observations is not straightforward . on one hand , the uncertainties in the atomic data and other factors",
    "do not make the model spectra amenable to the usual @xmath28 fitting techniques , and on the other hand , the parameter space is very large even for one - dimensional calculations . in the present work ,",
    "we solve these problems by taking advantage of the characteristics of the x - ray emission from the tycho snr to devise an efficient comparison strategy .",
    "first , we extract spatially integrated spectra from large regions in the snr , and determine the fundamental properties of the high - energy ( @xmath29 kev ) line emission (   [ sec : line - emission ] ) . as we have seen in ",
    "[ sub : obs - x - ray ] , this line emission comes entirely from the shocked ejecta , so we use the observed line flux ratios and line centroids to reduce the dimensionality of the problem .",
    "we require that our synthetic x - ray spectra reproduce as many of these flux ratios and centroids as possible , and in the process we identify the most successful type ia sn explosion models and the most promising regions of the associated parameter space (   [ sec : line - emission - models ] ) .",
    "finally , we compare the best models to the entire spatially integrated spectrum , applying several consistency checks to the requirements of each model , such as interstellar absorption , am flux , and derived distance estimates (   [ sec : modeling - integrated_spectrum ] ) .",
    "among the publicly available x - ray observations of the tycho snr , the best spatially integrated spectra are provided by the epic mos cameras on board _ xmm - newton_. the observation analyzed in @xcite has a total exposure time of about 12 ks for each of the epic mos ccds , providing spectra of good quality for this bright object . since our models are one - dimensional , we focus on the western sector of tycho , avoiding the prominent inhomogeneities in the ejecta emission found in the southeast and the interaction with a denser am towards the northeast ( see discussion in   [ sub : obs - radio - optical ] and   [ sub : obs - x - ray ] ) . in the west ,",
    "the ejecta emission is homogeneous , and the fs has a smooth , almost circular shape . using the standard _ xmm - newton _ science analysis system , we have selected two spectral extraction regions in the epic mos1 image ( see fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] ) .",
    "region a covers the entire western sector between two major outbreaks in the fs in the north and south ; it corresponds loosely to region v in @xcite , with a range in position angle of @xmath30 degrees ( counterclockwise from the north ) .",
    "region b is a subset of region a , covering the range @xmath31 , and has been selected to exclude an area in the northwest that shows an increased flux in the fe and si emission ( see figs . 2 and 3 in * ?",
    "the spectra extracted from regions a and b are shown in figure [ fig-2 ] .",
    "many of the lines and line complexes in the spectra of figure [ fig-2 ] are blended due to the limited spectral resolution of ccd cameras in the x - ray band . in order to characterize the properties of the line emission in regions",
    "a and b , we have fitted the extracted spectra between 1.65 and 9.0 kev with a model adapted from @xcite , consisting of fourteen gaussian lines plus two components for the continuum ( a thermal bremsstrahlung and a power law ) , attenuated by the interstellar absorption . for the neutral hydrogen column density , we have adopted a value of @xmath32 , which is compatible with the @xmath33 range found by @xcite from fits to the integrated asca spectrum .",
    "it is also close to the values determined by fitting the",
    "_ chandra _",
    "spectra in several locations along the western rim with nonthermal models : @xmath34 @xcite ; @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "conversion of the value of @xmath36 obtained by @xcite to @xmath37 with the @xmath36@xmath37 relation of @xcite yields a lower column density of @xmath38 , but the uncertainties associated with this estimate are large . we stress that the interstellar absorption in the x - ray band is hard to constrain in objects with complex spectra such as snrs , and variation of @xmath37 across the surface of an object as extended as tycho can not be discarded ( see   [ sub : comparing ] for a discussion ) . for the power law index ,",
    "we have adopted the value of 2.72 found by @xcite and confirmed by @xcite .",
    "the fits to regions a and b are shown in figure [ fig-3 ] .",
    "the statistics for the fit to region a are @xmath39 with @xmath40 , and for region b @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "the fitted temperatures for the thermal bremsstrahlung component are 0.48 and 0.40 kev , respectively .",
    "we note that these values are rather different from those obtained by @xcite assuming a purely thermal continuum ( these authors used a main component at 0.99 kev , with another at 10.0 kev to reproduce the high energy continuum ) .",
    "the fourteen lines included in the model , along with the fitted centroids and fluxes , are given in table [ tab-1 ] , where the common notation of @xmath1 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 has been used to label the lines corresponding to transitions from quantum levels 2 , 3 , and 4 to level 1 .",
    "the quality of the data set did not allow the centroids of the weakest lines to be fitted independently , so these parameters were fixed .",
    "the he@xmath44/he@xmath43 line flux ratios of si , s and ar , and the si ly@xmath43/si ly@xmath1 ratio , were also fixed in the fits to the values listed in table [ tab-1 ] , which correspond to the values at @xmath45 .",
    "this allows for an adequate ( if simple ) treatment of these blended lines , and is justified because the flux ratios vary by only 10%-20% over a decade in temperature ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "the most important line flux ratios are listed in table [ tab-2 ] . for these flux ratios ,",
    "we have used the s he@xmath1 blend as a reference instead of si he@xmath1 in order to make their values less dependent on @xmath37 .",
    "an inspection of tables [ tab-1 ] and [ tab-2 ] reveals that the properties of the line emission in the western half of tycho are remarkably uniform .",
    "indeed , the only noticeable differences between the two extraction regions are in the centroids of the ar he@xmath1 , ca he@xmath1 and fe k@xmath1 blends , which are a few ev lower in region b ( the deviation is below 0.5% in all cases , and within the 90% confidence ranges for ca he@xmath1 and fe k@xmath1 ) .",
    "this suggests a lower ionization state for these elements in region b , but the origin of this lower ionization and its relationship to the brightening in the ejecta emission in the northern part of region a is unclear . in the absence of a plausible physical interpretation for these effects ,",
    "we use region b as representative of the shocked ejecta emission in the reminder of the paper , but we stress that the differences between regions a and b are very small . our _ xmm - newton _ results for the western half of tycho are very similar to those obtained by @xcite for the _ asca _ observation of the entire snr .",
    "although the measurements were made in different regions of the snr , assuming different values for @xmath37 , with different models for the continuum , and with different instruments , the error bars overlap in almost all the line flux ratios and centroids , and the deviations are never larger than a few percent .",
    "the only case where this is not true is the centroid of the ca he@xmath1 blend ( 3.879 and 3.867 kev in regions a and b vs. 3.818 kev in * ? ? ?",
    "the neighboring ar he@xmath43 line is stronger in our fits , shifting the ca he@xmath1 centroid towards higher energies that are closer to the expected value of 3.88 kev .",
    "the method to generate the synthetic x - ray spectra that we use to model the line emission from the tycho snr is described in papers i and ii . for each type ia",
    "sn explosion model , we simulate the interaction of the ejecta with a uniform am using a one - dimensional hydrodynamic code .",
    "we assume that the plasma is a nonrelativistic monoatomic ideal gas with @xmath23 .",
    "then we calculate the nonequilibrium ionization ( nei ) and associated processes for each fluid element in the shocked ejecta , taking as inputs the temporal evolution of density and specific internal energy from the hydrodynamic simulation and the chemical composition from the sn explosion model .",
    "to perform these calculations , we use a method adapted from @xcite , which takes into account important details that are relevant to the specific case of a plasma dominated by heavy elements .",
    "in particular , the influence of the large number of electrons ejected during the ongoing ionization on variables like the plasma temperature ( noted by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is dealt with in a self - consistent way .",
    "once the electron temperatures and ionization states in all the shocked ejecta are calculated in this way , a spatially integrated x - ray spectrum is produced using an appropriate spectral code .",
    "this simulation scheme does not take into account radiative or ionization losses or thermal conduction in the shocked plasma .",
    "@xcite showed that ionization and radiative losses are of the same order in a plasma dominated by heavy elements . in order to assess the importance of these processes , we applied the _ post - facto _ estimation of radiative losses described in section 3.5 of paper i and section a.3 of paper ii to all the models presented here .",
    "we found that radiative losses are unimportant for an object of the age of the tycho snr , with only a few inconsequential exceptions that we will specify in ",
    "[ sub : successful - models ] .",
    "this is in agreement with both the conspicuous absence of optically emitting ejecta ( see   [ sub : obs - radio - optical ] ) and the results of simulations that do include radiative and ionization losses , like @xcite .",
    "these authors also showed that efficient thermal conduction destroys any temperature gradients on timescales that are shorter than the age of the tycho snr .",
    "thus , the presence of efficient thermal conduction is incompatible with the spatial morphology of the fe k@xmath1 and fe l emission in the tycho snr ( see   [ sub : obs - x - ray ] ) , which implies that a temperature gradient must exist in the shocked ejecta .",
    "the synthetic spectra for the shocked sn ejecta are characterized by four parameters only : the type ia sn explosion model used , the age of the snr @xmath46 , the density of the am @xmath47 , and the ratio between the specific internal energies of the electrons and ions at the reverse shock , @xmath48 , which represents the efficiency of collisionless electron heating .",
    "the dependence of the ejecta x - ray emission on each of these parameters is discussed in papers i and ii .",
    "the 32 type ia sn explosion models presented in papers i and ii include examples of all the paradigms described in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] . among these , we have selected a more convenient subgrid of 12 models : three delayed detonations ( ddta , ddtc , and ddte ) , three pulsating delayed detonations ( pdda , pddc , and pdde ) , three deflagrations ( defa , defc , and deff ) , one prompt detonation ( det ) , one sub - chandrasekhar explosion ( sch ) , and one deflagration calculated in three dimensions with a smooth particle hydrodynamics code ( b30u from * ? ? ?",
    "in order to benchmark the results obtained using this subgrid of models , we have chosen to add three well - known type ia sn explosion models calculated by other groups : model w7 @xcite , a ` fast deflagration ' that has become a widespread standard for comparison with observations of type ia sne , model 5p0z22.25 @xcite , a delayed detonation calculated with a resolution 4 times greater than the ddt models of our grid , and model b30_3d_768 @xcite , a deflagration calculated in three dimensions with an eulerian code and a high spatial resolution .    of the three remaining parameters in the synthetic spectra , the age @xmath46 is known to be 433 years for the tycho snr ( 428 years at the time of the _ xmm - newton _ observation ) .",
    "thus , only @xmath47 and @xmath43 can be varied for each of our type ia sn explosion models .",
    "we have sampled this parameter space with five points in @xmath47 ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 ) and three points in @xmath43 ( @xmath54 , with @xmath55 the mean preshock ionization state , @xmath56 the electron mass and @xmath57 the average ion mass , see   2.2 in paper ii . ] , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 ) , setting @xmath46 to 430 yr in all the models .",
    "these ranges are selected to encompass the likely values of @xmath43 ( see discussion in   2.2 of paper ii ) and @xmath47 in the tycho snr .",
    "for each type ia sn explosion model , 15 synthetic snr spectra have been generated , for a total of 225 synthetic spectra .",
    "we have selected thirteen observable parameters as diagnostic quantities for the comparison between our models and the observations : the eight line flux ratios listed in table [ tab-3 ] ( he@xmath60/he@xmath1 and ly@xmath1/he@xmath1 ratios for si and s , and the ratios of the he@xmath1 blends of si , ar , and ca , and the k@xmath1 blend of fe , relative to s he@xmath1 ) , plus the centroids of the si he@xmath1 , s he@xmath1 , ar he@xmath1 , ca he@xmath1 , and fe k@xmath1 blends . in the synthetic spectra , the properties of the line emission are sensitive to variations in @xmath43 , @xmath47 , and the type ia sn explosion model . the model with 14 gaussian lines used in ",
    "[ sec : line - emission ] to derive the observed values for the thirteen diagnostic quantities can not be applied to these synthetic spectra , because some of its underlying assumptions ( like the fixed value for the he@xmath44/he@xmath43 flux ratios ) might break down in extreme cases .",
    "however , the calculation of line fluxes and centroids in the synthetic spectra is straightforward if it is performed before convolution with an instrumental response . in this format ,",
    "the lines that contribute to a given blend can be singled out in most cases without the risk of contamination from neighboring lines , and the continuum can be subtracted easily .",
    "the selection energy windows for each of the lines in the unconvolved model spectra are listed in table [ tab-3 ] .",
    "we have verified that these two methods used to determine line fluxes and ratios in the observed spectra and in the synthetic spectra give consistent results .",

    "the volume of x - ray emitting ejecta can be estimated from the measured locations of the rs and cd given by @xcite ( vertical dotted lines in fig .",

    "this volume is always considerably larger than the volume occupied by the ejecta in our one - dimensional models , assuming the rs radius in the models matches that of tycho . as we have discussed in the previous section , this is probably due to the effect of rayleigh - taylor instabilities at the cd .",
    "whatever the cause , spreading a fixed mass of shocked ejecta over a larger volume will decrease the average density , reducing the intrinsic emissivity of the model and lowering the inferred normalization distance @xmath88 .",

    "after the passage of the rs , the development of rt fingers will enhance the adiabatic expansion of the fluid element , reducing the density in the postshock evolution .",
    "the extent of this reduction can be estimated by looking at figure 4 in @xcite : at the age of the tycho snr , the angle - averaged density profile affected by rti only shows a factor 2 decrease with respect to the highest density ejecta in a one - dimensional simulation ( which is just behind the cd ) . in this region , the high density rt fingers penetrate into the low density shocked am , with the latter component filling most of the volume ( see figure 2 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so the actual drop in density of the shocked ejecta should be less than a factor 2 .",

    "therefore , it does not seem unreasonable to think that the flux emitted by the shocked ejecta may drop by @xmath139 ( driving @xmath88 in the ddt models into the expected range ) , without major changes being introduced to the value of @xmath134 and @xmath135 inside each fluid element and hence to the properties of the spatially integrated spectrum . in this context",

    "however , we insist that detailed multi - dimensional simulations are required to investigate these issues .",
    "we plan to perform such simulations in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we conclude that the discrepancy between @xmath88 and @xmath96 that we have encountered might be an intrinsic feature of one - dimensional calculations . from what we know about the structure and growth of rt fingers at the cd , their effect on the properties of the synthetic spectra in terms of ionization timescales and electron temperatures",
    "might be limited . from a practical point of view",
    ", the presence of rti at the cd might modify the optimum value of @xmath47 for a given type ia sn explosion model , but it is very unlikely that it will make viable the synthetic spectrum of a model that did not prove valid in a one - dimensional calculation .",
    "the main result of our work is that one - dimensional delayed detonation models are successful in reproducing the fundamental properties of the x - ray emission from the shocked ejecta in the tycho snr .",
    "none of the other explosion paradigms that we have tested ( prompt detonations , sub - chandrasekhar explosions , pulsating delayed detonations , one - dimensional deflagrations and three - dimensional deflagrations ) shows a comparable level of success , and most of them fail even simple comparisons to the observations .",
    "the delayed detonation models reproduce 12 out of the 13 diagnostic quantities for the line emission ( see figs .",
    "[ fig-4 ] , [ fig-5 ] , and [ fig-6 ] ; and tables [ tab-4 ] and [ tab-5 ] ) , and they provide good approximations to the spatially integrated _ xmm - newton _ spectrum at high energies ( see fig.[fig-7 ] ) .",
    "all the delayed detonation models that we have tested require similar values of @xmath47 ( @xmath140 for our grid ddt models , @xmath141 for the ` off - grid ' model 5p0z22.25 ) and @xmath43 ( between 0.01 and 0.1 ) .",
    "these values lead to estimates for the distance @xmath96 , the nonthermal flux from the shocked am @xmath108 , and ( in the case of model ddtc ) the hydrogen column density @xmath37 , which are fully consistent with the available observational constraints .",
    "we emphasize that , by taking these estimates into account , we are evaluating our models from a global point of view , not based on the properties of their synthetic spectra alone .",
    "we have also shown that the spatial morphology of the line emission predicted by delayed detonation models with partial collisionless electron heating is roughly consistent with the _ chandra _ observations of the tycho snr , at least within the limitations of one - dimensional models .",
    "the inconsistency between the distance estimates from matching the rs radius ( @xmath96 ) and from the normalization of the spectrum ( @xmath88 ) that we found in all the models could also be related to the limitations of our one - dimensional hydrodynamic calculations .",
    "a detailed study of the effect of the rayleigh - taylor instability on the x - ray emission from the shocked ejecta would be necessary to gain further insight on the spatial morphology of the line emission and the values of @xmath88 .",
    "we believe that the unavoidable limitations of one - dimensional simulations do not compromise our results concerning delayed detonation models ( see discussion in [ sub : limitations - models ] ) .",
    "this is specially true because we have found no alternative paradigm with an acceptable level of success whose predictions could be reconciled with the observations by invoking the limited modifications that we expect from multi - dimensional effects like rti .",
    "we note that our conclusions do not agree with those of @xcite , who show a preference for three - dimensional deflagrations for the tycho snr .",
    "however , these authors only consider two deflagration models ( w7 and a model similar to b30_3d_768 ) , and their results are based on a very simple qualitative comparison between models and observations .",
    "to evaluate the merits of our slightly different approaches on an equal footing , synthetic spectra from delayed detonation models should be produced using the methods of @xcite , and they should be compared to the observations in a rigorous , quantitative way .      among the delayed detonation models that we have tested , model ddtc ( @xmath143 , @xmath99 ) gives by far the best approximation to the spatially integrated x - ray spectrum .",
    "the performance of this model is surprisingly good : despite the limitations of our one - dimensional calculations and the large uncertainties in the atomic data used to generate the synthetic spectra , the model can reproduce the fluxes and centroids of almost all the lines from o , si , s , ar , ca and fe in the shocked ejecta between 0.6 and 7.0 kev ( see fig . [ fig-7 ] ) . our preference for this model",
    "is based on the constraints posed by the spectrum at low energies ( below 1 kev ) on the main parameter involved in delayed detonation explosions , the transition density from deflagration to detonation @xmath3 .",
    "model ddtc matches both the fe l / fe k@xmath1 flux ratio and the o ly@xmath1 emission for a reasonable value of @xmath37 ( @xmath144 ) , unlike models with higher or lower @xmath3 such as ddta or ddte .",
    "the second most successful delayed detonation model , 5p0z22.25 , although calculated using a different sn explosion code , is very similar to ddtc .",

    "given the fact that the estimates of @xcite are based on naked eye observations , and the large range of peak bolometric magnitudes in our type ia sn model grid ( more than 2 mag , see table 1 in paper i ) , this can be considered a good agreement .",
    "an explosion that synthesizes @xmath159 of @xmath160 ( like model ddtc ) is consistent with the hypothesis that sn 1572 was a ` normal ' type ia sn , and not a subluminous event .",

    "* and references therein ) vs. modeling the dynamics of the shocked plasma in type ia snrs .",
    "one advantage of snrs is that the emitting plasma is optically thin , and all the elements can be seen in the x - rays at the same time .",

    "we conclude with a reminder that , despite their apparent success , delayed detonations are just a phenomenological model for type ia sne . since this explosion paradigm was first proposed by @xcite , all attempts to provide a physically consistent mechanism that can explain the transition from deflagration to detonation have failed .",
