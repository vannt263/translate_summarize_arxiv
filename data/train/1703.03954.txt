    "assumption is a technical assumption .",

    "furthermore , we assume that @xmath99 this , also , is a natural assumption for mfgs from the regularity theory perspective . the , now standard , uniqueness proof for mfg systems in @xcite is valid only for @xmath100 in this range .",
    "this is a strong indication of degeneracy for @xmath100 outside of this range ( which is observed and discussed in detail in @xcite ) .",

    "we discuss the case @xmath40 .",
    "firstly , we observe that @xmath40 can occur only when @xmath101 . recall that in this paper we are concerned only with smooth solutions .",

    "if @xmath118 then @xmath119 can be chosen arbitrarily , so and may have infinite number of solutions .",
    "thus , if @xmath115 for some @xmath116 degenerates in different ways when @xmath40 .    furthermore , if @xmath120 for all @xmath121 then @xmath29 , at least formally , is given by . here",
    "we face two potential problems .",
    "first , one has to make sense of the formula .",
    "in other words , the series in may not be summable in any appropriate sense .",
    "moreover , summability of is a delicate issue and strongly depends on the relation between @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "additionally , even if the series converge to a smooth function , we still have the necessary condition @xmath124 and that might fail depending on @xmath125 and @xmath41 . for instance , if @xmath125 is such that @xmath126 for all @xmath127 , and @xmath41 is such that @xmath120 for all @xmath121 we get that @xmath128 therefore , @xmath129 if and only if @xmath130 .",
