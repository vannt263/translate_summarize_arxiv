    "two problems that have attracted much attention in the quantum information community are the mub and sic problems for hilbert spaces of finite dimension @xmath0 . in the mub problem",
    "@xcite one looks for @xmath1 orthonormal bases that are mutually unbiased , in the sense that    @xmath2    whenever the vector @xmath3 belongs to one basis and the vector @xmath4 to another . in the sic problem",
    "@xcite one looks for a symmetric and informationally complete povm , which translates to the problem of finding @xmath5 unit vectors @xmath6 such that    @xmath7    whenever @xmath8 .",
    "these problems are hard . for the mub problem an elegant solution exists whenever @xmath0 is a power of a prime @xcite . for the sic problem quite ad hoc looking",
    "analytic solutions are known for eighteen different dimensions ; these are described ( and in some cases derived ) by scott and grassl , who also give full references to the earlier literature @xcite .",
    "the belief in the community is that a complete set of @xmath1 mub does not exist for general @xmath0 , while the sics do .    since the problems are so easy to state , it is not surprising that they have been posed independently in many different branches of science .",
    "one purpose of this article is to describe what nineteenth century geometers had to say about them .",
    "a story told by eddington @xcite is relevant here :    some years ago i worked out the structure of this group of operators in connection with dirac s theory of the electron .",
    "i afterwards learned that a great deal of what i had written was to be found in a treatise on kummer s quartic surface .",
    "there happens to be a model of kummer s quartic surface in my lecture - room , at which i had sometimes glanced with curiosity , wondering what it was all about .",
    "the last thing that entered my head was that i had written ( somewhat belatedly ) a paper on its structure .",
    "perhaps the author of the treatise would have been equally surprised to learn that he was dealing with the behaviour of an electron .",
    "we will see what eddington saw as we proceed .",
    "meanwhile , let us observe that when @xmath0 is a prime the mub are the eigenbases of the @xmath1 cyclic subgroups of the heisenberg group , while there is a conjecture ( enjoying very considerable numerical support @xcite ) that the sics can always be chosen to be special orbits of this group .",
    "when @xmath0 is a power of a prime the solution of the mub problem shifts a little , since the mubs now consist of eigenvectors of the cyclic subgroups of the heisenberg group defined over a finite field rather than over the ring of integers modulo @xmath0 . concerning sics that are orbits under the heisenberg group there is a link to the mub problem : if the dimension @xmath0 is a prime the sic bloch vectors , when projected onto any one of the mub eigenvalue simplices , have the same length for all the @xmath1 mub @xcite .    in mathematics",
    "elliptic curves provide the natural home for the heisenberg group , so it seems natural to investigate if elliptic curves can be used to illuminate the mub and sic problems . in dimensions",
    "3 @xcite and 4 they certainly can , as we will see , but in higher dimensions i am not so sure",
    ". there will be some comments and formulas that i could not find in the books and papers i studied , but keeping eddington s example in mind i do not claim originality for them .",
    "we had better define the heisenberg group properly .",
    "a defining non - unitary representation is given by the upper triangular matrices    @xmath9    here the matrix elements belong to some ring .",
    "in the original weyl - heisenberg group @xcite they are real numbers , but here we are more interested in the case that they belong to the ring of integers modulo @xmath0 .",
    "we denote the resulting group by @xmath10 .",
    "it is generated by two elements @xmath11 and @xmath12 obeying    @xmath13    for @xmath14 we can use the pauli matrices to set @xmath15 , @xmath16 , which makes it possible to remember the notation .",
    "we will consider the group projectively , so for our purposes it can often be regarded as a group of order @xmath5 .    because @xmath17 is a primitive @xmath0th root of unity the unitary representation in which @xmath12 is diagonal is unique up to permutations @xcite .",
    "it is known as the clock and shift representation .",
    "if the components of any vector are denoted @xmath18 the action is given by    @xmath19    the unitary automorphism group of the heisenberg group plays prominent roles in quantum information theory @xcite , and is often called the clifford group . in the older literature the heisenberg group",
    "is sometimes called the clifford collineation group , and the clifford group is called the clifford transform group @xcite . although we will discuss it in detail for the case @xmath20 later on",
    ", we will mostly be concerned with automorphisms of order 2 . in the clock and shift representation such an automorphism acts according to    @xmath21    adding this generator leads us to consider an extended group which is twice as large as @xmath10 . in quantum information language the involution @xmath22 is generated by one of wootters phase point operators @xcite .",
    "finally there is the curious conjecture @xcite that the sic vectors are always left invariant by a unitary automorphism of the heisenberg group having order 3 .",
    "no one knows why this should be so , but it does appear to be true @xcite , and in four dimensions we will see exactly how it happens .",
    "what is special about the case when @xmath0 is prime is that @xmath10 then admits @xmath1 cyclic subgroups of order @xmath0 , forming a flower with @xmath1 petals with only the unit element in common .",
    "correspondingly there are @xmath1 eigenbases , and they necessarily form a complete set of mub @xcite . in prime power dimensions @xmath23 the known complete set of mub is the set of eigenbases of the cyclic subgroups of a heisenberg group defined over a galois field .",
    "the only case we will discuss is when @xmath24 , for which the galois heisenberg group is the tensor product @xmath25 .",
    "another piece of background information is that sics and mubs look natural in bloch space , which is the @xmath26 dimensional space of hermitean operators of trace 1 , considered as a vector space with the trace inner product and with the maximally mixed state at the origin .",
    "density matrices form a convex body in bloch space .",
    "a sic is simply a regular simplex in bloch space , inscribed into this convex body .",
    "but it is not easy to rotate the simplex while keeping the body of density matrices fixed , because the symmetry group of this body is only @xmath27 , a rather small subgroup of @xmath28 as soon as @xmath29 .",
    "this is why the sic problem is hard .",
    "an orthonormal basis is a regular simplex with only @xmath0 corners , spanning some @xmath30-plane through the origin in bloch space .",
    "two bases are mutually unbiased if the corresponding @xmath30-planes are totally orthogonal , from which it immediately follows that no more than @xmath1 mub can exist .",
    "any pure state corresponds to a bloch vector of a definite length . given a complete set of mub we can project this vector onto the @xmath1 different @xmath30-planes defined by the mub .",
    "should it happen that these projected vectors all have the same length the vector is as it were unbiased with respect to the mub , and is then  for some reason  called a minimum uncertainty state @xcite . the condition on a state vector to be unbiased in this sense is easily worked out using the euclidean metric on bloch space in conjunction with pythagoras theorem .",
    "choose any one of the mub as the computational basis , and express the hilbert space components of a unit vector with respect to that basis as    @xmath31    if the corresponding bloch vector projected onto the @xmath30-plane spanned by the computational basis has the length appropriate to a minimum uncertainty state it must be true that    @xmath32    this is simple enough , but there is the complication that this has to be done for all the @xmath1 mub , which will give an additional set of @xmath0 constraints on the phases ensuring that the vector has the appropriate length when projected to the other mub planes .",
    "we spare the reader from the details , but we repeat that all heisenberg covariant sic vectors are",
    "minimum uncertainty states whenever @xmath0 is a prime . examining the proof of this interesting statement shows that something similar is true also when no complete set of mub is available : in any eigenbasis of a cyclic subgroup of @xmath10 of order @xmath0 eq .",
    "( [ mus ] ) will hold for any vector belonging to a heisenberg covariant sic @xcite .",
    "this is true regardless of how many bases of this kind there are .",
    "we now descend to the complex projective plane , and begin by introducing the language used by nineteenth century geometers .",
    "points are represented by ket or column vectors in @xmath33 , or more precisely by one - dimensional subspaces , while lines are represented by two - dimensional subspaces . using the scalar product in hilbert space we can",
    "equally well represent the lines by bra or row vectors orthogonal to the subspaces they represent , so that the relation    @xmath34    means that the point @xmath11 lies on the line @xmath35 .",
    "the two - dimensional subspace representing the line consists of all vectors whose scalar product with the bra vector @xmath36 vanishes .",
    "since there is a one - to - one correspondence @xmath37 between bras and kets there is also a one - to - one correspondence between points and lines . clearly eq .",
    "( [ ett ] ) implies that    @xmath38    which says that the point @xmath35 lies on the line @xmath11 .",
    "this is known as the duality between points and lines in the projective plane .",
    "we will study complex plane curves defined by homogeneous polynomials in three variables .",
    "linear polynomials define two - dimensional subspaces , that is to say two real - dimensional subsets of the complex plane , and by the above they define projective lines .",
    "intrinsically they are spheres , namely bloch spheres , because @xmath39 .",
    "quadratic polynomials or quadrics define conic sections , and over the complex numbers the intrinsic geometry of a conic section is again that of a sphere .",
    "the set of spin coherent states is an example @xcite . to the next order in complication",
    "we choose a cubic polynomial .",
    "we require the curve to transform into itself under the heisenberg group in the clock and shift representation ( [ group ] ) .",
    "up to an irrelevant overall constant the most general solution for the cubic is then    @xmath40    here @xmath41 is a complex number parametrising what is known as the syzygetic hesse pencil of cubics .",
    "intrinsically each cubic is a torus rather than a sphere .",
    "we observe that the polynomial is automatically invariant under the additional involution @xmath22 given above in ( [ a ] ) .",
    "hesse @xcite , and before him plcker @xcite , studied this family of curves in detail .",
    "their first object was to determine the inflection points .",
    "they are given by those points on the curve for which the determinant of its matrix of second derivatives  its hessian  vanishes .",
    "in the present case this is a cubic polynomial as well ; in fact    @xmath42    this is again a member of the hesse pencil of cubics . in astronomy",
    "a `` syzygy '' occurs when three planets lie on a line , so we can begin to appreciate why the pencil is called `` syzygetic '' .",
    "the inflection points are given by @xmath43 .",
    "by bzout s theorem two cubics in the complex projective plane intersect in nine points , hence there are nine inflection points .",
    "they coincide for all cubics in the pencil , and are given by    @xmath44 \\ . \\label{points}\\ ] ]    this is recognisable as a set of nine sic vectors covariant under the heisenberg group @xcite .",
    "we can normalise our vectors if we want to , but in the spirit of projective geometry we choose not to .",
    "there are four singular members of the hesse pencil , defined by values of the parameter @xmath41 such that there are non - zero solutions to @xmath45 .",
    "these values are    @xmath46    if @xmath47 the polynomial reduces to @xmath48 . in this case",
    "the singular cubic consists of three projective lines that make up a triangle .",
    "the remaining three singular cases will give rise to three other triangles .",
    "therefore the syzygetic pencil singles out 4 special triangles in the projective plane , given by their 12 vertices    @xmath49 \\ , \\hspace{6 mm }   \\triangle^{(1 ) } = \\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc } 1 & q^2 & q^2 \\\\ q^2 & 1 & q^2 \\\\   q^2 & q^2 & 1 \\end{array } \\right ] \\ ,",
    "\\hspace{12 mm } \\nonumber \\\\   \\label{mub3 } \\\\",
    "\\triangle^{(2 ) } = \\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc } 1 & q & q \\\\ q & 1 & q \\\\",
    "q & q & 1 \\end{array } \\right ] \\ , \\hspace{8 mm }   \\triangle^{(\\infty ) } = \\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc } 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & q & q^2 \\\\   1 & q^2 & q \\end{array } \\right ] \\ , \\hspace{12 mm } \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath50 .",
    "the columns , labelled consecutively by @xmath51 , can indeed be regarded as 12 points or by duality as 12 lines .",
    "the four triangles are referred to as the inflection triangles .    what gives the triangles their name is the remarkable fact that the nine inflection points lie by threes on their twelve edges .",
    "hesse calls this a `` _ schnen lehrsatz _ '' , and attributes it to plcker @xcite .",
    "it is not hard to verify . after a small calculation",
    "one finds that the orthogonalities between the columns in the four triangles and the vectors representing the inflection points are as follows :    thus we have    @xmath52    and so on . recalling the interpretation of the vanishing scalar products we see by inspection of the table that hesse s beautiful theorem is true .",
    "we have verified that there exists a configuration of 9 points and 12 lines such that each point belongs to four lines , and each line goes through three points .",
    "this is denoted @xmath53 , and is known as the hesse configuration . using",
    "the duality between points and lines we have also proved the existence of the configuration @xmath54 . from an abstract point of view such a configuration is a combinatorial object known as a finite affine plane @xcite . in the language of quantum information theory the inflection triangles form a complete set of four mub , while the inflection points form a sic .",
    "we can now expand on our discussion of group theory in section 2 .",
    "first , every plane cubic can be regarded as a commutative group in a natural way .",
    "this is not surprising , given that the curve is intrinsically a torus  that is a group manifold .",
    "the idea relies on bzout s theorem , which this time assures us that any line intersects the cubic in three points  two of which coincide if the line is a tangent , and all of which coincide if the line is a line of inflection .",
    "an arbitrary point on the cubic is taken to be the identity element , and denoted @xmath55 . to add two arbitrary points @xmath22 and @xmath56 on the cubic , draw the line between them and locate its third intersection point @xmath57 with the cubic .",
    "then draw the line between @xmath55 and @xmath57 and again locate the third intersection point @xmath58 . by definition then @xmath59 . all the group axioms are obeyed , although it is non - trivial to prove associativity .",
    "now choose the origin to sit at one of the inflection points .",
    "with hesse s construction in hand one sees that the nine inflection points form a group of order nine , which is precisely the projective heisenberg group .",
    "this is also the torsion group of the curve , meaning that it contains all group elements of finite order .",
    "because they are group elements of order 3 the inflection points are also called 3-torsion points .    next we ask for the group of transformations transforming the cubics of the hesse pencil among themselves .",
    "recall that the parameter @xmath41 in the hesse cubic ( [ cubic ] ) can serve as a complex coordinate on a sphere .",
    "the four singular members of the pencil defines a tetrahedron on that sphere .",
    "transformations within the pencil act as mbius transformations on the complex number @xmath41 .",
    "moreover they must permute the singular members of the hesse pencil among themselves .",
    "this means that they form a well known subgroup of @xmath60 , namely the symmetry group @xmath61 of the regular tetrahedron .",
    "it enjoys the isomorphism    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the field of integers modulo 3 .",
    "the group @xmath64 consists of unimodular two by two matrices with integer entries taken modulo three ; here only its projective part enters because the subgroup generated by the matrix @xmath65 gives rise to the involution @xmath22 and does not act on @xmath41 , although it does permute the inflection points among themselves .",
    "the full symmetry group of the pencil is a semi - direct product of the heisenberg group and @xmath64 .",
    "this is the affine group on a finite affine plane .",
    "it is known as the hessian group @xcite , or as the clifford group .",
    "there are many accounts of this material in the literature , from geometric @xcite , undergraduate @xcite , and modern @xcite points of view .",
    "it forms a recurrent theme in klein s history of nineteenth century mathematics @xcite .",
    "the fact that the inflection points form a sic was first noted by lane hughston @xcite .",
    "felix klein and the people around him put considerable effort into the description of elliptic curves embedded into projective spaces of dimension higher than 2 .",
    "they proceeded by means of explicit parametrisations of the curve using weierstrass @xmath66-function @xcite .",
    "as far as we are concerned now , we only need to know that the symmetries they built into their curves is again the heisenberg group supplemented with the involution @xmath67 coming from the clifford group .",
    "an analysis of this group of symmetries leads directly to `` _ une configuration trs - remarquable _ '' originally discovered by segre @xcite .",
    "we will present it using some notational improvements that were invented later @xcite .",
    "since @xmath68 is odd , the integer @xmath69 serves as the multiplicative inverse of @xmath70 among the integers modulo @xmath0 .",
    "it is then convenient to write the heisenberg group elements as    @xmath71    let us also introduce explicit matrix representations of the group generators :    @xmath72    note that the spectrum of the involution @xmath22 consists of @xmath69 eigenvalues @xmath73 and @xmath74 eigenvalues @xmath75 .",
    "hence @xmath22 splits the vector space into the direct sum    @xmath76    it is these subspaces that we should watch .",
    "in fact there are altogether @xmath5 subspaces of dimension @xmath69 singled out in this way , because there are @xmath5 involutions    @xmath77    the eigenvectors of the various cyclic subgroups can be collected into the @xmath1 mub    @xmath78    here @xmath79 labels the basis , @xmath80 the vectors , and @xmath81 their components . for @xmath20",
    "this coincides with form ( [ mub3 ] ) given earlier .",
    "note that @xmath82 mub have been written as circulant matrices , which is a convenient thing to do .",
    "the key observation is that the zeroth columns in the mub all obey  we suppress the index labelling components    @xmath83    hence this set of @xmath1 vectors belongs to the @xmath69-dimensional subspace @xmath84 defined by the involution @xmath22 .",
    "we can go on to show that each of the @xmath69-dimensional eigenspaces defined by the @xmath5 involutions @xmath85 contain @xmath1 mub vectors .",
    "conversely , each mub vector belongs to @xmath0 subspaces .",
    "we have found the segre configuration    @xmath86    containing @xmath87 points and @xmath5 @xmath88-planes in projective @xmath30-space , always assuming that @xmath0 is an odd prime .",
    "the intersection properties of the segre configuration are remarkable .",
    "two @xmath69-spaces in @xmath89 dimensions intersect at least in a single ray . with a total of @xmath5 such subspaces to play with we expect many vectors to arise in this way . but let @xmath90 be such a vector .",
    "a minor calculation shows that    @xmath91    thus @xmath90 must be an eigenvector of some element in the heisenberg group , and hence the intersection of any two @xmath69-spaces is always one of the @xmath92 eigenvectors in the configuration . in the other direction things",
    "are a little more complicated .",
    "two vectors belonging to the same basis are never members of same eigenspace , while two vectors of two different mub belong to a unique common eigenspace . using projective duality",
    "we obtain the dual configuration    @xmath93    consisting of @xmath5 @xmath88-spaces and @xmath87 hyperplanes .",
    "the intersection properties are precisely those of a finite affine plane @xcite .",
    "these are the facts that so delighted segre .",
    "a hundred years later they delighted wootters @xcite  although he phrased the discussion directly in terms of the phase point operators @xmath85 rather than in terms of their eigenspaces .",
    "a systematic study of prime power dimensions in segre s spirit appears not to have been made , although there are some results for @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "but where is the sic ? it is hard to tell .",
    "when the dimension @xmath95 we observe that @xmath96 , so the dual segre configuration involves @xmath5 vectors , and these are precisely the sic vectors ( [ points ] ) . when @xmath97 the segre configuration contains not even a candidate set of @xmath5 vectors .",
    "but at least , as a byproduct of the construction , we find a set of @xmath98 equiangular vectors in any @xmath69 dimensional hilbert space such that @xmath89 is an odd prime .",
    "explicitly they are    @xmath99 \\ .",
    "\\label{2n}\\ ] ]    such sets are of some interest in connection with pure state quantum tomography @xcite .    the elliptic curve itself has not been much in evidence in this section .",
    "it is still there in the background though , and in any dimension it contains @xmath5 distinguished @xmath0-torsion points .",
    "a study of the explicit expression for the heisenberg covariant elliptic curve shows that each of its torsion points belong to one of the @xmath5 eigenspaces @xmath100 @xcite , and with the single exception of the @xmath20 example ( [ points ] ) the known sics never sit in such a subspace , so the torsion points are not sics .",
    "this is discouraging , but we will find some consolation when we proceed to examine the @xmath24 case .",
    "in an @xmath24 dimensional hilbert space there is a parting of the ways , in the sense that the mub and the sic are defined using two different versions of the heisenberg group .",
    "the elliptic curve stays with @xmath101 . using an argument concerning line bundles and employing ingredients such as the riemann - roch theorem",
    ", it can be shown that an elliptic normal curve in projective 3-space ( not confined to any projective plane ) is the non - singular intersection of two quadratic polynomials .",
    "if we insist that it is transformed into itself by the heisenberg group in its clock and shift representation ( [ group ] ) , it follows @xcite that these quadratic polynomials are    @xmath102    the extra symmetry under the involution @xmath22 , defined in ( [ a ] ) , again appears automatically .",
    "we can diagonalise these quadratic forms by means of a unitary transformation of our hilbert space . in the new coordinates we have    @xmath103    note that @xmath104 implies",
    "@xmath105    hence the elliptic curve lies on a quartic surface .    the new basis that we have introduced has a natural interpretation in terms of the involution @xmath22 .",
    "first of all , by acting on @xmath22 with the heisenberg group as in eq .",
    "( [ aij ] ) we obtain only four involutions altogether , rather than @xmath5 as in the odd prime case .",
    "their spectra are @xmath106 , and in the new basis they are all represented by diagonal matrices .",
    "hence each basis vector is inverted by one involution , and left invariant by the others . in projective 3-space",
    "they correspond to four reference points , and one can show that the 16 tangents of the 16 torsion points on the curve divide into 4 sets of 4 each coming together at one of the 4 reference points @xcite .",
    "each such set is an orbit under the subgroup of elements of order 2 .    in our preferred basis",
    "the generators of the heisenberg group appear in the form    @xmath107    finding a set of 16 sic - vectors covariant under the heisenberg group is now a matter of simple guesswork .",

    "the whole set is organised into 4 groups , where each group sits at a standard distance from the 4 basis vectors that are naturally singled out by the elliptic curve .",
    "the normalised vectors obey eq .",
    "( [ mus ] ) for a minimum uncertainty state , even though our basis is unusual .",

    "when we project them to the subspace orthogonal to the first basis vector we have 4 equiangular vectors in a 3 dimensional subspace .",
    "each projected vector will be invariant under a rotation of order 3 belonging to the symmetry group of this tetrahedron .",
    "an example leaving the first vector invariant is    @xmath112    it is straightforward to check that the rotation @xmath113 belongs to the clifford group , and is indeed identical to one of `` zauner s unitaries '' @xcite .",
    "each of the four involutions @xmath22 admit a `` square root '' belonging to the clifford group , such as    @xmath114    acting with these unitaries on the sic ( [ sic4 ] ) will give a set of altogether 16 different sics , collectively forming an orbit under the clifford group @xcite .",
    "note that the 16 sic points in projective space do not actually sit on the elliptic curve . in this sense",
    "the step from @xmath20 to @xmath24 is non - trivial . in an arbitrary even dimension",
    "@xmath115 the involution @xmath22 , see ( [ a ] ) , has a spectrum consisting of @xmath116 eigenvalues @xmath73 and @xmath74 eigenvalues @xmath75 . when @xmath24 this singles out a unique ray but in higher dimensions this is not so , so generalising to arbitrary even dimension will not be easy",
    "eddington and his surface have not yet appeared .",
    "the group on whose twofold cover his fundamental theory hinged was not the heisenberg group over the ring of integers modulo 4 , but a different heisenberg group of the form @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "this group can be represented by real matrices , and is in fact the group which gives rise to the complete set of mub in 4 dimensions .",
    "what can we do with it ?",
    "there does not exist a sic which is covariant under eddington s group .",
    "in fact the group @xmath118 admits such an orbit only if @xmath119 or @xmath120 @xcite . as a substitute we can look for an orbit of 16 minimum uncertainty states with respect to the maximal set of mub .",

    "although this is not a sic , in a way it comes close to being one . like the sics ( [ points ] ) and ( [ sic4 ] ) , it can be arrived at using the following procedure : introduce a vector @xmath123 , and adjust the value of @xmath124 so that the normalised vector solves eq .",
    "( [ mus ] ) for a minimum uncertainty state . next introduce a complex hadamard matrix , that is to say a unitary matrix all of whose matrix elements have the same modulus .",

    "next permute the entries of the original vector cyclically , and afterwards try to adjust the phases @xmath126 so that the resulting @xmath0 vectors are again equiangular with the mutual scalar products characterising a sic . extending the new vectors using an hadamard matrix in the same way as before then gives @xmath0 equiangular vectors each of which belongs to a separate group of @xmath0 equiangular vectors . before we can say that we have constructed a sic we must check that all scalar products between pairs of vectors not belonging to the same group take the sic values .",
    "the vectors ( [ edd ] ) fail to form a sic only because the last step fails .",
    "finally we come back to eddington s lecture room . in the treatise that he read @xcite it is explained that an orbit of @xmath117 gives a realisation of the kummer configuration @xmath127 , consisting of 16 points and 16 planes in projective 3-space , such that each point belongs to 6 planes and each plane contains 6 points .",
    "the above set of minimum uncertainty states realises this configuration .",
    "as an example , the 6 vectors    @xmath128\\ ] ]    are orthogonal to the row vector    @xmath129    or in other words the corresponding 6 points belong to the corresponding plane .",
    "this is a purely group theoretical property and does not require the vectors to be minimum uncertainty states . still , eddington s story suggests that our 16 special vectors may have some use , somewhere .",
