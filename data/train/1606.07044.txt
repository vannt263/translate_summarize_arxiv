    "expressions are now derived for calculating the induced current within an arbitrary number of circular lenz lenses made from wires and placed within the incident magnetic field generated by an external rf coil .",
    "note that , by the theory of reciprocity @xcite , the expressions may be used in an equivalent sense to describe a situation in which a distinct volume of precessing magnetisation induces current within the lenz lenses , which in turn induce current within the external rf coil .",

    "equating the potential in equation  ( [ voltage ] ) to the emf in equation  ( [ faraday ] ) ( combined with equation  ( [ phib ] ) ) and assuming a time - harmonic regime , we obtain the following expression for the induced current within the lens : @xmath37},\\label{il1}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the operating frequency ( radians / s ) of the rf coil . equation  ( [ il1 ] ) represents a generalisation of an expression provided by schoenmaker et al .",

    "those authors ignored the resistance term in equation  ( [ il1 ] ) , hence neglecting the frequency dependence of the induced current , and they also ignored the mutual inductance between the inner and outer loops of the lens .    for high - frequency applications , such as the megahertz regime relevant to nmr",

    "a common alternative is to approximate the relative increase in resistance by the inverse of the relative decrease in the effective cross - sectional area of the ring defined by the skin - depth @xcite .",
    "this approach is accurate to within 5.5% of the exact result when the ratio of wire radius , @xmath41 , to skin - depth , @xmath42 , is greater than one @xcite , and below this limit the resistance is simply equal to @xmath39 : @xmath43 where @xmath44/(\\pi a^{2})$ ] , in which @xmath45 is the radius of the outer loop of the lens and @xmath46 is the radius of the inner loop , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the resistivity and permeability of the conductor , respectively ( e.g. for copper @xmath50 @xmath51 m and @xmath52 h / m ) .",

    "@xmath56 is the high - frequency limit for which current is restricted to the surface of the wire and @xmath57 is the low - frequency limit for which the current is uniform throughout the wire ; hence we set @xmath58 ( see equation  ( [ rac ] ) ) .",

    "the mutual inductances between the helmholtz coil and the elements of the lenz lens , and between the lens elements themselves , can be calculated using the formulae provided by babic et al .",

    "we must now treat the two loops of the helmholtz pair separately ( subscripts @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) and consider also the mutual inductances that exist between the elements of different lenses .",

    "as an illustrative example , equation  ( [ ilm ] ) was solved for several different arrangements appropriate to the experiments described in section [ sec : expts ] .",

    "was fixed at @xmath74 mm for all cases .",
    "the radius of the inner loop of the lens(es ) , @xmath46 , was set at either 0.1 mm or 0.2 mm and we considered both single lens and double lens cases , with a lens separation for the latter of either 0.1 mm or 0.2 mm .",
    "all simulations were performed using matlab^^ ( r2012b , mathworks^^ ) .    in general , a smaller radius for the inner loop of a lens results in a stronger magnetic field at the midpoint .",
    "however , in nmr ( or mri ) it is desirable not only to have a strong transmit rf field ( and correspondingly high receive sensitivity ) but also to have a homogeneous field , such that the flip angle is constant throughout the region of interest ( roi ) .",
    "therefore the design of the lenz lens(es ) for nmr becomes an optimisation problem with the goal of maximising the induced field within the roi , with respect to the lens geometry , while maintaining an acceptable level of homogeneity .",

    ", the roi was chosen to be a cylindrical volume of radius 0.06 mm and height 0.06 mm , centred at the origin and coaxial with the lenses and helmholtz coil .",
    "the mean terms in equation  ( [ opt ] ) were evaluated by integrating numerically ( trapezoidal rule ) over the roi and then dividing by the volume .",
    "the optimisation in equation  ( [ opt ] ) was achieved using the function ` fmincon ` from the matlab^^ optimisation toolbox(interior - point algorithm ) for three cases : one , two and four lenses . to improve convergence for the cases with multiple lenses ,",
    "the optimisation was performed in two stages : firstly , the axial placements of the lenses were fixed at equal increments between the helmholtz coils and equation  ( [ opt ] ) was solved with respect to the lens radii alone ; secondly , the results from the first optimisation were used as the starting guess for the full optimisation of equation  ( [ opt ] ) .",
    "additional constraints were imposed to ensure that : the inner loops were always smaller than the outer loops ; the axial placements of multiple lenses were always separated by at least the wire diameter ; the axial placements of pairs of multiple lenses were always symmetric about @xmath78 and closer to the origin than the helmholtz coils ; the radii of the outer loops were always less than twice that of the helmholtz coil ( and all radii were positive ) .",

    "[ fig : spacing ] , the -pulse was defined at the centre - point , and for the case with spacing the array size used in the calculation was reduced to points .",
    "fig .  [ simfigs ] demonstrates that the magnitude and homogeneity of the focused field is strongly dependent on the number and geometrical parameters of the lenz lenses . for a single lens , a smaller inner loop results in a stronger field at the cost of homogeneity .",
    "however , with the introduction of a second lens this homogeneity can be partially recovered , provided that an appropriate axial separation is chosen . for example , those pairs of lenses in fig .",
    "[ simfigs ] for which the ratio of the inner loop radius to the axial separation is equal to one ( i.e. akin to the helmholtz pair ; column 1 , row 3 and column 2 , row 4 ) clearly display a superior trade - off of amplification to homogeneity , over a spherical roi , compared to the other arrangements .",
    "however , to obtain the best trade - off over an arbitrarily shaped roi , especially when considering additional lenses , optimisation via equation  ( [ opt ] ) is necessary .",
    "[ optfigs ] demonstrates that for an average relative field error of 1% within the roi defined in section  [ ssec : meth_simopt ] , it is possible to achieve amplifications of 1.5 , 2.2 and 3.0 with one , two and four lenses , respectively , over the use of a helmholtz pair alone .",
    "if the field constraint is relaxed to 2% error , the amplification increases to 1.7 , 2.5 and 3.2 , respectively ( data not shown ) . notice that for the case of four lenses in fig .",
    "[ optfigs ] , the inner loops lie approximately on the surface of a sphere . however , for the equivalent case with 2% error , the two pairs of lenses are brought into close proximity to one another ( not shown ) .",
    "equations  ( [ ilm])-([opt ] ) therefore allow the study and design of a wide variety of lens arrangements with flexible field constraints .",
    "indeed they may be applied to circular lenses of any orientation without necessarily being restricted to the centred coaxial arrangements considered herein .",
    "furthermore , the choice of considering a helmholtz pair as the transmit / receive rf coil has been made for demonstrative purposes only , since it was also used in some of the experiments , and the theory is applicable to any system for which the mutual inductance can be calculated .",
    "note that we have ignored capacitive effects that may be present for multiple closely - spaced lenses and also the finite gap between the elements that join the inner and outer loops . both of these factors will reduce the achievable amplification by some degree .",
    "note also that a direct method was used to solve equation  ( [ opt ] ) , which was somewhat sensitive to the initial guess and hence the two - stage procedure described in section  [ ssec : meth_simopt ] was implemented .",
    "an alternative approach would be to use stochastic optimisation , such as simulated annealing , to guarantee convergence to the global optimum at the cost of runtime .",
    "the experiments performed in this study clearly confirm the focusing effect and the associated local snr enhancement as predicted by the model .",
    "for the designs fabricated in this study , we achieved enhancements @xmath112 ( table  [ tab : table2 ] ) .",
    "for the largest enhancement @xmath113 , the power required to generate a -pulse was reduced by a factor of compared to the reference .",
    "although in this case the observable volume of interest was reduced to of the initial volume , the gain in snr corresponds to a @xmath114-fold decrease in acquisition time , since @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "higher snrs were achieved for the plate - based designs due to the lower electrical resistance , i.e. , the increased noise contribution in the case of the wire - based design .",
    "mean snr enhancement may be estimated using the derived probe efficiencies @xmath96 , which are based on the -pulse power @xmath94 , and these were found to correspond well with the measured effective probe efficiencies @xmath104 ( table  [ tab : table2 ] ) .    a trade - off between the enhancement and the homogeneity of the snr profile was clearly apparent in the experimental results .",
    "for example , for ll4 at @xmath116 we observed an enhancement of @xmath117 and a standard deviation ( std ) of , whereas at @xmath118 the std improved by to at the cost of a decrease in the enhancement to @xmath119 ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : ll4 ] ) . in the latter case , @xmath84 approached at the centre - point and exceeded at the peak field positions , which occurred close to the inner edge of the lenz lens defined by the inner diameter , and this resulted in a reduced snr at these points .",

    "<S> a high nmr detection sensitivity is indispensable when dealing with mass and volume - limited samples , or whenever a high spatial resolution is required . </S>",
    "<S> the use of miniaturised rf coils is a proven way to increase sensitivity , but may be impractical and is not applicable to every experimental situation . </S>",
    "<S> we present the use of magnetic lenses , denoted as lenz lenses due to their working principle , to focus the magnetic flux of a macroscopic rf coil into a smaller volume and thereby locally enhance the sensitivity of the nmr experiment  at the expense of the total sensitive volume . besides focusing , such lenses facilitate re - guiding or re - shaping of magnetic fields much like optical lenses do with light beams . for the first time we experimentally demonstrate the use of lenz lenses in magnetic resonance and provide a compact mathematical description of the working principle . through simulations we show that optimal arrangements can be found .    n.s . </S>",
    "<S> and p.t.w contributed equally to this work . ]    both nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) suffer from an inherently low sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> the signal strength is primarily determined by the equilibrium boltzmann distribution , with energy levels of the spin states just slightly above the thermal energy . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the limit of detection ( lod ) is up to ten orders of magnitude worse compared to other analytical techniques @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . this fact severely limits the lowest detectable quantity in nmr spectroscopy and the highest achievable spatial resolution in mri , both being directly proportional to the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the snr , first derived by hoult and richards @xcite , is given by @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a scaling factor to account for the homogeneity of the radio - frequency ( rf ) coil employed , @xmath2 is the rf - coil s magnetic field strength , @xmath3 the unit current , @xmath4 the coil s sensitivity , @xmath5 the observed sample volume , @xmath6 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath7 is the temperature , @xmath8 the spin density , @xmath9 the spin quantum number , @xmath10 is planck s constant @xmath11 divided by @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the larmor frequency determined by the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath14 of the nucleus of interest and the strength of the static magnetic field @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the electrical resistance of the coil contributing thermal noise , @xmath17 is the bandwidth of the receiver , and @xmath18 the power .    the search for higher snr has resulted in steadily increasing @xmath15-field strengths , currently reaching a maximum of around ( @xmath19h larmor frequency ) for commercially available nmr systems , while field strengths of human scale mri magnets typically do not exceed in the clinic . </S>",
    "<S> while both the noise level and the boltzmann distribution would benefit from a reduced sample temperature , the freezing point and the operating temperature of the sample impose practical limits . </S>",
    "<S> non - equilibrium boltzmann polarisation factors can also be reached through spin order transfer techniques such as dynamic nuclear polarisation ( dnp ) or parahydrogen induced polarisation ( phip ) , which , however , often involve toxic substances and hence are not yet generally compatible with living biological samples .    </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the snr is maximised by using optimised hardware along the receive path , such as dedicated rf receiver coils . </S>",
    "<S> such coil designs follow two strategies : ( i )  the filling factor @xcite and hence the magnetic interaction is maximised when the coil geometrically conforms to the sample as closely as possible , and ( ii )  the sensitivity increases linearly as the diameter of the coil decreases for a constant height - to - diameter ratio @xcite . the relative intrinsic snr is therefore higher when using a smaller , sample - adapted coil . hence such coils are used when recording mr images of body parts , e.g. , the brain , or when acquiring spectra from rare or volume - limited substances @xcite . however , additional equipment is required to cover the various cases , which is cost - intensive and requires maintenance , while situations remain where it is not yet possible to place the sample inside a dedicated active coil , such as when studying inner parts like organs .    to circumvent these issues , </S>",
    "<S> we introduce here a method to locally improve the sensitivity of the nmr ( or mri ) experiment by means of broadband passive magnetic lenses . the working principle behind these lenses </S>",
    "<S> is geometry based and governed by lenz law , and hence they are referred to as lenz lenses @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such lenses are capable of focusing the magnetic field of a macroscopic rf coil into a smaller spatial region , thereby locally increasing the flux density for the same applied radiofrequency current . </S>",
    "<S> lenz lenses can be simply made from wire , or conductive sheets such as copper foil , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ll - overview ] , which illustrates two basic shapes .    </S>",
    "<S> -2.5cm0 in   from the outer edge to the inner edge , while reversing the flow direction , as further depicted in ( e ) , where two lenses are arranged in parallel in a helmholtz pair like configuration , denoted as a double lenz lens configuration.,title=\"fig : \" ]    due to their simple geometry and wireless , broadband inductive coupling , lenz lenses can easily be tailored to the intended application in a much more flexible manner than rf resonators , and are straightforward to fabricate . </S>",
    "<S> multiple lenses can be combined to enable the shaping or rotating of the magnetic field , similar to lenses in optics , and hence introduce a whole new degree of flexibility for the mr analysis of diverse samples . </S>"
