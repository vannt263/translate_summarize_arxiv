    "the goal of the _ degree  diameter problem _ is to determine the largest possible order of a graph or digraph , perhaps restricted to some special class , with given maximum ( out)degree and diameter . for an overview of progress on a wide variety of approaches to this problem ,",
    "see the survey by miller & ir  @xcite .",
    "our concern here is with large _ cayley _ graphs and digraphs .",
    "recall that , for a group @xmath3 and a unit - free subset @xmath4 of @xmath3 , the _ cayley digraph _ of @xmath3 generated by @xmath4 has vertex set @xmath3 and a directed edge from @xmath5 to @xmath6 for all @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath4 is symmetric , i.e. @xmath9 , then the corresponding undirected simple graph is the _ cayley graph _ of @xmath3 generated by @xmath4 .",
    "the cayley ( di)graph is thus regular of ( out)degree @xmath10 .",
    "we are interested in graphs and digraphs of degree  @xmath1 and diameter @xmath0 , for arbitrary large @xmath0 and varying @xmath1 .",
    "if a construction yields graphs of order @xmath11 , we say that it has _",
    "asymptotic order _",
    "@xmath12 if @xmath13 \\liminfty[d ] \\frac{n_{d , k}}{f(d , k ) } \\;=\\ ; 1 .\\ ] ] no graph or digraph can be larger than the corresponding _ moore bound _ , which in both cases has asymptotic order @xmath14 .    previously , for arbitrary degree and diameter , the largest known cayley graphs were obtained by macbeth , iagiov , ir & vetrk  @xcite , whose construction has asymptotic order @xmath15 .",
    "we construct cayley graphs whose order is asymptotically @xmath16 . for given diameter  @xmath0 , these graphs are larger than those in  @xcite for every value of @xmath1 in a large interval . we also construct , for given @xmath0 and infinitely many values of @xmath1 , cayley graphs whose asymptotic order is @xmath17 , a factor of @xmath18 larger than those of macbeth , iagiov , ir & vetrk .",
    "the directed case is similar .",
    "previously , the largest known cayley digraphs were obtained by vetrk  @xcite , whose construction has asymptotic order @xmath19 .",
    "we construct cayley digraphs whose order is asymptotically @xmath20 . for given diameter @xmath0 ,",
    "these digraphs are larger than those in  @xcite for every value of @xmath1 in a large interval .",
    "we also construct , for given @xmath0 and infinitely many values of @xmath1 , cayley digraphs whose asymptotic order is @xmath21 , a factor of @xmath22 larger than those of vetrk and within a polynomial factor of the moore bound .",
    "our constructions are motivated by the _ de  bruijn graphs_. for given @xmath23 , the de  bruijn graph has as its vertex set every vector in @xmath24 .",
    "two distinct vertices @xmath25 and @xmath26 are joined by an edge if @xmath27 or @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "clearly , this graph has order  @xmath30 , maximum degree @xmath31 , and diameter @xmath32 , yielding for any degree @xmath1 and diameter @xmath0 , a graph of order  @xmath33 .",
    "orienting each edge appropriately results in a digraph with diameter @xmath32 and maximum outdegree @xmath34 , yielding for any degree @xmath1 and diameter @xmath0 , a digraph of order  @xmath14 .",
    "in general , de  bruijn graphs are not cayley graphs .",
    "however , traversing an edge in a de  bruijn graph corresponds to the action of some kind of left or right shift operation on the vertex vectors .",
    "inspired by this observation , we construct a group , @xmath3 , of order @xmath35 as follows .",
    "this group is used to create all our cayley graphs and digraphs .",
    "let @xmath36 be the automorphism of @xmath24 that cyclically shifts coordinates rightwards by one .",
    "in other words , @xmath37 . given @xmath23 ,",
    "let @xmath38 be the wreath product of @xmath24 and @xmath39 .",
    "each element of @xmath3 is an ordered pair @xmath40 , whose first component is a vector from @xmath24 , and whose second component is an element of @xmath39 .",
    "the group operation is defined by @xmath41 , or equivalently , @xmath42 thus , the element @xmath43 of @xmath3 acts as a cyclic shift to the right by @xmath44 , followed by addition of the vector @xmath45 . in particular , elements of the form @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and their inverses @xmath48 , correspond to edges in the de  bruijn graph .",
    "cayley graphs and digraphs of this group were used previously by macbeth , iagiov , ir & vetrk  @xcite and vetrk  @xcite respectively in the constructions mentioned above , though in neither case is the connection to the de  bruijn graphs made explicit .",
    "each of our results is a consequence of choosing an appropriate set of generators for @xmath3 .",
    "we make use of two distinct constructions .",
    "we present the directed case first , since it is slightly simpler .",
    "let @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the order of @xmath3 is @xmath51    as generators for the cayley digraph we use the @xmath34 _ shift and add _",
    "elements @xmath46 , for @xmath52 , which correspond to edges in the de  bruijn graph , together with the remaining @xmath53 nonzero _ cyclic shift _ elements @xmath54 , for @xmath55 .",
    "thus the digraph has outdegree @xmath56 .",
    "clearly , it also has diameter @xmath57 since every element is the product of @xmath32 de  bruijn shift and add operations ( establishing the vector ) and a single cyclic shift ( to establish the final shift value ) .",
    "vetrk  @xcite presents , for any @xmath2 and @xmath58 , a family of cayley digraphs of diameter  @xmath0 , degree  @xmath1 , and order @xmath59 .",
    "his constructions use the group @xmath3 , with a different generating set .",
    "clearly , for large enough @xmath1 , vetrk s digraphs are bigger than those of theorem  [ thm1stdir ] . however , for any given diameter @xmath60 , it can be confirmed ( using a computer algebra system , or otherwise ) that asymptotically the digraphs of theorem  [ thm1stdir ] are larger than those of vetrk if @xmath61    for the undirected case , we simply add elements to the generating set to make it symmetric .",
    "let @xmath49 and @xmath62 .",
    "as generators for the cayley graph of @xmath3 we use the @xmath34 elements @xmath46 , along with their inverses @xmath48 , and the remaining @xmath63 nonzero elements @xmath54 for @xmath64 .",
    "thus the graph has degree @xmath65 . as in the directed case , it has diameter @xmath57 .",
    "macbeth , iagiov , ir & vetrk  @xcite present , for any @xmath66 and @xmath67 , a family of cayley graphs with diameter @xmath0 , degree at most @xmath1 , and order @xmath68 .. ] their constructions also use the group @xmath3 , with a different generating set . for large enough @xmath1 , these graphs are bigger than those of theorem  [ thm1stundir ] .",
    "however , for any given diameter @xmath60 , it can be confirmed that asymptotically the graphs of theorem  [ thm1stundir ] are larger than those of macbeth , iagiov , ir & vetrk if @xmath69",
    "in our second construction , we conceive of the `` de  bruijn '' vectors of length @xmath32 as being partitioned into @xmath70 _ long _ blocks , each of length @xmath71 , and a single _ short _ block , of length @xmath72 .",
    "the order of @xmath3 is @xmath35 . as generators for the cayley digraph",
    ", we use the @xmath73 _ long _ elements @xmath74 , @xmath75 , together with the additional @xmath76 nonzero _ short _ elements @xmath77 , @xmath75 , @xmath78 .",
    "thus the digraph has outdegree @xmath79 .",
    "long elements shift by @xmath71 and modify a long block ; short elements shift arbitrarily and modify a short block .",
    "the digraph has diameter @xmath0 since every element is the product of a single short element ( establishing @xmath72 components of the vector and guaranteeing the final shift value ) and @xmath70 long elements ( establishing the remaining @xmath80 components of the vector )",
    ".    given @xmath0 , @xmath71 and @xmath34 , for judicious choice of @xmath72 , these digraphs are larger than those of vetrk  @xcite . specifically , asymptotically they are at least a factor of @xmath34 larger if @xmath81      we use the construction of theorem  [ thm2nddirconstruct ] .",
