    "ab initio _ electronic structure calculations have become a primary tool of research for understanding the microscopic behavior of solids .",
    "the multitude of methods that have emerged to deal with periodic crystal systems , such as density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite , rely on the bloch theorem@xcite in one form or the other .",
    "the bloch theorem builds upon the translational symmetry of the crystal lattice and paves the way to the fundamental concepts needed to understand the electronic structure of periodic systems , such as the classification of the electronic states in terms of wavevectors @xmath0 and the notion of bandstructure .",
    "many important properties of the crystal , such as magnetic or transport properties , are encoded in the bandstructure .",
    "in addition , the bandstructure is important for the interpretation of a few experimental measurements like angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes )",
    ".    however , a problem arises in the practical use of dft calculations whenever we have to deal with systems where the original translational symmetry is broken .",
    "these situations are encountered , for example , in calculations on doped materials or in magnetically ordered systems .",
    "often , in these situations we have to employ large supercells whose size determines the periodicity of the bandstructure through the bloch theorem .",
    "this results in a complicated bandstructure consisting of many bands , which is hard to interpret .",
    "recently , a number of methods have emerged @xcite to alleviate this problem .",
    "a common approach shared among these methods , implicitly or explicitly , is a transformation from one bloch basis to another .",
    "an important aspect of the bloch theorem is that it is an expression of one of the fundamental group - theoretical principles , which states that the eigenstates of a physical system can be classified according to the irreducible representations of its group of symmetries  @xcite . in light of this",
    ", the bandstructure unfolding can be viewed as a transformation between the irreducible representations of different translation groups . despite the number of recent publications  @xcite , a rigorous consideration of the group - theoretical aspects of the bandstructure unfolding is still missing and as a consequence certain important properties",
    "are overseen , especially in relation to arpes experiments .",
    "the purpose of this work is to attempt to close this conceptual gap by introducing a bandstructure unfolding based on group theory .",
    "this treatment allows us to incorporate point group symmetries into a unified framework and generalizes the idea of using glide - mirror operations , initially proposed in the context of lafeaso  @xcite , in order to obtain models of reduced dimensionality .",
    "our bandstructure unfolding also allows for a clear understanding of the two - fe versus one - fe description of the electronic properties of fe - based superconductors .    we will show that bandstructure unfolding can be achieved by projecting the bands onto the induced irreducible representations of the supergroup of the initial group of translations .",
    "we will also show that this leads naturally to the concept of the unfolded brillouin zone . with the help of the point group operations",
    ", bandstructures can be unfolded beyond the limits of translational symmetry .",
    "further , tight - binding models with reduced number of orbitals can be formulated under certain conditions .",
    "the group - theoretical formulation of the unfolding procedure in terms of projections onto the irreducible subspaces allows us to unfold any quantity in the reciprocal space if we know how it behaves under the symmetry operations of the crystal lattice .",
    "in addition , the unfolding artifacts such as `` ghost - bands '' @xcite or `` incomplete bands '' @xcite are naturally explained as bands with projections onto the multiple irreducible subspaces in cases with broken symmetry .",
    "one of the fundamental statements in solid state physics is that the eigenstates of the hamiltonian of a periodic system can be classified according to the irreducible representations of the group of translational symmetries of the system .",
    "let us denote the crystal lattice as , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 is the number of unit cells in the lattice , @xmath3 are their position vectors , and @xmath4 are the vectors spanning the unit cell .",
    "the lattice is invariant under the action of the group of translation operators @xmath5 , such that @xmath6 , where periodic boundary conditions @xmath7 are assumed .",

    "its irreducible representations are one - dimensional and given by @xmath10 .",

    "we assume that we have @xmath22 localized electronic states , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , centered at positions @xmath25 , occupying the unit cell located at origin @xmath26 .",
    "the sites @xmath25 do nt necessarily have to be different since we can consider cases with multiple orbitals per atomic site .",
    "the translationally invariant electronic states of the crystal lattice are obtained by the action of @xmath8 onto these states , and the resulting localized electronic states are @xmath27 at positions @xmath28 .",
    "application of the projector to the states @xmath23 results in the familiar bloch - states @xmath29 using as a basis , the hamiltonian @xmath21 is brought to the block - diagonal form , with @xmath11 blocks of size @xmath30 , whose elements are given by @xmath31_{\\mu\\nu } = { \\bra{{{{\\bm k}}},\\mu}}{{\\hat{h}}}{\\ket{{{{\\bm k}}},\\nu}}$ ] .",
    "every block @xmath32 can be diagonalized separately , yielding a set of @xmath22 bands at @xmath0 .",
    "a set of bands for every @xmath12 represents the bandstructure for the given lattice @xmath33 .      in many applications",
    ", the translation group @xmath8 can be expanded with a certain number of operations , which are , approximately , symmetry operations of the lattice @xmath33 .",
    "when this is the case , we will have a new group @xmath34 , such that @xmath8 is an invariant subgroup of @xmath34 , denoted @xmath35 .",
    "owing to this fact , irreducible representations of @xmath34 can be induced from @xmath8 in a simple manner .",
    "furthermore , addition of every new symmetry operation will halve the number of independent states @xmath36 at every @xmath0 , since additional operations will produce one half of the states @xmath36 from another half , and thus will halve the number of bands , producing the _ unfolded _ bandstructure .",
    "this is subject to certain conditions which will be outlined in the discussion that follows .",
    "let us assume now that we are expanding @xmath8 with @xmath37 operations @xmath38 , denoted in seitz notation  @xcite as @xmath39 , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a point group operation and @xmath42 is a fractional translation ( with respect to the translations @xmath43 of @xmath8 ) so that the combination of @xmath38 and @xmath43 leads to a space group @xmath34 .",
    "operations @xmath38 are allowed to be pure translations but not pure point group operations , since in the case of the pure point group operations , we would not be able to interpret the unfolded bandstructure in terms of a lattice of reduced periodicity .",

    "their matrix elements can be written as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the kronecker delta and sites @xmath53 and @xmath54 are considered equal if they differ by a lattice vector . the total action of @xmath45 is @xmath55 the task is now to induce the irreducible representations of the space group @xmath34 .",
    "we first note that the operators @xmath38 are the right coset representatives of @xmath34 with respect to @xmath8 .",
    "let the factor group , corresponding to this right coset decomposition be @xmath56 .",
    "the well known property of space groups is that every space group is solvable , that is , every space group can be decomposed into a series @xmath57 , where every factor group in the decomposition is abelian .",
    "in addition to that , it is always possible to find the decomposition series where the factor groups @xmath58 are cyclic groups of index two or three .",
    "this simplifies the induction procedure further , since in case the factor group @xmath59 is not a cyclic group , we can always decompose it into a subgroup series @xmath60 , where every @xmath61 is a cyclic group .     and @xmath62 of @xmath34 .",
    "( b ) the unfolded bandstructure shows that @xmath63 , leading to the unfolded brillouin zone , shown in yellow and purple backgrounds . the folding vector @xmath64 is shown in green color . ]    in the induction procedure , from every irreducible representation of @xmath8 , multiple irreducible representations of @xmath34 can be induced",
    ". some of these irreducible representations will be one - dimensional , while some will be multi - dimensional . the multi - dimensional induced irreducible representations of @xmath34 will mix irreducible representations of @xmath8 with different @xmath0 . since our goal is to perform the unfolding within the same @xmath0 , we have to restrict ourselves only to the cases where the induction procedure yields one - dimensional irreducible representations of @xmath34 .",
    "for every irreducible representation @xmath16 of @xmath8 , irreducible representations of @xmath34 are determined from the little co - group @xmath65  @xcite .",
    "the little co - group is a group of all point group operations @xmath66 such that @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is a reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "given an irreducible representation @xmath69 of @xmath65 , an irreducible representation @xmath70 of @xmath34 is induced , where the coset representatives @xmath38 are represented by @xmath71 and the index @xmath72 runs over all irreducible representations .",
    "this holds across the entire interior of the bz , with the exception of the bz boundary for the cases of the symmorphic space groups , where the induction procedure is more complex , and more sophisticated methods , such as herring s method , are needed  @xcite .",
    "we will just assume that @xmath0 never lies on the bz boundary , but it can be arbitrarily close to it . in cases",
    "where @xmath73 , i.e. where the operators @xmath38 are just fractional translations , which is the case of translational unfolding , the little group @xmath65 will contain all fractional translations and will be the same for every @xmath0 . in this case , the irreducible representations of the little group @xmath69 , are taken to be the irreducible representations of the group of fractional translations , modulo @xmath8 , meaning that two fractional translations are considered to be identical if they differ by @xmath3 .    when @xmath0 is invariant ( up to the reciprocal lattice vector @xmath68 ) under all point group operators of @xmath59 , then from the irreducible representation @xmath16 of @xmath8 , @xmath37 one - dimensional irreducible representations @xmath70 will be induced .",
    "when this is the case , the @xmath74 will be roots of unity so that we can write , in general , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is an integer such that @xmath77 .",
    "the integers @xmath76 , with the operation of addition modulo @xmath37 , constitute a group isomorphic to @xmath65 .",
    "we use the convention that @xmath78 denotes the unit irreducible representation , thus @xmath79 .",

    ", @xmath32 can be brought into block - diagonal form with @xmath82 blocks @xmath83 of size @xmath84 .",
    "each block @xmath83 can be diagonalized separately and will yield @xmath85 bands .",
    "it is important to note that because of the addition of a fractional translation in eq .",
    ", the reciprocal space period of blocks @xmath83 is larger than the bz . since the only difference between the blocks @xmath83 is in the exponential prefactor @xmath86 in",
    ", we can restrict ourselves to only one block , i.e. @xmath83 , and then reproduce the other blocks , by allowing @xmath0 to leave the bz , because we can choose @xmath87 , such that @xmath88 where @xmath89 is an integer . in this way , we can have @xmath90 .",
    "the vectors @xmath91 are the _ folding _ vectors .",
    "the diagonalization of the block @xmath83 and its extensions outside of the bz , by the folding vectors , produces the _ unfolded _ bands .",
    "the bz , enlarged by the @xmath37 folding vectors @xmath91 is the unfolded bz ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bz_unfolding ] ) .",
    "it is important to stress here , that due to the fact that @xmath38 involve the fractional translations @xmath42 , and that due to the requirement of the one - dimensionality of the irreducible representations of @xmath34 , the unfolded bandstructure represents the bandstructure of the crystal lattice with the unit cell size reduced by a factor of @xmath37 , which can be simply translationally folded back along the folding vectors to represent the starting bandstructure , regardless of the point group operations @xmath41 .",
    "because of this , we can effectively describe the electronic structure with a hamiltonian of smaller dimensionality .",
    "we can also understand this in a different way .",
    "since @xmath92 are the symmetry adapted basis vectors , no interaction contained in the hamiltonian can cause a transition between the states with different @xmath72 , thereafter all dynamical processes are contained within their respective irreducible subspaces .",
    "we have seen that different irreducible representations become equivalent if shifted by the folding vectors , meaning that no information is lost if we just keep a single irreducible representation , as long as we expand it onto the entire unfolded brillouin zone .",
    "one more important issue to note is that our requirement for the one - dimensional irreducible representations of @xmath34 , implies that the unfolding which utilizes the point group operations is exact only for @xmath0 values which are invariant under all point group operations @xmath41 .",
    "for example , if we use the screw - axis operations , the unfolding will be exact only along a corresponding high - symmetry line in the brillouin zone .",
    "however , if the electronic properties are dominantly one dimensional along the given high - symmetry line , the unfolding can still be used across the entire brillouin zone , while preserving the accuracy up to a significant degree .    to unfold the bandstructure given in the bloch basis , we just need to calculate the matrix elements of the projectors @xmath93 .",
    "the matrix elements are given by @xmath94_{\\gamma\\delta } =     { \\bra{{{{\\bm k}}},\\gamma } } { { \\hat{p}}_{{{{\\bm k}}}\\alpha } } { \\ket{{{{\\bm k}}},\\delta } } \\\\=    \\frac{1}{k}\\sum_i    \\exp(2\\pi { \\mathrm{i}}\\alpha{f_i^\\alpha}/k )    \\exp({\\mathrm{i}}{{{\\bm k}}}\\cdot{{{{\\bm \\tau}}}_i})w_{\\gamma\\delta}({{{\\hat{c}}}_i})\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] if we assume that from the bandstructure calculations we obtain bands @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the band index , we can unfold the bands by applying the projectors to the column - vector containing the projections of bands onto the localized states @xmath97 . in our particular case , we have used the vienna ab - initio simulations package ( vasp ) to obtain the bandstructure . since , within the vasp package , the exponential factors @xmath98 for fractional site vector @xmath25 are already included in the projections @xmath99 , the exponential factors in eq .",
    "can be omitted , simplifying the expressions even further .",
    "in general , any observable @xmath100 can be unfolded by employing the projectors @xmath93 so that @xmath101 .    with the help of eq .",
    "it is also possible to unfold tight - binding models .",
    "the matrix elements of the hamiltonian in the tight - binding model are defined in the bloch basis eq .   as @xmath102_{\\mu\\nu } & =     { \\bra{{{{\\bm 0}},\\mu } } } { \\hat{h}}{{\\hat{p}}_{{{{\\bm k}}}}}{\\ket{{{{\\bm 0}},\\nu } } } \\\\ & =    \\sum_{{{{\\bm r}}_{{{{\\bm n } } } } } } t_{\\mu\\nu}({{{\\bm r}}_{{{{\\bm n}}}}})\\exp({\\mathrm{i}}{{{\\bm k}}}\\cdot{{{\\bm r}}_{{{{\\bm n } } } } } ) \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 are the hopping energies .",
    "this result follows from @xmath104 and the facts that @xmath21 commutes with @xmath105 and that @xmath105 is idempotent .",
    "we define the matrix composed of the hopping energies @xmath106 as @xmath107 .",
    "the unfolding of the tight - binding model is achieved by calculating the matrix elements of the hamiltonian in the basis eq .   and then casting the resulting expression in the form of eq .",
    "@xmath108_{\\mu\\nu } & =     { \\bra{{{{\\bm 0}},\\mu } } } { \\hat{h}}{{\\hat{p}}_{{{{\\bm k}}}\\alpha } } { \\ket{{{{\\bm 0}},\\nu } } } \\\\&=    \\sum_{{{{\\bm n}}}}\\sum_i    t_{\\mu\\nu}^\\alpha({{{\\bm r}}_{{{{\\bm n}}}}}+{{{{\\bm \\tau}}}_i } )    \\exp({\\mathrm{i}}{{{\\bm k}}}\\cdot({{{\\bm r}}_{{{{\\bm n}}}}}+{{{{\\bm \\tau}}}_i } ) ) \\end{split}\\ ] ] where the corresponding hopping energy matrix is @xmath109 .",
    "the hopping energies of the unfolded tb model can then be read off as coefficients of the exponential terms @xmath110 .",
    "the hopping energy matrices @xmath109 will have the same block - diagonal structure of @xmath83 . the general expression for the hopping energies",
    "is then @xmath111 it should be noted here that for @xmath112 , the unfolded hopping energies can become complex due to the prefactor @xmath113 .",
    "however , this prefactor does not affect the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath83 since it amounts to an overall , @xmath0-independent , unitary transformation of the hamiltonian .",
    "furthermore , in the unfolded picture , we extend a single irreducible representation beyond the bz boundaries , so that in the tight - binding model we expect to have a single set of hopping energies independent of the irreducible representation .",
    "this manifestly does not hold for eq .   since the exponential prefactor depends on @xmath72 .",
    "because of this , the exponential prefactor in eq",
    ".   can be dropped and the irreducible representation - independent unfolded hopping energies can be defined as @xmath114 when the unfolded hopping energies are defined in this way , the index @xmath72 can be omitted from eq .  .",
    "since we already concluded that the @xmath115 are block - diagonal , a reduction of the dimensionality of the tight - binding model is achieved .",
    "practically , this means that orbital indices @xmath116 and @xmath117 can be taken to run only over the first block in the block - diagonalized hamiltonian , since other blocks are symmetrically equivalent .",
    "angle resolved photoemission is one of the most direct ways to experimentally observe the bandstructure in solids  @xcite .",
    "however , the interpretation of raw experimental data is a very complicated process and often relies heavily on comparisons with density functional theory calculations .",
    "this becomes especially difficult in systems with broken translational symmetry , since , on the one hand , supercell calculations have to be employed by density functional theory resulting in complicated folded bandstructures , while on the other hand arpes data often shows the unfolded bandstructure , sometimes offset away from the first brillouin zone  @xcite .",
    "this was already discussed in the context of bandstructure unfolding  @xcite .",
    "however , some important issues were not considered , like the fact that multiple irreducible representations are involved in the unfolding as well as the effect of high symmetry elements of the brillouin zone .",
    "the observed photoelectron intensity at energy @xmath118 in arpes experiments can be directly related to the one - electron spectral function  @xcite @xmath119 where @xmath120 are the dipole matrix elements between the initial state @xmath121 and the final state @xmath122 and @xmath123 are the matrix elements of the one - electron spectral function . using the projectors from eq .",
    "this can be rewritten as @xmath124 where the trace is taken only over the final states and @xmath125 is restricted to the occupied subspace . if the observed system has approximate symmetry given by a group @xmath126 , either because ( i ) we have a slight breaking of the translational symmetry , or ( ii ) most of the contribution to the sum over @xmath0 in eq",
    ".   comes from the surface states lying in the high - symmetry element of the brillouin zone , we can extend the summation over @xmath0 onto the irreducible subspaces of @xmath34 so that we have @xmath127 since @xmath34 is an approximate symmetry , the off - diagonal blocks @xmath128 can be neglected .",
    "in addition , we can use the folding relations , eq .   to replace the summation over the irreducible representation index @xmath72 with the summation over the unfolded brillouin zone to obtain @xmath129 where @xmath130 , belong to the brillouin zone unfolded in accordance with eq .  . in this case , the arpes experiment will observe the spectral function @xmath131 instead of the spectral function @xmath132 .",
    "one important detail in eq .",
    "is the fact that the irreducible representation @xmath72 is only selected through the effect of dipole operators and the trace over the final states .",
    "this means , that the actual irreducible representation observed in the experiment depends on the experimental conditions .",
    "this is a very important conclusion , since it tells us that in order to carefully interpret raw arpes data , we have to take into account two considerations .",
    "the first one is the possible effect of high symmetry elements in the brillouin zone .",
    "this implies the incorporation of point group operations into the unfolding  we would like to stress here , that this issue is distinct from orbital symmetry selection by means of polarization .",
    "the second consideration is that we have to take into account all irreducible representations arising from the unfolding process and then use eq .   to reconstruct the bandstructure from the arpes data , if necessary",

    "the corresponding fractional translations are @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 , where @xmath135 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 are the unit vectors of the supercell , as shown in fig .",

    "despite the fact that the fractional translations @xmath42 are not the exact symmetries of ca(feas@xmath159p@xmath158)@xmath138 , the band projections onto different irreducible representations are still mostly orthogonal , having relatively clean unfolded bands as a result .",
    "this allows us to clearly see the disappearance of the hole pockets centered around @xmath157 , since the set of three hole @xmath167 bands is pushed below the fermi level by around 0.2  ev . comparison of the unfolded bands to the bandstructure of the collapsed tetragonal phase of cafe@xmath138as@xmath138 under pressure  @xcite confirms that phosphorus doping and application of hydrostatic pressure affect the structural and electronic properties of cafe@xmath138as@xmath138 in a remarkably similar way .",
    "we will now demonstrate the use of eq .",
    "and eq .   for the unfolding of tight - binding models .",
    "we consider as a test system fese at 10  gpa with significant dispersion in all three directions .",
    "the crystal structure has been obtained from ab - initio simulations of hydrostatic pressure at 10  gpa  @xcite .",
    "we have used the projective wannier functions as implemented in the fplo code  @xcite for the derivation of the 16-band tight - binding model which consists of five @xmath168 orbitals per iron site , and three @xmath169 orbitals per selenium site .",
    "the structure under 10  gpa of hydrostatic compression is chosen because the three dimensional character of the fermi surface is more pronounced compared to ambient pressure .",
    "as previously mentioned , the two translationally nonequivalent iron sites can be mapped onto each other with the help of the glide mirror operations @xmath170 with @xmath171 . the fractional translations @xmath42 connect the nearest neighbor iron atoms as shown in fig [ fig : fese_doubled_cellbz ] ( a ) , while @xmath172 is a reflection in the @xmath137-plane . to unfold we can choose one of the @xmath38 operations and then induce the irreducible representations of @xmath173 . in accordance with ref .",
    ", we call @xmath34 the glide - mirror group . since the factor group is of index two , two one - dimensional irreducible representations will be induced in the @xmath136 plane of the brillouin zone .",
    "because the electronic dispersion in fese is weaker along the @xmath174 axis , we can expect that irreducible representations induced in the @xmath136 plane will give adequate unfolding across the rest of the brillouin zone .",
    "in these two irreducible representations , the glide mirror operation will have the same representation as did the fractional translation in eq .  .",
    "however , what differentiates the case of the glide - mirror unfolding from the purely translational unfolding is the orbitally selective action of the matrices @xmath49 in eq .  .",
    "namely , in the case of translational unfolding , matrices @xmath49 act equally on all orbitals , while in the case of glide - mirror unfolding , they act differently , depending on whether the orbitals are symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to the reflections in the @xmath137-plane .",
    "for example , the @xmath175 orbital will stay invariant , while @xmath176 will pick up a minus sign under the action of @xmath172 .",
    "we have used eq .   to create the two sets of hopping energies , corresponding to two induced irreducible representations .",
    "these two sets correspond to the same 8-band tight - binding model , up to the unitary transformation .",
    "the bandstructure calculated from the 16-band and two 8-band tight - binding models along the path in the @xmath136 plane of the brillouin zone is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fese_tb_model ] ( a ) . the corresponding fermi surface slice in the @xmath136 plane is shown in fig .  [ fig : fese_tb_model ] ( c ) . in accordance with eq .   and the electronic structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fese_tb_model ] the folding vector is @xmath177 with respect to one iron brillouin zone ( as a convention , we will always specify folding vectors with respect to the unfolded brillouin zone ) .",
    "it is evident that the unfolding to the 8-band model is perfect in the @xmath136 plane .",
    "since the @xmath178 planes are also the high - symmetry planes for the reflections in the @xmath137-plane , the unfolding will be perfect there too .",
    "we can thus expect the largest deviations from the perfect unfolding around the @xmath179 plane .",
    "this can be seen in the bandstructure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fese_tb_model ] ( b ) , taken along the path shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fese_tb_model ] ( a ) shifted by @xmath180 .",
    "the deviations of the unfolded bands are evident .",
    "however , the deviations of the top ten bands , which are the bands dominated by the @xmath168 orbital character , are much smaller than in the bands dominated by the @xmath169 orbital character .",
    "this is a consequence of the crystal structure ; the iron atoms are stationary under the action of @xmath172 , while the selenium atoms are not . due to this property",
    ", the fermi surface can be unfolded almost exactly across the entire brillouin zone . the fermi surface slice in the @xmath181 is shown in fig .  [ fig : fese_tb_model ] ( d ) , while the vertical slice in the @xmath182 plane is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fese_tb_model ] ( e ) .",
    "it is remarkable that the full three dimensional structure of the innermost fermi surface pocket , centered at @xmath157 , is retained with high accuracy in the unfolded model , despite the fact that the underlying unfolding symmetry is purely two - dimensional .",
    "two adjacent brillouin zones corresponding to the two iron primitive cell of @xmath183 space group are shown in blue color .",
    "the simple tetragonal unit cell corresponding to the one iron unit cell is shown in red.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    finally , we would like to point out that the glide - mirror group can also be used to unfold the bandstructures of iron - based superconductors with a centered unit cell , described by symmorphic space groups . in this particular example",
    ", we use the ambient pressure structure of cafe@xmath138as@xmath138 measured at a temperature @xmath184  k and described by the body - centered spacegroup @xmath185  @xcite .",
    "cafe@xmath138as@xmath138 was selected because it features additional electron fermi surface pockets which make the one iron fermi surface determination more complicated .",
    "the glide - mirror operations as well as the irreducible representations are identical to the case of fese .",
    "the main difference here is that the resulting folding vector is @xmath186 , corresponding to the unfolding onto the simple tetragonal one iron unit cell .",
    "this result is not immediately obvious , since we are only using the symmetry of the iron - arsenic layer , and it is to be expected , in the nave picture , that the resulting unfolding would result in the one iron body - centered unit cell and the @xmath187 folding vector .",
    "however , due to the body - centered symmetry the @xmath187 folding vector relates @xmath157 and @xmath188 points , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bz_drawing ] .",
    "in addition , unlike @xmath186 , the @xmath187 folding vector does not satisfy eq .  , which underlines their usefulness .",
    "[ fig : cafe2as2_1fe_unfolding ]  ( a ) shows the bandstructure in the two - iron equivalent brillouin zone , while fig .",
    "[ fig : cafe2as2_1fe_unfolding ]  ( b ) shows the unfolded bandstructure in the one - iron equivalent brillouin zone obtained by extending @xmath154 .",
    "evidently , the unfolding remains perfect in the @xmath136 plane .",
    "however , this is no longer the case across the entire brillouin zone .",
    "for instance , along the @xmath189 path weak traces of bands from @xmath62 can be observed . in comparison to fese ,",
    "in the vicinity of the femi level , the cafe@xmath138as@xmath138 bandstructure features more orbital weight of arsenic @xmath169 and some calcium @xmath168 character which makes unfolding outside of the high - symmetry plane less accurate .",
    "nevertheless , we have enough information to clearly discern the topology of the unfolded fermi surface . figs .",
    "[ fig : cafe2as2_1fe_unfolding ]  ( c)-(e ) show the @xmath136 cut of the cafe@xmath138as@xmath138 fermi surface . because of the body - centered arrangement of the brillouin zones shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bz_drawing ] this is also the @xmath190 cut of the fermi surface , offset by @xmath187 and as a result the connectivity of the fermi surface elements can be deduced between the @xmath136 and @xmath190 planes .",
    "the above results have important implications for the one - iron vs. two - iron discussion in the iron pnictide literature  @xcite . since computation of such properties like multiorbital pairing calculations  @xcite scale as the sixth power of number of orbitals involved , it is important to keep the models as simple as possible .",
    "in addition , careful consideration of symmetry has very important consequences for the superconducting state @xcite .",
    "for this reason , one needs to understand the exact conditions and the symmetry context in which the one - iron model can be used .",
    "when the unfolding is considered as a projection onto the irreducible subspace of the glide - mirror group , some potentially important subtleties arise in comparison to the conclusions drawn in ref .  .",
    "as long as the electronic structure in the energy range of interest is dominated by the iron orbitals and all dynamics under consideration involve at least approximate glide - mirror symmetry , a one - iron tight - binding model can be used without significant impact on the overall accuracy of the calculation .",
    "furthermore , even in the cases where the glide - mirror symmetry is not so favorable , a controlled one - iron approximation can be made since the off - diagonal blocks in the decomposition onto irreducible subspaces can provide an error estimate .",
    "in addition , this shows that only the glide - mirror group can provide criteria that unambiguously resolve fermi surface elements in the process of unfolding to the one - iron brillouin zone .",
    "furthermore , our discussion of effects of high - symmetry elements of the brillouin zone on the interpretation of arpes data shows that under certain conditions it is possible to observe the spectral function consistent with the one iron picture in @xmath136 or @xmath190 planes .",
    "this is corroborated by recent observations @xcite in csfe@xmath138as@xmath138 whose electronic structure is weakly dispersive in the @xmath145 direction and the glide mirror unfolding can be accurately extended across the entire brillouin zone .",
    "the unfolding process also offers a simple answer to the question why the neutron scattering intensities seem to indicate a scenario consistent with the one - iron picture  @xcite .",
    "this can be naturally interpreted as a consequence of the fact that neutron scattering intensities are momentum - resolved in the high symmetry plane and transitions between states belonging to different irreducible subspaces are suppressed there .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated with a group - theoretical treatment of the bandstructure that unfolding can be understood as a projection onto induced irreducible representations of the supergroup of the original translation group .",
    "the unfolded brillouin zone arises as a consequence of the fact that different induced irreducible representations become identical when shifted by an appropriate vector in the brillouin zone . due to the projective definition",
    ", the unfolding procedure can be generalized for arbitrary quantities in reciprocal space . also",
    ", the unfolding artifacts in the cases where the unfolding is inexact arise because bands have nonzero projections onto multiple irreducible representations .",
    "when point group operations are used , the unfolding is exact only in the high - symmetry k - points of the brillouin zone .",
    "it is nonetheless possible to extend the unfolding to the entire brillouin zone as long as the bandstructure is dominantly dispersive only along the corresponding high - symmetry lines or planes in the brillouin zone . by making sure",
    "this constraint is satisfied , it is possible to formulate tight - binding models of reduced dimensionality without loss of accuracy . in the cases where this is not completely possible , the unfolding framework provides a systematic way to make controlled approximations by projecting the relevant quantities into appropriate irreducible subspaces .    for fese under pressure , we have shown how an 8-band tight - binding model can be constructed by unfolding the 16-band tight - binding model with the help of glide - mirror operations .",
    "the resulting unfolded model produces the almost exactly unfolded fermi surface .",
    "this results from the fact that the fermi surface in fese is dominated by the iron orbital character .",
    "this is in fact the most important requirement that needs to be fulfilled for the one iron model to be an accurate representation of the physics of iron based superconductors .",
    "an additional requirement stems from the fact that the one iron picture is formulated as an irreducible representation , and as such for any realistic computation using the one iron model , the off - diagonal elements of the involved observables , connecting the two irreducible representations of the glide - mirror group need to be small compared to the diagonal elements .    and",
    "finally , we show that careful interpretation of arpes data in cases where the direct comparison with density functional theory calculations is not immediately obvious , requires consideration of possible effects of high symmetry elements of the brillouin zone as well as comparison with all irreducible representations arising from the unfolding process .",
