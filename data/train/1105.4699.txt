    "the only goal of an experiment is to get new experimental information .",

    ", the most importance is their revealing and rejection .",
    "this process requires one to perform new experiments by the methods not used earlier and to reveal obvious errors in the performed earlier analysis of experimental data , for example .",
    "this problem appears itself most sharply in low energy nuclear physics .",
    "development of this branch of fundamental science is impossible without using different hypotheses and notions of nuclear properties determined , with the rare exception , only experimentally .",
    "moreover - only in the form which requires mathematical treatment of different extent of complexity , the following physics interpretation and model description .    to the",
    "all enumerated above completely corresponds the situation with investigation of nucleus properties at small ( up to @xmath3 mev ) excitation energy of arbitrary nucleus .",
    "physically it is set by nucleon binding energy @xmath4 in a nucleus .",
    "complete and correct understanding of properties and parameters of a process appeared by this requires one to determine with good precision the level density of a nucleus @xmath5 with given quantum parameters at any excitation energy and probability ( width ) @xmath6 of the reaction products emission ( strength function @xmath7 for gamma - quanta ) .",
    "there are no ways for complete achievement of this goal  resolution of existing spectrometers does not allow one to distinguish fixed nuclear levels lying by several mev above the ground state and , for example , by several kev above @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the values @xmath8 and @xmath9 can be obtained only from solution of reverse task of mathematical analysis ",

    "this solution in most cases is badly stipulated and ambiguous .",
    "i d est , the errors @xmath11 , @xmath12 can not be equal to zero even at zero experimental uncertainty of function @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , the shape of their functional relation is set a priory on the basis of existing notions . as a result ,",
    "the determined parameters of function @xmath14 contain usually more or less not removable systematical error .",
    "intensity of spectra of nuclear reaction products measured without coincidences with other products ( one - step reactions ) is determined by product of @xmath8 and @xmath6 .",
    "this circumstance increases relative error of determination of any of these parameters in case if another parameter was set independently , for example , by means of some nuclear model .",
    "really , at present this possibility can be realized only with unknown systematical error .",
    "a lack of further progress in development of the methods for experimental determination of @xmath8 and @xmath6 in one - step reactions means , in practice , that the potential of their possibilities is exhausted .    at the same time , real progress in experimental determination of @xmath8 and @xmath6 can be achieved only from comparison of the data of independent experiments .",
    "this can be made by analysis of results of multi - step reactions ( registration in coincidence of intensity of cascades from two and more successive nuclear reaction products ) .",
    "just study of these cascades terminating at one or several final levels allowed one to realize independent model - free method for determination of maximum reliable values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",

    "the main and absolutely necessary condition for obtaining of reliable information from two - step reactions is maximaly possible test of existing information used in analysis of experiment .",
    "just practical realization of this condition allowed one to create the method for simultaneous model - free determination of @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite from experimental spectra by use of only algorithms , rules and principles of mathematic and mathematical statistics .",
    "non - observance of these theses guaranties appearance of principle discrepancies between the data obtained by different groups from the one hand and circulation of earlier appeared systematical errors - from the other hand .",
    "the latest example of this kind is the analysis of the two - step cascade intensities measured by authors @xcite in reaction @xmath0co@xmath15ni .",
    "experimental spectrum in this as well as in some tens of analogous cases has the following peculiarities :    \\(a ) it is the sum of two unknown functions corresponding to near by energy primary and secondary gamma - transitions in any interval of their values ;    \\(b ) the sum of intensities of all the possible two - step cascades ( plus primary transition to the ground state ) always equals 100% ;    \\(c ) the experimental spectra can be reproduced with the @xmath16 value by infinite number of different functions @xmath8 and @xmath6 from limited interval of their values ;    \\(d ) the relation between change in cascade intensity @xmath17 and changes in @xmath18 and @xmath19 is non - linear and strongly different for various energies of cascade gamma - quanta ;    \\(e ) the confidence interval for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 values , reproducing @xmath20 , has practically acceptable width only by use of the procedure @xcite in analysis of experiment .    potential possibility to account for",
    "enumerated above specifics of the analysis of the two - step cascade intensities takes place and in the case @xcite .",
    "level scheme of @xmath2ni below excitation energy of 5 mev includes @xcite less than 40 secondary transitions to level @xmath21 mev and , correspondingly , the spectrum  narrow peaks .",
    "the use of method @xcite in this case would allow one to determine two - step cascade intensities in function on their primary transition energy with the error caused , in practice , only by the total error of approximation of peak areas .",
    "rather essential discrepancies between the experimental and calculated by authors @xcite spectra of cascade intensities ( for example , for @xmath22 ) mev guarantee , by conditions ( b ) and ( d ) , their undoubted difference of unknown amplitude in any other points of the spectrum .",
    "\\3 . according to @xcite , from combination of the individual cascade intensities and intensities of their primary and secondary gamma - transitions , authors of @xcite",
    "could additionally estimate to the first approach the dependence of radiative strength functions on energy of levels excited by the primary gamma - transitions .",
    "the presence of these errors unambiguously requires reanalysis of the experimental data on the two - step cascade intensities in @xmath2ni .",
    "analogous reanalysis accounting for the mentioned above specific of the experiment was earlier performed for @xmath23fe , @xcite , @xmath24mo @xcite , @xmath25yb @xcite and for some other nuclei . in all these cases",
    "real systematical errors of the values of level densities and radiative strength functions cited in original articles are maximally large .",
    "systematical error in determination of @xmath8 and @xmath6 from cascade intensities are caused , first of all , by systematical error of determination of absolute value of cascade intensity . according to @xcite ,",
    "if its value is small enough ( @xmath26 ) , then distortions of obtained parameters are also comparatively small .",
    "their further reduction can be provided by careful choice of additional experimental data involved in analysis .",
    "the total intensity of two - step cascades was renormalized from the data @xcite and accepted to be equal to 33 events per 100 decays for @xmath27 mev .",
    "( for example , a portion of the most intense cascades in near - magic nuclei @xmath28nd and @xmath29hg equals accordingly 32% and 35% @xcite ) . by this ,",
    "intensity of cascades in interval about @xmath30 mev was changed by us to intensity in interval @xmath31 mev because of presence of undoubted error in @xcite .",
    "the distribution of number of decaying initial cascade levels was taken in accordance with @xcite equal to 39.6 ; 3.7 and 4.5% for spins",
    "@xmath32 correspondingly ( for orbital moment of captured protons @xmath33 ) . in analysis below @xmath34 mev",
    "were used known scheme of level density and modes of their decay .",
    "parameters of the fermi - gas model  one of the variants of initial level density in random iteration process @xcite for determination of @xmath8 and @xmath6  were taken from @xcite .",

    "the value of spacing @xmath35 between s - resonances for @xmath0ni was taken from the same compilation .",
    "the part of levels of negative parity was additionally varied in iterative process with respect of initial one ( it linearly decreases from 50% for @xmath4 to 0  at @xmath34 mev at the first step of calculations ) .",
    "all existing now experimental data on intensities of two - step cascades in more than 50 nuclei from @xmath36al to @xmath29hg demonstrate negligibly small role of pure quadruple transitions .",

    "its mean - squared value in some energy intervals exceeds the average @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in these cases , the errors  down \" in figures 4 and 5 are absent .",
    "of course , each of random functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 has errors caused by uncertainty of experimental data and different reasons for appearance of fluctuations of widths of primary and secondary transitions .",
    "but , in difference of principle from @xcite , the best values of @xmath8 and @xmath6 include the dependence of @xmath8 and @xmath9 on nuclear structure at @xmath44 to the maximum extent .",
    "such possibility is completely absent in data treatment @xcite .",
    "the data presented in fig . 3 show that obligatory accounting for the obtained in oslo low energy  tail \" of strength functions is not required for description of cascade intensity .",
    "but , it must be noted that the errors of the data presented in figures 2 and 3 are maximal for the region of excitations lying above @xmath45 mev owing to small statistics and use of the least informative experimental spectrum ( relatively to possible cascade intensities in function on their primary transition energy @xcite ) . due to this reason they are of small efficiency for determination of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 values corresponding to this energy",
    "enormous dispersion of the data in figures 2 and 3 is unambiguously caused by the fact that the calculated by use of these data cascade intensity with primary and secondary gamma - transitions with energies from the same interval really correspond to combinations of analogous unknown experimental functions @xmath46 and arbitrary unknown error @xmath47 : @xmath48    as a result , this brings to deviations of @xmath8 and @xmath9 with different sign and maximal by module for @xmath49 .",

    "nevertheless , concrete conclusions on gamma - decay process and its parameters can be made from model approximation of obtained here @xmath8 and @xmath9 and for this nucleus .",
    "model approximation of functional dependences @xmath50 and @xmath51 was performed below for the averages of random functions figs . 2 and 3 and , therefore , its concrete results are to be considered as rough enough .",
    "that is why , approximation of @xmath50 was performed in the simplest variant @xmath52const , but with accounting for influence of shell inhomogeneities of one - particle spectrum on parameter @xmath53 .    in some cases , as a minimum it is possible to determine a sign of corresponding uncertainty",
    "so , a lack of the data on extent of dependence of @xmath54 on excitation energy rather essentially increases error in determination of @xmath8 and @xmath6 .",
    "however , it follows from comparison of variants for their determination @xcite and @xcite that the obtained for nickel and presented in figures 4 and 5 @xmath8 values are overestimated and @xmath9  underestimated .",

    "level density in @xmath2ni , obtained from the spectra of evaporation nucleons in @xcite , very strongly differs from function @xmath8 precisely reproducing cascade intensities ( fig .",

    "it is calculated only by optical model of a nucleus and only in the frameworks of unvereficated hypothesis on independence of partial width @xmath6 of emission of the nuclear reaction product on nuclear structure .",

    "conclusion about dependence of @xmath6 on nuclear structure ( i d est , excitation energy of final nucleus ) unambiguously follows , for example , from @xcite . and",
    "it fully agrees with the obvious axiom that any extrapolation of theoretical model in unstudied region of excitations has an error which can be determined only experimentally .    according to hauser - feshbach notion ,",
    "the cross - section under consideration is determined by sum over initial and final levels of products of type @xmath71 for the final reaction product @xmath72 @xcite :    @xmath73    where @xmath74    it follows from ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) that at presence of unknown error @xmath75 of the calculated @xmath6 width value , experimental cross - section @xmath69 can be precisely reproduced only by using level density with adequate systematical error .",
    "if the calculated partial @xmath76 and experimental @xmath77 widths obey to correlation @xmath78 , then the level density @xmath79 must be used in calculation for reproduction of cross - section ( 2 ) .",
    "of course , unknown relative error @xmath75 of calculated width depends on excitation energy of final nucleus and can depend on spin of levels which are connected each to other at @xmath72 reaction product emission . in this case , the error @xmath75 is the weight average . if one determines it using relation : @xmath80 , which connects level density @xmath81 determined from evaporation spectrum @xcite with density @xmath82 , derived from cascade intensity ( fig .",
    "4 ) , then the error of the calculated cross - section @xmath69 can be directly estimated at any excitation energy of final nucleus .",
    "the result is presented in fig .",
    "the main error of the presented in this figure data is related to the fact that the @xmath8 value was determined directly from two - step experimental spectrum , but not from cascade intensities for given energy of their primary transition and because of lack of information on function @xmath83",

    "serious systematical error in this case can have only more fundamental character .",
    "for instance , connected with lack of the model of gamma - decay of highly excited levels accounting in available ( for analysis of experimental data ) form for coexistence and interaction of excitations of fermion and boson type and so on .",
    "confirmation of the data on level density derived from the spectra of evaporation nucleons by analogous data from the two - step cascade intensities is achieved only subjectively at serious violations of statements of mathematics and mathematical statistics at analysis of @xmath85 .    \\2 . as in the other spherical even - even nuclei ,",
    "taking into consideration , break of three cooper pairs of nucleons is quite enough for model description @xcite of level density in @xmath2ni below @xmath4 .",
    "collective effects increase level density by order of magnitude .",
    "\\3 . high degree of averaging of cascade intensities over their initial levels allows one to expect considerable averaging of strength functions .",
    "in particular , the strength function of the primary gamma - transitions to the first two - phonon state @xmath86 mev of this nucleus is increased , as a minimum , by order of magnitude with respect to the model @xcite predicted values .",
    "it is possible also that the increased gamma - transitions following decay of different initial cascade levels selectively excite groups of levels of collective structure at different excitation energy .",
    "i d est , the parameters of model approximation of the strength function determined from  averaged resonances \" can strongly differ from analogous strength functions of decay of the only initial cascade level .",
    "precise description of the two - step gamma - cascade intensities does not require increase of strength functions at decrease of gamma - transitions energy .",
    "this effect is easily quantitatively explained even by small errors @xcite at normalization of the total gamma - spectra at different excitation energy of spherical nucleus .",
    "the notion of authors , for instance , @xcite that the approximate equality of level densities derived by them from the spectra of evaporation nucleons in different nuclear reactions is a proof of absence of systematical errors is obviously mistaken . in practice",
    ", these very big errors of the calculated value of cross - section are completely correlated .",
    "i d est , they are caused by strong influence of structure of excited levels of final nucleus but not  by any errors of the used optical potentials .",
    "because dominant proton capture occurs @xcite to the level @xmath87 , then this strongest increase of strength function is first observed for the primary @xmath88-transitions of the compound - state decay to final two - phonon level .",
