    "the more complex a data site or mathematical model is the more adapted a corresponding mathematical representation needs to be in order to capture its information content at acceptable cost in terms of storage and computational complexity . in principle , this is true for mathematical objects described explicitly by large sets of possibly noisy or corrupted data but also for those given only implicitly as the solution of an operator equation .",
    "the latter scenario is perhaps even more challenging because direct observations are not possible . by `` adapted representation '' we mean a representation of the unknown function that exploits possibly global features of this function so as to require , for a prescribed target accuracy , only relatively few parameters to determine a corresponding approximation .",
    "such global features could take a variety of forms such as ( i ) a high degree of regularity except at isolated singularities _ located on lower dimensional manifolds _ , or ( ii ) a particular _ sparsity _ possibly with respect to a _ dictionary _ which may even depend on the problem at hand .",
    "in fact , corresponding scenarios are not strictly disjoint . in either case reconstruction or approximation methods are necessarily nonlinear .",
    "for instance , as for ( i ) , 1d",
    "_ best @xmath1-term _ wavelet approximations offer a powerful method based on selecting only possible few coefficients in an exact representation with respect to a given _ universal background _ dictionary , e.g. a wavelet basis .",
    "when dealing with more than one spatial variable the situation quickly becomes more complicated and for spatial dimensions much larger than three , classical numerical tools designed for the low dimensional regime become practically useless .",
    "this is commonly referred to as _ curse of dimensionality_. unfortunately , there seems to be no universal strategy of dealing with the curse of dimensionality , i.e. , that works in all possible cases .",
    "one global structural feature which is encountered in many multivariate scenarios is _ anisotropy _ : images , as fuctions of two variables , exhibit edges and discontinuities along curves .",
    "higher dimensional biological images have sharp interfaces separating more homgeneous regions .",
    "likewise highly anisotropic phenomena such as shear- or boundary layers are encountered in solutions to transport dominated initial - boundary value problems .",
    "one major focus of this project has been to efficiently recover and economically encode _ anisotropic _ structures represented by explicitly given data or determined as solutions of operator equations which are prone to give rise to such structures",
    ". regarding this latter case , which we will focus on in this article , _ parametric transport problems _ ( as well as close relatives ) have served as guiding model problems for the following reasons : ( i ) their solutions could exhibit shear or boundary layers and hence discontinuities across lower dimensional manifolds calling for suitable _ anisotropic discretizations _ ; ( ii ) how to contrive suitable _ variational formulations _ , which in particular accommodate such anisotropic discretizations is much less clear than in the elliptic case ; ( iii ) _ parametric versions _ give rise to _ high - dimensional _ problems .    concerning ( i ) , _ directional representation systems _ like _ curvelets _ and _ shearlets _ outperform classical _ isotropic _ wavelet bases when approximating so called `` cartoon images '' , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for recent applications to imaging data , in particular , _ inpainting _ as well as in combination with _ geometric separation concepts _ the reader is referred to @xcite . in the present context of solving operator equations we outline in section [ dahmen_huang_kutyniok_lim_schwab : sect2 ] trial spaces which accommodate directional adaptivity.they",
    "are motivated by recent constructions of compactly supported _ piecewise polynomial shearlet systems _",
    "( see e.g. @xcite ) because they are close to classical multiresolution structures and similar in nature to classical discretization systems .",
    "since cartoons exhibit structural similarities with the solution to transport problems we state best @xmath1-term error bounds for cartoon functions that will later serve as benchmarks for an adaptive solver . for related anisotropic simplicial discretizations and their analysis see e.g. @xcite .    as for ( ii )",
    ", our approach differs from previous works on anisotropic discretizations derived from `` curvature information '' on the current approximation and hence not based on a rigorous error control ( see e.g. @xcite and the references therein ) , in that we derive first in section [ dahmen_huang_kutyniok_lim_schwab : stabvar ] _ well conditioned variational formulations _ for general unsymmetric or indefinite and singularly perturbed problems , see @xcite for details on _ convection - diffusion _ and _ transport problems_. the underlying basic principles are of independent interest by themselves and seem to have appeared first in @xcite .",
    "they are also closely related to ongoing developments running under the flag of _ discontinuous petrov galerkin ( dpg ) methods _ , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the approach is motivated by two crucial corner stones . on the one hand",
    ", one can essentially _ choose _ the norm for the ( infinite dimensional ) trial space @xmath2 by which one would like to measure accuracy while adapting the norm for the ( infinite dimensional ) test space @xmath3 so as to ensure that ( ideally ) the operator induced by this variational formulation is even an isometry from @xmath2 to @xmath4 ( the normed dual of @xmath3 ) .",
    "numerical feasibility of ( nearly optimal ) petrov galerkin discretizations based on such formulations , even beyond a dpg framework , hinges on an appropriate _ saddle point formulation _ which turns out to be actually crucial in connection with _ model reduction _ @xcite . on the one hand , this allows one to accommodate , for instance , @xmath0-frames . on the other hand ,",
    "the resulting tight error - residual relation is the basis of computable a - posteriori error estimators @xcite and , ultimately , to rigorously founded adaptive anisotropic refinement strategies .",
    "these variational formulations apply in much more generality but in order to address issue ( iii ) we exemplify them for the simple linear transport equation ( stationary or instationary ) whose _ parametric _ version leads to high - dimensional problems and forms a core constituent of kinetic models such as _ radiative transport_. there the transport direction - the parameter - varies over a unit sphere so that solutions are functions of the spatial variables ( and , possibly , of time ) and of the transport direction .",
    "we briefly highlight two ways of treating such parametric problems under slightly different objectives .",
    "both strategies aim at approximating the solution @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , in the form @xmath8 in section [ dahmen_huang_kutyniok_lim_schwab : rbm ] the @xmath9 are constructed _ offline _ in a greedy manner from _ snapshots _ of the solution manifold , thus forming a _ solution dependent _ dictionary . according to the paradigm of the _ reduced basis method _ ( rbm )",
    "the parameter dependent coefficients @xmath10 are not given explicitly but can be efficiently computed in an _ online _ fashion , e.g. in the context of design or ( online ) optimization .",
    "this approach works the better the smoother the dependence of the solution on the parameters is so that the kolmogorov @xmath11-widths decay rapidly with increasing @xmath11 . making essential use of the well conditioned variational formulations from section [ dahmen_huang_kutyniok_lim_schwab : stabvar ] , it can be shown that the resulting rbm has stability constants as close to one as one wishes yielding for the first time an rbm for transport and convection - diffusion problems with this property exhibiting the same rates as the kolmogorov widths @xcite .    in section [ dahmen_huang_kutyniok_lim_schwab : radtrans ] of this report , and in @xcite , we present algorithms which construct _ explicitly _ separable approximations of the form for the parametric transport problem of radiative transfer .",
    "we also mention that separable approximations such as arise in a host of other applications ; for example , in parametric representations of pdes with random field input data with the aid of sparse tensor product interpolation methods ; we refer to @xcite and to the references therein .",
    "adaptive near - minimal rank tensor solvers for problems in high dimensional phase space are established and analyzed in @xcite .",

    "the class of _ cartoon - like functions _ on @xmath12 , @xmath15 ( where the parameters @xmath16 are not mutually independent ) has become a well accepted benchmark for sparse approximation in imaging @xcite .",
    "compactly supported shearlet systems for @xmath17 have been introduced in @xcite to provide ( near- ) optimal sparse approximations for such classes .",
    "we observe that such cartoons also exhibit similar features as solutions to transport problems .",
    "unfortunately , even compactly supported shearlets do not comply well with quadrature and boundary adaptation tasks faced in variational methods for pdes .",
    "we are therefore interested in generating locally refinable anisotropic partitions for which corresponding piecewise polynomial approximations realize the favorable near - optimal approximation rates for cartoon functions achieved by shearlet systems . unfortunately , as shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 9.3 ) , simple triangular bisections connecting the midpoint of an edge to the opposite vertex is not sufficient for warranting such rates , see for related work .",
    "in fact , a key feature would be to realize a `` parabolic scaling law '' similar to the shearlet setting . by this",
    "we mean a sufficient rapid directional resolution by anisotropic cells whose width scales like the square of the diameter . to achieve this we consider partitions comprised of triangles _ and",
    "_ quadrilaterals pointed out to us in @xcite .",
    "we sketch the main ideas and refer to @xcite for details .    starting from some initial partition consisting of triangles and quadrilaterals , _ refined partitions _ are obtained by splitting a given cell @xmath18 of a current partition according to one of the following rules :    1 .",
    "connect a vertex with the midpoint of an edge not containing the vertex .",
    "2 .   connect two vertices .",
    "3 .   connect the midpoints of two edges which , when @xmath18 is a quadrilateral , do not share any vertex .",
    "the types of bisections are indicated in figure [ dahmen_huang_kutyniok_lim_schwab : refinement ] :     ( -280,5)(1 ) ( -215,5)(2 ) ( -152,5)(3 ) ( -90,5)(4 ) ( -30,5)(5 )    ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) are examples of ( i ) , ( 3 ) illustrates ( ii ) , and ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) are examples for ( iii ) .",

    "in this section we highlight some new conceptual developments from @xcite which , are , in particular , relevant for the high dimensional parametric problems addressed later below .",
    "anisotropic structures are already exhibited by solutions of elliptic boundary value problems on polyhedral domains in 3d .",
    "however , related singularities are known a priori and can be dealt with by anisotropic preset mesh refinements .",
    "anisotropic structures of solutions to transport dominated problems can be less predictable so that a quest for _ adaptive anisotropic _ discretization principles gains more weight .",
    "recall that every known rigorously founded adaptation strategy hinges in one way or the other on being able to relate a current error of an approximate solution to the corresponding _ residual _ in a suitable norm .",
    "while classical variational formulations of elliptic problems grant exactly such an error - residual relation , this is unclear for transport dominated problems .",
    "the first fundamental issue is therefore to _ find _ also for such problems suitable variational formulations yielding a well conditioned error - residual relation .",
