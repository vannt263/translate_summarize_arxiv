    "in recent papers , convection experiments of supercritical @xmath0he in a rayleigh - benard cell with a constant heat current @xmath3 were reported@xcite .",

    "assuming that @xmath3 is larger than a critical heat flux necessary to produce fluid instability , @xmath4 passes over a maximum at the time @xmath5 , which indicates that the fluid is convecting and that plumes have reached the top plate",
    ". then truncated or damped oscillations , the latter with a period @xmath6 , are observed under certain conditions before steady - state conditions for convection are reached , as described in refs.@xcite .",
    "the scenario of the damped oscillations , and the role of the  piston effect \" has been described in detail in refs.@xcite and @xcite and will not be repeated here .",
    "the height of the layer in the rb cell was @xmath1 = 0.106 cm and the aspect ratio @xmath7=57 .",
    "the @xmath0he convection experiments along the critical isochore extended over a range of reduced temperatures between 5@xmath8 0.2 , where @xmath9 with @xmath10 = 3.318 k , the critical temperature .",
    "the truncated - or damped oscillations were observed for @xmath11 0.009 and over this range the fluid compressibility varies by a factor of about 30 .    the scaled representation of the characteristic times @xmath6 and @xmath12 versus the rayleigh number , and the comparison with the results from simulations has been described in ref.@xcite .",
    "good agreement for the period @xmath6was reported .",
    "however a systematic discrepancy for the times @xmath12 shows that in the simulations the development of convection is retarded compared to the experiments .",
    "this effect increases with decreasing values of @xmath13 $ ] , where @xmath14 is the rayleigh number corrected for the adiabatic temperature gradient as defined in refs.@xcite and @xmath15 is the critical rayleigh number for the experimental conditions , 1708 .",
    "this is shown in fig.1 of ref.@xcite , in particular in fig.1b ) for @xmath16 = 0.2 and @xmath3 = 2.16@xmath17 w/@xmath18 ( @xmath13 $ ] = 635 ) , where an experimental run is compared with simulations for the same parameters .",
    "here clearly the profile @xmath4 from the simulations shows the smooth rise until the steady - state value , @xmath19 = 95 @xmath2k has been reached , where @xmath20 is the thermal conductivity . only at t @xmath21",
    "90 s. does convection develop , as shown by a sudden decrease of @xmath4 .",
    "by contrast , the experimental profile shows a much earlier development of convection .",
    "fig.1 of ref.@xcite is representative for the observations at low values of @xmath22 $ ] . at high values ,",
    "both experiment and simulations show the convection development to take place at comparable times , as indicated in fig.5b ) of ref.@xcite , and specifically in fig.2 a ) of ref.@xcite , where @xmath22 $ ] = 4.1@xmath23 .",
    "it is the purpose of this report to investigate the origin of this discrepancy by further simulation studies .",
    "el khouri and carls@xcite studied theoretically the stability limit of a supercritical fluid in a rb cell , when subjected to a heat current @xmath3 started at the time @xmath24 = 0 .",
    "their fluid was also @xmath0he at the critical density , and the same parameters as in ref.@xcite were used .",
    "they calculated the time @xmath25 and also the corresponding @xmath26 for the onset of fluid instability and they determined the modes and the wave vectors of the perturbations for different scenarios of @xmath3 and @xmath16 . for @xmath27 inhomogeneities in the rb cell and noise within the fluid will produce perturbations which will grow , from which the convection will develop .",
    "an indication of the growth of convection is a deviation of the @xmath4 profile in the experiments or in the simulations from the calculated curve for the stable fluid ( see for instance eq.3.3 of ref@xcite ) .",
    "it is readily seen from simulation profiles such as fig.1a ) and b ) in ref.@xcite that the deviation becomes significant for @xmath24 only slightly below @xmath12 - the maximum of @xmath4 . in simulations ,",
    "the effective start of convection can also be seen from snapshots in 2d of the fluid temperature contour lines at various times , as shown in fig .",
    "5 of ref.@xcite .",
    "p.carls @xcite has argued that the reason for the discrepancy for the time @xmath12 between experiment and simulation is that in the former , the physical system has noise and inhomogeneities which cause the perturbations beyond @xmath25 to grow into the developed convection .",
    "by contrast simulations have a much smaller noise .",
    "therefore in the simulations the perturbations take a longer time to grow than in the physical system , leading to a larger @xmath12 than observed .",
    "carls comment led us to try as a first step imposing a thermal random noise on the top plate of the rb cell , which was to simulate fluctuations in the upper plate temperature control of the laboratory experiment .",
    "the temperature of the plate was assumed to be uniform , because of the large thermal diffusivity @xmath28 @xmath18/s . of the copper plate in the experiments .",
    "accordingly simulations were carried out by the numerical method described in ref.@xcite with a homogeneous time - dependent temperature random fluctuation of given rms amplitude imposed on the upper plate .",
    "this implementation consisted in adding or subtracting randomly temperature spikes @xmath29 at the time @xmath24 with a programmed rms amplitude at steps separated by 0.02 s. this interval is much larger than the estimated relaxation time of the top plate over a distance @xmath30 , approximately the wavelength of convection roll pair .",
    "values of the variance a = @xmath31 were chosen between 0 and 40 @xmath2k .",
    "the range of the a values was taken well beyond the estimated fluctuation rms amplitude during the experiments@xcite of @xmath32 .",
    "three representative curves with 0 , 3 and 40 @xmath2k are shown in fig.1a ) by dashed lines for @xmath16 = 0.2 for @xmath3= 2.16@xmath33 w/@xmath18 , @xmath1 = 0.106 cm and @xmath7 = 5.1 .",
    "for this value of @xmath3 , the calculation by el khouri and carls @xcite give @xmath25 = 6.3 s and @xmath26 = 75 @xmath2k .",
    "in the simulation without imposed noise , the start of convection has therefore been considerably delayed relative to @xmath25 .",
    "the injection of random noise has a significant effect in developing convection at an earlier time . in fig.1a )",
    "the three curves are also compared with the experimental one , shown by a solid line .",
    "here we have not incorporated into the simulations the delay affecting the experimental temperature recording , so that they could be intercompared more readily , and also with predictions@xcite however this operation will be presented in fig.4 .",
    "further simulations with added random noise were carried out for @xmath16 = 0.2 and 0.05 where the @xmath4 time profiles are not shown here .",
    "fig.2a ) shows a plot of the time of the developed convection , represented by @xmath12 , versus the random rms amplitude a for three series of simulations , all taken for a cell with @xmath7 = 5.1 .",

    "it can be clearly seen that noise imposition , which creates a vertical disturbance across the fluid layer , reduces the time of convection development . while the decrease of @xmath12 is strong for small values of a , it saturates at a certain level of noise amplitude .",
    "the gap between simulations and experiment increases with a decrease of [ @xmath35 , namely as the fluid stability point is approached .",
    "critical slowing down \" is seen in the effectiveness of the perturbations in triggering the instability .",
    "hence this mode of noise introduction fails , because its amplitude is limited to the vertical z direction and it evidently couples only weakly into the convective motion .     from experiments ( solid line with noise ) and from several simulations ( dashed lines ) at @xmath16 = 0.2 , @xmath3= 2.16@xmath17 w/@xmath18 . in the simulations , @xmath7=5 and",

    "the horizontal dashed line indicates @xmath12 as obtained by experiment , corrected as before.,width=307 ]    in parallel with the present experiments , s. amiroudine@xcite also carried out a systematic study of simulations on supercritical @xmath0he in a rb cell for several values of @xmath16 and @xmath3 .",
    "he used a numerical scheme based on the exact navier stokes equation as described in ref.@xcite .",
    "the resulting profiles @xmath4 could be compared with those from experiments done under nearly the same conditions . in his simulations ,",
    "homogeneous temperature random noise was again imposed on the top plate .",
    "the shift in @xmath12 showed less systematic trends than in the results described in this report .",
    "however for the same values of @xmath16 and @xmath3 as those reported above , and at zero noise , the @xmath12 values tended to be somewhat smaller than in the results of fig 2a ) .    here",
    "we mention that the onset of convection in the simulations is further influenced by the aspect ratio @xmath7 .",
    "the simulations described above , but without noise , were carried out in a cell @xmath7 = 5.1 having periodic lateral boundaries .",
    "further simulations with zero noise for @xmath16 = 0.2 with @xmath7 = 8.0 , 10.2 , 20.5 and 41.0 were carried out , and showed a decrease of the convection development time from @xmath21 90 s , tending to a constant value of @xmath21 60 s. above @xmath7 = 20 .",
    "this shift in the onset of instability is due to the decreased finite size effect which the rising plumes experience with increasing @xmath7 , in spite of the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the curves labeled  o \" in figs 1a and 1b with @xmath7 = 5 and 8 respectively .",
    "the next step in our attempts , stimulated by communications with p. carls , was introducing perturbations into the simulations via some time - independent lateral variation proportional to sin ( 2@xmath40 ) where @xmath41 is the period .",
    "we opted to introduce again a temperature variation in the top plate with an amplitude b ( in @xmath2k ) and period @xmath41=2@xmath1 , nearly the same as the wavelength of a pair of convection rolls .",
    "the temperature of the bottom plate was kept homogeneous .",
    "this  gedanken experiment \" implies that the material of the top plate permitted a temperature inhomogeneity , which of course is not realized in the experiment .",
    "however a small lateral temperature excursion can trigger the same kind of non - homogeneous perturbations as those which , in the real experiment , provoke the onset of convection .",
    "one possible origin of such perturbations , besides thermal noise , could be the roughness of the plates or their slight deviation from parallelism",
    ". such geometrical defects could of course not be implemented in the numerical simulations with the meshsize used , which is why we elected to force a small temperature perturbation instead , with similar effects on the onset . as a control experiment",
    ", we also made a simulation with @xmath42 .",
    "fig 1b ) shows representative profiles @xmath4 for the parameters @xmath16 = 0.2 and @xmath3= 2.16@xmath17 w/@xmath18 and with b = 0 , 0.5 and 1.5 @xmath2k , and for @xmath7=8 . as b",
    "is increased from zero , there is a large decrease in the time for convection development , represented by @xmath12 , which is plotted versus b in fig 2b ) .",
    "the horizontal dashed line shows the @xmath12 from the experiment , and this plot is to be compared with fig .",
    "for an inhomogeneity amplitude of only b= 0.5@xmath2k , @xmath12 is nearly the same for simulations and experiment .",
    "by contrast , simulations with b=2@xmath2k and @xmath41=@xmath1 ( not presented here ) show no difference from those with b=0 .",
    "hence the nucleation of the convection is accelerated if the period is in approximate resonance with the wavelength of a convection roll pair .",
    "the values of steady - state @xmath43 and @xmath6 are only marginally affected by the noise .",
    "we note from fig.1b ) that the simulation curve calculated for b = 0 shows the fluid not convecting until @xmath21 70 s. for the curves with b= 0.5 @xmath2k .",

    "the stability analysis in @xcite becomes irrelevant , since the base flow , the stability of which is analysed , has been significantly modified by the perturbations .",
    "we also note that the time interval @xmath48 between the first sign of instability ( @xmath49 ) and @xmath12 is @xmath21 20 s , and roughly independent of b. this represents approximately the period taken by the convection to develop and for the plumes to reach the top plate boundary .    in fig.3",
