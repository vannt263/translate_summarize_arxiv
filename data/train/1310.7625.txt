    "these constants renormalize the theory canceling the divergences of the feynman diagrams through .    as easily evinced from ,",
    "up to two loops the diagrams involved in the renormalization of are the same involved in the standard perturbation theory .",
    "the only difference lies in the propagator that is here modified by the ir cutoff @xmath8 and in momentum space takes the form @xmath47 . for the computation",
    ", we found it convenient to choose the optimized form @xcite given by @xmath48 we illustrate the effects of the ir cutoff taking a closer look at two diagrams . at one loop ,",
    "the relevant diagram for the computation of @xmath49 is @xmath50 whose finite part we gave at zero external momenta . at two loops",
    "one of the relevant diagrams is @xmath51 the diagrams and illustrate the general property that the highest divergence of the @xmath52th loop , which diverges as @xmath53 , is _ never _ dressed by the frg scale @xmath2 .",
    "this property is not hard to be shown to hold for any admissible cutoff choice .",
    "subdivergences and finite parts , instead , do depend on @xmath2 .",
    "however , counterdiagrams appearing from second loop order on are tailored to cancel against subdivergences .",
    "therefore , it is possible to prove in general that the divergent part of the eaa does not depend on @xmath2 consistently with the requirement . the renormalization constants take the standard values of the @xmath32 scheme @xmath54 the renormalization is completed requiring that @xmath55 is independent of the reference scale @xmath33 as a function of @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "we can derive the @xmath56 function and the anomalous dimension in the usual way @xmath57 the above results , together with the diagrammatic expansion arising from , show that the frg method reproduces perturbation theory and , in particular , the @xmath32 scheme at two loops .",
    "it is however instructive to elaborate further in this direction .",
    "the scale @xmath2 of the frg plays a crucial role in reconstructing the loop expansion and unveils the presence of divergences that required renormalization through .",
    "however , the property allows one to subtract the divergences , and therefore to renormalize , using solely the reference scale @xmath33 of the @xmath32 scheme , while @xmath2 plays no role .",
    "this implies that the renormalized coupling @xmath41 defined in is actually the renormalized coupling of the @xmath32 scheme and therefore we shall refer to it as @xmath58 , while its @xmath56 function will be @xmath59 .",
    "generally , the couplings of the frg method are defined through an operatorial expansion of the eaa of the form @xmath60 = \\int\\ ! { \\rm d}^dx \\sum_i g_i(k ) { \\cal o}_i\\!\\left(\\varphi\\right)\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath61 are the @xmath2-dependent couplings , @xmath62 are the corresponding operators and the index @xmath63 ranges over all possible operators compatible with the symmetries of the system ( @xmath64 parity in the case of the simple scalar @xcite ) .",
    "the frg beta functions of the couplings @xmath61 are defined as their @xmath18 derivatives and computed by inserting in .",
    "we define @xmath65 as the coefficient of the @xmath66 operator or , alternatively , the local part of the four - point function of the model . using the perturbative technique described above we have access to an expression for @xmath65 as a function of @xmath67 through the finite parts of the loop expansion . the relevant result at one loop is contained in the finite part of as @xmath68 this computation can be performed for any coupling @xmath61 and at any loop order ( in particular beyond the one loop method developed in @xcite ) .",
    "specializing to the case @xmath69 we derive a perturbative scheme - change relation between the couplings of the @xmath32 and frg schemes @xmath70    the transformation is a function of the dimensionless ratio of the renormalized mass with the rg scale because of dimensional reasons , and its form depends on the @xmath71 scheme through the choice we made for the ir cutoff .",
    "a similar result was obtained in @xcite , where an equivalent relation between the @xmath32 scheme and the wilsonian blocking rg is computed .",
    "presumably , the result may reduce to what is obtained in @xcite if a specific sharp cutoff @xmath8 is chosen in place of to mimic the effects of blocking . the method outlined in this section",
    ", however , is very general and the computation can be repeated for any cutoff choice and for any perturbative regularization method at will and at any loop order .",
    "it is instructive to compute the beta function of the @xmath71 scheme _ from _ the one of the @xmath32 scheme . at one loop",
    "we obtain @xmath72 where at this order the mass can belong to either scheme and the perturbative inverse of was used .",
    "the result is in agreement with the computations performed in the frg approach @xcite .",
    "furthermore @xmath73 underlies the fact that the beta functions of the frg approach are not universal in the customary sense of qft .",
    "this is due to the fact that the frg method is a mass - dependent scheme and manifests through the nontrivial coupling of mass and scale in .",
    "nevertheless it is possible to explicitly and perturbatively map the results of @xmath32 and frg .",
    "the topic of universality of frg results is discussed in @xcite and is treated extensively in @xcite .",
    "we shall now outline the construction of a new scheme , first hinted by papenbrock and wetterich in @xcite , that obtains universal results within the frg method .",
    "a truncation of containing all the operators that are generated at one loop and that contributes to the flow of the local part of the four - point function of the scalar model is @xmath74   & = &   \\int \\!{\\rm d}^4x \\bigl\\{\\frac{z}{2 } \\left(\\del_\\mu\\varphi\\right)^2   + g_2 \\varphi^2   + g_4 \\varphi^4   + \\varphi^2 f_1(\\delta ) \\varphi^2   \\nonumber\\\\   & &   + g_6 \\varphi^6",

    "the notation for the second form factor @xmath77 is understood as follows : each laplacian @xmath78 acts only on the corresponding insertion @xmath79 and subsequently the limit @xmath80 has to be taken .",
    "the form factors @xmath76 resemble closely those of the nonlocal heat - kernel expansion @xcite and satisfy the boundary conditions @xmath81 and @xmath82 to have unambiguous definitions of @xmath83 and @xmath84 . all couplings and form factors",
    "implicitly encode the scale dependence @xmath2 which is driven by the flow . introducing the renormalized field @xmath85",
    ", we define anomalous dimension @xmath86 , dimensionless renormalized couplings @xmath87 , and form factors @xmath88 in momentum space @xmath89 inserting in we compute the frg beta function @xmath90 and @xmath86 , respectively , from the coefficient of the local part of the four - point function and the order @xmath91 of the two - point function with incoming momentum @xmath92 as outlined in @xcite . the leading result as a function of all other couplings is @xmath93 where we introduced a dimensionless momentum integration @xmath94 in @xmath95 , that is the natural argument of dimensionless renormalized propagator @xmath96 and derivative of the cutoff @xmath97 in momentum space .",
    "the results show that @xmath98 and @xmath86 only depend on the other dimensionless renormalized couplings as expected on dimensional grounds .",
    "the difference between and the universal results is that the former underlies a flow that requires the inclusion of potentially infinitely many couplings for consistency , while the latter depends solely on the coupling @xmath99 .",
    "this difference is the fundamental distinction of the frg and @xmath32 methods .",
    "while previously we found a dictionary to translate the couplings from one scheme to the other in the form of , we now seek for a consistent closure of within .",
    "one prescription is obtained first by computing the flow of all the couplings and form factors _ but _ @xmath100 , and then by setting them at the gaussian fixed point ( gfp ) as a function of @xmath100 .",
    "we call the one - dimensional submanifold of the theory space obtained in this way generalized gfp ( ggfp )",
    ". the curve is parametrized by @xmath100 and ends in the gfp when @xmath101 .",
    "we outline the method with two examples .",
    "the leading beta function of @xmath102 and its ggfp are @xmath103 and a similar structure holds for @xmath104 .",
    "form factors have flows that can be computed too and the ggfp conditions correspond to differential equations as illustrated from the @xmath105 example @xmath106 that can be solved with the method of characteristics @xmath107 a similar procedure can be carried over for the other form factor .",
    "it turns out that the ggfp values of the couplings are equivalent to those obtained by directly using the one loop eaa , thus implying that the bare theory underlying is actually massless .",
    "we now define the beta function and anomalous dimension of the papenbrock - wetterich scheme ( pw ) as the single - coupling beta function that is obtained inserting all the ggfp values in @xmath108 and similarly for @xmath86 .",
    "we adopt an exponential cutoff for the computation @xmath109 and move to the conventional normalization of the coupling @xmath110 .",
    "a new name was adopted for the coupling to underline that it belongs to a new scheme .",
    "the nested integrals appearing in can be solved analytically along the lines described in @xcite .",
    "the flow @xmath111 is two loops universal @xmath112 as seen by comparing with .",
    "the coupling @xmath113 , however , is not @xmath67 .",
    "in fact , with the techniques developed above we can compute at one loop @xmath114 with @xmath115 the euler - mascheroni constant . equation   differs from because of the cutoff and the absence of a bare mass that would affect starting from the order @xmath116 . the beta functions and will then differ from the order @xmath117 on , in agreement with the fact that three loop results are not universal . ] , and preserves the universality of .",
    "motivated by the desire of bridging a gap that exists between two powerful approaches to quantum field theory , we proved that the functional renormalization group flow equation admits a perturbative solution and showed explicitly that this solution can be related to the standard schemes of perturbation theory . as a reference technique for the perturbative computations we intentionally used the @xmath32 method , being the most well - known and applied technique in phenomenology .    in sec .",
    "[ sect2 ] we addressed the question of the scheme dependence in the @xmath71 approach , which was previously almost never addressed in the literature with very few exceptions , and provided a scheme transformation between the @xmath71 and @xmath32 methods .",
    "the transformation is shown to belong to the class of transformations that do not preserve universality of the beta functions , as we illustrated through the example of a simple scalar field in four dimensions , and holds in the overlapping region of validity of the @xmath71 and @xmath32 methods which correspond to the vicinity of a gaussian fixed point .",
    "the results of sec .",
    "[ sect2 ] are very similar in spirit to those of @xcite , where the kadanoff and wilson s blocking is investigated in the loop expansion and the relation between blocking and @xmath32 methods is obtained at one loop .",
    "in fact , the discussion made in @xcite on the limitations of the @xmath32 method and concerning the role of irrelevant operators can be motivated as well by the results of this paper .",
    "the results on the scheme change are expected to prove valuable when comparing observables of the phenomenologically more interesting yang - mills theories @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ sect3 ] we rigorously defined the pw scheme that restores universality of the beta functions in a frg setting .",
    "it is a nontrivial feature since the frg method is a mass - dependent scheme and therefore expected to violate two loop universality . in the pw scheme two loop universality",
    "is achieved by considering a truncation of the space of couplings that includes all operators that are perturbatively generated at one loop , and thus the method is reminiscent of the results of @xcite .",
    "our results thus help bridge a gap that exists between the methods that use truncations of the effective action , and those that renormalize perturbatively through the relevant deformations .",
    "the eaa appearing in sec .",
    "[ sect3 ] is thus a prototype for a truncation that is capable of providing two loops universal results when dealing with a renormalizable quantum field theory .",
