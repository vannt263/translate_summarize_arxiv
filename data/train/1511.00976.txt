    "the measurement s goal is to test a property of the system s preparation @xcite .",
    "however , one can consider more general settings , where the goal of the measurement is to test a property of a dynamical process .",
    "operationally , a test on a process is carried out by ( i ) preparing the input of the process in a known state ( possibly on an extended system ) , ( ii ) letting the state evolve through the process , and ( iii ) performing a measurement on the output . a device that performs the procedure ( i)-(iii )",
    "will be called a _ tester _ @xcite .    to introduce the notion of compatibility for testers ,",
    "it is useful to consider an example .",
    "imagine that we are given a black box , which transforms the polarization of photons , and that our goal is to find out some of its properties .",
    "one property is how the black box preserves the horizontal polarization : to test this property , we have to prepare a horizontally polarized photon and to perform a polarization measurement on the output .",
    "the probability that the measurement yields horizontal polarization is a measure of how well the black box preserves the horizontal polarization . however , this experiment gives no information on the preservation of the vertical polarization . to test how the vertical polarization is preserved",
    ", one would have to perform a similar experiment , preparing a vertically polarized photon as input and performing a polarization measurement on the output .",
    "now , a natural question is : are these two experiments compatible ?",
    "in other words , is there an experiment in which the preservation of both the horizontal and the vertical polarizations is investigated at the same time ?",
    "because of the orthogonality of the considered polarizations , it is natural to expect that both these features are compatible",
    ". in this particular case , the measurements of the output states are compatible .",
    "however , it is difficult to imagine how one could simultaneously prepare the input photon both horizontally and vertically polarized . intuitively , taking a superposition of horizontal and vertical polarization",
    "does not work in this case , because the action of the black box on the superposition does not give enough information about the action of the channel on the individual states that are superposed .",
    "later in the paper we will see that this intuition is correct and that the two testers described above are indeed incompatible .",
    "intuitively , the incompatibility of testers stems from the `` incompatibility '' of the states sent to the input and/or from the incompatibility of the quantum measurements performed on the output . in the example",
    "discussed above , the incompatibility of test states is the reason for incompatibility of process measurements ( the two testers ) .",
    "however , is the incompatibility of either of the constituents sufficient for the phenomenon of incompatibility in the sense of process measurements ? in this paper",
    "we will provide examples answering this question .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ sec : sec2 ] we will introduce the mathematical framework of process povms suited for the analysis of tester incompatibility questions .",
    "the section [ sec : sec3 ] introduces a measure of incompatibility of testers that is evaluated in section [ sec : incompfrompbs ] in cases when the incompatibility is rooted in the incompatibility of final measurements . in section [ sec : sec5 ] we will investigate in details the incompatibility of two - outcome testers , especially , we focus on factorized qubit case . in section [ sec : sec6 ] we will generalize the incompatibility consideration for general quantum networks and we will point out that the introduced incompatibility measure is bounded from below by success probability characterizing the minimum - error discrimination of corresponding quantum devices .",

    "in other words @xmath371 and we will see that the upper bound is achievable . in what follows",
    "we will formulate a lower bound in terms of normalization operators @xmath353 .",

    "we now relax this constraint and assume only that @xmath378 should be the operator of a quantum network of the desired type .",

    "in this paper we introduced the notion of incompatibility of quantum testers and we explored its basic properties .",
    "although there are many common features between the incompatibility of state and process measurements ( i.e. observables and testers ) , there are also fundamental differences .",
    "the first difference is that the commutativity of two testers does not imply their compatibility  even if the testers consist of orthogonal operators .",
    "this feature is in clear contrast with an elementary feature of incompatibility of quantum measurements ( observables ) , for which it is well known that commutativity implies compatibility .",
    "we have introduced the concept of orthogonality of testers that does not have any analogue in the framework of quantum observables . for observables ( unlike for testers )",
    "it can not happen that effects forming different observables are supported on mutually orthogonal subspaces .",
    "we have shown that any pair of orthogonal testers are commutative , but also maximally incompatible .",
    "in fact , all of them reach the maximal value of robustness , @xmath224 . and as they exist in any dimension , the maximal incompatibility is not only infinite dimensional phenomenon like in the case of observables @xcite .",
    "testers are always implementable as a state preparation on a system extended by an ancilla and subsequent measurement on the extended system .",
    "consider a pair of testers @xmath63 and @xmath64 with implementations @xmath392 and @xmath393 , hence , @xmath394 are used as test states and @xmath395 are the performed observables in implementations of @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : testerscheme ] ) . one could be tempted to determine compatibility of testers by their implementations , but these are not uniquely determined which usually makes such attempts futile .",
    "the only case , when the compatibility of testers can be deduced is when the states are the same and the measurements are compatible .",
    "on the other hand one can have two different implementations of the same tester with two different input states , which shows , that unequal input states do not imply ( in)compatibility of testers .",

    "@xmath400    in the light of previous discussion",
    "it is clear that the elements of testers , namely the preparation state and measurement , are not suitable for determining the testers incompatibility .",
    "in fact , we show one should look at the tester s normalizations and induced canonical observables . the incompatibility of normalizations of testers determines a lower bound on tester s incompatibility @xmath401 . for the special case of normalization compatible testers , the robustness of tester",
    "s incompatibility is upper bounded by the robustness of the associated canonical observables ( @xmath214 ) ( see section [ sec : incompfrompbs ] for details ) .    in conclusion , in order to verify the compatibility of testers it is necessary to verify that normalization states are compatible and also the associated canonical observables are compatible .",
    "we have investigated in details the compatibility of factorized qubit two - outcome testers .",

    "( [ eq : d ] ) we wanted to prove .",
    "since @xmath430 and @xmath431 , we can parameterize both povms by spectral decompositions of the effects @xmath432 , @xmath433 @xmath434 where @xmath435 $ ] and @xmath436 , @xmath437 are two orthonormal qubit bases .",
    "effects @xmath432 , @xmath433 as well as the corresponding povms can be convexly decomposed into four projective measurements ( extremal povms ) , @xmath438 where @xmath439 the decomposition in eq .",
    "( [ eq : defefconv ] ) is unique and such that @xmath440 the two outcome povms defined by effects @xmath441 , @xmath442 , @xmath443 , @xmath444 are trivial , i.e.  their outcomes can be generated without actually measuring the quantum state .",
    "the first pair and the second pair of povms defined by effects @xmath445 , @xmath446 , @xmath447 , @xmath448 are related by relabeling of outcomes ( e.g. @xmath449 , @xmath450 ) .",
    "we define @xmath268-testers @xmath451 where @xmath452 and @xmath453 .",
    "showing that all pairs of testers @xmath454 and @xmath455 ( for all @xmath456 , @xmath457 ) are @xmath102-compatible will be later used to show compatibility of 1-testers @xmath458 and @xmath459 .",
    "firstly , the outcomes of trivial povms can be generated without measuring the state , and so it is clear that those @xmath268-testers defined above that contain trivial povm will be @xmath102-compatible with @xmath102 obeying proposition [ prop : normalization ] with any other product @xmath268-tester @xmath460 .",
    "for example , for @xmath461 it would suffices to choose @xmath462 , @xmath463 and @xmath464 clearly , @xmath465 , @xmath466 and @xmath467 thus , for @xmath327 @xmath268-testers @xmath468 , @xmath469 are @xmath102-compatible , because either one of them contains trivial povm or the pair is unitarily equivalent to @xmath268-testers in proposition [ prop : achievinm ] .",

    "the fact that for @xmath323 @xmath268-testers @xmath468 , @xmath469 are @xmath102-compatible can be expressed using proposition [ prop : sdp ] by existence of operators @xmath471 satisfying @xmath472 let us note that @xmath473 @xmath474 , @xmath475 and since @xmath102 is given by the lower bound ( [ eq : minlforab ] ) also @xmath473 @xmath476 , @xmath477 and as a consequence the normalization of the joint tester @xmath195 is the same @xmath473 .",

    "we also easily get @xmath485 where we used ( [ eq : ineqgabab ] ) and ( [ eq : sumconvcoef ] ) .    finally , we use eq .",
    "( [ eq : ineqgabab ] ) to write @xmath486 which concludes the proof .",
    "proposition [ prop : sdp ] can be used to construct sdp for solving @xmath102-compatibility of two two - outcome testers @xmath254 and @xmath255 such that @xmath487 and @xmath488 . according to def .",
    "[ lambdacomp ] in @xmath102-compatibility we search for the smallest @xmath102 such that the testers @xmath489 and @xmath490 are compatible for some @xmath227 and @xmath228 .",
    "first of all , the necessary condition @xmath491 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ncnorm ] ) for the normalizations @xmath492 and @xmath493 needs to be satisfied .",
    "thus , in addition to search over operators @xmath293 , we have to expand the search also over the mixed - in elements @xmath494 , @xmath495 and their normalizations @xmath130 , @xmath131 . defining @xmath496",
    "the problem can be recast as the following bilinear sdp @xmath497=\\tr[\\tilde\\xi]=1 , \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last condition comes from the common normalization to @xmath195 .",
    "we can linearize the program by rescaling relevant operators by @xmath498 . using the definition of @xmath195 and setting @xmath499 , @xmath500 the sdp program can be equivalently stated as @xmath501=\\tr[\\tilde\\xi]=1 , \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the unknown objects are @xmath502 .",
