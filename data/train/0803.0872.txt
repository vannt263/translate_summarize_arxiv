    "such coincidence is explained by the same as in classical case , but a part of the average kinetic energy @xmath1 plays fermi energy , which we can understand as above - mentioned `` statistical potential '' too .      in order to explain the coincidence of the radii of cluster @xmath204 and polaron @xmath205 we can use hydrodynamical approach @xcite which lets to look at some general properties of system with coulomb type interaction under other point of view .",
    "let s consider the system of particle which is described be the persistent equation , euler equation and poisson equation (  +  for gravitating particles and  @xmath170  for interaction like electrical charges ) : @xmath212 we suppose that perturbations is adiabatical : @xmath213 , where @xmath214 - the speed of sound , @xmath215 - the small change of pressure .",
    "then the linearized equation of motion for fluctuation @xmath216 is @xmath217 where @xmath218 - jeans wave number .",
    "let s described localized oscillation process , when @xmath219 .",
    "then we have next solution :    * for the system with coulomb repulsion the dynamics of increase of the deflection has view @xmath220 , where @xmath221 .",
    "that is we have plasma oscillations .",
    "* for self - gravitation system the dynamics of increase of the deflection has view @xmath222 or @xmath223 , where @xmath221.that means exponential increase of the deflection or relaxation to the equilibrium state - cluster .",
    "we can see , that the both process is characterized by one and the same time scale @xmath224/ then we can suppose , that the correspond spatial scale is distant , which a particle cross in the process of its thermal motion at the time@xmath225 : @xmath226 this expression coincides with radiuses @xmath204 and @xmath205 for gravitating particles and repulsing particles accordingly . that is both aforesaid systems is characterized by one and the same sizes of spatial inhomogeneity .",
    "as it has been said above , the partition function of self - gravitational system divergences , however the states exist where the equilibrium spatial distribution function is solution of eq.([2.6 ] ) .",
    "this means that our system disintegrates ( collapses ) to infinity multitude of clusters of size @xmath129 each , since the number of particles in the system @xmath41 , but the number of the particles in the cluster is terminal .",
    "this multitude is self - gravitating system too and it may be collapse",
    ". then the process repeats again . in others",
    "words , the free anergy of the such system hasnt absolute minimum and each state of the self - gravitating system is analogous to false vacuum in theory of field @xcite .",
    "to evaluate of times of relaxation we can using eq.([3.13 ] ) .",
    "so with each act of collapse , we must substitute @xmath227 and @xmath228 , where @xmath229 is average number of particles in a cluster .",
    "then the time scale @xmath225 is constant at each process of cluster formation ( collapse ) .",
    "in this article , based on statistical approach @xcite , we demonstrated a nonperturbative calculation of the partition function , we solved the system of particles with boltzmann and fermi statistics with long - range interaction of coulomb type .",
    "all results have been obtained at the condition that average energy of interaction of two particles is much less than their average kinetic energy @xmath1 or fermi energy @xmath158 : @xmath161{v / n}}\\ll kt$ ] or @xmath161{v / n}}\\ll\\varepsilon_{f}$ ] - the `` local ideality '' approach @xcite .",
    "the long - range attraction of particles results to the formation of the cluster of finite size , as the initial homogeneous state is instable in the limit @xmath41 , @xmath42 with fixed @xmath43 .",
    "the equation for spatial distribution function has be obtained .",
    "however , it is simplified in the next limit cases only .    in case of large temperature ( when @xmath230{\\upsilon}$ ] ) the radius of cluster is determined by balance of the two energies : the energy of attraction interaction which aspires to compress gas , and the thermal energy which creates a positive pressure .",
    "this mechanism created equilibrium distribution in the the system ( [ 2.7 ] ) , in particular , with rising of temperature the cluster s size enlarges and its central density decreases accordingly . in the case of degenerated system the radius of the cluster",
    "is determined by balance of the two energy too : energy of interaction which aspires to compress gas , and repulsive fermi statistical potential creating positive pressure . in the total case",
    "the equilibrium cluster s size determined by three energy : energy of interaction , thermal and repulsive `` statistical potential '' .",
    "the size of the cluster approaches to the equilibrium size asymptotically in process of its formation .",
    "the state of the system with spatially inhomogeneous distribution corresponding to the cluster of the equilibrium size ( [ 2.28b ] or [ 2.29 ] ) is stable if we are assuming that `` local ideality '' approach is true .",
    "the size of spatial inhomogeneity of two matter : gravitating gas and repulsing particles ( by coulomb ) is coincides at one and the same interaction s constant in boltzmann limit and degenerated case .",
    "this coincidence caused by that , that the spatial distributions in both cases is determined by the two energies only : coulomb type and thermal energy or repulsive fermi  statistical potential  .",
    "the mechanism of formation of the cluster and the polaron is one and the same - a balance of they two energies .",
    "this fact can be explained by hydrodynamical approach - both matters have same time scale of structure s formation , but in the first matter it determines time of relaxation and in the second matter it determines of plasma oscillation .",
    "this time scales determine spatial scale ( the radii of the cluster and the polaron ) monotonously .",
    "let s obtain some expressions used in this paper for ideal fermi and bose gas .",
    "thus we ll demonstrate the correctness and greater rationality of our approach as compared with the traditional method @xcite .    in the case of ideal gas @xmath231 .",
    "then the effective free energy ( [ 1.3 ] ) for the system is    @xmath232    where @xmath233 is special fermi function @xcite ; @xmath234 is kinetic energy of a particle ; @xmath48 is wave s thermal length of a particle .",
    "then the equation for saddle point is as follows : @xmath235 where @xmath236 , @xmath237 .",
    "the partition function ( [ 1.2 ] ) for this case : @xmath238 , \\label{a3}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is determined from the equation ( [ a2 ] ) .",
    "we can find any thermodynamical functions knowing the partition function .",
    "let s consider the case @xmath57 corresponding to high temperature ( the boltzmann limit ) , then eqs .",
    "( [ a2],[a3 ] ) are reduced to @xmath239 \\approx\\frac{v^{n}}{n!}\\left(\\frac{mkt}{2\\pi\\hbar^{2}}\\right)^{\\frac{3}{2}n}\\label{a6}\\\\ \\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{1}{v}=\\frac{\\xi}{\\lambda^{3}}\\label{a7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    let s consider the case @xmath177 corresponding to degenerated fermi gas .",
    "then the special fermi functions are @xcite @xmath240+o(\\xi^{-1})\\nonumber\\\\ f_{5/2}=\\frac{4}{3\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\left[\\frac{2}{5}(\\ln\\xi)^{5/2}+\\frac{\\pi^{2}}{4}(\\ln\\xi)^{1/2}\\right]+o(\\xi^{-1}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this case , the expression ( [ a2 ] ) is reduced to @xmath241 where @xmath242 is fermi energy .",
    "we can find analogical expressions for bose gas .",
    "it is necessary to proceed from the effective free energy as @xmath243 where @xmath244 - special bose function @xcite .",
    "it is clear that activity always @xmath245 unlike fermi system ; @xmath246 is effective free energy for condensed phase ( the addendum with @xmath247 is as important as the rest of the sum when @xmath248 )",
    ".    let s find the internal energy @xmath249 of the system proceeding from the arranged analogy between apparatus of thermodynamics in our representation and the theory of field .",
    "in order to do it let s use the correlation @xmath250 and determine conformities @xmath251 , where @xmath252 is hamilton s function of the system , @xmath253 and @xmath254 are the action for mechanics and effective free energy for thermodynamics ( [ 1.3 ] ) systems correspondingly , @xmath255 is time and @xmath256 is reverse temperature . then , with the help of the expression ( [ 2.1 ] ) , we have @xmath257    thus the expressions for thermodynamical function of fermi and bose gases obtained by our method coincide with ones obtained by usual way @xcite , and it confirms the correctness of the proposed approach ."
