    "the stability of a relativistic star against collapse to black hole is one of the most important predictions of general relativity .",
    "while this problem is reasonably well understood for nonrotating stars  @xcite , this is not the case for rotating stars and is particularly obscure when the stars are rapidly rotating .",
    "a milestone in this landscape is the criterion for secular stability proposed by friedman , ipser and sorkin ( 1988 ) , who proved that a sequence of uniformly rotating barotropic stars is secularly unstable on one side of a turning point ( an extremum of mass along a sequence of constant angular momentum , or an extremum of angular momentum along a sequence of constant rest - mass ) .",
    "they then argued , based on an expectation that viscosity leads to uniform rotation , that the turning point should identify the onset of secular instability . while for nonrotating star the turning point coincides with the secular - instability point ( and with the dynamical - instability point for a barotropic star if the perturbation satisfies the same equation of state of the equilibrium model ) , for rotating stars it is only a sufficient condition for a secular instability .",
    "lacking other guides , the turning point is routinely used to find a dynamical instability in simulations  @xcite .",
    "our understanding of the dynamical instability of relativistic stars in uniform rotation can be improved by determining the neutral - stability line , that is the set of stellar models whose frequency of the fundamental mode of quasi - radial oscillation ( @xmath0 mode ) is vanishingly small .",
    "while this problem is challenging from a perturbative point of view , especially when the rate of rotation becomes high , it can be tackled through numerical calculations .",
    "we have therefore simulated in full general relativity @xmath1 stellar models and calculated accurately the corresponding @xmath0-mode frequency via a novel analysis of the power spectral density ( psd ) of the central rest - mass density .",
    "this new approach has been validated through a comparison with all the available data , showing excellent agreement and , most importantly , a much smaller variance . by construction ,",
    "in fact , simulations can not evolve models at ( or near ) the neutral - stability line , but the accuracy of our @xmath0-mode frequencies and their smooth dependence on the central rest - mass density and dimensionless rotation rate , have allowed us to produce an analytic fit of the data and deduce from this the neutral - stability line .",
    "we find in this way that it coincides with the turning point for spherical stars , but not for rotating stars , with the difference increasing with the angular momentum .",
    "although somewhat surprising , this difference is not in contrast with the predictions of the turning - point criterion , since the latter is only a sufficient condition for secular instability and not a necessary condition for secular and dynamical instability .",
    "hence , a stellar model which is stable according to the turning - point criterion , can be nevertheless dynamical unstable .    to test the new stability line and validate whether it can be used to mark the threshold for dynamical stability",
    ", we have evolved stellar models whose properties fall in a small region near the two stability lines .",
    "special attention has been paid to stellar models that are predicted to be stable by the turning - point criterion but unstable by the neutral - stability line .",
    "because these model indeed collapse to black holes , we conclude that the neutral - stability line can be used effectively to mark the boundary to dynamical instability .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : method_and_model ] describes the numerical setup and initial data , while sect .",
    "[ sec : method_accuracy ] presents our approach to extract the eigenfrequency and offers comparisons with previous work .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] collects our results and a comparison between the two stability criteria , leaving the conclusions to sect .",
    "[ sec : summary ] . unless stated differently , we use units in which @xmath2 .",
    "all of our calculations have been performed in full general relativity ( gr ) using the ` whisky2d ` code described in detail in  @xcite .",
    "this is a 2-dimensional ( 2d ) code based on the 3-dimensional ( 3d ) ` whisky ` code  @xcite , and exploiting the condition of axisymmetry through the `` cartoon '' method  @xcite .",
    "in essence , the evolution of the spacetime is obtained using the 2d version of ` ccatie ` , a finite - differencing code providing the solution of a conformal traceless formulation of the einstein equations  @xcite , while the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics are solved a flux - conservative formulation of the equations , as first discussed in detail in  @xcite .",
    "the whisky2d code implements a variety of approximate riemann solvers and several reconstruction methods and , as discussed in  @xcite , the use of reconstruction schemes of order high enough is fundamental for an accurate evolution .",
    "in particular , the results presented here have been computed using the piecewise - parabolic reconstruction method(ppm )  @xcite , the hlle approximate riemann solver  @xcite , and a 3rd - order runge - kutta method for the time evolution .",
    "the initial equilibrium stellar models are built using the ` rns ` code  @xcite as isentropic , uniformly rotating relativistic perfect - fluid polytropes with equation of state @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the pressure , @xmath5 the rest - mass density , @xmath6 the polytropic constant , @xmath7 the polytropic exponent , and @xmath8 the energy density .",
    "although all the results can be rescaled for any choice of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , we have here set @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which yield stars with maximum gravitational mass is @xmath11 for a nonrotating star and @xmath12 for a uniformly rotating one .",
    "the ` rns ` code provides an equilibrium solution in spherical polar coordinates after specifying for each stellar model a central density @xmath13 and a equatorial and polar ( coordinate ) radii in a ratio @xmath14 .",
    "once this solution is found , it is mapped to a cartesian grid of ` whisky2d ` and used as initial data for the subsequent evolution .",
    "attention needs to be paid that the resolution in the calculation of the initial data matches well the one used in the evolution .",
    "we have verified that a resolution of @xmath15 [ @xmath16 , with @xmath17 the number of points of the radial and angular grids of the ` rns ` code , are needed for an accurate evolution in the high [ low]-resolution setup of the ` whisky2d ` code .",
    "furthermore , because we are not interested here in extracting gravitational - wave information , we place the outer boundary at a few stellar radii and use a uniform grid with spacing @xmath18 ranging between @xmath19 for the rapidly rotating models and up to @xmath20 for the slowly rotating ones . as done in  @xcite , we stagger the grid in the @xmath21-direction of half a cell .",
    "a large number of tests have been carried out to verify that the results do not depend on the position of the outer boundary , or on the value of the density in the atmosphere ( see  @xcite ) , which we set to be @xmath22 orders of magnitude smaller than the central one .    as discussed by many authors  @xcite ,",
    "the truncation error in the initial data is sufficient to trigger perturbations in the star , which will start to oscillate in a number of eigenmodes .",
    "however , because we need to determine the eigenfrequency of the @xmath0 mode , it is important that as much as possible of the initial perturbation energy goes into exciting that mode .",
    "for this reason we introduce an initial perturbation using the eigenfunction of the @xmath0 mode for a nonrotating neutron star with the same central density , and which can be computed from linear perturbation theory .",
    "more specifically , denoting with @xmath23 any fluid quantity of the nonrotating model with the same central density and with @xmath24 the corresponding eigenfunction with @xmath25 the radial coordinate in isotropic coordinate system , we as approximate equivalent eigenfunction for a rotating star in a coordinate system @xmath26 as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the radius of the nonrotating star and @xmath29 that of the rotating star , which will obviously depend on the angle @xmath30 . as a result",
    ", the power in the initial perturbation is mostly concentrated in the @xmath0 mode , whose corresponding peak in the psd of any hydrodynamical quantity is larger by at least a factor @xmath31 than any other mode . as an additional validation of the procedure ,",
    "we have computed the numerical eigenfunction for some selected models and verified that it matches very well the guessed one even in the case of rapidly rotating stars and long - term evolutions .",
    "as customary , we extract the @xmath0-mode frequency by performing a discrete fourier transform of the evolution of a representative hydrodynamical quantity , such as the central rest - mass density @xmath32 , and by inspecting the corresponding psd . defining as @xmath33 the frequency of the largest peak in the numerical psd , previous studies determined the value of the @xmath0-mode frequency , @xmath0 , by fitting the psd with a known analytic function [ _ e.g. , _  a lorentzian ,  @xcite ] or by taking the derivative of the psd  @xcite .",
    "the frequency obtained in these ways depends sensitively on the fitting function used , on the shape of the psd around @xmath33 , and on the evolution time @xmath34 .",
    "we here use a different approach .",
    "because @xmath33 will tend to @xmath0 as the evolution time @xmath35 , we simply consider the evolution of @xmath33 for increasingly large values of @xmath34 .",
    "what we find in this way is that @xmath36 is an oscillating function around @xmath0 , whose amplitude is however bounded by two envelopes which have a clear @xmath37 dependence .",
    "fitting for these envelopes and extrapolating for @xmath35 we obtain a very accurate and possibly optimal value for @xmath0 .",
    "as we will discuss in the following section , this approach turns out to give an excellent measure of the @xmath0-mode eigenfrequency and we recommend it in all those studies aimed at determining eigenfrequencies of relativistic stars .",
    "the @xmath0-mode frequency of spherical stars can be computed to arbitrary precision within a linear perturbative approach ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "hence , as a first validation of the accuracy of our procedure we have estimated the @xmath0-mode frequency for @xmath38 nonrotating models with @xmath39 ; in this range the @xmath0 mode first grows , then reaches a maximum , and finally decreases to zero at the secular - instability point , around @xmath40 . defining the relative error as @xmath41 / ( f)^2_{_{\\mathrm{pt}}}$ ] , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are respectively the frequencies of the @xmath0 mode from perturbation theory and from our simulation .",
    "the relative error is extremely small at low densities ( _ e.g. , _",
    "@xmath44 for @xmath45 ) and it increases with the density ( _ e.g. , _  @xmath46 for @xmath47 ) , becoming of the order of about @xmath48 at the edge of the secular instability .",
    "this is obviously due to the fact that as @xmath49 , numerical calculations become increasingly long and inaccurate .",
    "-mode frequencies with those of previous works in either perturbation theory ( pt ) , the cfc approximation  @xcite , the cowling approximation  @xcite , or in full gr  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : comparison___full_vs_cfc_vs_cowling],width=283 ]    we next compare our numerical estimates for the @xmath0-mode frequency with those made in several different approaches and approximations , using as reference a central rest - mass density , as this is the one most commonly used .",
    "we start our comparison by considering the case of nonrotating stars , for which results are available from works of  @xcite in either the conformally - flat condition ( cfc ) , or of  @xcite in full gr .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison___full_vs_cfc_vs_cowling ] , which reports the @xmath0-mode frequency as a function of the dimensionless ratio @xmath50 between the rotational kinetic energy @xmath51 and the binding energy @xmath52 .",
    "note that the frequency is reported in two different scales , referring to simulations either in full gr / cfc ( left scale ) or in the cowling approximation ( right scale ) , which systematically yields larger frequencies .",
    "although the cfc ( blue crosses ) for a nonrotating should give the same frequency in full gr ( magenta filled triangles and red crosses ) and in perturbation theory ( black filled circle ) , fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison___full_vs_cfc_vs_cowling ] shows that this is not quite the case , although the differences are only of @xmath53 .",
    "considerably larger are instead the differences with the frequencies in the cowling approximation , which are larger of a factor of @xmath54 ( green stars and light - blued filled squares ) .",
    "clearly , the difference between the results in full gr and the perturbative ones is much smaller and indeed the one with our new results is the smallest among all the data available .",
    "we also note that our results also report the estimated error bars , which are much smaller than the size of the symbols .    considering next the comparison also for rotating stars , it is easy to see that our results in two dimensions match well those in three dimensions of  @xcite for the rotation rates available and obviously have smaller error bars .",
    "the very good match with the results in the cfc  @xcite , with differences of a few percent only for all the values of @xmath55 , confirms the conclusions drawn by  @xcite , that the cfc is a very good approximation , at least for the dynamics of isolated stars .",
    "figure  [ fig : comparison___full_vs_cfc_vs_cowling ] also shows that the comparison with frequencies computed in the cowling approximation  @xcite is considerably worse . besides an intrinsic difference between the two sets of data ( the frequencies of  @xcite are agreement only within the error bars of  @xcite ) , the rate of change of the frequencies with @xmath55 differs from the one found in full gr , being less rapid for the latter ( this is not evident because the figure has two different vertical scales )",
    "this comparison shows the cowling approximation to be inaccurate for all rotation rates .    in summary , this comparison validates our approach , highlighting its accuracy and smoothness when compared to alternative methods . this will be essential to find the neutral - stability line .",
    "as mentioned above , the space of parameters is spanned by central rest - mass density and the angular momentum of the rotating models . to cover the largest possible region of parameters",

    "@xmath59 $ ] .",
    "-mode frequencies ( blue filled circles ) as a function of @xmath13 and @xmath55 .",
    "the dashed green area shows models above the mass - shedding limit , and the red solid line marks the neutral stability ( _ cf .  _",

    "a solid magenta line is the analytic fitting of the frequency for nonrotating stars , while dashed blue lines show sequences of rotating stars having the same rest - mass density .",
    "all models simulated have nonzero @xmath0-mode frequencies and their number diminishes for @xmath61 . as mentioned above , this is because for these models the oscillation timescale tends to become extremely large ( diverging for @xmath62 ) , thus becoming intractable in numerical simulations .",
    "in addition , models near the neutral point could also be artificially induced to collapse simply by the accumulation of the truncation error ( see also  @xcite ) , thus preventing any reliable measure . as a result",
    ", our analysis has been constrained to values of the frequencies @xmath63 .",
    "fortunately , however , the quality of the data and the smoothness in which they appear in fig .",
    "[ fig : f_surface2d3d_unirot_polyk100g2 ] , allow us to compute an analytic fit of the function @xmath64 and thus determine analytically the neutral - stability line where @xmath65 .",
    "it is convenient to use a fitting function @xmath66 that is linear in @xmath55 and such that by construction @xmath67 where @xmath68 are constant coefficients , which a least - square fitting with the data reveals to be @xmath69 a confirmation of the accuracy of the ansatz ( [ eq : empirical ] ) comes from the very small variance of a comparison with perturbative results for nonrotating stars .",
    "considering in fact over @xmath70 stellar models with @xmath71 , @xmath72 $ ] , we obtain @xmath73 .",
    "similarly , when comparing over the whole set of numerical data we find a variance that , as expected , is greater for large values of @xmath13 and @xmath55 but that , overall , is @xmath74 . note that these errors are smaller or at most comparable with the numerical error bar , highlighting the quality of the fit .",
    "using expression ( [ eq : empirical ] ) , it is straightforward to compute the neutral - stability line in a @xmath75 plane as the one at which @xmath76 . of course this line will be `` thickened '' by the uncertainty associated to the fit which",

    "the blue dashed line is instead the turning - point criterion for secular stability .",
    "marked with empty or filled circles are representative models with constant angular velocity ` o1 ` , ` o2 ` , ` o3 ` , or constant initial central rest - mass density ` r1 ` , ` r2 ` , ` r3 ` .",
    "[ fig : stable_line],width=283 ]    clearly , the new neutral - stability criterion does coincide with the turning - point criterion for nonrotating stars ( _ cf .",
    "_ small inset ) , but it differs from it as the angular momentum is increased , moving to smaller central rest - mass densities . while unexpected , this difference does not point to a conflict between the two criteria .",
    "this is because the turning - point criterion is only a _ sufficient _ condition for secular instability of rotating stars ; stated differently , while a rotating stellar model which is at or to the right of the turning - point line is expected to be also secular unstable , the opposite is not true .",
    "hence , the two criteria are compatible as long as the secular instability line lies to the left ( _ i.e. , _  for smaller central rest - mass densities ) of the neutral - stability line .",
    "determining the secular - stability line requires to consider a dissipative mechanism such as viscosity , which is however absent in our perfect - fluid description and difficult to introduce within a fully relativistic hyperbolic description .",
    "however , because a dynamically unstable model should also be secularly unstable , we in fact expect the secular stability line to coincide or to be on the left of the neutral - stability line .",
    "in other words , along a @xmath82 sequence of stellar models we expect the following order with increasing rest - mass density : secular instability , dynamical instability , turning - point .    to validate that the neutral - stability line should be used in place of the turning - point line to distinguish stellar models that are dynamically unstable from those that are instead stable , we have considered @xmath83 representative models whose properties fall in a small region near the two stability lines . more specifically , we consider two different sequences having either constant angular velocity , _ i.e. , _  models ` o1 ` , ` o2 ` , ` o3 ` in fig .",
    "[ fig : stable_line_confirm ] , or constant @xmath13 ,",
    "_ i.e. , _  models ` r1 ` , ` r2 ` , ` r3 ` .",
    "the predictions for these models are different according to which criterion is used for stability .",
    "in fact , while models ` o1 ` , ` r1 ` are expected to be stable for both criteria and models ` o3 ` , ` r3 ` are expected to be unstable for both criteria , models ` o2 ` , ` r2 ` are predicted to be stable on a dynamical timescale by the turning - point criterion but unstable by the neutral - stability criterion .     for models with constant angular velocity ( upper panel ) or constant initial central rest - mass density ( lower panel ) .",
    "an exponential growth signals the collapse to black hole ( _ cf .  _",
    "[ fig : stable_line ] ) .",
    "[ fig : stable_line_confirm],width=283 ]    to test these predictions we have evolved these configurations maintaining the same computational setup ( but without an initial perturbation ) and collected the corresponding evolution of the central rest - mass density in fig .  [ fig : stable_line ] .",
    "as expected , models ` o1 ` , ` r1 ` are found to be stable over about @xmath84 as indicated by the central rest - mass density that remains constant ( modulo the @xmath0-mode oscillations ) , while models ` o3 ` , ` r3 ` are found to collapse to black holes in less than @xmath85 as indicated by the exponential increase of the rest - mass density ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , models ` o2 ` , ` r2 ` are also found to collapse to black holes over a timescale which is only slightly larger than that of models ` o3 ` , ` r3 ` . after validating that these results do not depend on the specific numerical setup used ( _ e.g. , _",
    "placement of outer boundaries , resolution or density in the atmosphere ) , we conclude that the neutral - stability line can indeed be used to mark the boundary of a dynamically unstable region .",
    "the stability of rotating relativistic stars against gravitational collapse to black hole is an old problem in general relativity , impacting all those astrophysical problems where a neutron star may be produced and induced to collapse as a result of mass accretion . despite the importance of this problem ,",
    "no analytic a criterion is known for a dynamical stability of rotating stars .",
    "important progress was made about @xmath86 years ago , when a criterion for secular stability was proposed by  @xcite , who suggested that a turning point along a sequence of stellar models with constant angular momentum can be associated with the onset of a secular instability .",
    "although this criterion is only a sufficient condition for the development of a secular instability , it has been systematically used to limit the region of dynamical instability in simulations of relativistic stars  @xcite .    to improve our understanding of the dynamical instability of relativistic stars in uniform rotation ,",

    "although our simulations can not evolve models near the neutral - stability line , the high accuracy of our estimates for the eigenfrequencies ( which have been validated through a comparison with all the available data ) and their regular dependence on the central rest - mass density and dimensionless rotation rate , have allowed us to produce an analytic fit of the data and deduce from this the neutral - stability line .",
    "the latter coincides with the turning - point line of  @xcite for nonrotating stars , but differs from it as the angular momentum is increased , being located at smaller central rest - mass densities as the angular momentum is increased .",
    "this difference does not contradict turning - point criterion since the latter is only a sufficient condition for secular instability .    to test this result",
