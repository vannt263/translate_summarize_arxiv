    "will be called the _ weight _ of the edge - discriminator and shall be denoted by @xmath21 .",
    "an edge - discriminator @xmath7 on @xmath2 is said to be an _",

    "henceforth , the weight of the optimal edge - discriminator on @xmath2 , that is , @xmath23 , will be denoted by @xmath24 .    in this paper",
    "we prove several properties of hypergraph edge - discriminators and explicitly compute optimal edge - discriminators in some special types of hypergraphs .",
    "hypergraph vertex labelings such that the sum of the labels of the vertices along the edges are mutually distinct , has been studied in the literature in many different contexts .",
    "one of them is the notion of anti - magic labeling on graphs . in general ,",
    "graph labeling is an assignment of integers to the vertices or edges , or both , of a graph which satisfy certain conditions .",
    "refer to the survey of gallian @xcite for a comprehensive view into the colossal literature in graph labeling . for a graph @xmath25 an _ edge - antimagic vertex labeling _ @xmath26 is a injective function such that the quantities @xmath27 are mutually distinct , whenever @xmath28 is an edge in @xmath29 .",
    "edge - antimagic vertex labeling was studied by wood @xcite .",
    "later bollobs and pikhurko @xcite defined the _ sum magic number _ of a graph @xmath30 , denoted by @xmath31 , as the smallest value of the largest vertex label in an edge - antimagic vertex labeling .",
    "they proved that @xmath32 and @xmath33 whenever @xmath34 , where @xmath35 .",
    "note that , unlike in the case of edge - discriminators , edge anti - magic vertex labeling on a graph is an injective function .",
    "moreover , the sum magic number minimizes the maximum label , and not the the sum of the labels as required in the optimal edge - discriminator .",
    "another relevant line of research involves the notion of irregular networks .",
    "a _ network _ is a simple graph where each edge is assigned a positive integer weight .",
    "the _ degree _ of a vertex in a network is the sum of the weights of its incident edges .",
    "a network is _ irregular _ if all the vertices have distinct degrees .",
    "the strength of a network is the maximum weight assigned to any edge .",
    "the irregularity strength of a graph @xmath29 is the minimum strength among all irregular network on @xmath29 , and is denoted by @xmath36 .",
    "the notion of irregularity strength was first introduced by chartrand et al .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that for any given graph @xmath29 , @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the number of vertices of degree @xmath39 .",
    "if @xmath29 contains a @xmath40 or multiple isolated vertices , the irregularity strength @xmath41 .",
    "nierhoff @xcite proved a tight bound @xmath42 , for graphs @xmath29 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "faudree and lehel @xcite proved bounds on the irregularity strength of @xmath45-regular graphs .",
    "upper bounds on the irregularity strength for general graphs in terms of the minimum degree was first given by frieze et al .",
    "@xcite , and later by przybyo @xcite and kalkowski et al .",
    "however , computing the irregularity strength of a graph exactly is difficult in general",
    ". it is known only for some very special graphs and in almost all of these cases , it is found to be within an additive constant of @xmath46 .",
    "it was conjectured by lehel @xcite , that @xmath36 is within an additive constant of @xmath46 for connected graphs .",
    "this has been verified for some special families of graphs like , complete graphs @xcite , cycles , most complete bipartite graphs , turan graphs @xcite , wheels , hypercubes , and grids @xcite .",
    "the problem of studying the irregularity strength was extended for hypergraphs by gyrfs et al .",
    "edge - discriminators on hypergraphs and irregular networks are dual concepts .",
    "for a hypergraph @xmath0 , the _ dual hypergraph _ is defined as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the set of all edges in @xmath11 which are incident on @xmath51 .",
    "note that if @xmath52 is an irregular edge assignment for @xmath2 , then @xmath53 transforms to an edge - discriminator @xmath54 on @xmath55 as follows : for every vertex @xmath56 , let @xmath57 be the corresponding hyperedge in @xmath2 and define @xmath58 .",
    "however , the most important difference between irregularity strength of a hyper graph and the optimal edge - discriminator in the dual hypergraph is the optimization criterion . in the case of irregularity strength the maximum label",
    "is minimized , whereas we minimize the sum of the labels in the optimal edge - discriminator .",
    "another difference is that in an irregular network , the value assigned to an edge is always positive , which means that the edge - discriminator in the corresponding hypergraph assigns a positive weight to every vertex , which is not required in the definition of an edge - discriminator .",
    "another related line of work exists in the context of the power set hypergraph .",
    "the _ power set hypergraph _ on a set @xmath18 , with @xmath59 , is the hypergraph @xmath60 , where @xmath61 denotes the set of all non - empty subsets of @xmath18 .",
    "note that any edge - discriminator on the power set hypergraph is a set of positive integers such that all its non - empty subsets have distinct sums .",
    "a set of positive numbers satisfying this property is called _ sum - distinct_. a sum - distinct set of @xmath62 elements with the minimum total sum is the optimal edge - discriminator on the power set hypergraph .",
    "this can be easily computed as we shall show in section [ sec : power_set ] . in 1931",
    "erds asked for estimates of smallest possible value of the largest element in a sum - distinct set of @xmath62 elements , which we denote by @xmath63 .",
    "erds offered 500 dollars for verifying whether @xmath64 , and guy @xcite made the stronger conjecture that @xmath65 . in 1955 erds and moser proved that @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "the constant was later improved by elkies @xcite , which was further improved by aliev @xcite .",
    "a set consisting of the first @xmath62 powers of 2 has distinct subset sums , and has maximal element @xmath67 , which implies that @xmath68 .",
    "conway and guy @xcite found a construction of sum - distinct sets which gave an interesting upper bound on @xmath63 .",
    "this was later improved by lunnon @xcite and then by bohman @xcite , who showed that @xmath69 for sufficiently large @xmath62 .      in this paper",
    "we study edge - discriminators on hypergraphs such that the sum of the labels of the vertices is minimized .",
    "we begin by proving a general upper bound on the weight of an edge - discriminator , which holds for any hypergraph .",
    "the bound is relatively simple to obtain , but it is tight .    for any hypergraph @xmath0 , with @xmath9 , @xmath70 , and equality holds if and only if the elements of @xmath11 are mutually disjoint .",

    "moreover , there is a hypergraph which attains this lower bound .",
    "however , like the irregularity strength , finding the optimal edge - discriminators is generally difficult even for very special hypergraphs .",
    "nevertheless , we were able to obtain optimal edge - discriminators for some specific hypergraphs , which include paths , cycles and the complete bipartite graph .",

    "this motivates us to ask the following question : given any integer @xmath94 $ ] , whether there exists a hypergraph @xmath2 with @xmath16 hyperedges such that @xmath95 is the weight of the optimal edge - discriminator on @xmath2 .",
    "we show that the answer is no , by proving the following theorem :    there exists no hypergraph @xmath0 , with @xmath14 , such that the weight of the optimal edge - discriminator on @xmath2 is @xmath96 .",

    "in this section , we shall give an algorithm for constructing an edge - discriminator for a general hypergraph , using which we shall prove theorem [ th : hypergraph_main ] .",

    "geometric set discrimination problems have potential applications in unique image indexing in large database @xcite , where the emphasis is specially given on deciding whether a particular image exists in the database , rather than on finding the similarity matches of the given image .",
    "a novel method for image indexing using only the number of connected components , the number of holes , and the euler number of an image was proposed by biswas et al .",
    "@xcite . a _ connected component _ of a digital binary image is a subset of maximal size such that any two of its pixels can be joined by a connected curve , in 8-connectivity , lying entirely in the subset . a _ hole _ in a digital image is a region of the background , which is a connected component in 4-connectivity and is completely enclosed by the object .",
    "the _ euler number _ of an image is defined as the number of connected components minus the number of holes in the image . if @xmath561 and @xmath562 denote the number of connected components and the number of holes in a digital image , respectively , then its euler number @xmath563 @xcite .",
    "the ordered pair @xmath564 is called the _",
    "euler pair _ of a digital image .",
    "it is apparent that two or more images may have the same value of the euler pair , and hence this feature alone often can not uniquely characterize an image in a large database .",
    "one way to disambiguate the features is to deploy a mask image @xcite as follows : we assume that each image is given as a @xmath565 binary pixel matrix .",
    "let us consider @xmath16 images @xmath566 , each having the same euler pair .",
    "in order to discriminate them , another binary image @xmath525 called mask is to be constructed such that the euler pair of the @xmath16 images @xmath567 are mutually distinct , where @xmath568 denotes bitwise boolean operation , like xor or and between the corresponding bits of the two pixel matrices .     +    as it turns out , finding a simple mask of a given set of images is a challenging problem .",
    "biswas et al .",
    "@xcite provided an iterative heuristic based on few synthetic pseudo - random masks .",
    "we now show that finding a mask for a set of images can be modeled as an instance of the hypergraph edge - discrimination for a collection of geometric regions in @xmath527 .",
    "consider the images @xmath566 , superimposed on each other in the same frame , as subsets of @xmath527 .",
    "suppose @xmath525 is a geometric discriminator for this collection of regions .",
    "then the binary image corresponding to @xmath525 is a mask for the set of images under the bitwise boolean and operation .",
    "the process is illustrated with 4 binary images in the figure [ fig : image_indexing ] .",
    ", the mask @xmath525 should be a subset of @xmath569 . as a result",
    ", several technical difficulties may arise while trying to obtain a geometric discriminator for a set of binary images containing holes .",
    "these problems need to be handled separately and they are not of interest to this paper . here",
    "we use the unique indexing problem just as a motivation for the edge - discrimination problem on hypergraphs . ]",
    "the mask corresponding to the optimal geometric discriminator is the simplest in the sense that the pixel matrix has the least number of ones .",
    "in this paper we introduce the notion of hypergraph edge - discrimination and study its properties .",
    "we have shown that given any hypergraph @xmath0 , with @xmath59 and @xmath9 , @xmath70 , and the equality holds if and only if the elements of @xmath11 are mutually disjoint . for @xmath12-uniform hypergraphs , using properties of @xmath74-sets , we prove that @xmath77 , and the bound is attained by a complete @xmath12-uniform hypergraph up to a constant factor .    moreover , it is easy to see that for any hypergraph @xmath0 and any edge - discriminator @xmath19 on @xmath2 , @xmath570 , where @xmath9 and @xmath79 is the size of the maximum matching in @xmath2 .",
    "this motivated us to consider the question of attainability of weights : given any integer @xmath94 $ ] , we ask whether there exists a hypergraph @xmath431 with @xmath16 hyperedges such that the weight of the optimal edge - discriminator on @xmath431 is @xmath95 .",
    "we answer this question in the negative by proving that there exists no hypergraph on @xmath571 hyperedges such that the weight of the optimal edge - discriminator is @xmath96 .",
    "the problem of attainability of weights appears to be a very interesting problem which might lead to surprising consequences .",
    "computing optimal edge - discriminators for special hypergraphs are also interesting combinatorial problems .",
    "we have computed the optimal edge - discriminators for paths , cycles , and the complete @xmath12-partite hypergraph .",
    "finding optimal edge - discriminators appear to be quite difficult even for very simple graphs , in particular if the graph is not regular .",
