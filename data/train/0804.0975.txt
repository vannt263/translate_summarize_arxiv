    "perhaps the most surprising finding in the search for extrasolar planets is the discovery of short - period ( @xmath0 week ) jupiter - mass ( @xmath1 ) companions around solar - type main sequence stars ( mayor & queloz 1995 , marcy et al .",
    "2000 ) . among the inventory of @xmath2200",
    "presently - known extrasolar planets , 20% have @xmath3 days .",
    "nearly 20 short - period planets have measured radii ( @xmath4 ) that are comparable to or larger than that of jupiter ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "while these information may be biazed because of observational selection effects , these planets are most probably gas giants .    according to the conventional sequential - accretion scenario ( pollack _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) , the most likely birth place for gas giant planets is just outside the snow line where volatile heavy elements can condense and coagulate into large planet building blocks ( ida & lin 2004 ) . in protostellar disks with comparable surface density ( @xmath6 ) ,",
    "metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) , and temperature ( @xmath7 ) distributions as those of minimum mass nebula model ( hayashi _ et al .",
    "_ 1985 ) , protoplanets with @xmath8 induce the formation of a gap near their orbit as a consequence of their tidal torque on the nascent disks ( goldreich & tremaine 1978 , 1980 , lin & papaloizou 1980 , 1986a , 1993 ) . in relatively massive and fast evolving disks , the outward transfer of angular momentum due to",
    "the disks intrinsic turbulence can lead to an inward mass flux ( @xmath9 ) and the migration of the gas giant planets ( lin & papaloizou 1986b ) .",
    "this process is commonly referred to as type ii migration ( ward 1997 ) .",
    "this migration scenario was resurrected to account for the origin of the first known short - period extra solar planet ( lin _ et al .",
    "although type - ii migration provides a natural avenue for relocating some gas giants , a mechanism is needed to retain these planets close to their host stars .",
    "moreover , many stars are born with rapid rotation ( stassun 2001 ) .",
    "when young planets venture close to their host stars , angular momentum would be transferred from the stellar spin to the planet s orbit if the stellar spin frequency @xmath10 is still larger than the planet s orbital frequency ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the rate of the star - to - planet angular momentum transfer intensifies rapidly and may exceed that from the planet to the disk .",
    "two basic physical effects were suggested as potential migration barriers .",
    "the first one is tidal interaction between the host star and the planet .",
    "the gravitational perturbation of the star and close - in planet leads to responses in both the star and planet . for tidal frequencies smaller than twice the spin frequency ,",
    "inertial waves are excited in the convective envelope of the host star and are dissipated there by turbulent viscosity ( ogilvie & lin 2007 ) .",
    "but , the tide excited by a close - in gas giant planet in a star , with a structure similar to that of the present sun , marginally fails to achieve nonlinearity so that their survival is ensured . nevertheless , during the formation epoch of solar - type stars , conditions at the center of the star evolve , so that nonlinearity may set in at a critical age , resulting in a relatively intense star - planet tidal interaction .",
    "the second effect suggested is based on the magnetic interaction between the host star and the planet .",
    "young t tauri stars also have radii ( @xmath12 ) 2 - 3 times that of the present - day sun ( @xmath13 ) and several thousand gausses fields ( @xmath14 ) on their surface ( johns - krull 2007 ) .",
    "the stellar magnetosphere threads across the inner regions of the disk and clears a cavity out to a critical radius ( @xmath15 ) which is determined by both the magnitude @xmath14 and @xmath9 ( konigl 1991 ) .",
    "the subsequent complex interplay between accretion and outflow leads to angular momentum exchange which induces @xmath10 to evolve toward @xmath11 at @xmath15 ( shu 1994 ) .",
    "when the planet s orbital semi major axis ( @xmath16 ) reduces well inside @xmath15 , its lindblad resonances relocate inside the star s magnetospheric cavity . in principle , the planet s migration would stall due to its diminishing tidal torque on the disk .",
    "however , if the star s magnetospheric interaction with the disk can lead to @xmath17 , the planet inside the magnetospheric cavity would have @xmath18 .",
    "in this limit , the star - planet tidal interaction would induce a transfer of angular momentum from the planet to the star .",
    "in addition , the differential motion between the planet and the stellar spinning magnetosphere induces an electromagnetic field with a potential to generate a large current analogeous to the interaction between the jovian magnetosphere with its satellite io ( goldreich & lynden - bell 1969 ) .",
    "the associated lorentz force drives an orbital evolution toward a synchroneous state , in which case , angular momentum would be transferred from the planets with @xmath18 to their host stars , and the planets would continue their orbital decay .    in order to determine the necessary condition for the retention of close - in young planets , we examine , in this paper , their interaction with the magnetosphere of their host t tauri stars . in  2 , we briefly recapitulate the essential concepts and validity of previous investigations on some related topics and give an overview of the key phenomena that will be discussed in this and later papers . in  3 ,",
    "we adopt an existing model in order to examine the interaction between a planet and the magnetosphere of its host star . in  4 , we compute precisely the planet s magnetic diffusivity for a specific set of parameters , as well as the corresponding ohmic dissipation rate within that planet . in  5 , we suggest that the ohmic dissipation can generate sufficient heat to inflat the planet . in  6 , we construct an idealized self - consistent model in which the polytropic and isothermal equations of state are utilized .",
    "these equations represent the expected outcome of radiation transfer within the fully convective interior and the isothermal surface of a close - in planet which is exposed to the intense radiation from its host star .",
    "this internal model allows us to compute the magnetic diffusivity . with these tools",
    ", we discuss in  7 the structural adjustment of the planet in response to this heating source and we compute the ohmic dissipation and mass loss rate for different set of parameters .",
    "finally in  8 , we summarize our results and discuss their implications .",
    "two previous analyses are directly relevant to the present study : 1 ) the interaction of io with the magnetosphere of jupiter and 2 ) the spin - orbit synchronization in binary stars containing a magnetized white dwarf and its main sequence or white dwarf or planetary companion .",
    "io orbits around jupiter inside its magnetosphere once every 1.7 days which is considerably longer than jupiter s 10 hours spin period .",
    "this relative motion imposes a periodic variation in jupiter s decametric emission ( duncan 1966 ) .",
    "a class of models that accounts for the origin of this emission was developped based on the assumption that io has a sufficiently high conductivity . in io",
    "s rest frame , the electric field vanishes and the steady component of jupiter s magnetic field permeates in io s interior over time .",
    "when a steady state is established , the tube of constant magnetic flux is firmly frozen into io ( piddington and drake 1968 ) due to its high conductivity . the flux tube carried by io",
    "moves through the surrounding field lines ( which corotate with jupiter ) and slips through jupiter s less conductive ionosopheric surface .",
    "plasma in jupiter s ionosphere flows around the tube and introduces a potential difference across it ( goldreich & lynden - bell 1969 ) .",
    "the associated electric field drives a current which travels down one half of the flux tube from io and is sent back to io along the other half . within the flux tube connecting io and jupiter s ionosphere and those across it on io , the electric field vanishes as a consequence of high conductivity .",
    "thus , this dc circuit is closed by io as a unipolar inductor .    the magnitude of the electric current is primarily determined by the pederson conductivity at the foot of the flux tube _",
    "i.e. _ on the ionosphere of jupiter .",
    "finite conductivity also determines the magnitude of the drag against the slipage of the flux tube through jupiter .",
    "this drag results in energy dissipation on the surface of jupiter and in a torque on the orbital motion of io , driving the system towards a state of synchronization .",
    "this configuration is justified by the assumption that a constant flux tube is firmly anchored on and dragged along by io which requires the conductivity in io to be much higher than that in jupiter s ionosphere . a 10@xmath19 inclination between jupiter s magnetic dipole and rotation axis does introduce a periodic variation ( over a synodic period ) in the field felt by io .",
    "the permeation and dissipation of this time - dependent ac field may be negligible in the limit of high conductivity in io .",
    "the validity of the key assumption for the unipolar induction model ( _ i.e. _ conductivity on io is larger than that in jupiter s ionosphere ) has also been challenged by dermott ( 1970 ) .",
    "a modest resistence in io would distort the field which may lead to field slippage through io . in this case",
    ", the passage of io through the magnetosphere of jupiter would lead to the generation of alfven waves along the flux tube ( drell _ et al .",
    "_ 1965 , neubauer 1980 ) .",
    "but , due to the field displacement , the waves , partially reflected at the foot of the flux tube on jupiter s surface , may not be able to return to io , in which case the dc circuit would be broken and the motion of io would be decoupled from the that of the flux tube . nevertheless , the alfven waves are dissipated inside both io and jupiter , leading to a torque which must depend on their penetration depth .",
    "an alternative class of scenarios has been proposed based on the assumption that the magnetosphere is everywhere anchored on jupiter and the flux tube moves freely through io ( gurnett 1972 ) .",
    "this model requires the conductivity in jupiter s ionosphere to be larger than that in io .",
    "it assumes that the presence of io creates a plasma sheath with an electric field to cancel the induced emf associated with the motion of io relative to jupiter s magnetosphere ( shawhan 1976 ) .",
    "the simplifying approximations in the development of this theory have been challenged by piddington ( 1977 ) who questioned both the validity of the sheath - creation mechanism and the self - consistency of the internal and external field configurations , subjected to the electric currents in and around io .    on the observational side , uv emissions from io s footprint on jupiter has been observed .",
    "but , it extends well beyond the intersection between io s flux tube and jupiter s ionosphere and the emssion downstream is protracted ( clarke _ et al .",
    "these observations do not agree with the simple interpretation of either the unipolar induction or the plasma sheath scenarios .",
    "there are many close binary - star systems with a white dwarf as their primary component .",
    "these systems also contain main sequence stars and other white dwarfs as secondary components in compact and circular orbits around each other . in some cases",
    ", mass is transferred from the secondary to the primary . in other cases ,",
    "gravitational radiation may play an important role in determining the evolution of these systems .",
    "a sub class of such interacting binary stars , am her systems , is composed of a magnetized white - dwarf primary and a lower - mass main sequence star as its secondary in a fully synchroneous orbit despite the ongoing mass transfer between them ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "this orbital configuration is very similar to that of the jupiter - io system despite the enormous difference between the mass ratio in the two cases .",
    "the motivation for studying the impact of magnetic coupling between these stellar components is to assess whether this synchronous state can be achieved through the ohmic dissipation of the white dwarf s field in the main sequence star s surface ( joss _ et al .",
    "_ 1979 ) . toward this goal ,",
    "campbell ( 1983 , hereafter c83 ) adopted a novel approach by considering the penetration and dissipation of a periodically variable field , associated with an asynchronously spinning primary .",
    "campbell s approach is fundamentally different from that of the unipolar induction model . in this analysis ,",
    "campbell focussed on the flow in the envelope of the secondary and neglected the possibility of current flowing through the flux tube between the secondary star / satellite and the surface of the primary star / planet .",
    "this vacuum - surrounding approximation is justifiable since conductivity on the primary is likely to be much larger than that on the secondary and the stationary component of the field is frozen in the white - dwarf primary but not in the main - sequence secondary .",
    "campbell analyzed the time dependent response of the secondary , including the modification of the field by the induced ( ac ) current in it ( campbell 2005 ) , to the periodic modulation of the field .",
    "in contrast , the unipolar induction model depends on the explicit assumption that the field is anchored on the secondary and its distortion near the secondary must be small so that a complete current loop can be established between the primary and the secondary .",
    "campbell determined the periodic diffusion of the field and the ohmic dissipation of the induced ac current in the companion whereas that of the induced dc current is assumed to occur in the primary in the unipolar induction model .    in recent applications of the unipolar induction model in the context of interaction between white dwarf binary stars ,",
    "the current induced by the unperturbed field has been computed but the induced field generated by the current was neglected ( wu _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 , dallosso _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 ) . a tidal torque is computed at the footprint of the flux tube , which is attached to the secondary white dwarf , on the surface of the magnetized primary white dwarf .",
    "a totally self - consistent solution of this diffult and complex problem remains outstanding .",
    "in addition to the uncertain anchorage location of the field , it is not clear whether the resulting misalignment of the total ( original plus induced ) field and current may be sufficiently large to break the circuit , in which case , campbell s model may be more appropriate .      in this subsection",
    ", we summarize the physical description of the two models just presented ( the unipolar inductor versus the periodic diffusion ) by explicating the mathematical approximations made in each one of them .",
    "the complete mhd induction equation can be expressed as @xmath20 where the magnetic diffusivity @xmath21 and the electrical conductivity @xmath22 functions of position and @xmath23 is the permeability .",
    "if @xmath24 is constant , the second term on the right hand side becomes @xmath25 which reduces to a common expression of diffusion .",
    "the two models ( unipolar induction versus periodic diffusion ) consider two complementary approximations of equation [ complete mhd induction equation ] . in the problem where io is treated as an unipolar inductor , its conductivity is explicitly assumed to be large so that the second term on the right hand ( the diffusion term ) is negligible compared to the first ( _ i.e. _ the induction term ) . in this configuration , one can show that the field lines of the steady component of the magnetic field are moving with io and appear to be `` frozen '' on io ( see appendix a ) . alternatively , in the model considered by campbell , it is the first term on the right hand side that is being neglected .",
    "moreover , only the diffusion of the time dependent component of the field is being considered .",
    "this approximation is valid if the two interacting bodies are almost in corotation ( _ i.e. _ the relative speed @xmath26 that appears in equation ( [ complete mhd induction equation ] ) is small ) , or if the conductivity in the secondary is small .",
    "the process under investigation in this paper is analogeous to both the jupiter - io and the interacting binary star problems .",
    "in fact , the unipolar induction model has already been applied to study the orbital evolution of terrestrial planets or the cores of gas giants around white dwarfs ( li _ et al .",
    "there are even follow - up determination of the radio flux densities from potential white - dwarf / planet systems ( willes & wu 2005 ) . in this analysis ,",
    "although the dissipation of the induced current due to the finite conductivities in the white dwarf was considered , the feedback modification of the field and the dissipation within the planet have been neglected ( li _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) . as discussed above",
    ", it is not clear whether a dc circuit can be closed to promote the unipolar induction mechanism .    in light of these uncertainties , we consider both classes of models for the interaction of close - in planets with their magnetized host stars . in this paper , we focus our discussion on the mechanism described by campbell , and apply it to a hot - jupiter revolving around its star .",
    "we will return to the unipolar induction problem in a later paper .",
    "when young planets first arrive at the vicinity of their host stars , they are unlikely to be in a totally synchronized state .",
    "the stellar magnetic field felt by the planet may be dominated by the periodic modulation associated with the synodic ( between the stellar spin and the planet s orbit ) motion .",
    "in addition , the temperature in the planet s surface is expected to be @xmath27 k and the conductivity there may be moderate . in response to the modulation of the field , the interior of the planet continually adjusts to the magnetization effects so that the flux tube can not be effectively frozen in the planet .",
    "all of these boundary condition suggest that at least over some regions of the planet ( especially on the night side where the photo ionization due to the stellar flux is negligible ) , the modulation of the field may lead to an induced current inside the planet which does not contribute to the close circuit of a unipolar inductor .    following the geometry introduced by campbell ( c83 ) , we consider a close - in gas giant planet , with a finite conductivity , interacting with a time - dependent magnetic field generated by the star .",
    "an induced current is generated inside the planet , which is associated with an ohmic dissipation rate .",
    "our main contributions to the model used by campbell are : 1 ) the relevant diffusivity inside the gas giant planets , 2 ) the effects of the ohmic dissipation on the planet s internal structure , and 3 ) the resulting orbital evolution of the planet .",
    "( items 2 and 3 have negligible consequence in the interacting binary star problem considered by campbell ) .",
    "since we are only considering the dissipation in the planet s interior , the associated torque applied on its orbit should be regarded as a lower limit .    in our scenario",
    ", we postulate that at sufficiently close proximity to the host star , the stellar magnetic field is sufficiently intense that the ohmic dissipation of the periodically diffused field inside the planet is adequate to heat and to inflat the planet until it overflows its roche lobe .",
    "the hemisphere of the planet facing its host star is also exposed to the intense flux of uv radiation during the stellar infancy .",
    "it is possible for the planet to develop a substantial ionosphere regardless the state of synchronization between the planet s orbit and spin ( the time scale for establishing local ionization equilibrium is much faster than the planet s spin and orbital periods ) .    we will separately study these two phenomena ( angular momentum transfert due to mass loss and presence of a ionosphere ) in the follow - up papers of this serie .",
    "we will show that the angular momentum transfer associated with the mass transfer can halt the orbital evolution of the planet .",
    "we will also present an analysis on the conductivities in the planet s day - side ionosphere and on the host stars surface .",
    "this will lead to an analysis on the condition for the unipolar induction to effectively operate and apply a significant slow - down torque on the planet s orbit .",
    "in this section , we are going to derive the governing equations that we use to compute the ohmic dissipation rate .",
    "various equations are presented here for the purpose of introducing the algorithm of the numerical models to be presented in subsequent chapters .",
    "although we follow closely the approach made in c83 , for brevity , we do not repeatedly cite this reference .",
    "but , wherever similarities occur , referal of campbell s earlier work is implicitly implied . also ,",
    "throughout the paper , we use si units .",
    "we consider a protoplanetary system with a gas giant planet revolving around a t tauri star with an angular frequency @xmath28 .",
    "well beyond the planet s semi major axis , there is also a protoplanetary disk .",
    "the host star has a dipolar moment @xmath29 tilted with an angle @xmath30 with respect to its spinning axis ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the angular frequency of the stellar spin is @xmath10 .",
    "the orbital axis of the disk and the planet are parallel to the star s spinning axis .",
    "the following analysis is applied to a frame of reference centered on the star and rotating with the planet .    in this frame , the planet is a fixed object ( the planet s spin is neglected ) in a periodic magnetic field with a frequency @xmath31 . from ohm",
    "s law @xmath32 and maxwell s equations @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the equation on the magnetic field becomes : @xmath35    it follows that in the mechanism considered by campbell ( as well as in this paper ) , it is the time dependent stellar magnetic field , diffusing inside the secondary ( for campbell ) or the hot jupiter ( in our paper ) , as well as the planet s induced magnetic field , that generate the current inside the planet , following the equation @xmath36 .",
    "the relative speed between the planet and the stellar magnetic field thus intervenes not through @xmath37 but through the time dependence in the stellar magnetic field that diffuses in the planet .",
    "following c83 , we only consider the poloidal component @xmath38 of the magnetic field : @xmath39 where @xmath38 is a function of r , @xmath40 , @xmath41 . and",
    "can be expanded in terms of the sperical harmonics @xmath42 ( equation [ decomposition of phi ] ) .",
    "moreover the variation in time of the magnetic field felt by the planet is periodic . in the limit where the field penetrates quickly in the planet",
    "compared to the time scale on which the field changes ( so that the planet can respond `` adiabatically '' ) , we can account for the time dependence of @xmath38 by mutiplying its spatial part by @xmath43 : @xmath44e^{i\\omega t } \\label{decomposition of phi } \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ ( l \\geqslant 0\\ and\\ -l\\leqslant m\\leqslant l)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 are constant coefficients and @xmath46 is a function of @xmath47 to be determined .",
    "we then replace * b * in the left hand of ( 2 ) by its expression in ( 3 ) .",

    ", we obtain : @xmath49 this equation holds inside and outside the planet ( same as eqs 16 and 18 in c83 ) .",
    "however , outside the planet , the conductivity is assumed to be very low and , therefore , the magnetic diffusivity is extremely high compared to the diffusivity inside the planet . in the limit where the magnetic diffusivity outside tends to infinity ( equivalent to a vacuum surrounding ) ,",

    "<S> the unanticipated discovery of the first close - in planet around 51 peg has rekindled the notion that shortly after their formation outside the snow line , some planets may have migrated to the proximity of their host stars because of their tidal interaction with their nascent disks . after a decade of discoveries , nearly 20 % of the 200 known planets have similar short periods . </S>",
    "<S> if these planets indeed migrated to their present - day location , their survival would require a halting mechanism in the proximity of their host stars . </S>",
    "<S> here we consider the possibility that a magnetic coupling between young stars and planets could quench the planet s orbital evolution . </S>",
    "<S> most t tauri stars have magnetic fields of several thousand gausses on their surface which can clear out a cavity in the innermost regions of their circumstellar disks and impose magnetic induction on the nearby young planets . after a brief discussion of the complexity of the full problem , we focus our discussion on evaluating the permeation and ohmic dissipation of the time dependent component of the stellar magnetic field in the planet s interior . adopting a model first introduced by campbell for interacting binary stars </S>",
    "<S> , we determine the modulation of the planetary response to the tilted magnetic field of a non - synchronously spinning star . </S>",
    "<S> we first compute the conductivity in the young planets , which indicates that the stellar field can penetrate well into the planet s envelope in a synodic period . for various orbital configurations , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the energy dissipation rate inside the planet is sufficient to induce short - period planets to inflate . </S>",
    "<S> this process results in mass loss via roche lobe overflow and in the halting of the planet s orbital migration .    . </S>"
