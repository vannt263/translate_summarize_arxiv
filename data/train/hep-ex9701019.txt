    "we conclude with section  [ conclude_sec ] .      in 1977",
    "the bottom quark was discovered as a resonance in the dimuon mass spectrum in 400 gev proton - nucleus collisions at fermilab @xcite .",
    "soon after the discovery the so - called @xmath4  resonances at a mass of about 9.5   were confirmed in @xmath5 collisions at the doris storage ring at desy @xcite . from the narrow resonance observed at @xmath6",
    "the pluto and dasp detectors were able to determine the electronic width @xmath7 , which implied a charge assignment of @xmath8 for the @xmath9 quark .",
    "it took a few years until decays of @xmath0 mesons , bound states of a @xmath9  quark and a light quark , were observed in 1983 by the cleo collaboration @xcite .",
    "the weak isospin of the @xmath9 quark was first extracted from the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath10 in @xmath11 at petra @xcite , where the measurement of @xmath12% at @xmath13  gev was found to be consistent with the standard model prediction of @xmath14% assuming @xmath15 for the weak isospin of the @xmath9 quark .",
    "this indicated that the bottom quark has a partner and it can be counted as the first evidence for the existence of the top quark .",
    "finally , concluding this brief historical overview with a link between top and @xmath0 physics , @xmath16 mixing was first observed by the argus collaboration in 1987 @xcite .",
    "the measurement of a large mixing parameter @xmath17 was the first indication of a large top quark mass .",
    "why are we discussing the history of @xmath9 quark physics ?",
    "a certain pattern can be observed after the discovery of a new quark .",
    "this pattern appears to repeat itself after the discovery of the top quark .",
    "it looks like right after the discovery of the @xmath9 quark an attempt was made to confirm the discovery in a different environment like @xmath18 collisions .",
    "then the fundamental quantities of the newly discovered quark , like its charge and isospin , were determined .",
    "after sufficient statistics is accumulated rare phenomena like @xmath19 oscillations were searched for . nowadays , @xmath0 physics",
    "is fully explored at @xmath5 colliders and rare phenomena like @xmath20 transitions or @xmath21 penguin decays are also studied @xcite .",
    "this raises the question of why @xmath0 physics is studied at a @xmath2 hadron collider which is a much more difficult environment to study low p_t @xmath22physics .",
    "we shall discuss this issue further on , in section  [ b_sec ] .",
    "the experimental search for the top quark begun soon after the discovery of the @xmath9  quark . between 1979 and 1984 measurements of @xmath23 , the ratio of the cross sections @xmath24 hadrons ) to @xmath25 ,",
    "were performed at the petra @xmath18 storage ring up to a centre - of - mass energy of 46.8 gev .",
    "the value of @xmath23 was found to be consistent with standard model predictions without a top quark contribution setting a lower bound on the top quark mass @xcite of @xmath26 .",
    "later searches at @xmath5 colliders were also negative and limits on m_top @xmath27  of half of the centre - of - mass energy were set .",
    "these limits from tristan @xcite as well as slc @xcite and lep @xcite are listed in table  [ top_limits ] .    with the advantage of higher mass regions being accessible ,",
    "the search for the top quark was soon dominated by @xmath2 colliders , first at the sps collider ( @xmath28  gev ) at cern and then at the tevatron ( @xmath29 tev ) at fermilab .",
    "initial results reported in 1984 by the ua1 collaboration @xcite at the sps seemed to be consistent with the production of a top quark of mass @xmath30  in @xmath31 .",
    "the results were based on the observation of 12 isolated lepton plus 2-jet events with an expected background of approximately 3.5 events in 200  @xmath32b@xmath33 . however , these first results were not supported by a subsequent ua1  analysis @xcite with a higher statistics data sample setting a lower limit on m_top @xmath27  of @xmath34  .",
    "more sensitive searches were performed later on by ua2 @xcite and with the start of the tevatron .",

    "since the @xmath0 meson is not fully reconstructed , its @xmath44 can not be directly obtained .",
    "the boost of the @xmath0 meson is determined from the observed decay products and a @xmath45 correction is applied as obtained from a monte carlo simulation .    in order to tag the @xmath0 flavour at production",

    "to study the correlation between the flavour of the @xmath0 meson and the charged particles produced in association with it , we consider all tracks that are within an @xmath47-@xmath48 cone of radius @xmath49 centered around the direction of the @xmath0 candidate . since the @xmath0 meson is only partially reconstructed , we approximate this direction with the momentum sum of the lepton and charm hadron",
    ".    the tracks considered as tags should be consistent with the hypothesis that they originate from the fragmentation chain or the decay of @xmath46 mesons , i.e. that they originate from the primary vertex of the event .",
    "all tracks with transverse momentum @xmath50",
    "gev/@xmath51 are therefore required to satisfy @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the distance of closest approach of the track trajectory to the estimated @xmath0  production position , and @xmath54 is the estimated error on this quantity .",
    "string fragmentation models indicate that the velocity of the fragmentation particles , that we seek for our tag , is close to the velocity of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "similarly , pions from @xmath46 decays should also have a velocity that is close to the velocity of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "in particular , the relative - transverse momentum ( @xmath55 ) of the particle with respect to the combined momentum of the @xmath0 momentum plus particle momentum , should be small .",

    "since we know the flavour of the @xmath0 meson at decay from the @xmath58 signature , we compare the number of right - sign ( @xmath59 ) correlations to the number of wrong - sign ( @xmath60 ) tags as a function of @xmath36 . for the @xmath61 meson",

    "we correct for this cross talk by performing a fit bin by bin in @xmath36 .",
    "the inputs to the fit are the raw asymmetries as measured in each sample for a given @xmath36 bin , and parameters describing the @xmath67 composition in semileptonic @xmath0 decays .",
    "we fit the corrected @xmath61 asymmetry as a function of @xmath36 to a cosine convoluted with the @xmath36 resolution function , and extract the mixing frequency @xmath37 as well as the dilution @xmath56 of the same side tagging algorithm as shown in fig .",

    "there are more time dependent @xmath1 oscillation measurements in preparation at cdf , like a mixing analysis using a soft lepton tag ( see sec .",

    "the result from this analysis is @xmath72 since there is an event overlap of about 10% between this analysis and the @xmath71 analysis , a combined cdf average has not yet been determined , but cdf s mixing results start to become competitive with the lep measurements  @xcite .",
    "in run  i the luminosity of the tevatron was limited by the antiproton current .",
    "the fermilab accelerator complex is undergoing an upgrade to produce an order of magnitude higher luminosities in the tevatron . the largest change will be to replace the main ring with the new main injector , which will be housed in a new tunnel . the main injector will provide higher proton intensity onto the antiproton production target , and larger aperture for the antiproton transfer into the tevatron . after the completion and comissioning of the main injector ,",
    "the tevatron is scheduled to deliver luminosity again in summer of 1999 .",
    "the centre - of - mass energy will then be at 2.0 tev .",

    "the physics projections for run  ii presented here assume 2  @xmath75b@xmath33 of integrated luminosity .",
    "in addition to the tevatron upgrade the cdf and d  experiments will undergo major detector upgrades , which are described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "in run  ii both collider detectors will be equipped with new and improved silicon vertex detectors which will for example enhance the efficiency to detect top decays .",
    "in addition , the tevatron s centre - of - mass energy will be at 2.0 tev , which will increase the top quark production cross section by 40% .",
    "the estimated yield per experiment will be about 160 dilepton events , 990 lepton plus 4-jet events with one or more @xmath9 tags and for the top mass measurement about 240 lepton plus 4-jet events where both @xmath9 jets are tagged .",
    "this will result in a statistical uncertainty on the top quark mass measurement of 1 - 2  .",
    "the top production cross section will be known with a precision of better than 10% .",
