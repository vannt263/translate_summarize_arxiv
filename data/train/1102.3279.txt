    "the investigation of strongly correlated materials is one of the main challenges of modern condensed matter theory , which has inspired the research activities of many scientists in the last decades .",
    "the physical properties of such materials are characterized by an interplay between the coulomb interaction of the nearly confined electrons and their kinetic energy .",
    "this competition results in a delicate balance of localization and delocalization , which requires accurate non - perturbative approaches .",
    "dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) has become a standard tool for the investigation of strongly correlated materials @xcite and has been applied to models as well as to the investigation of real materials@xcite .",
    "dmft for the first time allowed to treat the coherent low - energy excitations and the high - energy excitations as well as their mutual feedback on the same footing .",
    "+ the main concept of the dmft is to replace the correlated lattice by a single impurity embedded in a self - consistent effective medium .",
    "in contrast to classical mean - field approaches , the effective medium in dmft is represented by an energy dependent electronic bath which takes local temporal quantum fluctuations into account , whereas spatial fluctuations are frozen out .",
    "the solution of the dmft equations in turn requires accurate impurity solvers .",
    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) algorithms are nowadays widely used for this purpose .",
    "continuous - time qmc solvers@xcite allow to tackle problems with @xmath0 or even @xmath1 orbitals as required for systems with open @xmath2 or @xmath3-shells , respectively .",
    "nevertheless , they suffer from two major drawbacks : the fermionic sign problem for a general coulomb vertex and more severely the fact that qmc algorithms work in the imaginary time domain require the numerically ill - conditioned analytical continuation of stochastic data to the real axis .",
    "this makes it difficult to reliably access spectral properties and to study e.g. multiplett effects in solids .",
    "+ in principal a rigorous approach , which can work on the real - axis , is the exact diagonalization ( ed ) or lanczos scheme@xcite . here",
    "the continuous bath is discretized by a small collection of bath sites , so that the problem can be diagonalized exactly . due to the exponential growth of the hilbert space with the number of bath parameters , one",
    "is limited to as little as one or two bath sites per _ d_-orbital , so that finite size effects may become dominant .",
    "in addition , an ambiguity arises in determining the effective bath parameters to find an optimal representation of the input hybridization .",
    "alternative approximate approaches comprise the iterated perturbation theory ( ipt ) @xcite , the fluctuation - exchange ( flex ) @xcite or non - crossing approximation ( nca ) @xcite and the related hybridization expansion @xcite .",
    "these perturbative methods are naturally limited to some parameter window and fail outside this region . flex and ipt are applicable for weak - coupling , while the hybridization expansion works in the strong coupling regime .",
    "+ recently an impurity solver has been developed by combining ed with a diagrammatic approach .",
    "the key idea is to formulate a perturbation expansion around the ed solution by employing a transformation to auxiliary , so - called dual fermions@xcite .",
    "we refer to the perturbation of a non - trivial ( i.e. interacting ) albeit numerically solvable reference problem as a superperturbation@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the method becomes exact in two opposite limits : for weak coupling and and strong hybridization , the approach becomes equivalent to a standard perturbation expansion in the interaction . in the opposite limit of strong interaction and weak hybridization",
    "the formalism resembles the strong coupling expansion@xcite .",
    "this method can be sytematically improved by either including more bath sites in the ed ( which essentially decreases the perturbation ) or by including more diagrams .    in the previous work",
    "the solver has been formulated in imaginary time .",
    "analytical continuation was found to be significantly more stable than in qmc due to the absence of statistical noise . in this article",
    ", we formulate the superperturbation theory on the real - axis , making analytical continuation from intermediate imaginary time results obsolete .",
    "to set the stage , we briefly review the superperturbation formalism in the following . for further reading",
    "we refer the interested reader to@xcite . the model under consideration",
    "is the anderson impurity model described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath4 + \\sum_{k\\alpha\\beta}\\left ( v_{k}^{\\alpha\\beta}c_{\\alpha}^{\\dagger}b_{k\\beta}+v^{\\ast\\beta\\alpha}_{k}b_{k\\alpha}^{\\dagger}c_{\\beta}\\right).\\ ] ] here greek letters are used as a combined index for orbital and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "@xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) are the bath ( impurity ) creation and annihilation operators , respectively .",
    "@xmath9 is the local electron - electron interaction , @xmath10 are the transition amplitudes for hopping processes from the bath to an impurity orbital . to derive a dual formulation of the problem , we first integrate out the bath degrees of freedom , which leads to the conventional action representation : @xmath11=-\\sum_{\\omega \\alpha \\beta } { c^{\\ast}_{\\omega \\alpha}}[(i\\omega+\\mu)\\eins - { \\delta(\\omega)}]_{\\alpha \\beta}c_{\\omega \\beta}+ s^{\\text{int}}[{c^{\\ast}_{}},c_{}].\\ ] ] here",
    "@xmath12 is a non - gaussian interaction term and @xmath13_{\\alpha\\beta } = \\sum_{k\\gamma } \\frac{v^{\\alpha\\gamma}_{k } ( v^{\\beta\\gamma}_{k})^*}{i\\omega - \\epsilon_{k\\gamma}}\\ ] ] is the hybridization function of the full system .",
    "the first step in the formulation of the superperturbation is to express the action of the model in terms of that of an exactly solvable reference problem and a difference term . to this end ,",
    "we add and subtract a hybridization function @xmath14 corresponding to a discrete bath : @xmath15&=s^{\\text{ref}}[{c^{\\ast}_{}},c ] -{\\sum_{\\omega\\alpha \\beta}}{c^{\\ast}_{\\omega \\alpha}}[{\\delta^{\\text{n}}(\\omega)}-{\\delta(\\omega)}]_{\\alpha \\beta}c_{\\omega \\beta},\\\\\\label{deriv_ref_ac } s^{\\text{ref}}[{c^{\\ast}_{}},c]&=-{\\sum_{\\omega\\alpha \\beta}}{c^{\\ast}_{\\omega \\alpha}}[(i\\omega+\\mu)\\eins-{\\delta^{\\text{n}}(\\omega)}]_{\\alpha \\beta } c_{\\omega \\beta}+ s^{\\text{int}}[{c^{\\ast}_{}},c_{}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the reference system with a discrete bath with @xmath16 bath sites shares the interaction part of the original problem and can be solved efficiently by exact diagonalization .",
    "note that this step leaves the hybridization @xmath14 unspecified .",
    "the second step is to reformulate the problem in such a way that a perturbative treatment of the difference term @xmath17 can be performed .",
    "since @xmath18 contains a non - quadratic part wick s theorem is not directly applicable .",
    "therefore , we introduce auxiliary ( dual ) fermionic degrees of freedom using an exact gaussian identity in the path integral : @xmath19e^{-{f^{\\ast}_{\\alpha}}b_{\\alpha \\beta}f_{\\beta}+{f^{\\ast}_{\\alpha}}a_{\\alpha \\beta}c_{\\beta}+{c^{\\ast}_{\\alpha}}a_{\\alpha \\beta}f_{\\beta}},\\ ] ] where the matrices @xmath20 and @xmath7 have the following form : @xmath21^{-1}g^{-1}(\\omega)\\end{aligned } \\right\\ } \\rightarrow a_{\\alpha \\beta}b^{-1}_{\\beta \\gamma}a_{\\gamma \\delta}=[{\\delta^{\\text{n}}(\\omega)}-{\\delta(\\omega)}]_{\\alpha \\delta}=d(\\omega),\\ ] ] with @xmath22 being the exact single particle green s function of the reference system eq . . after the transformation , the resulting action has a mixed representation of @xmath8- and @xmath3-fermions : @xmath23=&s^{\\text{ref}}[{c^{\\ast}_{}},c_{}]+s^{\\text{c}}[{f^{\\ast}_{}},f,{c^{\\ast}_{}},c_{}]+{\\sum_{\\omega\\alpha \\beta}}{f^{\\ast}_{\\omega \\alpha}}[g(\\omega)d(\\omega)g(\\omega)]^{-1}_{\\alpha \\beta}f_{\\omega \\beta},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the coupling between the @xmath8 and @xmath3-fermions is given by @xmath24=&{\\sum_{\\omega \\alpha \\beta}}{f^{\\ast}_{\\omega \\alpha}}g^{-1}_{\\alpha \\beta}(\\omega)c_{\\omega \\beta } + { \\sum_{\\omega \\alpha \\beta}}{c^{\\ast}_{\\omega \\alpha}}g^{-1}_{\\alpha \\beta}(\\omega)f_{\\omega \\beta}.\\label{eq : sc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the original fermionic degrees of freedom can formally be integrated out exactly .",
    "to this end , we expand in @xmath25 in the path integral representation of the partition function .",
    "it is convenient to reexpress the result in the following form : @xmath26-s^{\\text{c}}&[{c^{\\ast}_{}},c,{f^{\\ast}_{}},f])\\mathcal{d}[{c^{\\ast}_{}},c]\\\\   & \\overset{!}{=}z_{\\text{ref}}\\exp(-{\\sum_{\\omega\\alpha \\beta}}{f^{\\ast}_{\\omega \\alpha}}g^{-1}_{\\alpha \\beta}(\\omega)f_{\\omega \\beta } + v[{f^{\\ast}_{}},f ] ) .",

    "the key point is that due to the presence of @xmath18 on the left - hand - side of ( [ eq : derivation : define_dual_pot ] ) , integrating out the original fermions corresponds to performing the average over the degrees of freedom of the reference system : @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "the resulting dual action has the following form : @xmath28=-{\\sum_{\\omega\\alpha \\beta}}{f^{\\ast}_{\\omega \\alpha}}[g^{\\text{d}}_{0}(\\omega)]^{-1}_{\\alpha \\beta}f_{\\omega \\beta}+v[{f^{\\ast}_{}},f].\\ ] ] as a result of averaging , both the bare dual matrix green function @xmath29^{-1}g(\\omega)$ ] and the dual potential @xmath30=-\\frac{1}{4}\\gamma^{(4)}_{\\alpha \\beta \\gamma \\delta}{f^{\\ast}_{\\alpha}}f_{\\beta}{f^{\\ast}_{\\gamma}}f_{\\delta}+\\frac{1}{36}\\gamma^{(6)}_{\\alpha \\beta \\gamma \\delta \\mu \\nu}{f^{\\ast}_{\\alpha}}f_{\\beta}{f^{\\ast}_{\\gamma}}f_{\\delta}{f^{\\ast}_{\\mu}}f_{\\nu } \\mp \\dots \\,.\\ ] ] contain the correlation functions of the reference system : @xmath22 denotes its single - particle green s function and @xmath31 are the corresponding reducible vertices .",

    "+ these quantities can be calculated straightforwardly on matsubara frequencies from the lehmann representation of the single- and two - particle green s functions @xcite .",
    "so far , is only a reformulation of the initial action in eq . .",

    "the reference system , which is specified through the hybridization function @xmath14 , should be chosen in an optimal way . here",
    "this is even more crucial than in conventional ed , since for the present approach the number of bath sites should be kept at a minimum to increase the efficiency .",
    "the choice of @xmath14 directly affects the perturbation @xmath43 , which in a certain sense should be minimal .",
    "this can be achieved by minimizing a predefined distance function@xcite .",
    "in order to access spectral properties , the previous formulation required analytical continuation of the imaginary time data .",
    "this is an ill - posed problem , and different methods have been developed for this purpose .",
    "the maximum entropy method ( maxent ) @xcite was specifically designed for inferring spectral properties from statistical data using bayesian methods .",
    "very fine structures , like multiplets for example , are very hard to resolve using this method . in the pad",
    "approach@xcite the function of interest is approximated by a rational function .",
    "pad can give accurate information on the real axis , provided it is applied to noise - free input data . the approximation through a rational function",
    "however is unneccessary for the superperturbation approach and may introduce spurious features .",
    "it order to extract unbiased real axis information , it is desirable to formulate this approach directly on the real axis .    in ed , real axis information is readily obtained by performing the substitution @xmath44 in the lehmann representation , where @xmath45 is a small broadening parameter . for the single - particle green s function",
    "this leads to : @xmath46 from latter expression the density of states ( dos ) is obtained as @xmath47 . in the superperturbation ,",
