    "crack fronts propagating along a weak plane of a disordered material provide an ideal experimental system for studying phenomena such as the depinning transition , the associated avalanche dynamics and roughness of the crack front .",
    "experimentally , by studying systems such as sintered plexiglas plates @xcite and paper sheets @xcite , it has been established that a slowly driven planar crack front propagates in a sequence of avalanches , with a power law size distribution . in the case of the plexiglas experiments the crack fronts",
    "have been observed to be rough @xcite .",
    "as is often the case when studying similar phenomena typically exhibiting some degree of universality , it is expected that the statistical properties of the planar crack fronts can be theoretically described with a simplified model , which here is given by the long - range elastic string @xcite .",
    "such a model has successfully reproduced the statistics of avalanches of crack front propagation @xcite , and in particular the local clusters such avalanches are broken into due to the long range elastic interactions between different segments of the crack front @xcite .",
    "early experiments @xcite found a roughness exponent significantly larger than that predicted by the crack line model @xcite , but a more recent study has shown that the theoretically predicted value of the roughness exponent is recovered if large enough length scales are considered @xcite .",
    "moreover , the short length scale regime has been found to exhibit multiscaling @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the long range elastic string driven in a random potential with a tunable disorder correlation length , in order to clarify the origin and nature of the different scaling regimes of the crack front roughness .",
    "the main benefit of our model as compared to previous studies of the crack line model is that the disorder correlation length @xmath0 can be chosen to be larger than the crack line segment length , thus making it possible to study also the regime below @xmath0 .",
    "it is demonstrated that the problem includes two relevant length scales , the disorder correlation length @xmath0 and the larkin length @xmath1 @xcite . by considering different sets of parameters of the model , the relative magnitudes of these two length scales can be tuned . for strong enough disorder ( or equivalently soft enough lines ) , multiscaling of the crack front is observed for scales below @xmath0 .",
    "asymptotically , for length scales exceeding both @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we recover the well known roughness exponent @xmath2 of the long - range elastic string @xcite .",
    "an intermediate regime characterized by the larkin exponent @xmath4 is observed above @xmath0 and below @xmath1 , if @xmath5 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section , the details of the numerical model are presented . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we present a theoretical description of the expected scaling regimes of the front roughness , while section [ sec4 ] includes detailed numerical results from simulations of the crack line model .",
    "section [ sec5 ] finishes the paper with conclusions and discussion .",
    "the model of a propagating planar crack front considered here is represented by a vector of single - valued integer heights @xmath6 , @xmath7 , with @xmath8 the system size @xcite .",
    "crack propagation is driven by the local stress intensity factor ( sif ) @xmath9 , representing the asymptotic prefactor of the @xmath10 divergence if the stress field near the crack tip .",
    "@xmath9 is taken to be of the form @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 is the first - order variation of the stress intensity factor due to first - order perturbation of the front position @xcite , with @xmath13 the front segment spacing and @xmath14 tunes the strength of the long - range elastic interactions . for periodic boundary conditions along the crack front as considered here , this becomes @xcite @xmath15 @xmath16 is a time - independent disorder field with correlations @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 for @xmath20 and @xmath21 for @xmath22 . in practice",
    ", such a disorder field can be prepared by assigning uncorrelated random numbers from a distribution to a subset of lattice sites forming a square grid with a spacing of @xmath0 , and filling the rest of the lattice sites by using an appropriate interpolation algorithm . here , we use a uniform distribution from -1 to 0 , and bilinear interpolation to obtain a smooth disorder field , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fronts ] for examples .",
    "@xmath23 is the contribution of the external load .",
    "the dynamics is defined in discrete time by setting @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the local velocity of the front element @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the heaviside step function .",
    "parallel dynamics is assumed , such that during a single time step , all the front elements with @xmath28 are advanced by a unit step , @xmath29 .",
    "the local forces are then recomputed for each element , and the process is repeated until @xmath30 for all @xmath26 and the avalanche stops .",
    "the applied load is then increased so that exactly one front element becomes unstable ( i.e. @xmath28 ) , and a new avalanche is initiated . as the crack front advances , the applied sif @xmath23 decreases at a rate proportional to the instantaneous average velocity @xmath31 of the front , with a proportionality constant @xmath32 .",
    "such a protocol leads to a cut - off for the avalanche size distribution scaling with @xmath32 @xcite , and corresponds to quasistatic driving , which has the advantage that observables such as the avalanche sizes can be defined without the need to apply ( a possibly ambiguous ) non - zero threshold .",
    "notice that while the discretized dynamics we employ here neglects the fact that the local velocity of the crack front should be proportional to the local sif , this simplification is well known to have no influence on the scaling behaviour we study here .",
    "as the planar crack front advances along the weak plane , it will roughen due to disorder . such disorder , originating from the fluctuations of the local toughness of the weak plane , is characterized by a fluctuation amplitude @xmath33 and a correlation length @xmath0 .",
    "the crack front morphology can be characterized by considering the structure functions @xcite @xmath34 if the front fluctuations follow gaussian statistics , the structure functions with different @xmath35 can be collapsed by normalizing the @xmath36 s with the gaussian factors @xcite @xmath37^{1/k}.\\ ] ] close to the depinning transition ( i.e. when a slow enough external drive is applied ) , we expect the roughness of the front to be controlled by two length scales , @xmath0 and the larkin length @xmath38 @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will consider the different regimes separately .",
    "for small enough @xmath14 ( or equivalently , large enough @xmath33 ) , the disorder is strong enough to substantially deform the front locally , which may lead to steep slopes ( and possibly even overhangs in experiments and in models which would allow them to be formed ) of the crack front , and thus to multiscaling of the front roughness , or @xmath35-dependent scaling of the structure functions @xmath39 . in the spirit of the idea of strong pinning ( individual `` pinning centers '' , or correlated fluctuations of the random potential ,",
    "are strong enough to substantially deform the front ) , we expect such large deformations and steep slopes of the crack front to take place up to a lateral length scale proportional to the disorder scale @xmath0 .",
    "this regime corresponds to a small larkin length as compared to the scale of the toughness fluctuations , @xmath40 .",
    "thus , we expect to observe multiscaling for scales below @xmath0 , and the asymptotic scaling characterized by the unique roughness exponent @xmath2 for scales larger than @xmath0 . by tuning @xmath14 within this regime , the amplitude of the local deformations and thus the strength of the multiscaling can be changed .      in the opposite limit , where @xmath41 , the toughness fluctuations are weak and no significant deformation of the crack front takes place for lateral scales of the order of @xmath0 .",
    "instead , the front remains essentially undeformed for lateral scales below @xmath1 , and the potential energy fluctuations follow poissonian statistics .",
    "this leads to front roughness characterized by the larkin exponent @xmath42 for scales above @xmath0 and below @xmath1 . for scales above @xmath1 the toughness fluctuations become effective and the asymptotic roughness exponent @xmath2 is expected .",
    "we simulate the crack line model in a system of linear size @xmath43 , by considering different disorder correlation lengths ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) and values of the crack front stiffness ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) .",
    "the value @xmath48 is used for the parameter controlling the avalanche cut - off scale .",
    "[ fig : fronts ] shows examples of the crack front profiles for different @xmath0 and @xmath14 .",
    "also the toughness fluctuations are shown , with dark ( light ) blue corresponding to regions with low ( high ) local toughness .    in the spirit of the discussion of the previous section , we consider the scaling form @xmath49 to account for the effect of varying @xmath0 for fixed @xmath14 . here",
    ", @xmath50 is expected to scale as @xmath51 for @xmath52 and @xmath40 , and @xmath53 for @xmath41 .",
    "[ fig : roughness ] shows the rescaled @xmath39 functions for three different values of @xmath14 . for @xmath54 , the data collapse nicely , verifying the scaling form , eq .",
    "( [ eq : collapse ] ) , and the gaussian nature of the large scale front roughness . also the different scaling regimes as given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fx11 ] ) , ( [ eq : fx12 ] ) and ( [ eq : fx22 ] ) are clearly visible , with @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "notice also that no multiscaling is observed , as long as only scales above @xmath0 are considered .    for @xmath55 and small @xmath14",
    ", the data displays multiscaling , a signature of a deviation from the gaussian statistics .",
    "the strength of this multiscaling depends on @xmath14 .",
    "this indicates that the multiscaling regime may not be universal : different parameters of the model could correspond to different effective exponents within this regime . for large enough @xmath14",
    ", the @xmath55 regime is characterized by a linear dependence of @xmath39 on @xmath56 , or @xmath57 with @xmath58 , and essentially no multiscaling is observed : the small deviation from linear behaviour for the smallest values of @xmath56 in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : roughness ] is due to the discrete nature of the model .",
    "in this paper we have studied the roughness of a planar crack front driven in a disordered medium , by considering the standard crack line model , with the additional ingredient of using toughness fluctuations with a characteristic scale @xmath0 which may be tuned .",
    "such a simple approach has made it possible to identify the relevant length scales of the problem , and to propose an explanation of the experimental results regarding the crack front roughness .",
    "based on our results , we think that the experiments reported in ref .",
    "@xcite correspond to the \" strong pinning ",
    "regime , where the toughness fluctuations cause substantial local deformations of the crack front , visible as multiscaling for short length scales .",
    "we expect the cross - over scale separating this multiscaling regime from the asymptotic scaling regime characterized by the roughness exponent @xmath59 to be proportional to the disorder scale @xmath0 . indeed , in the experiments reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , the cross - over scale is shifted towards larger values when the diameter of the beads used for the sand blasting process to prepare the experimental samples is increased .",
    "moreover , the spatial resolution of the experiment is clearly high enough to observe features of the crack front also below scales corresponding to the diameter of the beads @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear how the statistical properties of the toughness fluctuations depend on the preparation procedure of the samples , making it difficult to make a precise comparison between theory and experiment .",
    "future directions of research related to the present topic would include to develop an experimental setup in which the toughness fluctuations could be controlled , and thus the effect of their statistical properties could be tested properly . regarding the theoretical side , it could be useful to develop a model in which a more accurate expression for the long range interaction kernel would be used , accurately describing interactions between segments of a crack front of an arbitrary shape @xcite . such a more realistic line model for the crack front could also include the possibility to form overhangs .",
    "however , we think that the picture regarding the different scaling regimes and the cross - over scales separating them presented in this paper would hold also in that case .",
