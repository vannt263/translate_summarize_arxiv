    "their heavy masses constitute a new scale that is much larger than the qcd scale , @xmath0 , making their production cross sections at least in principle accessible to calculations in perturbative qcd .",
    "their masses are also much larger than the maximum initial qgp temperature .",
    "heavy quarks acquire their mass almost entirely from the electroweak sector due to their coupling to the higgs field .",
    "therefore , they remain heavy even when chiral symmetry is at least partially restored in a qgp .",
    "this makes heavy quarks a calibrated probe .",
    "heavy - flavor particles provide access to the degree of thermalization among quarks and gluons in the qgp . due to their relatively long lifetime",
    ", heavy - flavor particles can be identified through their decay topology with the decay vertex being displaced from the collision vertex .",

    "an impressive data set has been collected ranging from polarized protons at up to 510 gev and systems as large as uranium - uranium collisions . as part of the beam energy scan program ,",
    "the center - of - mass energy was taken as low as 7 gev .",
    "the phenix collaboration has upgraded its detector with vertexing capabilities at mid- and forward rapidity , enabling the separation of electrons stemming from the semi - leptonic decays of beauty and charm quarks  @xcite .",
    "a ten - fold increased data set is presently being analyzed , which will extend the momentum reach substantially and decrease uncertainties in order to look for potential differences in suppression of beauty and charm quarks in the electron decay channel .",

    "au collisions at 200 gev shows increasingly large suppression of neutral d mesons above 2 @xmath4 , while around 1.5 @xmath4 , a characteristic bump arises with values above unity , see fig .  [ star - d0 ] .",
    "since charm is conserved throughout the evolution of the system , the depletion of the spectrum at large momentum should correspond to an enhancement at lower momentum .",
    "in addition , if charm participates in the collective expansion of the medium , charm flow would lead to a depopulation at very low momentum and further enhance the spectrum at intermediate momentum . both effects would lead to a nuclear modification factor above unity , with a maximum of @xmath3  = 1.21.5 around 1.5 @xmath4 , as experimentally observed . in order to simultaneously describe the nuclear modification factor and elliptic flow measurement of d mesons at top rhic energies , model calculations have to take into account charm diffusion with values of @xmath5 between 211 .",
    "these values coincide with results from the lattice .",
    "all four large - scale lhc experiments participate in the open heavy - flavor program .",
    "this offers the unique opportunity to measure heavy quark production over the entire transverse momentum range from 0 up to 400 @xmath4  over a large rapidity range of more than seven units . at low momentum , where most of the production cross sections is located , particle identification of decay daughters is key since topological selection is limited .",
    "this is especially true for detecting the short - lived charmed baryon @xmath6 .    at lhc energies ,",
    "the alice collaboration has pushed the measurement of d meson production to zero momentum  @xcite in pp and p  pb collisions . at mid - rapidity , these d mesons are virtually at rest and topological selection by means of a displaced vertex measurement is no longer applicable . rather than using vertexing at these ultra - low momenta , alice extracts the d meson yield by simply subtracting the large combinatorial background in the invariant mass spectrum of identified pions and kaons .",
    "this provides a precise experimental reference of the charm production cross section at mid - rapidity without any model dependence , which serves as an essential input to model calculations describing charmonium production at the phase boundary as a signal for deconfinement .",

    "transport models assume a reduction in the gluon density in each lead nucleus of up to 20% , resulting in an initial suppression factor of 0.64 in pb ",
    "pb collisions .",
    "various microscopic models are more or less able to describe the observed modification factor .",
    "while the @xmath3  values vary drastically between different models , none of them is able to consistently describe the nuclear modification factor for light- and heavy - flavor hadrons .",

    "[ cms - d0 ] . at low momentum , this measurement is restricted to above 2 @xmath4 . in the absence of particle identification ,",
    "all pairs of opposite charge have to be considered as d meson decay candidates , resulting in an overwhelming combinatorial background at low momentum .",
    "additionally , decay daughters from a d meson decay are identified as an anti - d meson when a kaon is mistaken for a pion and vice versa , leading to an irreducible correlated background .",
    "note that the pp reference was recorded over 3 days of data taking , with @xmath7 minimum bias pp collisions being inspected .",
    "this large statistical base may allow for other experiments with lower rate capabilities in pp collisions to use reference data from other detectors .    despite the cms measurements showing similar values of the @xmath3  for the 10% most central collisions when compared to minimum bias collisions ( 0 - 100% )",
    ", the centrality dependence of the @xmath3  can not be excluded .",
    "if binary collision scaling holds for charm production , the 10% most central collisions contain 40% of all d mesons in the minimum bias sample , and thus both measurements are largely correlated .",
    "indeed , the alice collaboration has already published results showing a distinct centrality dependence .",

    "as has been pointed out at this conference  @xcite , elastic collisions naturally lead to a mass hierarchy in suppression for simple kinematic reasons .",
    "it would be interesting to see whether these mass differences to disappear starting at @xmath10 , i.e. in a momentum range above 20 @xmath4 , where rest masses no longer matter . in order to address the collective flow of beauty quarks , these measurements",
    "should also be extended to low momenta .",
    "while alice has improved its precision in the charm production cross section by a factor two by measuring down to @xmath11  @xmath4 , star has superseded its measurement on the total charm production cross section in pp collisions at 200 gev by using run 12 data with a factor of 10 larger statistics sample , see fig .",
    "[ sigma - ccbar ] .",
    "the latter value has come down by a factor of two when compared to the first publication by star  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , now all experimental data sit at the upper end of results in perturbative qcd at next - to - leading order within the nmr framework .",
    "this might hint to a smaller actual charm quark mass than the central value of @xmath12 = 1.5 @xmath13  assumed in the calculations .",
    "a recent combined next - to - leading order qcd analysis of charm production in deep inelastic electron - proton scattering at hera using the @xmath14 running mass scheme determined a lower charm quark mass of @xmath15 1.26 @xmath13 . a reduced charm mass would implicitly enhance the cross section of gluons splitting into pairs of charm and anti - charm quarks .",
    "a deficit in gluon splitting processes to the production of charm has been reported at tevatron in the associated production of z bosons with charm quark jets and photon - tagged heavy - quark jets as well as at the lhc in the measurement of associated charm production in w final states  @xcite .",
