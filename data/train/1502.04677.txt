    "the static capacitance of a complex metallic structure is commonly considered to be a global quantity of the entire system and , consequently , is supposed to characterize the electronic state of the system rather insufficiently to deduce microscopic properties .",
    "however this is not always the case .",
    "for instance , recent experiments on polar oxide heterostructures with conducting laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interfaces suggest that the capacitance for these systems is a quantity which allows to draw distinct conclusions on the electronic interface state  @xcite .",
    "a special characteristic of this interface is that the electrons are subject to a sizeable spin - orbit coupling  @xcite .",
    "the question arises if spin - orbit coupling is a relevant control parameter for the capacitance of the interface .    here , we address the fundamental issue whether spin - orbit coupling of the interface electrons allows to modify the capacitance of the heterostructure significantly , and we estimate the spin - orbit contribution for systems based on laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interfaces .",
    "an enhancement of the capacitance is possible in the presence of a sufficiently large rashba - like spin - orbit coupling ( rsco ) , because the rsoc allows to alter the electronic band energies by controlling the charge carrier density .",
    "such a rsoc appears to explain magnetotransport measurements at laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interfaces  @xcite , and it has been shown within _ ab initio _ evaluations that a rsoc is generated by the electric field of the polar laalo@xmath0 layers on top of the srtio@xmath0 substrate  @xcite . the rsoc lowers the band edge quadratically with the spin orbit coupling parameter @xmath1 ( see fig .  [ dispersion ] ) .",
    "this even allows for a negative compressibility assuming that @xmath1 depends on the electric field @xmath2 of the polar laalo@xmath0 layers which in turn is related to the charge density at the laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interface  @xcite . with their spectacular result of a negative compressibility in the presence of a sizeable rsoc , the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite suggest that this provides an intrinisic mechanism for the inhomogeneous phases observed at laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interfaces  yet , other scenarios for phase separation at laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interfaces have also been investigated recently  @xcite .",
    "it is well known , that a negative electronic compressibility on one or both electrodes of a capacitor can lead to an enhancement of the capacitance beyond its geometrical value  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the geometric capacitance of a two - plate capacitor , @xmath3 , is modified by electronic contributions which are taken into account in the electronic compressibility of the plates @xmath4 , the derivative of the charge carrier density @xmath5 at plate @xmath6 with respect to the chemical potential @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 is the dielectric constant of the material between the two electrodes of area @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the thickness of the dielectric .",
    "the kinetic contributions to the capacitance were coined by luryi  @xcite as quantum capacitance .",
    "this notation may be extended to all electronic compressibility terms ( see ref .  ) .",
    "already in the early nineties , a capacitance enhancement of semiconductor heterostructures has been identified when the electronic compressibility of quantum hall systems was investigated  @xcite .",
    "the enhancement of the semiconductor capacitance could be traced quantitatively to the presence of quantum exchange effects in the electrodes .",
    "the contribution from electronic correlations to the capacitance is not negligible for very dilute electron systems  @xcite and for electronic systems close to half - filling  @xcite .",
    "however , the charge density at laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interfaces is in the intermediate range , neither as low as in the semiconductor systems  @xcite nor close to half - filling .",
    "therefore , the more sizeable capacitance enhancement of the oxide laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 heterostructure  @xcite and its negative compressibility  @xcite can not be explained exclusively by exchange and correlation effects and other mechanisms might become relevant .",
    "-space for @xmath11 ( left , only the lowest band is occupied ) and for @xmath12 ( right , both bands are occupied ) . ]    to determine the thermodynamic electronic compressibility , two alternative procedures are conceivable : ( i ) one can either consider the interface subsystem with an _ external _ electric field which induces the rsoc .",
    "in order to identify the electronic compressibility of the interface electrons , one has to keep the electric field fixed in thermodynamic derivatives . or",
    "( ii ) , one evaluates the compressibility for the entire electronic system , for which the rsoc - generating field is an _ internal _ field .",
    "a scheme in the sense of ( i ) has been suggested by the authors of ref .",
    "there the electric field was set as a function of the interface charge carrier density @xmath13 and , then , the inverse compressibility was identified from the derivative of the chemical potential @xmath14 with respect to @xmath13 , keeping any dependence else fixed .",
    "we disagree with this approach because there the electric field has to be kept fixed and therefore does not contribute to the compressibility  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we establish the second procedure ( ii ) and relate the electronic compressibility of the entire electronic system directly to the capacitance of the device  consisting of the interface , dielectrics , and the surface of the laalo@xmath0 film or a metallic top electrode .",
    "as indicated above , previous investigations focused on the interface subsystem  @xcite , whereas we consider the entire system .",
    "for realistic values of the rsoc , we identify a positive compressibility for the most part of the parameter space indicating that the system is thermodynamically stable . nevertheless , we find an increased capacitance with respect to its geometrical value , the capacitance enhancement being caused by the rsoc in the metallic interface .    in this article",
    ", we will investigate two different models , both building on a two - dimensional ( 2d ) metallic system in which a rsoc modifies the electronic state : first we analyze a capacitor with two metallic planes , where the top electrode is a 2d or 3d metal ( gate ) and the second plane is the interface between a polar and non - polar insulator .",
    "the interface attains a metallic state with rsoc upon charge transfer from the top plate to the interface and the concomitant build - up of an internal electric field .",
    "finally we study a two - layer system with the spin - orbit coupling controlled by the filling of three @xmath15-orbitals at the interface .",
    "we will show that the multilayered system has a range of parameters where it has a positive total compressibility , but its capacitance is enhanced above its geometrical value on account of the spin - orbit coupling in the metallic interface plane . in this analysis",
    "we adjust the parameters to those specific for laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 ( lao / sto ) heterostructures in order to explore the feasibility of spin - orbit controlled capacitance enhancement with a polar dielectric material .",
    "in a 2d free electron system subject to a rashba spin - orbit coupling ( rsoc ) @xmath16 , with coupling constant @xmath17 , the dispersion @xmath18 is given by ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the density of states for both spin directions in the absence of rsoc , @xmath1 defines the strength of the rsoc , and @xmath21 is the effective mass of the charge carriers .",
    "the rsoc is made possible by the absence of inversion symmetry , caused by an electric field perpendicular to the two - dimensional layer containing the electrons with areal density @xmath13 .",
    "the spin - orbit splitting of the dispersion , eq .",
    "( [ rsocdispersion ] ) , is shown in fig .",
    "[ dispersion ] .",
    "if @xmath22 , only the lower band is occupied and the fermi surface is an annulus ; for @xmath23 the two occupied bands yield two concentric circles in @xmath24-space .",
    "as the lowest energy @xmath25 of the dispersion is proportional to the strength of the rsoc , it decreases with increasing strength of the symmetry breaking electrical field .",
    "thus a stronger electrical field lowers the chemical potential for constant electron density @xmath13 . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was suggested that a negative compressibility can be obtained from exploiting this effect .",
    "the inverse compressibility is obtained by the second derivative of the free energy @xmath26 per area with respect to the electron density _ with all external variables held fixed_. since the symmetry breaking electrical field ( sbef ) is an external variable in this scheme ( and the field generated by the electrons in the plane themselves is symmetric ) , @xmath1 is independent of @xmath13 in the thermodynamic derivatives , and there is no dependence of the compressibility on the rsoc .",
    "here we propose an extended scheme in which the electric field from the polar film , and consequently the rsoc , is an internal parameter , i.e. , a quantity that depends on the electron density @xmath13 .",
    "then the density dependence of @xmath27 has to be accounted for when taking the derivative of the energy for the compressibility .",
    "in addition to the interface layer with a finite rsoc ( l0 ) , a second layer ( l1 ) , e.g. , the surface of the lao film in the lao / sto heterostructure , comprising electrons and a positive background charge , is placed parallel at a distance @xmath10 . eventually , both layers  each of them electrically neutral  are connected .",
    "since typically both layers had different electrochemical potentials , electrons will be exchanged between l0 and l1 until both layers are on the same electrochemical potential .",
    "it is of no relevance for the static capacitance how electronic charge is transferred between the plates .",
    "however , an electric field , which is proportional to the transferred amount of charge , is generated .",
    "this internal field breaks the inversion symmetry and thus generates rsoc in the respective layer .",
    "it stands to reason that also the electrons in the surface layer l1 experience a rsoc because the same electric field acts on the electronic states in l1 . in the case of a bare rsoc @xmath28 in @xmath29 for free electrons with mass @xmath30 , momentum @xmath31 and spin @xmath32 in a plane subject to a transverse electrical field @xmath33",
    ", a reasoning demanding an equivalent treatment of layers l0 and l1 with respect to the rsoc appears to be appropriate .",
    "however , the bare rsoc with electric fields generated by the charged layers is orders of magnitude too small to have sizeable impact on the electronic reconstruction in the heterostructures . the resolution of this apparent unfeasibility of bare rsoc effects",
    "has already been established for semiconductor heterostructures ( see the book by r.  winkler  @xcite for a comprehensive treatment ) and is implemented for the lao / sto interfaces as follows  @xcite : the ti - ions provide an atomic soc , whereas an internal electric field which displaces the ti - ions slightly out of their in - plane positions , couples the three @xmath15 orbitals . as spin and orbital space couple , one has to diagonalize six bands .",
    "the diagonalization of the 6-band system generates a soc of rashba type @xmath34 ( see eq .",
    "( [ rsocdispersion ] ) ) even though only the lowest of the @xmath15 bands ( the @xmath35 ) may be partially occupied .",
    "the rsoc parameter @xmath1 has to be estimated from electronic structure evaluations  @xcite .",
    "in fact , from magnetotransport measurements , a sizeable rsoc has been identified for the lao / sto interface electronic state ( @xmath36 for different backgate voltages ) , where the value of @xmath37 depends on the charge carrier density which is controlled by the internal electric field . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3band ] we will address the 6-band situation explicitly . until then we consider an effective two - band situation with a rsoc that is controlled by the internal field that depends in turn on the charge density .",
    "the actual set - up for the electronic surface states ( layer l1 ) is very different and soc effects have so far not been found to be relevant .",
    "therefore we disregard rsoc in the surface layer l1 in our approach .    through the mechanism outlined above , the strength of the induced rsoc , @xmath1 , becomes density dependent : we denote the helmholtz free energies of the single layers as @xmath38 and @xmath39 , calculated in the first stage without connection between l0 and l1 .",
    "in fact , we calculate the single layer grand canonical energies and then use a legendre transformation to obtain the helmholtz free energies .",
    "the total free energy of the connected system @xmath40 is the sum of the single layer energies and the electrostatic term @xmath41 .",
    "the total energy @xmath42 is a function of the total density @xmath43 only , that is , the sum of both single layer densities : the dependence on the single layer densities is eliminated by the condition that @xmath13 has to minimize the total free energy , which is equivalent to the equality of the electrochemical potentials of both layers .",
    "note that , as the layers are connected , @xmath44 becomes a function of the electric field generated by l1 and thus of @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "since both layers are coupled through the electric field and are supposed to be in electrical contact , only the inverse compressibility of the total system @xmath47 is a well - defined thermodynamic quantity . here",
    ", @xmath48 is an appropriate legendre transform of @xmath49 with respect to the interface charge density @xmath13 : the thermodynamic variable is then the voltage bias @xmath50 between interface and surface ( see appendix  [ appcompandcap ] ) .",
    "the electronic compressibility derives from the second derivative of the electronic energy with respect to the volume . in the case of two - dimensional electron systems",
    "( as in the considered heterostructure ) it is the area instead of the volume .",
    "this translates into the second derivative with respect to the electronic areal density @xmath45 .",
    "the second derivative in eq .",
    "( [ kappa ] ) is to be taken with respect to the total dependence on @xmath45 , that is , also the @xmath45 dependence of the internal field in the polar film enters .",
    "the positivity of @xmath51 then represents a stability criterion with respect to charge separation in the plane directions .",
    "to approach a polar system with a surface and an interface to a non - polar insulator , we first present a model system that consists of three two - dimensional layers ( fig .  [ electrostatic](a ) ) but only two of them comprise mobile electrons : the planes at the bottom and at the top have areal charge densities of @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "the electrons may be transferred between these two planes to minimize the free energy , while the plane sandwiched between them  with a distance @xmath54 to the bottom and @xmath55 to the top  holds immobile , fixed charges of density @xmath45 .",

    "the former yields the kinetic term in the quantum capacitance and is known to produce a slightly increased effective distance between the electrodes ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
