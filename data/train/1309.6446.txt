    "indium nitride ( inn ) has received considerable attention in recent years due to its direct bandgap in the infrared range@xcite and the high electron mobilities.@xcite the possibility of fabricating low - dimensional structures such as nanowires ( nws)@xcite makes desirable the simulation of the electronic structure and optical properties of these system with atomistic approaches . _",
    "ab initio_-based calculations are in principle capable of reproducing the band structure of bulk and systems of few atoms with a great accuracy . however , the computational time turns out to be a limiting factor if the number of atoms increases , making this methods impractical for the study of dependencies with the size and composition ( alloying ) of the system .",
    "however , the valuable _ ab initio _ information can be used for the development of empirical tight - binding ( tb)@xcite or pseudopotential@xcite methods .",
    "these approaches are expected to describe with good precision the optical properties of both bulk and small systems , and at the same time , to allow quantitative studies of large systems in reasonable computational times . moreover , as opposed to the approaches based on the effective mass approximation ( ema ) , the empirical atomistic methods are able to incorporate the true symmetry of the nanostructures.@xcite    _ ab initio _ methods have been widely employed for the study of inn ( see e.g. refs . and ) .",
    "in particular it has been shown that in order to get a correct description of its band structure close to the @xmath0 point within the density functional theory ( dft ) it is important to repair the deficiency of local density approximation ( lda ) or generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) functional in describing the coulomb interaction between the localized @xmath1 electrons of indium . to this end , various approaches have been built on the dft basis and , among others we mention the self - interaction correction methods@xcite and the lda with the hubbard @xmath2 correction ( lda+u).@xcite in our work , we adopt an lda+u approach , which has been recently discussed and applied to the case of inn.@xcite beyond dft calculations , the gw methods provides good estimation of the nitrides band gap , opening it up the experimental value . however , this method is computationally more complex than lda+u , making difficult its application in large systems.@xcite    among the various empirical approaches , we have chosen to work with the tight - binding method , that has demonstrated its applicability in iii -",
    "n nanowires.@xcite moreover , this method allows to deal easily with the problem of the dangling bonds at the free surface of the nanowires,@xcite and gives an intuitive physical picture of the wave functions in terms of the atomic orbitals .",
    "the tb parameters are obtained by fitting the lda+u bulk band structure to some selected points of the brillouin zone , with special care in a faithful description of the neighborhood of the top of the valence band , because of its dominant role in the determination of the optical properties .",
    "since there is no _ a priori _ guaranty of the transferability of the fitted tb parameters for their use in nanostructures calculations , we have compared the band structure of a small inn nanowire ( diameter 16.2  ) calculated with the lda+u and tb approaches , and obtain a very good agreement .",
    "the use of this empirical tight - binding model in larger inn nanowires has been illustrated by calculating the dependence of the confinement energy on the nw size , and the polarization dependence optical spectra for a nanowire size beyond the range accessible by _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "inn has been studied by employing dft - lda@xcite calculations with on - site hubbard @xmath2 correction ( lda+u ) , using ultra - soft pseudopotentials as realized in quantum espresso,@xcite and expanding the electronic wave functions in plane waves . to describe correctly the structural properties of inn ,",
    "the 4@xmath1 electrons of the indium are explicitly considered as valence electrons.@xcite for all calculations , the plane wave cutoff is 30  ry , and a ( 8@xmath38@xmath38 ) monkhorst - pack mesh is used .",
    "it is known that lda and gga underestimate the binding energy of the cation semicore @xmath1 states and overestimate their hybridization with the anion @xmath4 valence states . as a result ,",
    "an artificially large @xmath4-@xmath1 coupling pushes up the valence band maximum reducing the calculated band gap ; in particular , in the case of inn , dft - lda gives null or negative band gap ( the experimental band gap is @xmath50.67 ev @xcite ) . in this work we use the lda+u@xcite method to correct this deficiency .",
    "to describe correctly the main inn band features , we have applied the @xmath2 correction both to indium 4@xmath1 electrons and to nitrogen 2@xmath4 electrons .",
    "we note that in the case of inn , similarly to some oxides compounds,@xcite the inclusion of the u correction on the anion ( the n @xmath4-shell ) is important for a better description of @xmath4-@xmath1 interaction and , besides inducing the band gap opening , it gives the correct symmetry of the states close to the top of the valence band .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction is not taken into account in these calculations .",
    "the selected u parameters are @xmath6=6.0  ev for in , @xmath7=1.5  ev for n , as discussed in details elsewhere.@xcite within this computational scheme , we obtained equilibrium lattice parameters for inn bulk in the wurtzite structure of @xmath8   , @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "these values are close to the experimental data ( @xmath11   , @xmath12 , @xmath13 @xcite ) . in fig .",
    "[ comp_bulk ]  ( a ) the band structure for the inn bulk is presented : the band gap at @xmath0 is 0.34 ev , the valence band width is about 6.3  ev and the 4@xmath1 indium states lie 16  ev below the valence band maximum ( vbm ) .",
    "the bandgap becomes positive but it is still underestimated as compared with the experimental value .",
    "another remarkable improvement with respect to lda consists of the correct description of the energy level ordering and symmetry at the top of the valence band , which are essential to derive reliable tb parameters .",
    ".tb parameters ( in ev ) of inn proposed in this work .",
    "we follow the standard tb notation also used in ref . .",

    "it is known that a better description of the conduction bands far from the @xmath0 point would require at least the use of an @xmath16.@xcite however , we will focus our study in the optical properties near @xmath0 , and to keep the number of fitting parameters reduced , we avoid the addition of the @xmath17 excited orbital . as we only include",
    "interaction between nearest neighbors , the crystal - field splitting at the top of the valence band can not be reproduced , since this is an effect caused by the interaction with second and third neighbors .",
    "this limitation is corrected by the introduction of one ad - hoc asymmetry between @xmath18 and @xmath19 orbitals.@xcite moreover , the deviation from the ideal wurtzite has been introduced with the harrison s rule , applied to the interatomic parameters:@xcite    @xmath20    where @xmath1 is the relaxed lda+u distance , @xmath21 the ideal wurtzite distance , and @xmath22 an exponent that depends on the orbital . in most of the literature , the accepted value for the exponent is around 2,@xcite although some authors make a discretionary use of such exponents in order to obtain a good description of the band structure under deformation ( see ref . ) or a better agreement over the whole brillouin zone ( see in ref . ) . in an attempt to limit the number of additional parameters we restrict the @xmath22 to be different only for the overlap @xmath23 . a optimized set of tb parameters fitted with this procedure against the lda+u band structure",
    "is shown in table  [ table_etb ] , and the corresponding tb band structure is represented in fig .",
    "[ comp_bulk ]  ( b ) .",
    "nevertheless , the bandgap has been fixed to the experimental value.@xcite the obtained valence band reproduces well the lda+u results .",
    "the discrepancies at around -6 ev below the top of the valence band are attributed to the small basis set used in the @xmath15 tb method.@xcite    in fig .",
    "[ zoom_tb ] we report the details of the top of the valence band at @xmath0 , comparing lda+u ( open circles ) with tb calculations ( lines ) , along the @xmath24 and @xmath25 directions .",
    "we observe a very accurate fitting for the a - c bands , whereas the b - band shows a slight deviation for @xmath26 in the @xmath27 direction . along the @xmath24 direction ,",
    "a and b bands are degenerate and both calculations match perfectly .",
    "the anti - crossing between b and c bands is also well captured by the tb method .",
    "the tb effective mass of the top of the valence band at @xmath0 are @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . regarding the symmetry of the wave functions at @xmath0,@xcite the degenerate states belong to the representation @xmath34 .",
    "they have a pure composition of @xmath35 and @xmath36 orbitals , that coincides with both lda+u and tb results .",
    "the second state in energy belongs to the representation @xmath37 , being here 100 % @xmath19 for both calculations .",
    "note that the bottom of the conduction band state also belongs to this representation , although the predominant orbital is in this case @xmath38-type .",
    "the tb conduction effective masses are @xmath39 and @xmath40 , in agreement with the data of ref . .",
    "the achieved good agreement at @xmath0 is of special relevance for the eventual use of the tb band structure in the analysis of optical and transport experiments .",
    "to asses the behavior of the tb parametrization in nanostructures , a comparison between the electronic states , calculated with lda+u and tb approaches , has been performed , for a thin nw .",
    "afterwards , a study in larger nws with the tb method has been carried out , by exploring the bandgap evolution with the nws diameter and examining the optical response for a selected diameter .",
    "the nanowire employed in the comparison has a diameter of 16.2  ( see sketch in the left upper part of fig . [ comp_nw ] ) , and the dangling bonds at the free surfaces are passivated with hydrogen atoms in order to avoid the presence of surface states within the gap.@xcite in the _ ab initio _ calculation , the nanowire structure has been fully optimized until forces on atoms are less than 0.001 ry / bohr per atom .",
    "we use a monkhorst - pack mesh of 6 points for the one dimensional nanowire brillouin zone .",
    "the indium and nitrogen atoms placed at the surface modify slightly its tetragonal bond due to the presence of the passivant hydrogen atoms , changing slightly their interatomic distances .",
    "this surface reconstruction is not taken into account in the tb calculation , which assumes a perfect wurtzite everywhere.@xcite the topmost valence band states , labeled in increasing energy as @xmath41 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ comp_nw ] ( ( a ) lda+u and ( b ) tb method ) .",
    "the states @xmath42 to @xmath43 are within a range of 150 mev in both calculation .",
    "the tb result yields in addition the value of -130 mev for the confinement energy of the states @xmath42 and @xmath44 with respect to the top of bulk valence band . in the case of the lda+u calculation",
    ", the degeneracy between @xmath42 and @xmath44 is broken due to the exact consideration of the atomic distances when we relax the structure , an effect that the tb method ignores ( such splitting has the small value of 3 mev ) . in any case , the portion of the band structure framed by a dashed green line , that contains the @xmath42 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 sub - bands , exhibit a remarkable similarity in both calculations . in particular , the curvature of the bands are identical and only a slight difference between the @xmath42 and @xmath45 states ( 26 mev and 18 mev for lda+u and tb calculation , respectively ) is observed . concerning the @xmath43 state",
    ", one can perceive that is closer in energy to @xmath45 in the tb calculations than in the lda+u approximation . despite that energy",
    "is underestimated , @xmath43 has the same curvature in both approaches .",
    "another difference between both methods is the existence of more states in the range of -150 mev from the state @xmath42 , in the case of tb valence band . in order to exclude the relaxation as a source of error in our comparison ,",
    "calculations with lda+u in a nanowire , assuming perfect wurtzite everywhere were performed , without finding any substantial difference .    in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ comp_nw ] we show the square of the @xmath0 wave function , @xmath46 , for the valence band states , @xmath42 to @xmath43 .",
    "the tb wave function can be expressed as :    @xmath47    here the index @xmath48 runs over atoms and @xmath49 over orbitals . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", the orbitals are represented here with the hydrogen wave functions that share the same symmetry.@xcite figure  [ comp_nw ] shows that the density is localized on the indium and nitrogen atoms , without spreading on the hydrogen atoms .",
    "the first two degenerate valence band states ( @xmath42 and @xmath44 ) exhibit the electron density elongated along two perpendicular directions ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) .",
    "moreover , by looking closely to the density of each atom , it is evident that it comes from the @xmath35 and @xmath36 orbitals , for the @xmath50-elongated ( @xmath42 ) and @xmath51-elongated ( @xmath44 ) states , respectively . in the next valence band state ,",
    "@xmath45 , the wave function is notably confined at the center of the nw , being the @xmath19-orbital component predominant . in the case of the @xmath43 state , we find that the wave function has a node in the nanowire center , and a mixed composition of @xmath18 orbitals",
    ". one can distinguish that tb charge densities are more delocalized towards the nw surface if compared to the lda+u picture .",
    "even so , tb method reproduces exactly the qualitative features of the charge density in terms of symmetry and orbital composition .",
    "the observed differences are acceptable because of the restricted tb basis and the small sizes of the nw . for larger nws",
    ", these small differences between the tb method and the lda+u approximation are expected to be attenuated .",
    "we thus conclude that the tb parameters obtained and tested here are suitable to be used in the calculation of optical properties of inn - based nanostructures .    once demonstrated the reliability of the tb approach and the quality of the parameters , we have performed tb calculations for larger nws . in the first place , we show in fig .",
    "[ gap_size ] the confinement energy , defined as the difference between the nanowire and bulk bandgap , versus @xmath52 , being @xmath53 the nw radius .",

    "the confinement energy calculated with the effective mass approximation , assuming parabolic bands , is :    @xmath54    @xmath55 , being the first zero of the bessel function @xmath56 , and the effective masses are reported in sec .",
    "[ bulk ] . for large radii ,",
    "when @xmath57  @xmath58 , the tb method and the ema follow the same trend , proportional to @xmath59 . for decreasing radii ( @xmath60  @xmath58 ) ema overestimate the confinement energy as compared with the tb results , that changes in this range the @xmath61 behavior to @xmath62 .",
    "moreover , the tb results connect perfectly with the _ ab initio _ computed values , represented by full squares , at radii 8.1   and 5.1   .",
    "this smooth interpolation confirms the suitability of the tb method to link the nws size ranges of 10   , where _ ab initio _ are practical and 100   , where the ( ema ) start to be applicable . in this intermediate size",
    "range the tb approach has the advantages of keeping the atomistic nature of the system and be efficient in terms of computational effort .    in addition",
    "the tb method offers the possibility of calculating the optical absorption spectra without introducing new parameters in the model .",
    "the absorption coefficient for light with polarization vector @xmath63 can be written as:@xcite    @xmath64    where we integrate over the one - dimensional brillouin zone , and the oscillator strength is calculated as :    @xmath65    the momentum matrix element , @xmath66 , is calculated as in ref .  , for two light polarizations : in - plane ( perpendicular to nw axis ) , @xmath67 , and in - axis ( parallel to nw axis ) , @xmath68 .",

    ", one can appreciate that absorption edge does not take place at the energy of the fundamental bandgap ( corresponding to the transition @xmath71 ) .",

    "the absorption edge of the @xmath69 spectra is shifted 24 mev with respect the @xmath70 spectra , since the first state with significant @xmath19 orbital component is @xmath73 .",
