    "aggregation of particles and particle clusters is still of great interest not only due to the number of applications it has in chemical engineering , material sciences , and atmosphere research but also due to its fundamental role as a simple model system for growth under non - equilibrium conditions  @xcite .",
    "the effects of the interplay of diffusive and ballistic motion in the case of fractal aggregates has been considered only recently  @xcite .",
    "the relative strength of these two mechanisms will vary with cluster size .",
    "this is the case , for example , in colloidal suspensions , where both the diffusivity and the sedimentation velocity are usually expected to depend algebraically on cluster size . in this paper",
    "we study the effect of these two processes on the cluster structure .",
    "the present understanding of colloidal aggregation under gravitation is as follows .",
    "according to experiments  @xcite sedimenting clusters do not rotate , their anisotropy is independent of their size , and they have no preferred orientation . based on a scaling relationship between cluster size and sedimentation velocity the sedimenting clusters are argued to be self - similar and their fractal dimension to be significantly larger than that in diffusion - limited aggregation .",
    "the restructuring of particles inside a cluster caused by hydrodynamic stresses was claimed to be the reason for sedimenting clusters being more compact .",
    "recent simulations  @xcite have shown that even without restructuring it is possible to produce clusters with an apparent fractal dimension that is close to the value observed in experiments , if there is a velocity difference between clusters of different sizes .",
    "the cross - over to the sedimentation - dominated regime can be measured by directly observing the average size of the aggregates ; however in this regime the fractal dimension still follows dlca - like scaling @xcite .    in this article",
    "we study scaling properties of clusters , which are formed in cluster - cluster aggregation when both the diffusivity and the sedimentation velocity depend algebraically on cluster size .",
    "this induces a cross - over from diffusion - limited aggregation to a process where large clusters grow while settling by aggregating smaller clusters from a time - dependent size distribution , @xmath2 .",
    "we are mainly interested in generic features and hence concentrate on two dimensions , in which the effects of sedimentation on cluster structure can be studied with the most ease numerically . to compare our results to the existing ones , we also consider other structural characteristics on a qualitative level . for quantitative studies one should study more elaborate models with hydrodynamics and other delicate issues involved .",
    "the main focus here is on the self - similarity of aggregates , which is the crucial assumption made in the analysis of data in previous , similar studies . for this purpose",
    ", we consider the scaling of four radii as a function of cluster size .",
    "these are indicated in figure  [ illustrationfig ] .",
    "and @xmath3 calculated from the radius of gyration matrix @xmath4 and the radii @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which point perpendicular and parallel to the sedimentation velocity ( shown by the thick arrow ) , respectively .",
    "the longer side of the rectangle shown equals to the maximal distance between any of the particles of the cluster and the angles @xmath7 and @xmath8 are used to measure the orientation with respect to the direction of the sedimentation velocity . ]",
    "our main result is that _ sedimenting clusters are not self - similar fractals_. hence , an algebraic relationship - as assumed a priori here - between cluster velocity and its mass does not necessarily imply self - similarity of the aggregates .",
    "the mean cluster width , considered in the direction perpendicular to the sedimentation velocity , grows algebraically as a function of cluster size but the mean cluster height does not follow a simple power - law , at least not in the size range considered .",
    "it is an open question as to whether the asymptotic scaling of the clusters transverse to the velocity follows the mean cluster width , or , vice versa ; much larger simulations are needed to settle this issue .",
    "also the principal radii of gyration , given by the eigenvalues of the radius of gyration matrix ( see fig .",
    "[ illustrationfig ] and eq .  ) , grow with rates that are not equal .",
    "we present a scaling argument that explains how the width grows algebraically but simultaneously leaves the origin of the actual value of the exponent open .",
    "the fact that this particular quantity exhibits scaling brings up some interesting issues , like where does the universal , peclet - number independent value originate from ?",
    "the difference in the growth rates indicates that clusters can not be described simply using the fractal dimension and methods relying on isotropic scaling properties .",
    "for example , studies using the radius of gyration give only an effective measure for the cluster structure .",
    "anisotropic growth also implies that the cluster shape and its structure change in time , and we consider the former in particular in detail .",
    "we also analyze the orientation of clusters and discuss the similarities and differences between our results and previous experimental and numerical studies of the same phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model is defined in section  [ model_sec ] .",
    "a simulation method becoming the efficient the larger clusters become is introduced in section  [ compasp_sec ] . the scaling properties using the radius of gyration matrix are studied in section  [ scalprop_sec ] .",
    "section  [ shape_sec ] considers the anisotropy and orientation of clusters .",
    "section  [ conc_sec ] concludes the paper .",
    "consider fractal clusters aggregating in a suspension .",
    "the sedimentation caused by gravitation may be ignored for aggregates with characteristic radii smaller than about 1  @xmath9 m . in this region the essential features of the growth are well described by the diffusion - limited cluster - cluster aggregation  ( dlca ) model  @xcite .",
    "the idea is that clusters move diffusively , and the diffusion constant depends algebraically on cluster size : @xmath10 . for a cluster diffusing in a quiescent fluid",
    "it can be argued that the diffusion exponent @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the fractal dimension of the cluster  @xcite .",
    "whenever clusters ( particles are clusters of size one ) collide , they irreversibly aggregate together .",
    "no cluster restructuring is allowed .",
    "both the dynamics and the structure of clusters formed in the dlca are well understood  @xcite . defining the number of clusters of size @xmath13 at time",
    "@xmath14 as @xmath2 , the cluster size distribution obeys dynamic scaling @xmath15 , where the exponent @xmath16 follows from mass conservation and the average cluster size @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the dynamic exponent . in two dimensions the fractal dimension of clusters is @xmath19  @xcite and including rotational diffusion or varying the value of @xmath20 has no essential effect on it  @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy measured using the ratio of the principal axis of gyration is about @xmath21  @xcite .    here the dlca model is considered in the presence of the sedimentation of clusters .",
    "the force exerted on a cluster sedimenting in a fluid consists of the buoyancy force @xmath22 and the viscous drag force @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the volume of the object ( for an aggregate consisting of @xmath13 particles it is @xmath13 times the volume of a single particle ) , @xmath25 is the difference between particle and fluid densities , @xmath26 is the acceleration due to gravity , @xmath27 is the sedimentation velocity and @xmath28 is a positive constant depending on the specific form of the cluster  @xcite . for a ball of radius @xmath29 the constant @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the kinematic viscosity .",
    "for complicated , say fractal - like objects , @xmath28 is generally unknown and we make the usual assumption that the aggregate will behave as a compact object with an effective hydrodynamic radius @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath33  @xcite . if one further assumes a scaling relation between @xmath32 and @xmath13 , the sedimentation velocity depends algebraically on cluster size @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the sedimentation exponent . for a fractal one would have @xmath36 resulting in @xmath37 but here",
    "we just take this as an assumption since it is not a priori clear that the ensuing clusters are fractals with respect to drag resistance . as @xmath38 and @xmath39 aggregation is diffusion - limited for small clusters but",
    "becomes dominated by sedimentation for large ones .",
    "the model described above neglects many issues related to real suspensions such as hydrodynamic interactions , restructuring and rotation of clusters by diffusion or at aggregation to mention a few .",
    "however , our purpose is not to try to simulate all aspects of sedimentation driven aggregation but rather elucidate what kind of universal behavior one could expect to have .",
    "hence , the results reported should be considered on a qualitative level when comparing to experiments .",
    "we discuss further these issues and the assumptions behind @xmath20 and @xmath35 in the conclusions , in the light of the simulation results obtained .",
    "a useful measure for the relative strengths of diffusion and sedimentation is the peclet number  @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath29 is the radius of a single particle and @xmath41 . as the peclet number depends on cluster size , in the following we use the one particle peclet number @xmath42 .",
    "figure  [ exampleclusters ] shows examples of clusters formed in simulations for different values of @xmath43 .",
    "the simulations are done on a two - dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "initially a concentration @xmath44 of lattice sites are filled randomly .",
    "one filled lattice site is considered as a single particle . in the dynamics a particle or a cluster consisting of particles",
    "is selected randomly and time is incremented by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the number of clusters at time @xmath14 and @xmath47 is the maximum mobility of any of the clusters at that time .",
    "the cluster mobility is defined as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 are proportional to the probabilities for a cluster of size @xmath13 to move in the direction of the field , opposite to it and to the directions perpendicular to it , respectively . the selected cluster ( of size @xmath13 )",
    "is moved if @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is a random number selected from a uniform distribution . if the selected cluster is not moved the simulation proceeds by selecting another cluster , otherwise another random number @xmath54 is selected from a uniform distribution .",
    "the cluster is moved to the field direction if @xmath55 , opposite to the field direction if @xmath56/\\omega(s)$ ] , and otherwise to one of the directions perpendicular to the field with equal probabilities ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "if after the move the cluster has no overlap with others the move is accepted and another cluster is selected randomly .",
    "otherwise the move is taken back and the cluster is aggregated with all the clusters it attempted to overlap before selecting a new cluster for the next attempt .",
    "the terms @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 are of the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 are non - negative constants chosen such that @xmath62 for all cluster sizes .",
    "this choice gives for the sedimentation velocity @xmath63 and for the diffusivities @xmath64 and @xmath65 , in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the field , respectively . in the following we consider only the case @xmath66 and",
    "denote @xmath67 .",
    "physically , only the ratio of the sedimentation velocity to the diffusion constant is relevant and hence we report the results as a function of the one particle peclet number @xmath68 .",
    "the exponents are taken to be @xmath69 and @xmath70 , which are obtained from relations @xmath71 and @xmath72 using the fractal dimension of dlca clusters @xmath73 .",
    "this is of course a valid choice initially , when dlca is the dominating process .",
    "it should be underlined that the main point in these values is that eventually sedimentation will prevail , and that the both transfer mechanisms obey an algebraic dependence on the cluster size @xmath13 .",
    "it is known that in dlca cluster structure , and especially the effectuve fractal dimension , depends on concentration  @xcite . in simulations reported here , the concentration is kept fixed to @xmath74 .",
    "the dlca calculations are done on a lattice of size @xmath75 and when sedimentation is included @xmath76 unless stated otherwise . to minimize finite size effects",
    ", all the simulations are run under the conditions that none of the particles has traveled the size of the lattice in the sedimentation direction and the size of the largest clusters is smaller than half of the lattice size in any direction .",
    "the above choice for @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 assumes that sedimentation does not have any effect on the diffusion properties of a cluster .",
    "this may not be the case as the velocity fluctuations of sedimenting , compact , and non - aggregating particles are larger in the sedimentation direction than perpendicular to it  @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the strength of fluctuations on aggregate size is unknown , so we make the choice of isotropic fluctuations .",
    "the precise form of fluctuations should be unimportant as the upper critical dimension for sedimentation driven aggregation is expected to be one  @xcite .",
    "next we shortly discuss the implementation of the algorithm .",
    "it is constructed to be efficient for low concentrations and for large cluster sizes .",
    "although the method is described using a two - dimensional lattice , the generalization to higher dimensions and the continuum case is straightforward .    each cluster",
    "is represented by a virtual rectangle , whose size is the smallest possible one to enclose the cluster such that two sides of the rectangle are parallel to the sedimentation velocity ( see fig .",
    "[ exampleclusters ] ) .",
    "the sites belonging to a cluster are stored with respect to the , say , lower left corner of the enclosing rectangle , for two reasons . the first one is to minimize the time needed to move a cluster .",
    "regardless of the cluster size a move can be performed by updating one single value i.e. either the @xmath77- or @xmath78-coordinate of the lower left corner of the enclosing rectangle . the second reason deals with the collisions of clusters .",
    "it is fast first to check if the rectangles overlap each other and only if they do to check for the overlap of the clusters .",
    "obviously it would be very time - consuming to compare the rectangle that is moved to all the other rectangles .",
    "hence , the whole system is divided into rectangular blocks and clusters are identified to belong into blocks according to the rectangles enclosing them .",
    "then only clusters belonging to the same block(s ) have to be checked .",
    "figure  [ cputimecomparison ] compares cpu - times using the implementation described above to that with a `` traditional '' algorithm , where clusters are represented as occupied sites on a lattice and moved site by site . for average cluster size smaller than about ten",
    "the traditional algorithm is faster as one needs only to compare the occupancy of a few sites . on the other hand , for large clusters",
    "the method using enclosing rectangles becomes much faster , being independent of cluster size , and usually only a couple of comparisons are needed to check the overlap of a cluster with others . in the `` traditional '' implementation one needs of order @xmath79 comparisons , which slows down the computation considerably when @xmath79 becomes large .    in the simulations reported here",
    "the `` traditional '' method is used for @xmath80 and the `` rectangle '' one for @xmath81 .",
    "hence , most of the computation time is used when the average cluster size is small . to obtain good statistics from the interesting , large cluster size region ,",
    "we further apply a cloning method .",
    "it has proved to be efficient in many applications including , for example , studies of percolation clusters , native states of polymers , and reaction - diffusion systems  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is simple : at a fixed average cluster size @xmath82 one makes @xmath83 copies of the cluster configuration and continues the monte carlo simulation independently for each of these systems .",
    "we use @xmath84 .",
    "we tested that the results obtained using copying were indistinguishable from the ones obtained without it .",
    "the averages reported in this article are taken over @xmath85 runs without copying and @xmath86 runs which were copied @xmath86 times . to increase the scaling window further",
    "would necessitate enormous cpu resources ; even with the algorithm presented above we estimate that to augment the maximum cluster size by one order of magnitude would require of the order of one cpu - year on a fast computer .",
    "note that in the range of @xmath13-values shown , the typical scaling of @xmath79 is not algebraic manifesting a cross - over from diffusive to sedimentation - dominated dynamics @xcite .",
    "since in the asymptotic regime the mean - field dynamic exponent @xmath87 , for any reasonable value of @xmath88 ( the effective fractal dimension ) @xmath18 will have a value much larger than unity , and the cross - over effects are noticeable since the dlca value is much smaller .    ) and rectangle-algorithms ( @xmath89 ) .",

    "complex aggregates are often characterized be their fractal dimension @xmath12 , which can be found by the relation of the cluster size to its characteristic radius @xmath90 where the brackets denote averaging over clusters of size @xmath13 .",
    "usually one considers the radius of gyration @xmath91 where @xmath92 denotes the position of the @xmath93th particle and @xmath94 is the center of mass of the cluster .    as the field breaks the rotational symmetry it is not obvious that clusters will scale isotropically .",

    "has to consider the scaling using the radius of gyration matrix [ eq .  ] or some other observable not relaying on isotropic scaling .",
    "one should emphasize that for all @xmath125 any asymptotic behavior is still far away in the range of accessible radii of gyration ; the actual values reflect more the cross - over in the cluster shape and internal structure ( density ) than a tendency to e.g. become compact in the limit @xmath126 .",
    "this can be underlined by comparing with the scaling of the quantities , in figs .",
    "[ radii_max_min_etc_pe1 ] and [ radii_max_min_etc_pe10 ] .",
    "the reasons for the existence or lack of scaling with respect to @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be considered by a simple scaling argument .",
    "if @xmath5 scales with @xmath13 , then also its derivative with respect to @xmath13 does so .",
    "we have that @xmath127 and @xmath128 where @xmath129 denotes the probability that @xmath5 changes and @xmath130 measures the typical change in @xmath5 per such an aggregation event .",

    "thus @xmath135 and by making the ansatz @xmath136 ( since @xmath137 is cut - off by @xmath131 , @xmath138 ) , we obtain that @xmath139 exactly as one should if the growth is algebraic .    in the case of @xmath6 , the probability @xmath140 does not have to be algebraic .",
    "this is simply so because ( see fig .",
    "[ exampleclusters ] ) the roughness of the lower part of a cluster growing via sedimentation will also play a role : many of the smaller clusters will be `` swallowed '' inside the fjords opening downwards .",
    "it seems feasible that this leads to a change in the compactness of aggregates , which in turn results in a non - algebraic relationship between @xmath6 and @xmath13 .",
    "this is in fact a `` restructuring '' process , related to the changing compactness of aggregates .",
    "note the analogy with single cluster growth in various ballistic growth models ( with shadowing , see ch .",
    "5.7.2 of @xcite ) . there",
    "it is known that the bulk of the cluster becomes compact ( @xmath141 ) , and that the boundary of the cluster undergoes interesting roughening behavior . in our case",
    ", @xmath123 does not show signs of such a cross - over ( to compact geometry ) though @xmath142 might do so asymptotically .",
    "the equivalence to cluster growth is by no means clear in our case since the `` deposited '' clusters are sampled from the @xmath2 at each @xmath14 , the distribution of which is broad ( fig .",
    "[ nsigure ] demonstrates an example , see also ref .",
    "these clusters have a typical width - to - height ratio depending on @xmath13 , making the `` deposition problem '' much more complicated than such ones usually are",
    ". this will remain true for any @xmath14 , as the @xmath2 remains non - trivial .",
    "the implication is that for any finite peclet number there should be a slow cross - over process that depends self - consistently on the @xmath2 and on the cluster structure that has been formed through sampling smaller clusters from the same . in any case",
    ", the fact follows that the cluster structure is anisotropic : the more recently aggregated parts of clusters are not scale - invariant with the parts that have been created earlier in the aggregation process .     for @xmath114 , at @xmath143 .",
    "]    consider next the local exponents .",
    "for typical cluster sizes the local exponents of @xmath144 and @xmath145 seem to be close to the same value ( see figs .",
    "[ radii_max_min_etc_pe1 ] ( b ) and [ radii_max_min_etc_pe10 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "also the slopes of @xmath146 and @xmath147 behave similarly for large cluster sizes .",
    "this indicates that the cluster are elongated in the field direction , i.e. , @xmath148 .",
    "the elongation is more pronounced for high peclet numbers .",
    "the same conclusion is obtained by directly considering the angular distribution using the eigenvector corresponding to the larger eigenvalue  ( see section  [ shape_sec ] ) .",
    "although in the size region studied @xmath148 , the local slope of @xmath110 is larger than that of @xmath112 indicating that clusters grow faster in the direction perpendicular to the field .",
    "this implies that very large clusters should become elongated perpendicular to the sedimentation direction .",
    "rough estimates for the crossover values are @xmath149 , 80000 , and 300000 for @xmath106 , 1 , and 10 , respectively , and the corresponding radii of gyration 80 , 200 and 500 .",
    "these values are , unfortunately , larger than we are able to simulate but should be achievable in experiments , see for example  @xcite .",
    "the most important conclusion , is however a choice between two asymptotic scenarios .",
    "the data implies that asymptotically @xmath145 will scale with the maximum radius .",
    "hence , should this be the case , there are two possiblities to begin with : either the maximum radius also starts to follow the @xmath145 , with its scaling exponent ( 0.61 above ) , or then the asymptotic scaling of both could become volume - like ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "next we consider how the cluster shape evolves with time . to have an easily comparable measure for clusters of different sizes , we consider the scaled half - width of a cluster as a function of its scaled height @xmath151 , where @xmath152 and @xmath153 are the maximum and minimum @xmath78-coordinates of any of the particles in the cluster . the half - width at height @xmath154 is defined as @xmath155 where @xmath156 and @xmath157 are the maximum and minimum @xmath77-coordinates of any of the particles at that height .",

    "the relative width of a cluster increases with size as can be seen from figure  [ widthfigure ] , in which the half - width is shown for two peclet numbers .",
    "note , that the relative width may well become larger than the height of a cluster .",
    "for @xmath162 the clusters are symmetric with respect to the point @xmath163 but for @xmath115 they are wider at the bottom .",
    "this is due to the fact that as large clusters sediment faster than small ones they gather mass at bottom side . in other words , the upper part of a cluster",
    "is shielded by its lower part . for large clusters",
    "this results in a triangular - like shape , a particularly nice example of which is shown in fig .",
    "[ exampleclusters ] .",
    "the sedimentation driven aggregates are sparse and have complicated scaling properties ( see figs .  [ radii_max_min_etc_pe1 ] and [ radii_max_min_etc_pe10 ] ) as the clusters formed in the diffusion - dominated regime are themselves fractals .",
    "it is an open question as to what is the best characteristics of this kind of anisotropic cluster shapes .",
    "one possibility would be to look at the lower and upper parts separately ( e.g. the widths thereof , after splitting the cluster at the center of mass ) .",
    "the orientation of sedimenting clusters is considered using the angle @xmath164 between the eigenvector corresponding to the larger eigenvalue and the unit vector in the direction of the external field .",
    "figure  [ angular_dist ] shows the angular distribution for two values of the peclet number .    to study the effect of cluster size on orientation the clusters are divided in five different size classes .",
    "there is no difference in orientation with respect to cluster size .",
    "the main point , however , is that the clusters are orientated such that they prefer to have the longer principal axis aligned with the field and that the orientation distribution depends on the peclet number .",
    "for example , for @xmath115 , there are practically no clusters with @xmath165 .",
    "this is not in contrast to the conclusion made using the half - width as there is an important difference between these two approaches , when one averages them over cluster sizes .",
    "the averaging of the principal radii gives information about the typical cluster shape whereas averaging cluster width takes into account the selection of a preferred direction .",

    "we have studied the structure of two - dimensional clusters , which aggregate at contact and whose motion is dominated by diffusion for small cluster sizes and by sedimentation for large ones .",
    "considering the eigenvalues of the radius of gyration matrix , we show that due to the sedimentation the aggregates grow slower in the direction of the sedimentation velocity than perpendicular to it . moreover ,",
    "only the cluster width scales with cluster size and hence the clusters are not self - affine either , at the very least within the size range currently accessible in simulations .",
    "we underline that the data implies a cross - over scale , at which the maximal cluster radius will begin to scale with the average cluster width , but no further conclusions can be drawn about this regime .",
    "interestingly , the scaling exponent characterizing the growth of the width is independent of the peclet number , which characterizes the strength of the influence of sedimentation on aggregation .",
    "it is the one that defines `` self - similarity '' in the growing aggregates , but only in a limited sense since it concerns only a one - dimensional characteristics of the clusters ( in contrast to e.g.  a fractal dimension ) .",
    "the width scaling argument presented leaves open _ what _ the value of the width exponent would be but hints about the reasons as to why scaling is obtained in this respect , only . here",
    "the clear conclusion is that since the peclet number has no influence on the value ( @xmath181 ) it appears to be a universal one , and as such should be measured experimentally .",
    "the value to be obtained from three - dimensional experiments would hence be independent of the viscosity of the suspending liquid but not necessarily take the same value as obtained here .",
    "recent experiments have shown that the radius of gyration can be used to distinguish between the dlca and sedimentation regimes , with a clear change in the rate of increase with time @xcite .",
    "however , the fractal dimension was shown to initially remain at the corresponding dlca value .",
    "we believe this underlines the fact that in such simulations as ours it is easier to concentrate on measures that characterize the behavior of the large aggregates , as for instance @xmath182 .",
    "let us next discuss the justification of the simulation rules with the asymmetric growth in mind .",
    "as far as the growth is dominated by diffusion , the aggregates will be self - similar and diffusion characterized through @xmath183 is reasonable . when sedimentation starts to dominate this no longer holds but then the precise characterization of diffusion is unimportant anyway .",
    "in retrospect the algebraic dependence of the sedimentation velocity on the cluster size is just a lucky choice , a posteriori justified by the fact that @xmath5 scales algebraically . on the other hand ,",
    "the relation @xmath184 is invalid .",
    "this raises the academic question that how does the value of the universal exponent @xmath123 depend on the values of @xmath20 and @xmath35 ?",
    "one may argue as follows . as the fractal dimension of dlca clusters is independent of @xmath20 , it probably does not change the scaling properties of sedimenting clusters either .",
    "however , @xmath35 may and probably will have an effect ; at least on the universality grounds there is no reason why the value of @xmath123 would not change with @xmath35 .",
    "it would of course be possible to attempt much more elaborate and time - consuming simulations , in which the hydrodynamic radius of each aggregate is computed self - consistently .",
    "the anisotropic growth is also seen when studying the average form of aggregates .",
    "larger clusters are always relatively wider than their smaller counterparts . for small peclet numbers the clusters are rather elliptic but they became wider at the `` bottom part '' due to a shielding effect for large peclet numbers .",
    "we also studied the orientation of clusters with respect to the direction of the sedimentation velocity .",
    "clusters are oriented such that their height is larger than the width , but eventually the situation should be the opposite as the cluster width grows faster than the height",
    ". the larger the peclet number the stronger the cluster orientation anisotropy .",
    "the inequality of the growth rates in different direction implies that the scaling properties of sedimenting clusters can not be studied using the radius of gyration , which implicitly assumes the clusters to scale similarly in different directions .",
    "as there exist data from experiments  @xcite and simulations  @xcite considering aggregation of sedimenting clusters , it would be worthwhile to check for the possibility of anisotropic growth in these cases , too .",
    "experiments or simulations with larger aggregates could also reveal if the height of sedimenting aggregates will eventually scale with their size .",
    "it would definitely be also of interest to make simulations in the three dimensional case , and if cluster restructuring or rotational diffusion is allowed .",
