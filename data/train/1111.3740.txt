    "the hallmark of graphene , a single layer of carbon atoms arranged on a honeycomb lattice , is its particular band structure with a linear dispersion of the low - energy carriers around the two inequivalent ( dirac ) points @xmath0 and @xmath1 at the corners of the first brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 valleys are distinguished by the valley ( isospin ) degree of freedom which is robust against perturbations ( unless a momentum on the scale of the graphene s reciprocal lattice vector is transferred ) @xcite , which makes it attractive for ( valleytronics ) applications @xcite .",
    "hence , it is highly desirable to explore whether transport properties are controllable via the valley degree of freedom .",
    "as well - established @xcite , the charge hall conductivity @xmath2 is governed by the berry phase , which for each dirac cone is finite ( @xmath3 for @xmath4 ) , but the sum is zero .",
    "the berry curvature mediated hall effect in graphene has been studied in the presence of a spin - orbit coupling @xcite , or for a substrate - induced gap @xcite , or in the proximity to a superconductor @xcite . for a monolayer graphene with a uniform interaction gap , e.g. as resulting from the interaction with a substrate , one finds @xcite a finite berry curvature and a finite charge hall conductivity @xmath5 in each of the dirac cones by the interaction gap @xcite .",
    "the total charge hall current vanishes however , for the berry curvature and the charge hall conductivity for the two dirac cones are equal with opposite signs . to circumvent this problem and obtain a net charge hall current the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite proposed the creation of a non - equilibrium population in the dirac cones , which is inherently hard to realize and sustain in a real device .",
    "an energy gap in the electronic structure is advantageous for graphene applications .",
    "e.g. , a zero gap in graphene prevents the graphene field - effect transistor ( gfet ) device from possessing a turn - off state @xcite . a substrate - induced gap is not restricted to the sic substrate but is also observed for the hexagonal boron nitride substrate @xcite . a further way to tune the energy gap is via the strain engineering , e.g. as brought about by strain super lattices or wrinkles @xcite .",
    "the strain can be viewed as a symmetry - adapted effective , pseudo magnetic field in the sublattice space for the two valleys @xcite .",
    "a uniaxial strain can be realized experimentally by bending a flexible substrate @xcite . and a biaxial strain in graphene can be created by shallow depressions @xcite .",
    "recently , a zero - field quantum hall effect in graphene was proposed via a designed strain profile @xcite .",
    "usually , strain effect is studied via a minimal coupling which is momentum independent @xcite . here",
    "we go beyond the minimal coupling and include terms that are linear in the momentum by using the theory of invariants @xcite .",
    "the reason is that these terms will change the topology of the dirac cones and which is manifested in real physical quantities , for example the hall conductivity .",
    "furthermore , the effect of strain is usually thought to introduce time - reversal - invariant terms in the hamiltonian",
    ". however , we show in a time - reversal - breaking environment , for example under a weak magnetic field , the strain could couple with graphene via a time - reversal - breaking term which gives rise to exotic effects , e.g. , under the strain , a net charge hall current can be driven by an applied electric field .",
    "this effect may be useful to design strained - graphene - based devices where the hall current can be turned on and off via an in - plane weak magnetic field .",
    "for a general analysis , let us start from a hamiltonian derived by the theory of invariants that accounts systematically for all possible strains @xcite .",
    "symmetry operations and their compatibility with the underlying lattice structures are encapsulated in this approach .",
    "the general structure of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) dirac hamiltonian is @xmath6 the vectors @xmath7 and @xmath8 map the 2d momentum space to a 3d parameter space . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are structureless parameters in the sublattice space and yield no contributions to the berry curvature and hall effect ( see the appendix for details ) .",
    "the concrete form of these vectors depends on the realized physical situations and is given and discussed in full details in the appendix .",

    "[ d1d2](a ) .",
    "the @xmath11 and @xmath13 are related by a reflection @xmath43 ( a reflection through @xmath44 plane which is perpendicular to the graphene layer see @xcite ) .",

    "the role of @xmath43 in the _ d _ vector space is manifested as a reflection through @xmath51 plane . therefore , we have @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 between the phases of @xmath11 and @xmath55 .",
    "thus , with increasing @xmath47 in @xmath0 cone ( @xmath11 ) , the reflected vector in @xmath1 cone ( @xmath55 ) varies in the opposite direction which explains the cancelation of the total charge hall current ( see fig .",
    "[ d1d2](a ) ) .",
    "the above analysis is also valid in the presence of an interaction gap although a @xmath56 is introduced and a nontrivial topology in each dirac cone is induced by it .",
    "the interaction gap does not break the symmetry between the two dirac cones @xcite .      to discuss the effect of the strain ,",
    "let us first define the strain tensor as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a polar vector indicating the displacements of atoms . in the theory of invariants @xcite ,",
    "the strain tensor couples with @xmath48 giving rise to the irreducible tensors @xmath59 under @xmath60 group .",
    "we only focus on the @xmath61 which is derived by a multiplication of the irreducible matrices and the irreducible tensors that belong both to the @xmath62 representations .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian is expressed in terms of @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding irreducible matrices for these representations are @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "hence , we infer @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 where @xmath73 indicates irreducible tensors that transform according to the @xmath74-th irreducible representations of @xmath60 @xcite .    from the theory of invariants @xcite ( cf . also the appendix ) , we obtain the @xmath11 vector in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 cones without including the external electric field @xmath75 where @xmath26 denotes the valley degree , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 being a dimensionless parameter . as in studies on semiconductors all the parameters ( @xmath80 s )",

    "the effective vector potential whose components are @xmath81 and @xmath82 was studied as a minimal coupling in a strain - induced transport @xcite .",
    "this vector potential can also be expressed in terms of the hopping parameters in a tight - binding formalism @xmath83 and @xmath84 where @xmath85 s are the hopping parameters under strain @xcite .",
    "this term is independent of @xmath48 and can not change the topology of the dirac cones .",
    "please note the third component , i.e. @xmath86 , is present under the time - reversal - breaking environment .",
    "this term violates the @xmath11 vector from @xmath87 plane .",
    "thus the @xmath11 vector now describes a map from a 2d momentum space to a 3d vector space .",
    "we will study the specific consequences of this mapping .",
    "furthermore , the diagonal strain @xmath88 and the off - diagonal component @xmath89 yield new effects , beyond the minimal coupling , and give rise to extra terms that depend on @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the topology of the cones is changed and a non - vanishing hall conductivity will be the first - order effect from these terms .    note , that the @xmath90 term in the above equations stems from the contribution of a smooth rippling of the graphene sheet @xcite and results in an isotropic renormalization of the electron velocity .",
    "the action of the operator @xmath43 is now @xmath91 , @xmath92 . because of these symmetry relations , in the presence of a strain",
    ", a circle in the momentum space is mapped onto ellipses in the _ d _ vector space , as visualized in fig . [",
    "d1d2](b ) .",
    "the two ellipses are reflection - symmetric at @xmath93 plane in the _ d _ vector space . this plane is perpendicular to the one in the case of zero strain .",
    "this is the consequence of the symmetry property for the strain tensor @xmath94 under @xmath95 .",
    "@xmath94 is not a polar vector ( say @xmath48 ) and transforms like the symmetrized @xmath96 .",
