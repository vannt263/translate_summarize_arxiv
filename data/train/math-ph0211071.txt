    "when topological invariants of tilings were first defined and computed @xcite they arose as @xmath0-groups of associated @xmath1-algebras but it became soon clear that , apart from the order on @xmath2 , the @xmath0-groups are isomorphic to the integer valued ech - cohomology of the continuous hull of the tiling , or equivalently , to the integer valued cohomology of the discrete tiling groupoid @xcite . neither the continuous hull nor the discrete groupoid of a tiling are mathematical objects which are easily accessible by the non - expert .",
    "the purpose of this note is to present a formulation of ( real valued ) tiling or point pattern cohomology which we believe is easier to understand on an intuitive level , because it involves more standard mathematical objects .",
    "this does not mean that it is easier to compute the tiling cohomology in this formulation .",
    "but we hope that it helps understanding what the cohomology of a tiling actually means .",
    "we formulate our results below for delone sets of finite local complexity which we call for short here point patterns .",
    "this covers then the case of tilings of finite local complexity since the topological invariants mentionned depend only on mld - classes and tilings are mutually locally derivable from delone sets",
    ".    we will proceed along the following lines : let @xmath3 be a tiling or a point pattern in the euclidean space @xmath4 .",
    "we construct the ( real valued ) cohomology of @xmath3 as the cohomology of the sub - complex of the de - rham complex over @xmath4 given by the @xmath3-equivariant forms .",
    "the main new ingredient is thus the notion of @xmath3-equivariance .",
    "in a frequently used approach to describe particle motion in aperiodic media one investigates a hamiltonian of the form @xmath5 on @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the laplacian ( or even the magnetic laplacian in the presence of an external magnetic field ) and @xmath8 is a potential which describes the local interaction between the particle and the medium .",
    "this potential incorporates the aperiodic structure of the material in such a way that @xmath9 depends only on the local configuration one finds around @xmath10 .",
    "so if @xmath3 is a point pattern or a tiling representing the aperiodic structure ( e.g.@xmath3 is the set of equilibrium positions of the atoms in the material ) then @xmath8 should be a @xmath3-equivariant function in the following sense .",
    "recall that a discrete point set has finite local complexity if up to translation there are only finitely many @xmath11-patches for any @xmath11 , an @xmath11-patch being @xmath12 , the intersection of an @xmath11-ball at some point @xmath13 with @xmath3 .",
    "this implies that @xmath3 is uniformly discrete , i.e.  that any two distinct points have distance larger than a given @xmath14 .",
    "a delone set is a uniformly discrete point set for which relatively dense , i.e.  there exists an @xmath15 such all @xmath16-patches contain at least one point .",
    "[ def1 ] let @xmath3 be a subset of @xmath4 of finite local complexity .",
    "we call a function @xmath17 into some set @xmath18 strongly @xmath3-equivariant if there exists an @xmath14 such that @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is the closed @xmath11-ball around @xmath21 ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath22 is locally derivable from @xmath3 in the sense of @xcite .",
    "this means that for all @xmath14 exists @xmath15 such that @xmath23 implies @xmath24 .",
    "it is immediate from this definition that then any strongly @xmath22-equivariant function is also strongly @xmath3-equivariant .",
    "in particular the concept of @xmath3-equivariance is defined not only for a single point set but for mld classes of point sets .",
    "recall that the de - rham complex over @xmath4 is the complex @xmath25 where @xmath26 are the differential @xmath27-forms over @xmath4 and @xmath28 is the exterior derivative .",
    "using standard coordinates on @xmath4 a differential @xmath27-form can be written as @xmath29 with smooth functions @xmath30 . setting @xmath31 we may therefore consider strongly @xmath3-equivariant differential forms over @xmath4 as those for which the functions @xmath32 are smooth and strongly @xmath3-equivariant .",
    "we denote them by @xmath33 .",
    "clearly @xmath34 and so @xmath35 is a differential sub - complex of the de - rham complex .",
    "the @xmath3-equivariant de rham cohomology of @xmath4 is the cohomology of the sub - complex defined by @xmath33 .",
    "we denote it by @xmath36 , i.e.   @xmath37    the following theorem connects the above definition with the cohomology of @xmath3 as defined as ech cohomology of the continuous hull of @xmath3 .",
    "its proof will be given elsewhere @xcite although we give some explanation in section  [ sect4 ] .",
    "[ thm1 ] let @xmath38 be a delone set of finite local complexity .",
    "the real valued ech cohomology of the continuous hull of @xmath3 is isomorphic to the @xmath3-equivariant de rham cohomology of @xmath4 .",
    "let us present some examples of @xmath3-equivariant cohomology classes for @xmath39 , a penrose tiling , which may for our purposes be identified with the point set given by the centers of mass of its tiles . in the triangle version @xmath40",
    "has @xmath41 different translational congruence classes of tiles which are the decorated triangles of figure  7 and their images under @xmath42-fold rotation . together with a reflection , e.g.  the reflection in the @xmath10-axis , the @xmath42-fold rotations form symmetry group which is the dihedral group @xmath43 .",
    "we call the translational congruence classes of tiles prototiles and denote by @xmath44 the triangle corresponding the one in figure  7.k rotated about @xmath45 left around",
    ".    since the tiling is two - dimensional @xmath46 is non - trivial only in @xmath47 .",
    "the case @xmath48 is simple , in fact for any point pattern in any dimension holds @xmath49 .",
    "a closed strongly @xmath40-equivariant @xmath51-form is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a smooth strongly @xmath40-equivariant function .",
    "such functions can be constructed as follows : take a prototile @xmath54 and let @xmath55 be its center of mass .",
    "let @xmath56 be the dirac comb associated with @xmath54 by which we mean the sum of @xmath57-functions at points @xmath58 such that @xmath59 occurs at @xmath60 .",
    "in other words @xmath56 is a dirac comb supported on the center of masses of all tiles which are translationally congruent to prototile @xmath54 .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath61 be a smooth function of compact support .",
    "then the convolution product @xmath62 is a smooth strongly @xmath40-equivariant function .",
    "in fact , any smooth strongly @xmath40-equivariant function can be approximated in such a way if one allows for dirac combs which are supported on arbitrary points sets which are locally derivable from @xmath40 .",
    "the difficult part is to determine when two @xmath51-forms differ by a strongly @xmath40-equivariant exact form .",
    "it follows from the poincar lemma for compactly supported de rham cohomology that different choices of @xmath63 yield the same cohomology class as long as the average hight @xmath64 is kept fixed .",
    "we will therefore define @xmath65 remaining ambigious about the precise form of @xmath63 .    to go further we have to combine theorem  [ thm1 ] with known results . recall that the penrose tiling is a substitution tiling and that its substitution can be used to compute its second cohomology as a quotient of the cohomology of the af - groupoid @xmath66 defined by the substitution in @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the so - called substitution matrix defines an endomorphism @xmath67 and one finds the integer second cohomology of the penrose tiling as a quotient @xmath68 .",
    "the real second cohomology of the penrose tiling , which we denote here by @xmath69 , can therefore be identified with a complement of the real span @xmath70 of the sub - group @xmath71 in @xmath72 .",
    "such a complement has been computed @xcite @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 denotes the eigenspace of @xmath76 ( extended to a linear map on @xmath72 ) corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath77 .",
    "we can use this to present specific strongly @xmath40-equivariant @xmath51-forms which form a linear base for @xmath78 . in order to do",
    "so we first note that we can identify the standard base @xmath79 of @xmath80 with indicator functions on certain cylinder sets of the discrete hull .",
    "these cylinder sets are in one - to - one correspondence with the prototiles and theorem  [ thm1 ] allows us to identify the class of @xmath81 in @xmath82 with the cohomology class of the two - form @xmath83 .",
    "all we have to do is therefore to determine a base for the above complement and this is best done by a symmetry analysis similar to that given in @xcite .    in terms of the @xmath42-fold rotation matrix",
    "@xmath84 the substitution matrix @xmath76 is given by @xmath85 the eigenspaces @xmath86 are one dimensional and spanned by @xmath87 where @xmath88 , an eigenvector of @xmath84 to eigenvalue @xmath89 .",
    "both eigenvectors are invariant under the @xmath43-symmetry .",
    "the spaces @xmath90 are @xmath91-dimensional .",
    "each decomposes into a @xmath89-dimensional and a @xmath51-dimensional real irreducible representation of @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath89-dimensional irreducible real @xmath43-module is spanned by @xmath92 where @xmath93 is an eigenvector of @xmath84 to eigenvalue @xmath94 . using the matrix @xmath95 which implements the reflection in the @xmath10-axis ( see @xcite )",
    "one sees that the above two vectors are both invariant under it .",
    "the remaining @xmath51-dimensional parts of @xmath90 are easiest described if we complexify these spaces to observe that each splits into two @xmath89-dimensional complex irreducible @xmath43-modules , one spanned by @xmath96 and the other by the complex conjugate @xmath97 .",
    "here @xmath98 , an eigenvector of @xmath84 to eigenvalue @xmath99 and the reflection @xmath95 acts as @xmath100 .",
    "we illustrate this result in figure  2 by marking the coefficients of @xmath101 and @xmath97 into a figure of all prototiles using their identification with the base of @xmath102 .",
    "figure 2 : the coefficients of the four complex eigenvectors of ( [ eq3 ] ) and its complex conjugate .",
    "the four possibilities are @xmath103 .    from this analysis one can derive a set of generators for @xmath78 . from linear combinations of ( [ eq1 ] ) ( resp .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) ) one obtains @xmath104 ( resp .",
    "@xmath105 ) where @xmath106 the remaining @xmath107 generators are more complicated expressions but straightforward to derive from ( [ eq3 ] ) . in particular , to obtain two @xmath51-dimensional real irreducible representations of @xmath43 one has to take the real and the imaginary part of ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "we mention that this method allows also to determine a sub - group of finite index of the integer valued second cohomology .",
    "this amounts to taking linear combinations of the above vectors so that the result lies in the intersection of the above complement with @xmath80 . in that case one",
    "obtains integer irreducible representations of @xmath43 which are @xmath51 , @xmath51 and @xmath107 dimensional , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a closed strongly @xmath40-equivariant @xmath89-form is given by @xmath109 where @xmath110 are smooth strongly @xmath40-equivariant functions satisfying @xmath111 .",
    "a similar construction as the one presented for @xmath50 , namely one where one starts with a compactly supported closed @xmath89-form and places it at all points of a uniformly discrete set which is locally derived from @xmath40 , produces only exact forms .",
    "this follows again from the poincar lemma .    to construct closed but non - exact @xmath89-forms we use the well - known ammann lines on the penrose tilings .",
    "ammann lines are five families of parallel lines which are locally derivable from a penrose tiling @xcite .",
    "the distance between two consecutive parallel ammann lines of one family is @xmath89 or @xmath112 ( in suitable units ) and the sequence of distances forms a fibonacci sequence ( called musical sequence in @xcite ) .",
    "fix one family @xmath113 of ammann lines and let @xmath114 be orthonormal coordinates of @xmath115 such that @xmath116 is parallel and @xmath10 normal to the ammann lines of @xmath113 .",
    "in particular , a line @xmath117 normal to the ammann lines of @xmath113 is parametrized by @xmath10 and cut into a fibonacci sequence by its intersection points with these ammann lines .",
    "let @xmath118 be the set of intersection points in @xmath119 and @xmath120 be a smooth strongly @xmath118-equivariant function .",
    "then @xmath121 is a closed strongly @xmath40-equivariant @xmath89-form over @xmath115 . in the same way as we reasoned for the case @xmath50 above one can construct two strongly @xmath118-equivariant functions each one associated with a prototile in @xmath117 , namely by placing a dirac comb on the centers of mass of either the unit intervals or the intervals of length @xmath112 . in the cohomology",
    "@xmath122 corresponding to the @xmath89-dimensional subsystem these two functions lead to two independent generators . considering all families of ammann lines",
    "this gives @xmath42 strongly @xmath40-equivariant @xmath89-forms .",
    "however , one may show that in @xmath123 only @xmath107 of them are independent .",
    "in fact , the appearance of these @xmath89-forms is related to the higher dimensional lattice used to construct the penrose tiling via the cut & projection method and somewhat independent of the details of the tiling which originate from the choice of windows @xcite .    from @xcite we know ( in combination with theorem  [ thm1 ] ) that @xmath124 and the latter splits into a sum of a @xmath107-dimensional irreducible @xmath125 module with a @xmath89-dimensional irreducible @xmath125-module .",
    "the @xmath107-dimensional irreducible @xmath125 module is given by the above construction using the ammann lines .",
    "the remaining one is related to a locally derivable orientation of the edges of the penrose tiling @xcite , it will not be discussed here .",
    "for the definition of @xmath3-equivariant cohomology we have considered smooth real valued strongly @xmath3-equivariant functions over @xmath4 . to explain the relation with earlier definitions of cohomology groups for @xmath3 , in particular that involving the continuous hull , we now consider continuous complex valued functions .",
    "the algebra of complex continuous @xmath3-equivariant functions @xmath126 is the closure in the supremum norm of the space of complex continuous strongly @xmath3-equivariant functions over @xmath4 with pointwise multiplication .",
    "@xmath126 is a commutative @xmath1-algebra with unit and by the gelfand - naimark theorem there exists a compact space @xmath127 such that @xmath126 is isomorphic to @xmath128 .",

    "another simple example but with @xmath3 being a delone set is a regular lattice @xmath132 , then @xmath133 , i.e.@xmath134 , the @xmath28-torus . in general , @xmath127 is a lot more complicated .",
    "the set of subsets of @xmath4 which have finite local complexity  carries a metric @xmath135 the completion of the set of translates of @xmath3 w.r.t .",
    "this metric , @xmath136 is the continuous hull of @xmath3 , see e.g.  @xcite . by construction @xmath137",
