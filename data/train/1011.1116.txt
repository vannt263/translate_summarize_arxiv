    "lying at the heart of a broad spectrum of applications with different , if not opposite , demands , thermal management at the nanoscale is attracting a growing interest .    on the other hand , carbon based materials ( carbon nanotubes , graphene )  @xcite are of special importance due to their very high electronic mobilities and thermal conductivies.@xcite the extremely high thermal conductivity of two - dimensional clean graphene is not suited for energy applications .",
    "however , a further intentional damage ( with irradiation , isotope doping , ... ) or a reduction of the dimensionality ( graphene nanoribbons ) of the material can offer the way to tune phonon conduction while preserving good electronic conductance .",
    "an ideal situation would be to design a material with exceptional electrical conduction together with a thermally insulating state .",
    "this turns out to be extremely challenging , and would require to find a way to strongly localize phonon modes , somehow `` trapped '' in a random disorder potential . the existence of an anderson localization regime for acoustic phonons has been reported in some disordered materials  @xcite , but so far not in carbon - based materials .",
    "disordered carbon nanotubes ( cnt)-based bundles exhibit a tendency towards a weak thermal insulating regime  @xcite , whereas isotope disorder remains inefficient to strongly localize coherent phonons , even in presence of a large and complex underlying disorder profile.@xcite in contrast to carbon nanotubes , graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) offer additional sources of potential phonon scattering and localization because of the presence of irregular edges and enhanced chemical and structural reactivity that could affect low - energy phonon modes.@xcite other suggestions include the design of heterostructures made from cnts@xcite or pristine graphene mixed with disordered ( isotope impurities ) gnrs  @xcite , or selective functionalization of gnrs via grafted hydrogen impurities.@xcite    with these advances in nano - scale fabrication and thermal management , it becomes crucial to develop new computational techniques which are both able to account for the atomistic details of the systems and also can handle systems having sizes which are experimentally relevant . here ,",
    "an efficient linear scaling approach to compute coherent phonon propagation in structurally complex materials is described in detail .",
    "this approach is based on the kubo methodology and on the extensive use of the mkrt technique,@xcite which is a real - space ( order-@xmath2 ) computational framework .",

    ", we first extend our recent communication on the method  @xcite to a complete derivation of the phonon transmission coefficient starting from the original kubo formula and within the framework of the harmonic approximation .",
    "this means that only elastic scattering ( due for instance to isotope disorder ) will be introduced , disregarding anharmonic effects .",
    "the study of the dynamical properties of phonon wave - packets will also be related to the thermal conductance which requires a phonon frequency integration over the whole spectrum .",
    "we then validate the method by comparison with other numerical approaches or analytical results , and further apply this method to edge disordered gnrs and discuss its limits .",
    "the electronic transport theory in the linear response regime generally relies on the approach derived by r. kubo.@xcite to investigate bulk quantum phonon transport in disordered materials , the use of the kubo formalism turns out to be the most natural and computationally efficient one .",
    "it has already been used for investigating thermal transport in disordered binary alloys or nanocrystralline silicon.@xcite inspired by the mkrt scheme for electron transport,@xcite we derive a real - space implementation of the kubo formula for phonon propagation , which establish a direct computational bridge between phonon dynamics and the thermal conductance .",
    "in contrast to other implementations of the kubo approach , we extract the dynamical information from the time evolution of the wave - packet  @xcite ( based on the expansion of the evolution operator on a chebyshev polynomials basis ) and simulate quantum dynamics instead of solving the newtonian equations of motion.@xcite therefore , a single initial condition is enough , i.e. the initial atomic displacements , without any need to compute the time - dependent atomic velocities .",

    "<S> an efficient order@xmath0 real - space kubo approach is developed for the calculation of the thermal conductivity of complex disordered materials . </S>",
    "<S> the method , which is based on the chebyshev polynomial expansion of the time evolution operator and the lanczos tridiagonalization scheme , efficiently treats the propagation of phonon wave - packets in real - space and the phonon diffusion coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> the mean free paths and the thermal conductance can be determined from the diffusion coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> these quantities can be extracted simultaneously for all frequencies , which is another advantage in comparison with the green s function based approaches . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , multiple scattering phenomena can be followed through the time dependence of the diffusion coefficient deep into the diffusive regime , and the onset of weak or strong phonon localization could possibly be revealed at low temperatures for thermal insulators . </S>",
    "<S> the accuracy of our computational scheme is demonstrated by comparing the calculated phonon mean free paths in isotope - disordered carbon nanotubes with landauer simulations and analytical results . </S>",
    "<S> then , the upscalibility of the method is illustrated by exploring the phonon mean free paths and the thermal conductance features of edge disordered graphene nanoribbons having widths of @xmath120 nanometers and lengths as long as a micrometer , which are beyond the reach of other numerical techniques . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that , the phonon mean free paths of armchair nanoribbons are smaller than those of zigzag nanoribbons for the frequency range which dominate the thermal conductance at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> this computational strategy is applicable to higher dimensional systems , as well as to a wide range of materials . </S>"
