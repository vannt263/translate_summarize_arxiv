    "the compositions of planetary nebulae ( pne ) , the ejected envelopes of evolved low- and intermediate - mass stars ( m  =  18  m@xmath1 ) , are affected by past nucleosynthesis in their progenitor stars . in particular , these objects are important sources of c , n , and roughly half of the neutron(_n_)-capture element ( atomic number @xmath2 ) nuclei in the universe ( busso et al .  1999 , hereafter bgw99 ) .",

    "the seed nuclei undergo a series of _ n_-captures and @xmath8-decays that transform them into heavier elements ( kppeler et al .",
    "1989 ; bgw99 ; goriely & mowlavi 2000 ; lugaro et al .  2003 ; herwig 2005 ) .",
    "the intershell material , enriched in c ( from partial he burning ) and _ n_-capture elements , is conveyed to the stellar surface by convective mixing , a process denoted `` third dredge - up '' ( tdu ) to differentiate it from earlier dredge - up events during the red giant branch and early agb phases .",
    "tdu is believed to occur in stars with initial masses greater than 1.21.5  m@xmath1 , and is characterized by recurrent nuclear runaways of the he - burning shell ( i.e. , thermal pulses ) separated by periods of convective mixing and transport to the surface ( iben & renzini 1983 ; bgw99 ; herwig 2005 ; straniero et al .",
    "the enriched material is then released into the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) by stellar winds and ultimately pn ejection .",
    "abundance determinations in pne can be used to investigate the occurrence of the _ s_-process and tdu in pn progenitor stars , and their importance to the galactic chemical evolution of _ n_-capture elements .",
    "however , the low abundances of _ n_-capture elements ( @xmath9 relative to h ; asplund et al .",
    "2005 ) cause their emission lines to be weak , and these elements were not seriously considered to be detectable in pne until just over a decade ago .",
    "it was not until 1994 that _ n_-capture element lines were identified in the spectrum of a pn ( pquignot & baluteau 1994 , hereafter pb94 ) .",
    "these authors detected emission lines of kr ( @xmath10 ) , xe ( @xmath11 ) , and possibly other _",
    "n_-capture elements in a deep optical spectrum of the bright pn ngc  7027 . using approximations to the unknown kr and xe collision strengths ( which have since been calculated by schning 1997 and schning & butler 1998 ) and corrections for the abundances of unobserved ionization stages",
    ", these authors found that kr and xe are highly enriched in ngc  7027 , providing evidence for the occurrence of the _ s_-process and tdu in its progenitor star .",
    "the study of pb94 led dinerstein ( 2001 ) to realize that two long - unidentified emission lines seen in the @xmath12 band spectra of several pne are in fact fine - structure transitions of [ ] and [ ] .",
    "she found that the observed kr and se ( @xmath13 ) line strengths in ic  5117 and ngc  7027 are consistent with enhanced abundances , and furthermore proposed that the presence of these lines in some pne but not others indicates a spread in _",
    "s_-process enrichments among galactic pne .    until now",
    ", the only other studies of _ n_-capture element abundances in pne were those of sterling et al .",

    "( _ fuse _ ) .",
    "they derived ge abundances in five of the objects , and found it to be enhanced in four pne by factors of @xmath1510 , depending on the amount of ge depletion into dust .",
    "for one of these objects , swst  1 , sterling et al .",
    "( 2005 ) determined the line of sight fe abundance from the _ fuse _ spectrum , and found it to be only slightly depleted ( [ fe / s ]  =  @xmath16 ) .",
    "this implies that ge is also negligibly depleted in swst  1 , and that [ ge / s ]  =  @xmath17 , a factor of five enrichment relative to solar .    in all",
    ", these studies resulted in _ n_-capture element abundance determinations in only seven pne .",
    "such a small sample of objects divulges little information regarding the _ s_-process and dredge - up histories of pn progenitors as a population , or their role in the galactic chemical evolution of trans - iron species .",
    "therefore , we have undertaken a survey of galactic pne to search for the two near - infrared ( nir ) lines identified by dinerstein ( 2001 ) , [ ]  2.199 and [ ]  2.287  @xmath0 m .",
    "se and kr are useful tracers of _ s_-process enrichments and tdu in pn progenitor stars for two reasons : ( 1 ) neither is expected to be depleted into dust , as kr is a noble gas and se has not been found to be significantly depleted in the diffuse ism ( cardelli et al .",
    "1993 ) ; and ( 2 ) the detection of the nir lines of these elements in several pne ( e.g. , geballe et al .  1991",
    "; hora et al .  1999 ; lumsden et al .",
    "2001 ) indicates that they may be observable in a significant fraction of galactic pne .",

    "s_-process nucleosynthesis in agb stars ( e.g. , gallino et al .  1998",
    "; goriely & mowlavi 2000 ; busso et al .",
    "therefore , if a star experiences the _ s_-process and efficient tdu , se and kr will be enriched in the pn it produces .",
    "we have observed 103 pne in the @xmath12 band , and utilize literature data to expand our sample to 120 objects .",
    "this is the first large - scale survey of _",
    "n_-capture elements in pne , and comprises the first broad characterization of _ s_-process enrichments in pne as a population .",
    "we have detected se and/or kr in 81 of the 120 pne in our sample , which increases the number of pne with known _ n_-capture element abundances by more than a factor of ten .",
    "preliminary results from our survey have been presented in sterling & dinerstein ( 2003b ; 2004 ; 2005a , b ; 2006 ) and sterling ( 2006a ) .    in order to derive elemental se and kr abundances from our data ,",
    "it is necessary to correct for the abundances of unobserved ionization stages .",
    "we have added these elements to the photoionization codes cloudy ( ferland et al .  1998 ) and xstar ( kallman & bautista 2001 ; bautista & kallman 2001 ) , which we use to derive widely applicable formulae for calculating se and kr ionization correction factors ( icfs ) .",
    "this task is complicated by the general lack of atomic data governing the ionization balance of se and kr ( e.g. , photoionization cross - sections and rate coefficients for various recombination processes ) . in fact , these data are unknown for almost _ all _ _ n_-capture elements .",
    "therefore , we have used several approximations to calculate the atomic data of se and kr .",
    "we have modeled ten pne in our sample , which were selected because they exhibit emission lines from multiple kr ions in their optical and nir spectra .",
    "this enables us to adjust the uncertain kr atomic data until the observed line intensities of the various kr ions are satisfactorily reproduced by our models .",
    "unfortunately , no other se ions have been detected in pne , and thus we are unable to empirically correct the uncertain se atomic data . with the adjusted kr atomic data",
    ", we have run a grid of cloudy models spanning a wide range of physical parameters ( central star temperature , nebular density , and ionization parameter ) .",
    "we extracted the fractional abundances of se and kr ions from this grid , and searched for correlations between these and the ionic fractions of more abundant elements .",
    "the best correlations have been fit with analytical functions , which can be used to compute se and kr icfs .",
    "this paper , the first of two , describes these model calculations and presents the best analytical fits to the se and kr icfs . in the second paper of this series ( sterling & dinerstein 2007 , hereafter paper ii )",
    ", we will use our model - derived icfs to determine se and kr abundances for our full sample of objects .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in  2 , we briefly describe our observations and supporting data from the literature for the 10 objects we model in detail . in  3 , we present our models of these objects , empirically adjust the uncertain kr atomic data , and discuss how uncertainties in the adopted atomic data affect the derived abundances . in  4 , we present the grid of cloudy models from which we derive formulae to correct for unobserved ionization stages of se and kr . we discuss our results and provide concluding remarks in  5 .",
    "two appendices are also included .",
    "since the optical and nir lines of se and kr have been frequently misidentified in the literature , in appendix  a we investigate alternative identifications to the lines we consider in this study .",
    "in particular , we remove important contaminants to the se and kr lines , and systematically rule out other possible identifications . in appendix  b , we describe the se and kr atomic data we have adopted in our photoionization models .",
    "we have observed 103 pne in the @xmath12 band with the coolspec spectrometer ( lester et al .",
    "2000 ) on the 2.7-m harlan j.  smith telescope at mcdonald observatory .",
    "in addition , we utilize @xmath12 band pn spectra from the literature to expand our sample to 120 objects . in paper  ii we will fully describe the observational data and reductions , and here we present only a brief synopsis .",
    "each pn was observed from 2.142.30  @xmath0 m with a @xmath18 slit and 75  l / mm grating , at a resolution of @xmath19500 ( fwhm  =  0.004  @xmath0 m at 2.20  @xmath0 m ) .",
    "all data were reduced using iraf .",
    "for each two - dimensional spectrum , we performed dark subtraction , cosmic ray removal , and flat - fielding before extracting the one - dimensional spectrum .",
    "the 1d spectra were then wavelength calibrated and dispersion - corrected using ar lamp spectra . for each pn , we observed at least one a0 standard star at a similar airmass , which we used to response - correct the spectrum , remove telluric features , and perform flux calibrations .

    "@xmath0 m are resolved from nearby features of other species , except in pne exhibiting vibrationally - excited molecular hydrogen . in these objects ,",
    "the kr and se lines may be contaminated by h@xmath20  3 - 2  @xmath21(3 )  2.201 and h@xmath20  3 - 2  @xmath21(2 )  2.287  @xmath0 m , respectively . as shown in appendix  a.4 ,",
    "these lines are not important contaminants to the [ ] and [ ] fluxes of the ten pne considered in this paper .",
    "we have selected 10 pne from our sample that exhibit emission from [ ] ( and in one case , [ ] ) in their optical spectra , in addition to optical or nir [ ] emission lines .",
    "the additional observed ionization stages reduce the uncertainties in correcting for unseen kr ions , and enable us to empirically adjust the approximate kr atomic data with the aid of photoionization models .",
    "unfortunately , no other se ions have been clearly identified in pne , and hence we are unable to optimize the se atomic data .",
    "( a possible exception is [ ]  @xmath228854.2 , identified by pb94 in ngc  7027 .",
    "however , this line was undetected in the higher quality spectrum of zhang et al .",
    "2005 , and hence we consider pb94 s identification doubtful . )    the optical data references for these ten pne are given in table  1 , along with the spectral resolution , extinction coefficients , and the sources of the nir data and ( when applicable ) other useful information , such as elemental abundances and uv and ir line intensities .",
    "the nir line fluxes were dereddened using the extinction coefficients ( table  1 ) and adopted extinction law of the optical references .",
    "we then applied an aperture correction to the nir data ( to account for the different slit widths and positions of the optical and nir measurements ) by forcing the br@xmath23/h@xmath8 intensity ratios into agreement with the theoretical ratio at the @xmath24 and @xmath25 determined from the optical data , using table  b.9 of dopita & sutherland ( 2003 ) .",
    "the optical kr line intensities are given in table  2 , where the cited 1-@xmath26 errors are the flux uncertainties indicated in the optical data references .",
    "table  2 also lists the dereddened and aperture - corrected nir se and kr line intensities of these objects .",
    "the intensities have been corrected for contaminating blends as described in appendix  a.",
    "in order to derive se and kr abundances that are as accurate as possible , we have used two independent photoionization codes , cloudy ( ferland et al .",
    "1998 ) and xstar ( kallman & bautista 2001 ; bautista & kallman 2001 ) , to model the ionization structure of se and kr .",
    "we have expanded the atomic database for each of these codes to include se and kr , and performed detailed spectral fits of the ten pne listed in table  1 .",
    "the se and kr atomic data that we have utilized in cloudy and xstar are discussed in appendix  b. much of the atomic data controlling the ionization balance of these elements is unknown , in particular the photoionization ( pi ) cross - sections and rate coefficients for radiative recombination ( rr ) , dielectronic recombination ( dr ) , and charge transfer ( ct ) . as explained in appendix  b , we have used various approximations to calculate values for the cross - sections and rate coefficients of these atomic processes .    the atomic data has been entered into cloudy version c06.01 and xstar version 2.1kn3 .",
    "cloudy loops through all elements up to the maximum atomic number in its database , and therefore it was necessary to enter atomic data for the remaining elements between zn ( the heaviest element in vc06.01 ) and kr .",
    "we computed pi cross - sections and rr rate coefficients for ga , ge , as , and br using the same methods described in appendix  b , but assumed the ct , dr , and collisional ionization rate coefficients to be the same as the corresponding charge states of se or kr .",
    "these four elements were turned off in all of our cloudy models , and therefore do not affect our results .",
    "in contrast , it was not necessary to enter data for these intervening elements in xstar .",
    "se and kr are trace elements in pne , even when enriched by the _ s_-process . as such",
    ", they are not expected to significantly affect the thermal or ionization structure and predicted spectra of nebulae . for each of the models described in this section , we also ran the corresponding unaltered versions of cloudy and xstar ( without se and kr ) with the same input parameters to test this assumption . in all cases , we found negligible differences between the models with and without se and kr , indicating that our additions to the atomic databases did not introduce any unforeseen effects in the functionality of these codes .    in the following , we present detailed models of ten pne in which the input parameters were optimized to best",
    "reproduce the observed uv , optical , and ir spectra .",
    "we discuss uncertainties in the derived se and kr abundances in these nebulae arising from a variety of sources , including the atomic data , and how these will affect the derived abundances of our full sample of 120 pne .",
    "we performed detailed spectral fits to the uv , optical , and ir line intensities of the ten pne in table  1 , in order to reproduce their ionization structure .",
    "the main objective of this exercise was to compare the predicted kr line strengths to the observed ones , and to make necessary adjustments to the uncertain kr atomic data ( appendix  b ) so that these lines are best reproduced by our models .",
    "once agreement was achieved , we incorporated the optimized kr atomic data into our grid of cloudy models (  4 ) , which we use to derive icfs for se and kr .",
    "we made a number of simplifying assumptions in these models .",
    "first , spherical geometry was assumed , with filling and covering factors ( the fraction of material in a solid angle of 4@xmath27 steradians around the central star ) of unity .",
    "second , we assumed the nebulae have constant densities .",
    "since this produced reasonably good fits to the observed spectra , we did not attempt to use other density laws .",
    "finally , we do not include dust physics in our models of single objects , aside from the depletion of refractory elements into grains .",
    "this is likely to result in an inaccurate treatment of the thermal balance of the nebulae , due to the influence of photoelectric heating by dust ( dopita & sutherland 2000 ) .",
    "for this reason , the exclusion of dust may also affect the derived central star temperatures . in  4 ,",
    "we show that ignoring dust physics has a negligible effect on the predicted ionization balance of se and kr .",
    "these simplifications are not likely to be important for the purposes of our study .",
    "our goal is not to produce physically accurate models of these pne , but rather to establish the ionization balance of the nebulae in order to adjust the approximate kr atomic data .",
    "for this reason , our model - derived abundances for elements other than se and kr should not be regarded as improvements over those of the references listed in table  1 .    for the input parameters of each model",
    ", we initially adopted the abundances and densities reported in the literature ( see table  1 ) .",
    "it is also necessary to specify the stellar flux distribution , inner and outer radii of the nebular material , and ionizing luminosity of the central star .    in all cases , we utilized nlte stellar atmospheres including metal line blanketing , computed for hot compact stars such as the central stars of pne ( rauch 2003 ) .",
    "solar abundances were assumed for the model atmospheres , since the modeled pne are all galactic disk objects likely to have near - solar abundances .",
    "since the rauch ( 2003 ) grid only extends from 50,000  k to 190,000  k , we were unable to use it to model ic  418 , which has a very cool central star .",
    "t.  rauch ( 2005 , private communication ) kindly computed models with @xmath28 and 40,000  k and log(@xmath29 )  =  3.4 , which we use to model ic  418 .",
    "the rauch stellar atmospheres do not include mass - loss , which can significantly alter the ionizing flux of a pn central star ( kudritzki & pols 2000 ) .",
    "we have tested the dependence of our results on this factor by modeling ic  418 with a stellar atmosphere including mass - loss ( koesterke et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) , and find that incorporating mass - loss does not significantly affect the derived nebular abundances (  3.1.1 ) .    for the nebular radii and stellar luminosities",

    "one of the most important sources of uncertainty in our derived se and kr abundances is the approximate atomic data we have adopted . in order to gain insight into the magnitude of the abundance uncertainties introduced by the use of the approximate atomic data , we have run monte carlo simulations for four of our cloudy models , in which the threshold pi cross - sections and rate coefficients of rr , ct , and low-@xmath45 dr have been varied separately .",
    "the monte carlo simulations were run by using a gaussian random number generator included in the cloudy distribution .",
    "as described in appendix  b , we have used the kramers ( 1923 ) formula to derive threshold pi cross - sections for se and kr ions .",
    "gould ( 1978 ) showed that this approximation is accurate to within a factor of two for first and second row elements of the periodic table .",
    "since se and kr are significantly more complex systems , the kramers formula may not be as accurate .",
    "therefore , we have varied the se and kr pi cross - sections in cloudy by allowing each threshold cross - section to randomly take values within a gaussian distribution of fwhm 0.5  dex ( a factor of three uncertainty , 1-@xmath26 ) around the value given in table  b2 .",
    "we did not attempt to investigate deviations from the adopted _ shape _ of the cross - section as a function of energy ( a power law of index @xmath46 ) , and this remains an important uncertainty .",
    "we varied the rate coefficients for ct , low-@xmath45 dr , and rr by the same amount .",
    "while the rr rate coefficients were derived in a self - consistent manner using the milne relation and the pi cross - sections , the ct and low-@xmath45 dr rate coefficients could not be estimated from first principles .",
    "instead , we assumed that se and kr ions have the same rate coefficients for these processes as similar charge states of nearby elements .",
    "the 0.5  dex 1-@xmath26 uncertainties we adopt for the ct and low-@xmath45 dr rate coefficients are based on the expected uncertainties of landau - zener ct calculations ( kingdon & ferland 1996 ) and the error bars of the low-@xmath45 dr rate coefficient estimates in cloudy ( ferland et al .",
    "1998 ) , but may underestimate the actual uncertainties for se and kr ions .",
    "we chose four pne to illustrate the errors from atomic data uncertainties : ic  418 , ngc  6741 , ngc  6884 , and ngc  7027 .",
    "these objects were selected because they span a large range of nebular density and excitation . for each of these pne we ran 100 cloudy models , in which the pi cross - sections and rate coefficients for rr , ct , and low-@xmath45 dr were separately varied for all se and kr ions .",
    "the atomic data of each ion was varied independently of other ions .    in table  9 , we display the results of our monte carlo simulations , showing the errors ( in dex ) of predicted line intensities for each observed ion .",
    "the intensity errors reflect uncertainties in the abundance of the parent ion , which in turn affects the derived elemental abundances .",
    "it can be seen that errors in the pi cross - sections cause the greatest uncertainties in the predicted line intensities , followed by the ct , low-@xmath45 dr , and rr rate coefficients .",
    "taken together , the atomic data uncertainties alone can result in errors of nearly a factor of two ( 0.3  dex ) in the derived se abundances . in the case of kr , if only [ ] is observed ( as for most objects in our full sample )",
    ", the abundance errors can be as large as 0.26  dex from the atomic data uncertainties .",
    "however , since we have empirically adjusted the kr atomic data , the abundances are not likely to be so sensitive to atomic data uncertainties .",
    "this exercise reveals the sensitivity of our analysis to the unknown se and kr atomic data . without a dedicated effort to calculate and experimentally measure these atomic data , uncertainties in the ionization balance for",
    "se and kr will not allow their abundances to be derived to accuracies of better than 0.20.3  dex .",
    "in fact , when other sources of error ( e.g. , observational uncertainties ) are taken into account , their abundances may be considerably more uncertain .      in order to test the efficacy of the se and kr ionization balance and abundance results of our cloudy models",
    ", we have modeled the ten objects listed in table  1 with the photoionization code xstar ( kallman & bautista 2001 ; bautista & kallman 2001 ) .",
    "this code provides an independent test of our cloudy results .",
    "xstar is a 1d photoionization code , like cloudy , but does not incorporate dust physics .",
    "therefore , we used the same model assumptions ( spherical geometry , constant density , no dust ) as for the cloudy models . since xstar models are significantly more computationally demanding than cloudy , we did not attempt to fit the observed spectra by optimizing the input parameters . instead , we used the best - fit cloudy values as input parameters to these models , although it occasionally was necessary to adjust the outer radii slightly so that the models were not too optically thick or thin .",
    "we find that the xstar models reproduce the predicted cloudy spectrum for each pn reasonably well in all cases , with the intensities agreeing to within 30% for most lines .",
    "in particular , the [ ]  2.287  @xmath0 m line intensities agree with the cloudy results to within 30% , and often better , for all of the modeled pne . the predicted",
    "kr line intensities show larger differences from the cloudy results , sometimes by as much as 50% .",
    "however , no systematic trends were apparent for the models with discrepant kr line strengths .",
    "we therefore conclude that the se and kr abundance errors introduced by using different photoionization codes ( @xmath473050% ) are less than those of other sources of uncertainty ( line intensities , @xmath32 , densities , and atomic data errors ) .",
    "our ionization balance and abundance results for se and kr thus are not strongly model - dependent .",
    "the primary goal of this study is to derive widely applicable recipes to correct for the abundances of unobserved ionization stages of se and kr , so that their elemental abundances may be determined . for the vast majority of the pne in our full sample ( 120 objects ) ,",
    "we have observed only one ionization stage of each of these elements : se@xmath36 and kr@xmath35 .",
    "therefore , we have constructed a grid of cloudy models spanning a large range of physical parameter space , to search for correlations between the fractional abundances of se@xmath36 and kr@xmath35 and ionic fractions of more commonly detected elements . in particular , the grid includes models for various values of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and ionization parameter @xmath48(h)@xmath49 , where @xmath50(h ) is the hydrogen - ionizing photon density , @xmath51 the inner radius of the nebula , and @xmath52 the speed of light .",
    "given the density , the ionization parameter essentially determines the ionizing luminosity of the central star .",
    "we list in table  10 the full set of physical parameters which were varied in our grid of models .",
    "a model was run for every combination of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and log(@xmath53 ) in table  10 , for a total of 3761 models .    in our grid of models",
    "we have ignored dust , and assumed the default pn abundances in cloudy ( from aller & czyzak 1983 and khromov 1989 ) .",
    "we have tested the sensitivity of our results to metallicity and the presence of dust , which we discuss in the subsections below .",

    "the fractional abundances from each model in our grid are represented as dots . in some of the panels , e.g. , se@xmath36/se vs.  o@xmath35/o ,",
    "a family of curves is seen among the plotted ionic fractions .",
    "each curve corresponds to a single value of @xmath32 , indicating the correlation s sensitivity to the nebular gas temperature ( which generally increases with @xmath32 ) .",
    "we have performed fits to the ionic fraction correlations , using a @xmath44 minimization routine written in idl , and considering polynomial and exponential functional forms .",
    "these are displayed in figure  1 as solid lines .",
    "the inverses of these fitting functions correspond to icf formulae which can be used to convert se and kr ionic abundances into elemental abundances .    in particular , when [ ] is the only kr ion observed , the kr icf may be derived using the fractional abundance of either s@xmath35 or ar@xmath35 , which are commonly detected in optical spectra of pne .",
    "the icfs are : @xmath56 @xmath57 and @xmath58 @xmath59 the lower limits to @xmath60 and @xmath61 denote the range of validity for these icfs ( below these limits , the icfs become negative ) .",
    "of these two icfs , we recommend equation  ( 1 ) over equation  ( 2 ) since more ions of ar ( ar@xmath35 , ar@xmath36 , and ar@xmath62 ) are typically observed in optical spectra of pne than of s ( s@xmath43 and s@xmath35 ) .",
    "this leads to a more accurate ar abundance from optical data than that of s. in fact , henry et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have found that s abundances in pne may be inaccurate when determined from optical data and model - derived icfs , and explain this behavior by the inability of photoionization models to accurately compute the abundance of s@xmath36 , which can only be observed with ir spectroscopy .    nevertheless , both correlations ( top panels of figure  1 ) are quite strong , and if the ar and s abundances are well - determined , both should be reliable if our models accurately reproduce the kr ionization equilibrium . in paper",
    "ii , we make use of both of these equations .    on the other hand ,",
    "correlations between se@xmath36/se and ionic fractions of other elements are not as well - defined .",
    "this will lead to less accurate icfs , and hence less accurate se abundance determinations . in the middle left panel of figure  1",

    "although we do not utilize these icfs in our study , we present them for completeness .",
    "the icf that is least sensitive to variations in @xmath25 , @xmath32 , and @xmath53 is @xmath65 @xmath66 however , in order to detect [ ] , it is necessary to have obtained a spectrum extending to at least 7550   . for data which do not extend to such long wavelengths",

    "however , some of the pne of our sample may have substantially different abundances . in order to test the robustness of our icfs to the assumed metallicity",
    ", we have run the same grid of models for low metallicity pne by dividing the default cloudy pn abundances by 10 for all elements heavier than he , and using nlte stellar atmospheres with halo abundances ( rauch 2003 ) .",
    "note that these abundances were not chosen to represent specific pne , but are simply used to illustrate that our derived icfs are not strongly dependent on the adopted nebular abundances .    in figure  2",
    ", we show the se and kr ionic fraction correlations discussed above when low metallicity abundances are adopted .",
    "we overplot the fits to the correlations of figure  1 as solid lines . as can be seen from figure  2 , adopting lower metal abundances",
    "does not significantly affect the correlations we found in the previous section .",
    "in particular , the correlations described by equations  ( 1)(4 ) for high metallicities are remarkably similar to those at low metallicities ( although slightly less se@xmath36 is produced at high o@xmath35 fractions in the low metallicity models ) .",
    "the only significant discrepancies in the correlations are for those in the lower panels of figures  1 and 2 , where we find higher ( kr@xmath55  kr@xmath36 ) fractional abundances in our low metallicity models for low ( ar@xmath55  ar@xmath36)/ar and ( o@xmath72  o@xmath35)/o .",
    "this signifies a deterioration in the accuracy of equations  ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) for low metallicity , low excitation pne .",
    "however , these correlations exhibit a large dispersion even at higher metallicities , and are not as reliable as the correlation of equation  ( 4 ) , which applies to low metallicity pne .",
    "we conclude that adopting a lower metallicity does not significantly affect the icfs of equations  ( 1)(4 ) .",
    "to test the dependence of our icfs on the inclusion of dust physics , we have run our grid of models with c - rich grains ( the `` grain orion graphite '' command in cloudy ) and o - rich dust ( the `` grain orion silicate '' command ) , with grain properties from baldwin et al .",

    "while some minor differences in the fractional abundances of these ions are apparent when compared to figure  1 , the icfs derived from models without dust ( overplotted as solid lines ) also apply to models that include dust .",
    "in our o - rich dust models , the silicate grains began sublimating for high values of log(@xmath53 ) ( @xmath73 ) , and hence we were not able to run our full grid .",
    "however , the correlation plots ( not shown ) are similar to those of the c - rich dust models , and again no significant differences are seen compared to the dust - free models .",

    "we compare the se and kr abundances determined from our icfs to those found from our models of the ten pne listed in table  1 (  3.1 ) .",
    "since our interest is primarily in determining se and kr abundances from their nir lines , we only consider the icfs given by equations ( 1)(3 ) .",
    "for each of the ten pne we have modeled , we have taken ionic and elemental abundances needed for our icfs ( ar@xmath35/ar , s@xmath35/s , and o@xmath35/o ) from the literature ( see table  1 ) . to properly account for uncertainties in the derived icfs",
    ", we consider errors in these ionic and elemental abundances .",
    "unfortunately , such an error analysis has not been performed in any of the abundance references we use .",
    "therefore , we adopt 20% uncertainties in the o , s , and ar ionic and elemental abundances ( see paper  ii ) .",
    "we propagate these errors into our icfs , as well as the standard deviations of our fits to the ionic fraction correlations in figure  1 .    to determine the kr@xmath35 and se@xmath36 ionic abundances , we have utilized 5-level and 2-level model atoms , respectively , with transition probabilities and effective collision strengths from the references listed in table  b1 . in these calculations ,",
    "we have used the @xmath24 ( [ ] ) and @xmath25 derived in the optical data references .",

    "we present the results of our calculations for kr in table  11 and se in table  12 . in these tables , the icfs derived from equations ( 1)(3 ) are given , followed by the abundances determined using our icfs and photoionization models . despite the considerable uncertainties we estimate for the icfs",
    ", we find gratifying agreement between the icf and model abundance determinations . in all cases ,",
    "the abundances agree within the errors , and with a couple of exceptions agree to within 0.15 dex ( @xmath3740% ) for kr and 0.1 dex ( @xmath3725% ) for se .",
    "this also illustrates that the simplifying assumptions we made in our models do not significantly affect the derived se and kr abundances .",
    "the largest discrepancies in the kr abundances occur for objects in which only  [ ]  @xmath226826.7 was detected , while 2.199  @xmath0 m was unobserved .",
    "as discussed in appendix  a.3 , @xmath226826.7 can be blended with  @xmath226827.9 and telluric oh emission in low resolution spectra .",
    "therefore , the intensity of [ ]  @xmath226826.7 may be quite uncertain if these contaminants are not properly removed .",
    "another major source of error in our icf - derived abundances stems from the icf itself . in some cases , the uncertainties in the icf approach a factor of two .",
    "furthermore , for small o@xmath35 or ar@xmath35 fractions , the icf becomes large , and may conceivably be more uncertain than we have estimated .",
    "we believe that the uncertainties in the icfs and [ ]  @xmath226826.7 intensities are able to explain the largest discrepancies between our icf- and model - derived se and kr abundances , namely for ngc  6741 , ngc  6826 , and ngc  7662 .",
    "nevertheless , the overall agreement between the se and kr abundances derived with these different methods is encouraging , and validates the icfs we have derived .",
    "we have presented results of a photoionization model study designed to derive correction factors for the abundances of unobserved se and kr ions .",
    "these corrections are needed to determine elemental abundances from our survey of [ ]  2.199 and [ ]  2.287  @xmath0 m in 120 galactic pne , the first large - scale survey of _",
    "n_-capture elements in pne .",
    "we have added se and kr to the atomic databases of the photoionization codes cloudy and xstar .",
    "while the atomic data concerning energy transitions for the observed se and kr ions are known ( i.e. , transition probabilities and effective collision strengths ) , much of the data governing the ionization equilibrium of these elements have not been determined .",
    "we have approximated the rate coefficients for these processes as outlined in appendix  b.    when deriving icfs , it is critical to accurately solve for the ionization balance of the element in question . to this end , we calculated detailed models of ten pne exhibiting emission lines from multiple ionization states of kr .",
    "the kr atomic data were then empirically adjusted until the emission line intensities from the various kr ions were adequately reproduced by our models . unfortunately",
    ", no other se ions have been clearly detected in pne , and thus we could not empirically correct the uncertain se atomic data we adopted .",
    "this makes the se abundances we derive from our survey inherently more uncertain than those of kr .    using the adjusted kr atomic data",
    ", we computed a grid of cloudy models spanning a large range of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and ionization parameter @xmath53 , which encompass the values of these parameters likely to be encountered in most pne . from these grids , we extracted the fractional abundances of the observed se and kr ions , and compared them to the ionic fractions of commonly detected elements .",
    "we computed fits to the best correlations we found , which serve as icfs that can be used to determine se and kr elemental abundances when only one or two ions of these species are observed .",
    "the icf formulae are given in equations  ( 1)(6 ) .",
    "we have compared the se and kr abundances derived with the icf method with those determined from our photoionization models of ten pne . in most cases , the abundances agree to within 2540% .",
    "the few discrepant abundances serve to illustrate the magnitude of errors in the icfs .",
    "when uncertainties in the ionic and elemental abundances used in the icfs are taken into account , the se and kr icfs are uncertain by at least 20% and 40% , respectively , and the errors may approach a factor of two in some cases . it should be noted that the ten pne we have considered are among the brightest and most well - studied pne in the northern hemisphere . for fainter objects in our nir survey , the icfs may be even more uncertain .",
    "therefore , when a realistic and rigorous error analysis is applied , our derived se and kr abundances are unlikely to be determined with an accuracy of better than 50% .",
    "a more serious factor in the accuracy of our se and kr abundance determinations is the uncertain atomic data governing the ionization equilibrium of these elements ( pi cross - sections and rate coefficients for rr , dr , and ct ) .",
    "we have run monte carlo simulations to test the importance of these uncertainties in our models of four pne , allowing the rate coefficients of these atomic processes to vary within a gaussian distribution of fwhm 0.5  dex around the adopted values , or a factor of three ( 1-@xmath26 ) uncertainty .",
    "in particular , uncertainties in the pi cross - sections are the most significant , and can lead to errors of up to 0.20.25  dex ( @xmath7480% ) in the predicted line intensities of [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] .",
    "uncertainties in the ct rate coefficients are the next most important , especially for the lower ionization states , and can result in errors of up to 0.15 dex ( 40% ) in the [ ] intensities .",
    "the rate coefficients for low-@xmath45  dr are also significant , and can lead to errors of 0.10.2 dex ( 2560% ) in the predicted intensities of high ionization se and kr lines , particularly for low excitation objects . the uncertainties in the predicted line intensities correspond to uncertainties in the abundances of the parent ions , which propagate into the elemental abundance errors . taken together",
    ", the atomic data uncertainties alone can result in se abundance errors of 0.3  dex ( a factor of two ) , and kr abundance uncertainties of up to 0.20.25  dex .",
