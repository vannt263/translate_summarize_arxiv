    "in order to compare the results of theoretical calculations with an astrophysical observation , it is necessary to convolve the theoretical calculations with a measure of the angular response of the detector and to calculate the quantities which correspond to those being observed .",
    "the angular response is often called the `` beam function '' .    in particular , knowledge of the beam profile and",
    "its spherical harmonic transformation is of critical importance for interpreting data from cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) experiments .",
    "a common simplifying assumption in the spherical data analysis is to take the experimental beam response to have a circular gaussian profile as in the flat - sky approximation @xcite .",
    "more recently , methods to perform the convolution of a cmb map with a general asymmetric beam , an elliptical gaussian beam profile have been also investigated @xcite .",
    "it is often required to convolve spherical data , such as all - sky survey maps , with a smoothing function .",
    "a circular gaussian beam function has been also used to take the angular position errors into account in the procedure of computing the angular power spectrum of bastse 3b gamma - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "smoothing of two - dimensional spherical data is also a procedure routinely used in many fields of sky survey data analysis @xcite .",
    "a gaussian function in flat - sky approximation is applicable only when the beam width @xmath2 .",
    "the spherical version of a gaussian function is known as a fisher - von mises function by mathematicians @xcite .",
    "1 shows substantial differences between a gaussian function and a fisher - von mises function when the beam width @xmath3 .",
    "thus , it is worth to investigate the convolution of spherical data with a fisher - von mises distribution function . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the spherical harmonic transformation of a fisher - von mises function , which is required for the convolution of a spherical data with a beam width @xmath3 .",
    "we found the exact solution , recursive relation , and generating function of the spherical harmonic coefficients .",

    "its spatial resolution is about @xmath4 due to the optical properties of the fims instrument and errors in attitude knowledge provide by spacecraft .",
    "the first far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) sky maps are in preparation to be published .",
    "analysis of the fuv sky survey data obtained with fims motivated the present work .",

    "a fisher - von mises function @xcite is defined by @xmath29 characterized by the _ concentration parameter _ @xmath30 .",
