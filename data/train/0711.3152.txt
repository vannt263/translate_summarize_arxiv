    "such channels have been investigated extensively in the wideband regime where the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is typically small , and it was shown that in the limit as the available bandwidth tends to infinity the capacity of the fading channel is the same as the capacity of the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel of equal received power , see @xcite .",
    "when the snr is large we encounter a different situation .",
    "indeed , it has been shown in @xcite for non - coherent _ frequency - flat _ fading channels that if the fading process is regular in the sense that the present fading can not be predicted perfectly from its past , then at high snr capacity only increases double - logarithmically in the snr .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the logarithmic growth of the awgn capacity .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for extensions to multi - antenna systems , and see @xcite and @xcite for extensions to non - regular fading , i.e. , when the present fading can be predicted perfectly from its past .",
    "thus , communicating over non - coherent flat - fading channels at high snr is power inefficient .    in this paper , we show that communicating over non - coherent _ multipath _ fading channels at high snr is not merely power inefficient , but even worse : if the delay spread is large in the sense that the variances of the path gains do not decay faster than geometrically , then capacity is _ bounded _ in the snr . for such channels , capacity does not tend to infinity as the snr tends to infinity . to state",
