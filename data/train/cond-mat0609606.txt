    "reducing the size of magnetic nanoparticles in view of room - temperature technological applications costs a high price .",
    "very small particles present two major difficulties : i ) they are less stable against thermal fluctuations , and ii ) they have an important contribution from the boundary which induces large deviations from the homogeneous ( collinear ) magnetic state . as an immediate consequence of the latter the magnetic state of the particle can not be represented by a macroscopic magnetic moment ( single - moment approach ) , and one has to resort to finer ( local ) approaches involving the atomic magnetic moment right from the beginning . only then can one distinguish , and thereby estimate the role of , the various environments inside of the particle , and in particular one may assess the effect of the boundary / surface contribution on the static as well as dynamic behaviour of the magnetic particle .",
    "this of course assumes that one has adequately adapted the computing methods .",
    "the magnetic structure and switching mechanisms of many - spin particles ( msp ) have been studied for a few years now by many authors using numerical methods , such as the solution of landau - lifshitz equation and monte carlo technique @xcite .",
    "analytical calculations using the modified spin - wave theory @xcite and the spherical model @xcite have shown that the spin disorder on the boundary is of long range and propagates deep into the particle .",
    "most of the results emphasize the important role of surface anisotropy and boundary effects and the necessity to take account of the internal structure of nanoparticles .",
    "however , the study of the dynamics of nanoparticles in the many - spin approach presents tremendous difficulties related with the analysis of the energyscape ( minima , maxima , and saddle points ) , which is a crucial step in the calculation of the relaxation rate and investigation of the magnetization reversal at finite temperature .",
    "one may then address the question as to whether there exist some cases in which the full - fledged theory that has been developed for the one - spin - particle ( osp ) approach [ see @xcite and references therein ] can still be used to describe an msp . in refs .",
    "we showed analytically and numerically that indeed , for small deviations from the collinear state , we can model the magnetic state and switching mechanisms of an msp by a macrospin in an effective potential energy containing a uniaxial and cubic anisotropy terms . in this paper , we will briefly review through some examples that results that show how the surface defects , and the spin non - collinearities they entail , fundamentally alter the magnetic properties of a small ( @xmath1 nm ) nanoparticle .",
    "in particular , we will show that such a nanoparticle behaves according to different regimes with crossovers determined by the underlying material parameters , notably the surface anisotropy ( model and intensity ) .",
    "it turns out that in some typical parameters ranges , namely weak surface anisotropy , the osp approach may be rehabilitated provided that an effective picture of the particle is adopted . more precisely , the msp may be represented by a single ( macroscopic ) magnetic moment with an effective energy .",
    "this simplification provides us with a useful tool for studying the dynamics , and the thermally activated switching of the magnetization , of a small nanoparticle while taking account , though in a phenomenological manner , the effect of its boundary .",
    "surface effects are due to the breaking of crystal - field symmetry at the boundary of the nanoparticle . in order to study such effects",

    "obviously , for very small surface anisotropy the cubic contribution becomes negligible [ see the first panel in fig .",
    "[ enscape2d_h0_varyks ] , @xmath86 ] and the osp sw model provides a good approximation to the msp .",
    "accordingly , some experimental macroscopic estimations of the surface anisotropy constant yield , e.g. , for cobalt @xmath100 @xcite , for iron @xmath101 @xcite , and for maghemite particles @xmath102 @xcite",
    ". however , one should not forget that this effective constant depends on the particle s size , among other parameters such as the material composition , and for , e.g. a diameter of @xmath103 nm we may expect stronger anisotropies .",
    "in the particular ( and typical ) situation , considered above , where the exchange interaction is much stronger than the anisotropy energy we find that the magnetization can be represented as the spatially homogeneous  global \" magnetization plus a small inhomogeneous contribution that we calculated analytically and numerically @xcite .",
    "the latter is induced by surface anisotropy and it is maximal near the surface but can extend deeply into the body of the particle .",
    "it describes the adjustment of the magnetization to the conditions at the surface by minimizing the total energy with fixed direction of the global magnetization . as a result",
    ", we obtain the effective particle s energy that depends on the orientation of its net magnetization and arises because of surface anisotropy .",
    "this contribution is of second order in the surface anisotropy and it adds to other terms , such as the bulk anisotropy and the first - order contribution from the surface anisotropy , which disappear in samples of cubic or spherical shape .",
    "these contributions to the energy of a magnetic nanoparticle are crucial to its dynamical behavior , in particular , in the ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) . accurately taking all of them into account",
    "should make it possible to determine the bulk and surface anisotropies from the experimental data .",
    "an interesting problem is the dynamical aspect of the magnetization adjustment mentioned above .",
    "if the anisotropies are much smaller than exchange interaction , the exchange - driven adjustment is much faster than the global precession of the magnetization induced by the anisotropy .",
    "then , these adjustment modes behave adiabatically at low frequencies and the effective osp energy is a good approximation . for materials with a very strong surface anisotropy such separation of dynamical scales is no longer valid , and the dynamics of such nanoparticles becomes an essentially many - body process .",
    "fmr experiments on magnetic nanoparticles should allow to estimate the values of the surface anisotropy and detect different regimes of their dynamical behavior .",
    "the effective osp energy ( [ uniaxialcubicenergy ] ) could be used in investigating the thermally activated reversal of a small nanoparticle .",
    "indeed , this effective energy , together with ( [ keff ] ) , allows us to include surface effects , though in an approximate way , while offering a considerable simplification over the initial many - spin system .",
    "however , one should note that the effective potential energy contains a quartic term in the net magnetization components , which renders the analysis of the energyscape somewhat more involved but still tractable @xcite , as opposed to the case of a many - spin particle . in ref .",
    "it was shown that for the case of mixed uniaxial and cubic anisotropies , there are two different relaxation rates , one for the parallel component of the magnetization and the other for the component perpendicular to the core uniaxial anisotropy axis . using eq .",
    "( [ keff ] ) one finds , for instance , that the parallel relaxation rate increases with increasing surface anisotropy while the perpendicular component has the opposite behaviour . this issue requires a more thorough investigation .",
    "nevertheless , for small enough surface anisotropy for which the effective energy ( [ uniaxialcubicenergy ] ) holds best , the minima are mainly defined by the uniaxial anisotropy .",
    "the effect of the cubic - anisotropy contribution is then to modify the loci of the saddle points and their number , and thereby the calculation of the relaxation rates becomes more involved @xcite .",
    "we have studied the properties of magnetic nanoparticles with the many - spin approach including the internal structure and physical parameters such as core and surface anisotropy and exchange interactions .",
    "we have shown that upon varying the surface anisotropy constant there appear three regimes [ see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ swnonsw ] ] : i ) when this constant is very small with respect to the exchange coupling all observables can be scaled recovered within the stoner - wohlfarth macroscopic approach .",
    "ii ) for small and intermediate values , the energy , and thereby the related quantities , of the many - spin particle can be modeled by an effective expression containing a surface - renormalized uniaxial contribution and a @xmath64-order contribution that is induced by the surface anisotropy .",
    "iii ) for large values of the surface anisotropy constant the spin non - collinearities are so strong that the magnetic state of a nanoparticle can no longer be represented by a net magnetization . in this case , the switching of the particle s magnetization proceeds cluster - wise . in the intermediate regime , we have also discussed the possibility of studying the effect of surface anisotropy on the relaxation rate and speculated how to determine the nature and intensity of the surface anisotropy using the technique of ferromagnetic resonance .",
    "however , the present models on which all calculations are based suffers from some deficiencies : for instance , it is assumed that the crystal structure on the surface is the same as in the core with the same atomic lattice parameters .",
    "this can not be wholly true considering the possibility of surface reconstructions .",
    "of course , these models do include apices , edges and facets , and the possibility of taking the exchange coupling on the surface as different from that in the core , or that between the core and the surface .",
    "however , there is no guarantee that it will become experimentally possible in the near future to estimate the atomic positions and lattice parameters and may be theoretically possible to perform crystal field calculations , and eventually check these assumptions .",
    "likewise , the magneto - crystalline anisotropy constant and exchange coupling in the core are taken as those in the bulk underlying material .",
    "however , we have shown that the core of a nanoparticle does not enjoy the properties of the underlying bulk material . for a given material",
    "such parameters could vary with the radius of the particle .",
    "in addition , the intensity and nature of surface anisotropy constitute a real challenge .",
    "there are many estimates but no firm understanding is achieved yet as to how surface anisotropy stems from the atomic structure in nanoparticles of reasonable size . for these interrogations to receive answers experimentalists will have to devise ever more sensitive equipments and measurement techniques in order to probe the intrinsic properties of nanomagnets and have direct access to the related physical observables .",
    "this , of course , will require new strategies for further isolating the nanomagnets and rid them off the influence of their hosting matrices and mutual interactions .",
    "on the other hand , understanding the influence on the particles static and dynamic behavior of the surrounding matrix and the inter - particle interactions , is of paramount importance to efficient practical applications .",
    "new experiments on adequately prepared particles are needed to check the validity of these results which , if confirmed , should help us better understand the dynamics of nanoparticles beyond the macrospin approximation ."
