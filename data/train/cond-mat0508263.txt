    "nonextensive statistical mechanics @xcite , originally developed as an equilibrium formalism , has indeed many interesting applications for driven nonequilibrium systems of sufficient complexity .",
    "consider e.g.  a brownian particle moving through a changing environment .",
    "we may assume that the environment is inhomogeneous and a suitable parameter describing the state of this environment , e.g.  the inverse temperature @xmath1 , fluctuates on a relatively large spatio - temporal scale .",
    "this means that there is a fast dynamics given by the velocity of the brownian particle and a slow one given by temperature changes of the environment .",
    "the two effects produce a superposition of two statistics , or in a short , a superstatistics @xcite .",
    "the stationary probability distributions for an ordinary brownian particle in a constant environment are certainly gaussian distributions , but for a fluctuating environment one obtains non - gaussian behaviour with fat tails .",
    "these tails can decay e.g. with a power law , or as a stretched exponential , or in an even more complicated way @xcite .",
    "which type of tails are produced depends on the probability distribution @xmath2 of the parameter @xmath1 . for the above simple example of a generalized brownian particle , @xmath1 is the fluctuating inverse temperature of the environment , but in general @xmath1 can also be an effective friction constant , a changing mass parameter , a changing amplitude of gaussian white noise , the fluctuating energy dissipation in turbulent flows , or simply a local variance parameter extracted from a signal .",
    "recent applications of the superstatistics concept include a variety of physical systems , such as lagrangian @xcite and eulerian turbulence @xcite , defect turbulence @xcite , atmospheric turbulence @xcite , cosmic ray statistics @xcite , solar flares @xcite , solar wind statistics @xcite , networks @xcite , random matrix theory @xcite , and mathematical finance @xcite .",
    "if @xmath1 is distributed according to a particular probability distribution , the @xmath3-distribution , then the corresponding marginal stationary velocity distributions of the brownian particle obtained by integrating over all @xmath1 are given by the generalized canonical distributions of nonextensive statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "for other distributions of the intensive parameter @xmath1 , one ends up with more general statistics , which contain tsallis statistics as a special case .    in this paper",
    "we first briefly review the superstatistics concept .",
    "we then look at typical occupation times of the superstatistical brownian particle in cells of constant temperature , distinguishing between temporal and spatial temperature fluctuations . in section 4",
    "we emphasize a certain analogy between the step from statistics to superstatistics and the step from 1st quantization to 2nd quantization : in both cases the rate equations for probability densities are upgraded from deterministic partial differential equations to stochastic ones .",
    "finally , in the last section we compare with experimental data in turbulent flows , where superstatistical models are a very useful tool to effectively describe the dynamics .",
    "it is well known that for equilibrium systems of ordinary statistical mechanics the probability to observe a state with energy @xmath4 is given by @xmath5 this formula just describes the ordinary canonical ensemble .",
    "@xmath6 is the boltzmann factor , @xmath7 is the density of states and @xmath8 is the normalization constant of @xmath9 . for superstatistical systems ,",
    "one generalizes this approach by assuming that @xmath1 is a random variable as well . indeed , a driven nonequilibrium system is often inhomogeneous and consist of many spatial cells with different values of @xmath1 in each cell .",
    "the cell size is effectively determined by the correlation length of the continuously varying @xmath1-field .",
    "if we assume that each cell reaches local equilibrium very fast , i.e.  the associated relaxation time is short , then in the long - term run the stationary probability distributions arise as a superposition of boltzmann factors @xmath6 weighted with the probability density @xmath2 to observe some value @xmath1 in a randomly chosen cell : @xmath10    the simplest example is a brownian particle of mass @xmath11 moving through a changing environment in @xmath0 dimensions . for its velocity @xmath12 one has the local langevin equation @xmath13 ( @xmath14 : @xmath0-dimensional gaussian white noise , @xmath15 : friction constant , @xmath16 : strength of noise ) which becomes superstatistical because for a fluctuating environment the parameter @xmath17 becomes a random variable as well : it varies from cell to cell on the large spatio - temporal scale @xmath18 . of course , for this example @xmath19 . during the time scale",
    "@xmath18 the local stationary distribution in each cell is gaussian , @xmath20 but the marginal distribution describing the long - time behavior of the particle for @xmath21 , @xmath22 exhibits fat tails .",
    "the large-@xmath23 tails of the distribution ( [ margi ] ) depend on the behaviour of @xmath24 for @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "many different superstatistical models corresponding to different @xmath2 are possible : the function @xmath26 is determined by the environmental dynamics of the nonequilibrium system under consideration .",
    "consider , for example , a simple case where there are @xmath27 independent gaussian random variables @xmath28 underlying the dynamics of @xmath1 in an additive way .",
    "@xmath1 needs to be positive and a positive @xmath1 is obtained by squaring these gaussian random variables .",
    "the probability distribution of a random variable that is the sum of squared gaussian random variables @xmath29 is well known in statistics : it is the @xmath3-distribution of degree @xmath27 , i.e. the probability density @xmath2 is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the average of @xmath1 .",
    "one can now simply do the integration in eq .",
    "( [ margi ] ) using eq .",
    "( [ chi2 ] ) @xcite .",
    "the result is the generalized canonical distribution of nonextensive statistical mechanics , i.e.  a @xmath32-exponential of the form @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 thus these types of generalized boltzmann factors occur as stationary states for nonequilibrium systems with suitable fluctuations of some intensive parameter @xmath1 .    instead of @xmath1 being a sum of many contributions , for other systems",
    "the random variable @xmath1 may be generated by multiplicative random processes . in this case one",
    "typically ends up with a log - normally distributed @xmath1 @xcite , i.e.   the probability density is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are parameters .",
    "both @xmath3-superstatistics ( @xmath39 tsallis statistics ) and lognormal superstatistics are relevant for turbulent systems .",
    "the observation is that the former one particularly well describes atmospheric turbulence data @xcite , whereas the latter one gives good results for laboratory turbulence ( e.g.  taylor - couette flow ) @xcite .",
    "note that the reynolds number is controlled for laboratory turbulence , whereas it fluctuates for the atmospheric case .",
    "let us now discuss some subtleties of the superstatistical modeling approach .",
    "an important question is what really causes the fluctuations of temperature around the brownian particle .",
    "clearly these are produced by the fact that we consider a driven nonequilibrium system in a stationary state which has some external energy input and also some energy dissipation ( like the sun acting on the earth s atmosphere and producing spatio - temporal temperature fluctuations in form of the weather ) .",
    "there are , however , different possibilities : either there could be explicit temporal temperature changes around the brownian particle , or the particle could move through spatial cells of size @xmath40 which all have different temperatures but no explicit time dependence .",
    "the latter case is more a spatial then a temporal effect , and corresponds to a frozen random pattern .    to treat the second case properly",
    ", we have to take into account the average occupation time of the brownian particle in a cell of size @xmath40 where the temperature is approximately constant .",
    "locally , in each cell the velocity of our particle is described by the ornstein - uhlenbeck process and its position by the ornstein - uhlenbeck position process @xcite .",
    "the latter process is a gaussian diffusion process .",
    "for each position component @xmath41 , @xmath42 of the brownian particle one has for large times @xmath43 @xmath44 where the diffusion constant @xmath45 is given by the einstein relation @xmath46 of course , the larger the temperature @xmath47 in a given cell , the faster the particle will diffuse , hence it will occupy a given cell of size @xmath40 for a shorter time on average if the temperature is higher in that cell .",
    "in fact , the average time @xmath48 the particle spends in a cell of temperature @xmath47 is given by @xmath49 assuming that on average all spatial cells with a given local temperature have the same typical size @xmath40 , this means the average occupation time @xmath48 in a given cell is proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "the probability to find the particle in a given cell is proportional to the occupation time , hence this means we have to adjust the probability density @xmath50 describing the spatial distribution of @xmath1 in the various cells by a factor @xmath1 if we proceed to a temporal description @xmath51 , i.e.  if we take into account how much time the particle spends in each cell : @xmath52 in general , one has for a given effective energy @xmath4 the local boltzmann - gibbs distributions @xmath53 in each cell ( assuming for simplicity a constant density of states ) .",
    "these distributions are properly normalized , @xmath54 taking temporal averages over all possible @xmath1 , one obtains the marginal distributions @xmath55 our previous consideration shows that proceeding to a spatial probability density @xmath56 describing the distribution of @xmath1 in the various spatial cells requires an additional weighting by a factor @xmath1 , since a typical particle will spend more time in cells with small temperature .",
    "we thus arrive at @xmath57 our consideration shows that care has to be taken in the interpretation of the probability density @xmath2 , namely whether it describes the distribution of @xmath1 in spatial cells or in temporal time slices . in general , one must also take into account the density of state and the fact that for brownian particles probability densities are usually regarded as a function of the velocity @xmath12 rather than the energy @xmath19 .",
    "this corresponds to a simple transformation of random variables .",
    "let us once again emphasize that for a superstatistical brownian particle one has a superposition of two stochastic processes on different time scales : a fast stochastic process given by a local ornstein - uhlenbeck process and a slow stochastic process given by @xmath58 .",
    "the @xmath1-process can a priori be anything .",
    "we assume that the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ lange ] ) are constant for a sufficiently long time scale @xmath18 , and then change to new values , either by an explicit time dependence , or by a change of the environment through which the brownian particle moves .    for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider the 1-dimensional case .",
    "locally , in a given cell with constant temperature the probability density @xmath59 obeys the fokker - planck equation @xcite @xmath60 with the local stationary solution @xmath61 in the superstatistical approach , one regards @xmath62 and @xmath63 as stochastic processes as well , which evolve on a much larger typical time scale @xmath18 as compared to @xmath64 .",
    "this means that for superstatistical systems the above equation is not an ordinary fokker - planck equation : it is a fokker - planck equation whose coefficients @xmath62 and @xmath63 are stochastic processes , with all their properties to be specified by a characteristic functional .",
    "hence , in the superstatistical approach the equation that determines the evolution of probabilities becomes a stochastic partial differential equation  rather than a deterministic one . at the end",
    ", one has to perform an average over all realizations of @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "needless to say that one can generalize all this to superstatistical versions of higher - dimensional and nonlinear fokker - planck equations as well .",
    "we can see a certain analogy to the process of second quantization in quantum field theories .",
    "consider , for example , a klein - gordon ( or schrdinger ) field . the klein - gordon ( or schrdinger ) equation governs the time evolution of a wave function , and the wave function squared essentially gives the quantum mechanical probability density in a first - quantized system .",
    "thus the klein - gordon ( or schrdinger ) equation corresponds to a deterministic evolution equation for probability densities . in our case , this role is taken over by the local ( deterministic ) fokker - planck equation . in order to proceed to second quantization in quantum mechanics",
    "a possible method is to add noise to the classical field equation ( e.g. the klein - gordon equation ) , obtaining a second - quantized theory via the stochastic quantization procedure @xcite . by second quantization",
    ", we thus construct a stochastic partial differential equation , a klein - gordon equation with noise . in a similar way",
    ", for superstatistical systems we proceed from a deterministic fokker - planck equation to a stochastic one , by replacing the constant parameters @xmath15 or @xmath16 by suitable stochastic processes . thus proceeding to a superstatistical description",
    "is analogous to proceeding to a second quantized description in quantum mechanics .    to completely solve the superstatistical system dynamics one has to find all solutions of the stochastic fokker - planck equation ( which are stochastic processes ) and then form expectations . in full generality",
    ", this is quite a heavy task , though some progress has been made for very simple dichotomous models @xcite .",
    "the solution of the stochastic fokker - planck equation depends on what type of stochastic processes are chosen for @xmath62 and @xmath63 . as shown in @xcite , one has for example a power - law decay of the marginal velocity correlation function if @xmath15 fluctuates and @xmath16 is constant , and an exponential decay if @xmath15 is constant and @xmath16 fluctuates , choosing the same @xmath3-distribution of @xmath65 in both cases and assuming @xmath66 , @xmath67 being the local relaxation time in each cell . to construct the best superstatistical model for a given physical application",
    ", one has to carefully compare with the experimental data , looking at both , stationary densities and correlation functions .",
    "a major application of superstatistics is in turbulence modeling @xcite . here essentially the local velocity @xmath68 of the superstatistical brownian particle model corresponds to a local longitudinal velocity difference @xmath69 in the turbulent flow , and @xmath1 is a local variance parameter connected with fluctuations in energy dissipation . as said before , to construct a suitable superstatistical turbulence model one has to compare carefully with various experimentally accessible quantities . for the example of a measured velocity time series in a turbulent taylor - couette flow , one basically observes the following @xcite : the probability density @xmath51 is essentially a lognormal distribution ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "correlation functions of the measured velocity signal @xmath64 decay more or less exponentially , but those of temporal velocity differences @xmath70 on a a given time scale @xmath71 decay asymptotically with a power law ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the marginal distribution @xmath72 exhibits fat tails whose flatness decreases with increasing @xmath71 . on all scales the measured histograms @xmath72 are well described by lognormal superstatistics as given by eq .",
    "( [ margi ] ) and ( [ logno ] ) , replacing @xmath73 .",
    "one observes a    a clear time - scale separation between the process @xmath74 and the corresponding process @xmath58 : @xmath58 evolves on a much larger typical time scale .",
    "this time scale separation increases with increasing reynolds number , as well as with @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "the process @xmath58 is strongly correlated , its correlation function decays with a power law .      c. tsallis , j. stat .",
