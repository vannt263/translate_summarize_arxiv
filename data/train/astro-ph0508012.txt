    "with the assumption that globular clusters trace the general shape and extent of the milky way ( mw ) , shapley ( 1918 ) first showed how they can be used to estimate the distance ( @xmath0 ) to the galactic center ( gc ) , expected to lie at the center of the cluster distribution .",
    "though shapley s first execution of this experiment exaggerated @xmath0 due to cluster distance scale problems , the overall scheme of mapping an extended distribution of galactic tracer objects to determine the location of its center remains a valid , if traditionally underutilized , strategy .",
    "the globular cluster sample is relatively small and concentrated to the gc , where dust effects introduce large distance uncertainties and a likely still incomplete and lop - sided cluster census .",
    "population ii tracers like rr lyrae , blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) or giant stars are much more plentiful outside of the mw bulge .",
    "unfortunately , the current census for these tracers is even more incomplete than for globulars .",
    "though this situation may be remedied by currently planned wide angle surveys , several inherent problems remain with exploitation of these tracers as gc benchmarks . as with the clusters ,",
    "the mw zone of avoidance ( za ) will always result in biased sample distributions and potential @xmath0 underestimates  exacerbated if surveys do not reach the far side of the mw .",
    "even more challenging is that the global distributions of halo stars are far from dynamically mixed : recent surveys of the above tracers reveal a halo streaked with substructure , likely originating as satellite disruption debris ( e.g. , vivas et al .",
    "2001 , newberg et al .",
    "2002 , majewski 2004 ) and eroding simple halo axisymmetry .",
    "the very existence of numerous tidal streams motivates the present contribution . _",
    "individual _ tidal streams actually possess a relatively simple spatial configuration . within spherical potentials ,",
    "tidal debris arms from a disrupting satellite will lie along the satellite orbital plane , which contains the gc .",
    "a sufficiently extended tidal debris arc defines that plane , which intersects the mw @xmath1 axis at the gc .",
    "this simpler , almost two - dimensional geometry of tidal stream arcs removes the need for sample completeness : in principle , @xmath0 should be derivable from the @xmath4distance ) distribution of only a large enough sample of tidal stream stars to define their orbital plane .    in reality ,",
    "non - spherical potentials precess tidal streams .",
    "fortunately , this is a relatively small effect in the mw , at least for @xmath5 s of tens of kiloparsecs .",
    "johnston et al .",
    "( 2005 ;  j05 \" ) showed the sagittarius ( sgr ) tidal stream precession is sufficiently small to conclude the mw potential is only slightly oblate within the sgr orbit ( peri : apo - galacticon of 13:57 kpc ) .",
    "moreover , as pointed out also by helmi ( 2004 ) , that part of the sgr trailing arm arcing across the southern mw hemisphere ( see majewski et al .",
    "2003 , `` mswo '' ) is so dynamically young that it hasnt had _ time _ to precess ( see fig .  5 of j05 ) .",
    "unfortunately , as noted by mswo , sgr is in almost the worst possible orientation to undertake the proposed @xmath0-gauging : with a virtually negligible angle between the sgr orbital plane and @xmath1 axis , small errors in the definition of the orbital plane ( due to small residual precession , and the finite width of the debris plane ) lead to substantial uncertainties in derivation of @xmath0 .    the ideal tidal debris configuration for estimating @xmath0 has a _ pole _ closer to the @xmath1 axis .",
    "given the pace of discovery , such a stream may soon be found .",
    "based on the nearly polar orientation of the hi magellanic stream and the typically measured proper motions ( @xmath6 s ) for the magellanic clouds ( gardiner & noguchi 1996 , van der marel et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) , it is clear that a stellar counterpart to the magellanic stream would have almost the perfect orientation for gauging @xmath0 .",
    "systematic errors in a tracer distance scale translate to estimates of @xmath0 .",
    "however , because streams contain different stellar types ( e.g. , giant stars , rr lyrae , bhb ) , uncertainties from photometric / spectroscopic parallaxes can be cross - checked . in most cases , reddening and crowding effects",
    "can be of negligible concern .",
    "alternatively , with nasa s space interferometry mission ( sim ) , direct _ trigonometric _ parallaxes will be well within reach : for a putative magellanic stellar stream orbiting at @xmath7 kpc radius , the @xmath8 - 20 @xmath6as parallaxes are well above the sim wide - angle astrometric accuracy goal of 4@xmath6as , assuming k giant star tracers ( @xmath9 ) .    as a test of what might be achieved , we ran n - body simulations of different mass satellites disrupting for 5 or 10 gyr ( whatever was needed to produce @xmath10-long tails ) in the galactic potential that best fitted the sgr debris stream in law et al .",
    "( 2005 ;  l05 \" hereafter ) .",
    "the orbit was constrained to match the current position , radial velocity ( rv ) and @xmath6 ( gardiner & noguchi 1996 ) of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , with orbital pole @xmath11 .",
    "all other model parameters were similar to those in l05 .",
    "each simulation was  observed \" outside a @xmath12 za , with @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 tracer stars ( apportioned with @xmath16 of these in the satellite core and @xmath17 in the tidal tails ) , and with 0 , 10 and 20% random gaussian distance errors imposed .",
    "the simplest ( though not best ! ) analysis of these data is simply to fit a plane and measure its intersection with the @xmath1 axis . with this 0th - order method , even for large samples of stars in dynamically cold streams ( i.e. , not that from a 10@xmath18 m@xmath19 progenitor ) and no distance errors , relatively large ( @xmath20 ) systematic errors in @xmath0 can remain ( fig",
    ".  1 ) because plane - fitting does not account for the residual precessional twisting of the debris arms .",
    "the direction of precession ( determined by the direction of the stream angular momentum vector ) drives the sense of the imposed systemic @xmath0 error ( i.e. closer or farther ) , and random distance errors add additional uncertainties depending on details of the stream orientation relative to the za .",
    "a better , now proven method ( e.g. l05 ) is to use n - body modeling to reconstruct a given stellar stream ; such modeling can precisely account not only for precession but also for stream dispersion and other higher order uncertainties , which would permit a more accurate identification of the center of the mw potential for an appropriately oriented stream .",
    "recent measurements of stellar motions around sgr a@xmath21 have led to dynamical parallaxes good to 5% ( @xmath22 kpc ; eisenhauer et al .",
    "2003 ) , a measurement sure to improve with longer sgr a@xmath21 field monitoring campaigns .",
    "few percent quality trigonometric parallaxes of stars near the gc will be measured as part of a sim key project . in either method ,",
    "the target stars are reasonably expected to lie at the assumed center of the mw potential .",
    "the proposed use of tidal streams to measure @xmath0 will provide an interesting test of this hypothesis , since tidal streams orbit the _ true _ dynamical center of the _ integrated _ potential over tens of kiloparsec scales .",
    "a comparison of this center to the sgr a@xmath21 distance could reveal whether the mw may be a lop - sided spiral ( e.g. , baldwin et al .",
    "1980 , richter & sancisi 1994 , rix & zaritsky 1995 ) .",
    "such lop - sidedness can , in fact , be induced by mergers of large satellites ( walker , mihos & hernquist 1997 ) . in principle",
    ", three well - measured tidal streams can verify whether the gc lies along @xmath23 , since the true gc should lie at a mutual intersection of the three corresponding stream orbital planes .",
    "despite decades of effort , the local mw rotation rate remains poorly known , with measurements varying by 25% .",
    "s @xcite suggest that the local standard of rest ( lsr ) velocity is @xmath24 km s@xmath25  i.e. near the iau adopted value of 220 km s@xmath25 .",
    "but a more recent measurement of @xmath6 for sgr a@xmath21 ( reid & brunthaler 2004 ) yields a higher @xmath26 km s@xmath25 , whereas direct hst measurements of the @xmath6 s of bulge stars against background galaxies in the same field yield @xmath27 km s@xmath25 ( kalirai et al .",
    "2004 ) and @xmath28 km s@xmath25 ( bedin et al . 2003 ) .",
    "of course , these measures ( as well as any of those depending on the oort constants ) rely on an accurate measure of @xmath29 (  1 ) . the solar peculiar motion must also be known , but is a smaller correction ( e.g. , @xmath30 km s@xmath25 ; dehnen & binney 1998 ) . on the other hand , considerations of non - axisymmetry of the disk yield corrections to the measurements that suggest @xmath3 may be as low as @xmath31 km s@xmath25 @xcite or lower ( kuijken & tremaine 1994 ) . independent methods to ascertain @xmath3 are of great value because it is fundamental to establishing the mw mass scale .    eventually , as part of a key project of sim , @xmath3 will be measured directly by the absolute @xmath6 of stars near the gc . here",
    "we describe an independent method for ascertaining @xmath3 using halo tidal streams that overcomes several difficulties with working in the highly dust - obscured , crowded gc , and one also insensitive to @xmath29 ( for all reasonable values of the latter ) .",
    "the ideal tidal stream for this method is one with an orbital pole lying near the @xmath2 axis .",
    "the sgr tidal stellar stream not only fulfills this requirement , but its stars , particularly its trailing arm m giants , are ideally placed for uncrowded field astrometry at high mw latitudes , and at relatively bright magnitudes for , and requiring only the most modest precisions from , sim .",
    "indeed , as we show , this method is even within the grasp of future high quality , ground - based astrometric studies .",
    "it is remarkable that the sun presently lies within a kiloparsec of the sgr debris plane ( mswo ) .",
    "the pole of the plane , @xmath32 , means that the line of nodes of its intersection with the mw plane is almost coincident with the @xmath1 axis .",
    "thus ( fig .",
    "2 ) the motions of sgr stars _ within _ this plane are almost entirely contained in their galactic @xmath33 and @xmath34 velocity components , whereas the @xmath35 motions of stars in the sgr tidal tails almost entirely reflect _ solar motion_. to the degree that its @xmath35 distribution is not completely flat in figure 2 is due to the slight amount of streaming motion projected onto the @xmath35 motions from the 2@xmath36 sgr orbital plane tilt from @xmath1 , compounded by ( 1 ) keplerian variations in the space velocity of stars as a function of orbital phase , as well as ( 2 ) precessional effects that lead to @xmath37-variable departures of sgr debris from the nominal best fit plane to all of the debris .",
    "the latter is negligible for trailing debris but is much larger for the leading debris , which is on average closer to the gc and dynamically older compared to the trailing debris when viewed near the galactic poles ( j05 ) .",
    "in addition , because the leading debris gets arbitrarily close to the sun ( l05 ) , projection effects make it more complicated to use for the present purposes . additional problems with the leading arm debris , which suggest that more complicated effects have perturbed it are discussed in l05 and j05 . in contrast , the sgr trailing tail is beautifully positioned fairly equidistantly from us for a substantial fraction of its stretch across the southern mw hemisphere ( mswo ) .",
    "this band of stars arcing almost directly `` beneath '' us within the @xmath1-@xmath38 plane provides a remarkable zero - point reference against which to make direct measurement of the solar motion _ almost completely independent of the sun s distance from the gc . _",
    "the extensive mapping ( mswo ) of the sgr tails with two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) m giants provides an ideal source list for individual stellar targets from this @xmath39-wrapped , mw polar ring .",
    "l05 used m giant spatial ( mswo ) and rv data ( majewski et al .",
    "2004 ) to constrain models of sgr disruption , best fitting when a 3.5 @xmath40 m@xmath19 sgr of 328 km s@xmath25 space velocity orbits with period 0.85 gyr and apo : peri - galactica of 57:13 kpc .",
    "these models fit what appears to be @xmath412.5 orbits ( 2.0 gyr ) of sgr mass loss in m giants .",
    "the adopted mw potential is smooth , static and given by the sum of a disk , spheroid and halo described by the axisymmetric function @xmath42 ^ 2+d^{2})$ ] where @xmath43 is the halo flattening , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are cylindrical coordinates and @xmath46 is a softening parameter .",
    "additional model details are given in l05 .",
    "model fits to the sgr spatial and velocity data allow predictions of the 6-d phase space configuration of sgr debris .",
    "figure 2 shows predicted @xmath47 velocity components of debris as a function of longitude , @xmath37 , in the sgr orbital plane ( see mswo ) . the debris is shown assuming @xmath48 , @xmath49 kpc , and a characterization of the total potential whereby the lsr speed is @xmath3 = 220 km s@xmath25 .",
    "l05 explores how variations in @xmath43 affect primarily the @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( through projection along rv ) .",
    "figure 3 ( green , yellow , and magenta points ) shows how variations in the _ scale _ of the potential , expressed through variations in adopted @xmath3 , affect @xmath35 .",
    "clearly , @xmath3 ranging from 180 to 260 km s@xmath25 translates to obvious variations in observed @xmath35 for trailing arm stars .",
    "this effect is easily separable from any residual uncertainty in the shape of the potential or @xmath0 : figure 3 ( red and blue points respectively ) illustrates negligible @xmath35 changes produced by holding @xmath3 fixed at 220 km s@xmath25 but varying @xmath43 from 0.9 to 1.25 ( i.e. oblate to prolate ) and @xmath29 from 7 to 9 kpc .",
    "figure 3 is the basis for the proposed use of sgr to measure @xmath3 . ideally , to execute the experiment requires obtaining @xmath35 from the observed @xmath6 and rvs of sgr arm stars . however , because of the particular configuration of sgr trailing arm debris , almost all of @xmath35 is reflected in the @xmath6 of these stars , and , more specifically , the reflex solar motion is contained almost entirely in the @xmath50 component of @xmath6 for sgr trailing arm stars away from the mw pole . working in the observational , @xmath6 regime means that vagaries in the derivation of _ individual _ star distances can be removed from the problem , as long as the system is modeled with a proper _ mean _ distance for the sgr stream as a function of @xmath37 .",
    "figure 4 shows three general regimes of the trailing arm @xmath50 trend : ( 1 ) @xmath51 where @xmath50 is positive and roughly constant , ( 2 ) the region from @xmath52 where @xmath50 flips sign as the debris passes through the south galactic pole to shift the galactic longitudes of the trailing arm by @xmath53 , and ( 3 ) @xmath54 , where @xmath50is negative and becomes smaller with decreasing @xmath37 ( because the sgr stream becomes increasingly farther ) . the sign flip in @xmath50 is a useful happenstance in the case where one has @xmath6 data not tied to an absolute reference frame but which is at least robust to systematic zonal errors : in this case the peak to peak amplitude of @xmath50 for the trailing arm stars yields ( two times ) the reflex motion of the sun and @xmath55 ; note that technically @xmath56 . ] .    the intrinsic rv dispersion of the sgr trailing arm has been measured to be @xmath4110 km s@xmath25",
    "( majewski et al .",
    "2004 ) ; assuming symmetry in the two transverse dimensions of the stream gives an intrinsic @xmath6 dispersion of the sgr trailing arm of @xmath410.1 mas yr@xmath25 ( see fig .",
    "thus , until sim - quality proper motions exist , the measurement of the reflex solar motion by this method will be dominated by the error in @xmath6 . to quantify the accuracy of the proposed method",
    ", we introduce artificial random errors into the proper motions of the five models shown in figure 3 and calculate the accuracy with which we expect to recover the solar reflex motion .    simply applying the formalism described above",
    ", we recover @xmath3 values of speed of the sun with respect to the lsr . ]",
    "212 , 255 , and 279 km s@xmath25 in models for which input @xmath57 and 260 km s@xmath25 respectively . this indicates that the method systematically overpredicts @xmath3 by about 30 km s@xmath25 ; this is because ( see fig .",
    "3 ) the trend of @xmath35 with @xmath58 is not perfectly flat but changes by @xmath59 km s@xmath25 between the peaks at @xmath60 and 115 - 120@xmath36 . correcting for this systematic bias , we perform 1000 tests where we randomly draw particles from the model debris streams in these ranges with artificially added random scatter in the @xmath6 , and find that recovering the solar velocity to within 10 km s@xmath25 requires a sample of approximately 200 stars with @xmath6 measured to about 1 mas yr@xmath25 precision with no zonal systematics . using the models with @xmath61 180/220/260 km s@xmath25",
    ", these tests recover mean values of 182/225/249 km s@xmath25 respectively with a dispersion of results between the tests of 10 km s@xmath25 . as expected from figure 3",
    ", varying @xmath43 and @xmath0 has negligible effect : tests on models in both of these mw potentials ( where @xmath62 km s@xmath25 ) recover mean values of 225 and 228 km s@xmath25 .",
    "present astrometric catalogs are just short of being able to do this experiment : hipparcos is not deep enough , the southern proper motion survey ( girard et al . 2004 ) has not yet covered enough appropriate sky area , and ucac2 ( zacharias et al .",
    "2004 ) has several times larger random errors than useful as well as comparably - sized zonal systematic errors at relevant magnitudes ( n. zacharias , private communication ) . however , to demonstrate how only modest advances in all - sky @xmath6 precisions are needed to make a definitive measurement , figure 4 includes a direct comparison of the @xmath50 trend for sgr m giants using ucac2 @xmath6 s for 2mass m giants .",
    "impressively , the overall expected @xmath50 trends can be seen , but the large scatter and systematic shifts in the trailing arm motions belie the limits of ucac2 accuracies at @xmath63 .",
    "even a factor of two improvement in ucac2 random errors _ and _ elimination of zonal errors might lead to a useful measurement of @xmath3 .",
    "it is not unreasonable to expect advances in all - sky @xmath6 catalogues at this level soon ( e.g. , from the origins billion star survey or gaia ) , but in any case sim planetquest will _ easily _ obtain the necessary @xmath6 ( and parallaxes ) of selected sgr trailing arm giants .",
