    "after many years of research very little is known for certain about the two components of the dark sector : cold dark matter ( dm ) and dark energy ( de ) .",
    "the latter , possibly in the form of a cosmological constant , appears to be the agent driving the current phase of cosmic accelerated expansion .",
    "thus , some basic questions immediately arise .",
    "for instance , is the cosmological constant a manifestation of the quantum vacuum ?",
    "if so , the huge gap between the de density expected from quantum field theory and the observed one is in urgent need of explanation @xcite . likewise , why are the densities of dm and de of the same order precisely today ?",
    "why are we living in such a special epoch i.e. ,  why now ? \"",
    "this constitutes the so - called  coincidence problem \" .",
    "also , do dm and de interact gravitationally only or are they coupled ?",
    "there is little doubt that these fundamental questions must be interrelated whereby shedding light on one of them may help to explain the others . following this line of thought",
    "we focus on the why now problem , hoping that if it is better understood , it will mean a major step in unveiling the nature of the components of the dark sector .",
    "notice that because of our current lack of knowledge about the nature of these two components it would be unwise to discard _ a priori _ an interaction among them .",
    "what is more , they should be coupled unless some so far unknown - symmetry forbids it . besides , data obtained from observations of the dynamics of galaxy clusters @xcite and the integrated sachs - wolfe effect @xcite hint that indeed they interact with one another , de slowly decaying in dm .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the first proposal on theoretical grounds that what we now call dark energy may decay into matter and radiation was made as early as 1933 by bronstein @xcite .",
    "later on , wetterich @xcite , micheletti , abdalla , and wang @xcite , polyakov @xcite , and abdalla , graef , and wang @xcite , among others , reinforced the theoretical framework . as we write",
    ", the number of proposals ( both from the theoretical as well as from the phenomenological side ) has been greatly augmented -see e.g. @xcite , and references therein .    here",
    "we shall assume that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic at large scales , with flat spatial sections , dominated by nonbaryonic cold matter , by dark energy , and ( to a lesser extent ) by baryons ( subscripts @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , respectively ) .",
    "we neglect radiation , as it results as dynamically unimportant at the epochs we are interested in .",
    "the overall energy conservation equation reads @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 denotes the total pressure of the cosmic fluid , and @xmath7 is the hubble factor . in the customary description of the expansion dm and de evolve independently , as no interaction other than gravity is considered .",
    "however , there is no apparent reason why they should not interact .",
    "so , in general , they must couple through some small term @xmath8 : @xmath9 @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the equation of state parameter of de , which for the sake of easiness we will assume to be constant .",
    "notice that the last two equations , together with the independent conservation of @xmath12 , guarantee the fulfilment of ( [ eq : conservation1 ] ) .",
    "the next section introduces , on a phenomenological basis , appropriate expressions for @xmath8 restricted by the conditions of simplicity , smallness , and positivity .",
    "the latter comes from the result that a negative @xmath8 would violate the second law of thermodynamics @xcite ; i.e. , the energy transfer must go from de to dm , not the other way around , in conformity with the findings of refs .",
    "likewise , @xmath8 must be small ( i.e. , it should be bound by @xmath13 ) ; otherwise , the dm could still dominate the expansion today .",
    "a key quantity in interacting scenarios is the ratio between dm and de , @xmath14 . in general , we expect it to monotonically decrease with expansion . equations ( [ eq : conservation - m ] ) and ( [ eq : conservation - x ] ) imply @xmath15 thus , the coincidence problem will be alleviated if @xmath16 decreases with expansion slower than in the conventional @xmath0cdm model , and much more so if for an extended expanse of time around the present epoch the right - hand side of the last expression stays close to zero . obviously , for any of them to occur , @xmath8 must be positive definite .",
    "in general , @xmath17 should be negative at all times .",
    "this leads to a further upper bound on @xmath8 : @xmath18 that may well be satisfied .",
    "indeed , at early times one expects @xmath16 and @xmath7 to be much larger than their respective current values ; and at times later than the present one , one expects both of them to be smaller . in general , if it were not so ( i.e. , if @xmath19 were positive at late times ) , then the deceleration parameter , @xmath20 , some time in the future would evolve from negative to positive values , conflicting with the second law of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "thus , the bound above is not at all unreasonable .",
    "the aim of this paper is twofold : first , to explore to what extent some specific interactions terms ( i.e. , q ) alleviate the coincidence problem and , second , to investigate how accurate measurements of @xmath21 must be to tell us , for the chosen _ astze _ , whether there really is an interaction in the dark sector .",
    "we believe this research is well justified in view of the progress made in the recent years on the observational side . indeed , it is not an exaggeration to say that we are living in an exciting time for cosmology .",
    "currently , there are a number of ongoing surveys and many more are planned -see sec .",
    "14 of ref .",
    "the assured result is that the frontier of our knowledge on cosmology will be pushed rather far away . in the next two decades",
    ", measurements of @xmath21 will be improved from the current accuracy of roughly @xmath22 to better than @xmath23 .",
    "this will allow one to test cosmological models with unprecedented confidence .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : section ii presents two classes of interactions ( i and ii ) and recalls the solutions to the conservation equations for the interaction _ anstze _ adopted that have analytical solution .",
    "section iii investigates whether these models really address the coincidence problem .",
    "section iv makes forecasts about detecting an interaction based on measurements of the hubble parameter .",
    "section v summarizes our findings and makes some final comments .",
    "as is usual , a subscript zero denotes the current value of the corresponding quantity .",
    "> from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : conservation - m ] ) and ( [ eq : conservation - x ] ) , @xmath8 must be a function of the energy densities multiplied by a quantity with units of inverse of time .",
    "for the latter we may take the hubble expansion rate ; thus , @xmath24 . by power - law",
    "expanding last expression and retaining just the first term , we arrive to the first class of interacting models : @xmath25 where the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 are small positive - semidefinite constants .",
    "this class , with @xmath28 , leads a constant ratio , @xmath16 , at late times , thus solving the coincidence problem @xcite .    as a further class we consider @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are non - negative , small , constant time rates ( by  small \" we mean smaller than @xmath32 ) .",

    "[ fig : cp_q1_w-10 ] ) , they limit the range which @xmath16 varies in the past ( left panel ) , future ( middle panel ) , or both past and future ( right panel ) . while this does not help to clarify why @xmath16 is of the order of unity today , it narrows the range @xmath16 spans .",
    "for instance , model @xmath47 ( right panel of fig . [ fig : cp_q1_w-10 ] ) limits @xmath16 in the range @xmath90 - @xmath91 ( for @xmath92 ) , thus alleviating the coincidence problem .",
    "similarly , models @xmath39 ( left panel ) and @xmath44 ( middle panel ) narrow the allowed range of @xmath16 in the past and future , respectively . in this sense ,",
