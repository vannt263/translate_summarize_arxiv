    "since 1982 there have been many reports of large - scale structures ( lsss ) in the distribution of quasars and related objects .",
    "these structures have now become generally known as large quasar groups ( lqgs ) .",
    "they are the largest structures so far seen in the early universe ( @xmath6 0.42.0 ) , with sizes in the range 70250  mpc , and memberships @xmath7 .",
    "the @xcite lqg , at redshift @xmath8 and with a longest dimension of @xmath4 250  mpc , is a particularly large example of lss in the early universe .",
    "for some of the historical development of work on lqgs see , for example : @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ( for radio galaxies ) ; @xcite ; and @xcite .",
    "lqgs are of interest not only as examples of large - scale features in the early universe but also because of their potential for : investigations of the lss in galaxies ; for indicating places in which to look for high-@xmath5 clusters ; and for identifying the environments that favour the formation of quasars .",
    "@xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) considered that lqgs denote the precursors at high redshifts of the superclusters seen today .",
    "@xcite similarly considered that lqgs may be `` incipient superclusters '' and also concluded that a substantial fraction of quasars lie two - dimensionally , in sheets . among some of the earliest papers in this area ,",
    "@xcite considered the possibility that quasars reside in superclusters to be a natural explanation for the occurrence of wide - angle doublets and triplets of quasars of very similar redshifts .",
    "@xcite showed that the `` great wall '' of galaxies @xcite at @xmath9 is traced by its agn .",
    "more recently , @xcite found that quasars and luminous red galaxies cross - correlate on scales @xmath10 40  mpc for @xmath11 . @xcite and @xcite showed that , at the low redshifts @xmath12 , quasars tended to follow the lss in clusters of galaxies , but were preferentially associated with the peripheries of clusters .",
    "( see also * ? ? ? * and further references in that paper . ) for the @xcite lqg at @xmath13 , a similar result was found by @xcite for five of its quasars : they followed a chain of clusters ( or groups ) but were associated with the peripheries .",
    "@xcite found three quasars in the vicinity of a supercluster at @xmath14 that are presumed to be associated , while being separated from the two component clusters by @xmath4 717 mpc .",
    "for the clowes & campusano lqg , @xcite found that one quasar is simultaneously on the peripheries of two clusters ( or groups ) of red galaxies , together with a band of blue , presumably star - forming , galaxies .",
    "the association of two further quasars from the clowes & campusano lqg with clusters or their peripheries is less apparent @xcite , and one at least of these may be quite isolated .",
    "there is evidence for general sheet - like enhancements of red galaxies with embedded clusters associated with this lqg @xcite .",
    "@xcite similarly find evidence for enhancements of candidates for lyman - break galaxies associated with it .",
    "a direct association ( i.e.  using spectroscopic redshifts rather than photometric estimates ) of the clowes & campusano lqg with an excess of galaxies has been achieved via mgii absorbers in background quasars , which showed a @xmath4 200 per cent excess in the redshift interval @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the investigation of lqgs was for many years made difficult by the limitations of quasar surveys .",
    "surveys tended to be small , or larger but not very deep , or affected by selection effects , and so on .",
    "compilations of different surveys increased the numbers of quasars but generally worsened the selection effects . in recent years , however , the difficulties with quasar data have been substantially lessened by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the two - degree field ( 2df ) qso redshift survey ( 2qz , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite and @xcite have investigated lss in the 2qz quasars , with miller et al .  finding @xmath4 200  mpc structures in a statistical sense , and pilipenko more specifically giving coordinates and other properties of the lqgs discovered .",
    "in particular , pilipenko suggests that there might be two categories of lqg : ( i ) size @xmath4 85  mpc , membership @xmath4 6 - 8 , overdensity @xmath4 10 ; and ( ii ) size @xmath4 200  mpc , membership @xmath16 , overdensity @xmath4 4 . note that these overdensities are substantially larger than those found by @xcite using spherical filtering .",
    "the @xcite lqg is , as mentioned above , a particularly large structure in the early universe .",
    "it was discovered by effectively random spatial sampling of quasar candidates from an objective - prism survey .",
    "this sampling was necessary for homogeneous coverage of a large area ( @xmath4 25 deg@xmath17 ) by single - object spectroscopy at a time when it was not feasible with multi - object spectroscopy .",
    "the field of the clowes & campusano lqg is now contained within the sdss .",
    "this paper considers what additional properties of the lqg and its cosmological neighbourhood can be deduced using the sdss quasars , given their wide - angle coverage and almost complete multi - object spectroscopy .",
    "the results presented here indicate that both the clowes & campusano lqg and a newly - discovered neighbouring lqg are among the largest features so far seen in the early universe . in this context",
    ", we note that there have been some reports of still larger correlations .",
    "@xcite presented preliminary evidence for gpc - scale correlations of galaxies , and @xcite and @xcite both found power on gpc - scales in the power spectrum of sdss galaxies .",
    "a particularly striking result is that of @xcite , who found that the polarisation vectors of quasars are correlated on gpc - scales .",
    "note that the concordance model is adopted for cosmological calculations , with @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21  kms@xmath22mpc@xmath22 .",
    "all sizes given are proper sizes at the present epoch .",
    "the sdss dr7 quasar catalogue (  dr7qso  , * ? ? ? * ) of 105783 quasars has been used for this work .",
    "schneider et al .",
    "note that the catalogue does not constitute a statistical sample ( i.e.  a sample with homogeneous selection ) and refer to @xcite and @xcite for detailed discussion of the important properties of completeness and efficiency of the parent survey .",
    "in particular , @xcite describe how to construct a statistical sample from the dr3qso catalogue , in a discussion which should also be applicable to the dr7qso catalogue .",
    "however , because the requirement here is for assessing the spatial connectivity of quasars across intervals on the sky of @xmath23 and intervals of redshift @xmath24 , rather than for the luminosity function , the criteria of richards et al .  can be relaxed .",
    "firstly , the redshifts @xmath25 of main interest are well within the limit @xmath26 of the low - redshift strand of selection so the changes in the sdss selection algorithms from the initial to the final @xcite should not be important .",
    "secondly , satisfactory spatial uniformity of selection on the sky for these redshifts should be achievable by selecting @xmath27 @xcite , since those quasars are predominantly from the low - redshift selection strand , which is limited to @xmath27 .",
    "for this re - examination of the clowes & campusano lqg we use the entire dr7qso catalogue of @xmath4 9380  deg@xmath17 , limited to @xmath27 .",
    "the coverage of the catalogue comprises a large main area for the north galactic cap ( ngc , @xmath4 7600  deg@xmath17 ) with some jagged boundaries , three equatorial stripes ( totalling @xmath4 800  deg@xmath17 ) and several distinct , smaller areas ( `` special plates '' ) .",
    "the lqg is in the main ngc area , and is @xmath4 5  deg from the nearest boundary .",
    "some nearby holes in the coverage that could be seen in the preceding dr5qso catalogue appear to be no longer present in dr7qso .",
    "of course , any candidate lqg elsewhere in the catalogue that encounters a boundary might not be completely identified .",
    "we shall denote the area of @xmath4 9380  deg@xmath17 as a9380 .",
    "we also define a control area , designated a3725 , of @xmath4 3725 deg@xmath17 ( actually 3724.5 deg@xmath17 ) by ra : @xmath28 and dec : @xmath29 .",
    "a3725 is chosen to be a large area well separated from the lqg .",
    "note that the relatively bright limiting magnitude , @xmath27 , of the sdss low - redshift selection strand is not ideal for the tasks of finding and further investigating lqgs .",
    "the difficulty is possibly illustrated by @xcite , who finds lqgs in the fainter 2qz data ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but finds no significant groups beyond doublets and triplets in the dr5qso @xcite , although the adoption of a small linkage scale ( 57  mpc compared with mean separation of 83  mpc ) for the dr5qso seems likely to have also been a very substantial factor in their apparent absence .",
    "the identification of lsss by algorithms can be quite subtle , especially concerning the effective and objective specification of factors such as the linkage scale and overdensity .",
    "the discovery of the clowes & campusano lqg was reported in @xcite , with a later revision , following some additional observations , given by @xcite .",
    "from these two papers , the lqg was detected as 18 quasars in the redshift range @xmath30 , of which 15 were new discoveries and three were previously known . at the time of the observations multi - object spectroscopy across the whole survey area of 25.3 deg@xmath17 was not practicable and , instead , wide - area coverage was achieved by effectively random spatial sampling of the quasar candidates for single - object spectroscopy . although the magnitude limit of @xmath31 for the sdss low - redshift strand is brighter than the clowes & campusano limit of @xmath32 there should be many further sdss quasars in the range @xmath33 because of the complete wide - area coverage .",
    "note that of the 18 original lqg members , 10 are present in the dr7qso catalogue with @xmath34 , and a further two are present with @xmath35 .",
    "ten further quasars with @xmath30 in the region of the lqg are known from a later uv - excess survey ( the chile - uk quasar survey : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with @xmath36 and of incomplete spatial coverage .",
    "of these 10 , eight are present in the dr7qso catalogue , all with @xmath27 .",
    "( one of these eight has a dr7qso redshift slightly greater than 1.4 . )    in @xcite the assessment of significance of the lqg made use of the two - dimensional minimal spanning tree ( mst ) of the ra , dec coordinates .",
    "this paper uses three - dimensional single - linkage hierarchical clustering , which is equivalent to the three - dimensional mst .",
    "these mst - type algorithms have the great advantage that they do not require assumptions about the morphology of the structure . with their use",
    "there are at least three parameters needed to specify the lqgs  the linkage scale , the number of members , and the overdensity .",
    "usually the analyses concentrate on a chosen linkage scale .",
    "@xcite discusses two possibilities for making the choice : ( i ) the physical , in which one chooses the scale that maximises the fraction of groups that match closely some specified physical parameters ( e.g.  size , membership , density ) ; and ( ii ) the formal , in which , for example , one might choose the scale that maximises the number of groups found ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "note that some lqgs found at one linkage scale may be fragments of lqgs that would be found completely at a larger linkage scale .",
    "the mean nearest - neighbour separation is an objective measure that can be used to guide the choice of linkage scale . for the redshifts of interest here , @xmath8 ,",
    "the mean nearest - neighbour separation calculated from area a3725 ( as @xmath37 ) is @xmath4 74  mpc .",
    "note that this nearest - neighbour separation is a true , physical , separation , determined globally by the number of points in a particular volume .",
    "however , the linkage in practice between any two quasars is an apparent separation incorporating the true separation plus distortions that arise from the contributions to the redshifts of observational uncertainties and peculiar velocities .",
    "several papers quote estimates for the observational redshift uncertainties of sdss quasars : 0.004 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* dr7 ) ; 0.006 ( * ? ? ? * dr5 ) ; @xmath38 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* dr3 , @xmath39 ) ; @xmath4 0.01 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* dr5 , @xmath40 ) ; 0.0030.01 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* compilation ) .",
    "the value of 0.006 from @xcite refers to a difference of redshifts so we should divide it by @xmath41 to obtain the uncertainty for a single measurement , 0.004 , which is the same as the value from @xcite .",
    "we adopt the @xcite uncertainty of @xmath42 as a representative dr7 value .",
    "the mean redshift of the dr7qso quasars with @xmath43 is @xmath44 so this value of the uncertainty should be appropriate to the redshifts of interest here . note that the sdss data processing @xcite attempts to correct for the redshift offsets between high- and low - ionisation emission lines ( @xmath4 600  kms@xmath22 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and so this possible source of distortion is not considered further here . @xcite",
    "have provided a catalogue of revised redshifts for sdss dr6 quasars that corrects for small systematic offsets in the sdss redshifts , reduces the redshift uncertainties , and provides an estimate of the redshift uncertainty for the individual quasars ( typically @xmath45 ) .",
    "however , dr6 contains large gaps in the sky coverage compared with dr7 .    if we assume that quasars have peculiar velocities in the radial direction of @xmath4 400  kms@xmath22 then there is a further random component to the redshift @xmath46 at @xmath8 . ] . combining @xmath42 and @xmath46 in quadrature , gives the typical distortion in position of a quasar of @xmath4 11  mpc at @xmath8 .",
    "the corresponding distortion in pairwise separations is then @xmath4 16  mpc .",
    "thus a set of quasars that forms a unit at a true linkage scale of 73  mpc would be very likely to appear fragmented for apparent linkage scales @xmath4 90  mpc .",
    "the detection of the lqg in the dr7qso catalogue is considered below for linkage scales in the range 75105  mpc .",
    "the upper limit of this range is set to be smaller than the expected percolation radius for a poisson distribution @xcite , which , for @xmath8 and a3725 , is @xmath4 115  mpc .",
    "this range of 30  mpc was explored by a binary chop rather than by a series of equal increments .",
    "the redshift distribution for the dr7qso catalogue with @xmath27 is fairly flat across the interval 1.01.8 and so this is the range that has been considered in practice , rather than simply 1.21.4 .    using the _ agnes _ algorithm in the _ r package _ for single - linkage hierarchical clustering ,",
    "a unit of 34 quasars emerges at a linkage scale of 100  mpc that , given evidence presented below , appears to be the lqg . at the other linkage scale considered in the binary chop , 90  mpc",
    ", the lqg does not appear at the specified minimum cluster size of 10 members .",
    "the apparent linkage scale of 100  mpc thus means that the lqg is unlikely to be fragmenting at the true mean nearest - neighbour separation @xmath4 73  mpc .",
    "( note that this scale of 100  mpc is between the two scales \\{@xmath47 , @xmath48  mpc diameters , equivalent to @xmath49 , @xmath50  mpc radii } for spherical filtering used by @xcite to find lqgs . )",
    "the 34 quasars connected at this 100  mpc linkage scale are listed in table  [ lqg_u1.28_table ] .",
    "their mean redshift is 1.28 , identical to that of the original 18 members of the lqg .",
    "they cover the redshift range @xmath51 , whereas the original 18 cover the range @xmath52 .",
    "the centroids of this unit of 34 and of the original 18 are separated by only @xmath53 .",
    "the identification as the lqg of this unit of 34 , occurring at the correct redshift , within @xmath54 , and also ( see the next section ) with essentially the same western , northern and southern boundaries , therefore seems certain .    for convenience in what follows ,",
    "this lqg unit of 34 quasars will be designated u1.28 from its mean redshift , and similarly for two other units of interest that are discussed below .",

    "the location on the sky of the 34 members of u1.28 corresponds well to that of the original lqg : the western , northern and southern boundaries seem to be essentially the same , apart from two compact clumps to the north and south - west , ( fig .

    "note that for the original 18 only the western boundary did not encounter the limits of the survey , but the extension seen with u1.28 is predominantly eastwards , with no major extensions either northwards or southwards .",

    "while investigating the appearance of the clowes & campusano lqg in the sdss data two further ( candidate ) lqgs became apparent in the same general direction on the sky .",
    "we were considering only units with a minimum membership of 20 at the 100  mpc linkage scale .",
    "these additional candidate lqgs are designated as u1.11 and u1.54 , from their mean redshifts .",
    "u1.11 has 38 members , @xmath2 , and angular separation ( of ra , dec centroids ) of 1.97@xmath66 from u1.28 .",

    "we find that u1.28 and u1.11 are significant , but u1.54 is not .",

    "[ zdist_a47 ] for the intervals @xmath64 and @xmath65 , which were mentioned briefly in the earlier discussion of that figure , correspond to u1.11 and u1.54 .",

    "of these , u1.28 and u1.11 are the closest , with a separation of centroids of @xmath71  mpc . from the density of such candidates ,",
    "the probability of a pair within this separation occurring by chance somewhere within the coverage of the whole catalogue ( and @xmath72 ) is @xmath73 , and so this pair is consistent .",
    "note , however , that u1.28 and u1.11 do appear to be quite distinct : a small increase in the linkage scale does not lead to their merger as a single unit .",
    "the volume occupied by u1.28 and u1.11 together thus appears rather distinctive for quasars on a large scale and would presumably correspond to some notable features in the cosmic web if the distribution of galaxies was accessible to observation . as mentioned above , and as is apparent from figure  [ units_project ] , u1.28 and u.11 are also quite closely aligned with the line of sight .",
    "groups found by the linkage of points generally require a separate procedure to assess statistical significance .",
    "@xcite considered this problem previously , and created the @xmath74 method , which requires that groups show significant sub - clustering ; @xcite addressed it differently by counting the frequency of comparable groups in random sets .",
    "a procedure is also needed to estimate overdensities . @xcite",
    "estimated overdensity from properties of the mst , which method is convenient but was not justified in that paper . in this section",
    "we present a new procedure based on the convex hull that we can use for both statistical significance and overdensity .",
    "we use a measure of the volume occupied by a lqg to assess the statistical significance and estimate the overdensity : a lqg must occupy a smaller volume than the expectation for the same number of random points .    a simple way to estimate",
    "the volume is to define a `` ra - dec - z box '' with corners determined by the ra , dec , z limits of the lqg .",
    "however , since lqgs are typically not cuboids aligned with the coordinate axes , the box typically overestimates the volume quite severely .",
    "the ra - dec - z boxes will generally also include non - members and so their volumes are not then solely those of the lqgs .",
    "another way to estimate the volume is to use the volume of the convex hull .",
    "however , the convex hull typically underestimates the volume ( although overestimates are also possible , depending on morphology ) because it can wrap tightly around the surface points and does not then consider any surrounding region as belonging to them .    we can construct a measure of volume that should better reflect the volume occupied by the lqg than either the ra - dec - box or the convex hull of the points .",
    "we do this by expanding each member point of a unit to be a sphere , with radius set to be half of the mean linkage ( mst edge length ) of the unit . in this way , each point is associated with a spherical volume .",
    "we then take the volume of the lqg to be the volume of the convex hull of these spheres .",
    "we shall refer to this method as the chms method  convex hull of member spheres .",
    "note that this measure refers to the lqg members only , unlike the ra - dec - z box , which typically incorporates non - members too .",
    "the distribution of chms volumes resulting from random points that have been distributed with known density allows the statistical significance of a lqg to be assessed .",
    "the chms volumes for sets of random points can also be used to estimate residual biases and , if required , make corrections to the chms volumes , densities and overdensities for lqgs .",
    "the residual bias is expressed as a volume correction , which is the ratio of the known volume of the sets of random points to their mean chms volume .",
    "it corrects for imperfections , of consequence only at the lower memberships , in reproducing the true volume with the above ( natural ) choice of sphere radius . the observed chms volume for a lqg",
    "can then be corrected by multiplying by the appropriate volume correction .    for assessing the statistical significance of a lqg of membership",
    "@xmath75 , we compare the departure of its chms volume ( uncorrected , since there is no need for the corrections here ) from the mean of the distribution of chms volume for 1000 random sets of @xmath75 .",
    "each random set is defined by distributing @xmath75 points in a cube , of volume such that the density in the cube corresponds to the density in a3725 for the redshift limits of the lqg . in this way",
    ", we find that the departures from random expectations for u1.28 , u1.11 and u1.54 are respectively @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 .",
    "u1.54 thus appears as not significant , although , as we have mentioned above , it is a re - discovery , with an independent sample , of a lqg that was previously known @xcite , albeit at marginal significance then also .    after correcting the chms volumes for residual bias the estimated overdensities of the significant lqgs are @xmath79 for u1.28 and u1.11 respectively .",
    "( the volume corrections are @xmath4 10 and 8 per cent respectively . )",
    "@xcite gives a method for determining the overdensity of a lqg that avoids defining the containing volume , but gave no justification for it and did not discuss possible biases . in this method ,",
    "the overdensity is defined to be @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is mst edge - length for the lqg and @xmath82 is mst edge - length for a control area elsewhere . here",
    "we modify this definition by including the `` @xmath83 '' that is more usual for overdensities , giving @xmath84 . recall that the mst is equivalent to the single - linkage hierarchical clustering used in this paper . for this method",
    "we obtain @xmath85 for u1.28 and u1.11 respectively , with @xmath82 having been obtained from the control area a3725 separately for the redshift range of each unit .",
    "the overdensities by the pilipenko method are thus higher for u1.11 than for our chms method .    the chms overdensities here , @xmath86 0.5 - 0.9 , are substantially lower than those found by @xcite and a little higher than those found by @xcite",
    ". the two pilipenko categories , as mentioned above are : ( i ) size @xmath4 85  mpc , membership @xmath4 6 - 8 , overdensity @xmath4 10 ( or 9 with the `` @xmath83 '' ) ; and ( ii ) size @xmath4 200  mpc , membership @xmath16 , overdensity @xmath4 4 ( or 3 with the `` @xmath83 '' ) .",
    "the overdensities from @xcite are calculated for spherical top - hat filtering , giving @xmath87 for 100@xmath88  mpc diameters and @xmath89 for 200@xmath88  mpc diameters .",
    "this paper has re - examined the @xcite lqg , originally known with 18 members , using data from the sdss dr7qso catalogue .",
    "it is found as the unit u1.28 of 34 100mpc - linked quasars , with mean redshift @xmath0 .",
    "while the western , northern and southern boundaries remain essentially unchanged , apart from two compact clumps to the north and south - west , there is an extension eastwards , beyond the original survey , of @xmath1 .",
    "a new lqg , u1.11 , was discovered in the same direction  1.97@xmath66 from u1.28 .",
    "it has 38 members and mean redshift @xmath2 . a third candidate , u1.54 , in the same direction at 1.62@xmath66 from u1.28 , appeared statistically insignificant , although it is a re - discovery of a known ( marginal ) lqg @xcite .",
    "we have also presented the `` chms method '' for assessing the statistical significance and overdensity of groups such as lqgs that have been found by linkage of points .",
    "attention was first drawn to peculiarities in this area of sky by cannon & oke ( @xmath4 1980 , private communication ) who , in the early days of quasar surveys , noted the unusual ease with which they could find the then hard - to - find quasars with @xmath6 1.0 - 1.6 .",
    "it may be that , now we know there are not one but two lqgs of unusually high membership in this direction , we finally have the complete explanation of their result .",
    "a simple measure of the characteristic size of the lqgs , which takes no account of morphology , is the cube root of the corrected chms volumes , giving @xmath90  mpc for u1.28 and u1.11 respectively .",
    "clearly these are very large sizes , placing these two lqgs among the largest features so far seen in the early universe . for comparison ,",
    "@xcite give an idealised limit to the scale of homogeneity in the concordance cosmology as @xmath4 370  mpc : it should not be possible to find departures from homogeneity above this scale .",
    "the lqgs appear to be only marginally consistent with this scale of homogeneity .",
    "calculation of the inertia tensor for these two lqgs shows a ratio @xmath91 for the longest and shortest principal axes in both cases .",
    "they are therefore substantially elongated . by this measure",
    "the longest axes are @xmath4 630 and 780  mpc for u1.28 and u1.11 respectively .",
    "their morphologies appear to be markedly oblate , like a thick lens , each with two comparably large long axes and a short axis that is smaller by the factor @xmath91 .",
    "clearly the long axes do exceed the expected scale of homogeneity .",
    "the estimated overdensities are @xmath92 , @xmath93 for u1.28 and u1.11 respectively .",
    "these overdensities are substantially lower than those found by @xcite and a little higher than those found by @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of structure on a particular scale is naturally taken to mean that the universe is not homogeneous on that scale .",
    "these two lqgs , u1.28 and u1.11 , as overdensities of the amplitudes and scales indicated , thus raise a question of compatibility with the scale of homogeneity in the concordance cosmology , if the @xcite fractal calculations are adopted as reference . a counter argument could be made that these lqgs are chance associations of groups on sub - homogeneity scales , analogous to the finding of @xcite that the component superclusters of the sloan great wall have different evolutionary histories .",
    "even if this were true , homogeneity asserts that any global property of sufficiently large volumes should be the same within the expected statistical variations , so the density of quasars in these lqgs would remain distinctive .",
    "of course , unknown observational biases or selection effects could conceivably also affect the overall dimensions of the lqgs .",
    "in finding compatibility of lqgs with concordance cosmology @xcite noted that they had not considered questions of shape and topology .",
    "given both the large sizes and elongated morphology that we find for u1.28 and u1.11 we have begun a programme to re - investigate compatibility , using the full set of lqgs that we find from the dr7qso catalogue .",
