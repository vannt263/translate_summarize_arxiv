    "grafting solutions for the spin@xmath84 structures @xmath248 and @xmath249 together we get 4 basic classes unless @xmath171 or @xmath250 . since @xmath15 has exactly two basic classes and @xmath249 is nonspin ( therefore @xmath251 ) we get that @xmath171 , consequently @xmath1 is spin .      for a stein filling @xmath1 consider @xmath253 .",

    "the part of theorem  [ 235 ] about @xmath62 follows from the fact that @xmath62 does not bound negative definite 4-manifold at all : if @xmath259 and @xmath260 then @xmath261 violates donaldson s theorem  [ dona ] .      1 .   a similar proof of the above theorem was already found by ohta and ono @xcite .",

    "according to @xcite , the 3-manifold @xmath59 admits a unique fillable ( in fact , a unique tight ) contact structure .",
    "notice that in our proof we made no assumption on the contact structure on @xmath59 .",
