    "during last several decades wormhole has been attracting attention to the scientific community a lot after since publication of the seminal work by  @xcite . in this paper",
    "they argued the possibility of the existence of traversable wormholes permitting to travel through space and time .",
    "actually , a wormhole does act role for a passage / tunnel in spacetime which is supposed to connect the widely separated regions of our universe or different universes in the multiverse model . according to  @xcite ,",
    "the normal matter is unable to hold a wormhole open rather the matter is responsible for sustaining a traversable wormhole is exotic in nature which violates the standard null energy condition .    by drawing our attention to the galactic level where one can notice a kind of peculiar phenomena known as the flat rotation curves in galaxies",
    "now , the ordinary luminous matters in space are composed mainly of neutral hydrogen clouds .",
    "but this bizarre galactic rotation curves can not be explained by the standard model .",
    "therefore , to explain the rotation curves in the outer regions of galaxies it has been supposed that galaxies and even clusters of galaxies must contain some non - luminous matter .",
    "this kind of exotic stuff , now known as dark matter , does not emit electromagnetic waves nor interact with normal matter .",
    "it has arguably proved by the scientists that dark matter can explain properly the so called flat rotation curves .    in the previous some studies in connection to flat rotation curves",
    "@xcite we have used _ ad hoc _ functional forms of rotation velocity . however , by using the experimental data of the rotational velocities at different distance of outer regions of galaxies , we have estimated fifth degree polynomial that yields the expression for the velocity as a function of the radial coordinate @xmath0 which is almost of the same nature of the experimental feature .",
    "thus in this paper , we study the exact observational results and confirm the existence of wormhole in all the galaxies containing the dark matter .",
    "these dark matters actually play the role of fuel for developing wormhole - like geometry .",
    "this study is a combination of einstein s theory and experimental result , therefore , reasonably more physical than the previous studies  @xcite .",
    "to connect the dark matter and galactic rotation curves with wormholes one needs to introduce the metric for a static spherically symmetric spacetime . following  @xcite",
    "we consider here the line element for the galactic halo region in connection to wormhole spacetime as @xmath1 where @xmath2 in the geometrized unit .",
    "till now we have some idea regarding the density profile , however , other properties of dark matter yet to be explored .",
    "therefore , it is justified to assume that dark matter is characterized by the general anisotropic energy - momentum tensor  @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 are transverse and radial pressures , respectively .    using navarro - frenk - white ( nfw )  @xcite density profile and constant rotational velocity @xmath7",
    ",  @xcite has demonstrated the possible existence of wormholes in the outer regions of the galactic halo . in another study ,",
    "@xcite have used the universal rotation curve ( urc ) dark matter model and sample rotation curve utilizing an ansatz for @xmath7 to obtain analogous results for the central parts of the halo .",
    "this letter is a significant sequel of the earlier results in a more refined manner and therefore confirms the possible existence of wormholes in most of the galaxies .    basically by employing the experimental data of the rotational velocities of the outer regions of galaxies ,",
    "we have estimated fifth degree polynomial that yields the expression for the velocity as a function of the radial coordinate @xmath0 .",
    "the interpolation technique has been used to estimate this fifth degree polynomial .",
    "this rotational velocity is used to find the geometry of galactic halo regions within the framework of general theory of relativity .    as a background of the present study we would like to report here briefly about the necessary density profiles in the following two paragraphs .",
    "@xcite proposed from the predictions of standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology n - body simulations , the structure of dark halos , in particular the density profile of dark halos . their numerical simulations in the @xmath8-cdm scenarios led to the density profile of galaxies as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the characteristic scale radius and @xmath11 the corresponding density .",
    "this density profile of cdm halos fits accurately up to masses between @xmath12 .      according to the nfw model ,",
    "the velocities in the central parts are too low  @xcite , but in the outer regions of the halo it fits well . in this case",
    "we consider with the range from closer to the center to the outer region where the urc dark matter profile  @xcite is valid and given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the core radius and @xmath15 is the effective core density .",
    "the next ingredient is rotation curve regarding which it is believed that rotation curve analysis is one of the great support for the existence of dark matter in galaxies . by considering the @xmath16 data and also by adopting some radio rotation curves  @xcite have analyzed a large number of rotation curves and have argued that rotation curves can be fitted not only for any luminosity , but also for any type of galaxies ( may be spirals , low - surface - brightness ellipticals and dwarf - irregular galaxies ) .",
    "therefore they used the term universal rotation curve ( urc ) in stead of rotation curves .",
    "the tangential velocity  @xcite can be found from the flat rotation curve for the circular stable geodesic motion in the equatorial plane as @xmath17    the velocity @xmath18 in km / s of the rotation curve of the objects with total virial mass @xmath19 of solar masses in different radii @xmath0 in kpc is given in table 1  @xcite . by using interpolation technique  @xcite for the data given in table 1 , we have estimated fifth degree polynomial which is the best fitting curve that yields the expression for the velocity as a function of the radial coordinate @xmath0 .",
    "therefore the output can be presented as @xmath20    one can note that the velocity curve we obtained fits well with the observed tangential velocities in different distances ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    here , the velocity @xmath18 is given in km / s which is equivalent to  @xcite @xmath21     in kpc and the rotation velocity @xmath7 in km / sec respectively . ]",
    "now , the einstein field equations for the above metric ( [ e : line1 ] ) are @xmath22    @xmath23    @xmath24 \\nonumber \\\\=8\\pi p_{t}(r).\\label{e : ein3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from eqs .",
    "( [ e : v1 ] ) and ( [ e : v2 ] ) , one can get the expression for redshift function @xmath25 as @xmath26.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the solution of the same redshift function will be used to obtain the parameters from the einstein field equations for different cases .",
    "the logic behind this is that this redshift function is obtained from the observed rotational velocities of the different distance of outer regions of galaxies .",
    "we note that our solutions valid up from @xmath27  kpc to @xmath28  kpc . at the maximum distance of @xmath28  kpc , the redshift function does not approach to zero .",
    "this means wormhole spacetime considered here is not asymptotically flat and therefore @xmath28  kpc is the _ cut off _ radius where these solutions will be joined smoothly to an exterior vacuum solutions .",
    "also we note that the redshift function is finite in the range @xmath29 .",
    "this finiteness of the redshift function actually prevents the event horizon .",
    "now in the following , we will discuss two cases separately : for the outer regions of the halo with @xmath30 ( _ case 1 _ ) whereas for the central region with @xmath31 ( _ case 2 _ ) .",
    "the einstein field equation yields the shape function as @xmath32+c.\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is an integration constant .    after obtaining both @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    ", we now examine whether the spacetime possesses wormhole like geometry . from above",
    ", one can see that _ redshift function _ ( @xmath34 ) remains finite to prevent an event horizon .",
    "we assume that characteristic scale radius @xmath10 coincides with the throat radius of the wormhole , such that @xmath36 .",
    "this gives the value of the integration constant @xmath33 as @xmath37.\\ ] ]    now , we find @xmath38 , to check the so - called _ flare - out _ condition . for the values @xmath39 and @xmath40",
    ", we obtain that @xmath41 .",
    "thus the flare - out condition holds good .",
    "one can note that this result does not modify if we implement the accurate values of milky way for @xmath11 and @xmath10 found out by  @xcite .",
    "the radial and lateral pressures assume the following forms : @xmath42 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\times\\left(\\frac{f^{\\prime}}{r}\\right ) -\\frac{8\\pi \\rho_s r_s^3(\\ln(r+r_s)+\\frac{r_s}{r+r_s}+c)}{8\\pi r^3},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath43,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are given in eqs .",
    "( 11 ) and ( 12 ) respectively and @xmath44,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath45.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    fig .",
    "2 indicates that @xmath46 and therefore the null energy condition is violated to hold a wormhole open .          in this case the shape function",
    "can be found as @xmath47 + d\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is an integration constant .",
    "the radial and lateral pressures given by @xmath49    @xmath50 \\nonumber",
    "\\\\   \\times \\left[f^ { '' } + \\frac{f^{'}}{r}+ { f^{'}}^2-\\left\\{\\frac{b^{\\prime } r - b}{2r(r - b)}\\right\\}\\left(f^{\\prime}+\\frac{1}{r}\\right)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are given in eqs . ( 11 ) and ( 18 ) .",
    "one can check that the qualitative features meet all the requirements for the existence of a wormhole based on the urc model .",
    "therefore , it would be desirable to examine the solutions critically .",
    "we assume that the throat of the wormhole coincides with the core radius @xmath51 .",
    "as before , @xmath52 yields the value of the integration constant @xmath48 where @xmath53    the known throat radius permits a closer look on the flare - out condition , @xmath54 . using the observed values of the milky way galaxy , @xmath55  kpc  @xcite and @xmath56  kpc)@xmath57 g  cm @xmath58  @xcite",
    ", we get @xmath59    therefore , shape function obeys the flare - out condition . as before , fig .",
    "3 indicates that @xmath46 , therefore the null energy condition is violated to hold a wormhole open .",
    "recently , based on navarro - frenk - white ( nfw )  @xcite density profile and the universal rotation curve ( urc )  @xcite dark matter model ,  @xcite have shown that the galactic halo possesses the necessary properties for supporting traversable wormholes .",
    "the former is valid for outer region of the galaxies whereas the latter is valid for the central parts of the galactic halo . for both the studies",
    ", they used the _",
    "ad hoc _ functional forms of rotation velocity .    however , in this paper by using the experimental data of the rotational velocities at different distance of outer regions of galaxies , we have estimated fifth degree polynomial that yields the expression for the velocity as a function of the radial coordinate @xmath0 .",
    "this rotational velocity is used to find the geometry of galactic halo regions within the framework of general theory of relativity .",
    "the estimated rotational velocity function @xmath7 is well behaved within the range @xmath60 .",
    "we have used this rotational velocity function @xmath7 to find the spacetime geometries of outer region as well as central parts of the galactic halo . basically ,",
    "we have in hand the data of galactic rotational velocities from @xmath61 and we have estimated fifth degree polynomial which is the best fitted curve for velocity within this range .",
    "therefore , from our model we can not predict what happens in galactic centre .",
    "also the wormhole exists outside the core of the galactic halo .",
    "following  @xcite we have assumed core radius as 9.11 kpc .",
    "one can define the central region as 9.11 kpc up to 30 kpc and outer region as above 30 kpc . may be it needs further research to predict the event in the galactic centre .    in this respect",
    "it is to note that we do not know whether it is possible to explain the results without postulating the existence of wormholes , rather by attributing some specific physical properties to dark matter .",
    "however , according to our observations , the dark matter in the galactic halo region produces the spacetime geometry which is very similar to wormhole like geometry .",
    "the present study provides a clue for possible existence of wormholes in most of the galaxies and provides a theoretical platform to seek observational evidence for wormholes by studying the scattering of scaler waves or from past data using ordinary light as well as one can use the method of gravitational lensing as a possible experiment  @xcite .",
    "another suggestion have given by  @xcite that wormholes can be probed using light curves of gamma - ray bursts .",
