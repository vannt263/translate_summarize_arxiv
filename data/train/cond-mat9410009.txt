    "mean - field theory has long been a useful approximation for the study of phase transitions in a wide variety of systems , especially magnetic ones.@xcite this comes from the great simplification of dealing with an averaged system instead of explicitely taking into account each individual interaction . as is generally the case",
    ", the interest here in using mean - field theory is its ability to predict phase transitions and to follow the evolution of relevant quantities close to the transition point .",
    "unfortunately , transition points and critical exponents extracted from the mean - field theory are found to be significantly different from the experimental ones , especialy when the effective dimensionality is small .",
    "this is due to the averaging process involved which neglects the important critical fluctuations close to the transition point .",
    "although mean - field theory has some problems when applied directly to low dimensionality systems , it can be a very good approximation if used in conjunction with other techniques . by definition , quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-@xmath0 ) systems",
    "have a direction in which the energy scale is much larger than in the others .",
    "some numerical techniques such as classical transfer - matrix,@xcite quantum transfer - matrix,@xcite and bethe - ansatz@xcite can be used to solve almost exactly the @xmath0 part of the problem and so , instead of using mean - field for all the interactions , it can be restricted to the coupling between the chains.@xcite by doing this , important fluctuations , although not the critical ones , will be included and a more accurate solution can be expected .    the present work is mainly concerned with csnif@xmath1 and , to some extent other equivalent systems . in this hexagonal insulator , the @xmath2 ni@xmath3 ions are ferromagnetically coupled in chains , along with the f@xmath4 ions .",
    "the chains are well separated from each other by large cs@xmath5 ions and are coupled by antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "this arrangment causes a large spacial anisotropy between the ni ions , the ratio of the distance between these ions along the chains and in the basal plane being 0.4205 , with an interchain separation of 6.27  @xmath6 .",
    "anisotropy is thus present in the magnetic properties , the intrachain super - exchange ( @xmath7  20  k)@xcite being much larger than the interchain one .",
    "the exact ratio between the super - exchange interactions is difficult to estimate because of the strong dipolar interaction arising between the ferromagnetic chains .",
    "it is important to note that dipolar field is almost nonexistant if the ordering along the chains is antiferromagnetic ( af ) , as it is in many other abx@xmath1 compouds such as csmnbr@xmath1 and csnicl@xmath1.@xcite    this strong dipolar field is responsible for the particular planar af arrangement@xcite of csnif@xmath1 which is different from the expected 120@xmath8 structure of a system with only af interactions on a triangular lattice .",
    "this magnetic phase occurs for temperatures smaller than @xmath9  k.@xcite .",
    "et al._@xcite have also shown a strong dependence of the critical field as a function of the angle between the magnetic field and the chain axis .",
    "as an example , at @xmath10  k , @xmath11  t while for the other direction @xmath12  t. an unsuccesful attempt was made to fit this peculiar angular dependence of the critical field using a mean - field model similar to the one of refs .   and . in this paper , it will be shown that the experimental angular dependence is typical of a system formed by @xmath13 ferromagnetic chains with af coupling between them on a triangular lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the magnetic properties of such systems is given by : @xmath14 the first , third and fourth sums in equation ( [ hamil3d ] ) are along the chain while the second one is between nearest neighbors in the plane perpendicular to the chains axis .",
    "the strong @xmath13 behavior of csnif@xmath1 comes from its large single - ion anisotropy ( @xmath15 ) of 8.5  k.@xcite the @xmath16-value was set to 2.2 .    as mentioned previously",
    ", the usual mean - field theory uses averaged quantities for the three lattice dimensions .",
    "an example of this is found in ref .  .",
    "the goal of the present work is to develop a method which treats the chains by classical tranfer - matrix and uses mean - field for the coupling between them .",
    "this method , refered to as mftm ( mean - field transfer - matrix ) , is presented in section  ii .",
    "it is followed , in section  iii , by a brief review of the transfer - matrix algorithm used to calculate the magnetization and the susceptibility of a @xmath0 chain as a function of temperature and magnetic field . in section",
    "iv , mftm is applied to csnif@xmath1 for the calculation of its magnetic - field  temperature phase diagram and angular dependence of the critical field .",
    "some other general results , concerning single - ion anisotropy , are presented in section  v.",
    "before presenting the calculated phase diagram of csnif@xmath1 , it is useful to understand qualitatively the underlying mecanism of the magnetic order in this system . for simplicity , consider a starting point below t@xmath17 with a magnetic field oriented in the @xmath13 plane , large enough to destroy the af order . in this phase , the paramagnetic one ,",
    "the free - energy is dominated by a zeeman term , @xmath18 , and the magnetization @xmath19 is parallel to the applied field .",
    "as the field amplitude is lowered , this term is diminished up to a point where a perpendicular exchange term , proportional to @xmath20 , becomes equal to it . at this field , since @xmath21 , an af order develops and a finite angle between the magnetic sub - lattices appears .",
    "the critical field , @xmath22 , is defined where this angle is equal to zero .",
    "it is important to notice the particular planar structure of the magnetic order in csnif@xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ hexaplan ] ) which is different from the 120@xmath8 structure of csmnbr@xmath1 , an @xmath13 system having strong af coupling along the chains .",
    "this difference is due to the relatively strong dipolar field originating from the neighboring ferromagnetic chains@xcite .",
    "this dipolar field depends strongly on the angle between the magnetic sub - lattices and it can be shown quite easily that there is no interchain dipolar field present on a given site at @xmath22 , where the magnetization of all the sub - lattices are parallel to the field .",
    "so , for small angles between the sub - lattices , the order starts to develop like a 120@xmath8 system ( see fig .",
    "[ 120 ] ) but at a given angle , the dipolar field coming from the other chains becomes large enough to flip one of the sub - lattices according to the planar arrangement of csnif@xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ hexaplan ] ) .",
    "the starting point of the theoretical description of such a system is the full three - dimensional ( @xmath23 ) hamiltonian of equation ( [ hamil3d ] ) .",
    "since this hamiltonian , applied to a triangular lattice , involves up to three magnetic sub - lattices , it is a highly non - trivial task to solve it even numerically . on the contrary , the one - dimensional ( @xmath0 ) part of the hamiltonian consisting of first , third and fourth term can be calculated numerically quite easily and with good precision by the tranfer - matrix technique .",
    "the utility of mean - field theory for this problem comes from the fact that the @xmath0 part has a much larger contribution to the free - energy @xmath24 than the @xmath23 one ( @xmath25).@xcite thermal averages of the @xmath0 hamiltonian can be used to approximate the free - energy of the @xmath23 one .",
    "formally , this type of free - energy is obtained using the bogoliubov inequality:@xcite    @xmath26    with the three magnetic sub - lattices of fig .  [ 120 ] , and with a proper counting of each link in the @xmath27 term , this gives the following trial free - energy : @xmath28 the thermal averages @xmath29 are just the magnetisation @xmath19 of the sublattice @xmath30 .",
    "using the angle definition of fig .  [ 120 ] for @xmath31 and defining @xmath32 as the angle between the field and the @xmath13 plane , the trial free - energy can be written as : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the component of @xmath19 in the @xmath13 plane .",
    "it is also important to note that equation  ( [ ftrial ] ) is valid only for small values of the angle @xmath31 where the dipolar field has no influence on the order . minimising ( [ ftrial ] ) with respect to @xmath31 gives @xmath35 or , @xmath36 \\ . \\label{cos1}\\ ] ]    this results is reasonable . at high fields , @xmath37 , indicating the field - induced ferromagnetic ( paramagnetic ) phase . in zero field , and for a sufficiently low temperature , one gets the @xmath38 configuration .",
    "of course , this type of structure is not applicable for csnif@xmath1 but it reflects the ordering mecanism which is valid only for small values of @xmath31 . as indicated above , @xmath22 is defined where @xmath39 and it can be obtained by solving self - consistently the following equation : @xmath40 each side of equation ( [ self ] ) represents a contribution to the free - energy @xmath24 ( to within a minus sign ) .",
    "the right - hand side is the magnetic field contribution @xmath41 , the dominant one in the paramagnetic phase , while the left - hand is the @xmath23 contribution of the ordered phase .",
    "since @xmath19 is bounded to unity , the field contribution will eventually dominate at high field and the phase with the lowest free - energy will be the paramagnetic one .",
    "the strength of the ordered phase is controlled by the parameter @xmath27 . in some systems , like csnif@xmath1 ,",
    "this parameter is not well known but it can be evaluated with this technique by fitting to experimental data .    from the limiting behavior of equation  ( [ self ] ) at low field",
    ", it is also possible to calculate , within mftm , the transition temperature in zero field,@xcite @xmath42 .",
    "this gives : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the @xmath0 susceptibility .",
    "an interesting application of equation  ( [ chi ] ) is the possibility to calculate directly the value of @xmath27 needed for a given @xmath42 . in the presents work",
    ", this is the only procedure used to set @xmath27 .",
    "the last item that needs to be solved in this mean - field theory is the value and the orientation of the external magnetic field @xmath45 .",
    "up to now , the field included in the calculation was the effective field applied to @xmath0 chain .",
    "this is not the true external field ; one needs to add a dipolar contribution @xmath46 and a @xmath23 contribution , @xmath47 , coming from the influence of the neighboring chains . using @xmath48 to designate the field used previously in this paper this gives : @xmath49 equation  ( [ hext ] ) is shown graphically in fig .",
    "[ consth ] .",
    "this figure also shows two new angle definitions between fields and the @xmath13 plane : @xmath50 for @xmath45 and @xmath51 for @xmath47 and @xmath52 .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath47 is straighforward it is just the number of near neighbors times @xmath27 .",
    "it gives : @xmath53 the dipolar field @xmath46 can be evaluated easily , if the magnetization of all the sub - lattices are parallel , since there is no interchain contribution .",
    "for @xmath19 in the plane perpendicular to the chain this gives : @xmath54 with @xmath55 since csnif@xmath1 has a quite strong @xmath13 caracter , the component of @xmath19 in the @xmath13 plane was always by far the greatest for all the angles",
    "@xmath32 used in the calculation so that the numerical constant used in equation  ( [ hdip ] ) was good to a few percent in all cases .",
    "the fields @xmath47 and @xmath46 are important in evaluating the external field @xmath45 but they are not included in the calculation of @xmath22 by equation  ( [ self ] ) .",
    "the first one , @xmath47 , is implicitely accounted for in the left - hand side of equation  ( [ self ] ) while the second one , @xmath46 , obviously turns with @xmath19 so there is no free - energy changes due to it .",
    "the phase transitions are obtained by the solution of equation ( [ self ] ) which implies a prior knowledge of @xmath56 , the @xmath0 magnetization .",
    "an effective and flexible way of calculating @xmath19 is the transfer - matrix technique , which depends on the various @xmath0 parameters like the single - ion anisotropy ( @xmath15 ) and the parallel exchange interaction ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "since the present work relies heavily on the tranfer - matrix technique , a brief summary of this method is presented here .",
    "this study follows the work of blume _",
    "et al._@xcite and assumes that the classical spin hamiltonian for an @xmath58 spins chain of magnitude @xmath59 can be written as : @xmath60 with @xmath61 + { { \\tilde { \\bf h } } \\over 2 } \\cdot ( \\hat s_{i } + \\hat s_{i+1})\\ ] ] and @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65    the unit vectors @xmath66 are oriented along the spin direction . using these definitions , the partition function can be written@xcite as a product of boltzmann factors , @xmath67 \\nonumber \\cr & = & \\sum_{\\{s_i\\ } } \\prod_{i=1}^{n }   \\exp \\bigl [ \\tilde \\beta   v ( \\hat s_i , \\hat s_{i+1 } ) \\bigr ] \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath68 is translationnaly invariant , the term in the product does not depend on the site chosen and @xmath69 is given by : @xmath70 with @xmath71\\ ] ] since @xmath58 is a very large number , only the largest eigenvalue @xmath72 of @xmath73 will contribute significantly to @xmath69 .    for classical spins ,",
    "the transfer - operator @xmath73 needs to be mapped onto some discretisation of the spherical coordinates in order to evaluate it numerically .",
    "following the procedure found in ref .",
    ", which is suitable for broken rotational symmetry , one finds the @xmath0 magnetization to given by : @xmath74 , \\label{mag}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the eigenvector of @xmath73 corresponding to the largest eigenvalue @xmath72 and , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , are respectively the number of coordinates and the legendre weights of the discret spherical coordinates @xmath80 and @xmath81 . in the absence of a magnetic field , or when the field is along the chain axis , a simplification using the rotational invariance of @xmath68 can be used.@xcite the reduced number of coordinates for @xmath73 greatly improves the amount of computing time needed for a given precision .",
    "such a simplification can be used to evaluate the susceptibility @xmath82 of the zero field equation  ( [ chi ] ) .",

    "this second index is implicitely taken into account with the broken rotational symmetry algorithm .",
    "typical matrix sizes are @xmath84 for the broken rotational symmetry algorithm while they are only @xmath85 for the rotational invariance one . in both cases",
    "the amount of computing is not excessive , ranging between seconds and minutes per @xmath86 point .",
    "of course this figure increases rapidly with matrix size .",
    "the main goal of this work is to calculate the magnetic phase diagram of csnif@xmath1 .",
    "figure  [ diagcsnif3 ] presents a comparison between the experimental phase diagram obtained with ultrasound by lussier _",
    "et al_.@xcite and the phase diagram calculated with the mftm method . in this figure ,",
    "the circles are the original experimental data and the squares are from the mftm .",
    "the diamond at zero field is set to 2.77  k by an appropriate choice of @xmath27 according to equation  ( [ chi ] ) .",
    "the value found for @xmath27 using this procedure is 0.0253  k. for this phase diagram and all the subsequent mftm data on csnif@xmath1 it will be the only value of @xmath27 used .",
    "the overall agreement between theory and experiment is good considering the fact that this mean - field theory neglects the @xmath23 fluctuations which are not included in the transfer - matrix calculation and are the relevant ones close to @xmath42 .",
    "it is quite obvious from the development of mftm that @xmath22 scaled as @xmath19 and so @xmath87 .",
    "the absence of the @xmath23 fluctuations thus reflects itself in the critical exponent @xmath88 , giving the usual mean - field value of @xmath89 value for the theoretical phase diagram .",
    "this compares with an experimental estimate@xcite of @xmath90 .",
    "the large @xmath13 single - ion anisotropy in csnif@xmath1 has an important effect on the angular dependence of @xmath22 .",
    "crudely , one can say that when increasing the field for @xmath91 the transition occurs when @xmath19 saturates so that the left side of equation  ( [ self ] ) becomes bounded and the @xmath92 term at the right can dominate .",
    "because of the @xmath13 anisotropy of csnif@xmath1 , @xmath19 will grow rapidly along the projection of @xmath93 in the @xmath13 plane and it will saturate for approximately the same field for small angles of the field out of the plane . for large angles , the projection of @xmath93 in the @xmath13 plane will be small and @xmath19 will grow more slowly giving a larger @xmath22 .",
    "this type angular dependence is shown in fig .",
    "[ xyvsa ] . in this figure , the experimental data of ref .   and",
    "the mftm results are represented respectively by the circles and the diamond .",
    "the agreement , already quite good between these data , becomes excellent when a possible correction for a misalignement of the experimental plane of rotation of 6@xmath8 is included ( circles ) .",
    "this correction , although large , is not unreasonable .",
    "one should also consider the nature of the theoretical method used as a source of error , especially close to @xmath94 , a pathological angle for the present method since the coupling between @xmath95 and @xmath92 then tends to zero . as mentioned earlier , even for the largest angle of the magnetic field out of the @xmath13 plane used , @xmath19 was always out the plane by less than 10@xmath8 so that the numerical constant in equation  ( [ hdip ] ) was valid to a few percent .",
    "the good agreement found in fig .",
    "[ xyvsa ] constrasts sharply with the failure of full @xmath23 mean - field theory , as mentioned in ref .  .",
    "more generally , in the absence of a magnetic field , the paramagnetic phase transitions are determined by the magnetic susceptibility of the system according to equation ( [ chi ] ) .",
    "when a single - ion anisotropy is present , like in the ising and @xmath13 cases , the susceptibility is not isotropic and only the largest component needs to be taken into account . for an ising system it is the longitudinal component @xmath96 while for an @xmath13 one , it is one of the transverse components @xmath97 or @xmath98 .",
    "the equation ( [ chi ] ) is particularily useful since from the knowledge of the susceptibility at a given temperature one can extract the perpendicular exchange interaction @xmath27 needed for a phase transition at this temperature .",
    "such plots , for various values of @xmath99 in a system having @xmath100 and @xmath101 are shown in fig .",
    "[ tcvsjp ] .",
    "one can observe in this figure three limiting cases ; the heisenberg one at high values of @xmath27 , the @xmath13 one at intermediate values and the ising one at low values .",
    "this can be easily understood , the general effect of the single - ion anisotropy is to favor the order by increasing the susceptibility when reducing the degrees of freedom of the spin system .",
    "it is especially true if the anisotropy is of the ising type since the degrees of freedom become discrete .",
    "the @xmath13 anistropy has a similar influence but it is less pronounced , the degrees of freedom being still continuous . of course ,",
    "at high enough temperature @xmath102 the heisenberg behavior is recovered in all cases .",
    "there is a functional difference between the continuous and discrete degrees of freedom . for the continuous ones",
    ", the low @xmath27 behavior is characterised by a power law of the from @xmath103 .",
    "the dotted line , having a 1/2 slope , helps appreciate this . on the contrary",
    ", the discrete one ( ising ) shows a more complex exponential form .",
    "these results are in agreement with the arguments of villain _",
    "et al_.@xcite their result for the ising case is shown by the dashed curve .",
    "the last aspect investigated in this paper is the influence of the amplitude of the @xmath13 single - ion anisotropy on the whole phase diagram .",
    "as seen in the previous paragraph an increase of the anisotropy will enhance the magnetic order as a function of the temperature by increasing the susceptibility . as a function of the magnetic field , for @xmath91",
    ", the anisotropy should have a much smaller effect since it is not implied directly in the phase transition .",
    "figure  [ diagvsd ] shows such phase diagrams for a magnetic field in the @xmath13 plane and for three values of @xmath99 ; 0.1 , 0.2 and 0.5 .",
    "the value of @xmath27 has been set arbitrarily and the same lattice parameters than csnif@xmath1 have been used . in zero field ,",
    "the predicted behavior is observed , the highest @xmath42 being with @xmath104 while the lowest is with @xmath105 . for a constant temperature smaller than @xmath42 ( like @xmath106 )",
    ", one can also observe the small effect of @xmath99 on @xmath22 .",
    "in this work , a method for treating antiferromagnetically coupled ferromagnetic chains by mean - field theory has been developed for a system with a hexagonal lattice .",
    "the solution of the @xmath0 part of the problem has been obtained by a generalised tranfer - matrix algorithm which is suitable for broken rotational symmetry.@xcite although special care has been needed to correctly account for the large dipolar field originating from the ferromagnetic chains , it has been possible to reproduce with succes the phase diagram of csnif@xmath1 by only adjusting the value of @xmath27 .",
    "the peculiar dependence of the critical field of csnif@xmath1 as a function of the angle between the magnetic field and the chain axis has also been reproduced successfully,@xcite in sharp contrast with @xmath23 mean - field theory .",
    "more generally , the dependence of the critical temperature as a function of @xmath27 has been established for various values of the single - ion anisotropy @xmath15 .",
    "for the cases having continuous degrees of freedom , like the @xmath13 and heisenberg ones , a @xmath103 has been found while for the ising case a more complex form has been obtained .",
    "these results are all in agreement with the ones obtained by villain _",
    "et al _ in ref .  .",
    "for the @xmath13 case , the effect of the size of the single - ion anisotropy on the overall shape of the phase diagram have also been investiguated .",
    "the results are in agreement with some simple physical arguments , an increase of @xmath42 with @xmath15 and a rather small effect on @xmath22 for temperatures much lower than @xmath42 .    on the basis of the success of this method for the phase diagram of csnif@xmath1",
    ", some extensions can be considered .",
    "the phase diagram of af - chains compounds with @xmath13 behavior , like csmnbr@xmath1,@xcite could be examined although some complications with the transfer - matrix algorithm , coming from the difference in the effective field of the two staggered sub - lattices , are expected .",
    "since successive phase transitions occur , the present method , based on linear response theory , must be generalized so that the free - energy itself is calculated.@xcite a more challenging prospect is the application of this method to easy - axis af chains systems like csnicl@xmath1.@xcite in this case , the single - ion anisotropy plays an active role in the magnetic ordering so it can not be taken into account only by the transfer - matrix solution of the @xmath0 part of the problem ; it must also be included in the calculation @xmath23 free - energy .",
    "this will add at least an order of magnitude to the complexity of the problem .",
    "financial support from the centre de recherche en physique du solide , the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada and le fonds formation de chercheurs et laide  la recherche du gouvernement du qubec has been essential for this work .",
