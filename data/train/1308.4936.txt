    "space and time scales are the most fundamental parameters in any physical system .",
    "correlations and scaling laws between spatial and temporal parameters reveal the characteristics of various physical transport processes , such as motion in gravitational or electromagnetic fields , random walk processes , diffusion , conduction , turbulence , percolation , branching theory , network systems , etc . here",
    "we focus on transport processes in solar flares , which to the best of our knowledge , are governed by magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) processes and kinetic particle physics in coronal plasmas .",
    "however , kinetic theory and non - ideal mhd involve microscopic processes that exhibit a high level of complexity due to the large number of degrees of freedom , which is difficult or impossible to characterize with macroscopic quantities .    a relatively new method to understand the complexity of nonlinear energy dissipation processes is the concept of _ self - organized criticality ( soc ) _ , pioneered by bak et al .  ( 1987 ; 1988 ) , applied to solar flares by lu and hamilton ( 1991 ) , and reviewed in a number of recent textbooks ( aschwanden 2011 , 2013 ; pruessner 2012 ) .",
    "soc can be considered as a basic physical mechanism , universally occurring in systems with many coupled degrees of freedom in the limit of infinitesimal external forcing .",
    "such nonlinear systems are driven in the vicinity of a critical state , which is maintained by a self - organizing feedback mechanism in a robust manner that does not need any fine - tuning of physical parameters .",
    "the macroscopic evolution of an instability in a soc system , triggered by a random disturbance that exceeds the local threshold of the instability , is governed by nearest - neighbor interactions on a microscopic level , which emerge and evolve over macroscopic scales in spatial volumes that exhibit long - range correlation lengths .",
    "these long - range correlation lengths demarcate zones with coherent deviations from the critical state , and thus indicate that nature self - organizes to the _ vicinity of a critical state _ , rather than being exactly at the edge of a critical state , which can be probed with correlation functions @xmath16 ( jensen 1988 , section 2.4 ) , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a physical observable in a soc system , such as , for instance , the non - potential magnetic field component in the solar corona .",
    "nonlinear energy dissipation events in soc systems , also called _ avalanches _ in soc jargon , thus evolve over macroscopic length scales @xmath0 that show some degree of correlation , such as zones with stressed or twisted magnetic fields ( that are misaligned by some angle to the potential field ) , along which avalanches can propagate and evolve .",
    "the spatial scales of solar flares thus convey information that is equivalent to the correlations length .",
    "the correlation length can reveal macroscopic zones with coherent deviations from criticality and can be used to predict event sizes .",
    "for instance , free energy computed from the non - potential magnetic field near the neutral line is used to forecast flares , coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) , and filament eruptions ( e.g. , schrijver 2007 , falconer et al .",
    "2011 , 2012 ) .",
    "statistics of spatial scales @xmath0 of solar flares , which can be expressed as _ probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) _ or _ occurrence frequency distributions _",
    "@xmath19 , exhibit ubiquitous powerlaw functions that are the hallmark of soc systems . since soc systems evolve into the vicinity of a critical state , where long - range correlation lengths exist ( jensen 1988 , section 2.4 ) , small disturbances can trigger small or large avalanches , which do not depend on any particular physical mechanism , such as , for instance , magnetic reconnection processes that produce solar flares .    in this study",
    "we investigate the universal behavior of spatial and temporal scales in solar flares , which are related to each other in terms of a classical ( or an anomalous ) diffusion process , governed by the statistics of a random walk process ( aschwanden 2012b ) .",
    "we show that the statistical distributions and correlations of spatial and temporal scales in solar flares are independent of other physical parameters .",
    "in contrast , other observables , such as photon fluxes do depend on physical parameters and are not universal for soc processes .",
    "in solar ( and astrophysical ) observations , photon fluxes are observed at various wavelengths , which depend on physical parameters such as the electron temperature , density , or pressure , and thus scaling laws , correlations , and size distributions of observed photon fluxes are wavelength - dependent , and not universal , which will be modeled in paper ii .",
    "the basic theory to interpret our statistical measurements of solar flare parameters is the _ fractal - diffusive avalanche model of slowly - driven self - organized criticality systems ( fd - soc ) _ , described and tested with cellular automaton simulations in aschwanden ( 2012a ) , and applied to solar flares in aschwanden ( 2012b ) .",
    "this theoretical model consists of four components : ( 1 ) scaling laws of euclidean spatial parameters ( in terms of the scale - free probability conjecture , section 2.1 ) ; ( 2 ) the fractal geometry of the internal structure of soc avalanches ( section 2.2 ) ; ( 3 ) the spatio - temporal evolution of soc avalanches ( in terms of fractal - diffusive transport , section 2.3 ) ; and ( 4 ) physical scaling laws between observables and geometric soc parameters ( such as the flux - volume relationship ; paper ii ) .",
    "the first three parts have universal validity in the sense that they can be derived from physics - free , pure mathematical and statistical probabilities , while the fourth component depends on the specific physical mechanism that controls the dynamics of a soc avalanche and thus the observables . in this study",
    "we involve multi - wavelength observations of solar flares , which may exhibit different scaling laws depending on the wavelengths , according to the involved physical mechanism . in this paper",
    "i we analyze spatial and temporal parameters , which can be described by universal scaling laws that govern the first three components of our fd - soc model , while we derive and test the scaling laws that concern the physics - based ( fourth ) component of the fd - soc model in paper ii .      typically , probability distribution functions ( pdf ) like gaussian , binomial , poisson , exponential , or powerlaw functions are adopted to describe likelihoods for counting or flux measurement scenarios .",
    "most probability distributions in _ self - organized criticality ( soc ) _ systems , which produce nonlinear dissipation events ( also called _ avalanches _ ) , exhibit powerlaw functions over some parameter range of length scales and time scales .",
    "our approach to understand the powerlaw nature of soc systems is the so - called _ scale - free probability conjecture _ , which is based purely on a statistical argument , in analogy to gaussian distributions that can be derived from binomial statistics .    in soc models ( bak et al .",
    "1987 ) , which produce avalanches in a multiplicative manner over some time interval of coherent growth , the statistics is fundamentally different from the random additivity of incoherent processes with gaussian statistics .",
    "the classical soc paradigm is a sandpile with a critical slope that is self - adjusting ( or self - organizing ) after each avalanche .",
    "however , the local slopes are not exactly at the critical threshold , but show some small irregular deviations , which are called _ coarse - granularity _ or _ micro - roughness_. these deviations in the vicinity of the critical threshold have spatial long - range correlation lengths that enable chain reactions over large distances once a local instability sets in .",
    "thus , a soc system has the ability to produce avalanches over a large range of sizes @xmath20 , which sometimes exceeds several orders of magnitude .",
    "we argue that the statistical probability distribution function of an avalanche with length scale @xmath0 in any euclidean space with dimension @xmath21 for the euclidean spatial dimension ( aschwanden 2012a ) , but rename it here to @xmath22 , to be more consistent with literature and to avoid confusion with the parameter @xmath20 that is generally used to characterize the size of a soc avalanche ( e.g. , bak et al .",
    "1987 ; pruessner 2012 ) . ]",
    "( @xmath22 ) , is ( aschwanden 2012a ) , @xmath23 which represents a powerlaw distribution function .",
    "this simple statistical probability argument is independent of the physical process that drives a soc avalanche , such as gravity in the case of sandpiles or magnetic reconnection in the case of solar flares , and thus has universal validity for soc systems .",
    "other size distributions of geometric or spatial parameters that can directly be derived from eq .",
    "( 2 ) are the euclidean 2-d avalanche area @xmath1 and the 3-d avalanche volume @xmath2 .",
    "if we simply define the euclidean area @xmath1 in terms of the squared length scale , i.e. , @xmath24 , we obtain the area size distribution @xmath25 by substitution , @xmath26 \\left| { dl \\over da } \\right| da          \\propto a^{-(1+d)/2 } da \\ , \\ ] ] yielding @xmath9 for 3-d phenomena ( @xmath27 .",
    "similarly we define the euclidean volume , i.e. , @xmath28 , which can be substituted to obtain the volume size distribution @xmath29 , @xmath30 \\left| { dl \\over dv } \\right| dv          \\propto v^{-(1 + 2/d ) } dv \\ , \\ ] ] yielding @xmath10 for 3-d phenomena ( @xmath27",
    ".    thus , we have universal predictions for the size distributions of length scales , areas , and volumes of soc avalanches that depend only on the euclidean space dimension @xmath21 , which will be tested in section 3 with multi - wavelength images of solar flares .",
    "the complex topology of a soc avalanche at a given instant of time can be described by a fractal dimension ( bak and chen 1989 ) , for instance with the hausdorff dimension @xmath31 ( in euclidean space dimension @xmath22 ) , @xmath32 an example of several time instances @xmath33 of a soc avalanche with determination of the hausdorff dimension @xmath34 as a function of time is shown in figs .  2 and 3 of aschwanden ( 2012a ) .",
    "the mean value of the minimum @xmath35 and maximum dimension @xmath36 is a good approximation of the average fractal dimension @xmath31 of an avalanche , for each euclidean dimension @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath37 so , we expect an average fractal dimension of @xmath38 for 3-d avalanches .",
    "the third component of the fd - soc model concerns the spatio - temporal evolution of soc avalanches , which can be characterized by the generalized relationship for diffusion ( aschwanden 2012a ) , @xmath39 where @xmath40 represents the evolution of the flare radius @xmath40 , @xmath41 the start time of the diffusion process , @xmath5 is the diffusion coefficient , and @xmath6 is the diffusion ( or spreading ) powerlaw exponent .",
    "the case of @xmath42 corresponds to classical diffusion or random walk , while the regimes of @xmath43 corresponds to sub - diffusion , and @xmath44 to super - diffusion or hyper - diffusion ( also called lvy flights by mandelbrot ) , both representing anomalous diffusion processes .",
    "the lower limit of the diffusion powerlaw exponent @xmath45 can be identified with a logistic growth process ( aschwanden 2012a ) , while the upper limit of @xmath46 corresponds to linear growth .",
    "values of @xmath47 would indicate nonlinear growth characteristics .",
    "the various evolutions are pictured in fig .  1 .",
    "since most instabilities , including soc avalanches , start with an exponential growth phase , and saturate at a maximum level , it is useful to describe the evolutionary time profile with a _ logistic equation_. the combined evolution of a logistic growth phase and and a diffusive saturation phase can be analytically expressed with a smooth transition inbetween ( aschwanden 2012b ; section 2.5 ) , @xmath48^{-1/3 }          & { \\rm for } \\",
    "t \\le t_1 \\\\          \\kappa ( t - t_k)^{\\beta/2 }          & { \\rm for } \\ t >",
    "t_1          \\end{array }          \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath49 represents the final spatial scale of @xmath40 in the case of strict logistic growth ( @xmath45 ) , and @xmath50 respresents the e - folding growth time .",
    "the time evolution @xmath40 is shown in fig .  1 for five different diffusion exponents ( @xmath6=0.0 , 0.5 , 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.0 ) .",
    "we will fit this analytical evolutionary function ( eq .  8) to the flare radius evolution @xmath51 for different wavelengths @xmath52 and flux thresholds @xmath53 in section 3 , in order to obtain statistics on the diffusion coefficients @xmath5 and diffusion exponents @xmath6 .",
    "if the diffusion coefficient @xmath5 is uncorrelated with the flare radius @xmath54 or flare duration @xmath55 , we expect ( according to eq .  7 for @xmath56 $ ] ) a scaling law between the spatial @xmath0 and time scale @xmath4 , @xmath57 which constitutes another universal scaling law , being dictated by the statistical nature of a diffusion process , such as random walk statistics in the case of classical diffusion ( @xmath42 ) .    combining the scale - free probability distribution of length scales , @xmath58 ( eq .",
    "2 ) , with the universal scaling law for time scales , @xmath59 ( eq .  9 ) , we can then directly predict the probability distribution of time scales , @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) \\left| { dl \\over dt } \\right| dt          \\propto t^{-[1+(d-1 ) \\beta /2 ] } \\ dt \\ , \\ ] ] which for 3-d phenomena ( @xmath13 ) predicts a powerlaw slope of @xmath62 .",
    "thus , the powerlaw slope for time durations will be @xmath63 for classical diffusion ( @xmath42 ) , or lay in the range of @xmath64 for sub - diffusion , or in the range of @xmath65 for hyper - diffusion .    in conclusion",
    ", according to the fd - soc model , the probability distributions of space @xmath0 and time scales @xmath4 depend only on the euclidean space dimension @xmath21 and diffusion exponent @xmath6 .",
    "the internal fractal geometry of a soc avalanche is quantified by the fractal dimension @xmath66 and has a universal characteristics also . in contrast , the probability distributions of other observable parameters , such as the flux @xmath67 observed in a given instrumental wavelength @xmath52 , do depend on specific physical mechanisms observed in soc avalanches , which can be quantified in terms of a flux - volume scaling law , @xmath68 , the fourth component of the fd - soc model , which we will explore in paper ii .",
    "the observations and the data analysis method are similar to the previous study of aschwanden ( 2012b ) .",
    "the two major differences to the previous study are that ( i ) we analyze a multi - wavelength data set that includes all seven coronal filters ( 94 , 131 , 171 , 193 , 211 , 304 , 335 ) of aia / sdo ( lemen et al .",
    "2012 ; boerner et al .",
    "2012 ) , compared with the earlier single - wavelength study ( 335 ) , and ( ii ) we are using five relative flux thresholds for the identification of flare areas , while the previous study used only two fixed flux threshold levels .",
    "the main motivation for this extended study is that we want to distinguish universal ( statistical ) from wavelength - dependent ( physical ) scaling laws , as well as to explore possible systematic uncertainties in the flare area definition . in the following subsections we discuss a number of systematic uncertainties ( such as the effects of flux thresholds in the flare area measurments , possible dependencies of flux size distributions on the observed wavelengths , the effects of flux saturation in flare area measurements from overexposed images , effects of coronal dimming , and uncertainties in the definition of flare durations ) .",
    "random errors due to small - number statistics and the corresponding accuracy of powerlaw fits are discussed in section 7.1.7 of aschwanden ( 2011 ) .",
    "we determined also formal errors of powerlaw fits , but do not list them here , because larger uncertainties occur due to the deviations from ideal powerlaws , the choice of the lower cutoffs ( where incomplete sampling applies ) and upper cutoffs ( for the rare largest events ) .",
    "instead we list empirical uncertainties of the powerlaw slopes in terms of the means and standard deviations obtained from averaging the slopes among different wavelengths ( bottom lines in tables 1 - 6 ) and among different flux thresholds ( last columns in tables 1 - 6 ) .",
    "the dataset consists of 155 solar flares that includes all m- and x - class flares detected with aia / sdo during the first two years of the sdo mission ( during the time interval of 2010 may 13 and 2012 march 31 ) .",
    "all aia images have a cadence of @xmath69 s and a pixel size of @xmath70 km , which corresponds to a spatial resolution of @xmath71 km .",
    "we analyzed about 100 time frames for each flare in 7 wavelengths , which amounts to a total number of @xmath72 images or @xmath73 terabytes of aia data .",
    "the data analysis for a single wavelength is described in some detail in section 3.2 of aschwanden ( 2012b ) , where two fixed flux thresholds were used at @xmath74 and @xmath75 dn s@xmath76 .",
    "here we use five different flux thresholds @xmath77 in each of the seven wavelengths , which were set at @xmath78 , and @xmath79 of the peak flux @xmath80 during the flare time interval .",
    "the use of multiple thresholds yields more robust normalized flare areas , because fuzzy fine structures of the flare boundaries are better averaged out at different flux levels ( see section 3.2 and figure 3a ) .",
    "two flare area definitions are used : ( i ) the instantaneous flare area @xmath81 that entails all pixels with a flux above the flux threshold at time @xmath33 , and ( ii ) the time - integrated flare area @xmath82 that combines pixels that had a flux exceeding the threshold anytime during the flare time interval @xmath83 $ ] .",
    "we will see that the instantaneous flare area @xmath84 has a fractal characteristics , while the time - integrated flare area @xmath1 has a near euclidean , space - filling topology .",
    "defining an equivalent circular area , we can then characterize a length scale @xmath85 that corresponds to the radius of this circular area , @xmath86    an example of the analysis of one flare event ( # 28 ) in one single filter ( 193 ) is shown in fig .  2 , showing the flux profiles @xmath87 and flare radius profiles @xmath88 for the 5 different thresholds .",
    "this figure can be compared with fig .  2 in aschwanden ( 2012b ) , where the same event is analyzed in a different wavelength ( 335 ) with two different thresholds .",
    "the 193  images shown in fig .",
    "2 exhibit also episodes of flux saturation due to too long exposure times , which however , are adjusted in subsequent images with the automated exposure control mechanism of aia .",
    "the flux saturation can lead to significant underestimates of the peak flux ( measured in a single pixel ) , but the missing flux in saturated flare areas represents a small fraction of the total image - integrated euv flux and inferred flare area here , as the continuity of the total flux profiles @xmath87 and flare radius profiles @xmath88 show in fig",
    "the 7 temperature filters of aia are sensitive to coronal plasma in the temperature range of @xmath89 ( boerner et al .",
    "we will describe the thermal response functions of these wavelength filters in paper ii , where we perform a differential emission measure ( dem ) analysis and determine wavelength - independent physical parameters , such as electron densities and electron temperatures .",
    "since we measure the length scale @xmath90 from the flare area @xmath91 at five different flux threshold levels @xmath92 of the maximum flux @xmath80 , we obtain flare areas and length scales of different sizes @xmath90 , where the lowest flux threshold level of @xmath93 encompasses the largest flare areas , while the highest flux threshold level of @xmath94 encloses the smallest flare areas , among the different threshold levels . in order to eliminate this dependence of the length scale on the flux threshold ,",
    "we normalize all flare areas to a fixed threshold level of @xmath95 .",
    "we find empirically the following relationship between the length scales @xmath96 measured at a threshold level @xmath53 and a normalized length scale @xmath97 defined at a fixed threshold level of @xmath95 ( fig .  3 , top panel ) ,",
    "@xmath98 this relationship works equally well for all 7 wavelengths , as demonstrated with the scatterplot shown in fig .",
    "3 ( bottom panel ) between the measured length scales @xmath99 and the normalized length scales @xmath100 .",
    "this relationship quantifies that the ratio @xmath101 of the measured length scales are factors of 1.85 , 1.42 , 1.00 , 0.77 , and 0.59 different at the various thresholds @xmath102 0.01 , 0.02 , 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.2 with respect to a chosen fixed threshold of @xmath95 .",
    "these scale factors can be seen in the vertical scale of the fitted flare expansion curves @xmath85 in the example shown in fig .  2 ( middle panel ) .",
    "the normalized flare areas synthesized from five different thresholds average the fuzzy contours of flare areas better than the area obtained from a single arbitrary flux threshold .",
    "we apply this threshold normalization ( eq .",
    "12 ) to all parameters that are derived from a measured length scale @xmath0 , such as to the flare area @xmath1 , the flare volume @xmath2 , the diffusion coefficient @xmath5 , and the maximum velocity @xmath7 .    in principle",
    ", the normalization of length scales represents a multi - variate problem , but the excellent correlation of the length scale with the flux threshold ( eq .",
    "12 and fig .  3 , top panel ) justifies a simplified bivariate treatment .",
    "the flare area @xmath1 is the most directly measured quantity among the geometric parameters , while the length scale @xmath0 and volume @xmath2 are deduced from the area @xmath1 . from the 155 flares we derived a flare area @xmath103 at the end time @xmath104 of each flare , for each of the 7 wavelengths @xmath52 and 5 flux thresholds @xmath53 .",
    "the end time @xmath104 of a flare is defined ( according to noaa flare catalogs ) when the goes 1 - 8  flux decays to the half value of the ( preflare background - subtracted ) peak flux ( marked with a vertical dashed line near the right border of the panels shown in fig .  2 ) . histogramming the observed flare areas @xmath1 , we find flare areas between @xmath105 mm@xmath106 and @xmath107 mm@xmath106 .",
    "all powerlaw fits in 7 wavelengths @xmath52 and 5 thresholds @xmath53 are shown separately in fig .",
    "since the log - log histograms of flare areas extend over about two decades for each subset , the powerlaw slopes can be determined somewhat more accurately ( @xmath108 ) than for length scales .",
    "the values for each wavelength and threshold are listed in table 2 .",
    "the overall average is , where the error bar represents the standard deviation from averaging the area parameter from different wavelengths and flux thresholds ( see table 2 ) , @xmath109 which also agrees with the predicted value @xmath110 for soc phenomena in 3-d space ( eq .  ( 3 ) ; for d=3 ) .",
    "similarly as for length scales , we find for flare areas no wavelength dependence ( figs .",
    "5b and 6b ) .",
    "there is only a very slight trend that the flare area depends on the flux threshold ( fig .",
    "7b and table 2 ) .    inspecting the wavelength dependence of the powerlaw distributions in detail ( fig .  4 ) , we do find the largest deviations from predicted powerlaws for the wavelengths of 171 and 193  at low threshold levels of @xmath111 .",
    "watching the flare movies it is obvious that the euv dimming caused by coronal mass ejections is best visible in the 171 and 193  channels , because they are most sensitive to the bulk of the ejected plasma at an electron temperature of @xmath112 mk plasma .",
    "the ejected plasma causes a dimming in the euv flux ( due to the proportionality between coronal mass column depth and optically thin emission ) in such a way that the bright flare area is substantially reduced and underestimated , compared with the other unimpeded wavelengths .",
    "thus , it is recommendable to exclude those two euv filters for this type of statistical studies of spatio - temporal flare parameters .",
    "inquiring the standard deviations for each wavelength range in table 2 , we find that the wavelengths of 94 , 131 , 304 , and 335  have the smallest variation of the powerlaw slope @xmath113 averaged over different flux thresholds , and thus are all equally suitable for statistical studies .    foreshortening effects as a function of the center - to - limb distance could introduce a cosine - dependence if the flare volumes would be 2-dimensional ( as seen in h-@xmath114 or white light ) , but observational measurements in euv and soft x - rays , and volume models in terms of flare loop arcades , yield a much weaker effect that is probably not measurable due to random variations of the flare area geometry , orientation , and filling factors ( aschwanden and aschwanden 2008a , b ) .",
    "we histogrammed the length scales @xmath90 ( derived from the flare area @xmath115 according to eq .",
    "( 11 ) ) and fitted a powerlaw function in the upper half of the logarithmic size range ( similarly as shown for flare areas in fig .  4 ) .",
    "the range of length scales extends from @xmath116 mm to @xmath117 mm for different wavelengths ( normalized to a common flux threshold of @xmath95 ) , so it does cover slightly more than one logarithmic decade .",
    "since the lower half of this logarithmic length distribution shows a rollover due to undersampling of length scales near the flux threshold ( of m1 goes class flares ) in the selection of events , we can fit only a range of length scales that extends over about a half decade , leading to uncertainties of @xmath118 in the determination of the powerlaw slope .",
    "we tabulate the obtained powerlaw slopes @xmath119 of length scales in table 1 , and average them in each wavelength and flux threshold separtately .",
    "the overall average and standard deviation of all @xmath120 powerlaw fits is ( see also table 1 ) , @xmath121 which agrees well with the predicted value @xmath122 for soc phenomena in 3-d space ( eq.(2 ) ; for d=3 ) .",
    "another important result is that we see no dependence on the wavelength , as the powerlaw fits of the size distributions in fig .",
    "5a show , or the powerlaw slopes @xmath119 as a function of the wavelength @xmath52 shown in fig .",
    "6a , and listed in table 1 , which supports our assumption of universality for the length scale distribution @xmath19 .",
    "however , there is a slight trend that the powerlaw slope flattens with increasing flux threshold , from @xmath123 at the 1% threshold level to @xmath124 at the 20% threshold level ( fig .",
    "7a and table 1 ) .",
    "obviously , the low 1% threshold includes more small - scale fluctuations in the time - integrated flare area than a threshold of 20% .",
    "thirdly , we histogram the inferred flare volumes @xmath2 , using the euclidean definition for a hemisphere with radius @xmath0 , @xmath125 which ranges from @xmath126 mm@xmath127 to @xmath128 mm@xmath127 .",
    "the histograms of flare volumes extend over about three orders of magnitude and thus yield a smaller absolute error in the powerlaw slope ( @xmath129 ) than the distribution of length scales and flare areas .",
    "the powerlaw fits are shown separately for each wavelength in fig .  5c , and the powerlaw slopes are tabulated and averaged in table 3 .",
    "the overall average and standard ceviation is , @xmath130 which also agrees with the predicted value @xmath131 for soc phenomena in 3-d space ( eq .  ( 4 ) ; for d=3 ) . also here",
    "we find no significant dependence of the powerlaw slope on the wavelength ( fig .",
    "6c , table 3 ) or flux threshold ( fig .  7c , table 3 ) .",
    "thus , the size distribution of volumes does not depend on the flux threshold or observed wavelength .      for the duration of the 155 analyzed flare events we use the rise time @xmath132",
    "of goes flares ( fig .  1 , top ) , which reflects the impulsive phase of the flare without the arbitrarily long cooling times in the decay phase of the flare .",
    "for the same reason , the duration of energy release can not easily be determined from euv data , because the bulk of euv emission originates late in the postflare phase when the flare plasma cools down to euv temperatures . the energy release time or impulsive phase of a flare",
    "can be best defined by the duration of nonthermal hard x - ray emission @xmath133 ( fig .  1 , top ) . using the neupert effect , which states that the hard x - rays approximately follow the time derivative of the soft x - rays ( as measured by goes ) , the peak time @xmath134 of the goes light curve approximately signals the end of the nonthermal hard x - rays ( fig",
    ".  1 top ) , which justifies that we use the rise time of the soft x - rays as a measure of the energy release time or nonthermal flare duration @xmath4 .",
    "since the definition of an event duration is most critical for systematic errors and uncertainties of the powerlaw distribution of event durations , we emphasize that the nonthermal flare duration ( ignoring the thermal cooling phase ) is most consistent with the duration of energy release avalanches in self - organized criticality systems .",
    "the official definition of the flare duration used in the noaa flare detection algorithm is : the event starts when 4 consecutive 1-minute x - ray values have met all three of the following conditions : ( i ) all 4 values are above the b1 threshold ; ( ii ) all 4 values are strictly increasing ; ( iii ) the last value is greater than 1.4 times the value that occurred 3 minutes earlier .",
    "the peak time is when the flux value reaches the next local maximum .",
    "the event ends when the current flux reading returns to half of the peak value ( http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/stp/solar/solarflares.html ) .",
    "the flare occurrence frequency distribution @xmath60 of goes flare durations @xmath4 is shown in fig .  5d , which exhibits an approximate powerlaw slope of @xmath135 where we determined a mean and standard deviation from using 10 different trials of histogram binning .",

    "2002 ; yashiro et al .",
    "2006 ) , we have 20 independently measured datasets with a mean powerlaw slope of @xmath187 , which is consistent with the theoretical prediction @xmath136 .",
    "these time scale distributions @xmath188 have been measured from photons with different emission mechanisms , such as nonthermal bremsstrahlung at hard x - ray energies of @xmath189 kev , or thermal line emission in soft x - rays ( @xmath190 ) and euv wavelengths ( @xmath191 ) .",
    "the fact that we measure the same powerlaw slope for different physical emission mechanisms , which is moreover consistent with the probability distribution @xmath11 predicted by the fd - soc model , strongly supports the interpretation that the time scale distribution has universal validity also , depending only on the euclidean dimension ( @xmath13 ) of the length scale distribution @xmath58 and on the random walk statistics @xmath192 that defines the spatio - temporal transport process .",
    "solar flares do not occur uniformly distributed over the entire solar surface , but are generated in active regions only , where strong magnetic fields emerge , generated by the internal solar dynamo .",
    "every active region thus represents a finite - size soc system , limiting also the maximum size of solar flares . in our measured distribution of flare length scales",
    "@xmath0 , defined from the radius of a circular area that is equivalent to the observed flare area @xmath193 , we find a range of approximately @xmath194 mm ( figs .",
    "5a and 9 ) , which corresponds to diameters in the range of @xmath195 mm for circular flare areas .",
    "if the flare area is highly elongated , the major axis can be factor of @xmath196 longer than the minor axis .",
    "one of the largest observed flares is the bastille - day flare , which has an arcade length of @xmath197 mm and a width of @xmath198 mm ( aschwanden and alexander 2001 ) , which indeed has an elongation factor of @xmath199 .",
    "the largest flare we observed in our selection has a diameter of @xmath200 mm , which amounts to about a quarter of the solar radius , corresponding to the largest active regions seen on the sun ( e.g. , tang et al .  1984 ) .",
    "thus , the size of flares can occupy almost entire active regions , and consequently we would expect finite - size effects that limit the upper boundary of the size distribution , and potentially could produce a bump at the upper cutoff of the size distribution ( e.g. , as it happens for auroral blobs ; lui et al .",
    "such an effect is not evident in our data ( fig .",
    "5a ) and has not been reported somewhere else , which suggests that there is no significant number of giant flares that reach the full size of active regions . moreover",
    ", the largest flares occur in active regions of different sizes , which smears out the upper cutoffs in the combined size distributions of flares .",
    "this is an important detail that effects the forecasting of the most extreme ( space weather ) events .",
    "although the size distribution of flare durations can be considered as universal , there is a non - universal effect that is caused by the solar cycle , which controls the variation of the flare rate over several orders of magnitude , from the minimum to the maximum of the solar magnetic 11-year cycle .",
    "this effect was most clearly measured in a large sample of over 300,000 solar flares detected with goes during the last 37 years ( aschwanden and freeland 2012 ) .",
    "the flare rate during the solar maximum increases to a level that does not warrant the separation of time scales anymore , i.e. , the waiting times ( i.e. , the time intervals between subsequent flares ) are not anylonger much larger than the flare durations , and thus subsequent flare events start to pile - up , which leads to an under - estimate of the true duration of large flares ( since the previous flare has to end before the next flare starts in most automated flare detection algorithms ) .",
    "a consequence of such a fast - driven system is a steepening of the size distribution of flare durations during times of high flare rates .",
    "the study of aschwanden and freeland ( 2012 ) has demonstrated that the powerlaw slope of flare durations amounts to a lowest value of @xmath137 in years the near solar minimum , close to the theoretical expectation of @xmath136 , but to a much steeper value during solar maxima , approaching values as high as @xmath201 during the most flare - active years .",
    "nevertheless , this is mostly a technical detection problem and could in principle be eliminated if the true flare duration would be measured during times of high flare rates by modeling the time profiles in the decay phase beyond the overlap with the next flare .",
    "so , it is a measurement problem only , rather than a non - universal property of the size distribution of event durations in solar flares .      investigating the measured flare area size distributions @xmath25 in 7 different wavelengths and in 5 different flux thresholds ( figs .  4 , 6b , 7b ) , as well as the powerlaw slopes listed in tables 1 , 2 , and 3 for lengths @xmath0 , areas @xmath1 , and volumes @xmath2 , it becomes apparent that the largest deviations from the averages occur in the wavelengths of 171 and 193 , especially at the lowest flux thresholds of @xmath93 and 0.02 .",
    "inspecting the flare movies in those wavelengths it becomes clear that these wavelengths show most prominently the euv dimming that is caused after the `` evacuation '' of a coronal mass ejection ( cme ) , leading to an underestimate of the flare - related euv emission . since up to 84% of cmes exhibit euv dimming ( bewsher et al .",
    "2008 ) , this is quite common , and shows up as a double - peaked size distribution of flare areas in the wavelengths of 171 and 193  ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "this is an additional non - universal effect that is idiosyncratic to solar flares associated with cmes .",
    "an analogy to bak s sandpile paradigm of soc systems would be huge sand avalanches that cause an additional dust storm which occults part of the avalanche , and thus would affect the accuracy in the measurement of sand avalanche sizes . in order to obtain accurate size distributions of solar flares , we thus recommend to avoid the 171 and 193 wavelengths , at least not for large eruptive flares , where the percentage of cmes and euv dimming is highest ( andrews 2003 ; yashiro et al .",
    "2005 ; wang and zhang 2007 ; cheng et al .",
    "2010 ) .      the spatio - temporal relationship @xmath202 ( eq .  7 ) is quantified by a generalized diffusion process in our fd - soc framework .",
    "interestingly , the diffusion coefficients @xmath5 and diffusion ( or spreading ) exponents @xmath6 appear not to be constant for the analyzed sample of large flares , but show a rather large variation from sub - diffusion to classical diffusion ( statistical random walk ) , while a few events are even in the hyper - diffusive regime . in order to gain more physical insight into this behavior , we consulted a flare classification catalog of the same 155 analyzed events that was established by zhang and liu ( 2012 ) . in this catalog ,",
    "goes m- and x - class flares , analyzed from sdo , soho , and stereo data , were classified based on their association with cmes , or lack of cmes , into eruptive versus confined flares .",
    "an eruptive flare is defined strictly as a flare associated with a coronal mass ejection ( cme ) seen in coronagraph images , while a confined flare exhibits no noticable cme .",
    "the verification of the flare type is carried out straightforwardly through direct comparison with concurrent coronagraph images , and coronal euv images as well . for each of the major sdo flares , the soho / lasco images were carefully checked for a possible association with a cme , and potential disk signatures",
    "were also checked in aia / sdo images , including flare brightenings , euv dimming , and post - eruption arcades . in some cases ,",
    "when necessary , stereo / cor2 coronagraph images and euvi coronal images were checked in addition for further verification .",
    "therefore , the classification of flares into eruptive and confined types is believed to be unambiguous .",
    "previous studies have shown that about 90% of x - class flares and about 50% of m - class flares are associated with cmes ; in other words , 10% of x - class flares and 50% of m - class flares are confined ( andrews 2003 ; yashiro et al .",
    "2005 ; wang and zhang 2007 ; cheng et al .",
    "2010 ) . from the 155 events analyzed in this study",
    ", we have an overlap of 125 events with the catalog of zhang and liu ( 2012 ) , for which we find 59 eruptive ( 47% ) and 66 confined ( 53% ) flare events .    in fig .",
    "11 we show histograms of the various measured parameters @xmath203 , @xmath204 at a wavelength of 335 , separated into the two groups of eruptive flares ( fig .",
    "11 , white histograms ) and confined flares ( fig .  11 , grey histograms ) .",
    "interestingly , we find significant differences in the parameter distributions for flare volumes @xmath2 , goes durations @xmath205 , euv fluxes @xmath206 , and in the diffusion coefficient @xmath5 .",
    "eruptive flares have larger volumes @xmath2 , longer soft x - ray durations @xmath205 , larger euv fluxes @xmath206 , and somewhat larger diffusion coefficients @xmath5 .",
    "the differences between eruptive and confined flares are very similar in all 7 analyzed wavelengths ( fig .",
    "11 shows only one of them , i.e. , 335 ) .",
    "some of these differences are expected according to some theoretical cme models .",
    "for instance , eruptive events are expected to have a more expansive dynamics , and thus a larger diffusion coefficient than the confined ones , which are more stationary flare events , occurring within a closed - field magnetic configuration .",
    "eruptive events seem also to release more magnetic energy than confined flares , leading to statistically larger volumes @xmath2 and fluxes ( @xmath207 ) .",
    "we described the results of the spatio - temporal relationships in section 3.7 and showed the correlations among different parameters in fig .",
    ". the most remarkable correlation , which gives us the best hint of a hidden scaling law is the almost linear relationship @xmath208 ( eq .  18 ) between length scales @xmath0 and diffusion coefficients @xmath5 ( fig .  8 , panel a ) . the uncertainty in the linear regression coefficient amounts to only @xmath209 .",
    "including also a possible dependence on the time duration @xmath4 , which is expected from random - walk transport processes , we find an equally tight three - parameter correlation @xmath210 ( fig .",
    "9 ) . since the spatio - temporal evolution fits @xmath211 ( e.g. , fig .  2 , middle panel )",
    "are most consistent with a constant diffusion coefficient per flare event and subdiffusive spreading exponents of @xmath146 ( table 5 ) , the statistical correlation among many flare events is dominated by the diffusion coefficient @xmath5 rather than by the spreading exponent @xmath6 . therefore , flare events that have a small diffusion coefficient @xmath5 expand to relatively small spatial scales @xmath0 , while other events with large local diffusion coefficients @xmath5 produce the largest flare sizes .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath5 is therefore the most critical and most controlling parameter of the flare size @xmath0 .    in soc systems",
    ", a critical threshold determines whether a nonlinear dissipation event starts or not , while the size of a soc avalanche is mostly controlled by the spatio - temporal correlation characteristics ( eq .  1 ) of the soc system .",
    "locations with long - range correlation lengths produce predictably larger soc avalanches .",
    "long - range correlations become important when significant deviations from the critical threshold extend over a larger spatial area or volume .",
    "this is another way of saying that a soc system self - organizes to the _ vicinity of a critical state _ , rather than being exactly at the critical threshold .",
    "we illustrate this behavior with the sandpile analogy in fig .  12 ( left ) .",
    "the slope of a critical sandpile shows coarse - graininess and significant deviations from the critical slope , especially in places that have been eroded from previous large avalanches , which can be quantified by a cross - correlation function @xmath212 that exhibits significant long - range correlation lengths in extended deviant locations ( fig .  12 , left ) .",
    "subsequent avalanches triggered in those deviant sub - critical locations may evolve predictably into relatively large soc avalanches .",
    "in the situation of solar flares , the non - potential magnetic field component @xmath213 plays the same critical role as the repose angle or slope of the sandpile .",
    "extended locations with coherent non - potential fields ( fig .",
    "12 , right ) exhibit long - range correlation lengths and are more likely to product larger avalanches subsequently .",
    "observations have shown that the length of the neutral line segment with highly sheared and stressed magnetic fields is a good predictor of flares ( e.g. , schrijver 2007 , falconer et al .",
    "2011 , 2012 ) .",
    "the curl of the non - potential field corresponds to the electric current density @xmath214 that drives the dissipation of magnetic energy during flares , once it exceeds a critical threshold @xmath215 ( e.g. , vassiliadis et al .",
    "1998 ; isliker et al .  1998a , 2000 , 2001 ; galsgaard 1996 ; morales and charbonneau 2008a , b , 2009 ) .",
    "it is therefore important to develop reliable _ nonlinear force - free magnetic field ( nlfff ) _ models that measure the spatial and temporal distribution of the current density @xmath216 in active regions , which map out long - range correlation lengths that are susceptible to areas where large flares are most likely to occur , a task that is at the heart of forecasting centers that aim to predict large and extreme ( space weather ) events .",
    "soc systems may provide in this way not only statistical overall probabilities of events , but also probabilities for sizes and start times of individual single events . in order to achieve this ,",
    "future studies should focus on characterizing relationships between current distributions @xmath217 derived from nlfff models and the diffusion ( or spreading ) exponent @xmath5 that can be measured by fitting the generalized diffusion equation @xmath218 ( eq .  7 ) as performed in this study .",
    "in this study we analyzed the spatio - temporal evolution of a statistically complete data set ( of goes m- and x - class flares observed with aia / sdo during the first two years of the mission ) , from which we measure geometric parameters ( lengths , areas , volumes , fractal area dimensions ) , temporal parameters ( flare durations ) , and spatio - temporal parameters ( diffusion coefficient , diffusion or spreading powerlaw exponent , maximum diffusion velocity ) . in this study",
    "we expanded a previous single - wavelength ( 335 ) study ( aschwanden 2012b ) to the entire range of 7 coronal wavelengths of aia ( 94 , 131 , 171 , 193 , 211 , 304 , 335 ) , and generalize the flare area definition by including 5 different flux threshold levels .",
    "in addition we make use of a flare catalog that provides a classification into eruptive and confined flares ( zhang and liu 2012 ) .",
    "the statistical distributions obtained in this study are compared with the predictions from the theory of the fractal - diffusive avalanche model of a slowly - driven self - organized criticality system ( aschwanden 2012a ) .",
    "the major conclusions of this statistical study are :    1 .",
    "the spatio - temporal evolution of flares can be satisfactorily fitted in all events and in all coronal wavelengths with the generalized diffusion model , which includes an initial acceleration phase with exponential growth , followed by a deceleration phase with diffusive random - walk characteristics @xmath218 .",
    "we find a mean diffusion coefficient of @xmath219 mm s@xmath220 and a mean diffusion ( or spreading ) exponent of @xmath146 , which is in the sub - diffusive regime ( likely to be caused by the anisotropy of the magnetic field in the flare regions ) .",
    "the strongest correlation among spatio - temporal parameters is found between the flare length scale @xmath0 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath208 , which combined with the weaker correlation with time scales @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath150 , being consistent with classical random walk diffusion , leads to the 3-parameter scaling law @xmath221 .",
    "we interpret the strong correlation between flare size @xmath0 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath5 in terms of long - range correlation lengths in the vicinity of a self - organized criticality state , predicting a physical relationship between the local diffusion coefficient @xmath5 and the non - potential magnetic field component @xmath213 , which can be used for forecasting of flare sizes @xmath0 by analyzing the pre - flare non - potential magnetic field .",
    "3 .   the observed size distributions of geometric ( @xmath222 ) and temporal parameters ( @xmath4 ) are consistent with the theoretical predictions of the fd - soc model , i.e. , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath223 for a euclidean dimension of @xmath13 , and thus confirm the scale - free probability conjecture and the fractal random walk diffusivity assumption of the fd - soc model . while this agreement of the powerlaw slopes between observations and theoretical predictions has been shown in one single wavelength earlier ( aschwanden 2012b )",

    "however , we do not find any evidence for finite - size effects of soc systems that would modify the upper cutoff of the powerlaw - like size distributions .",
    "non - universal effects that affect the size distribution of solar flares are found to result from cmes and the associated euv dimming , which leads to underestimates of the euv flux in wavelengths of 171 and 193 , producing a double - peaked size distribution .",
    "also the solar cycle can affect the powerlaw slope of measured size distributions of flare durations @xmath4 , which are systematically underestimated due to flare pile - up during episodes of high flaring rates , as they occur during the solar maximum ( aschwanden and freeland 2012 ) .",
    "eruptive flares ( associated with a cme ) have larger volumes @xmath2 , longer soft x - ray durations @xmath205 , larger euv fluxes @xmath206 , and somewhat larger diffusion coefficients @xmath5 than confined flares ( without accompanying cme ) .",
    "eruptive events seem to release more magnetic energy than confined flares , leading to statistically larger volumes @xmath2 and fluxes ( @xmath207 ) .",
    "the major satisfaction of these results is our increasing understanding of the universality of self - organized criticality systems .",
    "we understand now the perplexing question why we observe powerlaw distributions in nature in the first place , in contrast to gaussian distributions .",
    "gaussian or exponential distributions indicate incoherent processes that can not explain extreme ( `` king - dragon '' or `` black - swan '' ) events in the `` fat tail '' of probability distribution functions , while powerlaw distributions are naturally obtained from the scale - free probability conjecture ( eq .",
    "2 ) , which occur due to the coherent nature of multiplicative chain reactions , requiring long - range correlation lengths ( eq .",
    "1 ) in the vicinity of a self - critical state . a logical next step is the study of relationships between long - range correlation of soc - critical parameters , such as the nonpotential magnetic field @xmath225 in solar flaring regions , and the magnitude or size @xmath0 of occurring solar flares , which is found to be directly proportional to the diffusion spreading exponent @xmath5 .",
    "besides the universality of scaling laws for space and time parameters in soc systems , there are also non - universal scaling laws that depend directly on the relationship between observables ( such as fluxes in different wavelengths ) and the geometric avalanche ( or flare ) volume , which will be pursued in paper ii . in future studies",
    ", the statistics of flare events should be extended from the giant flares analyzed here , to the smaller microflares and nanoflares , in order to improve the accuracy of the measured powerlaw slopes ( over several decades ) and to test over what maximum range of parameter space the same physical scaling laws are valid .",
