    "classical novae are potential sources of @xmath1na  which beta decays ( @xmath7 = 3.75  years ) towards the first excited state of @xmath1ne  followed by a prompt gamma ray emission ( @xmath8=1.275  mev ) that could be observed@xcite .",
    "even though it has not been detected yet@xcite , this could happen with higher sensitivity instruments on board of future space missions like integral ( including a ge based gamma ",

    "the accreted h  rich matter enriched with",
    "the c  o or o  ne matter from the white dwarf undergo a thermonuclear runaway that synthesizes new isotopes .",
    "the formation of @xmath1na  ( in o  ne novae ) proceeds from initial @xmath10ne present in large quantities through the two possible paths : @xmath10ne(p,@xmath11na(@xmath12ne(p,@xmath3na and @xmath10ne(p,@xmath11na(p,@xmath3mg(@xmath13na .",
    "the first path has been found@xcite to be more favorable to @xmath1naformation because of its longer time scale .",
    "the preferred path is governed by the competition between the @xmath2na @xmath14decay and the @xmath2na(p,@xmath3 mg  reaction whose rate remains uncertain mainly because of the unknown resonance strength associated with the @xmath4 = 5.714 , @xmath5 = 2@xmath6 , @xmath1 mg  level@xcite .",
    "estimates of the @xmath2na(p,@xmath3 mg reaction rate@xcite have been provided@xcite , considering the first three levels@xcite ( @xmath15 = 5.714 ; 2@xmath6 , 5.837 ; ( 05 ) and 5.965  mev ; 0@xmath6 ) above the proton threshold ( 5.501  mev ) . with the exception of the first level ,",
    "the total widths can be identified with the proton widths , so that @xmath16 .",
    "the resonance strength associated with the first @xmath4=5.714  mev , @xmath5=2@xmath6 level suffers from a significant uncertainty that affects the @xmath2na(p,@xmath3 mg  rate in the temperature domain of nova nucleosynthesis@xcite . for this level",
    ", only the total width is known experimentally ( @xmath17=16.5@xmath184.4  mev@xcite ) and to calculate the corresponding resonance strength , estimated proton widths@xcite have been used together with the relation @xmath17 = @xmath19 + @xmath20 .",
    "the two estimates ( @xmath21 and @xmath22@xcite or @xmath23 and @xmath24@xcite ) lead to similar values ( @xmath0= 3.4 or 3.8  mev ) very close to the maximum value ( @xmath17/4 ) , obtained when @xmath20 = @xmath19 = @xmath17/2 . however , based on the data available for the @xmath1ne  @xmath4=6.120  mev analog level@xcite , it was argued@xcite that the proton width could be much smaller because _",
    "i ) _ the radiative width estimated from the analog level is such that @xmath25 and _ ii ) _ the neutron spectroscopic factor in the analog level should be very small according to experimental data@xcite .",
    "accordingly , values of @xmath26 = 2.5 , 0.25 , 0.0  mev have been adopted for upper ( @xmath20 = @xmath19 = @xmath17/2 ) , recommended ( with the usual 0.1 reduction factor ) and lower limit for the calculation of @xmath1naproduction in novae@xcite .",
    "this induces a factor of 10@xmath27 uncertainty on the rate around a temperature of @xmath28  k , typical of novae , and a factor of up to 3 in the @xmath1nayields@xcite .",
    "another , much less important , source of uncertainty@xcite comes from the assumed value@xcite for the radiative width of the third ( @xmath15 = 5.965  mev ; 0@xmath6 ) level .",
    "it is important to reduce this uncertainty on the @xmath1na  yield that directly affects the detectability distance of the 1.275  mev gamma emission in order to interpret future nova observations . in consequence ,",
    "we performed shell model calculations of spectroscopic factors and radiative strengths for @xmath1ne  and @xmath1 mg  nuclei . in this paper , we first compare calculated values with existing experimental spectroscopic data in order to validate the calculations .",
    "we re  analyze existing experimental data to extract supplementary information on missing spectroscopic factors . from this analysis , we derive better estimates for the spectroscopic factor of the 5.714 ; 2@xmath6 level and the radiative width of the 5.965  mev ; 0@xmath6 level .",
    "finally , we discuss the influence of these new values on the @xmath2na(p,@xmath3 mg  rate and @xmath1na  production in novae .",
    "in order to estimate spectroscopic factors and radiative widths , we have performed shell model calculations using the oxbash code  @xcite . since we are interested only in positive parity states , we used the well - known usd interaction of wildenthal  @xcite for the @xmath29 shell model space .",
    "the results of the calculations in comparison with the experimental spectra of @xmath1ne and @xmath1 mg are shown in figs .",

    "the agreement between calculated and experimental values is very good except for the levels labeled ( in ref.@xcite ) 6.120 , 6.350 ; 6@xmath6 ( no experimentally determined spectroscopic factors ) and 7.341 ; 0@xmath6 .",
    "however , these discrepancies can be explained when new spectroscopic data@xcite are included ( see the following section ) .    assuming the equality between spectroscopic factor of conjugate reactions and according to the good agreement between our calculations and experiment we can confidently use them to obtain the @xmath1 mg  proton width of the @xmath15 = 5.714 ; 2@xmath6 level .",
    "the fourth calculated @xmath30 state at 6.179  mev corresponds to the fourth @xmath30 state of @xmath1ne at 6.120  mev and to the @xmath30 state of @xmath1 mg at 5.714  mev ( fig .",
    "[ f : levels ] ) which are of main interest here . to check the correctness of the assignment and the proximity of the calculated and physical @xmath30 state",
    ", we compared calculated radiative strength with those available experimentally@xcite for the @xmath4=6.120  mev level in @xmath1ne .",
    "there is a fair agreement between the experimental and theoretical values as shown in table  [ t : gamma ] increasing the confidence in the assignment .",
    "the calculated spectroscopic factors for the 2@xmath6 state are small as expected from experiments on @xmath1ne  ( see table  [ t : spect ] ) .",
    "the corresponding proton reduced widths are obtained , using the relation @xmath31 where the single - particle width @xmath32 has been estimated from the scattering phase shifts in the woods - saxon potential with the depth required to reproduce the experimentally known energy of the resonance . the contribution of @xmath33 transfer to the 5.714 mev state in @xmath1 mg is negligible as compared to @xmath34 transfer and we obtain the values of @xmath35 ev , @xmath36 ev , @xmath37 ev , that leads to @xmath38 mev .",
    "we also obtained the radiative width of the third level above threshold ( @xmath15 = 5.965  mev ; 0@xmath6 ) by calculating @xmath39 or @xmath40 for the transition to the lower lying @xmath30 and @xmath41 levels ( table  [ t : gamma0 ] ) .",
    "the calculated value , @xmath20 = 33.6  mev leads to a resonance strength of @xmath26 = 4.2  mev , only slightly higher than the estimated value @xcite of 2.5  mev .",
    "we performed a dwba analysis of some of neogy et al.@xcite data ( 6.120 , 6.350 and 7.341 levels ) to extend the comparison between calculated and experimental values and to put more constraint on the 6.120  mev @xmath1ne   ( or 5.714  mev @xmath1 mg ) level spectroscopic factor . for this purpose",
    ", we used the ecis code@xcite with the same optical potential parameters as neogy et al .    the 6.350  mev level ( fig .  5 of neogy et al.@xcite )",
    "was assumed to have a 6@xmath6 spin and parity and accordingly ( @xmath42 ) no dwba analysis was performed at that time . however , since then@xcite , a 6@xmath6 level has been located at 6.311  mev and a 4@xmath6 level at 6.345  mev . hence , it is almost certain that the 6.350  mev level in ref.@xcite was unduly identified with the 6@xmath6 instead of the 4@xmath6 level .",
    "accordingly , we made a dwba analysis of the neogy et al .",
    "data assuming that the reported level is a 4@xmath6 and extracted a spectroscopic factor .",
    "this new value is close ( within a factor of two ) to the calculated , 4@xmath43 level , value ( see table  [ t : spect ] ) .",
    "hence , shell model calculations reinforce the idea that the 6.35  mev level seen by neogy et al.@xcite is the 6.345 ; 4@xmath6 one instead of the 6.311 ; 6@xmath6 .",
    "our shell model calculations lead to a very small spectroscopic factor for the 7.341 ; @xmath44 level in complete contradiction with the value reported by neogy et al .",
    "however , less than three kev above ( @xmath4 = 7.344  mev ) lies a @xmath5 = @xmath45 level whose calculated spectroscopic factors ( for the 3@xmath43 and 4@xmath46 states ) agree much better with those extracted from experimental data ( table  [ t : spect ] ) .",
    "hence , the experimentally determined spectroscopic factor could be attributed to the 7.344  mev ; @xmath45 level rather than to the 7.341 ; @xmath44 one .    in order to put more constraint on the 6.120  mev @xmath1ne level we also performed a dwba analysis of the neogy et al .",
    "data for this level .",
    "( this analysis was not performed in the original work@xcite because `` the angular distribution does not exhibit characteristics of direct reactions '' . )",
    "the experimental data and dwba cross sections are represented in fig .",
    "[ f : neogy ] .",
    "as expected , the calculated transfer cross sections are more forward peaked than the experimental angular distribution suggesting a strong contribution from fusion reactions .",
    "when the theoretical spectroscopic factors are used , the @xmath47 contribution is negligible while the @xmath48 contribution is compatible with experimental data except for the most forward angle .",
    "requesting that the dwba cross sections remain below all experimental data points lead to upper limits for the spectroscopic factors of @xmath49 or 0.015 for @xmath50 = 0 or 2 respectively .",
    "while the @xmath50 = 2 upper limit is fully compatible with shell model calculations , the @xmath50 = 0 one is a factor of four below the calculated spectroscopic factor . from this upper limit",
    ", we obtain @xmath19 @xmath51 1  mev .",
    "one can note however that this limit should be taken with caution as it comes from a single data point at the smallest angle . as it can be seen in fig .  1 of neogy et al . , the 6.120  mev , @xmath1ne  peak is close to an other one from @xmath52ne ( arising from a ( d , p ) reaction on @xmath1ne  in the target . )",
    "resolving these two peaks at a lower angle should be more difficult because of the unfavorable evolutions of both their energy separation and relative heights .",
    "hence one can not exclude that the experimental error bars were underestimated in this case .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath15 = 5.714 ; 2@xmath6 level to the @xmath2na(p,@xmath3mgrate depends directly from its adopted proton width . from experimental data@xcite we deduced an approximate upper limit ( see comment above ) for this width ( @xmath19 @xmath51 1  mev ) .",
    "our shell model calculations give a slightly higher value ( @xmath19 = 4.5  mev ) . using the experimental total width ( @xmath17 = 16.5  mev ) ,",
    "one obtains @xmath0 @xmath9 3.2 or 1  mev , and @xmath26 = 2 . or 0.6  mev , when using the calculated or experimental upper limit for the proton widths .",
    "these values are close to the first ( 3.4@xcite and 3.8  mev@xcite ) and more recent estimated strengths ( 2.5 upper and 0.25  mev nominal values@xcite ) .",
    "one important conclusion resulting from the shell model calculations is that it is most unlikely that the spectroscopic factor is much smaller than one mev .",
    "this would exclude the lower limit for the rate@xcite obtained with a null spectroscopic factor .    the contribution of the 5.965  mev ;",
    "0@xmath6 level is obtained through our shell model calculation of its radiative width ( @xmath20 = 33.6  mev and @xmath26 = 4.2  mev ) . as in previous works@xcite",
    "we assume that the 5.837  mev ; ( 0 - 5 ) level , is the analog of the 5.910 ; 3@xmath53 level in @xmath1ne .",
    "this assignment made by @xcite , is not present anymore in@xcite but is likely from the examination of fig .",
    "[ f : levels ] and because of their similar gamma decay modes@xcite .",
    "accordingly , we take @xmath20 = 13  mev from the analog @xmath1ne  level and @xmath26 = 11.4  mev .",
    "the direct capture term@xcite is also left unchanged as it is based on experimental spectroscopic factors .",
    "following the good general agreement between calculated and experimental quantities , we derive the @xmath2na(p,@xmath3 mg  rate using the shell model calculated values presented above .",
    "the resonant part of the rate is approximated as usual by @xmath54 with @xmath55 = 334 .",
    ", 686 . for @xmath56",
    "= 2.52 , 3.95 , 5.49 respectively .",
    "the resulting rate is very close to the previous rates @xcite and of the recent upper rate limit@xcite but it is now put on a safer ground , in the domain of nova nucleosynthesis , as it now relies on shell model calculations rather than estimates . using the experimental upper limit instead of the calculated one for the first resonance strength would lead to a rate lying within a factor of three of the rates from refs .",
    "@xcite and from the nominal and upper rate limit from ref .",
    "( the proximity of these different rates is due to the strong experimental constraint introduced by @xmath17 = @xmath19 + @xmath20 = 16.5@xmath184.4  mev@xcite . )    in conlusion , the lower limit for the @xmath2na(p,@xmath3 mg  rate , used for calculating@xcite @xmath1na   yields in novae seems now excluded .",
    "unfortunately it was also the more efficient for @xmath1na  production through the @xmath2na(@xmath12ne(p,@xmath3na chain .",
    "hence the highest @xmath1na  yields reported@xcite are now excluded .",
    "a precise conclusion on gamma emission detectability will require further hydrodynamical calculations of nova outbursts .",
