    "bose - einstein condensation eventually occurs in a bosonic system , if one reduces the temperature at a fixed density .",
    "it is characterized by the macroscopic occupation of the lowest single particle energy mode and by the onset of long range coherence both in time and space .",
    "initially predicted by einstein for an ideal bose gas in 1924 , it has now been observed in a wide range of physical systems : in liquid helium @xcite , in ultracold atomic gases @xcite , and in a variety of condensed matter systems such as magnons in anti - ferromagnets @xcite , and exciton polaritons in microcavities @xcite . among all these systems ,",
    "ultracold atomic gases offer an unprecedented control on experimental parameters and allow very precise measurements as is custom in atomic physics .",
    "experimental investigation of time coherence in condensates began right after their achievement in the laboratory @xcite and the use of condensates in atomic clocks or interferometers is currently a cutting - edge subject of investigation @xcite .",
    "therefore a crucial issue is to determine the ultimate limits on the coherence time of these systems . unlike lasers and most solid state systems in",
    "which condensation has been observed , ultracold atomic gases are weakly coupled to their environment .",
    "the intrinsic coherence time of a condensate is then due to its interaction with the non - condensed modes in an ideally _ isolated _ system , which makes the problem unique and challenging .",
    "for the one dimensional quasi - condensate a theoretical treatment exists @xcite that was successfully compared with experiment @xcite . in a true three dimensional condensate ,",
    "the problem was solved in @xcite at zero temperature while until now it has been still open at non - zero temperature .    as it is known since the work of bogoliubov @xcite , the appropriate starting point for the description of a weakly interacting degenerate bose gas is that of a weakly interacting gas of quasi - particles : the bogoliubov excitations .",
    "the interactions among these quasiparticles shall play the main role in our problem .",
    "they have to be included in the formalism in a way that fulfills the constraint of energy conservation , a crucial point for an isolated system .",
    "a first set of works addressed the problem of phase coherence in condensates using open - system approaches in analogy with the laser @xcite : diffusive spreading of the condensate phase was predicted .",
    "these works however are not to be considered as quantitative , due to the fact that a simplified model is used in @xcite , and due to an approximate expression of the condensate phase derivative in @xcite . moreover , lacking the constraint of energy conservation , these approaches neglect some long time correlations among bogoliubov excitations that are responsible for a ballistic spreading in time of the condensate phase as shown in @xcite using many - body approaches .",
    "unfortunately the final prediction in @xcite does not include the interactions among bogoliubov modes : the bogoliubov excitations then do not decorrelate in time , the prediction quantitatively disagrees with quantum ergodic theory @xcite , and no diffusive regime for the condensate phase is found .",
    "finally , the ergodic approach in @xcite , while giving the correct ballistic spreading of the phase , can not predict a diffusive term .    as we now explain",
    ", quantum kinetic theory allows to include both energy conservation and quasi - particle interactions , and gives access to both the ballistic and the diffusive behavior of the phase . to be as general and as simple as possible",
    ", we consider a homogeneous gas in a box of volume @xmath5 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the condensate then forms in the plane wave with wave vector @xmath6 .",
    "the total number of particles is fixed to @xmath7 and the density is @xmath8 . let us consider the phase accumulated by the condensate during a time interval @xmath1 : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the condensate phase operator @xcite .",
    "due to the interactions with the bogoliubov quasi - particles , the accumulated condensate phase will not be exactly the same in each realization of the experiment .",
    "we say that the phase fluctuates and spreads out in time or that the variance @xmath11 is an increasing function of time . in presence of energy fluctuations in the initial state",
    ", the variance of the phase grows quadratically in time as already mentioned @xcite .",
    "quantitatively this may be seen as follows : for @xmath12 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the chemical potential which depends only on the energy of the isolated system @xcite . by linearizing @xmath14 around the average energy @xmath15 for small relative energy fluctuations , one finds @xmath16 this ballistic spreading in time of the phase is comparable to that of a group of cars traveling with different speeds .",
    "what happens if one reduces ideally to zero the energy fluctuations in the initial state ?",
    "we will show that the condensate phase will still spread but more slowly , with a diffusive motion .",
    "a precise calculation of the diffusion coefficient of the condensate phase in different experimental conditions , with or without fluctuations in the initial energy is the main goal of this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the most important section is the overview section [ sec : main_result ] : there we present the main results of the paper that we test against classical field simulations , and we indicate two possible schemes to observe them experimentally with cold atoms . further precisions and all the technical details",
    "are given in the subsequent sections .",
    "starting from kinetic equations in section [ sec : equations_cinetiques ] , that we linearize and solve in section [ sec : sole ] , we obtain explicit results for the phase variance in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "we discuss the effect of losses in section [ sec : losses ] and we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "for a low temperature gas @xmath17 the temporally coarse - grained derivative of the condensate phase can be expressed in terms of the numbers @xmath18 of quasi - particles of wave vector @xmath19 @xcite @xmath20 where the constant term @xmath21 is the ground state chemical potential of the gas and @xmath22 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath23 for interactions between cold atoms is linked to the @xmath24-wave scattering length @xmath25 by @xmath26 , @xmath27 being the atom mass , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 are the coefficients of the usual bogoliubov modes : @xmath30 as a consequence of ( [ eq : varphidot ] ) , the variance of the condensate phase is determined by the correlation functions of the bogoliubov quasiparticle numbers @xmath31 .",
    "let @xmath32 be the time correlation function of the condensate phase derivative @xcite : @xmath33 by integrating formally @xmath34 over time and using time translational invariance : @xmath35 from equation ( [ eq : varphi ] ) we see that two possible cases can occur .",

    "the two different scenarios are illustrated in figure [ fig : corr_thdot ] .",
    "to describe the evolution of the quasiparticles number fluctuations @xmath41 we write quantum kinetic equations @xcite that we linearize . introducing the vector @xmath42 of components @xmath43 , the vector @xmath44 of components @xmath45 : @xmath46 and the matrix @xmath47 of linearized kinetic equations",

    "we can show that @xmath54 is linked to energy fluctuations in the initial state and we recover the result ( [ eqs : varphi ] ) for the coefficient @xmath2 .",
    "the remaining component @xmath55 has zero mean energy . for the linear coefficient ruling diffusive phase spreading",
    "we find @xmath56 with : @xmath57 and for the constant term @xmath58 remarkably @xmath55 , and thus @xmath59 and @xmath4 , do not depend on the energy fluctuations of the initial state , up to second order in the relative energy fluctuations .",
    "we find that , in the thermodynamic limit , the rescaled diffusion coefficient @xmath60 is a universal function of @xmath61 that we show in figure [ fig : d_t ] .",
    "this universal scaling was also found in @xcite in the frame of a classical field model . at low temperature ,",
    "we have shown analytically that @xmath62 scales as the fourth power of @xmath63 , while at high temperature the rescaled diffusion coefficient grows approximately linearly with @xmath63 ( we expect logarithmic corrections to this law ) .",
    "as made evident by the rescaling , @xmath59 is proportional to the inverse of the system volume and thus vanishes in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the same property holds for @xmath4 , and also for @xmath2 in the case of canonical ensemble energy fluctuations . in fig.[figs : varphi ] for the temperature value @xmath64 we show the correlation function of the condensate phase derivative @xmath32 , that we calculate integrating ( [ eqs : xdot ] ) in time . on the same plot",
    "we show the variance of the condensate phase as a function of time that is obtained from ( [ eq : varphi ] ) .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of @xmath65 from equation ( [ eqs : abc ] ) is reached after a transient time that is typically the decay time of the correlation function @xmath32 .    in the high temperature regime @xmath66",
    ", we were able to test our predictions against exact simulations within a classical field model . in order to perform a quantitative comparison , we rephrased our kinetic theory for a classical field on a cubic lattice . in both the classical kinetic theory and the classical field simulations we introduce an energy cut - off such that the maximum energy on the cubic lattice is of order @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "we show the result of the comparison in fig.[fig : comp_clf ] .",
    "as expected the numerical value of the diffusion coefficient @xmath68 is different from the exact one given by the quantum theory and it depends in particular on the value of the cut - off . from the figure we find nevertheless a remarkable agreement between the classical kinetic theory and the classical field simulations .",
    "our findings could have an immediate impact on present experiments with atomic condensates .",
    "phase measurements have indeed already been successfully performed within two main schemes .",
    "the first scheme is out of equilibrium : starting from a condensate in a given internal state @xmath25 , one applies two coherent short electromagnetic pulses separated by an evolution period for the condensate phase .",
    "each pulse transfers a fraction of the atoms into another internal state @xmath69 .",
    "after the second pulse one measures the number of atoms in state @xmath69 . in the original realization of this interferometric scheme @xcite , @xmath70 pulses were used which produce a strongly out of equilibrium state of the system with a complex phase dynamics @xcite .",
    "we propose to transfer only a tiny fraction of atoms in each of the two pulses , so that the depletion of the @xmath25 condensate and the interactions within @xmath69 atoms may be neglected .",
    "moreover a spatial separation of @xmath25 and @xmath69 @xcite or a feshbach resonance @xcite may be used to suppress the @xmath71 interactions .",
    "the ideal limiting case would be to transfer in @xmath69 a single atom which could be detected in a high finesse optical cavity @xcite .",
    "using linear response theory one finds that the number of atoms in @xmath69 after the second pulse is proportional to @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the condensate operator , @xmath74 is the detuning of the coherent pulses from the single atom @xmath71 transition and @xmath75 is the time interval between the two pulses .",
    "this signal is directly dependent on @xmath76 .",
    "indeed @xmath77 $ ] .",
    "the second scheme uses a symmetric atomic josephson junction @xcite , in which one would cut the link between the two condensates by raising the potential barrier and measure the relative phase after an adjustable delay time . in this case",
    "an additional source of ballistic phase spreading is the partition noise proportional to the variance of the relative atom number . for homogeneous systems with canonical ensemble energy fluctuations on both sides of the josephson junction ,",
