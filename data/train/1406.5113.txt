    "it is widely accepted that most massive galaxies harbour supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in their centres @xcite . in hierarchical structure formation models , interactions and mergers between galaxies",
    "play an important role in their evolution and consequently in the growth of their central smbhs .",
    "thus , it is expected that a particular phase in the merging process , namely systems with dual smbhs exist in the universe . in such systems ,",
    "one or both of the smbhs may be active ; several studies suggest that the merging process can cause enhanced accretion onto the central smbhs and thus initiate `` activity '' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "high - resolution particle hydrodynamical simulations @xcite suggest that simultaneous activity is mostly expected at the late phases of mergers , at or below 10 kpc - scale separations .",
    "therefore dual active galactic nuclei ( agn , with two active smbhs in a merger system ) are expected to be observed .",
    "so far , only a few convincing cases of dual agn are known ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in some cases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , high spatial - resolution optical photometry and spectroscopy or high resolution very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) provided the unambiguous evidence of the dual system .",
    "originally , it was thought that the presence of double - peaked narrow optical emission lines is indicative of the existence of dual agn , as these lines may originate from the two distinct narrow line regions ( nlr ) of the two agn @xcite .",
    "however , several studies already in the eighties @xcite showed that double - peaked narrow emission lines can arise due to peculiar kinematics and jet  cloud interaction in a single nlr .",
    "as of now , there is no known observational approach which could be used to select a large sample of compelling dual agn candidates .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to check with independent methods whether the candidate sources are indeed dual systems .",
    "recently , @xcite reported the serendipitous discovery of two new dual agn candidates .",
    "they studied a sample of ten close - by , intermediate - type seyfert galaxies chosen from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) database .",
    "the intermediate - type seyfert galaxies ( spanning from sy 1.2 to sy 1.9 ) belong to seyfert 1 galaxies as they show broad emission lines , however with decreasing intensity @xcite .",
    "the role of this kind of agn within the unified scheme is not clear .",
    "surprisingly , half of the sample studied by @xcite showed narrow double - peaked emission lines .",
    "based upon the line ratios ( oiii / h@xmath0 , nii / h@xmath1 , sii / h@xmath1 and oi / h@xmath1 ) , @xcite concluded that among the five double - peaked narrow - line emitters , two ( ngc5515 and mrk1469 ) are good candidates for being dual agns .",
    "both of the sources are radio emitters .",
    "we conducted high - resolution radio imaging observations of the brighter radio source , ngc  5515 , with the european vlbi network ( evn ) .",
    "the best resolution achieved was @xmath2milli - arcseconds ( mas ) , which corresponds to a projected linear distance of @xmath3pc in the rest frame of the source , at a redshift of @xmath4=0.0257 , assuming a flat @xmath5cdm cosmological model with @xmath6=70  kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 , @xmath8=0.27 , and @xmath9=0.73 @xcite . in this model ,",

    "the results are presented in section  [ results ] and further discussed , together with the related optical data , in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "the summary is given in section  [ sum ] .",
    "we observed the nucleus of ngc  5515 with the evn at 1.7 and 5  ghz frequencies ( project codes eg070a and eg070b ) .",
    "the observations were conducted in e - vlbi mode @xcite where the participating radio telescopes are connected to the central evn data processor at the joint institute for vlbi in europe ( jive , dwingeloo , the netherlands ) via optical fibre networks , to allow correlation in real time .",
    "the maximum data transmission rate per station was 1024  mbit  s@xmath7 , resulting in a total bandwidth of 128  mhz in both left and right circular polarizations , using 2-bit sampling .",
    "both experiments lasted for 4  h. their dates ( 2013 april 16 at 1.7  ghz and 2013 june 18 at 5  ghz ) were chosen close to each other to minimize the effects of potential long - term source variability . at 1.7  ghz ,",
    "the following 7 radio telescopes provided useful data : effelsberg ( germany ) , medicina ( italy ) , onsala ( sweden ) , toru ( poland ) , hartebeesthoek ( south africa ) , sheshan ( china ) , and the phased array of the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt , the netherlands ) . at 5  ghz , the successfully participating 7 radio telescopes were effelsberg , medicina , toru , hartebeesthoek , sheshan , the wsrt , and yebes ( spain ) .",
    "ngc  5515 was observed in phase - reference mode ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the calibrator is one of the defining sources of the current 2nd realization of the international celestial reference frame ( icfr2 , * ? ? ?",

    "no loss of data , the expected image thermal noise level was 14  @xmath17jy  beam@xmath7 and 16  @xmath17jy  beam@xmath7 at 1.7 and 5  ghz , respectively .",
    "the noise levels achieved in practice depend on various factors e.g. downtimes , actual system temperatures , data rate limitations , and radio - frequency interference at the telescope sites .",
    "the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was used for the data calibration in a standard way ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the visibility amplitudes were calibrated using system temperatures and antenna gains measured at the telescope sites .",
    "fringe - fitting was performed for the calibrator source j1419 + 3821 .",
    "the calibrator data were then exported to the difmap package @xcite for imaging . the conventional hybrid mapping procedure involving several iterations of cleaning @xcite and phase ( then amplitude ) self - calibration resulted in an image and a brightness distribution model for the practically unresolved calibrator .",
    "overall antenna gain correction factors ( typically less than 10 per cent ) were determined in difmap and applied to the visibility amplitudes in aips .",
    "fringe - fitting was repeated for the phase - reference calibrator in aips , now taking its clean component model into account in order to compensate for small residual phases resulting from its structure .",
    "the solutions obtained were interpolated and applied to the ngc  5515 data .",
    "the calibrated and phase - referenced visibility data of ngc  5515 were imaged in difmap .",
    "because the a priori position of the central radio source in ngc  5515 used for correlation was accurate to only @xmath16@xmath18 , the phase centre was shifted to the location of the brightness peak . after obtaining an initial clean component model , a phase - only self - calibration was performed for 15-min solution intervals , to correct for long - period phase variations at the antennas .",
    "the source appeared the most resolved on the baselines to sheshan , therefore data from this telescope were fixed before another cleaning and phase self - calibration was performed , now with 5-min solution intervals .",
    "finally , only the phases at the two most sensitive antennas , effelsberg and the wsrt were allowed to vary when the self - calibration solution interval was set to zero .",

    "we also reduced vla observations of ngc  5515 found in the nrao archive .",
    "the source was observed in the most extended a configuration at l , c , and x bands ( at 1.5 , 5 , and 8 ghz ) in snapshot mode on 1991 aug 24 , 1992 oct 20 , and 1995 aug 14 , respectively .",
    "( the project codes were : ac301 , af233 and am484 ) .",
    "additionally , the source was observed in snapshot mode at l band in b configuration on 1993 apr 26 ( project i d . :",
    "at149 ) as well .",
    "the on - source integration times were less than 5 min in all cases .",
    "ngc  5515 was detected as a point source in all three bands with the following flux densities : in a - configuration @xmath20mjy , @xmath21mjy , and @xmath22mjy ; and in b - configuration @xmath23mjy .",
    "the source was also observed with the vla at l band in the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss , * ? ? ? * ) and the faint images of the radio sky at twenty - centimeters ( first , * ? ? ?",

    ", there is a hint of a somewhat more extended structure in about the east  west direction .",
    "this notion is supported by the fact that the interferometer phases on the baselines from the european antennas to hartebeesthoek ( i.e. north  south direction ) appeared less noisy than on the baselines to sheshan ( east  west direction , at about the same baseline length ) , therefore the source seems more resolved in the latter direction .    to quantitatively characterize the brightness distribution of ngc  5515",
    ", we fitted gaussian model components directly to the self - calibrated vlbi visibility data in difmap .",
    "the parameters of the best - fitting elliptical gaussian model components are given in table  [ modelfit ] .",
    "the statistical errors are estimated according to @xcite , assuming additional 5% flux density calibration uncertainties .",
    "the sizes of the fitted model components exceed the values obtained for the minimum resolvable angular size ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in our experiments .",
    "consistently with our previous remark on the possible extension , the major axes of the gaussians at both frequencies closely align with the east  west direction ( i.e. position angle 90 ; the position angles are measured from north through east ) .",
    "notably , these are almost coincident with the major axis direction of the disk and the pseudobulge of the host galaxy ( 103104 , * ? ? ?",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     based on the fitted vlbi component flux densities , the two - point spectral index is @xmath26 ( where the spectral index is defined as @xmath27 ) .",
    "this indicates a slightly inverted radio spectrum , unless the source was strongly variable between the two observing epochs separated by @xmath162 months .    at 5 ghz",
    ", the wsrt data taken parallel with the evn observation were also analyzed .",
    "the recovered flux density is @xmath28mjy , close to the value obtained by evn ( table [ modelfit ] ) .",
    "thus , the source is dominated by the emission from the compact core , the large - scale structure resolved out by evn observation accounts for @xmath29mjy ( @xmath30 per cent ) .    according to the archival vla a - configuration observations ,",
    "the source is significantly brighter at 8ghz than at lower frequencies .",
    "however , the spectral index is also compatible with a flat spectral shape as well as an inverted spectral shape ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "moreover , there is a large temporal gap between the observations ( three years ) , therefore intrinsic source variability may hinder the estimation of the spectral index of the source .",
    "indeed , the variability is apparent , when comparing observations performed at the same resolution and frequency ( vla b - configuration at 1.4 ghz ) .",
    "the source was significantly brighter ( more than @xmath32 per cent ) in april 1993 than in the first survey observation conducted in 1994 .",
    "even though the spectral index can not be calculated reliably from the archival vla observations , the measurements agree with the source having most likely flat or slightly inverted spectrum and thus in accord with the spectral index determined from our evn measurements .",
    "the displayed variability and the spectral shape is consistent with the radio emission coming from a compact partially self - absorbed synchrotron source @xcite .",
    "the astrometric position of the 5-ghz radio brightness peak in ngc  5515 ( right ascension @xmath1=@xmath33 and declination @xmath34=@xmath35 ) was derived using the maxfit verb in aips .",
    "we estimate that each coordinate is accurate to within 1  mas .",
    "the sources of the positional error are the thermal noise of the interferometer phases , the error of the phase - reference calibrator position , and the systematic error of phase - referencing observations mainly originating from the ionospheric and tropospheric fluctuations . in our case ,",
    "the latter is by far the most dominant error component .",
    "the position of the brightness peak at 1.7  ghz coincides with the 5-ghz position well within the uncertainties .    a large window of @xmath36 around the brightness peak , within the undistorted field of view , was checked for additional radio emission .",
    "this size corresponds to a region of 4.25  kpc  @xmath37  4.25  kpc at the distance of ngc  5515 .",
    "no other compact radio component was found above the @xmath166@xmath38 image noise level of 0.13  mjy  beam@xmath7 at 1.7  ghz .",
    "we also checked the field of view of the archival vla data for possible radio sources . according to the optical sdss image ,",
    "the size of the ngc5515 galaxy is roughly @xmath39 . within this range",
    "we did not detect any additional radio emitting source in the vla images above @xmath40 image noise level ( @xmath41-@xmath42mjy beam@xmath7 ) .",
    "we calculated the rest - frame brightness temperature of the radio source in ngc  5515 , @xmath43 ( @xmath44 is given in jy , @xmath45 and @xmath46 in mas , and @xmath47 in ghz ) using the gaussian model parameters listed in table  [ modelfit ] .",
    "the values obtained ( higher than @xmath48  k , see table  [ modelfit ] ) clearly prove the agn - related non - thermal synchrotron origin of the radio emission since the brightness temperatures for thermally - dominated `` normal '' galaxies ( i.e. the ones with no central active nucleus ) do not exceed @xmath16@xmath49  k ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "our non - detection of any additional compact source in the field of view implies an upper limit of the radio power @xmath50  whz@xmath7 . according to e.g.",
    "@xcite and @xcite , agn have high - luminosity cores , with power exceeding @xmath51 , therefore we can rule out the existence of another radio - emitting agn in the field of view .",
    "we can thus conclude that there is no dual radio - emitting agn in the centre of ngc  5515 .",
    "the coordinates of the detected radio source agree with the position of the optical galaxy in sdss dr9 within the errors .",
    "( the distance between the optical and radio positions is @xmath52 . )",
    "according to the sdss , there is an optical source @xmath53 away from the radio position , sdss j141237.38 + 391835.2 , at a similar redshift ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "we checked the l - band and c - band evn maps at the position of this source and we did not find any radio source down to a brightness limit of @xmath55 and @xmath56 in l band and c band , respectively .",
    "these brightness limits were calculated by taking into account the bandwidth and time - average smearing effects @xcite .",
    "there is also an x - ray source at a distance of @xmath57 from the radio position in the rosat all - sky survey faint source catalog ( rass - fsc , * ? ? ?",
    "since its positional uncertainty is @xmath58 , it can be related to either of the two optical sources .",
    "however , given that our radio observations indicate an agn in the nucleus of ngc5515 , the x - ray emission is most likely associated with that object .",
    "we re - analyzed the sdss spectrum of ngc  5515 .",
    "similarly to @xcite , we found that the narrow h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 , oiii , nii , and sii emission lines are double - peaked .",
    "the double peaks are only marginally resolved in the sdss spectrum .",
    "reasonable fitting was achieved by using the same fitting scheme for the other lines as derived for the sii line .",
    "the velocities of the blue shifted and redshifted lines are @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .    according to @xcite , the width of the oiii line at wavelength of @xmath61(@xmath62 ) can be used as a surrogate value for the velocity dispersion as @xmath63 .",
    "therefore one can use the width of the two gaussian profiles fitted to the oiii line to estimate the masses of the two putative black holes separately in a dual agn ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in the case of ngc  5515 ,",
    "the velocity dispersions for the blue and red lines are @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively . thus using the coefficients derived for pseudobulges from @xcite , the assumed black hole masses are : @xmath66 and @xmath67 , derived from the blue- and redshifted lines , respectively .",
    "we compare the sum of these assumed two black hole masses with the mass estimates of @xcite who derived the black hole mass for ngc  5515 as a single black hole system using the @xmath68 relation for galaxies containing pseudobulges @xcite , and with the scaling relation between bolometric luminosity and black hole mass @xcite .",
    "the two methods yielded the following consistent values : @xmath69 and @xmath70 . using the slightly different values for pseudobulges given by @xcite",
    ", a higher black hole estimate can be obtained from the @xmath68 relation : @xmath71 .",
    "our sum of the assumed two black hole masses derived above ( @xmath72 ) agrees well with the values calculated with the assumption that only one supermassive black hole resides in ngc  5515 .    knowing the masses , we can derive the eddington luminosities following @xcite : @xmath73 in the scenario with two black holes separately : @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "if we assume that the two black holes with similar masses contribute to the measured bolometric luminosity , @xmath76",
    "@xcite evenly , we obtain an eddington ratio of @xmath77 for each .",
    "assuming instead , a scenario where a single black hole is responsible for the observed bolometric luminosity , the implied eddington ratio is @xmath78 .",
    "all these values are within the range of eddington ratios derived for seyfert galaxies ( @xmath79 and @xmath80 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) .",
    "thus , based upon the mass estimates , we can not exclude either the single or the dual black hole scenarios .",
    "one possible explanation for the double - peaked narrow emission lines is dual agn , but such a spectrum can also be explained as originating from biconic outflows or rotating disks on kpc scales or otherwise disturbed nlr kinematics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in that case , it is the same single agn which illuminates the nlr , therefore it is expected that the blue- and redshifted lines have similar characteristics . in the case of ngc  5515 , both the line widths and the line ratios ( oiii / h@xmath0 , nii / h@xmath1 , sii / h@xmath1 ) are very similar , equal within the uncertainties , for the blue- and redshifted components",
    ". therefore the double - peaked emission lines can be explained in a straightforward way if both components are ionized by the same source .",
    "recent studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) also show that the double - peaked emission - line diagnostics alone is an inefficient way of identifying real dual agn , but proposed that in combination with other methods such as long - slit spectroscopy and x - ray and/or radio imaging observations , dual agn candidates can be chosen more reliably .",
    "based upon the optical spectrum of ngc  5155 , @xcite claimed that this galaxy is a good candidate for hosting dual agn .",
    "we investigated this source using available multi - frequency radio data and new high - resolution vlbi observations conducted with the evn .",
    "our evn observations revealed a compact radio emitting source with inverted spectrum , and brightness temperature exceeding @xmath48k .",
    "this radio emission clearly originates from a non - thermal synchrotron source associated with an agn .",
    "the agn nature of the radio emission is also in agreement with the long - term radio variability suggested by archival vla data .",
    "the position of the radio emitting source in our evn maps agrees within the errors with the optical position of ngc  5155 .",
    "we did not detect any additional radio source within @xmath2kpc of the nucleus . according to archival vla observations",
    ", there is no additional radio emitting feature down to a brightness level of @xmath81 in the entire region covered by the galaxy in the sdss optical image .",
    "there is an optical source at a distance of @xmath82 from the radio position of ngc  5515 .",
    "we did not detect any radio emission in our evn maps at this position , either .",
    "thus , we can exclude the possibility of having two radio - emitting agn in the seyfert galaxy ngc  5515 .",
    "however , we can not exclude from our vlbi data that a secondary radio - quiet agn resides in the galaxy .",
    "we re - analysed the sdss spectrum of ngc  5155 , and fitted the h@xmath1 , h@xmath0 , oiii , nii , and sii emission lines with double - peaked profiles .",
    "the parameters obtained from the fitting of the red and blue components are very similar .",
    "the line ratios are the same for the blue and red components . assuming a scenario with dual agn",
    ", we estimated the black hole masses from the blue and red components of the oiii line , and found that the sum of the inferred two black hole masses is in agreement with the total mass estimates given by @xcite .",
    "thus , the double - peaked narrow lines in the spectrum of ngc  5155 can be explained either by assuming two smbhs with very similar masses and ionizing properties , from which only one is radio - emitting , or more plausibly by assuming one common ionizing source residing in the nlr , a single radio - emitting agn .",
    "double - peaked narrow emission lines were originally thought to be a promising tool to select dual agn , however their usefulness is severely questioned as other explanations ( outflows , disturbed nlr kinematics , or a rotating disk ) can equally well account for the observed spectral shapes in several cases .",
