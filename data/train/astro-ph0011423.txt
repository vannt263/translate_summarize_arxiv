    "gc spectra were obtained in two observing runs , one in 1994 with wht / ldss-2 ( sharples et al .",
    "1998 ) , and the second in 1998 with cfht / mos ( beasley et al .",
    "2000 ; zepf et al .",
    "gc candidates for both runs were chosen from washington photometry ( geisler et al .",
    "1996 ) , with colour ( @xmath1 ) and magnitude ( @xmath2 ) selection .",
    "spectra were obtained over the wavelength range 3600@xmath36000  , with a resolution of 3@xmath36  , and a velocity precision of 50@xmath3100 km / sec .",
    "exposure times were 3@xmath33.5 hours per mask .",
    "we have a total sample of 144 confirmed gcs in ngc 4472 , out to @xmath4 7   radius ( @xmath4 30 kpc , 6 r@xmath5 ) .",

    "we confirm our earlier result ( sharples et al .",
    "1998 ) that the metal - poor gcs have a significantly higher velocity dispersion than the metal - rich gcs .",

    ", v/@xmath6 @xmath7 0.34 at 99% confidence .",
    "this absence of rotation in the more centrally - concentrated metal - rich gcs seems to require significant outward angular momentum transport ( from a merger ? ) .",
    "we have used the deprojected gc velocity dispersion and density profiles together with the jeans equation to derive the mass distribution of ngc 4472 , with the assumption of isotropic gc orbits .",
    "* figure 2 * shows the resulting mass profile for ngc 4472 , compared with that obtained from x - ray data ( irwin & sarazin 1996 ) .",
    "there is reasonable agreement between the two profiles , and we confirm the existence of a substantial dark matter halo in ngc 4472 , with a m / l ratio @xmath8 at 30 kpc radius .",
    "to improve the s / n ratio for age and abundance analysis , we have co - added our gc spectra by colour into four bins with 30@xmath335 gcs each . for each bin , we have measured age ( h@xmath9 , h@xmath10 , h@xmath11 ) and metallicity ( mg@xmath12 , fe5270/5335 ) sensitive indices , on the lick system .",
    "* figure 3 * shows the predictions of worthey ( 1994 ) models for the ngc 4472 gcs in the mg@xmath12 , h@xmath9 plane .",
    "based on a galactic gc calibration , the ngc 4472 gcs span a metallicity range @xmath0 \\leq 0 $ ] dex .",
    "it is notoriously difficult to determine _ absolute _ gc ages , but within the errors all four bins are coeval ; we can further say that all gcs are older than 6 gyr at 95% confidence .",
    "interestingly , the metal - rich gcs are 0.7 @xmath13 7 gyr younger than the metal - poor gcs .",
