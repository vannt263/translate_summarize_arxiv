    "the search for the conjectured qcd critical point has attracted much theoretical and experimental effort .",
    "the fluctuations of critical modes scale with the equilibrium correlation length @xmath0 and consequently become prominent near the critical point .",
    "since critical fluctuations contribute to the moments of net baryon number fluctuations , these fluctuation observables are considered to be tell tale signs of the presence of the qcd critical point  @xcite .    of particular importance",
    "are the non - gaussian skewness and kurtosis cumulants , which are respectively the third and fourth cumulants .",
    "they are more sensitive to the growth of the correlation length @xmath0 compared with the gaussian cumulants  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , even qualitative features of the non - gaussian cumulants such as a change in sign , and the associated non - monotonicity , can signal the presence of criticality in the qcd phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "the beam energy dependence of those non - gaussian cumulants have been measured by the star experiment ; these are discussed in some of the contributions to these proceedings .",
    "however , nature is secretive because the qcd critical point is shielded by non - equilibrium effects : developing a larger correlation length requires a longer time .",
    "universality arguments  @xcite indicate that the relaxation time of critical modes is divergent . as a result",
    ", real time critical fluctuations of qcd matter created in heavy - ion collisions could be significantly different from the corresponding equilibrium values  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we studied the real time evolution of non - gaussian cumulants in the qcd critical regime and implications thereof on searches for the qcd critical point ; we will summarize the principal results here .",
    "specifically , in @xcite , we derived a set of evolution equations for the cumulants of critical modes .",
    "our approach is schematically summarized below : @xmath1 \\label{fp1 } % \\nonumber   \\\\ \\label{fp2 } & \\longrightarrow & \\,\\,\\,\\ ,    \\frac{d\\kappa_{n}(\\tau)}{d\\tau } = \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\rm eff } } \\bar{l}_{n}\\left[\\kappa_{1},\\kappa_{2},\\ldots,\\kappa_{n};r , h\\right]+{\\cal o}\\left(\\frac{\\xi_{\\rm eq}}{l_{\\rm sys}}\\right ) \\ , .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we start with a fokker - planck equation on the l.h.s of eq .",
    "( [ fp1 ] ) , which describes the relaxation of @xmath2 towards equilibrium . here",
    "@xmath2 is the probability distribution of the ( space averaged ) critical mode @xmath3 .",
    "the proper time @xmath4 characterizes a trajectory in the  cross - over \" vicinity of the critical regime .",
    "@xmath5 denotes the differential operator acting on @xmath6 .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the dynamical universal exponent ; for the qcd critical point , @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "one thereby implements dynamical universality .",
    "since we are interested in the evolutions of cumulants , we translate the fokker - planck equation into an ( infinite ) set of evolution equations for cumulants @xmath10 , see r.h.s of ( [ fp1 ] ) . @xmath11 $ ] is a polynomial of @xmath12 with coefficients depend on @xmath13 .",
    "it is easy to convince oneself that this set of equations is exact and contains the same amount of information as the original fokker - planck equation .",
    "however , its practical application is limited since the evolution of the lower cumulants depends on that of the higher cumulants .",
    "our key observation is that in the regime that the equilibrium correlation length @xmath0 is much smaller than the size of the system @xmath14 ( but still larger than any other microscopic scale @xmath15 ) , the evolution of lower cumulants are effectively decoupled from those of higher cumulants .",
    "we thus arrive at ( [ fp2 ] ) , describing the closed form evolution cumulants  @xcite .",
    "we wish to apply ( [ fp2 ] ) to study the evolution of cumulants in qcd critical regime .",
    "the results depend on both universal and non - universal inputs .",
    "universal inputs include the dependence of the equilibrium distribution on the well known ising variables @xmath16 and @xmath17 and the previously noted scaling form of @xmath18 .",
    "we also need to specify inputs to the evolution that are non - universal .",
    "in particular , the mapping between the qcd variables @xmath19 and @xmath13 is non - universal .",
    "we will use the conventional linear mapping relation , i.e. @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the location of the critical point in qcd phase diagram .",
    "we take simplified yet phenomenologically motivated parametrizations for trajectories passing the critical regime .",
    "these include @xmath22 , the proper time at which the system enters into the critical regime .",
    "we note the duration of the system in the critical regime is roughly proportional to @xmath22 .",
    "we also introduced @xmath23 , which is @xmath24 at the boundary of the critical regime . after fixing these parameters ,",
    "our result will only depend on the dimensionless ratio @xmath25 .",
