    "<S> taken together , key latest observations assume that ( i ) * old * metal - rich globular cluster populations ( mrgcps ) in bulges were able to form due to essentially increased , self(internally)-induced star formation rate ( sfr ) in the hosts , while galaxy merging played an additional role ; ( ii ) massive star cluster populations ( mscps ) in irregulars may be young , less prominent counterparts of the old mrgcps in spheroids . </S>"
