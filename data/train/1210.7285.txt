    "isotropic dielectric media , such as gases or cubic crystals , can exhibit nonlinear birefringence for incident field frequencies in the transparency region @xcite .",
    "this nonlinear optical anisotropy ( noa ) is revealed in pump - probe schemes in which a linearly polarized pump field is incident on the medium along with a co - propagating weak probe field polarized either parallel or perpendicular to the pump .",
    "for the case of a kerr nonlinear medium , this yields a difference in refractive index experienced by the orthogonally polarized probes that is proportional to pump intensity . in other words ,",
    "the orthogonally polarized probes induce different dipole moments along their respective directions in the presence of the pump .",
    "various pump - probe schemes are at the heart of recent approaches to measure the nonlinear optical properties and filamentation dynamics of atmospheric pressure gases , such as air or argon @xcite .",
    "if the pump pulse is sufficiently intense to generate freed electrons via multi - photon or tunneling ionization , this raises the issue of whether these electrons also contribute to the noa . here",
    ", we use the term freed electrons to describe those that are no longer bound , but may still be correlated with the parent ion , as opposed to strictly free electrons .",
    "physically , the linearly polarized pump pulse drives the freed electrons along the polarization direction , thereby creating an anisotropic momentum and spatial distribution for the electrons .",
    "however , it is a common assumption that freed electrons exhibit an isotropic optical response .",
    "this is true if the freed electrons and associated ions have had ample time to undergo coulomb scattering and produce a collective plasma whose momentum distribution is isotropic . from simulations of the quantum boltzmann equation for an atomic gas",
    ", it has been established @xcite that anisotropic features of the momentum distribution survive for a time of order @xmath0 , given by the inverse plasma frequency .",
    "a collective isotropic plasma appears for longer times @xmath1 , with @xmath2 fs and @xmath1 a few picoseconds for conditions typical of femtosecond filamentation in atmospheric pressure gases .",
    "thus , for pulse durations greater than @xmath1 , freed electrons should yield an isotropic optical response .",
    "however , for pulse durations less than @xmath3 , we expect that any anisotropy due to freed electrons will persist and may lead to a noa .",
    "photo - induced birefringence in semiconductors due to single - photon ionization provides an example of a noa due to freed electrons for optical fields @xcite .",
    "it has been recently shown @xcite that an anisotropic electron momentum distribution can reveal itself using a thz probe . in this paper , we present a computational study of the pump - probe response of a single atom , in order to assess any microscopic noa due to freed electrons for optical fields . essentially , we inquire if the freed electrons retain a `` memory '' of the linear polarization of the pump pulse that generated them .",
    "we restrict simulated pulse durations to less than @xmath4 , so that anisotropy of the electron distribution due to the pump pulse will be minimally degraded by electron - electron interactions , and so that a single atom approach is sufficient .",
    "in particular , using simulations of the single particle schrdinger equation , the induced dipole moment along two probe directions is calculated to assess any noa .",
    "two pump models are examined : a delta - function pump of zero temporal duration , and a realistic pump with non - zero duration . in both cases , we find that a sizeable anisotropic nonlinear atomic response can occur due to freed electrons .",
    "our hope is that these computational results provide impetus for future experimental and theoretical studies of noa due to freed electrons on ultrashort time scales .",
    "in addition to being of fundamental interest , our results may have implications for the interpretation of ultrashort pump - probe experiments aimed at measuring nonlinear optical properties in the presence of freed electrons ( e.g. @xcite ) since they rely on the assumption of an isotropic freed - electron response .",
    "similarly , `` plasma '' isotropy is invariably assumed in computer aided modeling of femtosecond filamentation  @xcite , so the current model may require corrections .",
    "our starting point is the three - dimensional ( 3d ) schrdinger equation in atomic units ( a.u . ) for the wave function @xmath5 of an electron under the actions of the coulomb potential due to the parent ion and the pump and probe fields @xmath6\\psi   , \\ ] ] where @xmath7=[v_p+v_{pr}]$ ] is the interaction energy between the atom and pump ( @xmath8 ) and probe ( @xmath9 ) fields in the dipole approximation . in the absence of pump and probe fields ,",

    "we perform a convergence study of measured observables to ensure that both radial and longitudinal grid sizes are sufficient to accommodate the expanding , pump - driven wave function .",
