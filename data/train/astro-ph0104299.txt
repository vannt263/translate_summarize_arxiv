    "the integral mission will dedicate half of its core program to semi - annual deep exposures of the central radian the galaxy , and a quarter to weekly scans of the galactic plane ( winkler 2000 ) .",
    "together with incidental observations from the rest of the core program and the general program , the coverage of the galactic center region will be large . in this respect",
    "it is interesting to assess what prospects lie ahead for integral in the area of detecting x - ray transients .",
    "thanks to dedicated and sensitive observations with bepposax and rxte in recent years the observational database about these transients is growing .",
    "we summarize recent developments .",
    "we define a transient as a source that in the medium x - ray energy range ( a few kev to a few tens of kev )    * has a quiescent level below 1 mcrab ( equivalent to @xmath2   if at a distance equal to that of the galactic center ) ; * if it peaks above 10 mcrab ; * if it shows activity for at least 10  sec ; * if it is mostly in quiescence .",
    "this definition provides fairly easy discrimination between transient and persistent sources .",
    "usually the definition is stricter ( e.g. , for lmxbs see van paradijs & verbunt 1984 ) . in particular , one often demands that the difference between peak and quiescent flux is at least a factor 10@xmath3 . however , this is difficult to test without observations with narrow - field sensitive x - ray telescopes as is the case for many transients observed in the 30-year history of space - borne x - ray astronomy .",
    "the broad range of time scales allowed in the definition is chosen to be able to include recent discoveries of bursting x - ray sources that show no simultaneously detectable persistent emission .",
    "a variety of objects pertain to this definition .",
    "first of all , the x - ray binaries in which a neutron star or black hole orbits a non - degenerate star ( for a review , see white et al . 1995 ) .",
    "furthermore , it includes gamma - ray bursts , nearby flare stars , pre - main sequence stars ( with typical on - times of a few hours ) , and rs cvn stars ( up to a few days ) .",
    "all transients have isotropic sky distributions except for the x - ray binaries ( see figure  [ fig1 ] )",
    ". the high - mass x - ray binaries , with companions to the compact stars of spectral types o and b , consist of young objects that are concentrated along the galactic plane .",
    "the low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , with companions of type a and later , are older and are therefore typically found in globular clusters and in a concentration towards the galactic center .",
    "in fact , more than half of all lmxbs are found within the central 20@xmath4 monitoring programs of the galactic center region , therefore , provide a unique opportunity to observe a large fraction of the lmxb population in an unbiased manner .    in the remainder",
    ", we concentrate on lmxbs .",
    "six dedicated observation programs have been carried out to monitor specifically the galactic center region for transient x - ray activity above a few kev .",
    "they are listed in table  [ tab1 ] together with the currently active rxte all - sky monitor ( asm ) program as a reference .",
    "the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) was operated during the 2nd spacelab mission in 1985 and was the first telescope to resolve an image of the galactic center region above 2 kev ( skinner et al .",
    "the coded mask imaging spectrometer ( comis ) observed intermittently for 12 years but most of the exposure was gathered before 1994 ( in  t  zand 1992 , emelyanov et al .",
    "art - p on the granat platform was operated for a more limited time ( pavlinksy et al .",
    "1994 ) than sigma on the same platform .",
    "the sigma program distinguishes itself by the largest exposure time of all programs and by being the first @xmath5-ray imaging device .",
    "all instruments cover typical field of views of 10@xmath4 combined with arcminute angular resolution and sensitivity in the 2 - 100 kev range ( the same range as for future integral observations ) .",
    "all employed instruments except pca / rxte are coded aperture devices .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,<,>,^,^ , > \" , ]     @xmath6uncertain type - i classification ; @xmath7 in globular cluster .",
    "there are two types of x - ray bursts : type i and ii .",
    "both have durations of order 1 minute and show fast - rise exponential - decay time profiles .",
    "the difference is that type - i bursts have few - kev black - body spectra with cooling in the tail while type - ii bursts do not cool and have spectra very reminiscent to that of the emission outside bursts .",
    "type - ii bursts are assumed to be due to instabilities in the accretion disk ( e.g. , lewin et al .",
    "1993 ) while type - i bursts are recognized as thermonuclear flashes on surfaces of neutron stars .",
    "currently , only two type - ii bursters are known ( additionally , there is a tentative type - ii burster identification of the bright x - ray source in the globular cluster terzan 5 ; markwardt et al .",
    "type - i bursts are powerful diagnostics for the nature of the compact object : they eliminate black holes or white dwarfs as candidates .",
    "the wfcs have detected more than 2000 x - ray bursts in lmxbs , about 1500 of these are type - i bursts .",
    "table  [ tabbursters ] presents a list of 35 bursters that were seen active within 20@xmath4 from the galactic center .",
    "this includes 17 new identifications of bursters .",
    "bursts were also detected from 14 sources outside this field , including 5 new ones .",
    "bursts were not detected by wfc from 16 non - listed and known bursters .",
    "therefore , wfc has seen 75% of the burster population in an active state .",
    "particularly interesting bursting behavior was seen in gs  1826 - 24 where the bursts follow each other without exception during years of observations quasi - periodically with a period of about 5.7  hr ( ubertini et al .",
    "this is in parellel to a very stable persistent flux which reflects a very stable mass acretion rate by the neutron star .",
    "changes on time scales of years of the periodicity seem to go hand in hand with changes in the persistent flux ( cocchi et al .",
    "gs  1826 - 24 therefore provides a unique testbed for theories on burst triggering mechanisms ( e.g. , bildsten 2000 ) .    within the group of 49 persistent lmxbs ,",
    "the fraction of bursters is @xmath8 ( note that this fraction can only grow ) . for transient lmxb",
    ", this is @xmath9 .",
    "the different fraction reflects the notion that the only black hole lmxbs found thus far are transient in nature . within the gc field ,",
    "the brightest bursting lmxb transient is a1742 - 289 .",
    "however , the identification of a1742 - 289 with simultaneous bursting activity is not definite ( carpenter 1976 and lewin et al .",
    "1976 , see also maeda et al .",
    "1996 and kennea & skinner 1996 ) . apart from a1742 - 289",
    ", the brightest bursting lmxb transient is 2s  1803 - 245 ( muller et al . , 1998 and revnivtsev et al . 2000 ) with a peak of 0.7 crab units .",
    "all others have peak fluxes at least a factor of 2 less .",
    "the brightest bursting persistent lmxb in the field is gx  17 + 2 with an average flux of 0.6 crab units .      arguably , sax  j1808.4 - 3658 is the most intriguing x - ray transient found since the microquasars grs  1915 + 105 and gro  j1655 - 40 . discovered in 1996 by the wfcs as a 0.1  crab x - ray transient ( in t zand et al .",
    "1998c ) , it was first measured with the more sensitive pca in a second outburst in early 1998 when a pulsar signal was found with a period of 2.5  ms ( wijnands & van der klis 1998 ) .",
    "this represents the first and sofar only discovery of an accreting millisecond pulsar .",
    "such systems were long sought after because lmxbs are thought to be the precursor of millisecond radio pulsars ( e.g. , bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 ) .    ]    there is indirect evidence for millisecond neutron star rotation periods in other lmxbs .",
    "transient millisecond oscillations have been found in rxte - pca data during ( parts of ) x - ray bursts in 10 lmxbs ( 4u  1728 - 34 , 4u  1636 - 53 , 4u  1702 - 429 , ks  1731 - 260 , aql  x-1 , x1658 - 298 , 4u  1608 - 52 , 4u  1916 - 05 , the rapid burster and a source close to galactic center ) .",
    "since the asymptotic frequencies of most of these oscillations are reproducable over years , the suggestion is strong to interpret these as due to the neutron star rotation ( strohmayer 1999 ) .",
    "however , this is not a settled issue .",
    "sax  j1808.4 - 3658 could help resolve this issue because this is the only burster for which a rotation period has been independently determined .",
    "so far , bursts were only detected with the wfcs .",
    "the wfc data from the first detected outburst from sax  j1808.4 - 3658 has recently been revisited , employing higher data coverage and a more mature calibration ( in  t  zand et al .",
    "this resulted in the detection of a third burst which was 50% brighter than the other 2 bursts already published by in  t  zand et al .",
    "( 1998c ) , though with a similar bolometric peak flux , see figure  [ fig1808a ] .",
    "this is the brightest type - i burst detected by wfc among about 1500 cases , and is perhaps the only case for which meaningful searches for burst oscillations in the moderately sensitive wfc data are possible ( note that the photon collecting area for wfc is about 40 times smaller than for rxte s prime instrument ) .    ]",
    "a number of attempts to find a signal at 400 hz resulted in the intriguing power density spectrum presented in figure  [ fig1808b ] .",
    "this is the average spectrum over 80 intervals of 0.25  sec starting at the onset of the burst .",
    "therefore , the frequency resolution is rather broad at 4  hz . at the time of this workshop ,",
    "the significance of this signal is being assessed and the indications are that it is on the edge of being significant .",
    "heise et al .",
    "( 1999 ) reports that seven lmxb transients discovered with the wfcs in this field were faint and that a large subset ( six ) consists of x - ray bursters .",
    "they propose that these transients make up an as yet unrecognized subclass of lmxbs .",
    "we here note eight more transients in the field :    * sax j1712.6 - 3739 is a transient with a measured peak flux of 32 mcrab ( in t zand et al .",
    "it exhibited a burst ( cocchi et al .",
    "1999b ) ; * sax j1752.3 - 3138 was seen only during a burst ( cocchi et al .",
    "the persistent emission was below 6 mcrab at the time of the burst ; * sax j1818.6 - 1703 was a brief transient that was active for a few hours at a peak flux of about 0.2 crab ( in t zand et al .",
    "1998a ) . it did not exhibit bursts . technically speaking this is not necessarily a lmxb but we include this source because it is in this field ; * sax j1819.3 - 2525 ( in t zand et al .",
    "2000b ) was mostly faint except for a few hours when it was seen to be very bright ( 12 crab units ; smith et al .",
    "it is now proven to be a black hole system at a distance between 7.4 and 12.3 kpc ( orosz et al .",
    "2001 ) . despite a companion of early spectral type ,",
    "this transient is more characteristic for a lmxb transient than for a hmxb transient ( presumably because this is a semi - detached binary without a supergiant companion ) ; * xte j1710 - 281 is a faint transient which is active since at least 1998 and showing a lot of variability below 10 mcrab , including eclipses ( markwardt et al .",
    "1999 ) ; * xte j1723 - 376 was a moderately bright transient in early 1999 when it exhibited type - i bursts ( marshall et al .",
    "1999 ) ; * xte j1739 - 285 is a fairly bright transient that stayed on for at least a few weeks ( markwardt et al .",
    "2000a ) ; * xte j1743 - 363 is a faint transient showing variable activity below about 15 mcrab since 1999 ( markwardt et al .",
    "1999 ) .    in total , fifteen faint lmxb transients have been detected , with 9 or 10 of them bursting .",
    "these are not necessarily short transients , as observations have shown of for example sax  j1747.0 - 2853 ( figure  [ fig1747 ] ) and sax  j1712.6 - 3739 ( cocchi et al . , in preparation ) which all are active for at least 200 days .",
    "this broadens the characteristics of the proposed subclass of faint lmxb transients considerably , and we conclude that such a subclass is perhaps not as strictly defined as initially thought .",
    "nevertheless , the bepposax and rxte observations do show that there is a large fraction of likely lmxb transients that do not reach high peak luminosities .",
    "perhaps this is related to a special nature of the companion star .",
    "for instance , the companion star in sax  j1808.4 - 3658 appears to be of very low mass ( @xmath10  m@xmath11 , chakrabarty & morgan 1998 ) .",
    "unfortunately , identifications of optical counterparts of these transients are scarce and difficult in this field , and measurements of orbits through pulsar timing have so far only been possible in sax  j1808.4 - 3658 .",
    "in the last 4 years , monitoring programs by bepposax - wfc and rxte - pca on the galactic center field have helped extend the lmxb population by tens of percents .",
    "most of the new transients are fainter than the classical x - ray novae , and are type - i x - ray bursters .",
    "the frequency of lmxb transients brighter than approximately 10 mcrab in our galaxy is @xmath12 per year .",
    "the percentage of bursters , and therefore confirmed neutron star systems , is about 60% versus about 40% for all lmxb transients .",
    "the higher burster percentage among fainter transients may be a selection effect because low accretion rates are more favorable toward triggering thermonuclear flashes on neutron star surfaces , if present .",
    "therefore , this measurement does not necessarily indicate a higher neutron star to black hole ratio among fainter transients .",
    "the newly found lmxb transients comply fairly well with results from an archival study of 66 outbursts from 24 x - ray novae by chen et al .",
    "the peak luminosity distribution for x - ray novae was shown to range from 0.003 to 5 times the eddington luminosity , peaking at 0.2 @xmath13 which is equivalent to roughly a few tenths of a crab unit if at a distance equal to that of the galactic center .",
    "the author thanks the organization of this workshop for the invitation to give this presentation , john heise and pietro ubertini for allowing a discussion of the wfc program , craig markwardt and jean swank for allowing a discussion of the pca bulge program and providing figures [ figpca1 ] and [ fig1747 ] , and angela bazzano and john heise for careful reading of the manuscript",
