    "as the density decreases and the mushroom regime is approached the two branches become typically comparable in size , and the size distribution is not longer bimodal .",
    "we showed also that a comparable behavior can be obtained for sgp layers grafted onto curved surfaces , with perhaps more adaptability due to the extra available space around the surface .",
    "in particular , this leads to an intermediate grafting density regime where coexist symmetric and asymmetric chain configurations .",
    "we believe that sgp layers represent a completely new type of interfacial polymer structures and as such , open many new possibilities that we have barely considered here .",
    "for instance , we expect the steric forces between sgp layers to be qualitatively different from the usual steric repulsion between grafted polymer layers .",
    "we hope to address this and other related questions in future extensions of our work .",
