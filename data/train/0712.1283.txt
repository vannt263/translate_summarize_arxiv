    "on - the - fly ( otf ) is a technique to perform mapping observations efficiently with single - dish radio telescopes . in otf",
    ", the antenna is driven continuously in a region to be mapped and the data are taken in a short interval , instead of integrating at discrete positions on the sky ( such a conventional `` step - and - integrate '' method is hereafter referred to as _ position - switch _ [ psw ] observation ) .",
    "otf observations have advantages over psw modes as follows : ( 1 ) observing efficiency improves since dead time of the telescope is reduced and a large number ( @xmath1 ) of on - source integrations are made per an emission - free reference integration ; ( 2 ) the system variation ( e.g. , atmospheric conditions , receiver gain , pointing of the telescope ) less affects the map since the entire map can be covered in a short period ; and ( 3 ) since the data are acquired more frequently than the nyquist sampling rate , the spatial information is not lost . comprehensive review and discussion on otf technique",
    "have been made by @xcite .",
    "otf technique has been commonly and widely used in radio continuum observations .",
    "technical limitations , such as fast readout from the spectrometer and dealing with huge data , had prevented otf from being applied to spectral line observations . in the last decade",
    "spectral line otf has been made practicable in some observatories ( e.g. , @xcite ) and is established as an efficient method .",
    "likewise , with the nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) 45-m and atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste : @xcite ) 10-m telescopes , continuum otf observations have already been available .",
    "we enabled the telescopes to be operated in otf observing mode , as reported in this paper .",
    "the otf observing system of the telescopes now works with an array of digital autocorrelation spectrometers ( mac ; @xcite ) .",
    "heterodyne receivers equipped with the telescopes , including the 25-beam focal plane array receiver ( bears : @xcite ) on the 45-m telescope , can be connected to the mac and be available for otf observations .",
    "the capability of otf to obtain a high - quality map efficiently is important in various scientific fields .",
    "for example , investigating how the initial mass function ( imf ) of stars is determined is one of the most important issues in astronomy .",
    "recent studies have suggested that the stellar imf is well related to the mass function ( mf ) of dense molecular cloud cores ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which are sites of star formation . therefore detecting a number of cores in various star forming regions",
    "is needed in order to study the relation between star forming activity and mf or physical / dynamical conditions of the cores . in this case",
    "sensitive unbiased mapping observations of wide fields are required .",
    "in addition , otf data are ideal to be combined with interferometric data , since they preserve spatial information in the ( spatially ) low frequency regime , which is lost via interferometric observations .",
    "thus , the fidelity of high resolution images of , e.g. , molecular cloud cores or external galaxies , taken with interferometers are significantly improved by being combined with otf data .",
    "the fidelity ( preserving total flux ) is essential to various kinds of studies .",
    "for instance , in order to investigate the evolution of the interstellar medium ( formation and destruction of giant molecular cloud associations [ gmas ] ) across spiral arms in external galaxies , it is required to detect not only gmas , which are spatially confined to spiral arms , but also diffuse emission in interarm regions .    in order to make spectral line otf observations available with the nro 45-m and the aste 10-m telescopes ,",
    "various improvements have been applied to the control software system , cosmos-3 @xcite , and related instruments . in particular , fast and synchronized control of instruments and handling of huge amount of data",
    "are the difficulties , as discussed later .",
    "the way to determine optimal observing parameters is also complicated .    in this paper",
    "we report practical information and implementation of the otf observing mode for the telescopes .",
    "basic concepts and parameters of otf observations are introduced in  [ sec : overview ] , followed by a brief description on controls of related instruments in  [ sec : control ] .",
    "requirements on observing parameters , procedures to estimate sensitivity , and how to maximize observing efficiency are explained in  [ sec : parameters ] .",
    "we describe the data reduction process in  [ sec : reduction ] .",
    "desired characteristics of convolution functions to regrid the data onto a map are discussed and some appropriate functions are shown . in  [ sec : verification ] we describe the measurements of driving performance of the antennas , comparison with psw map , and verification of frequency - switch observing mode .",
    "an otf scan pattern is schematically illustrated in fig .  [ fig : scanpat ] . a constant - speed raster scan with a single - beam receiver is assumed . like usual psw observations ,",
    "the standard `` chopper - wheel '' technique @xcite is employed to calibrate the antenna temperature @xmath2 in which the atmospheric and antenna losses are corrected . for the chopper - wheel calibration , a hot load ( r ) at the ambient temperature and blank sky ( sky )",
    "are observed during the observation in an appropriate interval .",
    "data at an emission - free reference position ( off ) are taken before every on - source scan ( on , hereafter simply `` scan '' ) or set of several scans . the off is usually taken by pointing the antenna outside the source .",
    "however it can also be taken by shifting observing _ frequency _ ( see  [ subsubsec : freqsw ] ) .    during the scan",
    "the antenna is driven at a constant speed ( @xmath3 ) on the sky and the data are `` dumped '' from the spectrometer at an interval of @xmath4 .",
    "the `` approach - run '' at a speed @xmath3 is inserted before every scan to let the antenna move stably during the scan .",
    "if there is no off between two scans , a `` transit - run '' ( from the end point of the scan to the start point of the next approach - run ) is inserted .",

    "the time interval between each dump from the spectrometer is @xmath4 .",
    "in otf , spectral data are dumped at short interval ( @xmath15 second ) while the antenna is continuously driven across the sky . consequently the following difficulties arise .",

    ": :    doppler correction of the telescope with respect to a rest frame and    frequency switch ( fsw ) are difficult to be implemented in a    conventional way , since exceedingly rapid control of the frequency is    required .",
    "data production and storage .",
    ": :    high data production rate , caused by the fact that the data are dumped    @xmath16 times more frequently than typical psw    observations , may cause trouble on data storage and reduction process .    in this section",
    "we describe the control system and instruments to resolve these issues .",
    "the control software system of the telescopes is cosmos-3 @xcite .",
    "it is designed to have a three - layer architecture , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cosmos3 ] . the interface with observers is provided in the top layer . in the middle layer , manager and merger exist .",
    "the manager controls the observation by receiving instruction from observers and interacting with local controllers ( lcs ) , which directly control instruments , in the bottom layer .",
    "the merger receives outputs from lcs and produces calibrated data .",
    "the observer can view a quick look ( qlook ) of the data and check if the observation is running properly .",
    "synchronization of instruments with each other is managed with 1 , 10 , 50 , and 100-hz timing pulses , which are generated and distributed from the standard clock system of the observatory .",
    "( 80mm,59mm)figure2.eps      before every approach - run , the antenna lc instructs the antenna to settle on the starting point of the approach - run .",
    "when the antenna is judged to be steady ( the positional error has been within a tolerance for a specified duration ) , the manager decides the timing and coordinates of the following approach - run(s ) , scan(s ) , and transit - run(s ) .",
    "the antenna lc instructs the antenna to follow an ideal scan path at the decided timing .",
    "the ideal coordinates , toward which the antenna is desired to point , is hereafter called prog values . the prog values for every 0.1 second",
    "are calculated and transmitted to the antenna , 0.2 second before it is used .",
    "the antenna manages the timing to use the transmitted coordinates with the 10-hz ( 0.1-second ) timing signal .",
    "two neighboring prog values are linearly interpolated .",
    "the antenna is driven to follow the interpolated positions , referring the 50 and 100-hz timing signals .",
    "meanwhile , the actual pointing of the antenna ( hereafter referred to as real values ) jitters around the prog values .",
    "the amount of the jitter ( @xmath17 ) is measured , in case of the 45-m telescope , using the encoder readout of the master collimator and the pointing deviation between the master collimator and the main reflector . in case of the 10-m telescope ,",
    "the encoder readout of the antenna is used .",
    "the prog ( in both equatorial and horizontal coordinates ) and @xmath17 ( horizontal coordinates ) values are both written onto a file , the _ antenna log _ file , along with time stamps at every 0.1 second .",
    "it is essential to synchronize the timing of data acquisition with that of the antenna driving , particularly in case of otf , since the data dump time is very short .",
    "the timing is managed as follows .",
    "when an observation starts , observing parameters , such as interval of data dumps ( 0.1 second ) and number of datasets to be dumped , are calculated by the manager from instructions made by the observer .",
    "they are sent to the spectrometer lc and then to the spectrometer , in advance of data acquisition .",
    "for each scan , the manager decides the time to start the scan as mentioned above .",
    "the lc is informed of the time , waits until 1 second before it , and then sends a command to the spectrometer to start integration . after receiving it ,",
    "the spectrometer begins to acquire the data , triggered by the next fall - down of the 1-hz , 50%-duty timing pulse .",
    "it dumps the data at every 0.1 second during the scan .",
    "though the spectrometer outputs datasets at every 0.1 second , observers can specify @xmath4 to be @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) seconds to reduce the data size .",
    "every 0.1-second output is transferred to the lc .",
    "the lc averages successive @xmath20 datasets if @xmath21 , and writes them down onto a file ( the _ spectrometer log _ file ) along with time stamps .",
    "when a wide area is mapped , the radial velocity of the telescope ( @xmath22 ) with respect to the reference frame ( e.g. , the local standard of rest [ lsr ] ) significantly changes from point to point : the velocity gradient across the sky plane amounts to roughly @xmath23 ( lsr ) at maximum in nro . in psw observations ,",
    "the radial velocity of the telescope at each position is calculated and the local oscillator ( lo ) frequency is shifted before the integration starts , in order to track the doppler shift caused by @xmath24 .    however , in otf observations , the antenna runs on a scan path ( thus @xmath22 gradually changes ) , and during which the spectral data are continuously taken at a short interval . in this case",
    "it is difficult to track @xmath22 by shifting the lo frequency continuously during the scan .",
    "therefore we do not make any shift on lo frequency during the otf scans .",
    "instead , the doppler correction is carried out by software : in the production process of spectral data ( merger ; see below ) , @xmath22 for each on integration is calculated , and then channel shift operation is made .",
    "when spatially - widespread and/or narrow lines ( e.g. , co in nearby molecular clouds ) are mapped , fsw observing technique has been widely used .",
    "conventional fsw observations with the nro 45-m and aste 10-m telescopes are performed as follows .",
    "the lo frequency is switched between the original value @xmath25 and slightly shifted value @xmath26 .",
    "the switching cycle is in the order of @xmath27 hz , and the frequency throw @xmath28 is typically several mhz .",
    "the averager / integrator of the spectrometer behaves in adding and subtracting mode , synchronized with the frequency shift of the lo , during the on integration ( the averager / integrator does nothing during a margin for the transition of frequency ) .",
    "thus the on concurrently plays a role of off . accordingly the original signal and a negative - amplitude signal appear on the spectrum at a separation of @xmath28 .",
    "the final spectrum is demodulated by invert , shift and add operation .    in otf ,",
    "the difficulty of shifting lo frequency during a short integration again arises .",
    "we have implemented fsw observing mode in otf by shifting the lo frequency at off position only : @xmath25 is used during on , while @xmath26 is used during off . the emission line existing ( if any ) at off position shifts by @xmath28 , thus it can be virtually regarded as emission - free reference .",
    "as described above , the antenna pointings are recorded in the antenna log file at every 0.1 second , and the readouts from the spectrometer are written onto the spectrometer log file at every @xmath18 seconds .",
    "the merger , which is a process to produce spectral data files , runs during the observation ( it can also be executed asynchronously after the observation ) .",
    "the merger process reads the spectrometer log file , calculates the standard chopper - wheel equation to calibrate the antenna temperature , and shifts the resultant spectra along the frequency channels to correct doppler shift .",
    "the merger also reads the antenna log file . by comparing time stamps written in both log files ,",
    "it calculates sky coordinates , toward which the antenna was actually pointed at the moment of each dump , using the prog ( equatorial ) and @xmath17 ( horizontal ) values .",
    "the derived coordinates are written in the header of the spectral data file . in this way",
    "intensity- and velocity - calibrated spectra are written on a file , called the _",
    "raw data _ file .    in practical implementation ,",
    "the trouble with the raw data is their large sizes .",
    "if the 25-beam , 1024-channel data are represented as 32-bit and dumped every 0.1 second , the data rate goes up to @xmath29 ( data headers are neglected ) .",
    "in order to reduce the size of the raw data , the quantization level , @xmath30 [ bit ] , must be as small as possible .",
    "when the peak antenna temperature of the intrinsic spectrum is @xmath31 and rms noise is @xmath32 , observed antenna temperature between the minimum ( @xmath33 ; @xmath34 ) and maximum ( @xmath35 ) is quantized into @xmath36 levels .",
    "the quantization noise is roughly written as @xmath37 . since the noise level increases to @xmath38 ,",
    "the overhead in the observing time ( the ratio between @xmath30-bit and @xmath39-bit cases ) is @xmath40 meaning that the loss increases when the signal - to - noise ratio of individual spectrum , @xmath41 , is high .",
    "supposing an extreme case for the current system : peak antenna temperature @xmath42 $ ] , system noise temperature @xmath43 $ ] , frequency resolution @xmath44 $ ] , and data dump time @xmath45 $ ] , we obtain @xmath46 . for @xmath47 , 12 , and 16 , @xmath48 becomes 0.40 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "we adopted @xmath51 ( 4096 levels ) , for which the quantization noise is practically negligible , resulting in the maximum data rate of @xmath52 .",
    "in addition , the merger supports options of channel trimming and channel binning .",
    "when these options are specified by the observer , the merger trims and/or bins up channels of the spectra before writing them down on the raw data file .",
    "it should be noted that the 12-bit quantization may affect the data in the following situation : bandpass becomes nearly 0 ( i.e. , @xmath2 diverges ) at the band edges , or an extremely intense spurious signal appears .",
    "the observer should pay attention to the obtained spectra through qlook .",
    "this problem can be evaded by trimming the band edges and/or spurious signals , since the data are quantized _",
    "after _ the trim .",
    "as a result of an observation , the mapped region is filled with data points . the data sampling separation is @xmath53 along the scan , @xmath11 across the scan .",
    "@xcite discussed requirements on the sampling , as summarized as follows .",
    "it is requested that , at least , the sampling rates @xmath53 and @xmath11 are both more frequent than the nyquist sampling rate @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the observed wavelength and @xmath56 is the diameter of the antenna aperture . in case of @xmath57 ( 115 ghz )",
    "observations with the 45-m telescope @xmath58 , which corresponds to @xmath59 of the half - power beam width ( hpbw ) .",
    "practically a sampling more frequent than the nyquist rate is required to avoid aliasing noise and beam smearing effects . since the data points do not align on any regular grid due to the antenna jitter etc .",
    ", the data should be regridded onto a regular grid using a gridding convolution function ( gcf ) in the data reduction process ( see  [ sec : reduction ] ) .",
    "we estimate the sensitivity of a single - beam observation .",
    "application to a multi - beam receiver is discussed later .",
    "the total number of scan rows in an observation is @xmath60 .",
    "the total on - source integration time becomes @xmath61 the total time spent to run an observation including r , sky , off , antenna slew , etc .",
    "is estimated to be @xmath62 where @xmath63 is an integration time for an off , and @xmath64 is an overhead of r - sky calibration ( if 1 minute is consumed to obtain r and sky data at every 15 minutes , @xmath65 ) .",
    "the @xmath66 is an overhead time per one scan row , which consists of go - and - return to the off point @xmath67 , time for approach- and transit - run @xmath8 and @xmath10 , thus is written as @xmath68 the @xmath14 depends on the distance between the mapped region and the off position ; @xmath8 and @xmath10 should be chosen so that the antenna follows the prog position during the scans . now",
    "the ratio of on - source time to the total time spent is @xmath69 the total on - source integration time for a map grid point , @xmath70 , is a sum of time during which the beam scans within the grid cell .",
    "since the data are convolved using a gcf to construct a regularly gridded map , effectively a factor @xmath71 is multiplied : @xmath72 the factor @xmath71 is a constant determined by the extent of the used gcf and is calculated as follows .",
    "suppose that observed points @xmath73 are uniformly distributed around the grid point and each point has a spectrum @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) , rms noise temperature @xmath76 , and a gcf weight @xmath77 .",
    "we assume that the on - source integration time @xmath78 and therefore the rms noise temperature @xmath79 of each point are both constant . here",
    "@xmath80 is the system noise temperature , @xmath81 is the frequency resolution of the spectra , and @xmath82 is the quantization efficiency of the spectrometer . in case of mac @xmath83 ; and hereafter @xmath82 is omitted from expressions . the convolved spectrum @xmath84 is written as @xmath85 , and its noise temperature @xmath32 becomes @xmath86 , where @xmath87 .",
    "if we take the grid spacing as the unit of spatial length and redefine @xmath78 as the on - source integration time per unit area ( 1 grid cell ) , summations can be rewritten with integrals : @xmath88 .",
    "approximate values of @xmath71 for gcfs bessel@xmath89gauss , sinc@xmath89gauss , gauss , pillbox , and spheroidal ( see  [ sec : reduction ] ) with default parameters are , respectively , 4.3 , 1.2 , 6.3 , 1.0 , and 10",
    ".    redefining @xmath81 as the frequency resolution of a _ map _ to be made , the noise of the map due to on - source integration is estimated to be @xmath90 the standard radiometer equation . on the other hand , the number of off points used to consist a map grid point is roughly written as @xmath91 ( here the extent of the gcf is neglected ) . thus the effective off integration time for a grid cell is @xmath92 and the noise due to off points becomes @xmath93 therefore the total noise level of the map is written as @xmath94 validity of this equation has been practically confirmed ( see  [ subsec : comparepsw ] ) .      the noise level of a map achieved in unit observing time @xmath95 is written as @xmath96 and is minimized when @xmath63 is optimal : @xmath97 leads to @xmath98 this formula is a generalization of the well - known relation @xmath99 for psw observations , where @xmath20 is the number of ons taken per one off . toward @xmath100 , eq .",

    "if @xmath63 is shorter than the optimal value , @xmath104 dominates the map .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath63 longer than @xmath105 is excessive since the noise level of the map is limited by @xmath106 .",
    "( 80mm,58mm)figure3.eps    using the above notations , it is quantitatively shown how the observing efficiency improves , by adopting appropriate parameters , compared with psw observations .",
    "the following two factors contribute : ( 1 ) the ratio of on - source time to the total time spent , @xmath107 , becomes larger because not only the dead time ( antenna slew , etc . )",
    "is reduced , but also the off integration time is relatively shorter ( @xmath108 ) ; and ( 2 ) in general @xmath109 , thus @xmath110 nearly equals to @xmath106 ( instead of @xmath111 , which is applicable to psw observation with @xmath112 ) . as @xmath100 and @xmath113 , the both factors respectively correspond to reduction of observing time by a factor of 2 .",
