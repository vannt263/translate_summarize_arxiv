    "qubit manipulation in carbon nanotube devices is of interest both for quantum computing  @xcite and for coherent control of nanomechanical states via strong coupling to a spin qubit  @xcite .",
    "the low concentration of nuclear spins in carbon is at first sight promising for spin and valley coherence , but the qubit coherence time observed so far  @xcite has not exceeded 100  ns , well below the expected limit from electron - lattice and spin - orbit coupling  @xcite .",

    "because pat is a resonant effect , the measured width of the absorption line is proportional to the charge dephasing rate . by measuring the frequency and temperature dependence of the pat resonance linewidth",

    "we consider first vibrational dephasing , by analysing the phonon spectrum and dominant coupling mechanisms to the charge state .",
    "we must consider both bending and stretching modes as potential contributors to charge dephasing .",
    "for the former , coupling to the charge state arises from displacement of the quantum dots in the gate electric field , whereas the electron - phonon coupling of longitudinal phonons arises from the deformation potential .",
    "the spectra of bending and stretching phonons are ( neglecting tension ) given by  @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the longitudinal sound velocity and @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the radius and length of the suspended nanotube . estimating @xmath40  nm and using @xmath41  nm results in @xmath42  mhz and @xmath43  ghz for the lowest frequency bending and stretching mode .",
    "the respective electron - phonon couplings for bending and stretching modes are calculated in appendix  [ ap : sd ] : @xmath44 numerical estimates considering the underlying mechanisms  @xcite give @xmath45 ( assuming an electric field @xmath46 based on applied gate voltage and sample geometry , and nanotube mass @xmath47  kg ) , and @xmath48 . in both cases the coupling strength peaks for the lowest frequency mode .",
    "dephasing will thus be dominated by thermally populated low - frequency modes .",
    "contrary to a previous treatment of double dot electron - phonon coupling  @xcite based on the canonical spin - boson model with quasi - continuous spectral density  @xcite , we anticipate that only a small number of modes is relevant in this case , suggesting a different approach is required .",
    "to estimate @xmath29 , we therefore adapt analytically derived rabi - model dephasing rates  @xcite .",
    "these rely upon a perturbative expansion utilising the phase space representation of the oscillators . in our case",
    "the charge dephasing rate due to a single phonon mode @xmath49 with coupling @xmath50 is @xmath51 with @xmath52 being boltzmann s constant , @xmath53 the phonon relaxation rate , and @xmath54 the charge qubit energy splitting .",

    "( [ eq : q ] ) explicitly includes the finite lifetime of the relevant phonon modes , as well as the charge bias and tunneling .",
    "generalisation to multiple modes is straightforward  @xcite but unnecessary here : for the parameters discussed below inclusion of up to 10 modes gives relative changes of less than @xmath55 ( appendix  [ ap : approximation ] ) .",

    "( [ eq : q ] ) for the lowest frequency bending mode , where @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gb ] ) is taken as the fitting parameter .",

    "( [ eq : wnb ] ) presumably reflects tension in the suspended nanotube  @xcite .",
    "the fit yields @xmath59 , in reasonable agreement with the previous estimate given the many uncertainties .",
    "by contrast , the lowest stretching mode [ using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : wns ] ) and ( [ eq : gs ] ) ] leads to dephasing on a timescale approaching seconds [ fig .",
    "3(b)inset ] and can therefore be ruled out .",
    "the calculated @xmath29 shows almost no dependence on @xmath60 in the measured temperature range , consistent with fig .",
    "bearing in mind that eq .",
    "( [ eq : q ] ) relies on a perturbative expansion of electron - phonon coupling , we have checked that full numerical simulations of a single mode rabi model using qutip  @xcite lead to a temperature dependence in the dephasing time that is consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq : q ] )  ( appendix  [ ap : approximation ] ) .",
    "thus , while bending mode phonons may limit @xmath29 above @xmath61  mk , they can not explain the measurements across the entire temperature range due to the strong temperature dependence of the phonon model .",
    "this suggests that at least at low temperatures a different mechanism limiting coherence must be at play .",
    "we therefore next compare with expectations from electrical noise . in this case , the dephasing time is given by @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the root - mean - square detuning noise at frequencies up to the driving frequency  @xcite .",
    "assuming that the noise spectrum is dominated by frequencies below 10  ghz , this is consistent with the data in fig .",
    "3(a ) if @xmath64  mev at low  @xmath30 .",
    "there is no clear expectation for the temperature dependence ; however , in a gaas spin qubit device where dephasing was attributed to thermally activated electrostatic noise , an approximately linear dependence of @xmath29 on @xmath30 was found  @xcite .",
    "this simple model fits the data well [ fig .",
    "3(b ) ] , meaning charge noise can not be excluded as the limit of @xmath29 across the temperature range .",
    "thirdly , we suppose that phonon - mediated dephasing operates in conjunction with some other mechanism , such as temperature - independent charge noise . to model these two mechanisms combining incoherently , we fit the data in fig .  [ fig3](b ) across the entire range with @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the phonon dephasing time given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : q ] ) and @xmath67  ps is a saturation value taken as equal to the measured @xmath29 at 13  mk .",
    "this model also fits the data well with @xmath68 .",
    "finally , we consider that @xmath29 is set by the lifetime of the excited state , limited by tunneling to the leads . because escape from the right dot is not coulomb - blocked [ fig .",
    "2(c ) inset ] , this effect should show no strong temperature dependence , and therefore is not the main limit on  @xmath29 . furthermore , we observe no dependence of @xmath29 on gate voltage tuning , indicating that it is not affected by tunnel barriers as tunneling or cotunneling would be .",
    "in conclusion , we deduce that charge coherence is limited by electrical noise at low temperatures , with a possible contribution from phonons above 50  mk .",
    "because pat spectroscopy gives a direct measurement of the charge dephasing rate , it may shed light on the cause of dephasing for a valley - spin qubit defined in a similar device  @xcite . in that experiment ,",
    "performed at 270  mk , a voltage - dependent spin splitting made the qubit sensitive to electrical noise , which was suggested as the main limit on the decoherence rate .",
    "to explain the measured valley - spin decoherence rate , an rms detuning jitter @xmath69  mev was required . in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , the charge  @xmath29 expected from the same detuning jitter is plotted as a filled circle , and is found to be of the same order of magnitude as measured here .",
    "it is therefore plausible that charge noise was a contributor to the decoherence and dephasing rates measured for that valley - spin qubit  @xcite .",
    "the origin of the noise remains unclear .",
    "the required noise level is far in excess of expectation from our room - temperature electronics .",
    "the fact that the noise is apparently reduced compared with that in ref .",
    "@xcite ( where the nanotube rested on an oxide layer ) suggests a contribution from the substrate .",
    "however , in our device most substrate noise should be screened by the surface gates .",
    "one origin could be electrostatic patch noise on the electrode surfaces , as seen in ion traps  @xcite .",
    "another is possible presence of fluctuating charge traps on the surface of the nanotube itself , either in amorphous carbon deposited during synthesis , or from adsorbed water  @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that , provided other decoherence mechanisms such as magnetic  @xmath70c nuclear impurities can be eliminated , careful control of nanotube synthesis and/or vacuum conditions in the cryostat may enhance both charge and valley - spin coherence in nanotube quantum dots .",

    "each phonon mode with wavevector @xmath83 , angular frequency @xmath84 , and ladder operators @xmath85 is governed by the hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator @xmath86 and the charge - phonon coupling given by @xmath87 here the electron - phonon coupling in each mode is parameterized by @xmath88 .    to estimate @xmath89 we express the oscillator displacement for each wavevector @xmath83 in terms of the ( real - space ) position variable @xmath90 , @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the mass of the nanotube .",

    "the deformation potential associated with these phonons averages to zero around the nanotube circumference  @xcite , so electron - phonon coupling arises mainly from the perpendicular electric field @xmath95 induced by the gates .",

    "allows us obtain an analytical estimate of the ` spin ' coherence time in the presence of one or more oscillator modes .",
    "this is more appropriate than solutions to the canonical spin - boson model , as the discrete oscillator environment is too small to assume short environmental correlations times .",
    "by contrast , the phase space representation technique  @xcite is capable of resolving non - markovian dynamics of combined charge qubit and oscillator(s ) . note that in our case the qubit dephasing will be predominantly caused by oscillator relaxation .",

    ", we can also solve the full dynamics of hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hsb ] ) numerically , for example using a package like qutip  @xcite .",
    "however , rigorously extracting a dephasing time is not straightforward : time traces of the charge qubit s coherence are rich in features over a long time in the relevant parameter regime , leading to a rather messy fourier spectrum .",
