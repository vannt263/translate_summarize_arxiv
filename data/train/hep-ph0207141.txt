    "we present here an interesting simple observation on electric potential confinement .",
    "our conclusions concern the nature of potential models and their relationship to qcd string confinement . in the case of the time component vector ( tcv )",
    "potential we note a remarkable transition in the regge spectroscopy from the leading trajectories with slopes @xmath0 to deep daughter slopes of @xmath1 . in fact , the exact string spectroscopy is found to be embedded in this regime .",
    "the latter slope is characteristic of the nambu - goto qcd string with one fixed end @xcite .",
    "we first discuss some general properties of the spinless salpeter ( ss ) or square root equation . for the linear tcv potential",
    "we then compute the regge structure in the orbitally and radially dominant regimes .",
    "the spinless salpeter equation has long been attractive as a minimal generalization of the non - relativistic schrdinger equations with relativistic kinematics .",
    "its main difficulty is that it involves the square root of a differential operator , sometimes called a pseudo - differential operator , which is difficult to treat analytically .",
    "even so , it is easily implemented numerically .",
    "the introduction of a variational method @xcite allowed straightforward numerical solutions involving square roots and even transcendental functions of operators . in this section",
    "we discuss , though do not prove , the necessity of using the spinless salpeter equation in place of a klein - gordon type equation when dealing with a pure vector potential .",
    "starting from the simple classical lagrangian , @xmath2 describing a particle of mass @xmath3 moving with velocity @xmath4 in a lorentz scalar potential @xmath5 and a lorentz time - component vector potential @xmath6 , we find that the hamiltonian , @xmath7 has a sign ambiguity .",
    "this ambiguity arises from the elimination of the velocity in favor of the momentum @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "the positive sign in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) corresponds to the usual positive energy states and yields the correct non - relativistic limit @xmath10 the squared form of eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) , @xmath11 known as the generalized klein - gordon ( gkg ) equation , behaves quite differently in the cases of a pure vector and a pure scalar potential .",
    "this difference is most easily seen from consideration of the s - wave turning points , where @xmath12 .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) determines the energy as a function of the potentials at the turning points , @xmath13 we show this turning point condition separately for pure scalar and pure vector linear confining potentials in figs .",
    "[ fig : one ] and [ fig : two ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] we see that for the pure scalar case there is no overlap of the positive and negative branches of eq .",
    "( [ eturning ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] , on the other hand , we see that for any @xmath14 in pure tcv linear confinement there are states on both positive and negative branches .",
    "a completely analogous observation @xcite has been made earlier in the context of the dirac equation .    since the gkg equation ( [ gkg ] ) is quadratic and contains both branches of eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) , it can have no normalizable solutions in pure tcv confinement because there is tunneling to the negative energy states , which becomes catastrophic for small quark mass .",
    "this difficulty is the well - known `` klein paradox '' @xcite . on the other hand , the gkg equation with pure scalar confinement does have well defined normalizable solutions because there is no possibility of tunneling to the negative branch .",
    "the spirit of the salpeter equation @xcite is to conserve a definite particle number . to this end ,",
    "energy projection operators are employed to remove the negative energy spectrum and the fermion tcv salpeter equation has normalizable solutions for confined quarks @xcite .",
    "the spinless salpeter equation for tcv confinement achieves the same end more simply by explicitly including only the positive branch of eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) . for p - wave and higher angular momentum states",
    ", we consider the hamiltonian in spherical coordinates , @xmath15 which we obtain from dividing the momentum into radial and angular parts .",
    "the wave equation to be solved is then the eigenvalue problem @xmath16 for the pseudo - differential operator given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : six ] ) with the usual operator replacements .",
    "we have discussed the necessity of using the ss equation instead of the gkg equation with vector confinement . in semi - classical language , the necessity of using the ss equation becomes the necessity of using the turning points given by eq .",
    "( [ eturning ] ) with the positive sign only . in this section",
    "we calculate the semi - classical spectrum of the ss equation with tcv confinement .",
    "we first rewrite the ss equation ( [ eq : six ] ) in terms of dimensionless variables @xmath17 in the case of a massless quark , we have @xmath18 where @xmath19 the dimensionless physical turning points resulting from the ss equation are @xmath20 .",
    "the dimensionless constants @xmath21 are turning points of the gkg equation , but not of the ss equation .    in the regime we are investigating",
    "the angular momentum @xmath22 is limited but the energy @xmath23 is large .",
    "it follows that @xmath24 . to see this",
    ", we note that even for the leading ( circular orbit ) regge trajectory @xmath25 ( see the appendix ) and hence @xmath26 . for fixed @xmath22 and large @xmath23",
    ", @xmath27 becomes small . in this limit",
    "the leading behavior of the roots ( [ roots ] ) is @xmath28    the ss equation may be quantized semi - classically by the usual method @xcite @xmath29 in dimensionless variables ( [ dimless ] ) , the quantization condition ( [ eq : semi1 ] ) becomes @xmath30 the tcv quantization is achieved by integrating eq .",
    "( [ poly ] ) .",
    "the method is quite accurate for all states and becomes exact for states with many nodes in the radial wavefunction .",
    "this is the regime we are particularly interested in .    although the integral of eqs .  ( [ poly ] ) , ( [ semi ] ) can be expressed in terms of elliptic integrals , it is more efficient to approximate the integrand first for small @xmath27 .",
    "the approximation @xmath31\\ ] ] reproduces the exact integrand to better than @xmath32 throughout most of the region of integration , even when @xmath33 .",
    "the accuracy of this approximation is shown graphically in fig .  3 , where we plot both the exact integrand ( [ poly ] ) and the approximation ( [ approxintegrand ] ) for @xmath33 .    with the approximation ( [ approxintegrand ] ) ,",
    "the quantization integral ( [ semi ] ) is relatively easily evaluated . to order @xmath27",
    "we find @xmath34 which immediately leads to the result @xmath35 upon making the langer @xcite correction to take into account the centrifugal singularity , @xmath36 where @xmath22 is now the angular momentum quantum number , we find the final spectroscopic relation @xmath37    the relation ( [ stringregge ] ) is identical to an analytic approximation for highly radially excited qcd string , as well as being an excellent approximation to its exact numerical solution @xcite .",
    "we can nail down our central result that the qcd string spectrum ( [ stringregge ] ) is replicated in the radially dominant regime of the tcv potential by solving the tcv ss equation exactly numerically .",
    "the variational ( galerkin ) method is well suited for solving eigenvalue equations with mixed coordinate and momentum operators .",
    "briefly , the method begins with a complete set of orthogonal states that can be fourier transformed .",
    "the wavefunction is approximated as a superposition of the lowest @xmath38 of those states .",
    "the wave equation transforms into an @xmath39 matrix equation which is then diagonalized .",
    "the accuracy of the resulting eigenvalues and wavefunctions is measured by the dependence on @xmath38 and the dependence of the scale parameter of the basis set .",
    "details can be found in @xcite .",
    "some further considerations of the accuracy of the variational method are presented in @xcite .",
    "the tcv ss equation ( [ eq : six ] ) with @xmath40 can thus be solved for a variety of angular momenta , @xmath41 and radial states , @xmath42 .",
    "the result is depicted in fig .",
    "4 . plotted on this figure",
    "are both the qcd string slope @xmath1 ( solid ) and the usual leading trajectory tcv slope @xmath0 ( dashed ) . in both cases",
    "we start the lines at @xmath43 .",
    "although the leading trajectory ( @xmath44 ) agrees with the dashed prediction , the situation changes as we examine the higher radial excitations . at the larger @xmath45 values ( deep daughters )",
    "we observe that the solid line corresponding to the qcd string slope becomes accurate .    in table  1",
    "we provide the exact and the string solutions for the s - wave radial excitations .",
    "we see now that all aspects of the qcd string result ( [ stringregge ] ) work quite well .",
    "the difference between excitations is accurately two units of @xmath46 and the absolute values of the state energies correspond well to the qcd string to three significant figures .",
    "on occasion , some simple results are quite unexpected",
    ". we did not expect to find the @xmath40 qcd string spectroscopy in a potential model . to summarize our finding ,",
    "we have examined both numerically and analytically the state spectroscopy for a massless quark moving in the time - component vector linear confinement potential . for states with angular momentum",
    "much less than the number of nodes we find the spectrum is exactly that of the qcd string .",
    "the regge slope , radial excitation energy , and the absolute values of the energy ( [ stringregge ] ) are exactly what one expects from the qcd string .",
    "simple results , even surprising ones , usually have simple explanations .",
    "as we have recently pointed out @xcite , the qcd string equations reduce to the spinless salpeter equation with a linear time - component vector potential for the s - wave states .",
    "thus there is a natural physical connection between the two systems .",
    "we can understand this connection simply .",
    "a qcd string corresponds to a constant chromoelectric field in the quark rest frame . in",
    "the limit that the quark is moving radially , the qcd string has no angular momentum .",
    "the total energy of the system becomes @xmath47 in a potential model the field never carries angular momentum .",
    "the potential energy of the quark is linear in the distance from the origin , which is the same as the energy of the string as long as the string is moving radially so that there are no relativistic corrections due to its transverse motion .",
    "the total energy of the quark in a tcv potential , @xmath48 in the limit of vanishing @xmath49 becomes @xmath50 it is thus natural to expect agreement between string and tcv confinement in the radial dominant regime .",
    "the real puzzle is why the regge slope of the qcd string should be the same for both circular and radial motions . on one hand",
    "it is well known from nambu - goto days that the regge slope of a rotating qcd string with one end fixed is @xmath1 .",
    "we have seen that the tcv potential regge slope varies from @xmath0 to @xmath1 as one goes from orbital to radial motion [ see fig .  4 ] .",
    "there is thus no obvious reason why this should not happen with the qcd string .",
    "since the qcd string / tcv potential regge slopes coincide at @xmath1 for nearly radial motions this explains the remarkable uniform regge structure seen previously from numerical solutions of the qcd string @xcite .",
    "this work was supported in part by the us department of energy under contract no .",
    "de - fg02 - 95er40896 .",
    "for completeness we semi - classically quantize the tcv equation for nearly circular orbits ( @xmath51 ) . using the notation of eqs .",
    "( [ dimless][roots ] ) , we consider the orbitally dominant regime . in this case",
    "the turning points @xmath52 and @xmath53 are nearly equal . by eq .",
    "( [ roots ] ) , this occurs exactly at @xmath54 for nearly circular orbits we can expand in @xmath27 and @xmath55 , giving @xmath56    using the quantization condition ( [ semi ] ) , we obtain @xmath57 with @xmath58 . solving for @xmath59 , squaring and dropping the small squared @xmath60 term , we obtain @xmath61 finally , we make the langer @xcite correction @xmath62 and find @xcite @xmath63"
