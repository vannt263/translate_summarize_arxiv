    "x - ray binaries are close binary systems where the compact object accretes matter from a companion star via an accretion disk",
    ". the compact object can be either a neutron star or a black hole , while the companion star is a main sequence one .",
    "the x - ray luminosity is usually generated in the inner accretion disk near to the compact object .",
    "there are two type of x - ray binaries , high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) where the companion star is a o or b star , and low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) where the companion star is a k or m star .",
    "the x - ray binaries are categorised into mainly two classes , transient and persistent , based on their long term x - ray variability .",
    "they have in general two distinct spectral states , a high luminous soft state , which is dominated by a black body like emission , and a low luminous hard state , which is dominated by power - law emission .",
    "they also typically show a third intermediate or transitional state where the x - ray flux is highly variable on time scale of milliseconds to seconds .",
    "the variability is sometimes of a quasi - periodic nature , and are termed as quasi - periodic oscillations , qpos . in particular ,",
    "neutron star lmxbs have millisecond variability and their khz qpos are positioned in definite regions on their colour - colour plots @xcite .",
    "these qpos occur during the soft to hard state transition ( see , eg .",
    "* ) ; and they seem to have no long term correlation with x - ray luminosity @xcite .    important insights into the nature of these oscillations can be obtained by studying the fractional root mean square r.m.s .",
    "amplitude , and phase delay or time - lag as a function of energy which depend on the type of qpo and typically show complex behaviour ( see for review , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the energy dependence of the r.m.s and time - lag contain clues regarding the radiative processes that are involved in the qpo phenomena .",
    "spectral fitting reveals that thermal comptonization is the main radiative mechanism for hard x - ray generation in x - ray binaries . in this process",
    ", the seed photons are comptonized by an hot thermal electron cloud or corona .",
    "the thermal comptonization process is generally characterised by three parameters , the seed photon source temperature @xmath4 , the corona temperature @xmath5 , and the optical depth of the medium @xmath6 or the average number of scattering @xmath7 that a photon would undergo @xcite .",
    "@xmath7 depends on the geometry of the corona and for a given optical depth , it is generally difficult to compute analytically for arbitrary corona shapes .",
    "since the dominant spectral component in x - ray binaries is due to thermal comptonization , the energy dependent r.m.s and time - lag of the qpos may be related to the process .",
    "indeed , the energy dependence of the r.m.s and time - lag for the lower khz qpo can be explained in terms of a thermal comptonization model and moreover , such an analysis can provide estimates of the size and geometry of the corona @xcite . in a more detailed work @xcite studied",
    "the expected energy dependent time lags and r.m.s for different kinds of driving oscillations such as in the seed photon temperature or in the coronal heating rate , while self - consistently incorporating the heating and cooling processes of the medium and the soft photon source .",
    "they showed that the observed soft lag for the lower khz qpo could be obtained only when the driving oscillation is in the heating rate of the corona and if a substantial fraction , @xmath8 of the comptonized photons impinge back into the soft photon source .",
    "however , the quantitative results obtained depends on the the specific time - averaged spectral model used for the analysis . typically in the _ rossi x - ray timing experiment _ ( rxte ) , proportional counter array ( pca ) energy band of 3 - 20 kev , there are two spectral models namely the `` hot '' and `` cold '' seed photon models which are degenerate i.e. they both equally fit the data of neutron star lmxbs @xcite . in , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , we employed both these spectral models to infer the size of the medium and fraction of photons impinging on the soft seed source , @xmath8 for different qpo frequencies of the transient source 4u 1608 - 52 . while both spectral models can explain the r.m.s and time lag as a function of energy , the range of the size of the medium for the hot seed photon model 0.2 - 2.0 kms is significantly different than when the cold seed photon model is used , 1- 10 kms .",
    "moreover , we compared the measured soft lags between two broad energy bands versus khz qpo frequency @xcite with the model predicted ones .",
    "we found that the width of medium l decreases with qpo frequency for the hot - seed model , but there is no such trend in cold - seed one , perhaps because the allowed range of the size is larger .",
    "for both models , we obtained the inferred ranges of l and @xmath8 .",
    "thus , it was shown that while interpreting the time lag of the khz qpo as being due to comptonization , can lead to estimates of the size of the medium , it is necessary to have a reliable time - averaged spectral model to do so .",
    "a generic feature of the analysis was that since the observed time lags are soft , there needs to be a significant fraction , @xmath9 of the comptonizing photons to impinge back into the soft photon source .",
    "while in these earlier works it has been treated as a parameter , in principle , it should be computed for a given geometry . in this work ,",
    "we endeavour to do so , by implementing a monte carlo method to trace the photons as they scatter , escape from the medium and impinge into the soft photon source .",
    "the motivation here is to compute @xmath8 as a function of size and for different simple geometries .",
    "we will then compare the results with the constraints obtained in paper i , to find if any of the geometries are more viable .",
    "we will neglect general relativistic effects and any bulk ( including orbital ) motion of the comptonizing medium .    in the next section ,",
    "we briefly discuss the scheme of the monte carlo method used for the thermal comptonization process . in section 3",
    ", @xmath8 is computed for three different geometries of the comptonizing system and in section 5 , the results are summarised and discuss .",
    "in a monte carlo method a photon is tracked as it enters the comptonizing medium and scatters multiply till it leaves the medium .",
    "the process is repeated for a large number of photons to build up the statistics that would give the emergent spectrum as well as the direction of each outgoing photon .",
    "the technique has been in use for several decades now ( for e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have extensively reviewed the monte carlo method for the thermal comptonization process .",
    "the algorithm used in this work for the monte carlo method in the lab frame has been adopted from their paper and the specific scheme used is from the appendix of @xcite .",
    "since our analysis is in the non - relativistic regime , i , e . the electron temperature , kt@xmath10 and the photon energies considered are @xmath11 m@xmath10c@xmath12 , and that the size of the region is much larger than the scattering length , the diffusion limit is still valid .",
    "thus , we can test the code with the analytical results obtained in this limit including the resultant spectrum from the kompaneets equation @xcite .",
    "we test the code in three stages .",
    "first , we compute the average energy change for a monochromatic photon of frequency @xmath13 scattering once in a thermal medium , kt@xmath10 which is expected to be @xmath14 = ( 4kt@xmath10-h@xmath13)@xmath15 .",
    "we computed this average change in energy of the photon for different temperatures and found it to match with the above expectation .",
    "next , for a spherical geometry we consider the average number of scatterings that a photon will undergo @xmath7 and the scattering number distribution .",
    "for such a spherical shape geometry , one can estimate in the diffusion limit that @xmath7= @xmath16 and the peak of scattering distribution should be around @xmath170.3@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "we find these expected results for the monte carlo code , for e.g , for @xmath6 = 9.2 , @xmath7 was found to be 41.4 , and the peak of the distribution was around 25 .",
    "finally , we compare the output spectra of the code with the analytical ones and find a good match as shown in figure [ mcchk ] . here , the medium temperature is fixed at kt@xmath10 = 3.0 kev .",
    "the points with error - bars are from the monte carlo results while the lines are the analytical solutions of the kompaneets equation in which the ( @xmath19 ) term is equated with @xmath7 .",
    "the curve marked 1 is for the case when the soft photon temperature kt@xmath20 = 0.1 kev and @xmath21 9.2 .",
    "for these values the spectrum around 1 kev should be of a power - law form and that indeed is seen .",
    "the curve marked 3 is for the case when the soft photon temperature kt@xmath20 = 1.0 kev and @xmath7 = 500 . here",
    "the emergent spectrum is a wien peak as expected .",
    "the curve marked 2 is for the case when the soft photon temperature kt@xmath20 = 1.0 kev and @xmath21 9.2 and the monte carlo spectrum matched well the the analytical one .",
    "thus in different regimes of comptonization , the code gives expected results .",
    "@xmath22{sed.pdf } \\end{tabular}\\vspace{-0.3cm}$ ]",
    "as shown in paper 1 , an important parameter that determines the nature of the energy dependent time lag is the fraction of photons impinging back into the soft photon source .",
    "perhaps a more physical quantity is the fraction in terms of photon energy , i.e. @xmath24 , where @xmath25 represents the photons that emerge from the comptonizing medium , while @xmath26 represents those photons which impinge back into the source .",
    "note that this energy weigthed fraction @xmath23 would be close to the photon fraction @xmath27 as long as the emergent spectrum is not highly anisotropic . in other words , @xmath28 as long as the spectral shape of the the photons going into the soft source @xmath26 is not very different from the average emergent spectrum @xmath25 . in this section ,",
    "our aim is to estimate @xmath23 for different geometries using the monte carlo scheme .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the spectra of neutron star lmxbs in the 3 - 20 kev band can be fitted by two degenerate models namely the `` hot '' and `` cold '' seed photon ones .",
    "the best fit spectral parameters for a given model , also vary between different observations . in paper",
    "i , we used spectral parameters for nine representative rxte observations spanning a qpo frequency range of 500 - 900 hz . in this work",
    "we consider two sets of spectral parameters which roughly correspond to the spectra when the qpo frequency is low ( @xmath29 hz and high ( @xmath30 hz ) .",
    "this is done for both the `` hot '' and `` cold '' seed photon models .",
    "table [ spec ] lists the spectral parameters used where the `` hot '' seed photon models are named ia and ib while the spectra corresponding to `` cold '' seed photon model are named iia and iib .",
    "the monte carlo computations have been done for each of these four set of spectral parameters .",

    "the radius of the neutron star is fixed at @xmath31 kms while the size of the shell @xmath32 is taken as a parameter .",
    "although perhaps not physical , we also consider for completeness , the possibility that the comptonizing medium is a hollow shell having a vacant region of size @xmath33 between it and the neutron star ( right panel of figure )    in the monte carlo code , a photon is released from the surface of the neutron star and is tracked till it either escapes or impinges back to the surface .",
    "one expects that the fraction @xmath23 will decrease with increasing @xmath32 since the probability that a photon gets absorbed by the surface decreases .",
    "this is indeed the case as shown in figure [ sseta ] where the left and middle panels show the computed @xmath23 as a function of @xmath32 for the four spectral parameters tabulated in table [ spec ] . for comparison",
    ", the plots also show the range of @xmath8 and @xmath32 for the `` cold '' and `` hot '' seed photon models inferred by the energy dependent r.m.s and time - lag of the khz qpo ( paper i ) .",
    "although the range of @xmath8 and @xmath32 are rather large due to the quality of the data , it is heartening to see that for this geometry the computed @xmath23 fall within this range . if better quality data indicate a smaller @xmath23 then perhaps such a geometry can be ruled out .",
    "naturally , a hollow geometry would lead to lower values of @xmath23 .",

    "we consider a rectangular torus surrounding the spherical neutron star .",
    "the radius of the neutron star is kept fixed at @xmath31 kms .",
    "the gap between the torus and the neutron star @xmath38 is also fixed at a small distance of @xmath39 m following @xcite who estimate that the maximum distance between the star surface and the layer is about @xmath40 m. the width of the torus in the radial direction is taken to be a parameter @xmath41 while its half - height in the vertical direction is @xmath42 .",
    "this geometry allows for two definitions of the optical depth @xmath6 , one along the vertical and other in the radial direction and we do the analysis for both definitions . for the same optical depth defined in either fashion ,",
    "the average number of scatterings @xmath7 is smaller by a factor of @xmath43 than for the spherical shell case studied above .",

    "in fact for the `` cold '' seed photon case @xmath23 is marginally larger than the maximum value obtained in paper i. this seems to suggest that for this case at least , such a disk - corona geometry is unfavourable .",
    "however , given the large uncertainties it is difficult to make concrete statements .",
    "nevertheless , our results show that for such a geometry the value of @xmath23 is expected to be large , more or less independent of the thickness of the corona .",
    "using a monte carlo scheme , we estimate the fraction of comptonized photons that impinge back into the seed photon source @xmath8 for different geometries and spectral parameters relevant to neutron star low mass x - ray binaries .",
    "the primary motivation was that to explain the observed soft lags in khz qpos , one needed to invoke a large value @xmath8 in the range of @xmath58-@xmath59 and it was important to find out if this range can be achieved for any reasonable accretion geometry .",
    "we consider three kinds of geometries for the comptonizing medium which are ( i ) a spherical shell around the neutron star , ( ii ) a boundary layer system where the medium is taken to be a rectangular torus around the star and ( iii ) a corona sandwiching a thin accretion disk .",
    "we consider different sizes for the medium and a range of spectra parameters .",
    "in particular we consider two extreme cases of spectral parameters for the two degenerate spectral models which are called the hot and cold seed photon models .",
    "our basic result is that for a wide range of reasonable sizes and spectral parameters , the values of @xmath23 computed by the monte carlo method lie within @xmath58 to @xmath1 and hence are compatible with the values used by @xcite to explain the soft time lags of the khz qpos . since the range of @xmath8 and size inferred from fitting",
    "the time - lags are rather broad , we can not concretely rule out any of the three geometries considered .",
    "however , it seems that the boundary layer geometry can have @xmath8 values more in line with what is required and the disk - corona geometry produces @xmath8 values which are marginally larger .",
    "our results show that it is possible to constrain the geometry of the system if high quality data for energy dependent time - lags are available .",
    "we look forward to data from the recently launched satellite _",
    "astrosat_@xcite , which might provide such high quality data .",
    "perhaps it would then be warranted to consider other complexities such as the seed photons for the boundary layer case may be produced in the accretion disk rather than the neutron star surface or that the corona on top of the accretion disk maybe in the form of inhomogeneous clumps rather than being a uniform medium .",
    "also , not all the photons that impinge back into the source , will be absorbed and one needs to solve the radiative transfer equations self consistently to find the fraction reflected .",
    "this reflected emission will have light travel time delays which may significantly effect the time - lags between different energy bands .    finally , it is interesting to note that for the geometries considered here a significant fraction of the photons impinge back into soft photon source .",
