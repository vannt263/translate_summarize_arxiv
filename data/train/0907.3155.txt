    "hadron colliders offer an excellent place to look for new quarks , as the top quark discovery  @xcite and its recent observation in single production  @xcite at tevatron evidence . in the near future",
    ", the operation of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) will open a new , yet unexplored mass range for new physics searches , in particular for new quarks heavier than the top . despite the demanding environment ,",
    "new quark searches at lhc will be relatively clean because they can be produced in pairs through strong interactions with a large cross section and , being rather heavy , their signals can be easily distinguished from the large background from top pair production and @xmath17 plus jets .",
    "although the possibility of a fourth standard model ( sm ) sequential generation has not yet been excluded  @xcite and partial wave unitarity allows for fourth generation masses up to 1 tev  @xcite , new quarks heavier than the top are generally expected to be of vector - like nature if they exist .",
    "for example , extra - dimensional models with @xmath18 in the bulk  @xcite predict a tower of charge @xmath4 isosinglets @xmath19 , of which the lightest one can be light and have sizeable mixing with the third generation  @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xmath11 and @xmath12 isodoublets of hypercharges @xmath20 , @xmath21 coupling to the third generation naturally emerge  @xcite in warped models implementing a custodial symmetry to protect the @xmath22 coupling  @xcite .",
    "isosinglets @xmath10 are predicted in grand unification theories based on @xmath23 , one of the most widely studied groups  @xcite , in which one such fermion per family appears in the * 27 * representation .",
    "little higgs models  @xcite also introduce a new @xmath9 isosinglet partner of the top quark which ameliorates the quadratic divergences in the higgs mass .",
    "in general , the new quarks predicted in these sm extensions are expected to couple mainly to the third generation . for generic yukawa matrices and heavy quark mass terms",
    ", it has been shown  @xcite that the mixing of new vector - like quarks is of order @xmath24 , where @xmath25 are the masses of sm and new quarks , respectively . then , unless specific symmetries are imposed on the mass matrices , the large mass hierarchy @xmath26 , @xmath27 favours mixing with the third generation .",
    "additionally , constraints on top couplings are weaker than for the rest of quarks  @xcite so there is more room for mixing also from the experimental side .",
    "note , however , that in some models it is possible to evade direct constraints with cancellations , and have large mixing with the first and second generations compatible with experimental data , see ref .",
    "@xcite .    in case that any new physics is discovered at lhc , as it is hoped",
    ", it will be compulsory to determine its nature . for heavy quarks",
    "this means not only the observation of an event excess or even an invariant mass peak , but the determination of the quark charges and @xmath8 isospin , the investigation of the decay channels and the measurement of their mixing with the sm quarks . in this paper",
    "we address some of these issues .",
    "we study the pair production of vector - like singlets @xmath9 , @xmath10 of charges @xmath4 , @xmath5 and doublets @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 of hypercharges @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath28 , respectively , with quarks @xmath2 , @xmath3 of charges @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "( from now on we will drop the @xmath29 , @xmath30 subscripts . )",
    "we will assume that the new quarks mainly couple to the third generation .",
    "previous literature has also investigated some of these signals in specific final states .",
    "for example , pair production of @xmath0 singlets has been studied in the single lepton final state @xcite , as well as pair production of charge @xmath6 , @xmath5 quarks in @xmath31 , @xmath32 doublets producing like - sign dileptons  @xcite and one charged lepton  @xcite .",
    "singlets coupling to @xmath33 instead of the third generation has already been explored , for example in refs .",
    "@xcite . ] here we will advance beyond previous work by analysing twelve multi - leptonic final states which give evidence for the several decay modes @xmath34 with the aim of model discrimination .",
    "it is well known since some time ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the presence or absence of specific decay modes can characterise the new quarks eventually observed .",
    "here we demonstrate how this could be done in practice .",
    "for example , @xmath0 quarks in a @xmath31 doublet have suppressed decay @xmath35 , so they are not seen in the @xmath36 final state as @xmath0 singlets are .",
    "but they have enhanced @xmath37 decays , so if the higgs boson is light ( as preferred by electroweak precision data ) they give a fairly large and clean @xmath38 signal with one charged lepton and six @xmath14 quarks . on the other hand , @xmath39 can not be distinguished from @xmath40 unless the @xmath14 jet charge is measured , which is very difficult and requires large statistics .",
    "but , apart from different signal branching ratios , @xmath0 quarks are cleanly identified by their characteristic @xmath41 decay , which can be observed in the trilepton final state .",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath1 quarks can both decay into four @xmath17 final states , but in some models the latter also decays @xmath42 producing a sharp peak in a @xmath43 invariant mass distribution , which can be observed in dilepton and trilepton final states ( here and in the following @xmath44 ) . in summary , here it will be shown that the simultaneous study and comparison of several multi - leptonic final states , with the observation of invariant mass peaks in most cases , can establish the identity of the new quarks , if they are observed at lhc .",
    "we remark that model discrimination is somewhat more demanding that evaluating the discovery potential of one s favourite model in some final state . from the technical point of view",
    ", it requires the complete signal generation with all decay channels . for @xmath45 and @xmath46 production",
    "there are in general nine decay modes according to eqs .",
    "( [ ec : decall ] ) .",
    "when the decay of the @xmath17 and @xmath47 bosons ( up to four , depending on the channel ) are included , a plethora of possible final states appears involving multi - lepton signals .",
    "these contributions are all included in our simulations , which take into account the effects of radiation , pile - up and hadronisation , performed by a parton shower monte carlo , and use a fast detector simulation .",
    "sm backgrounds have also to be generated and simulated , including those with huge cross sections such as @xmath17 and @xmath47 production plus jets , which are computationally demanding .",
    "heavy quark pair production gives interesting signals in final states with one , two ( like- and opposite - sign ) , three and four charged leptons .",
    "( five and six lepton final states have too small branching ratios . ) for model discrimination it is very convenient to classify signals not only by lepton multiplicity but by the number of @xmath47 boson `` candidates '' present ( same - flavour opposite - charge lepton pairs with an invariant mass consistent with @xmath48 ) .",
    "for example , the trilepton final state is divided into a sample of events having a @xmath47 candidate ( in which @xmath49 and other signals involving @xmath50 would be found ) and events without @xmath47 candidates ( to which @xmath51 , for instance , would contribute ) . in some cases",
    "the number of @xmath14 jets present is also relevant .",
    "this gives a total of twelve interesting final states to be examined , and for which specific analyses are presented in this paper .",
    "but , even after this final state organisation in terms of charged lepton multiplicity and number of @xmath47 candidates , there are final states where more than one type of quark give interesting signals .",
    "one of such cases is , for the trilepton final state with a @xmath47 candidate , @xmath52 ( the charge conjugate modes are also understood ) . in these cases ,",
    "a likelihood classification is performed to separate and identify the @xmath45 and @xmath46 signals , and reconstruct them accordingly .",
    "this approach is unavoidable , since in some models like the @xmath32 doublet both signals can be present .    besides model discrimination , which is the main goal of this paper , the systematic study of all interesting final states offers several advantages .",
    "one of them is that the most sensitive ones can be identified .",
    "we find that the single lepton final state ( with either two or four @xmath14-tagged jets ) offers the best discovery potential for all the models studied .",
    "for quark masses of 500 gev , @xmath15 significance could be achieved for integrated luminosities ranging from 0.16 fb@xmath16  for a @xmath31 doublet to 1.9 fb@xmath16  for a @xmath1 singlet .",
    "our study also provides a guide of final state signatures to be searched in case that an event excess is identified in one of them .",
    "this complements previous work done for the characterisation and discrimination of seesaw models  @xcite and new heavy leptons  @xcite .",
    "the structure of the rest of this paper is the following . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we introduce the models studied giving the relevant lagrangian terms . in section  [ sec:3 ]",
    "we discuss the general features of heavy quark pair production at lhc , and some details associated to the signal and background generation . in sections  [ sec:4l][sec:1l ] the results for final states with four , three , two ( like - sign and opposite - sign ) and one charged lepton are presented , respectively . for the reader",
    "s convenience , the main results obtained are summarised at the end of each section , so that in a first reading the details can be omitted . section  [ sec : summ ] is a general summary where we address model discrimination by comparing signals in different final states .",
    "our conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the feynman rules used in our monte carlo programs are given in the appendix .",
    "in this section we briefly review the electroweak interactions of the new quarks , which determine their decay modes and single production .",

    ", the @xmath1 quark would appear as a sharp peak in a @xmath147 invariant mass distribution in the @xmath141 ( @xmath47 ) final state .",
    "this would determine the quark charge , and would be confirmed by an opposite - sign dilepton signal .",
    "the evidence for the @xmath148 decay comes from the same trilepton final state , and the charged lepton distribution in the top semileptonic decays would in principle probe the chirality of the @xmath88 coupling , but the statistics is smaller than for @xmath0 quarks . indirectly , evidence for the @xmath148 decay results from the presence of @xmath141 ( no @xmath47 ) and @xmath149 signals , also observable with small luminosity .    a @xmath1 quark in the @xmath144 model",

    "an indirect indication of the quark identity , in comparison with a charge @xmath6 quark @xmath2 , would be given by the absence of the reconstructed mass peaks and endpoints which are present for @xmath150 production .",
    "signals in the @xmath151 ( no @xmath47 ) final state are also interesting , not only because of the good discovery potential but also because the mass reconstruction is possible in the hadronic decay @xmath152 ( or the charge conjugate ) with a moderate luminosity .",
    "this mass reconstruction is important because in this model the @xmath1 quark does not have decays @xmath42 and thus trilepton and opposite - sign dilepton signals with a @xmath47 candidate are absent ( see the paragraph above ) .",
    "single lepton signals with four @xmath14-tagged jets , which are very significant for other models , are also absent for the @xmath1 quark in this model but can be produced by its @xmath0 partner and are kinematically not very different .    a @xmath1 quark in a @xmath53 doublet : it does not give trilepton signals without a @xmath47 candidate nor like - sign dilepton ones . on the other hand , it gives large opposite - sign dilepton signals with a @xmath47 candidate with a sharp peak in the @xmath147 invariant mass distribution , from which the quark charge is determined . with",
    "five times more luminosity , this is also done in the four lepton final state with two @xmath47 candidates .",

    "the mass could also be determined from the trilepton final state with an endpoint analysis to confirm the quark identity .",
    "a signal due to this quark should also be visible in the four lepton final state without @xmath47 candidates .    a charge @xmath7 quark @xmath3 : it would be discovered in the single lepton final state with two @xmath14 jets",
    ". the peaks in the @xmath136 invariant mass distributions would give evidence of the charged current decay and indirect evidence of its nature : the signal is three times larger than for a @xmath0 singlet , for example .",
    "a clean signal in the @xmath151 ( no @xmath47 ) final state would also be visible , larger than for a @xmath0 quark . on the other hand , all the signals characteristic of a @xmath41 decay",
    "would be absent , in the trilepton and dilepton final states with a @xmath47 candidate , for example .    in more complicated scenarios with several singlets or doublets",
    "the signals would add up but it still would be possible to identify the new quarks with a thorough examination of all final states .",
    "for example , with a @xmath0 singlet plus a @xmath31 doublet in which both charge @xmath4 quarks have similar masses ( which can not be experimentally resolved ) , the @xmath35 decay would be seen in the single lepton final state , and the dilepton and trilepton signals involving @xmath41 would be much larger than the ones corresponding to just one @xmath0 quark .",
    "of course , the @xmath2 member of the doublet would also be detected .",
    "the same argument applies to a combination of a @xmath1 singlet and a @xmath53 doublet .",
    "the simplest discrimination between @xmath0 , @xmath1 singlets and the @xmath0 , @xmath1 quarks in the @xmath134 model is by the presence of two partners almost degenerate in mass .",
    "still , one may imagine a situation in which a @xmath0 and a @xmath1 singlet almost degenerate were present .",
    "this scenario would be distinguished from the @xmath134 model with the analysis of angular distributions , especially for @xmath41 decays .",
    "the discrimination of vector - like singlets and doublets from a fourth sequential generation with new quarks @xmath154 , @xmath155 is also easy , because the latter would give different signatures ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "oblique corrections prefer a mass difference @xmath156 gev  @xcite , so the @xmath154 quark would decay either @xmath157 ( as a @xmath0 or @xmath3 ) or @xmath158 if the mass difference is larger . in the first case , the absence of @xmath159 would distinguish it from a @xmath0 singlet , and the absence of a degenerate @xmath1 partner from a @xmath53 doublet . in the second case , the decay between new heavy quarks would prove the non - singlet nature of both .",
    "regarding the @xmath155 quark , for @xmath160 the decay @xmath161 would dominate , distinguishing this quark from a @xmath1 singlet in either model . the discovery potential for fourth generation quarks  @xcite is similar to the models studied here .    to summarise , the analyses carried out in this paper show that the single lepton final state offers the best discovery potential , and is the one in which new vector - like quark signals would be first seen .",
    "searches in the dilepton and trilepton channels would soon confirm a possible discovery , and with a luminosity around five times larger all the decay modes of the new quarks would be observed in these channels , establishing the nature of the new quarks . in some models",
    "four lepton signals could be sizeable and detectable as well and , in any case , these should be investigated as a further test of the models .",
    "in this work we have investigated in detail the lhc discovery potential for pair production of new vector - like quarks in five models : @xmath0 or @xmath1 singlets of charge @xmath4 , @xmath5 respectively , and @xmath32 , @xmath31 , @xmath53 doublets of hypercharge @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath28 , restricting ourselves to the case that new quarks mainly couple to the third generation , as it is expected from the sm quark mass hierarchy . in the case of @xmath32 doublets",
    "we have distinguished two scenarios : that both heavy quarks have similar mixing with the top and bottom quark ( model @xmath134 ) and that the mixing of the top with its heavy partner is much larger than for the bottom quark ( model @xmath144 ) , as expected from the mass hierarchy @xmath114 and from indirect precision data .",
    "using a dedicated monte carlo generator protos @xcite we have computed all signal contrubutions involving all heavy quark , gauge and higgs boson decay channels . with a fast detector simulation of signals and backgrounds",
    "we have examined twelve final states which would give evidence of the presence of new quarks , with one to four charged leptons in different kinematical regions and several @xmath14 jet multiplicities .",
    "we have identified the final state with one charged lepton plus two or four @xmath14 jets as the most sensitive one for new quark searches .",
    "nevertheless , model discrimination requires the observation or exclusion of the different heavy quark decay channels . to achieve this goal , the dilepton and trilepton final states are essential .",
    "these final states have also good sensitivity to heavy quark signals , and with a luminosity at most five times larger than in the single lepton channel the @xmath15 observation would be possible and the heavy quarks might be identified .",
    "the reconstruction of mass peaks would also be possible when a sufficient number of events is collected . in our simulations",
    "we have taken heavy quark masses of 500 gev , focusing on early discoveries at lhc .",
    "we have obtained an excellent discovery potential for all models : 0.70 and 1.9 fb@xmath16  for @xmath0 and @xmath1 singlets , respectively ; 0.25 and 0.16 fb@xmath16  for the @xmath134 and @xmath144 models ; and 0.16 , 0.18 fb@xmath16  for the @xmath31 and @xmath53 doublets .",
    "it is also interesting to know the mass reach for higher integrated luminosities . with a simple rescaling",
    "it can be seen that in the single lepton channel alone and a luminosity of 100 fb@xmath16  heavy @xmath0 , @xmath1 singlets with masses up to 800 and 720 gev respectively can be discovered with @xmath15 significance , while for the doublets the reach is higher : 850 gev and 900 gev for the @xmath32 doublet in the two scenarios considered , 900 gev for @xmath31 and 820 gev for @xmath53 . for higher masses the experimental detection of heavy quarks",
    "can also be done using jet mass measurements  @xcite but model discrimination would follow similar strategies as outlined here .    we have also obtained an excellent potential for the discovery of the new quarks in decay channels containing a higgs boson , especially in the final state with one charged lepton and four @xmath14-tagged jets . for heavy quark masses of 500 gev , the discovery luminosities are 0.16 fb@xmath16  for the @xmath144 and @xmath31 models , 0.25 fb@xmath16  for @xmath134 and 0.70 , 1.9 fb@xmath16  for @xmath0 and @xmath1 singlets , respectively .",
    "these luminosities are much smaller than the ones required for a light higgs discovery in the sm .",
    "indeed , it is well known since some time  @xcite that vector - like quark production can be a copious source of higgs bosons and , if such quarks exist and the higgs boson is light , its discovery would possibly happen in one of these channels . for a heavier higgs with",
    "different decay modes the analyses presented here ( relying on the leading decay @xmath162 ) must be modified accordingly .",
    "nevertheless , the determination of the other modes like @xmath163 , @xmath41 , etc . would still be done in the same way as presented here , with few modifications .    in the summaries given at the end of each section",
    "we have compared the multi - lepton signals produced by new quarks with those arising from heavy leptons .",
    "both possibilities for new fermions are easily distinguished by the different reconstructed mass peaks and the common presence of @xmath14 jets for quarks , which in lepton pair production only result from @xmath162 , @xmath164 decays .",
    "interestingly , a more general difference among models introducing new quarks and leptons is that the latter give signals which are more `` multi - leptonic '' : for heavy leptons the trilepton signatures are usually the ones with the highest significance , while for heavy quarks the single lepton one is the most sensitive .",
    "this is not unexpected , since heavy lepton decays give sm leptons plus a gauge or higgs boson , while heavy quarks give sm quarks instead . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model where squark and gluino pair production is large , it is also found  @xcite that , although multi - lepton signatures are important , the final state with best discovery potential is the one with a charged lepton or large missing energy plus jets .",
    "finally , it is worth pointing out that , although in this work we have restricted ourselves to heavy quark pair production , electroweak single production can also have a large cross section depending on the mass and couplings of the new quarks .",
    "these interesting processes are the only ones in which the heavy quark mixing with the sm sector can be measured because the pair production cross section is determined by the heavy quark mass alone and the heavy quark total width is likely to be very difficult to measure .",
    "further model discrimination is also possible in single production , in particular from the study of cross sections and angular asymmetries , and it will be addressed elsewhere .",
