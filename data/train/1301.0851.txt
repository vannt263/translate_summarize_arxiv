    "the born  infeld electromagnetic theory @xcite was introduced in order to avoid the infinite self energy of a charged point particle , which constitutes a well known problem within maxwell electrodynamics , and it is the only non  linear theory without birefringence .",
    "maxwell and born  infeld theories have electric  magnetic duality invariance @xcite , a property not shared with other electromagnetic theories .",
    "recently , the born  infeld electrodynamics has received considerable attention as it can be obtained as a low energy limit of string theory , which at present constitutes the main candidate for a unified theory .",
    "the spherically symmetric solution of einstein gravity coupled to born  infeld electrodynamics corresponds to a charged black hole @xcite .",
    "the solution in @xmath1 dimensions @xcite also represents a black hole which is singular at the origin , where the ricci scalar and the ricci square diverge .",
    "the metric is regular everywhere , and is given by ds^2=-f(r)dt^2+f^-1(r)dr^2+r^2d^2,[1 ] where the function @xmath2 has the form f(r)= -m++ r--2q^2.[1f ] the dimensionless constants @xmath3 and @xmath4 are identified as the adm mass and the charge , @xmath5 is the cosmological constant with dimensions @xmath6^{-2}$ ] , and @xmath7 is the born  infeld parameter ; @xmath7 has dimensions of length , and therefore those of the inverse of the field strength .",
    "the limit @xmath8 corresponds to maxwell linear electrodynamics ; in this limit the well known static btz solution with charge @xcite is recovered , and we simply have @xmath9 .",
    "the spacetime geometry of the btz black hole has constant negative curvature and it is , locally , that of anti  de sitter ( ads ) space ; it only differs from anti  de sitter in its global properties .",
    "this feature makes the btz solution of great interest within the framework of the ads / cft correspondence . in the geometry defined by eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 1f ] ) , the radii @xmath10 and @xmath11 are related by @xmath12 , and are associated to the zero of the electrostatic potential @xmath13 in each theory .",
    "we will assume that the cosmological constant @xmath14 is negative ( i.e. @xmath15 ) , so that in the case of a vanishing charge the geometry is asymptotically anti - desitter .",
    "for suitable values of the other parameters , this choice makes possible a standard horizon structure @xcite , in which the metric function is always positive beyond a certain radius ( different for each theory ) .    thin layers of matter naturally appear in the context of general relativity and cosmology .",
    "for instance , they can be used to model the gravitational collapse to a black hole , and also for the study of the evolution of bubbles and domain walls in a cosmological setting .",
    "spherically symmetric shells around vacuum ( bubbles ) , around black holes and stars , and also being the throat of traversable wormholes , have been extensively studied @xcite ; these shells have also been considered in more than four dimensions @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of collapsing shells in three spacetime dimensions has been presented and applied to several examples in refs .",
    "@xcite . besides , shells in a three dimensional background within einstein ",
    "maxwell theory have been associated to thin - shell wormholes @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "we have recently analyzed the problem in the four dimensional case for einstein gravity coupled to born  infeld electrodynamics in relation with thin - shell wormholes @xcite and shells around vacuum or around black holes @xcite .",
    "the current interest in @xmath0-dimensional einstein  maxwell and einstein  born  infeld black holes , leads to address the related problem of the behavior of thin layers associated with them . in the present article , we study the characterization and the linearized stability under perturbations preserving the symmetry of circular charged shells around black holes ; as a particular case , we also analyze shells around vacuum .",
    "we mathematically build the shells starting from two black hole geometries with a negative cosmological constant , given by eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 1f ] ) .",
    "we apply the well known cut and paste procedure ; we work under the condition that the resulting shell is constituted by normal matter , that is , by matter satisfying the energy conditions .",
    "we set the units so that @xmath16 .",
    "to define a shell ( more precisely a ring ) of radius @xmath17 we take two geometries of the form ( [ 1 ] ) with different metric functions @xmath18 and different coordinates @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and we remove the outer region @xmath21 of one of them and the inner region @xmath22 of the other one .",
    "then , we join the resulting manifolds at @xmath23 to form a new one . for a shell surrounding a black hole , the radius @xmath17 is chosen beyond the largest horizon radius of the inner geometry and also @xmath17 should be large enough to remove the horizons ( if any ) of the outer geometry . in the case of a shell around vacuum ,",
    "the first restriction is no longer needed .",
    "the new complete spacetime in general includes a @xmath24 dimensional matter shell at @xmath25 ; this implies that the metric of the complete geometry , though continuous everywhere , must have discontinuous derivatives .",
    "more precisely , at the shell radius @xmath23 the line element satisfies @xmath26 , while the derivatives of the metric at both sides of the @xmath24 dimensional surface @xmath25 are related with the surface energy - momentum tensor @xmath27 by the lanczos equations @xcite 8s_i^j=-[k_i^j]+_i^j[k ] where @xmath28 is the extrinsic curvature tensor , @xmath29 stands for its trace , and the brackets denote the jump of a given quantity across the circumference @xmath25 .",
    "we let the radius @xmath17 to be a function of the proper time @xmath30 on the ring .",
    "then the components of the extrinsic curvature tensor are given by ^1,2=- , ^1,2= , where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath31 and a dot stands for @xmath32 .",
    "the surface energy density @xmath33 and the pressure @xmath34 are given by = -+ , p=- .",
    "the energy and pressure for a static ( @xmath35 ) ring read _ 0=-+ , p_0=- .",
    "a static shell of normal ( i.e. non exotic ) matter satisfies the weak energy condition , i.e. @xmath36 and @xmath37 ; this implies @xmath38 . with some changes ,",
    "the cut and paste procedure can be used to construct a wormhole geometry ; in this case , both terms in the expressions for @xmath39 and @xmath40 will have the same sign . then , the weak energy condition can not be fulfilled because the joining of two exterior regions @xmath41 with metrics given by @xmath42 and @xmath43 would give @xmath44 . in our study of bubbles or shells around black holes",
    ", we will work under the assumption of normal matter .",
    "from the lanczos equations , we can obtain an equation for the evolution of the shell radius in the form analogous to the energy conservation for a point particle restricted to a motion in only one spatial dimension . squaring twice the expression for the energy density and after some algebra we obtain ^2+v(a)=0[mal ]",
    ", where the potential @xmath45 has the form v(a)=-^2 - 4a(a ) ^2.[pot ] the energy and pressure satisfy the conservation equation ( a)+p=0 , which leads to =-(+p ) . if an equation of state @xmath46 is given , this can be integrated to obtain the energy density as a function of the ring radius by inverting the resulting relation a=-+c.[sol1 ] then @xmath47 can be substituted in @xmath45 and this would allow , in principle , to obtain the time evolution of the ring radius .",
    "we are interested in a perturbative treatment of the dynamics , more precisely , the stability of static solutions . because of the analogy with the problem of a point particle in a one dimensional potential ,",
    "the analysis is straightforwardly carried out in terms of the sign of the second derivative of the potential @xmath45 at an equilibrium configuration given by @xmath35 .",
    "we introduce the definitions s(a)= , r(a)= , m(a)=2a .",
    "this allows to write the potential as v(a)=s--4 m^2 .",
    "a static configuration @xmath35 implies @xmath48 , equilibrium requires @xmath49 , and the condition for stability is that @xmath50 .",
    "the first and second derivatives of the potential read v(a_0)=s-^2--8mm , @xmath51 in the perturbative treatment , only the first derivative of the pressure at the equilibrium position is involved in the dynamics .",
    "second derivatives of @xmath52 and of @xmath53 can be expressed in terms of first derivatives by recalling the conservation equation @xmath54 and introducing the parameter which relates the derivatives of the pressure and energy density at the equilibrium radius @xmath55 ; in the case @xmath56 this parameter can be understood as the speed of sound along the ring . with this definition",
    "we have m=-m- ,",
    " = + m- . then taking into account that @xmath49 and defining the auxiliary functions x(a_0)=s--",
    ", y(a_0)=s-^2+rr--^2 , z(a_0)=-m++m- , the stability condition for a static equilibrium configuration takes the concise form z(a_0)<y(a_0)-8x^2(a_0).[sta ] because we are interested in the study of bubbles and rings around black holes ( not in thin - shell wormholes ) , the additional condition of normal matter must be imposed . the natural way to understand the results",
    "is then to present the stability regions by drawing the intersection of the relation ( [ sta ] ) and the inequalities @xmath57 for different values of the parameters .    , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 ; the critical values of the charge are @xmath61 and @xmath62.,width=604 ]    , @xmath63 , @xmath59 , @xmath64 ; the critical value of the charge is @xmath65.,width=453 ]    , @xmath66 , @xmath59 , @xmath67.,width=604 ]",
    ". the values of the parameters are @xmath68 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 ; the critical values of the charge are @xmath69 and @xmath70.,width=604 ]    .",
    "the values of the parameters are @xmath68 , @xmath71 , @xmath59 , @xmath72 ; the critical value of the charge is @xmath73.,width=453 ]    .",
    "the values of the parameters are @xmath68 , @xmath66 , @xmath59 , @xmath67.,width=604 ]    in the case of shells around black holes in einstein  born  infeld theory ,",
    "we fix the scale with the choice of the cosmological constant ; the inner metric corresponds to non charged black holes ( @xmath59 ) with different masses , thus the ring charge is simply the charge associated to the exterior metric .",
    "we first consider the limit @xmath8 , which corresponds to maxwell electrodynamics .",
    "the values of the masses and charges of the exterior metrics are shown in figs .",
    "1 to 3 . for low values of the mass @xmath74 , two critical values of the charge @xmath75 exist : @xmath76 and @xmath77 are such that for a charge under @xmath76 and for a charge beyond @xmath77 there is an event horizon in the original outer metric , while for @xmath78 it presents a naked singularity . for a certain value of the mass , the critical values of the charge fuse into one , and",
    "beyond that an event horizon always exists in the original exterior metric for any value of the charge . in the complete manifold , the features of the outer original metric , i. e. its horizon structure , determine the behavior ( range , location and shape ) of the stability regions in parameter space as the charge increases .",
    "in particular , only in the case in which the horizon of the original metric is lost , stability could be possible for vanishing or negative @xmath79 . in all cases",
    "a vanishing charge makes stability compatible only with @xmath80 . figs .",
    "1 to 3 illustrate the behavior of the stability regions with an increase of the charge , for a fixed value of the cosmological constant and three different values of the mass .",
    "the main difference with the results for the four dimensional case @xcite is that in three dimensions the evolution of the regions is not monotonous : as the considered charge becomes larger , so that the original outer geometry has an event horizon , the stability regions recover the same form of those corresponding to low values of the charge .    in the case of einstein gravity",
    "coupled to born  infeld non linear electrodynamics , the departure from standard maxwell theory is determined by the parameter @xmath7 , which can be taken non negative without losing generality .",
    "the stability study is performed in terms of the dimensionless quantity @xmath81 .",
    "as before , we consider charged shells around @xmath0-dimensional non charged black holes ; the results are shown in figs .",
    "the behavior of the original outer metric with the charge is analogous to that of the maxwell case ; however , for all other parameters fixed , the difference between the values of the two critical charges is smaller in born  infeld electrodynamics .",
    "more precisely : for a given value of @xmath81 , the difference between @xmath77 and @xmath82 decreases as the mass @xmath74 is enlarged , while for a given value of @xmath74 this difference becomes smaller as a larger @xmath81 is chosen .",
    "this is reflected in the evolution of the shape and size of the stability regions as functions of the parameters .",
    "we display only the results corresponding to @xmath83 .",
    "the plots show that the region such that smaller positive and also negative values of @xmath79 are compatible with stability is reduced and finally disappears as the mass @xmath74 is taken larger .",
    "another point to be noted is that , for charges near the critical ones , the stability regions for the same values of @xmath84 are in general slightly larger in the case of born  infeld electrodynamics , making stability compatible with lower values of the parameter @xmath79 .    as a particular case",
    ", we can study bubbles rings around vacuum by taking the inner black hole mass @xmath85 equal to zero .",
    "this can be done for both maxwell and born  infeld theories . within both theoretical frameworks",
    "the results are very similar to those corresponding to rings around black holes , so figures are not included .",
    "however , the numerical analysis shows that , in general , for the same values of the ring charge , rings around black holes admit slightly larger stability regions , associated to smaller possible values of the parameter @xmath79 , than rings around vacuum .",
    "we have constructed charged rings around @xmath0-dimensional non charged black holes within the framework of einstein  born  infeld theory , and we have studied their stability under linearized radial perturbations . the einstein ",
    "maxwell case corresponds to the limit in which the born  infeld parameter @xmath7 is zero .",
    "we have found that , for fixed @xmath86 and taking a given @xmath81 , for low values of the mass @xmath74 of the outer metric , there are two critical values of the charge such that the stability regions are larger for charges between them ; these critical charges are no longer present for large values of the mass @xmath74 , and the stability regions are smaller in this case .",
    "there are ranges of the parameters for which the stability regions include the physically more interesting case @xmath87 , so @xmath88 can be understood as the velocity of sound on the shell . for fixed @xmath74 ,",
    "the critical values of charge get closer to each other as @xmath81 grows , reducing the range of charge corresponding to larger stability regions .",
    "we have also considered the particular case of bubbles , that is , charged rings around vacuum . though not displayed , the numerical results show that , for fixed values of the parameters , the stability regions of rings around vacuum are slightly smaller than those of rings around black holes , in the sense that stiffer matter is needed .",
