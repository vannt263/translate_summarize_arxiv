    "the theoretical investigation on the properties of compact stellar objects in presence of strong quantizing magnetic field have gotten a new life after the discovery of a large number of magnetars @xcite .",
    "these exotic stellar objects are believed to be strongly magnetized young neutron stars .",
    "their surface magnetic fields are observed to be @xmath0 g .",
    "then it is quite possible that the fields at the core region may go up to @xmath1 g ( the theoretical estimate may easily be obtained from scalar virial theorem ) .",
    "the exact source of such strong magnetic field is of course yet to be known .",
    "these objects are also supposed to be the possible sources of anomalous x - ray and soft gamma emissions ( axp and sgr ) .",
    "now , if the magnetic field is really so strong , specially at the core region , it must affect most of the important physical properties of these stellar objects and also some of the physical processes , e.g. , the rates / cross - sections of elementary processes .",
    "in particular the weak and the electromagnetic decays / reactions taking place at the core region will change significantly .",
    "the strong magnetic field affects the equation of state of dense neutron star matter . as a consequence the gross - properties of neutron stars @xcite , e.g. , mass - radius relation , moment of inertia , rotational frequency etc .",
    "should change significantly . in some recent work we have developed the relativistic version of landau theory of fermi liquid in presence of strong quantizing magnetic field to obtain the equation of state of dense neutron star matter @xcite",
    "we have also shown that the nucleons acquire complex mass in the @xmath2 meson exchange type mean field in presence of strong magnetic field .",
    "it has been noticed that due to the complex nature of neutron and proton energies , there is a kind of relaxation or oscillation in the iso - spin space . in the case of compact neutron stars ,",
    "the phase transition from neutron matter to quark matter , which may occur at the core region , is also affected by strong quantizing magnetic field .",
    "it has been shown that a first order phase transition initiated by the nucleation of quark matter droplets is absolutely forbidden if the magnetic field strength @xmath3 g at the core region @xcite . however , a second order phase transition is allowed , provided the magnetic field strength @xmath4 g .",
    "this is of course too high to achieve at the core region .",
    "the study of time evolution of nascent quark matter , produced at the core region through some higher order phase transition , shows that in presence of strong magnetic field it is absolutely impossible to achieve chemical equilibrium ( @xmath5-equilibrium ) configuration among the constituents of the quark phase if the magnetic field strength is as low as @xmath6 .    the elementary processes , in particular , the weak and the electromagnetic decays / reactions taking place at the core region of a neutron star are strongly affected by such ultra - strong magnetic fields @xcite . since the cooling of neutron stars are mainly controlled by neutrino / anti - neutrino emissions",
    ", the presence of strong quantizing magnetic field should affect the thermal history of strongly magnetized neutron stars .",
    "further , the electrical conductivity of neutron star matter , which mainly comes from free electron gas within the stars and directly controlls the evolution of neutron star magnetic field , should also change significantly @xcite .    in another kind of work , the structural stability of such strongly magnetized rotating objects are studied .",
    "it has been observed from the detailed general relativistic calculation that there are possibility of some form of geometrical deformation of these strongly magnetized objects from their usual spherical shapes @xcite . in the extreme case",
    "such objects may either become black strings or black disks .",
    "it is quite possible to have gravity wave emission from these rotating magnetically deformed objects ( see also @xcite for the magnetic deformation of nucleonic bags in neutron star matter ) .    in a recent study of the microscopic model of dense neutron star matter , it has been observed that if most of the electrons occupy the zeroth landau level , with spin anti - parallel to the direction of magnetic field , and only a few are with spin along the direction of magnetic field with non - zero landau quantum number , then either such strongly magnetized system can not exist or such a strong magnetic field can not be realized at the core region of a neutron star @xcite .",
    "we have observed that @xmath7 g is the upper limit of magnetic field which the core of a neutron star can sustain .",
    "we have also noticed that since the electrical conductivity of the medium becomes extremely low in presence of ultra - strong magnetic field , the magnetic field at the core region must therefore decay very rapidly .",
    "hence it may be argued that the magnetic field at the core of a magnetar can not be too high , it is only the strong surface field which has been observed .",
    "similar to the study of quark - hadron deconfinement transition inside neutron star core in presence of strong quantizing magnetic field , a lot of investigations have also been done on the effect of ultra - strong magnetic field on chiral properties of dense quark matter @xcite ( see also @xcite for the chiral properties of strongly magnetized electron gas ) .",
    "the strong external magnetic field acts like a catalyst to generate mass dynamically .",
    "this is one of the most important effect of ultra - strong magnetic field on the properties of charged elementary particles .",
    "this effect is of course impossible to verify in the terrestrial laboratory .",
    "only the cosmic laboratory offers us the opportunity to test this intrinsic phase transition in the world of elementary particles .",
    "therefore , the presence of strong magnetic field in stellar matter causes a lot of interesting and significant changes in the properties of elementary particles .",
    "also a lot of new phenomena are observed in such cosmic laboratory in presence of ultra - strong magnetic field .",
    "the exotic process of magnetic photon splitting , i.e. , the decay of a photon into two photons ( or combination of two photons into a single one ) in presence of a very strong magnetic field , has recently attracted renewed attention , mainly because of the great importance this process may have in the interpretation of the spectra of cosmic @xmath8-ray burst sources . the basic formulae for magnetic photon splitting had already been derived in the seventies @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "again , since such strong magnetic field can not be generated , even in the pulse form , in the laboratory , it is absolutely impossible to verify this exotic phenomenon of photon splitting .    in this article",
    "we shall develop an exact ( within the limitation of thomas - fermi - dirac model ) formalism of relativistic version of thomas - fermi - dirac model in presence of strong quantizing magnetic field . from this model calculation ,",
    "we shall obtain the equation of state of relatively low density crustal matter of magnetars , which is mainly dense iron crystal .",
    "we shall replace the iron ions / atoms by wigner - seitz cells with non - uniform electron density within each cell .",
    "we have organized the paper in the following manner : in the next section , we shall present the basic formalism of relativistic thomas - fermi - dirac equation in presence of strong quantizing magnetic field . in section 3 , we shall evaluate the equation of state of low density crustal matter of strongly magnetized neutron star .",
    "the kinetic energy part of the electron gas within each cell is obtained in section 4 .",
    "section 5 is dealt with the electron - nucleus interaction energy . in section 6 , we evaluate the electron - electron direct interaction energy part . the exchange interaction part is obtained in section 7 . the possibility of thomas - fermi induced charge within each cell is discussed in section 8 and finally in section 9 , the last section , we shall discuss the results and future prospects of this model .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the formalism we are presenting in this article is also applicable to strongly magnetized white dwarfs . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we have compared the results of the present model , with other possible physical scenarios , e.g. , non - relativistic case with zero and non - zero values of landau quantum number , with the non - relativistic and relativistic field free cases , etc .",
    "finally , we would like to mention , that the properties of low density magnetized crustal matter , mainly the electromagnetic properties , which also includes the transport properties have been studied thoroughly by potekhin and potekhin et .",
    "al . @xcite .",
    "in the past few decades , a lot of work have been done on both thomas - fermi and thomas - fermi - dirac models in absence as well as in presence of strong magnetic fields to obtain the equation of state of low density crustal matter of compact stellar objects .",
    "unfortunately , the calculations are either based on some crude approximation or are incomplete in nature . in those calculations , in presence of strong quantizing magnetic field , the occupancy of only the zeroth landau level by electrons were considered",
    ". however , such approximation is valid if the magnetic fields are extremely strong . in one of the previous calculations we also made a preliminary study of low density crustal matter of neutron stars in presence of strong quantizing magnetic field using the thomas - fermi - dirac approach .",
    "the model was non - relativistic in nature and occupancy of only the zeroth landau level was taken into account @xcite . in some work , more than a decade ago , shivamogi and mulser did some relativistic calculation for atoms in ultra - strong magnetic field @xcite .",
    "again , the calculation is applicable for the system where only the zeroth landau level is occupied .",
    "a similar type of calculation was also done without magnetic field by ruffini @xcite . at this point",
    "we should mention that thomas - fermi model is not an exact method .",
    "it is a semi - classical approach .",
    "it was shown by lieb and simon that this model will be an exact one for atoms , molecules or solid in general , if the atomic number @xmath9 @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite for the very nice review articles ) . the thomas - fermi model in presence of ultra - strong magnetic field ( when only the zeroth landau level is populated ) in the non - relativistic regime",
    "was first used by kadomtsev @xcite .",
    "it was shown that in presence of strong magnetic field , the electrons move in cylindrical shells with the axis directed along the magnetic field .",
    "the atoms thus have elongated cylindrical shapes and much more binding energies . the thomas - fermi model for heavier atoms have also been studied by mueller et .",
    "al . , using a variational approach @xcite .",
    "the relativistic corrections of these calculations was done by hill et .",
    "al . @xcite .",
    "but in each of these studies an extremely strong magnetic field was considered , so that electrons occupy only the zeroth landau level .    to develop an exact formalism for relativistic thomas - fermi - dirac model in presence of strong quantizing magnetic field at zero temperature",
    "( it is assumed that the electron gas within the cell is strongly degenerate ) , we assume that the magnetic field @xmath10 is uniform throughout the star and is along @xmath11-direction , i.e. , our choice of gauge is @xmath12 . now in the relativistic scenario , the landau levels of the electrons will be populated if the magnetic field strength @xmath13 exceeds the quantum critical value @xmath14 g ( throughout this article we assume @xmath15 ) . in the relativistic regime",
    "the quantum critical value is the typical strength of the magnetic field at which the electron cyclotron quantum exceeds the corresponding rest mass energy or equivalently the de broglie wave length for electron exceeds its larmor radius . in presence of such strong quantizing magnetic field along @xmath11-axis the electron momenta in the orthogonal plane",
    "get quantized and are given by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , the well known landau quantum numbers .",
    "the component along @xmath11-axis varies continuously from @xmath18 to @xmath19 , for non - zero temperature , whereas , in the zero temperature case , we have the relation : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the electron fermi momentum .",
    "the phenomenon is known as the landau quantization .",
    "further , the phase space volume integral in the momentum space in this quantized condition is given by @xmath22 the presence of the multiplicative factor @xmath23 is justified by the fact that the zeroth landau level is singly degenerate , whereas all other states are doubly degenerate ( which will only be obvious if one solves dirac equation in presence of strong external magnetic field of strength @xmath24 ) .",
    "the modified form of spinor solutions of dirac equation for electrons in dirac - pauli representation , in presence of strong quantizing magnetic fields are given by @xmath25 where @xmath26^{1/2 } } \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } ( e_\\nu+m)i_{\\nu;p_y}(x)\\\\ 0\\\\ p_zi_{\\nu;p_y}(x)\\\\ -i(2\\nu eb)^{1/2 } i_{\\nu-1;p_y}(x ) \\end{array } \\right ) \\ ] ] and @xmath27^{1/2 } } \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } 0\\\\ ( e_\\nu+m)i_{\\nu-1;p_y}(x)\\\\ i(2\\nu eb)^{1/2 } i_{\\nu;p_y}(x)\\\\ -p_zi_{\\nu-1;p_y}(x ) \\end{array } \\right ) \\ ] ] where the symbols @xmath28 and @xmath29 indicates up and down spin states respectively , @xmath30 h_\\nu \\left [ ( eb)^{1/2}\\left ( x-\\frac{p_y}{eb } \\right ) \\right ] \\ ] ] with @xmath31 is the well known hermite polynomial of order @xmath32 , @xmath33 , the single particle energy eigen value , @xmath34 , @xmath35 are the length scales along @xmath36 and @xmath11 directions respectively , @xmath37 is the magnitude of the charge carried by electrons and @xmath38 is the electron rest mass .",
    "now for @xmath39 , using the inequality @xmath40 , the upper limit of landau quantum number upto which can be occupied at zero temperature is given by @xmath41\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is an integer but less than the actual value of the quantity within the third brackets at the right hand side and @xmath42 is the electron chemical potential . at zero temperature ,",
    "the upper limit of @xmath32-sum will be @xmath43 instead of @xmath19 .",
    "the external magnetic field will therefore behave like a classical entity if the strength is less than the quantum threshold value and in this region one has to take the standard form of plane wave solution of dirac spinors .",
    "whereas , in presence of ultra - strong magnetic field , the maximum value of the landau quantum number as mentioned above becomes zero . which indicates that all the electrons occupy the zeroth landau level have their spins aligned opposite to the direction of magnetic field .",
    "following eqn.(1 ) , it is very easy to show that in presence of strong quantizing magnetic field the number density for electron is given by @xmath44 in the thomas - fermi - dirac model in presence of strong magnetic field in the relativistic region , we replace the atoms / ions by wigner - seitz cells with varying electron density and assume that @xmath45 and @xmath11 are the mass number and atomic number within the cell ( @xmath46 , with @xmath47 , the number of neutrons ) . to make each cell charge neutral , @xmath11 must also be the number of electrons within the cell .",
    "we further assume that instead of a point object , the radius of the nucleus is given by @xmath48 with @xmath49fm .",
    "we will see later that this choice will remove the singularity of thomas - fermi equation at the origin .",
    "the electrostatic potential @xmath50 , felt by electrons satisfy the poisson s equation , given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the proton density within the nucleus , given by @xmath53 the second term on the right hand side of eqn.(8 ) is nuclear contribution . now",
    "the maximum energy of an electron at @xmath54 within the cell is given by @xmath55 in case it is not a constant , the electrons will try to occupy a position within the cell to have minimum energy .",
    "this will develop an instability in the system . from the above equation we have @xmath56^{1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 .",
    "since we are interested to have electron distribution only outside the nucleus , we discard the proton contribution in the poisson s equation .",
    "further , the potential must satisfy the following boundary conditions : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the surface value of @xmath60 ( the geometrical structure of each cell is assumed to be spherical in nature ) .",
    "the poisson s equation is then given by @xmath61^{1/2}\\ ] ] we now substitute @xmath62 then the modified form of the poisson s equation is given by @xmath63 with @xmath64 from ( c ) and ( d ) , it is therefore quite obvious , that the radius of each spherical cell , at the crustal region , decreases with the strength of magnetic field and the change is @xmath65 .",
    "the squeezing of the wigner - seitz cells in presence of strong magnetic field is analogous to the well known magneto striction phenomenon observed in classical magneto - static problem .",
    "further , the right hand side of the final form of the poisson s equation ( eqn.(14 ) ) must be real .",
    "it requires , that the inequality @xmath66 must be satisfied . which after using @xmath67 and @xmath68 , gives @xmath69 \\geq 0\\ ] ] this equation indicates that the upper limit of the landau quantum number of the levels occupied by the wigner - seitz electrons depends on its position within the cells . or in other wards , the value of @xmath43 at some point @xmath70 within the cell also depends on the strength of electrostatic potential at that point ( of course it is assumed that the magnetic field is constant throughout the star ) .",
    "since we have assumed a finite dimension for the nucleus , the problem of singularity at the origin will not appear here ( origin is actually excluded in our numerical calculation , see also @xcite ) .",
    "since the minimum value of @xmath43 is zero for ultra - strong magnetic field case , we have a maximum value of atomic radius , given by @xmath71 , where @xmath72 the value of @xmath73 , obtained from the numerical solution of the poisson s equation , must satisfy this inequality .",
    "further , it is very easy to show from the conditions ( a ) and ( b ) , using ( c ) and ( d ) , that the initial and the surface condition for @xmath50 are given by @xmath74 respectively .",
    "these conditions are identical with the field free case @xcite . while solving the poisson s equation numerically using the two boundary conditions ( a ) and ( b ) ( in the numerical calculation we have followed the standard 4-point runge - kutta technique with shooting method at the surface ) , we found that it is absolutely necessary to incorporate all other extra conditions appearing in this particular case ( eqns.(15 ) and ( 16 ) ) .",
    "the surface condition must also satisfy @xmath75 since the integration range is from @xmath76 to @xmath59 ( origin is avoided ) , the serious problem of singularity associated with thomas - fermi - dirac equation , at the centre of the cell will no longer be there .",
    "therefore , in this particular case , it is also not necessary to follow the numerical methods prescribed by feynman , metropolis and teller @xcite .",
    "the corresponding expression for the poisson s equation for @xmath77 in the non - relativistic regime is given by @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) @xmath78 where @xmath79 with @xmath80 , the bohr radius .",
    "this equation has a singularity at the origin .    to obtain the variation of @xmath81 with @xmath70 within a typical wigner - seitz cell",
    ", we have solved the poisson s equation ( eqn.(14 ) ) numerically considering all the necessary conditions as mentioned above along with the boundary conditions ( a ) and ( b ) . in fig.(1 ) we have plotted @xmath82 as a function of @xmath60 ( in  ) ,   the radius of the cell , for three different initial values for @xmath83 and magnetic field strength @xmath84 g . in fig.(2 ) we have plotted the same quantity but for three different magnetic field strengths .",
    "it is quite obvious from the curves of fig.(2 ) that the surface of the cell is reached later for low magnetic field strength compared to stronger values .",
    "this is consistent with the well known magneto striction phenomenon .",
    "to obtain the equation of state of such low density crustal matter in presence of strong quantizing magnetic field in the relativistic region , we first evaluate the kinetic pressure , given by @xmath85 this momentum integral can very easily be evaluate and is given by @xmath86\\ ] ] where @xmath87 .",
    "the above expression , therefore gives the cell averaged kinetic pressure . to obtain the numerical values , it is necessary to express @xmath88 as a function of @xmath89 using eqn.(21 ) as given below ( either the correct expression , particularly for numerical evaluation or the approximate one for the analytical result ) . for the exact expression , as given in eqn.(19 ) , the functional relation is extremely complicated and has to be obtained numerically . to get a simple mathematical expression for kinetic pressure , we consider the ultra - relativistic case , which gives @xmath90 now to express the fermi momentum as a function of @xmath89 in the ultra - relativistic limit , we consider @xmath56^{1/2 } = \\left [ z^2e^4 \\left ( \\frac{\\phi(x_s)}{\\mu x_s}\\right ) ^2-m_\\nu^2 \\right ] ^{1/2},\\ ] ] which is the correct expression . on putting this correct expression for fermi momentum in eqn.(19 ) , the exact functional dependence of kinetic pressure on @xmath89 can be obtained .",
    "the approximate form may be obtained by neglecting @xmath68 , and we have @xmath91 substituting the conditions ( c ) and ( d ) , we have @xmath92 hence @xmath93 in this approximation , the electron number density is given by @xmath94 whereas , the usual form of mass density or rest energy density of the crustal region of neutron stars , contributed by the massive nuclear part , is given by @xmath95 here , the nuclei are assumed to be static in nature and are not affected by strong magnetic field . whereas , electrons within the cells are considered to be almost free and dominates the kinetic pressure part . on eliminating @xmath96 from eqn.(24 ) and either from eqn.(19 ) or eqn.(22 ) ,",
    "we get the equation of state of low density crustal matter in exact or approximate form respectively .",
    "in this section we shall evaluate the energy contribution from the electron part within the cell .",
    "although it is small enough compared to the rest energy from nuclear part in the non - relativistic region , we have noticed that it has a significant amount of contribution in the relativistic scenario .",
    "the energy contribution from the electronic part consists of four main parts , they are : ( i ) the kinetic energy part , ( ii ) the electron - nucleus interaction part , ( iii ) the electron - electron direct interaction part and ( iv ) the electron - electron exchange interaction part . there can be another important contribution , the correlation part .",
    "now the correlation energy is not a quantity with physical significance .",
    "it actually gives the error incurred in making a fairly crude approximation . in the hartree zeroth order approximation , the @xmath47-electron distribution function factors into a product of @xmath47 one - electron distributions . in the hartree - fock wave function ( slatter determinant form )",
    "correlations are introduced in the first order approximation . in the evaluation of actual correlation term ,",
    "higher order approximations are incorporated and the exchange term is excluded .",
    "since the exchange term is absorbed in the many body correlation terms , in the density functional theory , it is conventionally known as the exchange - correlation term and obtained with some approximation of electron density . in this article , however , we have not taken the correlation part into account . in some future communication",
    "we shall bring this extra term in the energy expression and evaluate numerically the equation of state of low density crustal matter .",
    "now the contribution from electrons to the kinetic energy part is given by @xmath97\\ ] ] evaluating the integral over @xmath98 , the exact expression for kinetic energy is given by @xmath99\\ ] ] where the exact form of @xmath21 is given by @xmath100^{1/2}\\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\left [ \\frac{z^2e^4\\phi(x)^2}{\\mu^2x^2}-m_\\nu^2\\right ] ^{1/2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again this will give an extremely complicated functional dependence on @xmath81 .",
    "in addition , since @xmath101 depends on the radial coordinate , the evaluation of @xmath102 by analytical integration is just impossible .",
    "therefore , numerical technique has to be followed to evaluate the integrals along with the sum over @xmath32 . numerically fitted functional forms for @xmath81 and the corresponding @xmath103 are used to evaluate the kinetic energy numerically . to get a simpler expression , we go to the ultra - relativistic limit , then @xmath104 to obtain an approximate result , we use the relations @xmath105 and @xmath106 then integrating by parts the poisson s equation , considering the surface condition and finally with the trivial relation ( we further assume that @xmath43 is a function of @xmath96 , instead of a function of @xmath70 ) @xmath107 we have @xmath108\\ ] ] for ultra - strong magnetic field , @xmath109 , then we have @xmath110\\ ] ] on the other hand , from eqn.(27 ) if we consider @xmath111 then in the ultra - relativistic approximation we have the same result as shown in eqn.(32 ) .",
    "the cell averaged electron kinetic energy density is then given by @xmath112 the corresponding expression for @xmath77 in the non - relativistic regime is given by @xcite @xmath113\\ ] ]",
    "next we consider the three possible types of interaction term .",
    "let us first consider the electron - nucleus interaction term , given by @xmath114 where the exact expression for electron density @xmath115 is given by eqn.(7 ) and the fermi momentum @xmath116 is given by eqn.(27 ) .",
    "then we have after expressing @xmath116 as a function of @xmath81 @xmath117 this integral can not be evaluated analytically . to obtain the exact values for @xmath118 , as before ,",
    "we need @xmath81 as a function of @xmath70 and @xmath43 as a function of @xmath81 within the integration range . to get a simple form , we consider the ultra - relativistic limit .",
    "then we have @xmath119 using the approximate form of the poisson s equation , given by @xmath120 we have ( again assuming @xmath121 instead of a function of @xmath70 ) @xmath122 we finally have , after integrating by parts and using the surface condition for @xmath81 @xmath123\\ ] ] the sum of electron kinetic energy and the electron - nucleus interaction energy is then given by @xmath124\\ ] ] and the cell averaged electron - nucleus interaction energy density is given by @xmath125 the corresponding zero field value in the non - relativistic regime is given by @xcite @xmath126",
    "next we shall consider the exchange term .",
    "the exchange energy integral corresponding to the @xmath173th .",

    "however , a simple form can be achieved if all the electrons occupy only the zeroth landau level ( i.e. , @xmath109 ) .",
    "this special case have been discussed later in this article . in the numerical evaluation of the above exchange energy integral , we have put @xmath191 , the electron fermi energy and for the sake of convenience we make the following substitution : @xmath192 since @xmath193 , @xmath194 and @xmath195",
    ", the limits of the new variables will also remain same .",

    ", we must mention that in a very recent work , shabad and usov have investigated the effect of strong magnetic field on coulomb potential @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the coulomb potential gets modified significantly in presence of strong quantizing magnetic field .",
    "this is , unlike the thomas - fermi model , is an exact field theoretic approach . in this work the modified form of vacuum polarization ( grossly speaking",

    "it has also been noticed that unlike other scenario , one extra condition appears in the non - relativistic regime with @xmath228 and @xmath221 .      in our model ,",

    "the formalism is of course not applicable to the inner crust region , where the matter density is close to the neutron drip point , some of the neutrons may come out from the cells . in some future communication we shall present a modified version of this formalism appropriate for the inner crust region .",
    "we have assumed that all the electrons within the cells are moving freely , i.e. , they are not bound in any one of the atomic orbitals . in reality",
    ", it may happen that the electrons at the vicinity of the nucleus in a cell have negative energy .",
    "these electrons , therefore can not be treated as free .",
    "it is therefore absolutely necessary to get the total energy of an electron as a function of its position ( @xmath60 or @xmath70 ) within the cell from the numerical solution of the poisson s equation and the expressions for kinetic and various form of interaction energies .",
    "we expect that very close to the nucleus , the electron energy will be negative and for a particular value of @xmath70 ( @xmath352 ) ( which may be a function of @xmath13 ) it will become zero ( quasi - free electrons ) and then becomes positive .",
    "if it is found so , then we can not assume that all the @xmath11-electrons in the cell are participating in statistical processes .",
    "on the other hand , if we consider the expression for electron energy as given in eqn.(86 ) , then from the physics point of view all the electrons will become free ( energy is always positive ) .",
    "whereas , if we consider @xmath353 then we may have bound , quasi - free and free electrons within the cells .",
    "the presence of free electrons in the compressed cells in a dense medium is popularly known as _ statistical ionization _ ( see reference @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .    to conclude our results , in the following we have given in tabular form the variation of fermi momentum , pressure , and various kinds of energy ( except the exchange energy part ) for electron gas within a typical wigner - seitz cell , with the strength of magnetic field .",
