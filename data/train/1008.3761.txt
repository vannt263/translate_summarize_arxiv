    "in recent years there has been a growing interest in metric graphs as the underlying structure for models in many branches of science , for example in physics , biology , chemistry , engineering and computer science , to name just a few .",
    "the interested reader is referred to the review  @xcite and to the articles in the volume  @xcite .",
    "metric graphs are piecewise linear varieties with singularities at a finite number of points , namely at the vertices , and they can be thought of as a finite collection of finite intervals or half lines , which are glued together at some of their endpoints .",
    "there exists an extensive amount of literature on laplace operators and their semigroups on metric graphs , see e.g. , @xcite and the literature quoted there . in view of this , it is natural to investigate brownian motions on metric graphs , and in this context we also want to mention the articles  @xcite which deal with various aspects of stochastic processes on ( metric ) graphs .",
    "the present article is one of four articles ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) of the authors in which we address the problem of the characterization of all brownian motions ( the precise definition of this class of stochastic processes is given in  @xcite ) , and their pathwise construction on a given metric graph .",
    "thus , for metric graphs we consider  with certain restrictions ( see  @xcite and below )  the analogue of the problem raised by feller in his pioneering articles  @xcite , which have to be considered together with the work of it and mckean  @xcite , and the article  @xcite of wentzell . for later accounts of this subject",
    "we also refer to  @xcite and  @xcite .    of course , according to our above description , the simplest metric graphs are given by a half line as @xmath0 or a compact interval , say , @xmath1 $ ] , that is , the cases considered in the aforementioned classical literature . one of the intentions of the present article is to bring the material presented there into a form which is suitable for a generalization to metric graphs .",
    "the other intention is to give a pedagogical ( and rather detailed ) account of the construction of feller brownian motions on intervals .",
    "a very readable treatment can be found in the book  @xcite by knight .",
    "however , there some arguments are only hinted at , others are not so easy to follow ( at least for the present authors ) .",
    "we have tried to make the article self - contained , which means that several of our arguments are rather well - known .",
    "on the other hand , we shall give a number of arguments and computations which to the best of our knowledge are new .",
    "for example , we shall compute all transition and resolvent kernels explicitly , and in two cases we provide rather simple calculations of the generators based on dynkin s formula  @xcite .",
    "these calculations carry through to the case of metric graphs , and this will make it possible to compare the resolvents obtained with those found in  @xcite .",
    "this in turn allows  at least in certain cases  to rediscover from a stochastic point of view a central entity of quantum theory , namely the _ scattering matrix_.    for the definition of a brownian motion on an interval we shall follow knight  @xcite ( in  @xcite this definition is extended to metric graphs ) .",
    "let @xmath2 be a finite or semi - finite interval , and let @xmath3 denote a stochastic process with values in @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a cemetery point .",
    "moreover , let @xmath6 be a standard one dimensional brownian motion .",
    "we denote by @xmath7 , @xmath8 , the processes @xmath3 , @xmath6 respectively , with absorption ( i.e. , stopping ) at the endpoint(s ) of @xmath2 .",
    "[ def_bm ] a brownian motion @xmath3 on a finite or semi - infinite interval is a normal strong markov process on @xmath4 , a.s .  with right continuous paths , continuous paths up to its lifetime , and such that the stochastic process  @xmath9 is equivalent to  @xmath8 .",
    "we remark that this definition implies that we consider a considerably smaller class of stochastic processes than has been treated in the quoted work by feller and it ",
    "mckean , in that there the paths are not required to be continuous up to the lifetime . in particular , there jumps from an endpoint back into the interval are allowed . on the other hand",
    ", this restriction will allow us in the present series of articles to work within the class of feller processes , which has advantages concerning the control of the strong markov property .",
    "some of the consequences the restriction we impose will also be discussed below . within the more general framework of metric graphs the assumption that the paths are continuous up to their lifetime will be removed in a forthcoming work .    for the sake of definiteness , from now on we shall only consider intervals @xmath2 of the form @xmath10 or @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "@xmath11 denotes the space of real valued continuous functions on @xmath10 vanishing at infinity , while @xmath12)$ ] is the space of real valued continuous functions on @xmath1 $ ] . by @xmath13 we mean either of the two spaces , and we make the convention that every @xmath14 is extended to @xmath4 by setting @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 denotes the subspace of @xmath13 consisting of those functions @xmath17 in @xmath13 which are twice continuously differentiable in the interior of @xmath2 , and are such that the second derivative @xmath18 extends to a continuous function on @xmath2 .",
    "it is not difficult to check that for @xmath19 the derivative @xmath20 has a ( finite ) limit @xmath21 from the right at @xmath22 , and  if @xmath23 $ ]  also a ( finite ) limit @xmath24 from the left at @xmath25 .",
    "then for brownian motions on @xmath2 as in definition  [ def_bm ] feller s theorem is the following statement .",
    "[ feller - bc ] assume that @xmath3 is a brownian motion on @xmath2 .",
    "then the generator @xmath26 of its semigroup on @xmath13 is given by @xmath27 with a domain @xmath28 being a subset of @xmath16 .",
    "moreover the following holds true :    suppose that @xmath29 .",
    "then there exist @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 $ ] with @xmath33 , @xmath34 , such that every @xmath35 satisfies the wentzell boundary condition at the origin @xmath36 and the domain @xmath37 is uniquely determined by this boundary condition .",
    "suppose that @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "then there exist @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 $ ] , @xmath41 , @xmath25 , with @xmath42 , @xmath43 , such that every @xmath35 satisfies the boundary condition  , supplemented by the boundary condition @xmath44 the domain @xmath45)$ ] is uniquely determined by the boundary conditions  , .",
    "furthermore the following statement holds true :    [ feller_prop ] every browian motion on @xmath2 in the sense of definition  [ def_bm ] is a feller process .",
    "proofs of these theorems can be found in  @xcite .",
    "for the case of metric graphs proofs of similar statements are provided in  @xcite .",
    "we remark that the boundary conditions determined by a brownian motion in the sense of definition  [ def_bm ] are _ local _ , because each of the conditions  , only involves the values of the function @xmath17 and its derivatives at one or the other endpoints of the interval .",
    "in fact , this is a consequence of our requirement that the paths of the brownian motion be continuous up to their lifetime .",
    "more general boundary conditions arise if one allows for jumps from the endpoints back into the interval .",
    "they have been discussed in the above quoted work by feller and by it ",
    "mckean , see also @xcite .    in order to explain the ideas of how to construct such brownian motions pathwise from a standard brownian motion @xmath6 , for the choice @xmath46 let us first discuss the `` pure '' cases , where only one of the terms in equation   is present .",
    "first consider the choice @xmath47 , @xmath48 , i.e. , the dirichlet boundary condition @xmath49 .",
    "( this condition is actually not permitted according to the statement of the theorem , but temporarily we shall consider it nevertheless , see also below . ) then this boundary condition can be implemented by killing the standard brownian motion when it reaches the origin , since by our convention @xmath15 .",
    "the reason that this case has to be excluded in theorem  [ feller - bc ] is that due our definition , a brownian motion @xmath3 on @xmath0 is such that @xmath9 is equivalent to @xmath8 , and therefore has to be able to reach @xmath22 , which is not possible for a right continuous process which is killed upon reaching @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , a process which is killed upon reaching @xmath22 , obviously can not be a feller process .",
    "the choice @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the neumann boundary condition @xmath53 , and it is well - known ( e.g. , @xcite , cf .",
    "also section  [ sect_el ] ) that this can be obtained from a brownian motion with reflection at @xmath22 .",
    "finally , it we choose @xmath54 , @xmath55 , then we find the wentzell boundary condition @xmath56 .",
    "obviously , this means that the generator annihilates the function at @xmath22 , i.e. , the semigroup acts trivially there . in terms of the underlying stochastic process",
    "this means that it stops to move there , and so one can implement this boundary condition with the brownian motion @xmath8 with absorption in @xmath22 .",
    "for the general case   one has to construct a stochastic process which combines all these effects . according to  ( * ? ? ? * section  2 ) , it was feller who suggested how to do this ( at least for the _ elastic case _",
    "@xmath34 , @xmath57 , @xmath52 ) : for a reflecting brownian motion one builds in the effects of killing and absorption _ on the scale of the local time at @xmath22_. more precisely , for the brownian motion on @xmath0 with all three coefficients in   non - zero , one uses the local time of the reflecting brownian motion to define a new stochastic time scale which slows down the process when it is at the origin .",
    "this makes the origin `` sticky '' for the process , and replaces the full absorption in the `` pure '' case @xmath55 .",
    "then , on this new stochastic time scale the process is killed exponentially to produce a term involving @xmath58 like in the `` pure '' dirichlet case .",
    "these ideas have been carried out in  @xcite , cf.also  @xcite .",
    "the case of an elastic brownian motion has also been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "before we end this introduction with an overview of the organization of this article let us quickly settle one trivial case of a brownian motion on @xmath0 , namely when @xmath59 .",
    "the subcase @xmath50 has already been treated above : the brownian motion @xmath8 with absorption realizes this boundary condition .",
    "so consider @xmath34 , @xmath60 , and set @xmath61 .",
    "define a stochastic process @xmath3 as follows : start with a brownian motion at @xmath62 , and when hitting the origin keep the process there for an independent exponential holding time of rate @xmath63 .",
    "after expiration of this holding time let the process jump to the cemetery point @xmath5 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that this process is a brownian motion on @xmath0 in the sense of definition  [ def_bm ] , that it has @xmath64 times the laplacean as the generator , and that its semigroup @xmath65 acts at the origin as @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "thus this process implements the desired boundary condition @xmath68 .",
    "the organization of the article is as follows . in sections  [ sect_el ]  [ sect_gen ] we consider the interval @xmath46 . _",
    "elastic brownian motion _",

    "following an idea of knight  @xcite , we use the stochastic processes constructed before on the intervals @xmath70 $ ] and @xmath10 to piece together a stochastic process on @xmath1 $ ] , which generates the boundary conditions  , .",
    "the most difficult point is the verification of the ( simple ) markov property of this process , and some parts of the rather lengthy and technical proof are deferred to an appendix .",
    "there are also appendices about killing a process with a perfect homogeneous functional ( included here , because we use the same method of killing as in  @xcite , for which we need some results which are not easily available in the standard literature ) , about some results related to the brownian local time , and about general heat kernels and their laplace transforms .",
