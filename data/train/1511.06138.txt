    "we would like to implement a two - dimensional ( 2d ) grid of qubits , where single - qubit gates and two - qubit gates between nearest - neighbor qubits can be done _ locally _ , that is , without affecting the other qubits in the grid .",

    "let us first consider a system where a qubit is coupled to a resonator via its @xmath2-degree of freedom .",

    "note that while the treatment in the transverse case ( eq . [ eq : sw ] ) is only perturbative , the lang - firsov transformation is _ exact _ , with no restrictions on the coupling strength or detuning of the system .",
