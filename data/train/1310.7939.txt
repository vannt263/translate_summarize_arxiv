    "waves and oscillations manifesting in the immediate vicinity of sunspots have been known for over @xmath0  years @xcite",
    ". early work on oscillatory phenomena in sunspot structures helped validate the detection of long - period oscillations , which are generated by the response of the umbral photosphere to the 5-minute @xmath1-mode global oscillations @xcite .",
    "while oscillations in solar active regions are dominated by periodicities intrinsically linked to the global @xmath1-mode spectrum , a wealth of alternative wave periods can also be identified in the sunspot locality , spanning three orders - of - magnitude from several seconds @xcite , through to in - excess of one hour @xcite .",
    "the first observational evidence of running penumbral waves ( rpws ) came from @xcite and @xcite , who detected concentric intensity waves propagating outwards through the penumbra of a sunspot .",
    "these waves , deemed as acoustic modes , were observed to propagate with a phase velocity of @xmath2  kms@xmath3 and intensity fluctuations in the range @xmath2% .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have since revealed how the frequencies and phase speeds of rpws are largest ( 3  mhz , 40  kms@xmath3 ) at the inner penumbral boundary , decreasing to their lowest values ( 1  mhz , 10  kms@xmath3 ) at the outer penumbral edge . additionally , @xcite has shown that the propagation of rpws can be observed in the chromosphere up to @xmath4@xmath5 ( @xmath4@xmath6  km ) from the outer edge of the penumbral boundary , suggesting the quiet - sun @xmath1-mode oscillations dominate at greater distances , hence over - powering the signatures of any remaining rpws .",
    "the origin of rpws has been under intense debate ever since their discovery , with current research attempting to address whether they are trans - sunspot waves of purely chromospheric origin ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and the references therein ) , or the chromospheric signature of upwardly - propagating @xmath1-mode waves @xcite .",
    "the sequence of studies by @xcite and @xcite employed multi - height imaging and doppler velocity measurements to examine the phase lag between sunspot oscillations at different layers of the lower solar atmosphere . through examination of two - dimensional power maps and their resulting spatial coherence , the authors interpreted the correlation between umbral oscillations at various atmospheric heights and simultaneous rpws as a strong indication that rpws are excited by upwardly - propagating photospheric umbral oscillations .",
    "more recently , @xcite employed similar multi - height imaging and spectroscopy to investigate the coupling between umbral and penumbral oscillations using spectral , phase - difference , and coherence analysis techniques .",
    "however , the authors detected large jumps in the oscillation period and the intensity - velocity phase difference at the umbra - penumbra boundary , and as a result , were unable to convincingly support the upwardly - propagating @xmath1-mode wave scenario .",
    "conversely , @xcite examined chromospheric velocity oscillations in sunspot penumbrae , and concluded that rpws are the observational signature of slow - mode waves propagating along expanding magnetic field lines .",
    "employing two - dimensional mapping of power and oscillatory period , @xcite were also able to suggest that rpw phenomena could be attributed to near - acoustic field - aligned upwardly - propagating waves .",
    "@xcite also provided momentum to the interpretation that rpws are simply a chromospheric signature of upwardly - propagating acoustic waves by combining high - resolution spectra with fourier phase - difference analysis to reveal how they readily propagate along magnetic fields in a low @xmath7 ( i.e. dominated by magnetic pressure ) environment . in the solar photosphere , the strong magnetic field strengths associated with sunspot umbrae result in a large magnetic pressure ( i.e. @xmath8 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this regime , the magnetic field",
    "is not influenced by the motion of the plasma , and as a result tends to a potential configuration of minimal energy @xcite .",
    "however , the magnetic field strength decreases radially away from the sunspot umbra , rapidly causing the gas pressure to dominate towards the edge of the penumbra ( i.e. @xmath9 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the field of magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) seismology has rapidly risen to the forefront of solar physics research in recent years .",
    "such techniques allow the physical quantities and structures of sub - resolution solar features to be derived directly from the analysis of waveforms propagating through the local plasma ( * ? ? ?",

    "the advent of modern , high - resolution ground- and space - based instrumentation has allowed mhd seismology to uncover a wide range of new solar phenomena in the lower solar atmosphere , including torsional alfvn waves @xcite , sausage waves @xcite , oscillations in the magnetic field @xcite , the presence of dual oscillating modes @xcite , and aspects of mode conversion @xcite . by studying the fundamental parameters of ubiquitous mhd wave motion in the lower solar atmosphere , we are provided with a key opportunity to probe the constituent mechanisms behind some of the most dramatic and widespread solar phenomena .    in this paper",
    ", we utilise high spatial and temporal resolution observations to investigate the propagation characteristics of rpws in the lower solar atmosphere .",
    "we employ fourier analysis and potential magnetic field extrapolations , in a previously unexplored way , to study the variation of rpws in the vicinity of a near - circular sunspot , and relate the derived characteristics to the spatially dependent magnetic field inclination angles of the underlying sunspot .",
    "the observational data presented here are part of a sequence obtained during @xmath10:@xmath11  @xmath12:@xmath13  ut on 2011 december 10 , with the dunn solar telescope ( dst ) at sacramento peak , new mexico .",

    "rosa continuum observations were acquired through a 52 bandpass filter centered at 4170 , and employed a common plate scale of @xmath19 per pixel , providing a diffraction - limited field - of - view size of @xmath20 .",
    "hardcam observations employed a @xmath21 filter centered on the h@xmath22 line core ( 6562.8 ) , and utilised a spatial sampling of @xmath23 per pixel , providing a field - of - view size ( @xmath24 ) comparable to the rosa continuum image sequence . during the observations , high - order adaptive optics @xcite were used to correct wavefront deformations in real - time .",
    "the acquired images were further improved through speckle reconstruction algorithms @xcite , utilizing @xmath25 and @xmath26 restorations for the continuum and h@xmath22 images , resulting in reconstructed cadences of @xmath27  s and @xmath28  s , respectively .",
    "atmospheric seeing conditions remained excellent throughout the time series .",
    "however , to insure accurate co - alignment between the bandpasses , broadband time series were fourier co - registered and de - stretched using a @xmath29 grid , equating to a @xmath30@xmath31 separation between spatial samples @xcite .",
    "narrowband images , including those from hardcam , were corrected by applying destretching vectors established from simultaneous broadband reference images @xcite .",
    "sample images , incorporating all image processing steps , can be viewed in figure  [ images ] .",
    "the helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) onboard the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was utilised to provide simultaneous vector magnetograms of active region noaa  @xmath14 .",

    "in addition , one contextual hmi continuum ( @xmath34 ) image , acquired at @xmath10:@xmath11  ut , was obtained for the purposes of co - aligning the hmi data with images of the lower solar atmosphere .",
    "the hmi data were processed using the standard routine , which includes the removal of energetic particle hits .",
    "subsequently , @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath35 sub - fields were extracted from the processed data , with a central pointing close to that of the ground - based image sequences . using the hmi continuum context image to define absolute solar co - ordinates , our ground - based observations were subjected to cross - correlation techniques to provide sub - pixel co - alignment accuracy between the imaging sequences .",
    "to do this , the plate scales of our ground - based observations were first degraded to match that of the hmi continuum image .",
    "next , squared mean absolute deviations were calculated between the datasets , with the ground - based images subsequently shifted to best align with the hmi reference image .",
    "following co - alignment , the maximum x- and y - displacements are both less than one tenth of an hmi pixel , or @xmath37 ( @xmath30@xmath38  km ) .",
    "during the two hour duration of the observing sequence , no large scale eruptive phenomena ( goes a - class or above ) were observed from the active region under investigation .",
    "examination of a time - lapse movie of hardcam h@xmath22 images revealed clear and distinctly periodic outflows along the chromospheric canopy in a direction away from the sunspot , consistent with rpw phenomena @xcite .",
    "the irregular shapes of typical sunspot structures , often coupled with a non - continuous penumbral structure , result in convoluted wave patterns at increasing distances from the umbral edge @xcite . however , the nearly circularly symmetric nature of our observed sunspot revealed a wealth of propagating wave fronts at distances far exceeding the outer penumbral edge .    to verify the presence of wave phenomena in our h@xmath22 field - of - view , we employed a fourier - based filtering algorithm to isolate and re - generate new time series which had been decomposed into frequency bins , each seperated by @xmath39  s , and corresponding to periodicities of @xmath40@xmath41  minutes .",
    "each fourier filter bin was peaked at @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , ",
    ", @xmath45  s , and incorporated a gaussian - profiled window spanning a half - width half - maximum of @xmath46@xmath5  s. we must stress that our fourier filtering algorithm acts only as a frequency ( @xmath47 ) filter .",
    "our algorithm does not make any assumptions regarding the spatial scales associated with a particular frequency , and as a result performs no filtering on the spatial wavenumber ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "examination of the filtered time series clearly revealed that oscillatory signatures with longer periodicities occurred at increasing distances from the sunspot umbra , and propagated with diminishing phase speeds . to quantify these characteristics , time ",
    "distance analysis was employed ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a sample slice position is displayed as a solid white line extending in the north - east direction of the h@xmath22 sunspot depicted in figure  [ images ] . the resulting time ",
    "distance diagrams , for the filtered time series corresponding to the @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52  minute fourier windows , are displayed in the upper and middle panels of figure  [ time_distance ] .",
    "the propagating oscillatory signatures , visible as recurring white and black diagonal bands , clearly show how longer - period oscillations occur more dominantly at further distances from the sunspot umbra ( marked as @xmath53  mm on the y - axis ) .",
    "importantly , these propagating waves appear to be continuous in time , indicating they are driven from a regular and powerful source .",
    "furthermore , the gradient of the diagonal bands provides an indication of the horizontal ( i.e. parallel to the solar surface ) phase speed of the propagating waves . a line - of - best - fit reveals phase speeds of @xmath30@xmath54 , @xmath30@xmath55 , @xmath30@xmath56 , and @xmath30@xmath57  kms@xmath3 for the @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52  minute fourier windows , respectively . employing the line - of - best - fit technique to each of the other fourier - filtered time series reveals phase speeds spanning @xmath30@xmath58  kms@xmath3 ( @xmath42  s periodicity ) to @xmath30@xmath59  kms@xmath3 ( @xmath45  s periodicity ) .",
    "interestingly , the range of measured phase velocities was independent of the orientation of the time  distance slice .",
    "regardless of the azimuthal direction in which the one - dimensional slice was placed , the observed wave periods propagated with the same phase velocities .",
    "all of the measured phase velocities are plotted as a function of oscillatory period in the lower panel of figure  [ time_distance ] . while the characteristics and trends displayed by the rpws studied here are consistent with those measured in previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the implementation of fourier filtering algorithms significantly improves the accuracy of the phase velocity measurements .",
    "each pixel in the unfiltered time series consists of the superposition of a large number of independent wave forms , each with different periodicities and phase speeds .",
    "the filtered time series removes this ambiguity , and allows the exact phase velocity to be reliably extracted as a function of period and distance from the sunspot umbra .",
    "to more closely quantify the characteristics associated with the propagating waves , fourier - based analysis techniques were implemented on the unfiltered data . due to the continual nature of the rpws over the duration of our @xmath60  minute time series , we employed the methodology of @xcite to apply strict fourier analysis to the entire h@xmath22 time series , allowing the signatures of wave phenomena to be easily extracted as a function of period .",
    "the upper - right and lower panels of figure  [ images ] display two - dimensional power maps for periodicities equal to @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64  s. as from the time ",
    "distance analysis shown in figure  [ time_distance ] , it is clear that maximum fourier power ( displayed as bright white ) for longer periodicities occurs at further radial distances from the sunspot umbra . due to the nearly circularly symmetric nature of the sunspot under investigation , the best approach to study oscillatory behaviour as a function of radial distance is to examine the fourier power over a series of expanding annuli .",
    "however , a location to use as the center of the expanding series of annuli must first be specified . to do this , continuum images of the sunspot umbra",
    "were isolated from the surrounding plasma .",
    "a time - averaged continuum image was created by averaging all 4170 blue continuum images over the entire 75  minute duration of the dataset .",
    "next , the umbral pixels were defined as those with an intensity below @xmath65% of the median granulation intensity . features brighter than this were discarded , producing an accurately defined umbral perimeter , containing @xmath4@xmath66 umbral pixels , or an area of @xmath67  km@xmath68 . from this point , the umbral center - of - gravity , or ` barycenter ' , was established , which formed the central co - ordinates of the annuli used in subsequent analysis . here",
    ", a width of 5  pixels for each annulus was chosen , and subsequent annuli were spaced by 2  pixels from the preceding annulus . some overlap between adjacent annuli",
    "was chosen to provide continuous radial coverage of the measured parameters , while still maintaining high pixel numbers to improve statistics .",
    "this was deemed essential , since at smaller radii from the umbral barycenter the number of pixels enclosed within a particular annulus is greatly reduced . therefore , either a thicker annulus could be used , or more overlap could be provided between adjacent annuli .",
    "a thicker annulus was not desirable as this may artifically mask any changes in wave behaviour with distance .",
    "as a result , we chose to use an overlap between adjacent annuli , which greatly assists with measurements at small distances from the umbral barycenter .",
    "this overlap was kept constant for all annuli , regardless of the distance from the umbral barycenter .",
    "a sample annulus , which is 100  pixels ( @xmath4@xmath11  mm ) from the umbral barycenter , is displayed in the upper - middle panel of figure  [ images ] .",
    "examination of the power contained within the annuli reiterated that higher - frequency intensity oscillations were confined to the inner penumbral edge , while lower - frequency perturbations were dominant at further increasing distances from the umbral barycenter ( figure  [ power_plots ] ) .",
    "the highest - frequency intensity oscillations detected had a period @xmath30@xmath65  s , as defined by a @xmath69% confidence level , calculated by multiplying the power in the background spectrum by the values of @xmath70 corresponding to the 95@xmath71 percentile of the distribution @xcite . in this case",
    ", the background spectrum is assumed to be consistent with pure photon noise ( i.e. normally distributed in the limit of large number statistics ) , and following a @xmath70 distribution with two degrees of freedom .",
    "the longest - period intensity oscillations found , which superseded the @xmath69% confidence criteria , were @xmath30@xmath72  s , significantly under the nyquist period of @xmath73  s. the upper - panel of figure  [ power_plots ] reveals the absolute fourier power , which has been spatially and temporarily averaged over each individual annulus , as a function of period and distance from the umbral barycenter . here",
    ", long - period oscillations ( displayed as darker colored lines ) appear to display higher oscillatory power ; a direct result of larger amplitudes accompanying the longer - period waves @xcite .",
    "normalisation of the power spectra , by the average power contained within the entire field - of - view for each corresponding periodicity , reveals more meaningful structural information ( middle panel of figure  [ power_plots ] ) . in this plot",
    ", the vertical axis gives a direct representation of how much each periodicity displays power above its spatially- and temporally - averaged background .",
    "here , the shorter - period waves ( @xmath74  s ) display their peak power at the umbral / penumbral edge , with their relative power approximately three orders - of - magnitude higher than the background .",
    "as distance from the umbral barycenter is increased , the peak power is dominated by further increasing periodicities , with a dominant period @xmath30@xmath75  s at the outer penumbral edge .",
    "it is visually clear in figure  [ power_plots ] that the dominant periodicity increases significantly between the inner and outer penumbral edges .",
    "this effect has been attributed to the inclination angles of the magnetic field lines increasing as a function of distance from the sunspot umbra @xcite . as a result , the acoustic cut - off becomes heavily modified , thus allowing the free propagation of longer - period waves at increasing distances from the sunspot umbra .",
    "@xcite displayed clear evidence of this phenomena by comparing the wave power spectra with the dispersion relations presented by @xcite .",
    "however , the authors employed single - slit spectroscopic measurements with a spatial resolution @xmath76 , and were therefore unable to examine all locations within the sunspot umbra to a high degree of precision . to exploit our high spatial resolution observations , and to quantify the change in period at increasing distances from the sunspot umbra , we calculated the dominant periodicity as a function of distance from the umbral barycenter for 4 distinct regions of the sunspot , consisting of the north ( n ) , west ( w ) , south ( s ) , and east ( e ) quadrants ( see upper - middle panel of figure  [ images ] ) . for each quadrant",
    ", the dominant periodicity was defined as the periodicity which had the most relative power within each annulus segment .",
    "it was found that the w , s , and e quadrants displayed a gradual change in the dominant period as a function of distance from the umbral barycenter ( black line in the lower panel of figure  [ dominant_period ] ) .",
    "however , the n quadrant displayed two distinct gradients between the inner and outer penumbral edges when displayed on a log  log scale .",
    "from the inner penumbral edge ( @xmath30@xmath77  mm from the umbral barycenter ) , to @xmath30@xmath78  mm from the umbral barycenter , a line - of - best - fit reveals a periodicity , @xmath79 , equal to , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the gradient of the line - of - best - fit , @xmath82 is the periodicity when the distance from the umbral barycenter , @xmath83 , equals unity , and the errors listed are the @xmath40@xmath84 uncertainty estimates provided by the fitting function .",
    "the second distinct gradient manifests between @xmath30@xmath78  mm and the outer penumbral edge @xmath30@xmath85  mm from the umbral barycenter . here",
    ", a line - of - best - fit allows the periodicity to be expressed as , @xmath86    while the general increase in period as a function of distance from the sunspot umbra has been well documented in previous studies , this is the first observational evidence of two distinct gradients present in a resulting period  distance plot ( middle panel of figure  [ dominant_period ] ) .",
    "thus , two important questions are why is the n quadrant of the sunspot different from the others ? and what physical mechanisms are responsible for this pronounced effect ?",
    "to investigate , we examined the vector magnetic field information collected by the hmi instrument .",
    "the very fast inversion of the stokes vector ( vfisv ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) algorithm was utilised to decompose the magnetograms into components parallel ( @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath89 ) to the solar surface . specifically , the initial vector field components ( filename ` hmi.me_720s_fd10 ' on the joint science operations center , or jsoc , catalog ) provide three values for each pixel related to the field strength , inclination angle , and non - disambiguated azimuthal angle .",
    "azimuthal disambiguation of the transverse magnetic field vectors was undertaken using the algorithms of @xcite .",
    "the disambiguated vector magnetograms were subsequently transformed into line - of - sight , east - west , and north - south components ( the so - called `` basic '' transformation ) following the procedures outlined in the hmi users guide .",
    "finally , the transformation from the line - of - sight co - ordinate system into the correct heliographic projection ( called either the `` advanced '' or `` vertical / horizontal '' decomposition ) was performed in accordance with @xcite .",
    "while the vfisv milne - eddington inversion algorithm returns a single magnetic field component , there is no doubt that the true magnetic configuration will be more complicated than that portrayed by even the relatively high resolution hmi observations .",
    "particularly , in sunspot penumbrae , individual flux tubes have been found to show an interlocking - comb configuration @xcite , whereby weaker and stronger field components have different inclination angles over very short distances .",
    "in addition , the magnetic structure can not be entirely current - free , and is therefore also highly dynamic and constantly evolving @xcite .",
    "however , for now we use the single field component provided by hmi as a first approximation of the dominant spatially resolved magnetic field vectors present in our observations .",
    "the derived values allowed the absolute magnetic field strength , @xmath90 , to be computed for each pixel within our field - of - view .",
    "importantly , the absolute magnetic field strength provided us with the ability to estimate the location of the @xmath91 layer in the solar photosphere .",
    "the plasma @xmath7 is traditionally defined as the ratio between the gas pressure ( @xmath92 ) and the magnetic pressure ( @xmath93 ) , where @xmath90 is the absolute magnitude of the magnetic field strength .",
    "the plasma gas pressure , @xmath92 , was estimated using the @xcite average sunspot model ` m ' , with parameters used which corresponded to the hmi magnetogram formation height of @xmath4@xmath62 km @xcite . a temperature , @xmath94k , and hydrogen number density , @xmath95@xmath96 , obtained for an atmospheric height @xmath4@xmath62 km from @xcite ,",

    "particularly , there is likely to be small chromospheric opacity in our observations of the umbral core , implying we are seeing further down into the photospheric layer @xcite . from the h@xmath22 image displayed in figure  [ images ] , it is clear that the sunspot umbra is dark and well defined , suggesting that the opacity is greatly reduced and that the formation height may be as low as @xmath106  km .",
    "however , in the penumbra and chromospheric canopy regions , where we actually report on the characteristics of the rpws , the opacity will be much higher in addition to the plasma @xmath7 being considerably larger .",

    "this link between vertical magnetic fields and bright penumbral filaments is in direct agreement with the work of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , in the n quadrant these spines appear to be less pronounced and more curved , resulting in a more rapid , localised change in the magnetic field inclination angle as a function of distance from the umbral barycenter . when this inclination - angle kink is transferred to a chromospheric distance scale",
    ", it occurs at a distance of @xmath30@xmath78 mm ( dashed black line in the upper panel of figure  [ dominant_period ] ) ; exactly the point where we observe a kink in the period  distance diagram for the rpws .",
    "this technique allows us to directly compare the observed chromospheric wave phenomena with photospheric magnetic field inclination angles derived from hmi vector magnetograms .",
    "the output of the magnetic field extrapolations can be viewed in the lower panel of figure  [ magnetogram ] .",
    "the near - potential configuration of the sunspot , in addition to its nearly circularly symmetric composition , results in magnetic field lines expanding outwards in all directions from the underlying umbra .",
    "magnetic field inclination angles play an important role in the propagation of magneto - acoustic wave modes , since in the presence of gravitational fields they can only propagate upwards at frequencies above the acoustic cut - off , @xmath108 , defined as , @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the local sound speed , @xmath111 is the temperature , @xmath112 is the ratio of specific heats , @xmath113 is the mean molecular weight , and @xmath114 is the gas constant .",
    "it was predicted by @xcite , that in regions of low-@xmath7 plasma an effective gravity , @xmath115 , on a particular magnetic field line can be expressed as , @xmath116 where the gravitational acceleration , @xmath117 , is decreased by the cosine of the inclination angle , @xmath102 , with respect to the solar normal . from equation  [ cut_off_freq ] ,",
    "it is clear that the maximum cut - off frequency is determined by the minimum values of @xmath102 ( to maximise the numerator ) and @xmath111 ( to minimise the denominator ) along the path of wave propagation . as a result",
    ", both parameters ( @xmath102 and @xmath111 ) should be taken at the level which corresponds to the minimum temperature along a particular field line ; the `` cut - off height '' .",
    "we assume that both the inclination angle and the temperature will increase beyond the cut - off height , and as a result , the cut - off height will define the frequency spectrum of waves that can propagate beyond the temperature - minimum level .",
    "according to the atmospheric sunspot models of @xcite , the temperature - minimum region is located @xmath118  km above the continuum optical depth @xmath119 . here , we adopt the cut - off height as that corresponding to the formation height of the hmi magnetograms ( @xmath4@xmath62  km ) .",
    "the spatially - dependent cut - off frequencies were calculated using a minimum temperature , @xmath120  k , @xmath121  gmol@xmath3 , @xmath122  ms@xmath123 ( and then combined with the extrapolated @xmath124 terms to find the spatially - dependent effective gravity ) , @xmath125  jmol@xmath3k@xmath3 , and @xmath126 for an ideal monoatomic gas .",
    "the azimuthally averaged cut - off periods for the n and w+s+e sunspot quadrants are displayed as a function of chromospheric distance from the umbral barycenter using grey lines in the middle and lower panels of figure  [ dominant_period ] , respectively .",
    "the kink present in the inclination angle ( n quadrant ; @xmath30@xmath107 mm photospheric distance or @xmath30@xmath78 mm chromospheric distance ) diagram in the upper panel of figure  [ dominant_period ] results in a similar kink in the corresponding cut - off period ( grey line in the middle panel of figure  [ dominant_period ] ) .",
    "contrarily , the more smoothly varying inclination angles present in the w+s+e quadrants results in an equally smooth variation in the resulting cut - off period ( grey line in the lower panel of figure  [ dominant_period ] ) .",
    "it is clear that the observed dominant periodicities closely follow the acoustic cut - off period , thus remaining consistent with the work of @xcite , and highlighting the importance of being able to accurately relate chromospheric phenomena to the underlying photospheric magnetic field geometry .    from the structure of a sunspot , it is clear that rpws observed at increasing distances from the umbral barycenter",
    "will have travelled along magnetic field lines that are more inclined to the solar normal .",
    "this has direct consequences on the acoustic cut - off period , and as a result , longer periods are found at increasing distances from the umbral barycenter , producing a gradual change in the observed period when the magnetic field inclination angles are slowly varying ( see , e.g. , the black line in the lower panel of figure  [ dominant_period ] ) .",
    "however , when a more - rapidly varying magnetic field geometry is present , such as that corresponding to the n region of the sunspot under investigation , the resulting period  distance diagram ( middle panel of figure  [ dominant_period ] ) clearly reflects this magnetic complexity by revealing a distinct kink in the resulting relationship . here , a rapid , localised inclination of the magnetic field lines results in a faster increase in the dominant periodicity due to the reduced cut - off frequency , @xmath108 . the fact that the observed wave periods can be accurately constrained by the magnetic field inclination angles and the associated cut - off period , implies , at least for the sunspot under investigation , that its low-@xmath7 nature allows it to be accurately modelled using force - free magnetic field extrapolations , ultimately providing the ability to directly relate chromospheric phenomena to the underlying photospheric magnetic field complexity .",
    "interestingly , the magnetograms displayed in figure  [ magnetogram ] also shine light on the intricate structuring present in the h@xmath22 image displayed in the upper - middle panel of figure  [ images ] .",
    "it appears that the h@xmath22 canopy structure has termination points visible in the north - west and south - east corners of the field - of - view .",
    "figure  [ magnetogram ] clearly reveals that these regions contain pockets of high unipolar magnetic field strength , which are often the locations of concentrated groups of magnetic bright points @xcite .",
    "in addition , these features typically give rise to localized regions of high oscillatory power ( see the high oscillatory power present in the north - west and south - east corners of the fourier power maps displayed in figure  [ images ] ) , which explains the presence of such oscillatory phenomena in these corners of the field - of - view .",
    "the termination of h@xmath22 canopy structures and the manifestation of high oscillatory power are consistent with previous studies of magnetic bright point groups @xcite .",
    "we also suggest that the reverse approach can be implemented to obtain key information on the magnetic field geometries surrounding sunspots .",
    "in such a `` reverse '' regime , the presence of a kink in a period  distance diagram , the precise location of the kink , in addition to the gradients before and after the kink can all be used to provide valuable structural information related to the underlying magnetic field geometry . by establishing the permitted wave periods ,",
    "the spatial variance of the magnetic field strengths , the cut - off periods , and thus the orientation of the underlying magnetic fields can be estimated directly .",
    "importantly , the derived relationships between the underlying magnetic field geometries connecting the photosphere to the chromosphere , and the characteristics of rpws observed in the upper chromosphere , directly supports the interpretation of @xcite that these phenomena are the chromospheric signature of upwardly - propagating magneto - acoustic waves generated in the photosphere .",
    "we have combined one of the highest resolution solar instruments currently available with a series of detailed computations to show that the observed variations in rpw periods can be explained by the influence of the low - frequency acoustic cut - off period . in the vicinity of the sunspot ,",
    "the dominant periods are determined by the acoustic cut - off , which is directly influenced by the local inclination angles of the magnetic fields to the solar normal .",
    "waves which pass this filtering selection criteria are then allowed to be channelled into the chromosphere where they are observed as rpws .",
    "a kink in the period  distance relationship for rpws may be found if the magnetic field geometry changes rapidly over a relatively short distance .",
    "this kink can be more or less pronounced depending on the field inclination angles , and their associated rate of change , present in a particular locality .",
    "importantly , this means that the spatial distribution of dominant wave periods directly reflects the magnetic geometry of the underlying sunspot , thus opening up a wealth of possibilities in future mhd - seismology studies .    using dedicated fourier filtering algorithms ,",
    "we have accurately measured the period - dependent phase velocity of rpws .",
    "the shortest period waves ( @xmath4@xmath42s ) have a phase velocity of @xmath30@xmath58  kms@xmath3 , while the longest period waves ( @xmath4@xmath45s ) demonstrate a phase velocity of @xmath30@xmath59  kms@xmath3 .",
    "in addition , the intrinsic relationships we find between the underlying magnetic field geometries connecting the photosphere to the chromosphere , and the characteristics of rpws observed in the upper chromosphere , directly supports the interpretation that these phenomena are the chromospheric signature of upwardly - propagating magneto - acoustic waves generated in the photosphere .",
