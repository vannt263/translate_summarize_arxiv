    "the hubbard model @xcite has been comprehensively studied over the last decades @xcite .",

    "so far the exact solution has been obtained only in 1d case @xcite , including the solution for the case of hubbard model in external magnetic field @xcite . as far as 2d systems are concerned , the mermin - wagner theorem about the absence of magnetic ordering for non - zero temperatures is worthy to mention @xcite . in turn , for the systems being in the ground state , the lieb theorems @xcite have been formulated .    regarding implications for the magnetism , it has been shown that for the hubbard parameter @xmath1 ( and @xmath2 ) the so - called @xmath3 model @xcite can be derived , which , for half - band filling is equivalent to the model of isotropic heisenberg antiferromagnet @xcite . in turn , for @xmath1 ( and @xmath4 ) the hubbard hamiltonian becomes equivalent to that of xxz model @xcite .",
    "parallel to the exact ( or rigorous ) results mentioned above , the approximate methods , both analytic and numerical , have been developed with different success . among them",
    "the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods @xcite and dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) @xcite deserve particular attention .",
    "the possible extensions of the domain where the exact solutions can be found for the model includes the zero - dimensional , cluster systems ( see for example @xcite ) as well as clusters embedded in the environment of localized spins @xcite .",
    "it is worthy to mention that the studies of such geometrically confined , cluster systems are important from the point of view of nanophysics and nanotechnology . in particular , it has been shown in @xcite that for some small number of electrons the analytic solutions can be obtained in addition to the numerical calculations .",
    "the magnetic field has been taken into account in @xcite , however , the influence of the external electric field on the cluster properties has not been studied there .",
    "motivated by such a possibility , we undertake the exact study of the hubbard simplest cluster , namely the pair ( or dimer ) , embedded simultaneously in the external magnetic and electric fields .",
