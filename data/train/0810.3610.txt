    "an early measurement of the inclusive w and z production cross section in leptonic decay channels is presented , assuming 10 pb@xmath0 data at lhc .",
    "signature of high transverse momentum leptons from w and z decays is very distinctive in the environment of hadron collisions . as such ,",
    "the decays of w and z bosons into leptons provide a clean experimental measurement of their production rate . the @xmath1 cross section can be calculated using the following formula ( a similar formula can be used for the z cross section ) : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the number of candidates selected from the data , @xmath4 represents the expected background events and @xmath5 is the acceptance defined as the fraction of these decays satisfying the geometric constraints of the detector and the kinematic constraints of the imposed selection criteria .",
    "the @xmath6 is the selection efficiency for w decays falling within the acceptance and @xmath7 is the integrated luminosity .",
    "the @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 in the following ) samples are selected from events that pass the single isolated electron high level trigger  @xcite .",
    "we require one ( for @xmath8 ) or two ( for @xmath11 ) high-@xmath12 electrons formed from the association of a high @xmath13 supercluster in the @xmath14 crystal electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) and a high-@xmath12 gsf track in the tracker .",
    "an ecal supercluster gathers the energy deposited in a region around the main energy cluster in an attempt to recover most of the energy of bremsstrahlung photons emitted along the electron trajectory .",
    "the momentum of a gsf track is fitted along its trajectory using a gaussian - sum filter algorithm ( gsf ) dealing with the possible emission of hard bremsstrahlung photons in the scattering layers of the tracker .",
    "the electron(s ) should fall within the ecal fiducial region ( @xmath15 2.5 , excluding the barrel - endcap transition region ) .",
    "the ecal supercluster(s ) should have a transverse energy @xmath16 20.0 ( 30.0 ) gev for @xmath11 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "since the electrons from the z and w decays are isolated , we demand low charged particle activity in a cone around each electron candidates . the reconstructed @xmath17 distribution for the signal and the various backgrounds for events passing the @xmath11 selection is shown in fig .  [ zeeinvmass ] .",
    "an invariant mass cut of 70 - 110 gev is applied .",
    "the background after selection is negligible .    in order to select the @xmath18 sample ,",
    "we require two isolated muons with tracks reconstructed from hits in both the tracker system and the muon chambers .",
    "the muons must satisfy a cut on the transverse momentum : @xmath19  20  gev .",
    "the isolation criteria requires the @xmath12 sum of all tracks in a cone around the muon direction to be less than 3 gev .",
    "the invariant mass of the @xmath20 pair must be greater than 40 gev .",
    "[ wmunumet ] shows the reconstructed transverse mass , @xmath21 , of the w system after @xmath22 selection cuts .",
    "the w system is built in the plane transverse to the beam by combining the measured muon and the missing transverse energy in the event .",
    "the latter is interpreted as a measurement of the transverse momentum of the undetected neutrino .",
    "muons must satisfy the cuts : @xmath19 25 gev and @xmath23 2 and be isolated .",
    "the isolation criteria for @xmath22 requires the @xmath12 sum of all tracks cone around the muon direction , normalized to the muon @xmath12 , to be less than 0.09 .",
    "the figure shows that the qcd background is largely suppressed with the cut @xmath24 50 gev .",
    "a full description of the selection is described in @xcite for electron channels and in @xcite for muon channels .",
    "the efficiency of trigger , lepton reconstruction and selection can be measured directly from data using the tag and probe method  @xcite .",
    "the method relies upon @xmath25 decays to provide an unbiased , high - purity , lepton sample with which to measure the efficiency of a particular cut or trigger .",
    "one of the leptons , the `` tag '' , is required to pass stringent lepton identification criteria whilst the other lepton , the `` probe '' , is only required to satisfy a set of criteria depending on the efficiency under study . + fig .",
    "[ tapmuon ] shows the single muon trigger efficiencies measured .",
    "it is computed on a @xmath18 sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 10 pb@xmath0 .",
    "the results are shown as a function of the muon pseudorapidity . the good agreement observed between the measured reconstruction efficiencies using tag and probe method and the efficiencies evaluated using the monte carlo generator level information",
    "is interpreted as a validation of the method .",
    "electroweak background in @xmath26 is small and can be estimated with adequate precision from simulation . on the other hand",
    "the qcd backgroud is hard to estimate and control from simulation and therefore must be measured from the data .",
    "a missing transverse energy ( transverse mass ) template for the background is obtained requiring the full set of selection criteria but reverting the @xmath27 ( muon isolation ) one in the electron ( muon ) channel . to obtain the signal missing transverse energy ( transverse mass ) template",
