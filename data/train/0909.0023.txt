    "higher dimensional theories offer new avenues to address longstanding fine tuning problems .",
    "regarding the gauge hierarchy problem , there are now other possible solutions in addition to 4d supersymmetry , such as the randall - sundrum @xcite and the large extra dimensions scenario @xcite ( which requires , in its minimal formulation , at least two extra dimensions ) . still the cosmological constant problem remains an unsolved issue in theoretical physics .    a combination of the concepts of supersymmetry and ( large ) extra dimensions has been proposed @xcite as a way to attack the cosmological constant problem , postulating two extra dimensions and codimension two 3-branes . whether this approach can be successful ,",
    "it is still unclear ( for criticisms and replies see e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) , however , an interesting property of this scenario would be the prediction of the kaluza - klein ( kk ) scale at @xmath0ev .",
    "one immediate consequence would be the onset of deviations from standard gravity at that scale , which corresponds to the submillimeter .",
    "thus , a natural question is whether the matching with experimental and observational tests of gravity can impose ( additional ) tuning of the brane tensions , once a 4d flat background solution is chosen .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to answer this question by considering a realization of 6d supergravity called the salam - sezgin model @xcite ( and its anomaly free @xcite extensions @xcite ) .",
    "string theory derivations of this 6d supergravity have been provided @xcite and its vacuum structure has been investigated in great detail .",
    "gibbons , gven and pope ( ggp ) proved @xcite that the only smooth solution of the salam - sezgin model is the 4d flat unwarped space with internal spherical geometry and a non vanishing gauge field @xcite .",
    "as soon as 3-branes are introduced , conical singularities are generated and the most general solution with 4d poincar symmetry and axial symmetry in the internal space has been derived @xcite ( we consider this class of solutions here and refer to it as the ggp solution ) .",
    "there are no solutions of the salam - sezgin model having a curved 4d space with maximal symmetry and without singularities stronger than conical @xcite .",
    "these properties render the ggp solution an interesting set of configurations , whose 4d spectrum has been indeed studied in a series of works @xcite .    here",
    "we focus on the minimal coupling between gravity and branes required by general covariance and compute the brane interactions mediated by massive kk gravitons .",
    "we derive their general form at the leading order in perturbation theory and their corrections to newton s law on the brane .",
    "we show that these quantities can be independent of the brane tensions and we comment on the physical implications of this property .",
    "the origin of such independence is identified with the presence of codimension two branes on a compact space .",
    "we consider a class of models in @xmath1 dimensions possessing 3-brane solutions with 4d poincar invariance .",
    "the complete ( covariant ) action is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the bulk action ( see below for specific forms ) and @xmath4 is the brane one : s_b = d^4 x ( -t+ i(x ) ) , [ sb]where @xmath5 is the determinant of the brane metric , defined in terms of the higher dimensional metric @xmath6 by @xcite : g_g_mn(y(x))_y^m(x ) _",

    "the function @xmath12 instead can be a generic functional of @xmath13 and additional brane fields @xmath14 , but below we will consider it as a gravitational source localized on the brane .",
    "the constant @xmath15 is the brane tension that may include the vacuum energy produced by the brane fields .",
    "it is trivial to generalize this to an arbitrary number of branes : all we have to do is to add an index to the various quantities appearing in ( [ sb ] ) , but from now on ( unless otherwise stated ) we suppress it .",

    "also we will focus on the bosonic bulk dynamics , as , in our setup , only bosons couple to the brane sources . the bulk fields ( which depend on all the space - time coordinates @xmath17 ) include , in addition to the higher dimensional metric , the gauge field @xmath18 of a compact lie group @xmath19 . in order to complete the bosonic part of 6d supergravity",

    "in general one can also add some hypermultiplets @xcite , which turn out to be important to cancel gauge and gravitational anomalies @xcite . in the bosonic sector",

    "so after the compactification we have the same number of independent parameters , which can be taken as _ 4 , r_0 , g,t , , [ parametersac]but with the topological constraint ( [ topological ] ) . in section [ gravity - spin-2 ]",
    "we shall see that the gravitational interactions mentioned in the introduction are independent of @xmath15 and @xmath48 ( and obviously of @xmath59 because 4d gravitons are not charged under any 6d gauge group ) .",
    "the ggp solutions solve the 6d supergravity equations in the absence of external sources ( other than pure tensions ) , that is for @xmath63 .",
    "however , below we will consider perturbations that include couplings between bulk fields and gravitational sources on the brane .",
    "in order to study the massive graviton interactions between sources we have to expand the theory in powers of small fluctuations around the background solutions . in particular , regarding the bulk metric , we substitute g_mn g_mn + h_mn[metricpert ] in the action , so that we can interpret @xmath6 as the background metric and @xmath64 as the small fluctuation .",

    "this implies that no tuning of the brane tensions are required to match observations and experiments with the above - mentioned interactions .",
    "a key feature that has led to this result is the codimension two nature of our branes , and the fact that they live on a compact space ( the compactness is required to have a discrete spectrum ) .",
    "indeed , the same phenomenon does not arise in the classic codimension one scenarios such as randall - sundrum models , where e.g. short distance precision tests of gravity lead to bounds on the brane tensions .",
    "these results support the idea that in such models the gravitational interactions are decoupled from the brane vacuum energy .      if @xmath156 , brane interactions mediated by 4d scalars coming from the bulk generically emerge .",
    "the proper treatment of this contribution requires a way to remove the singularities due to the codimension two branes , which emerge in the scalar sector @xcite .",
    "different ways of dealing with these singularities can lead to different physical predictions ; therefore , we focused here on the sector ( graviton interactions ) that is independent of the regularization procedure .",
    "there are nevertheless physical situations where one can take @xmath157 , such as the light bending due to massive sources .",
    "also , this type of supergravity models predicts classically massless scalar particles , which could modify the large distance behaviour of gravity . a way to lift these marginal directions , and deal at the same time with the singularities sourced by codimension two branes , has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "however , some difficulties emerge in reconciling this approach with the smallness of the cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "we leave this point as an open issue .",
