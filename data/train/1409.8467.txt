    "the incorporation of small concentrations of bismuth ( bi ) into gaas to form the highly - mismatched dilute bismide alloy gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 results in a rapid reduction of the band gap ( @xmath5 ) with increasing bi composition @xmath4 , of 70  80 mev per % bi replacing as in the alloy at low @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite this decrease in @xmath5 is accompanied by a strong increase of the spin - orbit - splitting energy ( @xmath6 ) , @xcite which leads to a band structure in which @xmath7 for @xmath8% .",
    "@xcite this band structure condition makes dilute bismide alloys an attractive candidate material system for applications in gaas - based semiconductor lasers operating at mid - infrared wavelengths due to the possibility to suppress the dominant non - radiative recombination pathway .",
    "@xcite moreover , the increased spin - orbit coupling in dilute bismide alloys could lead to the development of spintronic devices based on the rashba spin - orbit interaction requiring shorter channel lengths or reduced modulation electric field strengths compared to existing gaas - based devices .",
    "@xcite as a result of this and other potential applications , research interest in dilute bismide alloys has been steadily increasing in recent years .    as a result of the large differences in size and chemical properties between bi atoms and the as atoms they replace , bi acts as an isovalent impurity in gaas which strongly perturbs the valence band ( vb ) structure .",
    "an explanation of the observed strong , composition - dependent bowing of @xmath5 and @xmath6 in gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 has been proposed @xcite in the form of a band anti - crossing interaction between the extended vb edge states of the gaas host matrix , and highly localized bi - related impurity states which are resonant with the gaas vb .",
    "the situation in disordered gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 alloys is more complicated , where the reduction in symmetry brought about through alloy disorder has significant effects on the electronic properties .",
    "@xcite    the land g factor of conduction electrons ( @xmath0 ) is a key parameter in semiconductor materials , describing the response of the electron spins to externally applied magnetic fields , as well as providing useful information regarding the symmetry of the electron and hole states at the @xmath9 point in the brillouin zone .",
    "therefore , in addition to providing information pertinent to evaluating the potential of specific materials for spintronic applications , analysis of the electron spin properties and g factor gives insight into the material band structure , providing valuable data for material characterization and modeling .",
    "@xcite in particular , @xmath0 is extremely sensitive to the separation in energy between the conduction band ( cb ) minimum and the light - hole ( lh ) , heavy - hole ( hh ) and spin - split - off ( so ) bands , as well as hybridization between these bands caused by , e.g. , a reduction of crystal symmetry due to pseudomorphic strain .",

    "our measurements showed that the magnitude of @xmath11 increases strongly with increasing bi composition @xmath4 in gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 , primarily due to the increase in the strength of the spin - orbit coupling with increasing @xmath4 . in this article",

    "our theoretical calculations explain the measured variation of @xmath0 with bi composition @xmath4 in terms of the effects of epitaxial strain and bi - induced mixing of vb states due to alloy disorder . by employing large supercell calculations containing 4096 atoms",

    "optical excitation was provided via 1.5 ps long pulses generated by a mode - locked ti : al@xmath13o@xmath14 laser with 80 mhz repetition frequency .",
    "the excitation wavelength was fixed at 795 nm and the beam was focused on a 50 @xmath15 m diameter spot on the sample surface .",
    "the polarization of the exciting beam ( linear or circular ) was set by a combination of a linear polarizer and a quarter - wave plate , while the degree of circular polarization was obtained by passing the pl signal through another quarter - wave plate followed by a linear polarizer .",
    "the pl signals were recorded using a s1 photocathode streak camera with an overall temporal resolution of 8 ps .    for the measurement of the anisotropic electron g factor continuous external magnetic fields up to 0.73 t",

    "@xcite we note that , in this range of magnetic field intensities , the binding energy of excitons is not strengthened by landau quantization effects .",
    "@xcite the incident laser beam was circularly polarized . in the voigt configuration , the light propagation was along the sample growth ( @xmath17- ) direction while in the tilted configuration , due to the high refractive index of gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 , the light propagated at an angle of approximately @xmath18 from the growth direction . in this case , the circular polarization of the exciting light was still close to 100% , and the mean electron spin orientation was almost entirely along the @xmath17-axis .",
    "the samples were mounted in a closed cycle he - cooled cryostat , and the temperature varied from 100 to 300 k. based on an analysis of the low temperature pl @xcite the temperatures and excitation intensities for the experiments were chosen in order to minimize both excitonic effects and the effects of radiative recombination via localized states .",

    "since the value of @xmath0 is strongly dependent upon the material band gap and spin - orbit - splitting energies , @xcite photo - modulated reflectance ( pr ) measurements were carried out on each of the samples , which enabled both @xmath5 and @xmath6 to be measured accurately .",
