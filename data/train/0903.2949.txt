    "thus , particles 1 and 2 are identical , and so are 3 and 4 .",

    "coupling the color states of the quark pair with that of the antiquark pair must yield a color singlet .",

    "[ pepe ]      as thoroughly discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to discriminate between four  quark bound states and simple pieces of the meson - meson continuum , one has to carefully determine the two - meson states that constitute the thresholds for each set of quantum numbers . dealing with strongly interacting particles ,",
    "the two - meson states should have well defined total angular momentum ( @xmath66 ) , parity ( @xmath1 ) , and a properly symmetrized wave function if two identical mesons are considered ( spin - statistics theorem ) . when noncentral forces are not taken into account , orbital angular momentum ( @xmath67 ) and total spin ( @xmath0 ) are also good quantum numbers .",
    "we give in tables  [ th1 ] ,  [ th2 ] ,  [ th3 ] ,  [ th2b ] , and  [ th3b ] the lowest threshold in both cases , that we will refer to as coupled ( co ) and uncoupled ( un ) schemes respectively , together with the final state relative orbital angular momentum of the decay products .",
    "we would like to emphasize that although we use central forces in our calculation the co scheme is the relevant one for observations , since a small non - central component in the potential is enough to produce a sizeable effect on the width of a state . in table",
    "[ th1 ] we summarize the thresholds obtained using the experimental energies given in ref .  @xcite . in tables",
    "[ th2 ] and  [ th3 ] we quote the thresholds obtained with the cqc model for the charm and bottom sectors respectively , and in tables  [ th2b ] and  [ th3b ] those for the bcn model .",
    "an important property of the @xmath2 system , that is crucial for the possible existence of bound states , is the fact that only one physical threshold @xmath68 is allowed .",
    "consequently , particular modifications of the four  quark interaction , for instance a strong color - dependent attraction in the @xmath69 pair , would not be translated into any asymptotically free two - meson state . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this is not a general property in the four  quark spectroscopy , as the @xmath70 four  quark state has two allowed physical thresholds : @xmath71 and @xmath72 .      the relevant quantity for analyzing the stability of any four  quark state is @xmath73 , the energy difference between the mass of the four  quark system and that of the lowest two - meson threshold , @xmath74 where @xmath75 stands for the four  quark energy and @xmath76 for the energy of the two - meson threshold .",
    "thus , @xmath77 indicates that all fall - apart decays are forbidden , and therefore one has a proper bound state .",
    "@xmath78 will indicate that the four  quark solution corresponds to an unbound threshold ( two free mesons ) .",
    "one of the main difficulties in studying four  quark states , already discussed in refs .",

    "@xcite through an extrapolation of the four  quark energy using the expression @xmath80 where @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are fitted parameters . when this extrapolation is used for unbound states",
    ", one can observe how the four  quark energies reproduce the thresholds to within a few mev .    a second important quantity to characterize the possible existence of a bound state",
    "is the evolution of the root mean square radius as a function of @xmath51 . while for unbound states",
    ", the components of the four - quark state will tend to be far away when increasing @xmath51 , for a bound state the radius should stabilize when increasing @xmath51 . in order to compare four  quark against two free  meson states we define the root mean square radius for four ( two ) quark systems @xmath84 and its corresponding ratio @xmath85 where @xmath86 stands for the sum of the radii of the mesons corresponding to the lowest threshold .      besides trying to unravel the possible existence of bound @xmath2 states",
    "one should try to understand whether it is possible to differentiate between compact and molecular states .",
    "a molecular state may be understood as a four  quark state containing a single physical two - meson component , i.e. , a unique singlet - singlet component in the color wave function with well - defined spin and isospin quantum numbers .",
    "one could expect these states not being deeply bound and therefore having a size of the order of the two - meson system , i.e. , @xmath87 .",
    "opposite to that , a compact state may be characterized by its involved structure on the color space , its wave function containing different singlet - singlet components with non negligible probabilities .",
    "one would expect such states would be smaller than typical two - meson systems , i.e. , @xmath88 .",
    "let us notice that while @xmath89 but finite would correspond to a meson - meson molecule @xmath90 would represent an unbound threshold .",
    "one may illustrate the situation described above by the deuteron and the @xmath39-dibaryon examples .",
    "let us try to draw the analogy between these states and the @xmath91 system .",
    "the deuteron has a small binding energy of @xmath922.225 mev and a ratio between its root mean square charge radius ( 2.139 fm ) and the one of two protons ( 1.75 fm ) of 1.222  @xcite , @xmath93 and @xmath942.225 mev in our notation .",
    "should the deuteron be considered as a pure baryon - baryon molecule ?",
    "although ref .",
    "@xcite emphasized the difficulties to identify pure hadron - hadron molecules close to thresholds , in the deuteron case it was long - ago justified  @xcite .",
    "the probability of physical two - baryon states other than nucleon - nucleon is meaningless  @xcite .",
    "therefore it constitutes a clear example of a molecular state .",
    "the postulated @xmath39-dibaryon would however fit into the picture of compact states , its wave function presenting relevant components of different singlet - singlet physical channels : @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 at least  @xcite .",
    "this last aspect makes contact with the role played by hidden - color configurations , color singlets built by nonsinglet constituents .",
    "there are three different ways for coupling two quarks and two antiquarks in a colorless state , @xmath98&=&\\{{|\\bar 3_{12}3_{34}\\rangle},{|6_{12}\\bar 6_{34}\\rangle}\\}\\cr [ ( q_1\\bar q_3)(q_2\\bar q_4)]&=&\\{{|1_{13}1_{24}\\rangle},{|8_{13}8_{24}\\rangle}\\}\\cr [ ( q_1\\bar q_4)(q_2\\bar q_3)]&=&\\{{|1_{14}1_{23}\\rangle},{|8_{14}8_{23}\\rangle}\\ } \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] each coupling scheme allows to define a color basis where the four  body problem can be solved .",
    "the first basis , @xmath99 $ ] , being the most suitable one to deal with the pauli principle , is made entirely by hidden  color vectors .",
    "the other two are hybrid basis that contain both singlet  singlet ( physical ) and octect  octect ( hidden  color ) components .",
    "it is possible to prove from simple group theory arguments that once we have solved the four  body problem for a system composed of two identical quarks ( @xmath69 ) and two identical antiquarks ( @xmath100 ) , there is a minimum value for the octect ",
    "octect component probability of the wave function either in the @xmath101 $ ] or the @xmath102 $ ] couplings : @xmath103 $ ] .",
    "it can also be proved that for a four - quark threshold state @xmath104 .",
    "does this imply an important hidden  color component in all @xmath2 states ?",
    "the answer is no . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was proved than any physical state can be expanded in terms of a basis constructed by direct product of mesonic and/or baryonic states not necessarily linearly independent .",

    "the ground state of systems made of two quarks and two antiquarks of equal masses was found to be below the dissociation threshold .",

    "expected bound states are summarized in table  [ tres-8 ] .",
    "the possible existence of a four  quark state with these quantum numbers was predicted more than twenty years ago by zouzou and collaborators  @xcite . since then , several works have been devoted to study these particular quantum numbers by means of different methods and interactions , either in the charm or in the bottom sector  @xcite . in table",

    "the predicted binding energy is large , @xmath92 76 mev , and @xmath158 , what would fit into the defined compact states .",
    "opposite to that , the bcn model predicts a rather small binding , @xmath927 mev , and the rms is larger than one but still not converged , although not increasing linearly .",
    "this state would naturally correspond to a molecule .",
    "although this state would be stable against dissociation into two mesons , it may decay electromagnetically or weakly . the electromagnetic transition @xmath159 would be allowed if @xmath75 is larger than the mass of two @xmath144 mesons .",
    "the process is illustrated in the upper part of figure  [ fig7 ] . for the cqc model",
    "the four  quark energy is below the @xmath160 threshold and therefore the predicted state could only decay via a second order weak process into either two kaons ( cabibbo allowed ) or two light mesons ( cabibbo suppressed ) . the process is illustrated in the bottom part of figure  [ fig7 ] .",
    "opposite to that , the results of the bcn model allow for an electromagnetic decay with the emission of a photon with an energy lower than 127 mev in the @xmath13 rest frame .",
    "bound states have been obtained either with the cqc or the bcn models or with both . in these cases a detailed analysis of the possible thresholds is required .",
    "as previously noticed , the interacting models only consider central terms , @xmath67 and @xmath0 being proper quantum numbers .",
    "however , as illustrated is sec .",
    "[ thre ] the thresholds may be different in the coupled or uncoupled schemes , the former one being the relevant when trying to compare with experiment .",
    "we show in the upper part of table  [ tres-7 ] the results obtained compared to the threshold in the uncoupled and coupled schemes .",
    "the differences are noticeable , when the coupled scheme is used both interacting models give results above the corresponding lowest threshold , what discard these quantum numbers as promising candidates for being observed experimentally .    as already discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec4a ] , increasing the mass of the heavy quark will favor the binding .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] comparing the four - quark energy of the @xmath162 state to its uncoupled threshold in the cqc model .",
    "as can be seen the cqc model predicts a tiny binding energy , but the extrapolation gives a very stable value around @xmath163 mev .",
    "opposite to the case of unbound states , the rms does not grow linearly with @xmath51 .",
    "we observe the changes in @xmath73 when increasing @xmath164 , noting how @xmath73 crosses zero for masses slightly below the charm quark mass .",
    "as a consequence , all the states discussed in this section might be candidates to be stable in the bottom sector due to the binding gained with the heavy quark mass .",
    "we repeat the same analysis as before for the bottom sector . expected bound states",
    "are summarized in table  [ tres-8 ] .",
    "opposite to the charm sector , in the bottom sector both quark models offer the same prediction , a compact deeply bound four  quark state . within the cqc model the binding energy",
    "gets a value of @xmath92214 mev while bcn predicts a somewhat smaller value of @xmath92144 mev . concerning the possible decays ,",
    "both of them are also below the threshold for electromagnetic decays into @xmath165 ( 10588 mev for cqc and 10602 mev for bcn ) and therefore the only allowed decay mode for this state will involve a second order weak process into two open - charm ( cabibbo allowed ) or two light mesons ( cabibbo suppressed ) .      the existence of a positive parity @xmath2 bound state with quantum numbers @xmath168 and @xmath10 was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite using the bcn model if the ratio between the masses of the heavy and light quarks was larger than 5@xmath9210 , i.e. , @xmath169 and heavier .",
    "we have obtained a similar limit for the cqc model , @xmath170 .    for the @xmath171 state",
    "a bound state has also been found using both models , being @xmath172 mev and @xmath173 mev , respectively . as can be seen in table  [ tres-7 ]",
    "it is the only member of a multiplet below all possible thresholds and therefore all strong decays are forbidden .",
    "no bound states were observed in the charm sector with these quantum numbers , being therefore consequence of the binding gained due to the larger heavy quark mass . both states would present electromagnetic decays , the former one @xmath174 , with a photon energy in the range of @xmath175 mev , and the latter through @xmath176 or @xmath177 emitting a photon of the order of @xmath178 mev .",
    "although no bound state is observed in the @xmath13 spectra , a bound state , @xmath180 mev , appears in the bottom sector with the cqc model .",
    "the structure of the wave function , @xmath181 , clearly points to an extended meson  meson molecule instead of a compact four  quark state .",
    "concerning its possible decay channels , being this state below all possible thresholds it could only undergo a weak decay .",
    "all these states are predicted to be bound in the uncoupled scheme but none of them survive the coupled thresholds .",
    "although interesting from the theoretical point of view to carefully test our calculating framework , they are not expected to be observed in nature .",
    "once the @xmath2 ( @xmath185 ) states have been discussed , few avenues remain to be explored . among them , the consideration of @xmath186 and @xmath187 states would be of interest .",
    "concerning the strangeness @xmath3 states only those containing @xmath83 quarks seem likely candidates to accommodate bound states .",
    "we have redone the calculation for the most promising states , those with quantum numbers @xmath188 and @xmath189 or @xmath83 . in both cases",
    "the four - quark system is above the corresponding threshold .",
    "this can be easily understood because the mass ratio @xmath190 has diminished due to the large mass of the strange quark , thus increasing the contribution of the kinetic energy .",
    "besides , the attractive one - pion exchange does not contribute .",
    "our conclusions coincide with ref .",
    "@xcite , the binding energy decreases when decreasing the mass ratio @xmath190 . the second system , @xmath187 is made of distinguishable heavy quarks , i.e. , @xmath169 among others , and therefore demands a modification of the current formalism , namely consider all possible combinations of @xmath191 .",
    "this would lead to an increase in the basis size and consequently in computing time .",
    "however , one can draw a simple conclusion in light of ref .",
    "@xcite , or the first six lines of table iii .",
    "the binding energy increases with the reduced mass of the heavy quark pair .",
    "thus , one would expect a bound state with quantum numbers @xmath157 for the @xmath169 system , while the others appearing in the doubly - bottom sector would not be clear candidates for bound states with a @xmath192 heavy diquark .",
    "we present in table  [ pro ] the meson - meson probabilities for some selected four  quark states according to eqs .",
    "( [ proeq ] ) .",
    "these calculations where done by means of the variational method , ref .  @xcite . as can be seen",
    "there is a perfect agreement with the hh results but the variational formalism allows to evaluate the probabilities of the different physical components in a simpler manner .",
    "unbound states converge to two isolated mesons , the lowest threshold of the system , its rms and @xmath193 being very large .",
    "in contrast , bound states have a radius smaller than the threshold and they present probabilities different from zero for several physical states , the lowest two - meson threshold being contained in the physical four  quark system .",
    "such states would be called compact in our notation .",
    "when the binding energy approaches the threshold , the probability of a single physical channel converges to one , what we defined as a molecular state .",
    "the delicate interplay between the oge and the chiral interactions in the description of the hadron spectra and baryon - baryon interaction has been widely discussed in the literature  @xcite . in the @xmath2 spectra the relative strength of these interactions is even more important since @xmath73 is very sensitive to any modification in the chiral / oge rate .",
    "the reason is that the threshold is not affected by the chiral part of the interaction since it is made of two @xmath194 mesons , and there are no boson exchanges between heavy and light quarks .",
    "this is not the case for the @xmath2 systems , where bosons may be exchanged between the two light antiquarks .",
    "therefore , an arbitrary modification in the strength of the chiral part of the interaction in any four  quark state where it is attractive , could bind the system .",
    "we therefore emphasize the importance of testing any model against as many observables as possible in order to constraint its parameters and ingredients . in this respect the heavy ",
    "light four  quark states are ideally suited for this task .",
    "since only the total energy , and not the threshold , depends on the boson exchanges , the comparison between the predicted and measured @xmath73 would provide us with precise information regarding the role played by these interactions in the meson spectra .",
    "amazingly , as observed in table  [ tres-8 ] almost all bound states are predicted independently of the dynamics .",
    "in other words , whenever a bound state is found with the cqc model , the bcn potential predicts a similar state .",
    "in general predicted binding energies are smaller for gluon - based interactions .",
    "only the @xmath179 @xmath12 state is predicted by one of the models , the cqc . to illustrate the larger binding predicted by models considering boson exchanges",
    "we have selected one of the states whose binding energy in the uncoupled scheme has been found to be smaller than 10 mev , the @xmath12 @xmath182 .",
    "once boson exchanges are switched off the state lacks of enough attraction to be bound , behaving like two isolated mesons .",
    "these results are illustrated in table [ tres-9 ] .",
    "to illustrate the difference in the structure induced by the boson exchanges we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the evolution with @xmath51 of @xmath193 in both cases . in the unbound case",
    "the system is separating very rapidly while the bound one starts to converge to a large , but finite , value .",
    "the most promising mechanism for the production of a four  quark state is the independent formation of two @xmath195 and @xmath196 pairs to later on merge into a @xmath197 state .",
    "following this idea the rate of @xmath197 production was estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite as @xmath198 .",
    "therefore , any facility able to produce double charm baryons in sizable quantities should be able , in principle , to observe four  quark states .",
    "so far , double charmed baryons have only been observed by selex collaboration @xcite , although its limited statistics , @xmath199 events , makes doubtful that four  quark states can be produced in quantities large enough to be statistically significant . in ref .",
    "@xcite the production rate of double charmed baryons by the compass experiment was estimated to be of the order of @xmath200 to @xmath201 events , this will indicate that up to 1500 four  quark events may be produced by compass 200 gev proton beam  @xcite .",
    "the number of @xmath202 and @xmath203 events at tevatron was estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite , obtaining values of 10@xmath204 and 10@xmath205 events respectively .",
    "this would yield values of the order of @xmath200 four  quark events to be produced in the second run of tevatron .",
    "although so far belle collaboration has not reported the observation of double charmed baryons , their production cross section was estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite , where values of the order of @xmath200 events / year were obtained .",
    "this will translate into 1000 four  quark events / year .",
    "theoretical predictions about the production cross - section of double charmed baryons at babar has been estimated , giving diverse values from hundreds to tens of thousands of events  @xcite .",
    "this will indicate that babar could produce up to 5000 four  quark / events . on this respect",
    "it is worth to mention that theoretical cross - section predictions for double @xmath206 production have been found to be one order of magnitude too low as compared with experimental data  @xcite .",
    "this will imply that the predicted rate for double charmed baryon production may have been underestimated and therefore the expected number of four  quark events could be larger . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath197 production rate at different facilities was estimated assuming that the dominant mechanism for double charm production at high energy colliders would be a disconnected double gluon - gluon fusion , @xmath207 .",
    "the predicted number of four  quark events produced at lhc by either lhcb or alice and at tevatron is found to be very large , 9700 , 20900 , and 600 events / hour respectively , while for rhic they expect a smaller value of 12 events / hour .",
    "the picture that seems to emerge from these estimations is that nowadays we are on the verge where actual experimental facilities may be capable of start disentangling the properties of @xmath197 bound states .",
    "if this is not so , the future facilities that will be in operation in the next decade , if not sooner , at cern and fermilab will be able to provide a definitive answer to the existence of four  quark flavor ",
    "exotic states in nature .",
    "in this work we have performed a systematic analysis of all @xmath13 and @xmath12 ground states within the framework of the hyperspherical harmonic method . in order to distinguish between unbound , compact , and molecular four  quark states",
    "we have considered two different quark models widely used in the literature .",
    "we have analyzed both isoscalar and isovector systems with @xmath0=0 , 1 , and 2 .",
    "we have considered @xmath6 states with positive and negative parity and @xmath134 negative parity ones .",
    "the relevance of a careful analysis of the numerical thresholds together with the numerical approximations involved has been emphasized in order to avoid the misidentification of bound states .",
    "estimations about the possibility to detect these states on the next generation of experimental facilities have been performed .",
    "our results are summarized in table  [ tres-8 ] .",
    "we have found five four - quark states that should be narrow and therefore possible to detect .",
    "four of them are predicted independently of the interacting potential used , either cqc or bcn .",
    "the @xmath179 state is found only with the cqc model .",
    "the @xmath13 system would only have one bound state while up to four could be stable in the @xmath12 system .",
    "all predicted states are compact , only the @xmath179 being molecular .",
    "unfortunately , only one of them , the @xmath13 state with quantum numbers @xmath157 , is within the scope of the experimental facilities that will be available in the near future .",
    "theoretical models point out to the existence of a double charmed isoscalar four  quark bound state with quantum numbers @xmath11 , its properties depending on the quark model considered .",
    "the experimental detection and analysis of four  quark double charmed states will undoubtedly prove to be an invaluable testing ground to severely constraint the different theoretical models and therefore , it will allow to refine the theoretical predictions all over the hadronic spectra .",
