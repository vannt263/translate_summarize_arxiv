    "during the past fifteen years , the study of the properties of flux line liquids in high temperature superconductors ( htscs ) has been one of the most active areas of research in vortex phenomenology . yet , despite an impressive body of literature , both experimental and theoretical , and despite a relatively good understanding of the overall behavior and macroscopic properties of vortex liquids , it seems that the important question of the actual microscopic correlations of flux line trajectories inside such liquids has not been fully understood yet .",
    "indeed , of the several theoretical approaches that have been used to study the properties of liquid vortex matter , one particular approach , which has had a rather strong impact on our present understanding of flux liquids in htscs , is the boson mapping , developed by several authors , @xcite which is based on the observation @xcite that there is a formal mapping between the partition function of a three - dimensional system of interacting flux lines , and the imaginary - time partition function of quantum bosons in two - dimensions . although the boson mapping is ultimately used to find density - density correlation functions , and does not contain , after coarse - graining , any detailed information about flux - line trajectories , it has been argued , @xcite based on the behavior of the structure factor derived in this and other hydrodynamic approaches , @xcite that flux lines wander throughout the sample in a random - walk - like fashion , much in the same way as in a hypothetical  ideal gas \" of noninteracting vortices .",
    "this implies , in particular , that the internal fluctuations of flux lines have an average spatial extent which diverges with the sample thickness @xmath0 .",
    "the above interpretation , and in fact the whole hydrodynamic approach to flux line liquids , suffers from a number of inconsistencies which have been pointed out and discussed in detail in two recent papers by the author .",
    "@xcite in these two articles , the author has proposed a new approach to study three - dimensional flux - line liquids in type ii superconductors which , instead of the density , uses the actual conformation variables of vortices as the fundamental dynamical variables of the flux - line system .",
    "this new approach , which makes contact with the standard theory of classical fluids , is based on the separation of dynamical variables of flux lines into center of mass ( c.m . for short ) and internal modes , and on the observation that the repulsive interactions between flux lines must lead to a certain degree of confinement of the internal modes , whose fluctuations are shown to be bounded and no - longer diverge with the sample thickness .",
    "@xcite this picture is obviously in contradiction with the results of the boson mapping of refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we wish to generalize the methodology developed in these previous studies , ( refs . @xcite and @xcite ) , to study the statics and dynamics of vortex liquids in presence of a random pinning potential . in the static case",
    ", we shall show in particular that disorder leads to an enhancement of the tilt modulus and the confining  mass \" of the internal modes of flux lines , thereby reducing their thermal wandering , but otherwise leaves the analytic form of the structure factor @xmath1 unchanged , contrarily to what has been argued by previous authors based on boson mapping methods @xcite or other hydrodynamic approximations .",
    "@xcite these static results are then generalized to the dynamics of driven vortex liquids in the presence of a random pinning potential .",
    "in contrast to earlier studies of this system , in which the density was used as the fundamental dynamical variable , in our approach flux line trajectories , which are the true dynamical variables of the system , are used throughout .",
    "this enables us to derive the coarse - grained , large scale equation of motion of vortices in the flux liquid in the presence of disorder , in close analogy with earlier work on driven , disordered flux lattices .",

    ". then , before considering the nonequilibrium case of a driven disordered flux liquid , we shall first be interested in the equilibrium dynamics of flux liquids , which we will investigate in quite some detail in sec .",
    "v. such an investigation is not only a natural step toward the more complex disordered case , but is also necessary for the developments to follow , since one needs to correctly specify the near - equilibrium dynamics of the unpinned interacting liquid in order to be able to tackle the out - of - equilibrium driven , disordered case . in sec .",
