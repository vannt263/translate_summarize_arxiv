    ", there are several crucial ingredients that one should incorporate into the design :    ( i ) .",
    "the target object @xmath54 can be allowed to be arbitrary ( but regular ) .",
    "that is , the cloaking device should not be object - dependent . in",
    "what follows , this issue shall be referred to as the target independence for a cloaking device .",

    "for an ideal cloaking device , one can expect the following invisibility performance , @xmath56 however , in practice , especially in order to fulfil the requirements in items ( i ) and ( ii ) above , one can relax the ideal cloaking requirement to be @xmath57 is a set of incident waves consisting of entire solutions to the helmholtz equation .",
    "that is , near - invisibility can be achieved for scattering measurements made with interrogating waves from the set @xmath58 . in",
    "what follows , this issue shall be referred to as the relaxation and approximation for a cloaking device . in this paper , we aim to explore as much as possible the three issues listed above for a practical cloaking scheme .      a region of space is said to be _ cloaked _ if its contents , together with the cloak , are invisible to a particular class of wave measurements .",
    "invisibility cloaking could find striking applications in many areas of science and technology such as radar and sonar , medical imaging , earthquake science and , energy science and engineering , to name just a few .",
    "due to its practical importance , the invisibility cloaking has received great attentions in the literature in recent years , and several cloaking schemes have been proposed , including one based on transformation optics @xcite and another one based on plasmon resonances @xcite .",
    "the plasmonic cloaking uses metamaterials with negative parameters , and can be used to cloak an active source .",
    "we refer to @xcite and the references therein for the existing developments in this direction .",
    "the transformation - optics approach uses the transformation properties of optical parameters via a so - called push - forward to form the cloaking mediums .",
    "the transformation - optics mediums for an ideal cloak are nonnegative , but anisotropic and singular , possessing degeneracy and/or blowup singularities . in order to avoid the singular structures ,",
    "various regularised cloaking schemes have been proposed and investigated in the literature , and instead of ideal cloaking , one considers approximate / near - invisibility cloaking for the regularised constructions .",
    "we refer to@xcite and the references therein for the existing developments in this direction .",
    "though the regularised transformation - optics mediums are nonsingular , they retain the anisotropy , which still poses server difficulties to the practical fabrication . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors propose to further approximate the non - singular anisotropic cloaking mediums by isotropic ones using the theory of effective medium and inverse homogenisation .",
    "this is closely related to the issues of practical feasibility and relaxation / approximation discussed in section 1.1",
    ". however , the isotropic cloaking medium obtained in @xcite through the inverse homogenisation are still nearly - singular in the sense that the ellipticity constants of the cloaking material parameters are asymptotic depending on a regularisation parameter .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the non - singular and isotropic cloaking issue through a different perspective .",
    "we consider the cloaking device in the ideal case directly for a given cloaking medium .",
    "this would lead to an interior transmission eigenvalue problem , which is the one considered in @xcite . in @xcite , the authors consider an interior transmission eigenvalue problem for inhomogeneous media containing sound - soft obstacles .",
    "we connect the theoretical study in @xcite with some important practical application on the invisibility cloaking , and propose a generalised interior transmission eigenvalue problem as well .",
    "the interior transmission eigenvalue problem arising from the study of inverse scattering theory @xcite has also received significant attentions in the literature in recent years @xcite .",
    "indeed , the invisibility cloaking problem is naturally connected to a certain interior transmission eigenvalue problem , as shall be discussed in section 2 .",
    "such an observation was also made in a recent paper @xcite where the authors show that a generic inhomogeneous scatterer with a rectangular support can not be ideally invisible to every incident wave ; that is , it scatters every interrogating wave field .",
    "this idea was further picked up in @xcite where the authors numerically show that ideal invisibility can be achieved for certain wavenumbers with respect to a discrete and finite set of far - field measurement data . in @xcite , from a different perspective , the authors show that if the support of a generic inhomogeneous scatterer possesses certain irregularities including a corner , an edge or a circular cone , then it scatters every interrogating wave field . the corner scattering problem has been quantified in @xcite with stability estimates ; see our remarks after theorem  [ thm:3 ] for more relevant discussions .",
    "our current study shall indicate that an acoustic scatterer , satisfying a certain non - transparency condition , is nearly - invisible with respect to certain incident wave fields .",
    "those incident wave fields are generated from the herglotz - approximation to certain interior transmission eigenfunctions .",
    "furthermore , based on this study , we propose a novel cloaking scheme using non - singular and isotropic cloaking mediums .",
    "the proposed cloaking device takes a three - layer structure with a cloaked region , a lossy layer and a cloaking shell .",
    "the target medium in the cloaked region can be arbitrary but regular , whereas the mediums in the lossy layer and the cloaking shell are both non - singular and isotropic .",
    "to our best knowledge , the results obtained in the current article are new to the literature .",
    "finally , we refer to @xcite for comprehensive surveys on the theoretical and experimental progress on invisibility cloaking in the literature ; and we also refer to @xcite and the references therein for relevant theoretical and computational studies on the interior transmission eigenvalues .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we connect the interior transmission eigenvalue problem with the invisibility cloaking , along with some relevant discussions . in section 3",
    ", we consider the isotropic invisibility cloaking , and establish the near - invisibility results .",
    "section 4 is devoted to numerical verification and demonstration .",
    "let us consider the scattering problem associated with a cloaking device of the form .",

    "similar as before , we let @xmath68 and @xmath69 signify the corresponding scattered wave field and the far - field pattern , respectively . if perfect invisibility is achieved for the scattering system , namely , @xmath70 , then by the rellich theorem ( cf .",

    ", one can readily show that the following pde system holds for @xmath78 , @xmath79 if for a certain @xmath35 , there exists a nontrivial pair of solutions to , then @xmath80 is called an interior transmission eigenvalue associated with @xmath81 , and @xmath82 is called the corresponding pair of transmission eigenfunctions .",
    "it is pointed out that the interior transmission eigenvalue problem with @xmath83 on @xmath67 was first proposed and investigated in @xcite from a theoretical perspective . in this paper",
    ", we shall find some important application of to invisibility cloaking .    according to our discussion above ,",
    "if perfect invisibility is obtained for the scattering system , then one has the eigenfunctions for the interior transmission eigenvalue problem .",
    "however , the existence of interior transmission eigenfunctions for does not necessarily imply perfect invisibility for the scattering system .",
    "nevertheless , we shall show that near - invisibility can still be achieved under certain cirumstances . to that end , we first need to extend the interior transmission eigenfunction @xmath84 to the whole space @xmath15 by the so - called herglotz - approximation to form an incident wave field for . starting",
    "from now and throughout the rest of the paper , we assume that @xmath16 is of class @xmath85 . define @xmath86 @xmath87 is called a herglotz wave function .",
    "we have    [ thm : herg1 ] let @xmath88 denote the space of all herglotz wave functions of the form .",
    "define , respectively , @xmath89 and @xmath90 then @xmath91 is dense in @xmath92 with respect to the topology induced by the @xmath93-norm .",
    "we shall also need to introduce the following non - transparency condition for @xmath94 .",
    "consider the following pde , @xmath95 it is assumed that @xmath96 is not an eigenvalue to in the sense that if @xmath97 , then there exists only a trivial solution to .",
    "hence one has a well - defined dtn map as follows , @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the unique solution to .",
    "moreover , we assume that the pde system , with the dirichlet boundary condition @xmath100 replaced by a neumann boundary condition @xmath101 , is also well - posed .",
    "hence , the ntd map @xmath102 , is also well - defined .",
    "next , we consider the following exterior scattering problem @xmath103 define the exterior dtn map by @xmath104 where @xmath61 is the unique solution to .",
    "it is known that @xmath105 and its inverse @xmath106 are both well - defined ( cf .",
    "then @xmath81 is said to satisfy the non - transparency condition associated with @xmath80 if there holds @xmath107    [ rem : nontransparency ] it can be shown that one must have @xmath108 for any @xmath109 unless @xmath97 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath109 , we let @xmath110 be the solution to , and @xmath111 be the solution to . set @xmath112 . if @xmath113 , then one readily verifies that @xmath114 is the solution to the following system @xmath115 hence , one must have that @xmath116 in @xmath117 ( see section 8 , @xcite ) , which readily implies @xmath97 . hence , it is unobjectionable to claim that the non - transparency condition is a generic condition , when @xmath80 is an interior transmission eigenvalue for @xmath81",
    "nevertheless , we would like to remark that it seems , at least according to our numerical observations , that the non - transparency condition is not satisfied for an inhomogeneous scatterer with an irregular / non - smooth support , say a corner in its support ; see our remarks after theorem  [ thm:3 ] for more relevant discussions .",
    "now , we are in a position to present one of the main theorems of this paper which connects the interior transmission eigenvalue problem to the invisibility cloaking .",
    "[ thm:2 ] let @xmath118 be an interior transmission eigenvalue associated with @xmath81 , and @xmath119 be a corresponding pair of eigenfunctions .",

    "since @xmath130 is an interior transmission eigenvalue associated with @xmath81 and @xmath131 are the corresponding eigenfunctions , we see from that @xmath132 by and setting @xmath133 , we clearly have @xmath134 and moreover @xmath135 by subtracting from , and using the transmission conditions on @xmath72 in , we then obtain @xmath136 next , by noting the non - transparency condition , we first treat the case by assuming that @xmath137 by , we have @xmath138 and hence @xmath139 which then yields @xmath140 combining , and , together with straightforward calculations , one readily has @xmath141 where @xmath126 is a positive constant depending only on @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 .    for the other case with @xmath142 that is @xmath143 by a completely similar argument , one can show that @xmath144 where @xmath126 is a positive constant depending only on @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129",
    ".    that is , one either has or for the exterior scattering system . finally , by the well - posedness of the scattering problem from a sound - hard or sound - soft obstacle ( see @xcite ) , one readily has .",
    "the proof is complete .",
    "now , we let @xmath145 denote the set of all the interior transmission eigenvalues associated with @xmath81 , and set @xmath146 clearly , @xmath147 is a subspace of @xmath148 , and by theorem  [ thm : herg1 ] , for a sufficiently small @xmath120 , we let @xmath149 be an @xmath150-net of @xmath147 in @xmath151 in the sense that for any @xmath152 , there exists a @xmath153 such that @xmath154 by theorem  [ thm:2 ] , one clearly has that    [ thm:3 ] for any @xmath155 associated with an interior transmission eigenvalue @xmath156 , if @xmath81 is non - transparent with respect to @xmath124 , then there holds @xmath157 where @xmath126 is a positive constant depending only on @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 .    therefore , by theorem  [ thm:3 ] , as long as the non - transparency condition holds , the cloaked region @xmath59 with the coating @xmath55 is nearly invisible to the wave interrogation for any incident field from @xmath158 , under the assumption that the cloaked region @xmath59 is isolated from the outer space .",
    "some remarks and discussions are in order .    1 .   clearly , the existence and distribution of interior transmission eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for shall be of crucial importance .",
    "the existence , discreteness and infiniteness of the interior transmission eigenvalues for under general assumptions on @xmath159 and @xmath160 for the case with @xmath83 was established in @xcite .",
    "we believe that the case with @xmath161 on @xmath67 can be treated similarly .",
    "inversely , for certain specific wavenumbers and entire wave fields , the design of @xmath81 such that those wavenumbers and wave fields are the respective interior transmission eigenvalues and eigenfunctions shall also be of great interest for customised invisibility cloaking constructions .",
    "we leave the theoretical investigation on these issues for our future study . in section 4 ,",
    "we present extensive numerical experiments to illustrate the discreteness and infiniteness of @xmath162 , and the validity of theorems  [ thm:2 ] and [ thm:3 ] .",
    "the non - transparency condition is critical for the near - invisibility result in theorem  [ thm:3 ] .",
    "our numerical examples in section 4 indicate that if @xmath163 is smooth / regular , then near - invisibility can be achieved at almost all the computed interior transmission eigenvalues ; whereas if @xmath72 is irregular , say possessing a corner , then near - invisibility generically can not be achieved .",
    "the numerical observation is consistent with the theoretical studies in @xcite .",
    "indeed , as discussed in section 1.2 , it is shown in @xcite that if the support of the scatterer possesses certain irregularities , then it scatters every interrogating wave field . in @xcite",
    ", it is further quantified that the scattered wave field from a corner possesses a positive lower bound .",
    "hence , it might be justifiable to conclude that the non - transparency condition holds true for generic acoustic mediums with smooth / regular supports .",
    "more quantitatively , according to , @xmath164 should be a regular number when @xmath165 and , both @xmath67 and @xmath72 are regular / smooth ; whereas either blows up or becomes very large when @xmath165 and , @xmath67 or @xmath72 are irregular . providing more justifications for the above conclusion",

    "the loss mediums are also regular and isotropic , and moreover for the target - independence consideration of the cloaking device , it should enable the object being cloaked to be arbitrary .",
