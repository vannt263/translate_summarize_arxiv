    "the majority of stars more massive than @xmath08 @xmath1 end their lives as core - collapse supernovae .",
    "they have long attracted the attention of astrophysicists because they have many facets playing important roles in astrophysics .",
    "they are the mother of neutron stars as well as black holes ; they play an important role for acceleration of cosmic rays ; they influence galactic dynamics triggering further star formation ; they are gigantic emitters of neutrinos and gravitational waves .",
    "they are also a major site for nucleosynthesis , so , naturally , any attempt to address human origins may need to begin with an understanding of core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) .",
    "current estimates of ccsn rates in our galaxy predict one event every @xmath2 year @xcite . when a ccsn event occurs in our galactic center ,",
    "copious numbers of neutrinos are produced , some of which may be detected on the earth .",
    "such `` supernova neutrinos '' will carry valuable information from deep inside the core .",
    "in fact , the detection of neutrinos from sn1987a ( albeit in the large magellanic cloud ) opened up the _ neutrino astronomy _ , which is an alternative to conventional astronomy by electromagnetic waves @xcite .",
    "even though there were just two dozen neutrino events from sn1987a , these events have been studied extensively ( yielding @xmath0 500 papers ) and have allowed us to have a confidence that our basic picture of the supernova physics is correct ( e.g. , @xcite , see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "recently significant progress has been made in the large water cherenkov detectors such as super - kamiokande @xcite and icecube @xcite , and also in the liquid scintillator detector as kamland @xcite .",
    "if a supernova occurs in our galactic center ( @xmath3 kpc ) , about @xmath4 @xmath5 events are estimated to be detectable by icecube ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "those successful neutrino detections are important not only to study the supernova physics but also to unveil the nature of neutrinos itself such as the neutrino oscillation parameters and the mass hierarchy ( e.g. , @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "ccsne are now about to start even another astronomy , _ gravitational - wave astronomy_. currently long - baseline laser interferometers such as ligo ( usa , e.g. , @xcite ) , virgo ( italy ) , geo600 ( germany ) , and tama300 ( japan , e.g. , @xcite ) are currently operational and preparing for the first observation ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent review ) , by which the prediction by einstein s theory of general relativity ( gr ) can be confirmed .",
    "these instruments are being updated to their _ advanced _ status , and may start taking data , possibly detecting gws for the first time , as soon as 2015 ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "in fact , _ advanced _ ligo / virgo , which is an upgrade of the initial ligo and vigro , are expected to be completed by 2015 and will increase the observable detection volume by a factor of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the large - scale cryogenic gravitational - wave telescope ( lcgt , @xcite ) in japan was funded in late 2010 , which is being built under the kamioka mine and is expected to take its first data in 2016 .",
    "at such a high level of precision , those gw detectors are sensitive to many different sources , including chirp , ring - down , and merger phases of black - hole and neutron star binaries ( e.g. , @xcite ) , neutron star normal mode oscillations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , rotating neutron star mountains ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and ccsn explosions ( e.g. , @xcite for recent reviews ) , on the final of which we focus in this article .    according to the einstein s theory of gr ( e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "no gws can be emitted if gravitational collapse of the supernova core proceeds perfectly spherically symmetric .",
    "to produce gws , the gravitational collapse should proceed aspherically and dynamically .",
    "observational evidence gathered over the last few decades has pointed towards ccsne indeed being generally aspherical ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the most unequivocal example is sn1987a . to explain the light - curve , a large amount of mixing of ni outward to the h - he interface and of h inward into the he - core was required ( e.g. , @xcite , and @xcite for a review ) .",
    "such mixing processes coming from the rayleigh - taylor instability at the interface with different compositions after shock passage have been examined extensively so far by 2d ( e.g. , @xcite ) and 3d simulations @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry of iron and nickel lines in sn1987a was proposed to be explained , if the explosion occurs in a jet - like @xcite or in a unipolar manner @xcite .",
    "more directly , the hst images of sn1987a are showing that the expanding envelope is elliptical with the long axis aligned with the rotation axis inferred from the ring ( @xcite , see however @xcite for a recent counter argument ) .",
    "the aspect ratio and position angle of the symmetry axis are consistent with those predicted earlier from the observations of speckle and linear polarization .",
    "what is more , the linear polarization became greater as time passed ( e.g. , @xcite ) , a fact which has been used to argue that the central engine of the explosion is responsible for the non - sphericity ( e.g. , @xcite ) . by performing a series of time - dependent , non - lte(local thermodynamic equilibrium ) , radiation - transport simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , @xcite recently pointed out that asymmetry in the ejecta can explain the increase in the continuum polarization observed at the nebular phases @xcite .",
    "dense knots , indications of ejecta clumpiness , and filaments seen in supernova remnants by hst in the visual @xcite and by rosat , chandra , and xmm - newton @xcite in x - rays also provide evidence that small- and large - scale inhomogeneities ( and perhaps even fragmentation ) are a common feature in supernova explosions .",
    "advancing ability of the hst has enabled the direct observation of the progenitors of nearby ccsne from pre - explosion images ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "although observational measurements of the progenitor masses are currently not many and still highly uncertain ( see @xcite for collective references therein ) , evidence has accumulated that sn type ii - plateau ( ii - p ) comes predominantly from stars in the range about of 8 - 16 @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "a generic explosion energy of the sn ii - p in the mass range is roughly on the order of @xmath7 erg @xcite , however a large diversity of the explosion signatures ( i.e. explosion energy and the synthesized ni mass ) have been so far observed from quite similar progenitors @xcite .",
    "for example , the inferred @xmath8 mass and the kinetic energies differ by a factor of five between sne 2005cs and 2003gd , both of them are among the _ golden events _ in which enough information was obtained to give an accurate estimate on a color or spectral type of the progenitor and the initial mass .",
    "more massive stars are expected to lose much of their mass and explode as hydrogen - stripped sne ( ib / c and iib ) . among them ,",
    "the type ic - bl sne , which are associated with long gamma - ray bursts @xcite , all show much broader lines than sne ic . due to the large kinetic energies of @xmath9 erg ,",
    "they have been referred to as `` hypernovae '' ( e.g. , @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "these events are likely to come from interacting binaries in which the primary exploding star has a mass lower than what is usually associated with evolution to the massive wr phase ( e.g. , @xcite , see however @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the two branches mentioned above , @xcite predicted yet another branch , in which the sne ii - p with higher progenitor mass result in fainter explosions . by connecting to candidate sn explosion mechanisms or to progenitor structures , it is indeed best if one could obtain a unified picture to understand the mentioned wide diversity which is not only dependent on the progenitor masses but also on the evolution scenarios ( a single vs. binary evolution ) .",
    "but , this is an area for future study firstly because it is too computationally expensive to perform a long - term simulation that follows multidimensional ( multi - d ) dynamics consistently from the onset of core - collapse , through explosion , up to the nebular phase , secondly because we are still inaccessible to multi - d stellar evolution models , in which multi - d modeling has been a major undertaking ( see @xcite for recent developments ) .    from a theoretical point of view , clarifying what makes the dynamics of the supernova engine deviate from spherical symmetry is essential in understanding the gw emission mechanism .",
    "here it is worth mentioning that gws are primary observables , which imprint a live information of the central engine , because they carry the information directly to us without being affected in propagating from the stellar center to the earth .",
    "on the other hand , sn neutrinos are exposed to a number of ( external ) environmental effects , including self - interaction that induces collective neutrino flavor oscillations predominantly in the vicinity of the neutrino sphere ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews of the rapidly growing research field and collective references therein ) and the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) effect @xcite both in the stellar envelope and in the earth ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "although the time profiles of neutrino signals can be potentially used like a tomography to monitor the envelope profile ( e.g. , @xcite for a recent review ) , sn neutrinos generally could provide a rather indirect information about the central engine compared to gws .",
    "the breaking of the sphericity in the supernova engine has been considered as the most important ingredient to understand the explosion mechanism , for which supernova theorists have been continuously keeping their efforts for the past @xmath0 40 years .",
    "currently multi - d simulations based on refined numerical models have shown several promising scenarios . among the candidates",
    "are the neutrino heating mechanism aided by convection and hydrodynamic instabilities of the supernova shock ( e.g. , @xcite for a review ) , the acoustic mechanism @xcite , or the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) mechanism ( e.g. , @xcite see references therein ) . to pin down the true answer among the candidate mechanisms , gw signatures albeit being a primary observable , will not be solely enough and a careful analysis including neutrinos and photons should be indispensable .",
    "the current neutrino detectors is ready to broadcast the alert to astronomers to let them know the arrival of neutrinos ( e.g. , supernova early warning systems ( snews ) @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to optical observations using largest 8 - 10 m telescopes such as vlt and subaru telescope ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the planned thirty - meter - telescope ( tmt ) with a refined spectropolarimetric technique is expected to detect more than 20 events of the sn polarization per year .",
    "this should provide valuable information to understand the sn asymmetry with increasing statistics .",
    "not only for understanding the origin of non - spherical ejecta morphology but more importantly for understanding the origin of heavy elements , it is of crucial importance to accurately determine nucleosynthesis in the sn ejecta , which naturally requires a multi - d numerical modeling ( see , @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "putting things together , the multidimensionality determines the explosion mechanism , in turn we may extract the information that traces the multidimensionality by the sn multimessengers , which would be only possible by a careful analysis on gws , neutrinos , and photons . in this review article , we hope to bring together various of our published and unpublished findings from our recent multi - d supernova simulations and the obtained predictions of the sn multimessengers so far ( for other high - energy astrophysical sources such as magnetars , gamma - ray bursts , and coalescing binaries , see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "before we go into details from the next sections , we first have to draw a caution that the current generation of simulation results that we report in this article should depend on the next generation calculations by which more sophistication can be made not only in determining the efficiency of neutrino - matter coupling ( the so - called neutrino transport calculation ) , but also in the treatment of general relativity .",
    "therefore we provide here only a snapshot of the moving ( long - run ) documentary film whose headline we ( boldly ) chose to entitle as `` multimessengers from ccsne to bridge theory and observation '' .    among the mentioned candidate mechanisms",
    ", we focus on the neutrino - heating mechanism in section [ sec2 ] and the mhd mechanism in section [ sec3 ] , respectively . in each section",
    ", we first briefly summarize the properties of the explosion dynamics and then move on to discuss possible properties of the sn multimessengers paying particular attention to their detectability",
    ". it may be best if we can cover these sn messengers once for all in this article , but unfortunately not .",
    "what we have studied so far is limited to gws and explosive nucleosynthesis in the neutrino - heating mechanism , and to gws and neutrino signals in the mhd mechanism . to compensate the uncovered fields ,",
    "the related references will be given .",
    "although a number of excellent reviews already exist on various topics in this article , this one might go beyond such reviews by its new perspectives on the multimessenger astronomy .",
    "ccsn simulations have been counted as one of the most challenging subjects in computational astrophysics .",
    "the four fundamental forces of nature are all at play ; the collapsing iron core bounces due to strong interactions ; weak interactions determine the energy and lepton number loss in the core via the transport of neutrinos ; electromagnetic interactions determine the properties of the stellar gas ; gr plays an important role due to the compactness of the proto - neutron star and also due to high velocities of the collapsing material outside .",
    "naturally , such physical richness ranging from a microphysical scale ( i.e. femto - meter scale ) of strong / weak interactions to a macrophysical scale of stellar explosions has long attracted the interest of researchers , necessitating a world - wide , multi - disciplinary collaboration to clarify the theory of massive stellar core - collapse and the formation mechanisms of compact objects .",
    "ever since the first numerical simulation of such events @xcite , the neutrino - heating mechanism @xcite , in which a stalled bounce shock could be revived via neutrino absorption on a timescale of several hundred milliseconds after bounce , has been the working hypothesis of supernova theorists for these @xmath0 45 years . however ,",
    "the simplest , spherically - symmetric ( 1d ) form of this mechanism fails to blow up canonical massive stars @xcite",
    ". pushed by mounting observations of the blast morphology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) mentioned above , it is now almost certain that the breaking of the spherical symmetry is the key to solve the supernova problem . so far a number of multi - d hydrodynamic simulations have been reported , which _ demonstrated _ that hydrodynamic motions associated with convective overturn ( e.g. , @xcite ) as well as the standing - accretion - shock - instability ( sasi , e.g. , @xcite see references therein ) can help the onset of the neutrino - driven explosion .    to test the neutrino heating mechanism in the multi - d context",
    ", it is of crucial importance to solve accurately the neutrino - matter coupling in spatially non - uniform hydrodynamic environments . for the purpose ,",
    "one ultimately needs to solve the six - dimensional ( 6d ) neutrino radiation transport problem ( three in space , three in the momentum space of neutrinos ) , which is a main reason why the supernova simulations stand out from other astrophysical simulations due to their complexity . in the final sentence of the last paragraph , we wrote `` demonstrated '' because the neutrino heating was given by hand as an input parameter in most of the simulations cited above ( see , however @xcite ) .",
    "the neutrino heating proceeds dominantly via the charged current interactions ( @xmath10 ) in the gain region . the neutrino heating rate in the gain region can be roughly expressed as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the neutrino luminosity emitted from the surface of neutrino sphere and it determines the amplitude of the neutrino heating as well as cooling , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the distance from the stellar center and the flux factor near at the neutrino sphere , @xmath15 in the free - streaming limit ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "] , respectively ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , @xmath12 is treated as an input parameter in the so - called ` light - bulb' approach ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is one of the most prevailing approximations in recent 3d simulations @xcite because it is handy to study multi - d effects on the neutrino heating mechanism ( albeit on the qualitative grounds ) . to go beyond the light - bulb scheme",
    ", @xmath12 should be determined in a self - consistent manner . for the purpose",
    ", one needs to tackle with neutrino transport problem , only by which energy as well as angle dependence of the neutrino distribution function can be determined without any assumptions . since the focus of this review is on the sn multi - messengers , a detailed discussion of various approximations and numerical techniques taken in the recent radiation - hydrodynamic sn simulations can not be provided .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      as it is well known , there are three typical evolutionary stages observed in our local simulations .",
    "they are ( i ) exponential growth stage , ( ii ) transition stage , and ( iii ) nonlinear turbulent stage @xcite . each stage",
    "is denoted by white , dark gray and light gray shaded regions in figure [ f1_mri ] .    in the stage ( i )",
    ", the channel structure of the magnetic field exponentially evolves and inversely cascades to the larger spatial scale with small structures merging as the magnetic field is amplified .",
    "this is because the channel modes of the mri are a exact solution for the nonlinear mhd equations @xcite .",
    "the temporal evolution of channel structures for the toroidal magnetic field and their inversely cascading nature are shown in panels ( a ) and ( b ) of figure [ f2_mri ] . then in the stage  ( ii ) , the channel structure of the magnetic field is disrupted via the parasitic instability and magnetic reconnection at the transition stage @xcite .",
    "the channel disruption induces a drastic phase - shift from the coherent structure to the turbulent tangled structure of the field as is illustrated by panel ( c ) of figure [ f2_mri ] .",
    "the magnetic energy stored in the amplified magnetic field is then converted to the thermal energy of the system .",
    "finally in the stage ( iii ) , the nonlinear stage emerges after the channel structures are disrupted to be a turbulence state driven by the mri ( see panel ( d ) in figure [ f2_mri ] ) .",
    "figure  [ f1_mri]a shows that , at this stage , the turbulent maxwell stress ( @xmath22 ) dominates over the reynolds stress ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "therefore the turbulent maxwell stress is the main player to convert the free energy stored in the differential rotation into the thermal energy of the system .",
    "figure [ f1_mri]b shows the power spectra of the magnetic energy in the nonlinear turbulent stage .",
    "the logarithmic slope of the spectrum roughly coincides with @xmath24 in the regime @xmath25 while it steepens at higher wave - numbers where numerical effects become important ( like @xmath26 ) .",
    "this indicates that the turbulent state in the mri can be represented by the kolmogorov spectrum for a homogeneous , incompressible turbulence that scales as @xmath27 .",
    "these features would be consistent with the 3d properties of the mri - driven turbulence @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out in the previous axisymmetric local shearing box simulation that the channel structures do neither disrupt nor transit to the turbulent state without a relatively strong resistive effect @xcite .",
    "we however adopted the simulation box with a large aspect ratio ( @xmath28 ) and quasi - isothermal equation of state ( @xmath29 ) , both of which could facilitate to disrupt the channel structures @xcite as in 3d simulations .",
    "figure [ f3_mri ] shows the time- and volume - averaged maxwell ( green squares ) and reynolds stresses ( orange diamonds , panel ( a ) ) , and magnetic energy ( blue circles , panel ( b ) ) in the turbulent stage as a function of the initial magnetic energy .",
    "it is shown that the maxwell stress depends on the initial magnetic flux and it provides the following scaling relation , @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "this suggests that the magnetic flux initially penetrating the system controls the nonlinear transport properties of the mri - driven turbulence .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the previous results in the accretion disk @xcite while the power - law index obtained here is slightly larger . note that the magnetic energy at the nonlinear turbulent stage has a linear dependence on the initial magnetic flux ( because @xmath32 ( figure [ f3_mri](b ) ) ) .",
    "this is also qualitatively consistent with hawley et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . in this way , we investigated parameter dependence of the rotational shear ( @xmath33 parameter ) as well as the initial pressure ( @xmath34 ) on the saturated value of the maxwell stress and deduced a scaling relation that yields @xmath35^{1/4}\\omega^{1/2}$ ] . here",
    "the shear parameter represents the degree of differential rotation as @xmath36 with @xmath13 being the radial coordinate .    using the scaling relation obtained in our local simulations ,",
    "the heating rate maintained by the mri turbulence can be estimated as , @xmath37\\ q\\omega \\nonumber \\\\                     & & \\simeq   10^{30}{\\rm erg\\ cm^{-3}}\\ { \\rm sec}^{-1 } \\times \\\\                     & & f_{30}\\ q_{{\\rm pb } , 1}\\ ; s_{{\\rm pb},1}^{1/4}\\left ( \\frac{b_{\\rm pb}}{10b_0}\\right)^2                     \\left ( \\frac{p_{\\rm pb}}{100p_0 } \\right)^{1/4 }                     \\left(\\frac{\\omega_{\\rm pb}}{\\omega_0 } \\right)^{3/2 } \\ ; , \\nonumber \\label{f}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 represents a typical amplification factor of the stress normalized by @xmath39 ( e.g. , figure [ f3_mri ] ) , @xmath40 is the shear rate normalized by unity and @xmath41 is the ratio of the vorticity to the shear normalized by unity .",
    "since we are interested in the growth of the mri in the postbounce phase , the original magnetic flux , gas pressure angular velocity , and the shear rate @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are replaced by @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 with some amplification factors .",
    "a typical volume in which the mri - driven turbulence is active , may be estimated as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 cm is typical radius of the pns normalized by @xmath52 cm , and @xmath53 cm is the typical radial width of the mri - active layer normalized by @xmath54 cm .",
    "then the energy releasing rate @xmath55 becomes , @xmath56 typical timescales of neutrino - driven explosions observed in recent supernova simulations are @xmath57 ms after bounce ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "so the energy deposition could be as high as @xmath58 if the core rotates rather rapidly as taken in the above estimation .",
    "if this is the case , the turbulent heating due to the mri is expected to play an important role for assisting the neutrino - driven explosion .",
    "it should be noted that nonaxisymmetric modes of the parasitic instability could disrupt the channel structures more effectively than in 2d @xcite . to obtain more accurate estimate of the amplification factor of @xmath59 ( equation ( [ f ] ) ) , 3d simulations",
    "are unquestionably required , which we are currently undertaking .      as already mentioned in section",
    "[ sec2.1 ] , rapid rotation , necessary for producing strong bounce gw signals , is likely to obtain @xmath0 1% of massive star population ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this can be really the case , albeit minor , for progenitors of rapidly rotating metal - poor stars , which experience the so - called chemically homogeneous evolution @xcite .",
    "in such a case , the mhd mechanism could work to produce energetic explosions , which are receiving great attention recently as a possible relevance to magnetars and collapsars ( e.g. , @xcite , see @xcite for collective references ) , which are presumably linked to the formation of long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) ( e.g. , @xcite for review ) .    among the previous studies focusing on the bounce signals ( e.g. , references in section [ sec2.1 ] )",
    ", only a small portion of papers has been spent on determining the gw signals in the mhd mechanism @xcite .",

    "since neutrino oscillations take place only when there is a difference in the neutrino fluxes among different species ( see section 3 @xcite for more details on the neutrino oscillations ) , the oscillation effects in the neutronization epoch would be strongest . unfortunately , however , they are very hard to measure because the currently - running detectors are primarily sensitive to @xmath5 signals that are produced by the inverse beta process @xmath89 . it should be noted that the detection the @xmath88 bursts is important for studying not only neutrino oscillations but also for determining the direction and distance to the source @xcite . in a megaton - class cherenkov detector in which gadolinium is added to catch neutrons @xcite , and large liquid - argon detectors ( like icarus and glacier cited above )",

    "regardless of the inherent non - linearity and the presence of multi - angle effects , the final outcome for the emergent neutrino flux seems to be converging after a series of extensive study over the past years at least for the 1d models .",

    "the next sn event could provide an opportunity to study also a nontrivial property of neutrinos , such as the magnetic dipole moments .",
    "the resonant spin - flavor conversion has been also studied both analytically ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) and numerically ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which can transform some of the prompt @xmath99 burst into @xmath5 in highly magnetized supernova envelopes , leading to a huge @xmath5 burst . the mentioned important ingredients related to the flavor conversions due to the msw effects , collective effects , and the electromagnetic effects in the supernova environment have been studied often one by one in each study without putting all the effects together , possibly in order to highlight the new ingredient . in this sense , all the studies mentioned above should be regarded as complimentary towards the precise predictions of sn neutrinos .    here it should be mentioned that most of those rich phenomenology of sn neutrinos have been based on 1d spherically symmetric simulations ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . apart from a simple parametrization to mimic anisotropy and stochasticity of the shock ( e.g. , @xcite ) , there have been not so many studies focusing how global asymmetry of the explosion dynamics obtained in recent supernova simulations ( e.g. , section [ sec2 ] and [ sec3 ] ) would affect the neutrino oscillations ( see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "this is mainly due to the lack of multi - d supernova models , which are very computationally expensive to continue the simulations till the shock waves propagate outward until they affect neutrino transformations .",
    "it is only recently that several studies along this line have been reported @xcite , in which the collective or msw effects are rendered to be treated in an approximate manner . by analyzing the 2d results of a 15 @xmath1 model by @xcite who included one of the best available neutrino transfer approximations ( e.g. , table 1 ) , @xcite pointed out that fast time variations caused by convection and sasi lead to significant modulations around a few hundred hz , which can be visible in icecube or future megaton - class detectors for the galactic sn source .",
    "based on the 2d results of 20 @xmath1 models by @xcite who reported the first 2d multi - angle transport simulations , @xcite also obtained the similar results . from their rapidly rotating model",
    ", they also pointed out that a rapid rotation of precollapse sn cores imprints strong asymmetries in the neutrino flux @xcite as well as in its light curves @xcite .    in the following",
    ", we briefly summarize our findings @xcite in which we studied exploratory the neutrino oscillations in the context of the mhd mechanism . as mentioned in section [ sec3 ]",
    ", it is recently possible for special relativistic simulations to follow the dynamics of mhd explosions continuously , starting from the onset of gravitational collapse , through core - bounce , the magnetic shock - revival , till the shock - propagation to the stellar surface .",
    "based on our models @xcite , we calculated numerically the neutrino flavor conversion in the highly non - spherical envelope through the msw effect .",
    "the neutrino transport was simply treated by a leakage scheme ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the emergent neutrino spectra was assumed to take a fermi - dirac type distribution function and the neutrino temperature was estimated to take the average matter temperature on the neutrino sphere . as explained section 3.0.2 , the density profile along the polar and equatorial direction is very different due to the strong explosion anisotropy inherent to the mhd explosions . in the following , we pay attention to the anisotropic shock effect on the msw effect . as will be discussed",
    ", we could observe a sharp dip in the neutrino event only seen from a polar direction , albeit depending on the mass hierarchy and the the mixing angle of @xmath100 .",
    "an advantage of the mhd models is that the shock revival can occur much faster after bounce compared to the other proposed mechanism .",
    "therefore the neutrino luminosity could remain higher than those in the other mechanisms , which could potentially enhance the detectability due to the early shock arrival to the resonance region . for simplicity",
    ", the effects of neutrino self - interactions are treated very phenomenologically and the resonant spin - flavor is not considered . even though far from comprehensive in this respect , we presented the first discussion how the magneto - driven explosion anisotropy has impacts on the emergent neutrino spectra and the resulting event number observed by the sk for a future galactic supernova ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one prominent feature of the mhd models is a high degree of the explosion asphericity .",
    "figure [ f1_nu ] shows several snapshots featuring typical hydrodynamics of the model , from near core - bounce ( 0.8 s , left ) , during the shock - propagation ( 2.0 s , middle ) , till near the shock break - out from the star ( 4.3 s , right ) , in which time is measured from the epoch of core bounce .",
    "it can be seen that the strong shock propagates outwards with time along the rotational axis . on the other hand ,",
    "the density profile hardly changes in the equatorial direction , which is a generic feature of the mhd explosions .",
    "as well known , the flavor conversion through the pure - matter msw effect occurs in the resonance layer , where the density is @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the mass squared difference , @xmath103 is the neutrino energy , @xmath104 is the number of electrons per baryon , and @xmath105 is the mixing angle . since the inner supernova core is too dense to allow msw resonance conversion , we focus on two resonance points in the outer supernova envelope .",
    "one that occurs at higher density is called the h - resonance , and the other , which occurs at lower density , is called the l - resonance . @xmath106 and",
    "@xmath107 correspond to @xmath108 and @xmath100 at the h - resonance and to @xmath109 and @xmath110 at the l - resonance .",
    "figure [ f2_nu ] are evolutions of the density profiles in the polar direction every 0.4 s as a function of radius . above and below horizontal lines",
    "show approximately density of the resonance for different neutrino energies which are 5 and 60 mev , respectively . blue lines ( left panel ) show the range of the density of the h - resonance , and sky - blue lines ( right panel ) show that of the l - resonance . along the polar axis",
    ", the shock wave reaches to the h - resonance , @xmath111)g/@xmath112 at @xmath113 s , and the l - resonance , @xmath114g/@xmath112 at @xmath115 s. it should be noted that those timescales are very early in comparison with the ones predicted in the neutrino - driven explosion models , typically @xmath116 5 s and @xmath0 15 s for the h- and l- resonances , respectively ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this arises from the fact that the mhd explosion is triggered promptly after core bounce , which is in sharp contrast to the neutrino - driven _ delayed _ explosion models ( @xcite ) .",
    "the progenitor of the mhd models , possibly linked to long - duration gamma - ray bursts , is more compact due to a chemically homogeneous evolution @xcite , which is also the reason for the early shock - arrival to the resonance regions .",
    "figure [ f3_nu ] is the energy spectra of @xmath5 for ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) in the case of inverted mass hierarchy .",
    "the solid lines ( red lines ) and the dotted lines ( blue lines ) are the spectra of the polar direction and the equatorial direction , respectively . at the panel ( a ) , an enhancement of the low - energy side of the polar direction is seen , which is as a result of the supernova shock reaching to the h - resonance region .",
    "the survival probability of @xmath5 can remain non - zero when the steep decline of the density at the shock front changes the resonance into non - adiabatic ( see @xcite for more details ) . as the shock propagates from the high density region to low energy region , the shock effect transits from low - energy side to high - energy side in spectra , because the density at the resonance point , @xmath117 , is proportional to @xmath118 .",
    "in fact , the energy spectrum of the polar direction becomes softer in the high - energy side than for the equatorial direction as shown in figure [ f3_nu ] ( b ) .",
    "figure [ f4_nu ] shows the time evolution of the event number in sk , where the solid line ( red line ) and the dotted line ( blue line ) are for the polar and the equatorial direction , respectively . the shock effect is clearly seen .",
    "the event number of the polar direction shows a steep decrease , marking the shock passage to the h - resonance layer .",
    "the change of the event number by the shock passage is about 36% of the event number without the shock .",
    "since the expected events are @xmath119 at the sudden decrease ( figure [ f4_nu ] ) , it seems to be quite possible to identify such a feature by the sk class detectors .",
    "such a large number imprinting the shock effect , possibly up to two - orders - of magnitudes larger than the ones predicted in the neutrino - driven explosions ( e.g. , fig 11 in @xcite ) , is thanks to the mentioned early shock - arrival to the resonance layer , peculiar for the mhd explosions .",

    "typically later than @xmath87 ms after bounce , the bounce shock turns to a standing accretion shock , and the activities of convective overturns and sasi become vigorous with time behind the standing shock . since anisotropies of the neutrino flux and matter motions in the postbounce phase are governed by the non - linear hydrodynamics , gws emitted in this epoch also change stochastically with time ( indicated by `` stochastic '' in the table , e.g. , section [ sec3.1 ] for more details ) . for detecting these signals for a galactic ccsn event with a good signal - to - noise ratio ,",
    "we need next generation detectors such as the advanced ligo , lcgt , and the fabry - perot(fp)-type decigo .",
    "neutrino signals at the non - linear epoch also change stochastically with time , which is expected to be detected by currently running detector such as by icecube and sk @xcite for the galactic event .",
    "it should be also mentioned that detailed neutrino transport including the most up - to - date interaction rates should be accurately implemented in the multi - d simulations to make a reliable prediction of the neutrino signals ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "when material behind the stalled shock successfully absorbs enough neutrino energy to be gravitationally unbound from the iron core , the @xmath17p process is expected to successfully explain some light proton - rich nuclei in the neutrino - driven wind phase @xcite . when the revived supernova shock ( successfully ) attains the kinetic energy as energetic as @xmath7 erg , explosive nucleosynthesis that proceeds in the sasi - aided low - mode explosions",
    "is expected to partly explain the solar abundance yields as well as the observed non - uniform morphology of the synthesized elements ( e.g. , section [ exp ] ) .",
    "one important notice here is that explosion energies obtained in the state - of - the - art multi - d simulations are typically underpowered by one or two orders - of - magnitudes to explain the canonical supernova kinetic energy ( @xmath121 erg , e.g. , table 1 ) .",

    "if such simulations would be executable , the mhd outflows will be produced even for more weakly magnetized cores than currently predicted .",

    "the pole to equator anisotropy of the shock propagation in the mhd explosions affect the neutrino signals through the msw effects .",
    "the anisotropic shock passage to the h - resonance regions leads to a sudden decrease in the sk events ( @xmath119 events for a galactic source ) , which is quite possible to identify by the sk - class detectors ( indicated by `` anisotropy in sk events '' in table 2 ) .",
    "since the mhd mechanism has such distinct signatures , a planned joint analysis of neutrino and gw data @xcite would be potentially very powerful to tell the mhd mechanism from the other candidate mechanisms . if the resonant spin - flavor conversion ( indicated as rsf in table 2 ) occurs in the highly magnetized core , the neutronization burst of @xmath88 converts to that of @xmath5 , which is thus expected to be a probe into the magnetic moment of neutrinos ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "finally the mhd explosions are considered to be a possible @xmath13-process cite @xcite - process cites . ] .",
    "this is because the mass ejection from the iron core occurs in much shorter timescales compared to the delayed neutrino - heating mechanism , so that the ejecta can stay neutron rich before it becomes proton - rich via neutrino capture reactions .",
    "most of these possibilities regarding the mhd mechanism have been proposed so far in simulations with a crude treatment of neutrino transport , which is now rather easily re - examined by the state - of - the - art multi - d simulations ( if the code is mhd ) .    finally , what is about the story if the mhd mechanism fails ? ( indicated by \" path to hypernovae in table 2 ) .",
    "the rapidly rotating pns collapses into a bh , probably leading to the formation of accretion disk around the bh .",
    "neutrinos emitted from the accretion disk heat matter in the polar funnel region to launch outflows or strong magnetic fields in the cores of the order of @xmath128 g also play an active role both in driving the magneto - driven jets and in extracting a significant amount of energy from the bh ( e.g. , @xcite and see references therein ) .",
    "this picture , often referred as collapsar ( e.g. , @xcite ) , has been the working hypothesis as a central engine of long - duration grbs for these 10 years ( see references in @xcite for other candidate mechanism including magnetar models ) .",
    "however it is still controversial whether the generation of the relativistic outflows predominantly proceeds via the neutrino - heating mechanism or the mhd mechanism .",
    "in contrast to a number of findings illustrated in table 2 , much little things are known about the bh - forming supernovae and also about the collapsar . this is mainly because the requirement for making a _ realistic _",
    "numerical modeling is very computationally expensive , which ( at least ) necessitates the multi - d mhd simulations not only with gr for handling the bh formation ( thus full gr ) , but also with the multi - angle neutrino transfer for treating highly anisotropic neutrino radiation from the accretion disk . to get a unified picture of massive stellar death ,",
    "we need to draw a schematic picture ( like table 2 ) also in the case of the bh - forming supernovae .",
    "we anticipate that our long - lasting focus ( and experience ) on the explosion dynamics of canonical ccsne will be readily applicable to clarifying the origin of the gigantic explosion energy of hypernovae and also unraveling ( ultimately ) the central engine of long - duration grbs .",
    "this should provide yet another grand challenge in computational astrophysics in the next decades .",
    "as repeatedly mentioned so far , all the numerical results in this article should be tested by the next - generation calculations by which more sophistication is made not only in the treatment of multi - d radiation transport ( both of neutrino and photon ) , but also in multi - d hydrodynamics including stellar rotation and magnetic fields in full gr . from an optimistic point of view , our understanding on every issue raised in this article can progress in a step - by - step manner at the same pace as our available computational resources will be growing bigger and bigger from now on . since 2009",
    ", several neutrino detectors form the supernova early warning systems ( snews ) to broadcast the alert to astronomers to let them know the arrival of neutrinos @xcite .",
    "currently , super - kamiokande , lvd , borexino , and icecube contributes to the snews , with a number of other neutrino and gw detectors planning to join in the near future .",
    "this is a very encouraging news towards the high - precision multi - messenger astronomy .",
    "the interplay between the detailed numerical modeling , the advancing supercomputing resources , and the multi - messenger astronomy , will remain a central issue for advancing our understanding of the theory of massive stellar core - collapse for the future .",
    "a documentary film recording our endeavours to make practicable the `` multimessenger astronomy of ccsne '' seems not to show `` _ fin _ '' immediately and is becoming even longer as far as the three components evolve with time . to raise the edifice",
    ", it is becoming increasingly important to bring forward a world - wide , multi - disciplinary collaboration among different research groups .",
    "we believe that such an approach would provide the shortest cut to get a deeper understanding of a number of unsettled and exciting issues that we were only able to touch in this article .                      ,",
