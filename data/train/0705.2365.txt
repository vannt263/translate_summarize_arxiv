    "despite a widespread conviction , the concept of photon in vacuo does not pertain exclusively to quantum physics .",
    "classical general relativity has its say on the subject , as it was beautifully shown long ago by kermack et al .",
    "@xcite and by synge @xcite . by availing of hamiltonian methods , and of the reduction to the vacuum case of the geometrical optics of dielectrics operated by gordon @xcite and by pham mau quan @xcite ,",
    "the problem of the definition of the photon in dielectrics is considered anew in the present paper .",
    "the abstract formulation @xcite of hamilton s theory of rays and waves is first recalled ( section 2 ) .",
    "the metric is then introduced , and the particular hamiltonians that apply to the case of the vacuum ( section 3 ) , and of isotropic , nondispersive dielectrics ( section 4 ) are considered .",
    "synge s derivation of the proportionality between energy and frequency for the photon in the vacuum of general relativity is then displayed ( section 5 ) .",
    "his argument , when applied to the case of dielectrics , leads to a twofold possibility : one must choose either a timelike photon ( section 6 ) , for which however the proportionality between energy and frequency breaks down in nonhomogeneous dielectrics , or a spacelike photon ( section 7 ) for which the proportionality is always ensured .",
    "the latter option however requires , at variance with what occurs in mechanics , that an entity endowed with a spacelike momentum - energy vector be associated to a timelike ray .",
    "the existence of this twofold possibility is akin to the ancient , unsolved dilemma in the electromagnetism of continua , whether the energy tensor of the electromagnetic field in dielectrics should be given either the expression proposed by abraham @xcite or the one formulated by minkowski @xcite .",
    "like maxwell s equations , also the equations of hamilton s theory of rays and waves @xcite lie very deep in the conceptual structure of physics .",
    "in fact , as it occurs with maxwell s equations @xcite , these equations can be written without availing of either an affine or a metric connection : a bare eight - dimensional manifold suffices , equipped only with coordinates @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in this manifold",
    "a 7-surface @xmath2 is assumed to exist , whose equation is @xmath3 by following synge s account , we consider a curve @xmath4 joining the points @xmath5 and @xmath6 on @xmath2 , and the integral @xmath7 we propose ourselves to find the extremals of this integral with the varied curve always lying on @xmath2 . to this end",
    "a parameter @xmath8 is introduced , whose values at @xmath5 and at @xmath6 are fixed for all the curves , and we get rid of the side condition ( [ 2.1 ] ) by considering the variation of the integral @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a lagrange multiplier .",
    "a generic variation of @xmath11 reads @xmath12^a_b\\\\\\nonumber + \\int_a^b\\left(\\delta y_i\\dd x^i-\\delta x^i\\dd y_i -h\\delta\\lambda\\dd u -\\lambda\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x^i}\\delta x^i \\dd u -\\lambda\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y_i}\\delta y_i \\dd u\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is asked that @xmath13 under arbitrary variations of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , provided that @xmath14 vanish at @xmath5 and at @xmath6 .",
    "one finds that the extremals must obey the equations @xmath17 since the variation does not determine @xmath10 , one can choose the parameter @xmath8 in order to write the equations of the extremals in the hamiltonian form @xmath18 these equations can be given another interpretation , in terms of a four - dimensional manifold whose coordinates are @xmath0 .",
    "in the new interpretation , equation ( [ 2.1 ] ) no longer refers to a 7-surface @xmath2 , but to a set of 3-spaces , each one associated to a point @xmath0 .",
    "we want that the theory be invariant under arbitrary transformations of the @xmath19-coordinates , hence we must think of the @xmath1 as a covariant four - vector defined on the manifold .",
    "considered in the original eight - dimensional space , an extremal is a curve on @xmath2 . in the four - dimensional manifold whose coordinates are @xmath0 , it appears as a curve @xmath20 with an associated vector field @xmath21 .",
    "let us consider from the four - dimensional standpoint the integral ( [ 2.2 ] ) along an extremal joining the points @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and call it @xmath24 .",
    "it is nothing but hamilton s characteristic function .",
    "if the points @xmath5 and @xmath6 are varied and the integral for the new extremal is compared to the integral for the previous one , since the integral in the second row of ( [ 2.4 ] ) vanishes for the extremals , one finds @xmath25^b_a.\\ ] ] provided that @xmath26 can be chosen arbitrarily , it must be @xmath27 inserting the first of ( [ 2.8 ] ) in ( [ 2.1 ] ) produces the hamilton - jacobi equation @xmath28 if the vector field @xmath1 defined by the extremals is such that the circulation @xmath29 for an arbitrary closed curve @xmath30 lying within some ( two , three or four dimensional ) domain @xmath31 , the extremals form what synge calls a coherent system and are named rays . for a coherent system ,",
    "the integral @xmath32 between a fixed point @xmath5 and a variable point @xmath6 does not depend on the path of integration .",
    "the subspace of @xmath31 that is found when @xmath6 varies but @xmath33 maintains a constant value @xmath34 is called a wave ; by varying the parameter @xmath34 we get a set of waves ; changing the starting point @xmath5 does not change the set ; it merely changes its parametrisation .",
    "for associating the quantities of the theory with the quantities of experience we need a metric .",
    "we assume that @xmath35 is the usual pseudo - riemannian metric of general relativity , that can be locally reduced through a suitable transformation to the minkowski form @xmath36",
    ". then we can introduce the timelike world - line of an observer endowed with four - velocity @xmath37 and define the frequency of the wave with respect to that observer : @xmath38 we can also consider whether @xmath39 is spacelike , timelike or null . in the first case @xmath40 can vanish locally , while this is impossible in the second case .",
    "one can also show @xcite that in the first case the phase velocity of the wave is inferior to the fundamental velocity introduced by the metric , while the converse is true in the second case . in the third case",
    "the wave propagates just with the fundamental velocity .",
    "such a null wave obeys the hamilton - jacobi equation @xmath41 since in this case the first of hamilton s equations ( [ 2.6 ] ) reads @xmath42 the ray velocity @xmath43 is null : @xmath44 the second of hamilton s equations reads now @xmath45 by eliminating @xmath39 in ( [ 3.5 ] ) with the use of ( [ 3.3 ] ) one finds that @xmath46 the extremals for the hamiltonian ( [ 3.2 ] ) are null geodesics , with the parameter @xmath8 of the extremal taking the role of special parameter for the geodesic .    for a coherent system one has @xmath47 when @xmath14 is a displacement along the wave .",
    "due to ( [ 3.3 ] ) one obtains @xmath48 since , again due to ( [ 3.3 ] ) @xmath49 one finds that not only the null ray is orthogonal to the null surface , but it lies in it too .",
    "the fact that a certain curve lies in a certain surface is however an occurrence that can be ascertained without a metric ; we shall remind of this property in the following , when dealing with photons in dielectrics .",
    "we define @xcite the electric displacement and the magnetic field by the antisymmetric , contravariant tensor density @xmath50 , while the electric field and the magnetic induction are given by the skew , covariant tensor @xmath51 .",
    "we define also the four - vectors : @xmath52 where @xmath37 is the four - velocity of the medium .",
    "if the latter is isotropic in its rest frame , its linear constitutive equation reads @xcite @xmath53 gordon @xcite noticed that ( [ 4.2 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath54 \\left[g^{ks}-(\\epsilon\\mu-1)u^{k}u^{s}\\right]f_{rs}.\\ ] ] therefore he introduced the `` effective metric tensor '' @xmath55 and rewrote the constitutive equation ( [ 4.2 ] ) as @xmath56 where @xmath57 . since after some simple algebra one finds @xcite that @xmath58 where @xmath59 , equation ( [ 4.3 ] ) can be eventually rewritten as @xmath60 therefore , apart from the factor @xmath61 , the constitutive equation in a nondispersive , isotropic dielectric medium is rendered by the effective metric @xmath62 exactly in the way the constitutive equation for vacuum is rendered by the pseudo - riemannian metric @xmath35 .",
    "if the medium is also homogeneous in its rest frame , the factor @xmath61 is constant , and the analogy with the vacuum case is complete",
    ". then one can reduce to the vacuum the problem of the choice of the lagrangian for the electromagnetic field in nondispersive , homogeneous , isotropic dielectrics . as a consequence , in such dielectrics the definition of the energy tensor of the electromagnetic field",
    "is uniquely given by gordon s procedure @xcite , and in this way the general relativistic extension of abraham s form @xcite is retrieved . in his seminal paper gordon , after finding the expression of the wave equation for tensorial fields in a pseudo - riemannian space , dealt with the limit of geometrical optics in the footsteps of hadamard @xcite and proved that the propagation of light in a dielectric that is isotropic and homogeneous in its local rest frame must obey , besides an equation that links the amplitude @xmath5 and the phase @xmath63 , the equation @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the effective metric ( [ 4.4 ] ) .",
    "to this equation gordon applied the hamiltonian method of section 3 to prove , inter alia , that `` the rays in moving bodies are represented through null geodesics of the manifold with the line element @xmath66 '' .",
    "gordon s proof applies to homogeneous dielectrics . in 1957 , by studying the characteristics of the maxwell - einstein equations @xcite , pham mau quan extended the validity of ( [ 4.8 ] ) to a nonhomogeneous medium .",
    "in two remarkable papers @xcite kermack et al . and synge have shown that the concept of photon in vacuo is by no means an exclusive outcome of quantum theory , but is deeply rooted in classical general relativity .",
    "we have already availed @xcite of synge s proof of the proportionality of energy and frequency for an entity endowed with both the behaviour of a null wave and of a null particle , exchanged between two atoms in arbitrary states of motion in a gravitational field .",
    "we have rather reproducing it here , since it is necessary for the discussion of photons in dielectrics from the hamiltonian viewpoint .",
    "atoms are dealt with as pointlike entities . in figure 1",
    "are shown the world - lines of an emitting and of an absorbing atom , joined by a null line @xmath67 .",
    "we attribute to the photon the hamiltonian ( [ 3.2 ] ) ; viewed as a point particle , its equations of motion are ( [ 3.6 ] ) and ( [ 3.4 ] ) .",
    "we endow this point particle with a momentum - energy vector @xmath68 that is tangent to the photon s world - line and is parallelly propagated along it : @xmath69 where @xmath70 , assumed to be positive , happens to be a constant thanks to ( [ 3.6 ] ) .",
    "since it travels with the fundamental velocity , the photon must have zero proper mass , hence : @xmath71 an atom is instead pictured as a timelike point particle endowed with the momentum - energy vector @xmath72 @xmath73 is the atom s rest mass or rest energy , while @xmath37 is its four - velocity .",
    "the change of the momentum - energy vector of the atom due to absorption of a photon is supposedly ruled by the conservation law : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the rest mass , and @xmath76 is the four - velocity of the atom after the absorption of the photon . by rewriting the conservation law in covariant form and by multiplying the two forms term by term one finds @xmath77 _ i.e. _ @xmath78 since for optical processes @xmath79 synge defines the energy @xmath80 of a photon with momentum - energy vector @xmath68 relative to an atom endowed with four - velocity @xmath37 as @xmath81 this scalar quantity is numerically equal to the fourth component of @xmath68 in a locally minkowskian coordinate system where the atom is at rest .",
    "the special parameter @xmath8 along the null geodesics joining the world - lines of the absorbing and of the emitting atoms can be given a single starting value and a single terminal value on these lines , since the geodesic equation is invariant under the linear transformation @xmath82 , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are constants .",
    "under this transformation the hamilton equations ( [ 3.3 ] ) and ( [ 3.5 ] ) are preserved too , provided that the @xmath1 undergo the corresponding transformation .",
    "the latter does not affect the structure of the waves , but only their parametrisation .",
    "let @xmath34 be the parameter introduced at the end of section 2 , associated to the waves after this reparametrisation has occurred .",
    "we can write @xmath85 we have also @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the christoffel connection built with @xmath35 . since @xmath88 , the right hand side of ( [ 5.8 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath89 hence one finds @xmath90 and , with reference to figure 1 : @xmath91 let @xmath92 , @xmath37 be the four - velocities of the atoms at @xmath93 and at @xmath5 respectively .",
    "if @xmath94 is the infinitesimal increment of the parameter @xmath34 when going from the null surface joining @xmath93 and @xmath5 to a neighbouring one , we can write : @xmath95 hence from ( [ 5.12 ] ) we get @xmath96 and the definition ( [ 5.7 ] ) of the energy of a photon absorbed ( or emitted ) by an atom allows rewriting the last equation as @xmath97 from the wave model of the photon implicit in hamilton s formulation in a coherent system one gathers that , if @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the intervals during which the emission and the absorption of the wavelike photon takes place respectively at the atoms @xmath93 and @xmath5 , it must be : @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath40 are the scalar frequencies ) depends on the parametrisation , but this fact affects both sides of equation ( [ 5.16 ] ) in the same way . ] of emission and of absorption defined by ( [ 3.1 ] ) . by dividing term by term this equation and equation ( [ 5.15 ] )",
    "we get : @xmath102 therefore , hamilton s theory allows to show that if a photon is emitted by an atom and absorbed by another one in presence of a gravitational field , the ratio energy / frequency is the same for emission and for absorption .",
    "this ratio is independent of the behaviour of the gravitational field and of the state of motion of the two atoms .",
    "thanks to gordon s effective metric ( [ 4.4 ] ) and to the corresponding hamiltonian ( [ 4.8 ] ) it is immediate to extend synge s proof to nondispersive , isotropic dielectrics . the diagram in figure 1 applies also in this case , and the @xmath103 parametrisation remains unaltered .",
    "the metric @xmath104 takes in the hamiltonian the role that @xmath35 had in the previous section , but of course also the latter shall intervene : it is the real metric of spacetime , and _",
    "e.g. _ the line elements @xmath105 and",
    "@xmath106 entering the four - velocities of the atoms and of the medium must be measured by @xmath35 .",
    "we define the null geodesics of the effective spacetime as @xmath107 where @xmath108 and the christoffel connection to be used is now @xmath109 gordon s reduction to the vacuum imposes to model the photon as a null particle of the effective spacetime , and to write @xmath110 where @xmath70 , assumed to be positive , happens to be a constant thanks to ( [ 6.2 ] ) .",
    "since the photon travels with the fundamental velocity of @xmath62 we shall pose @xmath111 where we have adopted gordon s convention of enclosing in round parentheses the indices moved with the effective metric .",
    "we can again model the interaction of the photon with the atom through the equation @xmath112 .",
    "since @xmath113m^im^k\\\\\\nonumber = g_{ik}m^im^k+\\left(1-\\frac{1}{\\epsilon\\mu}\\right)\\left(u_im^i\\right)^2=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one finds @xmath114 since @xmath115 , when measured with the real spacetime metric , the momentum - energy of the photon turns out to be timelike , as it occurs to an ordinary particle , for which a rest coordinate system exists .",
    "therefore one finds @xmath116 instead of ( [ 5.5 ] ) , but for optical processes the last term is negligible when compared to the remaining ones , and one can still define the energy of the photon as in equation ( [ 5.7 ] ) .",
    "the argument of the previous section can now be repeated with the due changes , by starting from the quantity @xmath117 one obtains @xmath118 hence , again with reference to figure 1 : @xmath119 by the same argument as in the previous section : @xmath120 but , because @xmath121m^iu^k = \\frac{m_iu^i}{\\epsilon\\mu},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] instead of ( [ 5.14 ] ) one finds @xmath122 since equation ( [ 5.16 ] ) remains unaltered , instead of ( [ 5.17 ] ) one eventually obtains @xmath123",
    "the photon that we have found through the reduction to the vacuum has the unquestionable virtue of being a timelike entity for which a rest system exists and , as far as a homogeneous medium is considered , it exhibits the proportionality of energy and frequency that a good - natured photon is supposed to possess .",
    "but , as soon as a nonhomogeneous medium is considered , the proportionality disappears , and we are left wondering whether we did some wrong , or whether there is some other opportunity that we have missed .",
    "the hamiltonian point of view tells us that the latter is the case .",
    "in fact , with ( [ 4.8 ] ) there is an ambiguity in the choice of the momentum - energy vector , that is not apparent in the vacuum case .",
    "let us consider the first of hamilton s equations ( [ 2.6 ] ) .",
    "in our case it reads : @xmath124 let @xmath125 be the covariant version of the momentum - energy vector ; it conforms to the usual hamiltonian prescription for material particles .",
    "then @xmath126 in the vacuum case , @xmath68 and @xmath127 are the contravariant and the covariant forms of one and the same entity , whose norm is null .",
    "when @xmath115 , @xmath68 and @xmath128 are expressions of different entities : the first one is a timelike vector , while the second one is spacelike .",
    "let us assume that not @xmath68 , but @xmath128 is the momentum - energy of the photon , by definition the one that is exchanged with an atom in the absorption and emission processes . instead of ( [ 5.4 ] ) we shall postulate @xmath129 if this equation is rewritten in contravariant form and the two forms are multiplied term by term one obtains @xmath130 for optical processes one can neglect the last term and define @xmath131 as the energy exchanged by the photon .",
    "due to ( [ 7.3 ] ) one writes @xmath132p_l = \\epsilon\\mu p_iu^i,\\ ] ] hence , instead of the relation ( [ 6.16 ] ) , @xmath133 fulfils @xmath134",
    "while general relativity in vacuo contains a satisfactory model of the photon as a null particle whose world - line lies in a null wave , and for which the proportionality between energy and frequency holds , the situation is much less encouraging if one attempts defining , by general relativistic methods , a photon in nondispersive , isotropic dielectrics .",
    "the hamiltonian viewpoint shows that in such dielectrics the photon should be a pointlike entity associated to the ray of geometrical optics , that in its turn is permanently associated to a given phase wave , but it shows also that one must choose between two evils : either maintaining the proportionality between energy and frequency at the cost of associating a spacelike momentum to an entity that travels along a timelike ray , or insisting on the natural association of a timelike momentum to the timelike ray at the cost of abandoning , when the dielectric is nonhomogeneous , the proportionality of energy and frequency .",
    "the old dilemma , born with the electromagnetic energy tensors of minkowski @xcite and abraham @xcite and still awaiting for an experimental resolution @xcite , thanks to the methods of gordon @xcite and synge @xcite appears here in a novel form .",
