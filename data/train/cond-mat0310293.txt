    "quantum information processing in charge - based solid state nanostructures has attracted wide spread attention because of the potential scalability of such devices , and the relative ease with which such charge devices can be manipulated and detected.@xcite recently , two - qubit coherent evolution and possibly entanglement have been observed in capacitively coupled cooper pair boxes.@xcite for universal quantum computing , two - qubit operations are required , so that the realization of controlled two - qubit entanglement is regarded as a crucial milestone for the study of solid state quantum computing . while two - qubit information can be detected with one measurement device on each qubit , it is also important to search for a detector that is directly sensitive to two - qubit information , and to develop a proper formalism to study two - qubit measurement processes.@xcite    the ultimate criterion for the detection of qubits is whether we can distinguish the results of a quantum computation by the output signal of the detector , _",
    "e.g. _ current or conductance of a single electron transistor . in the case of one qubit ,",
    "two single - qubit states @xmath0 and @xmath1 need to be distinguished . in the case of two qubits , four two - qubit state , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ( we will call them @xmath6 ) need to be distinguished before the qubit states are destroyed by the measurement . as we mentioned above , measurement of multi - qubit states can generally be achieved by multiple single - qubit measurements on each of the qubits , respectively . here",
    "we study a different detection process : the temporal behavior of a detector ( qpc in the present study ) that simultaneously couples to two qubits .",
    "we show that information contained in the temporal evolution of the qpc current can help us distinguish different two - qubit product states , and some entangled states from the product states .",
    "indeed , one motivation of our study is to obtain direct evidence for the entanglement of the qubits , possibly from the detector current or other measurable quantities .     is the strength of inter - qubit interaction .",

    ", we studied a particular scheme for the quantum measurement of two charge qubits by a two - island single - electron transistor ( set ) , and showed that the set is an effective detector of the two - charge - qubit states . here",
    "the charge qubits are constituted of two coupled quantum dots ( qd ) with one excess electron . due to tunnel coupling of the qds ,",
    "the wave functions in a qubit are superpositions of localized states from each of the qds .",
    "if a qubit is prepared in a single qd state , it tends to oscillate between the two sides of the double qd . if we define the local states as @xmath1 and @xmath7 , the qubit state oscillates between the two logical states with a frequency determined by the tunneling coupling and the difference of the energy - levels of the two qds",
    ". time - dependent behavior of this coherent oscillation of the qubits is determined by the initial state .",
    "if we take the initial time to be that when a final quantum operation is applied to the qubit , the detector readout current reflects the results of quantum calculation .",
    "the qubit states interact with the readout current by changing the energy ( and therefore occupation ) of the electronic states in the set islands and possibly the tunneling rates of the junctions ( by modifying the island electronic states themselves ) on both sides of the islands .",
    "although , in ref .",
    ", we show that the set can distinguish the different coherent oscillations between the two - qubit product states and the entangled states , we have not yet investigated the two - qubit dynamics itself .    here",
    "we would like to study quantum point contact ( qpc ) as a detector for two coupled charge qubits ( fig .",
    "[ qpc ] ) .",
    "a qpc is essentially a one - dimensional conducting channel and is considered to be an effective charge detector , similar to the set .",
    "the particular scheme we consider consists of two low transparency qpcs connected in series through a single level quantum dot .",
    "each of the qpcs is close to a charge qubit so that its current / conductance is dependent on the state of the respective qubit .",
    "compared to the set detector , the qpc detector interacts with qubits only through the change of tunneling rates .",
    "although the set detector is able to describe a variety of features of the internal states of qubits in ref .",
    "@xcite , we could not identify which of the two interactions ( that between the islands and qubits , which modify the level occupations on the set islands ; or that between the tunneling junctions and qubits , where potential by the qubits modifies the tunneling rates ) plays the major role in the set detector .",
    "thus , an important question is whether or not the qpc detector that interacts with qubits only by the change of the tunneling rates is also an effective apparatus for detecting the qubit states . in this paper , after discussing the basic two - qubit dynamics with no detector , we focus mainly on the following issues : ( 1 ) whether we can distinguish the four product states @xmath8 has one electron and is spin - degenerate .",
    "( c ) two - electron dot  state @xmath9 has two electrons in a spin singlet state occupying the same orbital state.,width=226 ]",
    "in the present measurement scheme , the qpcs are capacitively coupled to the charge qubits ( fig .  [ qpc ] ) , so that the current through them sensitively depends on the states of the qubits .",
    "we describe the two qpcs using two tunnel matrix elements only and neglect further internal structures.@xcite we assume that the qubit - qpc coupling is purely capacitive , so that there is no current flowing from the qubits to either of the qpc electrodes .",
    "the hamiltonian for the combined two qubits and the qpcs is written as @xmath10 .",

    ", we observed that the two - island set can represent a variety of qubit states because of its large number of degrees of freedom . with a much simpler state structure for the present coupled qpc scheme , we will study whether the qpc current could still represent the qubit states with sufficient clarity .",

    "we assume that the tunneling strength of electrons weakly depends on the energy @xmath44 and electrodes are degenerate up to the fermi surface .",
    "then the qubit - qpc interaction dictates that qubit states influence the qpc tunneling rate in the form of @xmath45 and @xmath46(e ) @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is the density of states of the electrodes ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "hereafter , we use @xmath50s and @xmath51s estimated at the fermi energy @xmath52 of the electrodes to describe the tunneling rate in the detection process of the qubit states by the two qpcs .",
    "this is reasonable from a practical standpoint since many experiments are described using @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "the values of the corresponding @xmath50s are determined by the structure of the system such as the distance between the qubits and the qpcs .",
    "for example , a @xmath21 state ( @xmath20 state ) in a qubit means the excess charge is localized in the lower ( upper ) dot , so that the corresponding tunneling rate should be @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "therefore , two - qubit state @xmath56 would lead to qpc tunneling rates of @xmath57 or @xmath58 , depending on whether or not the island between the qpcs is doubly occupied .",

    "we construct the equations for the qubit - qpc density matrix elements at zero temperature @xmath68 , following the procedure developed by gurvitz.@xcite this method is applicable when the energy level of the inter - qpc island is in between the chemical potentials of the two electrodes .",

    "the basis states for the qpc can then be constructed from @xmath70 by moving electrons from the left electrode ( with higher chemical potential ) to the inter - qpc island and the right electrode .",
    "we categorize the detector states by the number of electrons that are transferred from the left to the right electrode ( fig .",

    "we quantify the strength of the measurement by dephasing rates defined as @xmath104 where @xmath17 .",
    "these rates are the coefficients of the off - diagonal density - matrix elements of the time - dependent reduced density matrix equations for the qubits .",

    ", where there is a single off - diagonal density - matrix element , we can not define a single dephasing rate because of the complexity of our density - matrix equations .",
    "current of a qpc in the tunneling regime is very sensitive to the potential variations of the qds that are set close to the qpc channel.@xcite we thus can choose from a wide range of parameters for our qpcs .",
    "here we use a particular set of representative parameters : @xmath106 which lead to @xmath107 for a typical case ( @xmath108 is a tunneling rate in the absence of the qubits , so that dephasing rate is more than one order of magnitude smaller , corresponding to a relatively weak measurement ) .",
    "we can regard @xmath109 as the typical measurement time .",
    "obviously , the qubit dynamics ( represented by tunneling rate @xmath110 ) would be able to be detected when @xmath111 .",
    "because , in the present setup , the current without qubits saturates in the range of @xmath112 , the time @xmath113 would serve as a standard of when measurement started .",
    "we can also incorporate the effect of coulomb interaction by setting @xmath114 as a limiting case of strong on - site coulomb blockade ( @xmath115 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : h_qpc ] ) so that no double occupation is possible ) , while for weak coulomb interaction on the island we can set @xmath116 at the limit of @xmath117 .",
    "in order to better understand our numerical results and the capability of our qpc detector , it is instructive to first examine the dynamics of both a single qubit and two qubits in the absence of any detector , and discuss how the qubit dynamics is measured by the detector .",

    ". the oscillatory component of the qpc current should thus be dominated by a @xmath126 component ( in the case of @xmath127 , @xmath128 ) , and the temporal evolution of the current is intimately related to the initial state .",
    "we can also infer information on the two - qubit product states from the detector current in a similar manner because density matrices of the product states are written as @xmath129 and so on . here",
    "we solve the two - qubit dynamics in the absence of the detector by expanding the density matrix on the basis spanned by the bell states : @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 ( singlet state ) .",
    "if we assume two identical qubits ( @xmath134 and @xmath135 ) , the density matrix equations for the two qubits ( without the qpc detector : @xmath136 ) are written as @xmath137 if @xmath119 , which again corresponds to the optimal operational point , the density matrix equations can be classified into four groups ( indicated by the four parentheses above ) .",
    "first of all , eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : e1 ] ) shows that the probabilities in @xmath138 and @xmath139 states are time - independent . on the other hand , according to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : e2 ] ) , the probabilities in @xmath140 and @xmath141 states oscillate as a function of @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) .",

    "( [ eqn : e3 ] ) and ( [ eqn : e4 ] ) indicate that the off - diagonal elements @xmath144 contain @xmath145 type of oscillations .",

    "therefore , we should be able to distinguish pure entangled states from pure product states @xmath150 @xmath151 @xmath152 based on whether the detected period of the coherent oscillations is limited to @xmath153 ( @xmath154 and @xmath141 ) or time - independent ( @xmath138 and @xmath155 ) in the limit of weak interaction between the qubits and the qpcs .",
    "such behavior is indeed evident in our results as shown in the following section .",
    "in ref . , we clarified three major issues regarding the capability of the two - island set by monitoring its time - dependent readout current : ( 1 ) the two - qubit product states ( eigenstates in the absence of inter - qubit interaction and inter - dot coupling within each qubit ) @xmath156 can be distinguished ; ( 2 ) pure entangled states and pure product states can be distinguished ; ( 3 ) quantum zeno effect is present in a two - qubit system . in the following",
    "we show that similar results are obtained for the serially - coupled qpc detector despite its simpler state structure .",
    "figure  [ i - v ] shows the time - dependent current at small time @xmath157 in the case of weak coulomb interaction ( @xmath117 ) ( @xmath158 ) assuming that initially the two qubits are in one of the four product states . to calculate the current when the two - qubit initial state is @xmath150 , for example , we set @xmath159 and the other coefficients to zero in the total wave function ( eqs .",

    "the reason is that there is a finite bias between the left and right electrodes , so that current flows only in one direction .",
    "consequently , @xmath164 , with the left qubit electron in the upper dot ( thus less suppression on current ) , produces a faster rise in current than @xmath163 . since the product states are not the two - qubit eigenstates , they evolve into superposition states and the corresponding qpc current oscillates",
    "nevertheless , we can distinguish the four initial product states by the values of the readout current in both @xmath165 and @xmath166 cases .",

    "[ entangled ] and [ general ] .",
    "a qualitative reason is that the wave functions of the entangled states in the charge qubits extend over both qubits compared to the product states , so that the charge distribution of the entangled states is less effective in influencing the readout current .",

    "figure ( c ) shows that the two - qubit state begins to include states other than the singlet states , resulting in the oscillation of the current ( panel ( a ) ) when @xmath185 becomes large.,width=309 ]",
    "in our study so far we have demonstrated that two - charge - qubit state information can be clearly revealed by the transient current variations in a serially coupled qpc charge detector .",
    "an important question is then whether such current evolutions are experimentally observable . in our calculation , @xmath108 , the qpc tunneling rate , is the physical quantity that can be directly connected to experiments . for example , for @xmath108 in the order of 100 mhz , figs .",
    "[ i - v ] , [ entangled ] and [ new ] show that our scheme requires measurement of a 1 pa current that changes in the nanosecond time scale .",
    "this is at the edge of the current technology that allows the measurement of 1 pa current with dynamics in the ghz frequency range with repeated - measurement technique.@xcite    one issue we have been trying to address in this study is to compare the measurement capability of a qpc detector and an set detector . in terms of the theoretical descriptions of the qubit - detector interaction , the major difference between the qpc detector studied here and the set detector in ref.@xcite is that we model each qpc by a tunnel junction ( ref.@xcite ) , so that the qpc - qubit interaction directly modifies strength of tunneling , while in ref.@xcite , the set - qubit interaction influences both the set island state energy and the island - lead tunneling . despite these differences , our numerical results showed that the current through the coupled qpc exhibits behaviors similar to those of the two - island set current in many respects , such as in distinguishing the different qubit product states , in distinguishing the bell - type entangled states from the product states , and in the observation of quantum zeno effect for the qubit product states .",
    "stronger differences between qpc and set detectors do appear when the qubit - detector interaction strength increases .",
    "the measurement current of the detector that has a larger number of internal degrees of freedom ( the two - island set ) seems to be able to describe more elaborate quantum states of the two qubits .",
    "for example , the set current can clearly distinguish the four product states shown in ref .",
    ", while with the present qpc detector the current shows a simpler structure and smaller differences for the different qubit states .",
    "qualitatively , the tunneling rate of a qpc is generally larger than that of an set , which corresponds to shorter dwelling time for the qpc ( in the present study the dwelling time for qpcs is effectively taken to be zero ) .",
    "this difference essentially originates from the simpler structure of a qpc compared to an set . in the present study we obtained the density - matrix equations under the condition",
    "that the voltage bias between the left and right electrodes is sufficiently large such that the left - right symmetry is broken and the transmission of electrons from the right electrode to the left can be neglected .",
    "thus we can not directly calculate the qpc differential conductance , which would provide more information for some experiments.@xcite this is one of the limitations of the present method .",
    "an approach that can properly deal with low bias situations is still in development .",
    "our configuration of the qubit - qpc coupling scheme can be straightforwardly extended to @xmath200(@xmath201-qubit detection .",
    "however , it depends strongly on the sensitivity of the current readout circuit such that the @xmath202 states can be differentiated,@xcite and is thus better suited for only a small number of qubits . in any case , the key objective of the present study is to obtain two - qubit information directly and dynamically , not to invent a general detector for a multi - qubit system , for which other configurations such as a typical one - detector - per - qubit setup are probably more suitable and have to be further studied both experimentally and theoretically.@xcite furthermore , we have considered an ideal measurement process in the present study . in a more realistic situation , imperfections such as gate operation errors,@xcite charge fluctuations around the qubit - qpc systems,@xcite and phonons have to be considered .",
    "these imperfections could seriously reduce the sensitivity of a measuring device .",
    "thus more detailed analysis for the coupled multiqubit - detector system needs to be carried out in the future to further clarify these issues .",
    "we have solved master equations and described various time - dependent measurement processes of two charge qubits by two serially - coupled qpcs .",
    "the current through the qpcs is shown to be an effective means to measure the results of quantum calculations and the presence of entangled states .",
    "two - qubit dynamics is studied analytically and it is found that period of coherent oscillation depends on their initial state .",
    "our results thus show that the serially - coupled qpc can be an effective detector of two - qubit states of a pair of ( coupled ) charge qubits .",
