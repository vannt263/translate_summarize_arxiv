    "in their paper @xcite fomin and zelevinsky introduced a remarkable algebraic object called cluster algebras .",
    "the original motivation was to provide a combinatorial model for studying total positivity and lusztig s canonical bases for semisimple lie groups .",
    "it was quickly realized however that cluster algebras are rather ubiquitous in mathematics , appearing for example in the representation theory of quivers and finite - dimensional algebras , poisson geometry , teichmller theory , integrable systems , and the study of donaldson - thomas invariants .",
    "the core idea of cluster algebras is that the generators of a commutative algebra , called _",
    "cluster variables _ , are grouped into sets called _",
    "clusters_. a _ seed _ consists of a cluster together with a polynomial , called the _ exchange polynomial _ ,",
    "associated with each cluster variable .",
    "the exchange polynomial must be a polynomial in the other variables of this cluster , and is always a binomial .",
    "one can then apply a _ mutation procedure _ to a variable in a cluster , exchanging it for a different variable according to the following rule : @xmath0 the exchange polynomials are also mutated , producing a mutated seed from the old seed .",
    "one key remarkable property of such systems then is the _",
    "laurent phenomenon _ , which says that any cluster variable is a laurent polynomial when written as a rational function in any other cluster .    from the onset of the theory",
    "it was known that the laurent phenomenon holds in a more general setting , where the exchange polynomials are not necessarily binomials : fomin and zelevinsky @xcite established the laurent phenomenon for a number of families of combinatorial recurrences , including the somos sequences , the cube recurrence , and the gale - robinson sequence .",
    "however , the work of @xcite depended on already knowing the global pattern of exchange polynomials , the laurentness with respect to which one is trying to establish .",
    "what @xcite does _ not _ provide is a rule on how to derive the global exchange pattern from knowing only the local one in an initial seed , which is what is achieved for cluster algebras . in this work ,",
    "we propose a method to propagate arbitrary ( irreducible ) exchange polynomials .",
    "we then prove that the laurent phenomenon always holds , and we call our new algebras _ laurent phenomenon algebras _ , or _",
    "lp algebras_. the new paradigm of mutation that we offer is as follows : @xmath1 here the laurent polynomial on the right hand side is equal to the exchange polynomial of the variable divided by a monomial in the rest of the variables in the same cluster .",
    "the exchange polynomials of a seed determine its exchange laurent polynomials .",
    "let us list some features of cluster algebras which extend , or conjecturally extend to lp algebras :    1 .",
    "the laurent phenomenon ( theorem [ t : laurent ] ) holds for lp algebras ( cf .",
    "2 .   there is a rich theory of finite types , and the associated cluster complexes appear to be polytopal complexes with rich combinatorics ; see sections [ sec : r2 ] and [ sec : ex ] ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in @xcite",
    "we study lp algebras with a linear seed , and in particular we show that the number of finite types of lp algebras grows exponentially with rank .",
    "3 .   the cluster monomials appear to be linearly independent , and for finite type lp algebras appear to form linear bases ( cf .",
    "4 .   for a suitable initial seed ,",
    "the cluster variables appear to be laurent polynomials with _ positive _ coefficients ; see section [ sec : r2 ] and @xcite .",
    "there are interesting examples of lp algebras of _ finite mutation type _ ; see section [ sec : ex ] ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . 6 .",
    "the coefficients of exchange polynomials satisfy interesting dynamics under mutation ; see section [ sec : r2 ] ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . 7 .",
    "beautiful combinatorial recurrences occur as exchange relations of lp algebras , including the gale - robinson sequence and cube recurrence ; see section [ sec : ex ] ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . 8 .",
    "lp algebras appear naturally as coordinate rings of lie groups or certain varieties naturally associated to lie groups ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    let us elaborate on the last point .",
    "the initial motivating examples of cluster algebras were the coordinate rings of double bruhat cells of semisimple lie groups @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we constructed a family of _ electrical lie groups _ naturally associated with electrical networks in a disk .",
    "the positive parts of these electrical lie groups come with a decomposition into cells analogous to the bruhat decomposition of the totally positive part of the unipotent subgroup of a semisimple group .",
    "the dynamics of parametrizations of these cells is controlled by _",
    "electrical lp algebras _ in the same way the dynamics of parametrizations of bruhat cells is controlled by cluster algebras @xcite . in the upcoming work",
    "@xcite we shall explain the details .",
    "we refer the reader to section [ sec : ex ] for an example .",
    "let us list some differences between cluster algebras and laurent phenomenon algebras :    1 .   for certain initial seeds , the cluster algebra generated by that seed may not be the same as the lp algebra generated by that seed ; in corollary [ c : cluster ]",
    "we show that this never happens if the cluster algebra has principal coefficients .",
    "2 .   in the definition of seed mutation of a lp algebra , a substitution is first made in an exchange polynomial and then a ( possibly very interesting ) polynomial factor is removed ; in the cluster case this factor is always just a monomial .",
    "3 .   in a lp algebra",
    "it is possible for the exchange polynomial of one cluster variable to depend on another cluster variable , while the reverse is not true ; in the cluster case this relation is always symmetric .",
    "4 .   in a lp algebra mutation",
    "a priori depends on the exchange polynomials of all cluster variables of the seed , including cluster variables which are not being mutated .",
    "the extent to which this dependence is not present is a very interesting question , a special case of which is addressed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.4 ) . in the cluster case",
    "_ freezing _ a variable by never mutating it is straightforward . 5 .   in a lp algebra ,",
    "the _ cluster complex _ that describes which variables can belong to the same cluster is not necessarily a flag complex ( that is , it is not necessarily given by just pairwise compatibility ) , see remark [ rem : flag ] ; this property is known to hold for cluster algebras arising from surfaces , and is conjectured in general @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : seeds ] we define seeds and seed mutation of lp algebras , and establish their basic properties . in section [ sec : lp ] we give the definition of lp algebras . in section [ sec : lpcl ] we compare cluster algebras with lp algebras , and discuss sufficient conditions for a cluster algebra to be a lp algebra . in section [ sec : cat ] we prove that the laurent phenomenon holds for lp algebras . in section [ sec : r2 ] we give a complete classification of rank two lp algebras of finite type . in section [ sec : ex ] we discuss several interesting families of examples of lp algebras , recovering and explaining connections to the work of chekhov and shapiro @xcite , hone @xcite , and henriques and speyer @xcite .",

    "the mutation dynamics that we shall discuss sometimes behave properly even for seeds @xmath38 not satisfying the irreducibility condition of ( lp1 ) , though in all the examples we have encountered we can reduce to consider a seed @xmath39 which does satisfy ( lp1 ) , for example by changing the coefficient ring , or by introducing new coefficients .    for each seed @xmath17 , we define a collection @xmath40 of _ exchange laurent polynomials _ by the conditions :    * @xmath41 for some @xmath42 * @xmath43 \\ ; \\mbox{and is not divisible by $ f_j$}\\ ] ] + the divisibility is to be checked in @xmath44 $ ] .",
