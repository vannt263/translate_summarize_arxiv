    "the _ de broglie - bohm quantum trajectories _ @xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite have been considered as an interpretational tool in a number of recent applications ( see @xcite@xcite@xcite for reviews ) , since they can offer new insight into a variety of complex quantum phenomena . according to the de broglie - bohm theory , to any wavefunction @xmath4 describing a @xmath5particle system , we can associate a set of ` quantum trajectories ' .",
    "one trajectory is defined by the initial conditions @xmath6 and by the ` pilot wave ' equations of motion @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the particle masses and @xmath9 is planck s constant .",
    "the equations of motion ( [ sch2 ] ) imply the continuity equation for the probability density @xmath10 .",
    "then , the pilot - wave equations guarantee the preservation of born s rule @xmath11 at all subsequent times @xmath12 . furthermore , the de broglie - bohm trajectories are equivalent to the stream lines of the quantum probability current @xmath13 . thus",
    ", the bohmian approach yields practically equivalent results to madelung s quantum hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the de broglie - bohm theory has been discussed extensively from the point of view of its relevance as a consistent interpretation of quantum mechanics ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ; see @xcite for an extended list of references ) .",
    "however , the employment of the de broglie - bohm trajectories has been proven useful also in many _",
    "practical _ aspects of the study of quantum systems .",
    "some modern applications are :    \\i ) visualization of quantum processes : examples are barrier penetration or the quantum tunneling effect @xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite , the ( particle ) two - slit experiment @xcite , ballistic transport through ` quantum wires ' @xcite@xcite , molecular dynamics @xcite , dynamics in nonlinear systems with classical focal points or caustics @xcite , and rotational or atom - surface scattering @xcite @xcite@xcite .",
    "\\ii ) lagrangian solvers of schrdinger equation via swarms of evolving bohmian trajectories ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review , as well as @xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite ) .",
    "the interest in this method lies in that , instead of solving schrdinger s equation first , one uses a step - by - step procedure to calculate the trajectories via newton s second order equations of motion in a potential @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the ` quantum potential ' , caused by the wavefunction @xmath16 : @xmath17 using the information of the initial value of the wavefunction as well as the evolution of the quantum trajectories , the wavefunction can then be determined at any subsequent time step .",
    "\\iii ) dynamical origin of the _ quantum relaxation _",
    "@xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the de broglie - bohm theory offers a justification of born s rule @xmath18 , since it predicts that , under some conditions , the quantum trajectories lead to an asymptotic ( in time ) approach towards this rule even if it was initially allowed that @xmath19 .",
    "it should be noted that not all choices of @xmath20 are guaranteed to lead to quantum relaxation , and counter - examples can be found , for reasons explained in @xcite .",
    "the arguments used in that paper to explain the suppression of the quantum relaxation effect in the two - slit experiment apply also to many other cases ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , a necessary condition for quantum relaxation to take place is that the trajectories should exhibit _ chaotic _ behavior ( see @xcite @xcite ) ; however , even this condition is not sufficient ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the problem of chaos in the de broglie - bohm theory has been studied extensively ( indicative references are @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite ) .",
    "we have worked on this problem in @xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "our main result was that chaos is due to the presence of _ moving quantum vortices _ forming ` nodal point - x - point complexes ' ( @xcite@xcite@xcite ; see also @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "quantitative studies of chaos and of the effects of vortices are presented in @xcite@xcite@xcite . in particular , in @xcite we made a theoretical analysis of the dependence of lyapunov exponents of the quantum trajectories on the size and speed of the quantum vortices , thus explaining numerical results found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite we gave examples of systems which do or do not exhibit quantum relaxation , depending on whether or not their underlying trajectories are chaotic .",
    "it should be emphasized that , besides chaos , the quantum vortices play a key role in a variety of quantum dynamical phenomena ( e.g. @xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite ) .",
    "\\iv ) _ arrival times and times of flight_. in the traditional formulation of quantum mechanics time is only a parameter in schrdinger s equation , since by a theorem of pauli @xcite no definition of a self - adjoint time - operator consistent with all axioms of quantum mechanics can be given in a system with energy spectrum bounded from below .",
    "time , however , is an experimental observable .",
    "various approaches in the literature , reviewed in @xcite@xcite , have addressed the question of a consistent definition of quantum probability distributions for time observables . besides the bohmian approach ,",
    "two other approaches are : a ) the ` sum - over - histories ' approach @xcite@xcite based on feynman paths , and b ) the approach of kijowski @xcite , based on the definition of quantum states acted upon by the so - called bohm - aharonov operator ( see @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , the de broglie - bohm approach gives a straightforward answer to this problem , since the time needed to connect any two points along a quantum trajectory is a well defined quantity ( see @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "regarding this latter point , a key remark that will concern us in the sequel is that a consistent definition of the arrival times , that would allow in principle for a comparison of the various approaches in specific quantum systems , is only possible provided that the initial wavefunction is _ localized in space _ ,",
    "i.e. it is described by a wavepacket model .",
    "being motivated by the latter remark , in the present paper we present a study of the de broglie - bohm trajectories in a wavepacket model referring to a quantum phenomenon that has played a fundamental role in the development of quantum mechanics , namely the _ diffraction _ of charged particles ( e.g. electrons or ions ) by a thin material target .",
    "a theoretical study on the quantum scattering problem in the framework of the de broglie - bohm approach has been presented in the series of works @xcite@xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite .",
    "these studies refer to the establishment of the rules of scattering probabilities using the ` flux across surfaces ' theorem adapted to the concept of quantum trajectories . however , they do not deal with the form of the quantum trajectories or the emergence of diffraction patterns under specific scattering potentials .",
    "a numerical simulation of rutherford scattering by a single nucleus has been presented in @xcite , while in @xcite the phenomena of atom - surface scattering as well as neutron diffraction by slits are considered , which share some common features , but also important differences , with our problem .    in the present paper",
    "we make a detailed study of the de broglie - bohm trajectories in the context of a wavepacket model of charged particle diffraction , by first investigating the form of the _ quantum currents _ corresponding to various cases of this model .",
    "these cases are diversified one from the other by the different quantitative relations characterizing the so - called _ quantum coherence lengths _ in the longitudinal and transverse directions of the charged particle beam .",
    "this is necessary in order to be able to compare the results corresponding to possibly different experimental realizations of a charged particle beam , as e.g. in the case of electrons produced either by thermionic or by a cold - field emission processes .",
    "our present study completes in a substantial way the study initiated in a previous paper of ours @xcite , in which we implemented the de broglie - bohm approach in the case of electron diffraction through a thin crystal . in that study",
    ", however , we assumed a planar wave model for the propagation of the electron wavefunction in the longitudinal direction .",
    "in contrast , in the present paper we assume instead a finite longitudinal quantum coherence length .",
    "this assumption leads to a number of crucial new elements with respect to @xcite .",
    "in fact , in order to achieve our goal we derive a wavefunction model by a refined implementation of basic scattering theory , so as to account for a fully - localized in space description of scattering .",
    "the derivation of this model presents its own interest , and it is exposed in detail in section 2 .     in the longitudinal direction ( z - axis @xmath21 direction of incidence to a thin material target ( c ) placed at the center o of the coordinate system ) , and @xmath22 in the transverse direction .",
    "after scattering , some particles arrive at detectors @xmath23 placed at equal distances from o and various angles @xmath24 .",
    "the wavefunction is assumed to have axial symmetry ( around the z - axis ) , thus the figure corresponds to any meridian plane .",
    "various other symbols are explained in the text . ]",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : after the derivation of the basic wavefunction model in section 2 , we pass to a study of the quantum trajectories in section 3 . here",
    "the emphasis is on the influence upon the trajectories of quantum vortices , whose appearance and role in this problem are explicitly discussed .",
    "in fact , we show that the quantum vortices appear in the transition zone from a domain of predominance of the ingoing wavefunction to a domain of predominance of the outgoing wavefunction . inside this zone",
    "we can define a locus called _ separator _ , which plays a key role in the interpretation of the scattering process via the quantum trajectories . in section 4",
    "we study the arrival times of diffracted particles to detectors placed in various scattering angles .",
    "a main outcome of this study is that it is possible to propose a feasible experimental test probing the predictions of the bohmian theory about the particles arrival times . in section 5",
    "we discuss separately the ` semi - classical ' case of particles with a large mass and and a small de broglie wavelength , applicable e.g. to @xmath25particle or ion scattering , since this case exhibits some special features in comparison to the case of electron diffraction .",
    "finally , section 6 summarizes the main conclusions of the present study .",
    "we consider a cylindrical beam of particles of mass @xmath26 and charge @xmath27 incident on a thin material target .",
    "we set the center of the target as the origin of our coordinate system of reference , and use both cylindrical coordinates @xmath28 and spherical coordinates @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath30axis is the beam s main axis , @xmath31 denotes cylindrical radius transversally to @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the azimuth , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( see figure 1 , schematic ) .",
    "a basic form of diffraction theory for charged particles , reviewed e.g. in @xcite , assumes that the incident waves are planar .",
    "as explained in the introduction , here instead we are interested in a wavepacket approach . focusing only on elastic scattering phenomena ,",
    "the latter approach can be obtained by a refinement of the basic theory as follows :    the potential felt by a charged particle approaching the target can be considered as the sum of the individual potential terms generated by every atom in the target : @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the position of j - th atom in the lattice of the target ( this position exhibits some statistical fluctuations due to thermal oscillations etc ; the effect of these fluctuations is discussed later in this section ) . as a model for the function @xmath38 , we can adopt a screened coulomb potential @xmath39 ( @xmath40 = vacuum dielectric constant ) , where @xmath41 is the nuclear charge , and @xmath42 is a constant representing a charge screening range within the atoms , whose value is of the order of the atomic size .",
    "+ particles being scattered by the target can be described by a wavefunction given as a superposition of eigenfunctions @xmath43 where @xmath44 are fourier coefficients , and @xmath45 are scattering eigenfunctions , i.e. solutions of the time - independent schrdinger s equation @xmath46 with @xmath47 chosen as in ( [ pot ] ) and @xmath48 .",
    "the different solutions @xmath49 are labeled by their wavevectors @xmath50 of modulus @xmath51 , where @xmath48 is the energy associated with one eigenstate . born s approximation can be used to obtain an approximative formula for @xmath52 . we thus write @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the solution of eq.([sch1 ] ) for the free particle problem @xmath55 , while @xmath56 , @xmath57 etc ( assuming that @xmath47 small compared to the particles energies ) .",
    "the above series are meaningful at all points of space excluding a set of balls of radius a few times @xmath42 around every one of the atoms in the target .",
    "spherical harmonic expansions ( see e.g. @xcite ) provide a more accurate representation of the solution inside such balls , but their use is cumbersome while practically unnecessary in the context of the present study .",
    "a step by step determination of the series terms in ( [ bornser ] ) can be obtained via the recursive formula @xmath58 all essential phenomena discussed below are present already in the solutions including just the two first terms @xmath59 . from eq.([sch1ret ] ) for @xmath60 we find : @xmath61 the integral in ( [ phi1 ] ) can be estimated using standard approximations of scattering theory .",
    "we then find @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the angle between the vectors @xmath50 and @xmath64 .      at distances",
    "@xmath97 closer to the target than the maximum of the two coherence lengths @xmath98 , the prefactor @xmath99 in eq.([psiout ] ) is no longer accurate . in order to be able to perform some numerical calculations of de broglie - bohm trajectories , after numerically simulating the sums appearing in ( [ psiall2 ] ) we found by trial a fitting model that represents reasonably well the modifications of @xmath100 close to the target .",
    "this reads : @xmath101^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are fitting constants determined by comparison of eq.([fit ] ) to the results of the numerical simulation of @xmath100 ( in all simulations below we set @xmath104 , @xmath105 ) .",
    "it is to be stressed that eq.([fit ] ) correctly recovers the asymptotic form @xmath106 when @xmath97 is large .",
    "the outgoing wavefunction now takes the form @xmath107 where the quantity @xmath108 is called hereafter the ` effective fraunhoffer function ' ( in analogy with the ` far field ' diffraction limit in wave optics , see @xcite ) .",
    "this is given by @xmath109~~.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the physical significance of the function @xmath110 is that it sums the contributions of all the atoms in the target which act as sources of partial outgoing waves , whose superposition forms @xmath82 . furthermore , the function @xmath111 accounts for the formation of a diffraction pattern , which , for given @xmath112 , @xmath97 , arises by the coherent contributions of all atoms in the target whose phasors @xmath113 $ ] are nearly parallel one to the other . as in @xcite",
    ", we consider the simplest example of a cubic lattice structure of the target @xmath114 where i ) @xmath115 is the lattice constant ( equal to the length of one side of the primitive cell ) ii ) @xmath116 is the amplitude of some random oscillations ( due to thermal or recoil motions ; @xmath116 is taken equal to a small fraction of @xmath115 ) and @xmath117 are random variables with a uniform distribution in the intervals @xmath118 $ ] ( the random oscillations introduce a so - called debye - waller effect , analyzed in @xcite ; here , for simplicity , we ignore modifications on the wavefunction due to this effect ) .",
    "iii ) the number of atoms @xmath119 in the z - direction is @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the target thickness , and iv ) the value of @xmath122 is of order @xmath123 , due to the gaussian factor @xmath124 in eq.([seff ] ) which can be approximated by @xmath125 for all @xmath126 and @xmath127 , and by @xmath128 for @xmath129 or @xmath130 ( for typical magnitudes of @xmath22 the inequality @xmath131 holds for all times @xmath12 of interest in our study , see below ) .",
    "we now distinguish the following cases :      when the longitudinal coherence length @xmath78 is larger than the transverse coherence length @xmath22 , a simple modeling of the sum in eq.([seff ] ) becomes possible at all distances @xmath133 .",
    "ignoring first the random fluctuations in ( [ lattice ] ) ( i.e. setting @xmath134 ) , we have @xmath135 whereby it follows that @xmath136\\right)\\\\ & \\times&\\sum_{n_z =- n_z/2}^{n_z/2 } \\exp\\left(ik_0[(1-\\cos\\theta)n_za+{n_z^2a^2\\over 2r}]\\right)\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a random choice of @xmath137 , the total number of contributing atoms in the sums of eq.([sefflong ] ) is of the order @xmath138 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath139 phasors have an effectively random phase .",
    "thus , the total sum is of order @xmath140 , and we are lead to the simple estimate @xmath141\\ ] ] called , hereafter , the ` diffuse term ' of the effective fraunhofer function .",
    "using this term we have @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the number density of the atoms in the target .",
    "the model ( [ psioutl2 ] ) is used in a number of numerical simulations below .",
    "it describes a _ radial pulse _ propagating outwards with speed @xmath2 , which emerges from the center at the time @xmath144 .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that eq.([psioutl2 ] ) requires modifications close to particular angles where the phasors in the sums of ( [ sefflong ] ) are added coherently . this will be examined in subsection 3.3 .",
    "further modifications are required when @xmath78 and @xmath22 become comparable or smaller than the inter - atomic distance @xmath115 in the target .",
    "this case is examined in section 5 .",
    "the modeling of @xmath111 is a more subtle problem if the transverse coherence length is larger than the longitudinal coherence length . without loss of generality",
    ", we can consider a fixed meridian plane defined e.g. by the angle @xmath146 .",
    "we set @xmath147 and we make the change of variables @xmath148 , @xmath149 .",
    "considering now a random choice of @xmath150 , and ignoring the quantity @xmath151 , for a given value of @xmath152 the sum over the variables @xmath153 in eq.([seff ] ) can by approximated by a sum over a domain of values of @xmath154 such that @xmath155 belongs to a ball of radius @xmath78 around @xmath152 .",
    "the total number of contributing atoms is then of order @xmath156 .",
    "if i ) we consider the sum over the phasors as a sum of random numbers ( yielding a total magnitude @xmath157 ) , and ii ) we substitute the second exponential in ( [ seff ] ) by a delta function around @xmath152 , we find @xmath158 , where @xmath159 and @xmath160 is the determinant of the jacobian matrix of the transformation @xmath161 .",
    "we find @xmath162 where @xmath163 , @xmath164 .",
    "eq.([iseff ] ) yields non - zero values of the integral @xmath165 _ below _ a cut - off radius @xmath166 . however , the asymptotic behavior of @xmath165 when @xmath97 is large is found by noticing that @xmath167 and @xmath168 in this limit .",
    "we then find @xmath169 the essential point to retain is that the profile of the radial outgoing pulse in the case @xmath170 is a gaussian whose dispersion is of order @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the conclusion is that , in both cases @xmath171 or @xmath172 , the outgoing wavefunction has always the form of a packet with dispersion @xmath173 of the same order as the _ largest _ of the two quantum coherence lengths , i.e. @xmath174 .",
    "furthermore , we notice that in the case @xmath170 the dispersion @xmath173 depends also on @xmath88 .",
    "a detailed investigation of the bohmian trajectories in this case is , however , not possible from a numerical point of view , because the asymptotic formulae ( [ iseff ] ) and ( [ isefflim ] ) are not valid at distances @xmath175 , where the scattering effects take place .",
    "thus in the sequel we limit ourselves to a detailed investigation of the bohmian trajectories in the case @xmath176 , while a qualitative discussion of the case @xmath170 will be made in section 4 , referring to the issue of the particles arrival time distribution .",
    "we now discuss the main features of the de broglie - bohm quantum trajectories focusing on the case @xmath176 .",
    "the form of the trajectories can be found by carefully examining the structure of the quantum currents @xmath13 .",
    "the main remark is that , due to eqs.([psiin ] ) and ( [ psioutl2 ] ) , the ingoing wavefunction term ( which has a gaussian form both in the @xmath31 and @xmath32 directions ) has a falling exponential profile at large distances from the center of the gaussian , while the outgoing wavefunction has a more complex form falling asymptotically as a power - law @xmath177 due to the factor @xmath178 .",
    "thus , there is an inner domain of the quantum flow where @xmath179 prevails , and an outer domain where @xmath82 prevails .",
    "we call _ separator _ the boundary delimiting the two domains .",
    "formally , the separator is defined as the ( time - evolving ) geometric locus where @xmath180 ) , the condition ( [ separcon ] ) takes the form : @xmath181 where we use the approximations @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "we note that these approximations hold within a range of parameter values relevant to concrete experimental setups . for example , assuming that incident particles have velocities of order @xmath184 m/s , the time required to travel a distance of order @xmath185 ",
    "( which is the typical size of an experimental setup ) is of the order of @xmath187  @xmath188s .",
    "on the other hand , the typical coherence lengths in experiments e.g. for electrons are of order 1@xmath189 m or larger .",
    "hence , @xmath190 is much smaller than @xmath191 or @xmath192 .    , @xmath193 , @xmath194 and @xmath195 in the model where",
    "@xmath179 is given by eq.([psiin ] ) , @xmath82 is given by eq.([psioutl2 ] ) , and the parameters are @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198nm@xmath199 ( corresponding to electrons with energy @xmath200kev , or wavelength @xmath201 nm ) , @xmath202 nm , @xmath203 nm ( corresponding to transverse and longitudinal quantum coherence lengths 1@xmath189 m and 10@xmath189 m respectively ) , @xmath204 , @xmath205 ( gold ) , @xmath206 nm , @xmath207 nm . ( b ) the form of the quantum current flow at the snapshot @xmath208 . ]    nm , @xmath209 nm in the model with parameters as in fig.[septor ] at the time @xmath210 .",
    "the thick solid curves show the unstable ( u , u ) and stable ( s , s ) asymptotic manifolds of the x - point ( x ) formed under the instantaneous portrait of the quantum flow . ]",
    "the time evolution of the separator in the plane @xmath211 depends now on the time evolution of the relative amplitude of the ingoing compared to the outgoing wave at any point of the configuration space .",
    "we note first that according to eq.([psioutl2 ] ) , the outgoing wave corresponds to a wavepacket with dispersion @xmath78 which emerges from the center in the time interval @xmath212 , with @xmath213 , @xmath214 , which is the interval during which the support of the ingoing wavepacket ( moving from left to right in figs.[setup ] and [ septor ] ) essentially overlaps with the spatial domain occupied by the atoms in the target ( see @xcite for an introductory description of this phenomenon in a simple rutherford scattering case ) . as indicated by eq.([psioutl2 ] ) , after its emergence the outgoing wave moves in all radial directions maintaining essentially its gaussian profile , while its overall amplitude drops like @xmath215 .",
    "as the outgoing wave moves outwards , it first encounters the ingoing wavepacket at times close to @xmath216 . in fig.[septor]a",
    ", this encounter results in a gradual approach of the separator towards the z - axis ( the indicated times are @xmath217 , @xmath218 , @xmath219 ) . as , however , the ingoing packet moves from left to right in fig.[setup ] , its center crosses the target at the time @xmath210 .",
    "afterwards , the ingoing wave emerges from the right side of the target , and its support lies nearly completely in the semi - plane @xmath220 . at a still longer time ( @xmath195 ) , the center of the outgoing wavepacket has traveled a distance @xmath221 apart , and there is no longer any overlapping between the ingoing and outgoing wavepackets . as observed in fig.[septor]a , a transition takes place at some time between @xmath222 and @xmath223 , such that , before the transition , the separator is formed by a a pair of open curves on either side of the axis @xmath224 , while after the transition there is only one closed curve intersecting twice the axis @xmath224 both for @xmath220 and @xmath225 . taking into account the cylindrical symmetry around the z - axis ,",
    "the form of the separator in space before the transition is a cylindrical - like surface of rotation , while after the transition it becomes a prolate spheroidal - like surface .",
    "in fact , this time - changing surface marks a sharp limit between the domains of prevalence of the axial ingoing flow and the radial outgoing flow , as shown in fig.[septor]b for the time @xmath208 .    if eq.([septimel ] ) is supplemented by an equation for the phases of the ingoing and outgoing waves , which , for @xmath226 takes the form @xmath227 a simultaneous solution of eqs.([septimel ] ) and ( [ phaseop ] ) defines the set of all points of the configuration space where the total wavefunction ( eq.([psiinout ] ) ) becomes equal to zero .",
    "such points are called ` nodal points ' .    around the nodal points , the quantum flow forms _ quantum vortices _",
    "( figure [ vortex ] ) .",
    "the local form of the quantum currents in a vortex domain is very different from the general flow shown in fig.[septor ] .",
    "if we ` freeze ' the time @xmath12 , the instantaneous pattern formed by the vector field of quantum probability current @xmath228 corresponds to a characteristic structure called _ quantum vortex _ , or _",
    "nodal point - x - point complex _ @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "that is , close to a nodal point we find a second critical point of the flow , where one has @xmath229 .",
    "this is called an ` x - point ' , since it can be shown that it is always simply unstable , i.e. there are two real eigenvalues of the matrix of the linearized flow around x , which are one positive and one negative .",
    "accordingly , there are two opposite branches of unstable ( u , u ) and stable ( s , s ) manifolds emanating from x. on the other hand , the nodal point can be an attractor , center , or repellor .",
    "this determines the local form of the invariant manifolds u and s. it has been established theoretically @xcite that , except for a set of very small measure , most quantum trajectories _",
    "avoid _ the nodal point , being instead scattered along the asymptotic directions of the manifolds of the x - point , leading to large distances from the nodal point - x - point complex .",
    "furthermore , while , in general , the motion of the nodal point - x - point complexes introduces chaos ( @xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite ) , in the present problem this effect is negligible because i ) the speed of vortices is extremely small ( of order @xmath230 ) , and ii ) the quantum trajectories exhibit only a small number of encounters with nodal point - x - point complexes , as will be shown with numerical examples below . in conclusion",
    ", the effect of the nodal point - x - point complexes on the trajectories can be described as a scattering process without recurrences .    for the model parameters used in fig.[vortex ] ,",
    "the size of the quantum vortex , estimated by the distance @xmath231 from the nodal point to the x - point , is of the order of @xmath232 m .",
    "the size of vortices in the present model is in fact time dependent .",
    "however , in the time interval @xmath233 when there is essential overlapping of the ingoing and outgoing wavefunction terms , @xmath231 is approximately constant and it is given by the same estimate as in the second of the equations ( 25 ) of ref.@xcite , namely @xmath234 the above estimate is obtained by expanding the wavefunction around a nodal point up to terms of second degree in @xmath235 and @xmath236 , where @xmath237 are the coordinates of the nodal point , and by applying general formulae derived in @xcite regarding the dependence of @xmath231 on the coefficients of this local expansion .      .",

    "the determination of these loci follows by approximating all the quantum trajectories as _ piecewise straight lines_. namely , from fig.[orbitsl ] , it is evident that any trajectory can be considered as a nearly perfect horizontal line up to the point ( in space and time ) where the trajectory encounters the separator .",

    "the effect of this deformation on the bohmian trajectories is analogous to the one described in @xcite .",
    "namely , this deformation results in the formation of local _ channels of radial flow _ ,",

    "this distribution exhibit clear peaks at all the angles @xmath315 ( the first local maximum around @xmath316 is not due to a concentration at a bragg angle , but it is only caused by the trajectories moving nearly horizontally , i.e. within the support of the ingoing wavepacket ) .",
    "we note that plots of the quantum trajectories in a different scattering problem ( atom surface scattering ) , appearing in @xcite@xcite , show a similar qualitative picture as in fig.[diforb]b , a fact which was identified in that case too as a dynamical effect of the quantum vortices .",
    "we may thus conjecture that the quantum vortices play an important role in a wide context of different quantum - mechanical diffraction problems .",
    "finally , it should be stressed that the modification of the outgoing wavefunction according to eq.([psioutfinal ] ) only influences the bohmian velocity field in the transverse direction , while the radial flow of all bohmian trajectories ( as in fig.[diforb ] ) takes place at a constant speed @xmath317 .",
    "thus , the emergence of a diffraction pattern does not influence estimates on times of arrival or the times of flight of the particles to detectors placed at the same distance from the center , independently of the angle @xmath88 .",
    "this subject is now discussed in section 4 .",
    "an important practical utility of the quantum trajectory approach regards the possibility to unambiguously determine the probability distributions of the so - called _ arrival times _ , or of the _ times of flight _ of the scattered particles .",
    "this question is of particular interest , because it is related to the well known ` problem of time ' in quantum theory ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "this problem stems from a theorem of pauli @xcite , according to which it is not possible to properly define a self - adjoint time operator consistent with all axioms of quantum mechanics .",
    "this implies that the usual ( copenhagen ) formalism based on state vectors or density matrices is not applicable to a quantum - theoretical calculation of probabilities related to time observables .",
    "in fact , in both schrdinger s and heisenberg s pictures , time is considered only as a parameter of the quantum equations of motion .    among various proposals in the literature aiming to remedy this gap of standard quantum theory ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the bohmian formalism offers a straightforward solution .",
    "this is in principle subject to experimental testing , as will be proposed below .",
    "furthermore , as was mentioned in the introduction , the use of a wavepacket approach allows for a comparison of the bohmian approach with two other main approaches to the same subject , namely the ` history approach ' ( based on feynman paths ) @xcite@xcite , and the kijowski approach , based on so - called  bohm - aharonov operators @xcite .",
    "we should emphasize , however , that so far in the literature the latter approaches were given a consistent formulation only in the case of asymptotically free wavepacket motion @xcite , while their implementation in the case of scattered wavepackets is an open issue .",
    "this will be discussed in a future work . in the present paper , on the other hand ,",
    "we focus on results regarding the time observables as defined in the bohmian approach , and only provide a rough comparison of what should be expected by other theories of time observables .",
    "any definition of a time observable in quantum mechanics ( and also in classical physics ) requires the occurrence of two events serving as the ` start ' and the ` stop ' event in the process of timing .    in the definition of the _ arrival times _ of particles to detectors , we take as start event the preparation of the whole initial wavefunction at a certain moment @xmath318 , which can be conveniently set equal to @xmath217 . the stop event is the detection of the particle at a time @xmath319 .",
    "the arrival time of the particle to the detector is @xmath320 .",
    "the above definition of arrival times is independent of the adopted picture of quantum mechanics , since its only requirement is to assume that the preparation of an initial quantum state can be controllable in time ( see @xcite ) , i.e. that replicas of the same state can be prepared at any given time @xmath321 ( a technique realizing this experimentally will be proposed below ) .",
    "however , a consistent calculation of the arrival time probabilities by the various pictures is still an open theoretical issue ( see @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , the definition of a _ time of flight _ for a particle depends on the adopted picture of quantum mechanics , since it requires the use of some notion of _ spacetime paths _ that the particles presumably follow within the picture s framework .",
    "in fact , the time of flight is defined as the time elapsing between the crossing by the particle of two surfaces @xmath322 and @xmath323 in the configuration space .",
    "thus , this time is different from the arrival time , and the difference depends on where exactly the particle lies within the support of the initial wavefunction .    in the case of particle diffraction , it is convenient to choose the two surfaces as shown in fig.[setup ] : @xmath322 is taken normal to the z - axis at a point @xmath324 , while @xmath323 is a spherical surface surrounding the target at the radial distance @xmath325 .",
    "the time of flight @xmath326 depends on the scattering angle @xmath88 , and the quantity of interest is the difference @xmath327 for two angles @xmath328 , @xmath329 .",
    "this difference is independent of @xmath330 , provided that @xmath330 is such that both @xmath322 and @xmath323 are sufficiently far from the target .",
    "we now discuss separately the arrival time and the time - of - flight probabilities in the setup of fig.[setup ] .",
    "the motion of all scattered particles ( like in fig.[orbitsl ] ) in the domain beyond a sphere of radius @xmath331 around the center can be considered as a radially outward motion with constant speed , since , by taking @xmath332 ( where @xmath82 is given by eq.([psiout ] ) ) , the bohmian equations of motion in spherical coordinates read @xmath333 , @xmath334 .",
    "the last equation is modified when the diffraction terms in @xmath111 are taken into account .",
    "this modification , however , does not influence the motions in the radial direction , which , as shown now , are the only ones affecting the distribution of arrival times to a detector placed at a distance @xmath335 and at any fixed angle @xmath88 . by definition ,",
    "the latter distribution is given by @xmath336 where @xmath337 denotes the number of particles within the ( assumed fixed ) detector conic aperture @xmath338 around the angle @xmath88 arriving to the detector between the times @xmath12 and @xmath339 .",
    "since in the bohmian approach all the particles move with constant speed , we have @xmath340 in the case @xmath132 , substituting eq.([psioutl2 ] ) and making the usual approximations @xmath341 , @xmath342 results in @xmath343 where @xmath344 is a normalization constant . on the other hand , in the case @xmath145 ( via eq.([isefflim ] ) we find @xmath345 the main result can be summarized as follows : in either case @xmath176 or @xmath170 , the arrival time distribution is a localized distribution ( gaussian , around the mean time @xmath346 ) , whose dispersion is always of the order of _",
    "@xmath348 the maximum of the transverse and longitudinal coherence lengths_.    the latter property implies that the trajectory approach makes predictions regarding the arrival time distribution which depend on two main beam parameters , and are thus testable in principle by concrete experimental setups .",
    "one possible proposal in this direction is the use of the so - called _ laser - induced cold field emission technique _",
    "( see @xcite ) . in this technique , a cold - field electron source ( nanotip )",
    "is exposed to well separated in time focused weak laser pulses of time width @xmath349@xmath350fs .",
    "the photo - emitted electrons are accelerated towards the anode , whereby their initial state can be effectively described by an ingoing wavefunction of the form ( [ psiin ] ) .",
    "the scattered particles pass through detector placed at fixed angles @xmath88 as indicated in fig.[setup ] .",
    "the key point to notice is that time measurements in such a setup conform with the definition of the _ arrival times _ , since a detection of the triggering laser pulse can serve as a start event marking the initial time when the _ whole state _",
    "@xmath351 was prepared , while a later detection of a scattered particle serves as the stop time @xmath352 .",
    "we propose that by monitoring the electron beam one can achieve different values of @xmath78 and @xmath22 , thus probing quantitatively the predictions for @xmath353 as given by the quantum trajectory approach .",
    "the total time of flight from a point on @xmath322 to a point on @xmath323 is a function of the initial conditions @xmath267 . using the information from the swarm of numerical bohmian trajectories of fig.[orbitsl ] ,",
    "this function can also be quadratically interpolated by the numerical data on grid points .",
    "the mean time @xmath326 for all initial conditions leading to the same @xmath88 is then found numerically . since the choice of surfaces @xmath322 and @xmath323 in fig.[setup ] is arbitrary , the invariant quantity of interest is the difference @xmath354 , where @xmath355 is a fixed reference angle .",
    "figure [ timeavanglel ] shows this difference for the numerical trajectories of fig.[orbitsl]a .",
    "( see text ) for the bohmian trajectories of fig.[orbitsl ] .",
    "the smooth solid curve is the theoretical prediction of eq.([dtth2 ] ) while the dots represent numerical results . ]    due to eq.([dtth2 ] ) , the time difference @xmath366 has an @xmath367 dependence on @xmath88 .",
    "in fact , it is noticeable that eq.([dtth2 ] ) , which gives the difference of the mean times of flight in the wavepacket approach , turns to be identical to the estimate of @xcite ( their eq.(26 ) ) , referring to the plane wave approximation .",
    "this is expected , since the plane wave approximation can be considered as a limiting case of the wavepacket approach with @xmath176 , corresponding to the limit @xmath368 .",
    "one more interesting remark concerning the times of flight found by the bohmian approach is that the difference @xmath366 predicted in eq.([dtth2 ] ) has a completely different behavior from analogous quantities calculated in the framework of other theories of quantum time observables .",
    "while we defer a detailed reference to this problem to a future work , here we give some rough estimates concerning the sum - over - histories and the kijowski approaches referred to in the introduction .",
    "we find @xmath369 and @xmath370 an outline of the derivation of these formulae is given in appendix i.    a comparison of all three approaches yields that ( i ) the sum - over - histories approach ( which , using a semiclassical approximation yields essentially the same result as in classical scattering theory ) , predicts a mean time difference depending on the particle velocity @xmath2 , by the scaling law @xmath371[10 ^ 8\\mbox{m sec}^{-1}/v_0]^3\\cdot 10^{-19}sec$ ] .",

    "the scaling @xmath372 [ 10 ^ 8\\mbox{m sec}^{-1}/v_0]10^{-13}$]sec holds .    as a final conclusion",
    ", we propose that experiments aiming to measure time observables in setups of particle diffraction may provide new insight into fundamental problems such as the role of time in quantum mechanics .",
    "in particular , the predictions of the de broglie bohm theory are within the possibilities of present day experimental techniques .",
    "so far we have considered charged particles with quantum coherence lengths much larger than the distance between nearest neighbors in the target . however , this study does not cover the so - called short wavelength limit , as e.g. in the case of @xmath25particle or ion scattering . in this case",
    ", the quantum coherence length becomes comparable to or smaller than the distance between nearest neighbors in the target . as a result ,",
    "such particles ` see ' each of the atoms in the target as an individual scattering center and they do not interact with the target lattice as a whole . furthermore ,",
    "both @xmath22 and @xmath78 become comparable to a classical ` impact parameter ' @xmath373 ( of the order of a few fermi ) which is relevant to the classical description of rutherford scattering .",
    "the incorporation of @xmath373 in the wavefunction model can be done essentially as described in @xcite , assuming a gaussian form of his wavepacket , referred to by the notation @xmath374 , and aligning his vector denoted by @xmath375 along the x - axis of our coordinate system we have : @xmath376 with @xmath377 and @xmath378 after the calculation of the above gaussian integrals we are led to the following wavefunction model : @xmath379 where @xmath380 @xmath381 where @xmath382 is a nearly constant quantity , not affecting the bohmian trajectories , and @xmath95 .",
    "the time @xmath246 in the above formulae is taken so that , in the absence of scattering , the center of the ingoing wavepacket crosses the plane @xmath383 at the moment @xmath246 . furthermore , we consider the bohmian trajectories at positive or negative times satisfying @xmath384 , i.e. smaller than the decoherence time of the packet .    the outgoing term is modulated by the gaussian factor @xmath385 this factor implies that a replica of the ingoing wavepacket propagates from the center outwards as a spherical wavefront of the outgoing wave , albeit by a phase difference @xmath386 with respect to the ingoing wavepacket .",

    "all three trajectories are initially posed at the centers of their corresponding guiding wavepackets . ]    a careful inspection of eqs.([psiingse ] ) and ( [ psioutse ] ) shows that the spherical wavefront emanating from @xmath394 encounters the ingoing wavepacket at a time @xmath395 which _ decreases as @xmath373 decreases_. as a result , the bohmian trajectories , which are forced to follow the motion of the radial wavefront after the collision , are scattered to angles which are larger on the average for smaller @xmath373 .",
    "thus , the bohmian trajectories recover on the average the behavior of the classical rutherford trajectories .",
    "an example of this behavior is given in fig.[ruth ] , showing three bohmian trajectories corresponding to an initial condition taken at the center of the wavepacket defined by eq.([psiingse ] ) at the time @xmath396 , ensuring that the packet s spreading does not change appreciably in time up to the moment of collision with the outgoing wavefront .",
    "the three bohmian trajectories _ cross each other _ , yielding a larger scattering angle for a smaller initial distance from the z - axis , i.e. they are close to the familiar classical picture .",
    "it should be noted , however , that this closeness is only in an average sense , since the exact form of a bohmian trajectory guided by a wavepacket depends on where exactly the initial condition of the trajectory lies with respect to the center of mass of the initial packet .",
    "in fact , for _ one fixed value of b _ one obtains a swarm of de broglie - bohm trajectories ( with initial conditions around this value of @xmath373 ) .",
    "these trajectories are scattered in various directions and they do not cross each other , while they can define ( in a statistical sense ) a most probable scattering angle . however",
    ", this angle increases as @xmath373 decreases .",
    "hence , we conclude that when we consider the ` semiclassical limit ' of small wavelengths as well as small quantum coherence lengths , the bohmian trajectories yield results which agree on the average with the classical theory of rutherford scattering .",
    "we developed a wavefuntion model providing a wavepacket approach to the phenomenon of charged particle diffraction from thin material targets , and we employed the method of the de broglie - bohm quantum trajectories in order to interpret the emergence of diffraction patterns as well as to calculate arrival time probabilities for scattered particles detected at various scattering angles @xmath88 .",
