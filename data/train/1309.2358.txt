    "these systems are advantageous because of their long decoherence times , precise spin - state quantum control and high - fidelity readout .",
    "but most experiments have not yet reached system sizes where they are superior to conventional digital computer calculations ( for example , linear paul trap experiments have worked with as many as 16 spins  @xcite in a one - dimensional linear crystal ) . however , using a penning trap , researchers at nist in boulder , co have created systems of @xmath1300 spins in a single - plane two - dimensional crystal and have demonstrated the use of a spin - dependent optical dipole force to realize tunable ising - type spin - spin couplings , an important first step in the simulation of quantum magnetism in systems intractable by conventional computers  @xcite .",
    "one complication to the nist experiment is the accumulation of impurities in the crystal during the experimental procedure .",
    "hydrogen molecules and water molecules in the background gas collide with the beryllium ions in the crystal and form a variety of impurities  @xcite , the most common being beh@xmath0 ions or beoh@xmath0 ions ( h@xmath0 ions can also form as defects if the electron impact ionization electrons have too high an energy or the system is at too high a temperature , but when that happens the crystal is usually reloaded , so we neglect them ) . in this article , we generalize previous work for the normal modes in a penning trap  @xcite to include these types of defects . in our numerical calculations , we focus solely on the beh@xmath0 defects ( which are the most commonly seen defect ) , although the generalization to other defects is a straightforward and simple task . because these defects are more massive than the be@xmath0 ions , they are centrifugally driven to the boundary of the planar array .",
    "we determine how these defects affect the eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors of the normal modes , and investigate how these changes affect the spin - spin interactions when detuning the optical dipole force to the blue of the axial center - of - mass mode .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we generalize the theory for the normal modes of cold ions in a penning trap to include the presence of impurities . in sec .",
    "iii , we provide representative numerical examples to illustrate how beh@xmath0 defects modify the phonon frequencies and the spin - spin interactions . in sec .",

    "is applied to the ions through ring electrodes so that the steady state of the ions ( with a rigid body rotational speed @xmath8 can be phase locked . note that the rotating quadrupole potential is well implemented by ring electrodes with just six sectors ( as employed in the nist penning traps  @xcite).,title=\"fig : \" ] +",

    "iii , we will show numerical results for the eigenvalue problem , but here we want to mention one important fact .",
    "when we have a pure system , all of the masses are identical , and one can immediately show that the center - of - mass mode involves an identical axial displacement of all of the ions , and hence it has a frequency equal to @xmath70 .",
    "as defects are added into the system , the center - of - mass mode changes , with the heavier mass objects moving with a smaller amplitude .",
    "this then reduces the frequency of the mode , which is one of the simplest ways to determine that the crystal has defects ( in fact , by tracking the discrete changes of this mode frequency , one can determine the precise number of defects at any given instant of time ) .",

    "the axial displacement is then represented as an operator in the following two equivalent forms : @xmath80    finally , we need to derive the effective spin - spin interactions that arise when an optical dipole force is applied to the system in the axial direction .",
    "the analysis is identical to that given before  @xcite , with the mass replaced by the average mass , due to the form of the expansion of the coordinate in terms of the phonon raising and lowering operators and the @xmath81 generalized eigenvectors .",

    "the symbol @xmath85 is also referred to as the detuning of the optical dipole force from the phonon modes , since the crystal is resonantly driven when the beatnote frequency ( or detuning ) is equal to a normal mode frequency @xmath86 .",
    "of course , the spin - spin interactions only hold between the pure atomic species , since the energy levels and matrix elements change for the defect sites , so the sites @xmath17 and @xmath82 must both be sites without defects , in order for there to be a spin - spin interaction generated by the optical dipole force .",

    "next , we define the real orthonormal eigenvectors @xmath120 to satisfy @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the normal mode frequency for motion in a vanishing effective magnetic field .",
    "then , we form the matrix @xmath123 from the column vectors @xmath124 and we evaluate the quadratic eigenvalue problem in the basis of the eigenvectors of @xmath124 by multiplying on the left by @xmath125 and inserting @xmath126 before the vector @xmath127 .",

    "since these matrices are in the basis of the eigenvectors of @xmath132 , they use the eigenvector index @xmath72 for the components of the stiffness matrix , which is diagonal , of course .",
    "in addition , using the orthonormality of the @xmath133 eigenvectors , one immediately sees that @xmath134 .",
    "the eigenvalues of the quadratic eigenvalue problem are all real , and by taking the complex conjugate of eq .",
    "( [ eq : quad_plane ] ) , it is easy to see that if @xmath92 is the eigenvalue corresponding to the eigenvector @xmath135 then @xmath98 is the eigenvalue corresponding to @xmath136 . since the solution of a nontrivial quadratic eigenvalue problem is not obvious , we map it onto a conventional eigenvalue problem , by doubling the size of the matrices .",
    "we do so in a symmetrized fashion , so that the resulting matrix is hermitian ( but complex ) , and the solution of the eigenvalue problem follows conventional linear algebra techniques .",

    "it is straightforward to show that the solution of this linear eigenvalue problem solves the original quadratic eigenvalue problem .",
    "we organize the solutions so that the first @xmath91 eigenvalues are positive and the second @xmath91 eigenvalues are negative . since the negative eigenvectors of the quadratic eigenvalue problem are related to the positive eigenvectors via complex conjugation , we automatically know the negative eigenvectors once the positives are known . note that working in the @xmath139 basis produces a diagonal form for the spring - constant matrix , which allows us to easily take the matrix square root .",
    "the eigenvectors of the linear eigenvalue problem ( of dimension @xmath140 ) satisfy the conventional orthogonality and completeness relations of hermitian eigenvalue problems , but we choose them not to be normalized , so that we can find more standard relations between the @xmath135 eigenvectors . following the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite , one can derive the following relations based on orthogonality and completeness : @xmath141 in the last three of these expressions , the second terms in the parenthesis arise from the negative eigenvalue solutions of the quadratic eigenvalue problem .",

    "the complications arise because the generalized momentum operators do not commute with each other due to the magnetic field . the procedure to properly quantize the hamiltonian is still fairly standard , and we present only a sketch of the full derivation here .",

    "the corresponding generalized momentum is @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the antisymmetric matrix that represents the effective magnetic field in the basis of the @xmath133 eigenvectors , as described above .",
    "the classical hamiltonian now takes a simple form in terms of the mechanical momentum and the generalized coordinate : @xmath148",
    "the problem with quantization is that we quantize with respect to the generalized momentum , not the mechanical momentum , so the mechanical momentum commutation relation becomes nonzero between different spatial directions .",

    "since there are a number of different ways that one might invoke an effective spin - spin coupling that employs driving the planar phonon modes , but none have been implemented experimentally yet , we do not examine effective spin - spin interactions in the planar directions any further in this work .",
    "of course , it would be a straightforward procedure to go from the quantized phonons to the spin - spin interactions when a spin - dependent force is applied , and this can be done in the future if it is needed for the case with defects in the ion crystal .",

    "[ eqpos ] , we plot the equilibrium positions of the ions when the system has a number of defects added for the two different rotation rates for the rotating wall potential .",
    "one is a faster rotation rate , which tends to have closer - packed circular shaped crystals and the other is a slower rotation , having a much larger sized crystal , with a marked oval asymmetry .",
    "note how , in the circular case , the defects occupy the outer ring of the structure , while in the oval case , they are pushed primarily to the tips of the oval .",
    "note how the spatial scale is three times larger in the bottom row ( oval case ) .",
    "in general , while the equilibrium positions are certainly changed when defects are added , the change is not too large , and affects primarily the defect sites .",
    "there are three branches of phonon modes .",
    "the planar modes are described by the low - energy magnetron modes and the high energy cyclotron modes .",
    "the magnetron mode eigenvalues are hardly changed by the presence of defects , so we do not replot their values here .",
    "the cyclotron modes have very little dispersion , and they are centered around the different cyclotron frequencies , hence @xmath31 of the eigenvalues are near @xmath177 , and @xmath178 eigenvalues are near @xmath179 .",

    "the axial eigenvalues are plotted in fig .",
    "[ axial ] for the pure case and the case with @xmath180 defects .",
    "all modes clearly show an overall suppression of the phonon frequencies , while approximately @xmath31 of the modes are being suppressed by a larger amount ( on the order of 3% ) , which might be expected due to the mass difference .",
    "what is perhaps more surprising is that the @xmath31 modes that are suppressed more than the average ones occur at different regions of the spectrum when the shape of the equilibrium crystal changes . in the circular case ,",
    "they lie near the top of the spectrum and in the oval case near the bottom .",
    "the most probable explanation is that the isolated clustering of the defects in the oval case lends that system to have more localized modes that primarily involve the motion of defects only or of be@xmath0 ions only , which then shifts the lower energy frequencies due to the defects since the center - of - mass mode is the highest frequency mode for the axial phonons .",
    "this effect is much reduced for the more circular crystals , where the defects are more evenly positioned around the perimeter of the crystal and the crystal is more homogeneous and closely packed , so that the largest change is for the collective modes that involve the motion of all ions and lie near the top of the spectrum .",

    "in fig .  [",
    "fig : lin_comb ] , we can see some cases of this behavior . in the top panel ,",
    "we show how one of the modes for the defect case for fast rotation , is almost exactly related to a linear combination of two nearby modes in the pure system , while for the defect case for slow rotation , in the lower panel , we can see that one of the defect modes is ( roughly ) related to a linear combination of two nearby pure modes .",
    "the fact that different phonon modes in the pure case are approximately combined into new modes for the defect case can be studied more quantitatively by determining the overlap of the defect eigenvectors onto the eigenvectors for the pure case .",
    "this is done computing the normalized ( @xmath133 ) eigenvectors for the relative displacements of the pure system , taking the dot product with the defect case eigenvectors and taking the absolute value .",
    "we use the @xmath133 eigenmodes because they form two orthonormal sets of vectors , so the expression is @xmath181 we plot these results as a function of the mode numbers ( sorted according to increasing phonon frequency ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : mode ] with a false color image .",
    "the fact that the results for the circular case ( top ) lie predominantly on the diagonal indicates that the character of the modes does not change so much as the defects are added , but the effect becomes more severe near the higher modes , and this is precisely where the phonon frequencies were changed the most in the system .",
    "for the oval case ( bottom ) , we see two high weight tracks and significant more spread amongst the results .",
    "this indicates that the defects are having a much more significant effect on the eigenvectors , but the second track on the subdiagonal indicates that the main effect is a reordering of the numbers of the modes , arising primarily from the phonons being more localized on the defect free and defect regions separately . in the right panels , we project the motion of the eigenvectors for the pure case onto the positions of the defects .",
    "this is done by first determining the @xmath180 positions for the equilibrium configuration that are farthest from the origin .",
    "we project the pure case eigenvector onto those defect sites , and compute the norm of the projected vector .",
    "this norm is called the projection of the pure eigenmode onto the defect sites and is plotted in the right panels .",
    "one can see that there are far more modes with projections onto the defect sites for the oval case than for the circular case , and this explains why the eigenmodes have more mixing of the pure case modes in the oval case .",
    "modes with little mixing on the defect sites will not have their frequencies changed by too much .",
    "these tend to be the low mode number localized modes of the axial eigenvectors .    ) with 36 defects ( left ) and norm of the pure - case eigenmode restricted to the defect sites ( right ) .",
    "two cases are shown : ( i ) fast rotation ( circular ) case on the top and ( ii ) slow rotation ( oval case ) on the bottom . ]",
    "we next show how the center - of - mass mode changes with the number of defects for the two cases of fast and slow rotation in fig .",
    "[ fig : com_defect ] .",
    "these curves are fairly linear , although structures in them can be clearly seen , the slopes depend strongly on the shape of the crystal , being much smaller for the oval case .",
    "the relative shift of the frequency is small because the mass difference is only on the order of 10% between the pure and defect sites .",
    "we end this subsection by plotting some properties of the cyclotron planar modes in fig .",
    "[ fig : cyclotron ] . panels ( a ) and ( b ) show two selected modes of motion .",
    "one can see that these modes are separated into motion of the defects only or motion of the be@xmath0 ions only , with very little coherent motion between the two species .",
    "this occurs because the cyclotron motions of the two species are so different , much more so than the dispersion of the modes , and hence there is little collective motion between the two species .",
    "example movies of these phonon modes are shown in the supplemental materials  @xcite .     and the fast rotating case ; arrows indicate the instantaneous motion of the respective ionic site .",
    "one can see in panels ( a ) and ( b ) that the cyclotron modes separate into motion of the defects only ( a ) or of the be@xmath0 only ( b ) . the mode spectrum is shown in panel ( c ) , where one can clearly see the separation of the motion according to the two different cyclotron frequencies for the defect case . ]",
    "+ -0.2 in        now that we have described how defects alter the phonon properties , we investigate how the spin - spin interactions compare to the pure case . by coupling the phonons to the spins with a spin - dependent optical force , one can generate an ising hamiltonian ( @xmath182 is the pauli spin matrix in the @xmath183-direction at site @xmath110 ) @xmath184 where we have neglected time - dependent terms , and the sum is only over pure sites where a be@xmath0 ion lies .",
    "this is because as defects are added to the system , those sites no longer have an addressable spin , and hence we only compute the spin - spin interactions between two sites that each contain a be@xmath0 ion .",
    "hence the spin - spin couplings become @xmath185 for @xmath110 and @xmath17 be@xmath0 sites only .",
    "to be specific , we examine detuning to the blue of the center - of - mass mode , correcting the detuning to lie to the blue of the center - of - mass mode with the defects .",
    "this way , all of the results will be compared on an equal footing .",
    "since the spin - spin couplings should behave like a power law in the distance between the ions , we fit the tails of the distributions to power laws . the full range of the power law behavior ranges from 0 to 3 , but because the center - of - mass mode is nonuniform when defects are present , the power law wo nt extend all the way down to zero .",
    "+ -0.2 in      results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jij ] for the faster rotating circular crystal .",
    "one can immediately see that the main effect of the defects is to slightly increase the power law for an equivalent detuning , and for there to be a larger spread to the data as a function of distance when there are more defects .",
    "in particular , when there are enough defects , it is difficult to get to the point where the power law approaches zero .",
    "these results are quite important for experiment , as they show that the defects do not significantly alter the behavior of the spin - spin interactions , hence one does not need to maintain perfect purity when running a given experiment .",
    "the only issue that arises is one needs to ensure the detuning remains fixed relative to the center of mass mode , by keeping the number @xmath186 constant during the experiment [ @xmath187 , which does require carefully monitoring the center - of - mass mode frequency . not doing so , will give rise to a somewhat larger drift of the power laws as more defects are added to the crystal .",
    "the situation is a bit different for the slower rotating oval crystal , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : jij_oval ] . here ,",
    "as the number of defects rises , we see two effects .",
    "the first is an overall broadening of the width of the distribution of the couplings , especially for cases where the detuning is close to the center - of - mass mode , and we also see a long distance deviation of the power law behavior ( also most pronounced for small detunings ) . these effects become worse as the number of defects rises , and must be due to the change in character of the phonon modes near the boundary region between the pure ions and the defects .",
    "hence , the aspect ratio of the crystal plays a role in how well the spin - spin couplings are maintained as defects are added to the system , and as we expect , the problems are worse for close detuning to the center - of - mass mode .",
    "in this work we have developed a general theory and formalism to describe the phonon modes of a single - plane rotating coulomb crystal in a penning trap , and used those phonon modes to determine the relevant spin - spin couplings of the system .",
    "we find that , in general , the effects of the defects are rather mild even when they result in more than 15% of the lattice sites in the crystal .",
    "the biggest effect is in modifying the character of some of the phonon modes , in a well - determined fashion .",
    "even so , the effect on the effective spin hamiltonian generated by a spin - dependent optical force applied to the crystal , is rather small , especially if the relative detuning @xmath186 is held constant during the experiment and the crystal is nearly circular . these results clearly indicate that penning trap quantum simulators are robust to the introduction of a number of defects into the system , and hence one need not control the purity to high levels in order to use them as quantum emulators . but deviations are more important for certain shape crystals , implying that one should go through this type of analysis to ensure that the experiments remain robust against the effects of the defects .",
