    "multiple ionization of atoms by single photon absorption is a process of great interest since it probes the correlated motion of many electrons .",
    "quadruple photoionization of the ground state of beryllium is the most fundamental atomic process involving four bound electrons .",
    "no other theoretical or experimental study is , to our knowledge , currently available regarding escape of four initially bound electrons .",
    "the ionization processes involving two electron escape can now be treated quite accurately and significant progress has been made concerning their understanding @xcite .",
    "regarding the three electron escape by single photon absorption from the ground state of li , significant advances have been made over the last few years in obtaining total triple ionization cross sections both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "however , still great challenges remain , particularly concerning differential cross sections @xcite .",
    "triple ionization of the ground state of li by electron impact , that is , a four electron escape process , has been addressed in very recent years .",
    "these experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies address very high energies of the impacting electron .",
    "our construction of the initial phase space density @xmath0 for the quadruple photoionization of beryllium is similar to the double photoionization of he @xcite and the triple photoionization formulation of li which has been detailed in @xcite .",
    "we formulate the quadruple photoionization process from the be ground state ( @xmath1 ) as a two step process in the following way : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the total photoabsorption cross section and @xmath4 is the probability for quadruple ionization .",
    "for @xmath3 we use the experimental data from ref @xcite .",
    "our formulation accounts for the second step .",
    "first , one electron absorbs the photon ( photo - electron ) at time @xmath5 . through electronic correlations ,",
    "the energy is redistributed , resulting in four electrons escaping to the continuum .",
    "we first assume that the photon is absorbed by a @xmath6-electron at the nucleus ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "this latter approximation becomes exact in the limit of high photon energy @xcite . for",
    "be , the cross section for photon absorption from a @xmath6 orbital is much larger than from a @xmath8 orbital @xcite .",
    "hence , we can safely assume that the photo - electron is a @xmath6 electron which significantly reduces the initial phase space to be sampled .",
    "we also neglect antisymmetrization of the electrons in the initial state .",
    "we denote the photo - electron by 1 , the other @xmath6 electron by 2 and the two @xmath8 electrons by 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "following photon absorption , we model the initial phase space distribution of the remaining three electrons , @xmath6 and two @xmath8 , by the wigner transform @xcite of the corresponding initial wavefunction @xmath9 , where @xmath10 are the electron vectors starting at the nucleus .",
    "we approximate the initial wavefunction as a simple product of hydrogenic orbitals @xmath11 with effective charges @xmath12 , to facilitate the wigner transformation .",
    "the @xmath12 are chosen so that they reproduce the known ionization potentials @xmath13 , namely for one of the two 2s electrons @xmath14 ( @xmath15a.u . ) , for the other 2s electron @xmath16 ( @xmath17 a.u . ) , and for the 1s electron @xmath18 ( @xmath19a.u.)(we use atomic units throughout the paper if not stated otherwise . ) the excess energy , @xmath20 , is given by @xmath21 with @xmath22 the photon energy and @xmath23 a.u .",
    "the be quadruple ionization threshold energy . given the above considerations , the initial phase space density is given by @xmath24 with normalization constant @xmath25 .",
    "we determine the quadruple ionization probability @xmath4 formally through @xmath26 the projector @xmath27 indicates that we integrate only over those parts of phase space that lead to quadruple ionization .",
    "@xmath28 is the classical liouville operator which is defined by the poisson bracket \\{h , } , with h the hamiltonian of the system . in our case h",
    "is the full coulomb five - body hamiltonian .",
    "we propagate the electron trajectories using the classical equations of motion ( classical trajectory monte carlo method @xcite ) . regularized coordinates @xcite",
    "are used to avoid problems with electron trajectories starting at the nucleus .",
    "we label as quadruply ionizing those trajectories where the energies of all four electrons are positive , @xmath29 with @xmath30 , asymptotically in time .",
    "in figure [ fig : prob ] , we present our results for @xmath4 .",
    "the very small value of the quadruple photoionization probability clearly shows the difficulties involved in obtaining theoretical results or experimental measurements of the five - body break - up process . using ( [ eq : cross ] ) we present in figure [ fig : cross ] the results for the quadruple photoabsorption cross section ( black circles ) . since there are no other results currently available we can not compare our results on an absolute scale .",
    "regarding the accuracy of our results , the standard relative error is @xmath31 @xcite with @xmath32 the number of quadruply ionizing events . for energies above 10 ev the @xmath32 we obtain are a few thousands rendering our results very accurate while for energies from 4ev up to and 9 ev , @xmath32 are at least 1000 .",
    "however , a comparison of our results with a shape function applicable to single - photon multiple ionization processes @xcite provides some indication of how well our results reproduce the shape of the total cross section .",
    "this shape function reproduces , by construction , the correct behavior of the single photon multiple - ionization cross section for excess energies close to threshold ( wannier law @xcite ) and for large excess energies .",
    "it depends on two parameters , the position @xmath33 and height @xmath34 of the cross section maximum and is given by : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the characteristic exponent in the wannier threshold law and @xmath37 is the excess energy @xmath20 scaled by @xmath33 . for the break up of a four electron atom this characteristic exponent was found to be 3.331 for a plane configuration where the electrons escape on the apexes of a square and 3.288 for a three dimensional configuration where the electrons escape on the apexes of a tetrahedron @xcite . from the above two values for @xmath36 it is the smallest one , @xmath38 , that dominates the threshold behavior and thus the value we use in the shape formula in ( [ eq : shape ] ) . using the shape formula without any fitting parameters but substituting for @xmath39 ev and @xmath40 b which are the location and height of the maximum cross section from our results we obtain the solid curve shown in figure [ fig : cross ] . given that there are no fitting parameters the agreement between our numerical results and the shape formula is quite good , providing support that the shape of the cross section we obtain is the correct one .",
    "the agreement becomes even better if instead we use the @xmath33 and @xmath34 as fitting parameters to fit our results with the shape formula .",
    "doing so , we obtain the values @xmath41 ev and @xmath42 b and the agreement of the fitted shape formula ( dashed curve in figure [ fig : cross ] ) with our results is indeed very good .    also , for small values of the excess energy we have fitted our results for the quadruple cross section with the formula @xmath43 with i the fragmentation threshold energy of beryllium and @xmath22 the photon energy . for energies from 4 ev to 9 ev",
    "our results yield a characteristic exponent @xmath36 of 3.17 which is quite close to the analytical value of 3.288 .",
    "the difference can probably be attributed to the fact that our current results go only down to 4 ev .",
    "it is a well known fact that as the energy increases the value of @xmath36 decreases @xcite .",
    "thus , most probably , if we were able to obtain results for energies below 4 ev @xmath36 would have been closer to the actual value of 3.288 . currently however the numerical difficulties involved in obtaining results below 4 ev are prohibitive .    at this point ,",
    "a few comments are in order .",
    "our quasiclassical formulation is most accurate close to threshold .",
    "it can describe the process accurately up to at most intermediate excess energies while it can not account for high energies . for high energies the process",
    "can only be described quantum mechanically . in the case of triple ionization from the ground state of li our simple product initial state",
    "has proven to be very good in describing not only the total cross section @xcite but also double energy differential cross sections up to excess energies of 220 ev , see @xcite , with @xmath44 ev for the triple escape process .",
    "how good the choice of a product initial state for the case of beryllium is remains to be seen when more theoretical and experimental results become available and a comparison with our results can be made for a range of excess energies .",
    "a comparison of the maximum of the single photoionization cross section for h , @xmath45 b , with the maxima for double photoionization of he , @xmath46 b @xcite , triple photoionization of li , @xmath47 b , and quadruple photoionization of be , 0.0847 b , clearly shows how rare the quadruple photoionization process is . for the double ionization cross section of he we use the results presented in ref @xcite",
    "while for the triple photoionization of li we use the results presented in ref @xcite .",
    "another , interesting feature is the relation between the ionization threshold energy and the photon energy @xmath48 where the maximum of the photoionization cross section of the respective process occurs .",
    "for the single photoionization of h , @xmath49 ev , for the double photoionization of he , @xmath50 ev @xcite , while for the triple and quadruple photoionization of li and be @xmath33 is respectively 52.7 ev and 134.4 ev .",
    "the values of 52.7 ev and 134.4 ev were found by fitting ( [ eq : shape ] ) to our results for triple @xcite and quadruple photoionization , respectively . in figure",
    "[ fig : threshold ] , we plot @xmath22 as a function of @xmath51 for the above four processes .",
    "interestingly , we find that for these four processes the ratio of @xmath22/@xmath51 is constant . whether there is a physical reason underlying",
    "this constant ratio is an interesting question for future research .",
    "a future study of interest for the four electron escape in be would be to investigate whether the collision processes the four electrons follow to escape to the continum can still be described as a sequence of three - body subsystems as is the case for li @xcite .",
    "another interesting aspect to be investigated is the shape of the inter - electronic angular distributions for energies close to threshold . in the case ,",
    "of the three electron escape from the ground state of li we found that in an energy regime where the characteristic exponent @xmath52 @xcite is recovered the angular distribution has a surprising t - shape distribution .",
    "this t - shape is different than what one would expect from the three electrons escaping in the apexes of an equilateral triangle for excess energy zero @xcite . at zero excess energy ,",
    "the four electrons escape in the apexes of a tetrahedron @xcite .",
    "it remains to be seen whether a surprising pattern will be found for the four electron escape as was the case for the three electrons .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have presented the first results for the total cross section for the quadruple photoionization of be . with no other theoretical or experimental results currently available",
    "we hope that the current results will serve as a benchmark calculation for future studies of the coulomb five - body problem .",
