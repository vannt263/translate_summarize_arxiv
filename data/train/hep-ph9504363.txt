    "in spite of the belief that quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the fundamental underlying theory of the strong interaction , low energy phenomena such as static properties of hadrons defy solutions based on qcd .",
    "the pertinacity of qcd in the low energy region have led to efforts to construct an effective theory for the strong interaction . in pursuit of this aim ,",
    "the chiral quark soliton model  also known as the semibosonized nambu - jona - lasinio(njl ) model  emerged as a successful effective theory to describe the low energy phenomena without loss of important properties of qcd such as chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking .",
    "originally , the idea of finding the soliton in a model with quarks coupled to pions was realized by kahana , ripka and soni  @xcite and banerjee and birse  @xcite .",
    "the bound states of the valence quarks were well explored in the model while it suffered from the vacuum instability  @xcite .",
    "this problem of the vacuum instability was solved by diakonov and petrov  @xcite .",
    "having investigated the instanton picture of the qcd vacuum in the low - momenta limit in ref .",
    "@xcite , they have shown that the low - momenta theory is equivalent to the quark - soliton model free from the vacuum instability .",
    "the model was further elaborated in ref .",
    "@xcite so that it could predict the static properties of the nucleon in the gradient approximation .",
    "the baryon in this model is regarded as @xmath1 valence quarks coupled to the polarized dirac sea bound by a non - trivial chiral field configuration in the hartree approximation  @xcite .",
    "the identification of the baryon quantum numbers is acquired by the semi - classical quantization  @xcite ( in nuclear physics called the cranking method  @xcite ) which is performed by integrating over the zero - mode fluctuations of the pion field around the saddle point .",
    "it makes the baryon carry proper quantum numbers like spins and isospins . in su(2 ) , the model enables us to describe quantitatively a great deal of static properties of the nucleon such as @xmath2@xmath3 splitting  @xcite , axial constants  @xcite , electromagnetic form factors  @xcite , and to some extent also magnetic moments  @xcite .",
    "although the su(2 ) version of the model was quite successful to explain many static properties of the nucleon , it is necessary to extend the model from su(2 ) to su(3 ) so that it can be possible to examine the same properties of hyperons and moreover to investigate the effects of hidden strangeness on the nucleon which are in particular manifested in the @xmath4 sigma term @xcite , the iso  splitting of the baryonic masses  @xcite and strange form factors  @xcite .",

    "@xcite have carried out the extension of the model from su(2 ) to su(3 ) .",
    "starting from the semibosonized njl - type lagrangian , they have shown that the model describes hyperon spectra successfully .",
    "the extended su(3 ) model is distinguished from the su(2 ) njl in two ways : firstly , the mixed terms of the pure su(2 ) part and and the strange vacuum part are induced by the trivial embedding of the su(2 ) soliton into su(3 ) .",
    "secondly , since the mass of the strange is not negligible , one has to take into account the mass term in the effective action explicitly .",
    "the mass corrections are treated perturbatively in linear order .",
    "it was shown that the perturbative treatment of the @xmath5 in the njl model describes the octet - decuplet mass splitting @xcite very well and plays an essential role in the mass splitting of hyperons .",
    "these two differences determine the characteristic of the su(3 ) njl model .",
    "@xcite indicate that the su(3 ) njl provides a more refined structure of the collective hamiltonian than the pseudoscalar skyrme model .",
    "a comparable structure can be obtained in the skyrme model only by introducing explicit vector mesons .",
    "however , it is inevitable to import large numbers of parameters into the skyrme model with vector meson , while the parameters in the njl model can be fixed completely by adjusting mesonic masses and decay constants ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) .",
    "the only free parameter we have is the constituent quark mass arising as a result of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry .",
    "this parameter is fixed by adjusting the mass splitting  @xcite properly .",
    "it is of great importance that @xmath0 rotational corrections are taken into account .",
    "starting from the path integral formalism , when we integrate over zero modes fluctuations around the saddle point , a time ordered product of collective operators appears .",
    "the @xmath0 contribution survives due to the noncommutivity of the collective operators @xcite .",
    "it was examined in detail in ref .",

    "it predicted the experimental data within about @xmath12 .    in recent papers ,",
    "we have proceeded to evaluate the magnetic moments  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic moments of the su(3 ) octet baryons predicted by the present model are in a remarkable agreement with the experiments .",
    "now , we are in a position to study the electromagnetic form factors and other form factors such as strange form factors .",
    "it is important to investigate the form factors in our model , since it allows us to take a step forward in studying dynamics .",
    "hence , as a first phase , we will consider the electromagnetic form factors .",
    "it is of great significance to know them in the su(3 ) njl in that not only they provide us with the electromagnetic informations but also they allow us to proceed to explore the techniques for the form factors of the neutral(@xmath13 ) currents and charged weak(@xmath14 ) currents .",
