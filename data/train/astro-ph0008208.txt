    "one - dimensional self - gravitating systems is a simplified model of gravitational many body system .",
    "the system represents the motion of parallel flat mass sheets interacting each other through newtonian gravity . since its equation of motion",
    "can be solved piecewise exactly during each interval between collisions , numerical integration of the system is particularly simple .",
    "hence the system is used to study long - time behavior and relaxation process of gravitational systems  @xcite .",
    "in addition , one - particle distribution for canonical and microcanonical ensemble is obtained  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : ygs-1 ] . anomaly in relaxation for small value of @xmath7 is also pointed out in  @xcite .",
    "we extend their study to the region @xmath8 and found that there is a new phase of evolution where a fractal spatial structure is spontaneously created .",
    "we would like to stress that the fractal structure is created even when the initial condition is not fractal ( typically uniformly random ) .",

    "the one - dimensional self - gravitating system ( also known as ` mass - sheet model ' ) consists of @xmath9 equivalent flat sheets of constant mass density .",
    "the sheets are infinitely extended in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 direction and are aligned parallel to each other and move in the @xmath12 direction .",

    "@xmath22 is called ` crossing time ' and is a typical time for a particle to traverse the system .    with this hamiltonian ,",
    "the equation of motion reads @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are number of sheets which are on the right and left of the sheet @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "( [ eq : eq - of - motion ] ) indicates that the force acting on each sheet is constant until a collision occurs between two sheets .",
    "hence we can exactly integrate the equation of motion  ( [ eq : eq - of - motion ] ) between every two collisions .",
