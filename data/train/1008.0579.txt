    ", lorentz violating sidereal variations of the larmor frequency of co - located spin polarized gases occur due to the rotation of the laboratory reference frame with respect to a relic background field . to search for this effect we measured the free spin precession larmor frequency @xmath3 of co - located @xmath0he and @xmath1xe in a homogenous magnetic field _",
    "b _ , where @xmath4 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the corresponding gas species . referring to the cramer - rao lower bound@xcite , the upper limit for the frequency sensitivity of such a damped sinusoidal signal with white gaussian noise is given by @xmath5 where _ snr _ is the signal - to - noise ratio , @xmath6 is the sampling rate @xmath7 limited bandwidth , and _",
    "t _ the observation time .",
    "@xmath8 describes the effect of exponential damping with the transverse spin relaxation time @xmath9 , whereby @xmath10 for observation times @xmath11 . in the regime of motional narrowing and at low magnetic fields ( @xmath12 t )",
    "the @xmath9 for polarized spin samples can be in the order of days@xcite .",
    "for a _ snr _ of 10000:1 in a bandwidth of 1 hz and @xmath13day , a sensitivity in frequency estimation of @xmath14phz can be reached@xcite .",
    "-1 pt our experiments were performed in the magnetically shielded room bmsr-2 at the ptb in berlin .",
    "its 7 layer @xmath15-metal shield preserves a low residual magnetic field of @xmath162nt and a field gradient around the sample cell @xmath160.3pt / cm .",
    "a homogenous magnetic guiding field of @xmath17400nt was provided by two square coil pairs arranged perpendicular to each other in order to manipulate the sample spins .",
    "the maximal field gradients were @xmath1733pt / cm . our sample cells were filled with a gas mixture of @xmath18he , @xmath1xe , and n@xmath19 , whereby n@xmath19 is needed as buffer gas for @xmath1xe@xcite .",
    "the cells were placed directly below the dewar that contains 300 lt@xmath20-squids which detect a sinusoidal _ b _ field change caused by the spin precession of the gas atoms .",
    "the recorded signal is a superposition of the @xmath0he and @xmath1xe precession signals which can be separated by applying , e.g. , a digital filter ( see fig .  [",
    "aba : signals ] ) .",
    "each signal is sinusoidally modulated and decays exponentially with its respective relaxation time @xmath21 .",
    "for practical reasons , we did not analyze the larmor frequency @xmath22 of @xmath0he and @xmath1xe , but its equivalent , the phase @xmath23 . in order to cancel the dependence on ambient magnetic field fluctuations",
    ", we analyzed the weighted phase difference of the co - located precessing spin ensembles , @xmath24 if there were no effects on the spin precession frequency , respectively the phase , the weighted phase difference @xmath25 is expected to be constant .",
    "figure [ aba : phases_residuals ] shows the time dependence of @xmath26 which is mainly dominated by a linear term . similar to the foucault pendulum , the rotation of the squids because of the earth s rotation with respect to the precessing spins causes a constant frequency shift @xmath27rad / s , and thus a linear term in the measured phase @xmath28 . if we subtract this linear term from the weighted phase difference , we get the corrected phase @xmath29 ( see fig .  [",
    "aba : phases_residuals ] ) . in march 2009 , we performed a measurement consisting of 7 long - term subruns in series , each with a duration of 10hours at least .",
    "for all subruns j , with @xmath30 , we determined the weighted phase difference @xmath31 and subtracted the phase shift @xmath32 in order to obtain @xmath33 .",
    "the latter one can be described by @xmath34 here , @xmath35 is the starting time of each subrun with respect to the first subrun , @xmath36 a phase offset , and @xmath37 a linear phase shift mainly arising from deviations of @xmath38 from their literature values due to chemical shifts .",
    "@xmath39 are the amplitudes of two exponential terms that reflect the respective phase shift due to coupled spin ensembles based on demagnetization fields in a non - ideally spherical cell .",
    "this phase shift is directly correlated to the decay of the signal amplitude of the precessing @xmath18he and @xmath40xe spins@xcite . since the @xmath41 times of helium and xenon",
    "can be determined directly from the experiment , four fit parameters for each subrun are left , i.e. , the fit model is basically a linear function in the parameter set . by fitting the corrected phase difference @xmath42 and subtracting the fit from the data we obtain the phase residuals , shown in fig .",
    "[ aba : phases_residuals ] for a decisive subrun . because of the exponential decay of the @xmath0he and @xmath1xe signal amplitudes",
    " mainly @xmath1xe with @xmath9 of only 4 to 5h  the snr decreases , respectively the phase noise increases , in time .    for a combined fit to all 7 subruns we defined a piecewise fit function @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the amplitude of a possible lorentz violating phase shift modulated with the frequency @xmath45 of a sidereal day , and @xmath46 a constant phase offset .",
    "note that the function @xmath42 is defined for each subrun separately whereas the sine function describes the possible lorentz violating phase shift for all subruns .",
    "the best combined fit of all 7 subruns with the parameter given by equation ( [ aba : f = fi+sin+cos ] ) results in a lorentz violating phase shift of @xmath47(2.25@xmath482.29)mrad ( 95@xmath49 c.l . ) corresponding to @xmath50 .",
    "the correlated and the uncorrelated 1@xmath51-errors of @xmath44 are @xmath52 the uncorrelated error is smaller than the correlated one by a factor of about 50 .",
    "the phase amplitude @xmath44 is mainly correlated with the fit parameters @xmath39 from the exponential terms in eq .",
    "( [ aba : modellorentzfit ] ) , since the latter ones show a similar time structure as the sidereal modulation in the inital time intervals @xmath53@xmath54 of each subrun where the snr is still large .",
    "the lorentz violating sme coefficient @xmath55 of the bound neutron@xcite can be calculated by @xmath56 where _ h _ is the planck constant , @xmath57 the angle between the earth s rotation axis and the quantization axis of the spin ( @xmath58 ) , and @xmath59 .    up to now ,",
    "our experiments determine only an upper limit for the lorentz violating sme coefficient , but we still have room for improvements .",
    "the increase of the @xmath9 time , and thus longer observation time _",
    "t _ reaching at least 24h for each subrun , would greatly reduce the correlated error . at present",
    ", the relatively short wall relaxation time of xenon ( @xmath60 ) limits the total observation time _",
    "t _ in our experiment",
    ". therefore efforts to increase @xmath61 considerably are essential . for",
    "helium @xmath62 seems possible and transverse spin relaxation times @xmath63 of up to 60h have already been observed@xcite .",
    "longer observation times @xmath64 also cause a higher sensitivity in frequency measurement according to the cramer - rao lower bound ( eq .  ( [ aba : crlb ] ) ) .",
    "the exponential terms which are strongly correlated to the lorentz violating amplitude @xmath44 can be reduced considerably by rotating the cell to an appropriate position with respect to the magnetic guiding field .",
    "this way , one can minimize demagnetization induced effects@xcite .",
