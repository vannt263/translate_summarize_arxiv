    "x - ray binary systems vary on timescales ranging from months to milli - seconds ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . detailed analysis of their temporal variability and fluctuation provides important insights into the geometry and physics of emitting regions and the accretion process .",
    "however , the origin of variability is still not clear",
    ". it could be due to varying external parameters , like the infalling mass accretion rate .",
    "it could also be due to possible instabilities in the inner regions of the accretion disk where the flow is expected to be nonlinear and turbulent .",
    "uttley et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ( see also timmer et al . 2000 and thiel et al .",
    "2001 ) argued that the non - linear behavior of a system can be understood from the log - normal distribution of the fluxes and the @xmath0-flux relation .",
    "this implies that the temporal behavior of the system may be driven by underlying stochastic variations . by studying the underlying nonlinear behavior ,",
    "important constraints can be obtained on these various possibilities .",
    "an elegant way of obtaining the constraint is to perform the nonlinear time series analysis of observed data and to compute the correlation dimension @xmath1 in a non - subjective manner .",
    "this technique has already been used to diverse situations ( @xcite , and references therein ) . by obtaining @xmath1 as a function of the embedding dimension @xmath2",
    ", one can infer the origin of the variability .",
    "for example , @xmath3 for all @xmath2 corresponds to the system having stochastic fluctuation which favors the idea that x - ray variations are driven by variations of some external parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "a saturated @xmath1 to a finite ( low ) value , beyond a certain m , implies a deterministic chaos which argues in favor of inner disk instability .",
    "however , to implement the algorithm successfully , the system in question should provide enough data .",
    "the technique was used earlier to understand the nonlinear nature of a black hole system cyg  x-1 @xcite and an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) ark  564 @xcite , but due to insufficient data points the analyses were hampered and no concrete conclusions were made about @xmath1 . later on , another black hole system grs  1915 + 105 was analyzed @xcite which was shown to display low dimensional chaos in certain temporal classes , while stochastic in other classes .",
    "however , so far none of the neutron star systems have been analyzed in detail in order to understand the origin of nonlinearity .",
    "decades back , voges et al .",
    "( 1987 ) attempted to understand the chaotic nature of her  x-1 , but the analysis was hampered by low signal to noise ratio @xcite . since then the investigation of chaotic signature in neutron stars remains unattended .",
    "can a neutron star system not be deterministic ?",
    "indeed several features of x - ray binary systems consisting of a neutron star , such as their magnetosphere and khz quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) and its possible relation to the spin frequency of the neutron star , favor the idea that they exhibit nonlinear resonance ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "while the qpo itself is a mysterious feature whose origin is still unclear , its possible link to the spin frequency of the neutron star indicates the origin of qpo to be from nonlinear phenomena .",
    "several lmxbs having a neutron star exhibit twin khz qpos @xcite .",
    "for some of them , e.g. 4u  1636 - 53 @xcite , ks  1731 - 260 @xcite , 4u  1702 - 429 @xcite , 4u  1728 - 34 @xcite , the spin frequency of the neutron star has been predicted from observed data .",
    "however , for the source sco  x-1 , which exhibits noticeable time variability @xcite , while we observe twin khz qpos , we do not know the spin frequency yet ( but see @xcite ) . for another neutron star cyg  x-2",
    ", we do observe khz qpos @xcite as well .",
    "several black holes also exhibit qpos , e.g. grs  1915 + 105 @xcite , cyg  x-1 @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we first aim at analyzing the time series of two neutron star sources sco  x-1 and cyg  x-2 to understand if a neutron star is a deterministic nonlinear ( chaotic ) system .",
    "then we try to manifest the knowledge of nonlinear ( chaotic / random ) property of compact sources to distinguish a black hole from a neutron star .",
    "subsequently , knowing their difference based on the said property , we try to identify the nature of a unknown source ( whether it is a black hole or a neutron star ) . while the nature of some sources , as mentioned above , has already been predicted based on alternate method , for some others , e.g. cyg  x-3 , ss433 , it has not yet been confirmed .    for the present purpose ,",
    "we therefore concentrate on three additional sources cyg  x-1 , cyg  x-2 and cyg  x-3 .",
    "while cyg  x-1 has been predicted to be a black hole and cyg  x-2 be a neutron star , the nature of cyg  x-3 is not confirmed yet .",
    "some authors @xcite argued for a black hole nature of cyg x-3 , on the basis of its jet , the time variations in the infrared emission lines , the bepposax x - ray spectra and so on .",
    "however , earlier it was argued for a neutron star @xcite by measuring its @xmath4 gev @xmath5-rays which suggests a pulsar period of @xmath6 ms . by analyzing the time series and computing the correlation dimension @xmath1 , here we aim at pinpointing the nature of cyg  x-3",
    ": whether a black hole or a neutron star .    in the next section , we briefly outline the procedure to be followed in understanding the nonlinear nature of a compact object from observed data and to implement it to analyze the neutron star source sco  x-1 . in  3 , we then describe nonlinear behaviors of cyg  x-1 , cyg  x-2 and cyg  x-3 .",
    "subsequently , in  4 , we compare all the results and argue for a black hole nature of cyg  x-3 . finally , we summarize in  5 .",
    "the method to obtain @xmath1 is already established ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . therefore",
    ", here we discuss it briefly .",
    "we consider pca data of the rxte satellite ( see table 1 for the observations ids ) from the archive for our analysis .",
    "we process the data using the ftools software .",
    "we extract a few continuous data streams of @xmath7 sec long .",
    "the time resolution used to generate lightcurves is @xmath8 sec .",
    "this is the range of optimum resolution , at least for the sources we consider , to minimize noise without losing physical information of the sources .",
    "a finer time resolution would be poisson noise dominated and a larger binning might give too few data points to derive physical parameters from it ( see misra et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 , for details ) .",
    "then we calculate the correlation dimension according to the grassberger @xmath9 procaccia ( 1983a , b ) algorithm . from the time",
    "series @xmath10 ( i = 1,2, ...",
    ",n ) , we construct an m dimensional space ( called embedding space ) , in which any vector has the following form : @xmath11,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the time delay chosen in such a way that each component of the vector @xmath13 is independent of each other . for a particular choice of embedding dimension @xmath2 ,",
    "we compute the correlation function :    @xmath14    which is basically the average number of points within a hypersphere of diameter @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a heaviside step function , @xmath17 the total number of points and @xmath18 the number of centers .",
    "if the system has a strange attractor , then one can show that for a small value of @xmath15 @xmath19    in this numerical calculation , we divide the whole phase space into @xmath2 cubes of length @xmath15 around a point and we count the average number of data points in these cubes to calculate @xmath20 .",
    "the edge effects , which come due to the finite number of data points , have been avoided by calculating @xmath20 in the range @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the value of @xmath15 for @xmath20 just greater than one and @xmath23 can be found by restricting the @xmath2 cubes to be within the embedding space . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we show the variation of log@xmath24 with log@xmath25 for different values of @xmath2 for sco x-1 data .",
    "@xmath26 can be calculated from the linear part of the @xmath27 vs. @xmath28 curve and its value depends on the value of @xmath2 . for a stochastic system , @xmath29 for all @xmath2 . on the other hand , for a chaotic or deterministic system ,",
    "initially @xmath26 increases linearly with the increase of @xmath2 , then it reaches a certain value and saturates .",
    "this saturated value of @xmath30 is taken to be the correlation dimension of the system which is a non - integer .",
    "the standard deviation gives the error in @xmath30 .",
    "we first concentrate upon the neutron star source sco  x-1 . in figs .",
    "[ fig1]a , b we show respectively the lightcurve and the variation of @xmath1 as a function of @xmath2 and find that @xmath1 saturates to a value @xmath31 . as this is a non - integer , the system might be chaotic .",
    "on the other hand , we know that the lorenz attractor is an example of an ideal chaos with @xmath32",
    ". therefore , sco  x-1 may be like a lorenz system .",
    "but due to noise its @xmath1 seems appearing slightly higher @xcite than the actual value",
    ". however , one should be cautious about the fact that sco  x-1 is a bright source ( much brighter than other sources considered later ) .",
    "hence , the dead time effect on the detector might affect the actual value of saturated @xmath1 and the computed value might be slightly different than the actual one . however , this can not rule out the signature of chaos in sco  x-1 , particularly because the corresponding count rates are confined in the same order of magnitude and hence the dead time effect , if any , is expected to affect all the count rates in a similar way .",
    "however , a saturated @xmath1 is necessary but not a sufficient evidence for chaos .",
    "existence of color noise ( for which the power spectrum @xmath33 , where the power spectral indices @xmath34 = 0 , 1 and 2 correspond to  white \" ,  pink \" and  red \" noise respectively ) into a stochastic system might lead to a saturated @xmath1 of low value as well ( e.g. osborne & provenzale 1989 ; theiler et al 1992 ; misra et al .",
    "2006 ; harikrishnan et al .",
    "therefore , it is customary to analyze data by alternate approach(s ) to distinguish it from a pure noisy time series @xcite .",
    "one of the techniques is the surrogate data analysis ( e.g. @xcite ) , which has been described earlier in detail and implemented for a black hole @xcite . in brief ,",
    "surrogate data is random data generated by taking the original signal and reprocessing it so that data has the same / similar fourier power spectrum and autocorrelation along with the same distribution , mean and variance as of the original data , but has lost all deterministic characters .",
    "then the same analysis is carried out to the original data and the surrogate data to identify any distinguishable feature(s ) between them .",
    "the scheme proposed by schreiber & schmitz ( 1996 ) , known as iterative amplitude - adjusted fourier transform ( iaaft ) , is more consistent to generate surrogate data .",
    "figures [ fig1]c - f compare results for the original data with the surrogate data .",
    "it is clear that while distributions and power spectra are same / similar for both the data sets , @xmath1 is much higher for the surrogate data which suggests existence of low dimensional chaos in sco  x-1 with @xmath35 .",
    "this confirms , for the first time to best of our knowledge , a neutron star source to display chaotic behavior . as the existence of chaos is a plausible signature of instability in the inner region of accretion flows which is nonlinear and turbulent , as mentioned in  1 , the corresponding qpo , which is presumably an inner disk phenomenon as well , is expected to be governed by nonlinear resonance mechanisms ( e.g. mukhopadhyay 2009 ) .    in table 1",
    ", we enlist the average counts @xmath36 , its root mean square ( @xmath0 ) variation @xmath37 , the expected poisson noise @xmath38 , and the ratio of the expected poisson noise to the @xmath0 value for all sources .",
    "it clearly shows a strong correlation between the inferred behavior of the systems and the ratio of the expected poisson noise to the @xmath0 value .",
    "we now look into three additional compact sources : cyg  x-1 ( black hole ) , cyg  x-2 ( neutron star ) and cyg  x-3 ( nature is not confirmed yet ) , and apply the same analysis as in the case of sco  x-1 .",
    "figure [ fig2]b shows that @xmath1 for cyg  x-1 seems not to saturate and appears very high .",
    "however , there is no surprise in it because its variability is similar to the temporal class @xmath39 of the black hole grs  1915 + 105 which was shown to be poisson noise dominated and stochastic in nature @xcite . indeed , earlier analysis of cyg  x-1 data , while it could not conclusively quantify the underlying chaotic behavior due to insufficient data , revealed very high dimensional chaos .",
    "moreover a large @xmath40 ( as well @xmath41 ) for cyg  x-1 , compared to that for sco  x-1 given in table 1 , reveals the system to be noise dominated .",
    "this ensures cyg  x-1 to be different from sco  x-1 .",
    "however , the variation of @xmath1 as a function of @xmath2 for the original data does not deviate noticeably from that of corresponding surrogate data , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]c , which argues that cyg  x-1 is not a chaotic system .",
    "figures [ fig3]b , c show that @xmath1 for cyg  x-2 saturates to a low value @xmath42 , which is significantly different than that of corresponding surrogate data .",
    "the power spectra and distributions , on the other hand , for original and surrogate data are same / similar ( as shown in sco  x-1 , not repeated further ) .",
    "the saturated @xmath1 for cyg  x-2 is almost double than that of lorenz system , possibly due to high poisson noise to @xmath0 ratio ( see table-1 ) .",
    "this suggests the corresponding system to be a low dimensional chaos .    from figs .",
    "[ fig4]b , c we see that for cyg  x-3 the variations of @xmath1 as a function of @xmath2 for original and surrogates data are similar to that of cyg  x-1 .",
    "this confirms that the behavior of the unknown source cyg  x-3 is similar to that of the black hole source cyg  x-1 ( see , however , @xcite ) . note from table 1 that cyg",
    "x-1 , x-2 , x-3 are significantly noise dominated compared to sco  x-1 .",
    "although noise could not suppress the chaotic signature in the neutron star cyg  x-2 , its saturated @xmath1 is higher than that of sco  x-1 . on the other hand , even though the poisson noise to @xmath0 ratio in cyg  x-1 is lower than that in cyg  x-2 ( but poisson noise itself is higher in cyg  x-1 ) , its @xmath1 never saturates , which confirms the source to be non - chaotic ; the apparent stochastic signature is not due to poisson noise present into the system .",
    "finally , we compare the variations of @xmath1 for all three cases of cygnus in fig .",
    "remarkably we find that @xmath1 values for cyg  x-1 and cyg  x-3 practically overlap , appearing much larger compared to that for cyg  x-2 which is shown to be a low dimensional chaotic source . on the other hand ,",
    "cyg  x-2 is a confirmed neutron star and cyg  x-1 a black hole .",
    "therefore , cyg  x-3 may be a black hole .",
    "the source cyg  x-3 , whose nature is not confirmed yet , seems to be a black hole based on the analysis of its nonlinear behavior . on the other hand ,",
    "we have shown , for the first time to best of our knowledge , that neutron star systems could be chaotic in nature .",
    "the signature of deterministic chaos , which argues in favor of inner disk instability , into an accreting system has implications in understanding its transport properties particularly in keplerian accretion disk @xcite .",
    "note that in keplerian accretion disks transport is necessarily due to turbulence in absence of significant molecular viscosity .",
    "the signature of chaos confirms instability and then plausible turbulence . on the other hand",
    ", for a rotating neutron star having a magnetosphere , signature of chaos suggests their qpos to be nonlinear resonance phenomena @xcite .",
    "the absence of chaos and related / plausible signature of instability in cyg x-1 and cyg x-3 suggests the underlying accretion disk to be sub - keplerian @xcite in nature which is dominated significantly by gravitational force .",
