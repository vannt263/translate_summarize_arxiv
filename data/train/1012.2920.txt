    "molecular motors are protein molecules that can convert chemical energy , usually in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) , into mechanical forces and motion .",
    "most organisms have many different motors that are specialized for particular purposes such as cell division , cell crawling , cell shape maintenance and movements of internal organelles @xcite .",
    "three different linear families of molecular motors have been identified @xcite : kinesins and dyneins that move along microtubule , myosins that move along actin filaments . from a theoretical point of view , molecular motors are microscopic objects that move unidirectionally along periodic structures .",
    "the problem of this unidirectionality belongs to a larger class of such problems involving rectifying processes at small scale .",
    "noise - induced transport phenomena play a crucial role in molecular motors@xcite .",
    "a molecular motor is usually described by a ratchet system which is generally defined as a system that is able to transport particles in a periodic structure with nonzero macroscopic velocity in the absence of macroscopic force on average .",
    "+ in these systems , directed brownian motion of particles is generated by nonequilibrium noises in the absence of any net macroscopic forces and potential gradients .",
    "typical examples are rocking ratchets @xcite , flashing ratchets @xcite , diffusion ratchets @xcite , correlation ratchets @xcite and white - shot - noise ratchets @xcite . in all these studies ,",
    "the potential is asymmetric in space .",
    "it has shown that a unidirectional current can also appear for spatially symmetric potentials if the external random force is either asymmetric or spatially dependent .",
    "if spatially periodic structures are exposed to an additive poissonian white shot noise , a macroscopic current occurs even in the absence of spatial asymmetry @xcite . +",
    "most studies have revolved around the energy barrier .",
    "the nature of the barrier depends on which thermodynamic potential ( internal energy or helmholtz free energy ) varies when passing from one well to the other , and its presence plays an important role in the dynamics of the system . whereas energy barriers are more frequent in problem of solid - state physics ( metals and semiconductors , coupled josephson junction and photon crystal ) ,",
    "entropy barriers are often encountered in soft - condensed matter and biological systems .",
    "entropy barriers may appear when coarsening the description of a complex system in order to simplify its dynamics .",
    "reguera and co - workers @xcite used the mesoscopic nonequilibrium thermodynamics theory to derive the general kinetic equation of the motor system and analyzed in detail the case of diffusion in a domain of irregular geometry in which the presence of the boundaries induces an entropy barrier when approaching the dynamics by a coarsening of the description . in their recent work @xcite",
    ", they studied the current and the diffusion of a brownian particle moving in a symmetric channel with a biased external force .",
    "they found that temperature dictates the strength of the entropic potential , and thus an increasing of temperature leads to a reduction of the current .",
    "the focus of previous works on current were limited to the case of energy barriers in the presence of asymmetry in space or time .",
    "the present work is extended to the study to case of entropic barriers in the presence symmetry in space and time .",
    "we emphasize on finding how phase shift between the tube shape and the potential can induce a net current .",
    "our model is to describe the movement of kinesins and dyneins along microtubule .",
    "phenomena of current reversals may be of interest in molecular motors@xcite .",
    "kinesins and dyneins move along tubulin filaments towards their plus and minus extremities , respectively .",
    "it is well known that the two current reversals effect allows one pair of motor proteins ( two members)to move simultaneously in opposite directions along the microtubule inside the eukaryotic cells .",
    "one member of the pair moves one way along the tube while the other member of the pair moves in the opposite direction . in order to describe the movement of kinesins and dyneins along tubulin",
    ", a periodic tube model is proposed .",
    "we consider a brownian particle moving in a symmetric periodic tube [ fig .",
    "1 ] in the presence of a temporally symmetric unbiased external force .",
    "its overdamped dynamics is described by the following langevin equations written in a dimensionless form @xcite ,",
    "@xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 are the three - dimensional ( 3d ) coordinates , @xmath6 is the friction coefficient of the particle , @xmath7 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath8 is the absolute temperature and @xmath9 is the gaussian white noise with zero mean and correlation function : @xmath10 for @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 denotes an ensemble average over the distribution of noise .",
    "@xmath13 is the dirac delta function .",
    "imposing reflecting boundary conditions in the transverse direction ensures the confinement of the dynamics within the tube , while periodic boundary conditions are enforced along the longitudinal direction for the reasons noted above .",

    "the shape of the tube ( describing the structure of molecular motors ) is described by its radius , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the parameter that controls the slope of the tube , @xmath24 is the relative phase shift between @xmath25 and @xmath18 .",

    "reduction of the spatial dimensionality from two or three physical dimensions to an effective one dimensional system may involve not only the appearance of an entropic barrier , but also the effective diffusion coefficient .",

    "because the results from two and three dimensions are very similar , for the convenience of physical discussion , we now mainly investigate the current in three dimensions with @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the results are shown in figs . 2 - 5 .",
    "figure 2 shows the current contours on @xmath50 plane .",
    "there are two hills and two vales in the plot .",
    "the current is negative in area a and c , positive in area b and d. in our model , the potential and the tube shape in space and the external force in time are symmetric .",
    "it is obvious that the phase shift between the potential and the tube shape leads to a net current .",
    "however , the current is always zero at @xmath51 , @xmath24 and @xmath52 .",
    "when @xmath53 and @xmath54 , the particle will undergo a hill and a vale on increasing temperature , namely , the current reverses its direction .",
    "when temperature is increased , the particle will undergo only a hill or a vale for @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the current is always zero at @xmath57 . because of the numerical trouble near @xmath58 and low temperature , the numerical results at @xmath58 and low temperature meet a little error .",
    "however , from the effective potential ( eq .",
    "( 9 ) ) , it is easy to find that the effective potential is symmetric and the current is zero at @xmath58 . so the line at @xmath57 should be vertical .    the current @xmath59 as a function of temperature @xmath8 is shown in fig . 3 for different values of @xmath24 .",
    "when @xmath60 , the particle can not pass the barrier , so the current @xmath59 tends to zero .",
    "when @xmath61 , the thermal noise is very large , so the ratchet effect disappears and the current @xmath59 approaches zero , also .",
    "there exist optimized temperatures at which the current @xmath59 takes its maximal or minimal values .",
    "when @xmath62 ( @xmath53 ) and @xmath63(@xmath54 ) , current reversals may occur on increasing temperature .",
    "the current is always positive and negative for @xmath64 ( @xmath55 ) and @xmath65 ( @xmath56 ) , respectively .",
    "it is easy to see from the figs . 2 and 3 that the current on increasing temperature may reverse its direction for @xmath53 and @xmath54 and is always positive at all temperatures for @xmath55 or negative for @xmath56 .",
    "in order to illustrate the current ( see fig .",
    "3 ) in detail , the effective potential @xmath66 along the @xmath3 coordinate is plotted in fig .",
    "4 . from the previous works@xcite",
    ", we can obtain that there is no current when the effective potential is symmetric .",
    "when the right of the potential in a period is steeper than the left , the current is positive .",
    "the current is negative when the left is steeper . in fig 4 ( a)(@xmath62 ) ,",
    "the left is steeper than the right ( inducing a positive current ) at low temperatures . however , when temperature is increased , the right may be steeper than the left ( inducing a negative current ) at high temperatures . for the case @xmath67 ( fig .",
    "4(d ) ) , the current is negative at low temperatures and positive at high temperatures .",
    "therefore , the current can change its direction on increasing temperature for these two cases ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) . in fig .",
    "4 ( b ) ( @xmath64 ) , the right is always steeper than the left , so the current is always positive .",
    "the left is always steeper than the right at @xmath68 ( fig .",
    "4 ( c ) ) , so the current is always negative . in these two cases ,",
    "no current reversal occurs .",
    "figure 5 shows the current @xmath59 as a function of the phase shift @xmath24 .",
    "there is no net current at @xmath51 , @xmath69 and @xmath52 for all temperatures .",
    "there are two peaks and two vales in the curve on increasing the phase shift at @xmath70 ( low temperature ) .",
    "the current can change its direction even three times when the phase shift is changed . at high temperature ( @xmath71 ) , only one peak and one vale appear and the current reverses its direction at @xmath57 .",
    "in present work , we study the transport of a brownian particle moving along the axis of three - dimensional periodic tube in the presence of a temporally symmetric unbiased force and a symmetric potential . the movement equation can be described by the fick - jacobs equation which is derived from 3d ( or 2d ) smoluchowski equation after elimination of @xmath4 and @xmath5 coordinates .",
    "reduction of the coordinates may induce the appearance of an entropic barrier and the effective diffusion coefficient .",
    "the current is achieved by solving one - dimensional fick - jacobs equation .",
    "+ it is found that the phase shift between the tube shape and the potential may induce a net current even when the potential , the tube shape and the external force are symmetric .",
    "the symmetry of the effective potential can be broken by changing temperature or the phase shift .",
    "when @xmath53 and @xmath54 , current reversal may occur on increasing temperature . however , the current is always positive for @xmath55 or negative for @xmath56 .",

    "this can be explained by current reversals    the results we have presented have broad applications in many processes @xcite , such as molecular motors movement through the microtubule in the absence of any net macroscopic forces @xcite , ion transport through ion channels @xcite , motion of polymers subjected to rigid constraints @xcite , drug release @xciteand polymer crystallization @xcite . in these systems ,",
