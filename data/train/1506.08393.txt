    "group field theories @xcite ( gfts ) are a candidate formalism for the fundamental degrees of freedom of quantum spacetime ( the atoms of space ) , and an approach to quantum gravity which merges insights and mathematical structures from loop quantum gravity and spin foam models @xcite , simplicial quantum gravity and tensor models @xcite , which have all achieved remarkable progress in recent years .",
    "they share with loop quantum gravity the general structure of quantum states , associated to graphs labeled by group - theoretic data , and indeed can be seen as a 2nd quantized , fock space - based reformulation of both its kinematics and its operator dynamics @xcite . and they encode and complete the covariant definition of the same quantum dynamics , formulated in terms of spin foam models , which in fact appear generically as gft feynman amplitudes @xcite . the same amplitudes can be recast in the form of simplicial gravity path integrals @xcite , clarifying their discrete geometric content , and substantiating further the analysis of the quantum geometry of loop quantum gravity states and spin foam amplitudes @xcite . at the same time , they are based on the same combinatorial structures ( in their action , feynman graphs and transition amplitudes ) of tensor models , which they enrich by adding group - theoretic data .",
    "the hope is that this nice interplay between combinatorics and algebra , in a quantum field theory setting , will prove powerful enough to explain from first principles the emergence of spacetime and geometry from more fundamental entities , i.e. the dynamical realization in the full quantum theory of a regime where the fundamental degrees of freedom of the theory , which are generically not interpretable in geometric terms and at best can be associated to piecewise - flat geometries , can be approximated well by smooth manifolds and a smooth geometric field , governed by ( a possibly modified form of ) the equations of general relativity @xcite .    indeed , not only they merge the key elements of these related approaches ( and thus most results obtained in them ) , e.g. the quantum states and variables of loop quantum gravity , the amplitudes of spin foam models , the combinatorial structures of tensor models , but group field theories offer a promising mathematical context for tackling some of their outstanding open issues , thanks to qft methods , most notably renormalization . in particular , they allow to identify stringent criteria for : constraining spin foam model building , controlling quantisation ambiguities in both spin foam and canonical formulations of loop quantum gravity , and ensuring consistency of the resulting quantum dynamics .",
    "these issues , in fact , translate into the problem of proving perturbative renormalizability of their gft reformulation , since the gft action encodes the choice of operator spin network dynamics and the gft feynman amplitudes coincide with spin foam models . the issue of controlling the sum over spin foam complexes , which completes the definition of spin foam models , and of defining the full quantum spin network dynamics , i.e. going beyond the perturbative treatment and summing all spin foam diagrams , encoded in a projection operator onto physical states or in their partition function , on the other hand , translates into the problem of making sense of the corresponding non - perturbative gft dynamics and of unravelling the macroscopic phase diagram ( and interesting phase transitions ) of the theory .",
    "this is the problem of the continuum limit of the theory , which is in many ways _ the _ outstanding issue of the whole approach ( alongside the physical issue of extracting the effective dynamics of the theory in the same continuum limit ) .",
    "again , qft tools become available thanks to the gft reformulation , be it in the form of constructive renormalisation or of functional renormalisation group techniques .",
    "it is here that the input from tensor models has proven most relevant , in particular , the large body of recent results on colored tensor models @xcite , where the use of colour labels on combinatorial structures ensures a greater control over their topology , and an analytic understanding of their scaling limits . in turn , this led to important results about the universality classes of tensor models , and to a precise suggestion for the class of allowed tensor interactions : those satisfying a tensor invariancecriterion , which can be seen as the tensor analogue of the notion of locality in standard quantum field theory on flat spacetime .",
    "this becomes particularly relevant for group field theories and their renormalisation analysis .",
    "in fact , by treating gft fields as quantum geometrically - enriched tensors , one has then a prescription for the relevant theory space that the renormalisation group flow should explore .",
    "this defines the class of gfts known as _ tensorial group field theories _ ( tgfts ) , where most work on renormalisation has been carried out ( after the very first step in this research direction @xcite ) .    beside constructive analysis @xcite and the first frg studies @xcite , most developments up to now concerned perturbative renormalizability of tgft models .",
    "such development can be seen as progressively approaching tgft models for 4d quantum gravity , as developed in the spin foam context . the first models @xcite that have been shown to be renormalizable to all orders in perturbation theory were abelian ones , with the tgft field defined on several copies of a @xmath7 group manifold ( the number of copies matching the dimensionality of the cellular complex arising in their feynman expansion ) .",
    "next @xcite came abelian models incorporating a gauge invariance condition in their amplitudes , which turns them into lattice gauge theories and proper spin foam models , and gives the states of the theory the structure of spin networks . then came the first proof of perturbative renormalizability at all orders of a non - abelian model , based on @xmath2 , with the same gauge invariance @xcite . for many of these models ,",
    "the renormalizability analysis was completed by the computation of the beta functions , with very interesting results on their asymptotic freedom ( or safety ) @xcite .",
    "a bulk of solid work and understanding has therefore already accumulated .",
    "the stage is now set for tackling full - blown 4d quantum gravity models , as developed in the spin foam context ( recall that the topological dimension of the simplicial structures generated by the tgft perturbative expansion corresponds to the rank of the tgft field , thus 4d gravity models require tgft fields of rank @xmath4 ) .",
    "some results on radiative corrections in the simplicial setting ( where more is known also in the 3d case @xcite ) are available @xcite , but we lack any systematic analysis , like the ones mentioned in the tgft setting . beside a better geometric understanding of the tensor invariance@xmath8condition ,",
    "this requires a generalisation to higher - dimensional non - abelian groups , i.e. @xmath9 or the even more interesting non - compact lorentz group @xmath10 , and , most important , the imposition of additional constraints on the amplitudes , the so - called simplicity constraints(see @xcite and references therein )",
    ".    the most developed strategy for model - building in 4d , in fact , is based on the so - called plebanski - holst formulation of classical general relativity in the continuum . here , the basic fields are a 2-form valued in the lie algebra of the lorentz group @xmath10 ( or its euclidean counterpart @xmath9 ) , usually indicated as @xmath11 and a 1-form connection field @xmath12 valued in the same algebra .",
    "these are the same field variables of a topological field theory of bf - type in 4d .",
    "the dynamics of the gravitational theory is defined by an action that add to the bf action a set of constraints on the @xmath11 field ( dependent on an additional parameter called immirzi parameter , which also plays a crucial role in canonical loop quantum gravity ) . these are called simplicity constraints .",
    "they have the effect of forcing the constrained 2-forms @xmath11 to be functions of a tetrad field .",
    "inserting such solutions of the constraints back into the action one obtains a palatini formulation of gravity in terms of the tetrad field and the connection @xmath12 , plus a topological term ( not affecting the classical theory ) dependent on the immirzi parameter .",
    "current spin foam models , and the corresponding gft models , follow a similar procedure at the quantum level , after the discrete counterpart of the simplicity constraints has been identified , so to be applied to the discrete variables that correspond to the @xmath11 field and are assigned to a simplicial complex .",
    "one then starts with a quantum formulation of topological bf theory and imposes a quantum counterpart of the simplicity constraints , to get a model for quantum 4d gravity . for more details , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "depending on the exact model considered ( i.e. the chosen way of imposing the simplicity constraints and the value of the so - called immirzi parameter ) , these have the effect of reducing the initial domain of the gft fields from the lorentz group ( or its euclidean counterpart @xmath9 ) to its homogeneous space @xmath13 ( or @xmath14 ) , or to another sub- manifold of the same group . this is the main physical reason why we are interested in ( t)gft models based on such domain manifolds .",
    "a renormalizability analysis of tgft models of 4d quantum gravity requires therefore an extension of the known results and techniques from simple group manifolds to these more complicated domains , starting with homogeneous spaces .    in the present paper",
    ", we perform one more step towards establishing the renormalizability of 4d quantum gravity tgft models , by studying the renormalization of a tgft model on the homogeneous space @xmath15 , endowed with the additional gauge invariance conditions characterising spin foam models .",
    "this is the simplest model that still combines the three technical challenges required for a full analysis of tgft models for 4d gravity : restriction to a sub - manifold of the original group manifold , gauge invariance , and non - abelian character .",
    "the imposition of the constraints reducing the field variables to the homogeneous space is obtained in a covariant manner , using the formalism developed in @xcite . by rigorous multi - scale analysis ,",
    "we prove renormalizability to all orders in perturbation theory of the model for @xmath4 ( in @xmath16 our results imply super - renormalizability ) . for the same model",
    ", we also compute both the renormalised and effective perturbative series , analyse the 2-point and 4-point correlation functions , compute the beta function and establish asymptotic freedom at one - loop order .",
    "moreover , we generalise several of our results to arbitrary homogeneous spaces of the type @xmath17 ; in particular we establish a general abelian power counting and classify such models in terms of their potential renormalizability , as seen from the abelian power counting , for various choices of @xmath18 and @xmath3 .",
    "however , we also discuss why this can be a misleading classification , since the exact power counting of other non - abelian models may deviate from the abelian one , and what aspects of the analysis need to be carried out in detail for these cases in order to really prove ( or disprove ) their perturbative renormalizability .",
    "the model is defined in detail in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we provide an equivalent definition of the same model in terms of projections onto the homogeneous space , which is more elegant and lends itself immediately to the higher - dimensional generalisation .",
    "we then set - up the multi - scale analysis of the model , in section 4 , and obtain the abelian power counting .",
    "the analysis of perturbative renormalizability of the model is performed in section 5 , while in section 6 we go beyond this to study the full renormalisation flow of the model , computing also the renormalised and effective series . in section 7 , we report the study of the beta function at one - loop , and the proof of asymptotic freedom to the same order .",
    "we consider a tensorial quantum field theory on @xmath3 copies of the homogeneous space @xmath6 , which is isomorphic to the two dimensional sphere @xmath20 .",

    "but in fact , only a subset of these subgraphs is potentially dangerous , the subset noted @xmath694 in the previous section .",
    "the argument is that only this subset needs to be renormalized , and the effective amplitude @xmath695 is defined by @xmath696 about which we have the following theorem @xcite :    [ effective ] * _ ( existence of the effective expansion ) _ * : consider the formal ( bare ) power series defined by : @xmath697 where @xmath698 is the set of vertices in @xmath59 including all the interactions compatible with the just - renormalizability criterion and @xmath699 their coupling constants .",

    "a subtlety appears in this case because the @xmath72-point divergent graphs ( with degree @xmath718 ) introduce two counter - terms , one for the mass and one for the wave - function . for this reason we modify the previous definition of @xmath714 , and introduce the new definition : @xmath719",

    "remarkably , in the previous bound , renormalons do not appear .",
    "+ another important fact about the effective series and effective coupling constants is their relationship with the renormalized series .",
    "in fact , if we define the renormalized coupling by @xmath727 , and if we reframe the effective series in terms of the renormalized coupling , we find exactly the renormalized series .",
    "we have studied the renormalization of a tgft model on the homogeneous space @xmath15 , endowed with the additional gauge invariance condition , using multi - scale methods .",
    "we have proven renormalizability to all orders in perturbation theory for the model with melonic quartic interactions in @xmath4 ( and , implicitly , super - renormalizability for the model in @xmath16 ) .",
    "this is the first example of a renormalization analysis for a tgft model on a homogeneous space , rather than a group manifold , and a promising step forward towards 4d gravity models , which have similar formulations .",
    "for the same model , we have also computed both the renormalised and effective perturbative series , and established its asymptotic freedom at one - loop order , by the analysis of the @xmath72-point and @xmath439-point correlation functions .",
    "this is another interesting result , because it supports the view that asymptotic freedom is generic in tgfts , and even survives stepping out of the simple group - based setup to move to homogeneous spaces .",
    "clearly , however , more work is needed to confirm such general expectation .    whenever possible , we have also generalised our construction and results to arbitrary homogeneous spaces of the type @xmath17 .",
    "this included a general abelian power counting , and a corresponding classification of potentially just - renormalizable models , for various choices of @xmath18 and @xmath3 .",
    "however , as we pointed out , the exact power counting of such more general non - abelian models may deviate from the abelian one , and a more detailed case - by - case analysis needs to be carried out in order to prove ( or disprove ) their perturbative renormalizability .    to keep moving in the direction of @xmath439d quantum gravity models , as defined in the spin foam context , is our next goal .",
    "in particular , the mentioned detailed analysis of divergences and exact power counting should be performed for tgfts on the homogeneous space @xmath728 , the case @xmath4 corresponding to the so - called barrett - crane imposition of the simplicity constraints reducing topological bf theory to gravity ( see @xcite and references therein ) , defining interesting @xmath439d quantum gravity models ( in absence of the immirzi parameter ) .",
    "we expect the results of @xcite to be a good basis for such generalisation . and work in this direction is , in fact , well in progress @xcite .",
    "the lorentzian counterpart of these models would of course be the next target .",
    "after this , one would have the proper understanding and basis to tackle the deformation of such models induced by the immirzi parameter , which brings out of the homogeneous space setting to more general sub - manifolds of the @xmath9 ( or @xmath10 ) group manifold ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear that the path towards a renormalizable quantum field theory for the atoms of space@xmath729is still long , but it should be also clear that we are making steady and important progress along it .",
