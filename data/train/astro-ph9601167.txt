    "batse spectroscopy detector ( sd ) observations of the cyclotron line in the spectrum of the accretion - powered pulsar hercules x-1 provides an opportunity to assess the capability of the sds to detect such lines in the spectra of grbs .",
    "observations of her x-1 have been performed by many groups @xcite . in particular , analysis of data from the _ heao 1 _",
    "a4 instrument@xcite , which is a nai detector ( like the sds ) and has an effective area and resolution that are similar to a single sd , yields a line center energy @xmath5 = 36 kev and equivalent width @xmath6 = 8 kev . however , preliminary analysis@xcite of an initial sd pulsar mode observation of her x-1 indicated a line at @xmath0 44 kev , rather than at the expected energy of 36 kev .",
    "we confirm this result by applying rigorous statistical methods developed for analysis of grb spectra@xcite to the analysis of four batse sd observations of her x-1 .",
    "a companion paper@xcite describes studies that have been performed which confirm that the sds are functioning as expected .",
    ".analyzed batse sd observations of her x-1 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tabj ]    in fits to the peak - op difference spectra , we detect a line at @xmath0 44 kev with modest significance in the data from the first observation ( table  [ tabsing ] ) , but not in the data from any other observation .",
    "joint fits indicate that this line becomes more significant as we add the data from more observations ( table  [ tabj ] ) .",
    "however , the addition of data from the third observation reduces the significance of the line .",
    "this behavior may reflect the fact that each of the four observations covers a slightly different phase of the her x-1 35 d cycle .",
    "if we exclude the first observation from the joint fits , we find that we can not detect the line .",
    "we estimate the statistical error for each model parameter using monte carlo simulations of the best - fit models .",
    "the typical 1@xmath7 uncertainties for both @xmath5 and @xmath8 are @xmath0 1.0 - 1.5 kev .",
    "joint fits to four sd observations of her x-1 show strong evidence for a cyclotron scattering line at @xmath0 44 kev , rather than at the expected energy of 36 kev .",
    "a cyclotron line energy shift is unprecedented in observations of accretion - powered pulsars .",
    "a companion paper @xcite describes studies that have been conducted which confirm that the sds are functioning as expected .",
