    "in this paper , we present and use the explicit tube formulas obtained in @xcite , for general @xmath0-adic fractal strings , in order to derive exact fractal tube formulas for @xmath0-adic self - similar fractal strings .",
    "the general results are illustrated in the case of suitable nonarchimedean analogs of the cantor and the fibonacci strings .",
    "some particular attention is devoted to the 3-adic ( or nonarchimedean ) cantor string ( introduced and studied in @xcite , an appropriate counterpart of the archimedean cantor string , whose ` metric boundary ' is the 3-adic cantor set @xcite ) , a suitable @xmath0-adic analog of the classic ternary cantor set .",

    "we also point out the more recent review article @xcite which discusses a variety of potential applications of @xmath0-adic analysis in mathematical physics and biology .",
    "furthermore , several physicists and mathematical physicists have suggested that the small scale structure of spacetime may be fractal ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been suggested ( in @xcite for example ) that seemingly abstract objects such as nonarchimedean fields ( including the field of @xmath0-adic numbers ) can be helpful in order to understand the geometry of spacetime at sub - planckian scales .",
    "finally , we note that @xmath0-adic fractal strings ( and their possible quantized analogs ) may be helpful to obtain an appropriate adelic counterpart of ordinary ( real ) fractal strings , along with their quantization ( called fractal membranes ) , as introduced in @xcite .",
