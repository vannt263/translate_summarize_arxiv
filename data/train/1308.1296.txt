    "deriving the substellar imf requires a representative sample of objects whose ages are well - constrained .",
    "evolutionary models can then be used to assign masses and radii to these objects . however , because cooling is more rapid for less massive bodies , brown dwarfs of any given effective temperature have a well known degeneracy between age and mass . in very young ( 1 - 10  myr ) brown dwarfs this problem is most serious for the coolest and least massive objects with spectral types @xmath7 m8 and masses @xmath4 25  m@xmath8 ( see , for example , figure 5 of  @xcite , hereafter w09 ) , where objects with planetary masses and ages of @xmath51  myr are not well separated in the hrd from brown dwarfs with ages of @xmath510  myr and masses 3 times higher .",
    "the lyon dusty isochrones  @xcite and those of  @xcite agree in this . in order to derive the substellar imf ,",
    "this age - mass degeneracy must be lifted .",
    "it has been shown that source ages can be measured using gravity sensitive alkali metal absorption lines in the optical or near - infrared ( @xcite ;  @xcite ;  @xcite ;  @xcite , hereafter a07 ;  @xcite ;  @xcite ;  @xcite ) .",
    "this technique can differentiate 1 myr objects from 5 myr objects , and 5 - 10 myr objects from field dwarfs , since very young substellar objects rapidly contract to smaller radii .",
    "the radii of evolved field brown dwarfs have little dependence on age or mass  @xcite , while the radii of very young brown dwarfs can be up to six times the size of their final equilibrium radii  @xcite . in consequence ,",
    "their surface gravities ( @xmath9 ) can be substantially lower than those of older , more massive dwarfs of the same spectral type .",
    "theoretical models show that the luminosities of brown dwarfs decrease rapidly over time as they radiate away the internal energy supplied by gravity during the formation process ( e.g.  @xcite , hereafter b01 ) .",
    "therefore , many analyses have focussed on young clusters , where the higher luminosities of brown dwarfs at young ages allows the mass function to be derived for masses as low as 5 - 15m@xmath8 .    among the uncertainties in these models are those dealing with the ages of the objects and the accuracy of the models themselves .",
    "these uncertainties are most significant in the cases of very young brown dwarfs in pre - main sequence clusters .",
    "one uncertainty concerns a brown dwarf s initial energy .",
    "a ` hot start ' brown dwarf forms from the collapse of a molecular cloud . a brown dwarf formed in a ` cold start ' via core accretion has less gravitational potential energy stored as internal energy so that , mass for mass , the brown dwarf is cooler and less luminous than a ` hot start ' brown dwarf .",
    "after @xmath52 myr , runaway gas accretion produces a peak in the luminosity of ` cold start ' brown dwarfs  @xcite . for the next @xmath51 myr and regardless of their mass , ` cold start ' brown dwarfs outshine their ` hot start ' counterparts , after which they cool quickly and become less luminous than ` hot start ' brown dwarfs of a similar mass .",
    "this implies that ` cold start ' brown dwarfs older than a few myr would need to have higher masses in order to account for their observed luminosities .",
    "we note that since ` cold start ' brown dwarfs form from a protoplanetary disk , this formation model is unlikely to apply to isolated brown dwarfs",
    ".    the constant mass accretion rate described in the standard model of star formation (  @xcite ;  @xcite ) may give rise to the  luminosity problem \" , exemplified in the case of young nearby t tauri stars with solar luminosities .",
    "these stars are under - powered in the sense that they should have several solar luminosities if they are descending approximately vertical hayashi tracks on the hrd  @xcite , depending on how young they are when they are observed",
    ". time - variable accretion may resolve the ",
    "luminosity problem \" .",
    "it has been shown that episodic bouts of accretion rather than a spread of ages can also explain the luminosity spread in young clusters  ( @xcite , hereafter b12 ) .",
    "these various uncertainties become less of a problem after only a few myr , but they must be considered when dealing with the youngest brown dwarfs .",
    "in this paper we investigate spectral signatures of age for substellar objects in pre - main sequence clusters .",
    "previous work by this group and others has established the existence of a population of pmos in the onc ( @xcite , hereafter l06 ;  @xcite ) .",
    "a statistical analysis of the luminosity function by w09 indicates that most substellar objects in the cluster have ages of order 1  myr , and it is unlikely that the pmo candidates represent a tail of older and more massive objects .",
    "however , the size of the planetary mass population can not be tightly constrained until their ages are known with better precision .",
    "the observations described in this paper were intended to produce the highest resolution spectra yet obtained ( r@xmath05000 ) of three pmos in the onc and a sample of brighter calibrator brown dwarfs with known ages and/or gravities , including three objects on the deuterium - burning threshold in the @xmath1  orionis cluster . in the event , we were unable to obtain useful data for two of the three onc targets .",
    "however , the high quality of the data obtained for all of the calibrators has enabled a useful investigation of the effects of surface gravity on the k  band spectra of very young brown dwarfs .",
    "our aim was to use medium resolution spectroscopy to investigate the sensitivity of the nai doublet at 2.21@xmath2 m to surface gravity , and hence age , while using the cai line at 2.26@xmath2 m and the co absorption bands at 2.29@xmath2 m and 2.32@xmath2 m to correct for any metallicity variations or veiling by hot dust .",
    "it was also intended to use these spectra to provide more precise spectral types than had been possible previously , and also to confirm that the imf extends below 10m@xmath8 .",
    "an unexpected by - product of the investigation was the discovery that the slope of the k  band also has strong sensitivity to gravity , which appears to provide a useful age indicator . while the effect of surface gravity on the k  band spectra of pre - main sequence brown dwarfs has previously been noted ( @xcite ; a07 ) , it has not been studied in detail .",
    "section 3 of this paper describes how our sample of brown dwarf calibrators and pmos were chosen .",
    "section 4 describes how these objects were observed , and how their spectra were extracted .",
    "results are reported in section 5 .",
    "section 5.1 contains the objects k  band spectra .",

    "section 6.2 uses models to show changes in the k  band slope with surface gravity .",
    "section 6.3 tests the h@xmath3(k ) index for the effects of hot dust , extinction , noise and metallicity , and examines whether the h@xmath3(k ) index varies as a function of spectral type .",

    "our results are discussed in section 8 .",

    "section 9 compares the strength of neutral alkali metal lines with the h@xmath3(k ) index as age indicators .",
    "section 10 contains our conclusions .",
    "in the last few years , large populations of brown dwarfs have been discovered in several very young clusters where the mass function appears to extend below the deuterium - burning threshold of 0.012 - 0.013m@xmath11 ( @xcite ;  @xcite ;  @xcite ;  @xcite ) .",
    "the onc contains the largest known sample of very young brown dwarfs , and therefore is an ideal site to obtain good statistics on the imf at planetary masses and to gain insights into low - mass brown dwarf formation processes .",
    "the formation mechanism responsible for the low masses of the substellar objects is currently unknown .",
    "the three onc pmos are 183@xmath6729 ( 18 ) , 152@xmath6717 ( 27 ) and 137@xmath6532 ( 172 ) ( @xcite ;  @xcite , hereafter lrt05 ) ( the numbers in brackets are the source catalogue numbers quoted in lrt05 ) . they were selected because each has a bright star @xmath12=15@xmath616 and @xmath13=17@xmath618 within @xmath525@xmath14 that could potentially be used as a tip / tilt guide star for laser - guided adaptive optics ( ao ) and they are bright enough for medium resolution ground based spectroscopy .",
    "we note that there is only a modest range of apparent k magnitudes amongst the spectroscopically confirmed pmos in l06 .",
    "their pmo status is based on their spectral types of @xmath5m9@xmath6l0 , their low surface gravities ( l06 ; w09 ) , and their low luminosities .",
    "low gravity was determined by comparing these objects h and k  band pseudo - continuum profiles with those of other low gravity brown dwarfs and high gravity field dwarfs in low resolution spectra .",
    "these features confirmed that these objects were cluster members , and therefore that their ages are unlikely to be more than @xmath510  myr .",
    "the pmos are within a few arcminutes of the centre of the onc , so they are likely to be very young ( @xmath51  myr ) objects , rather than members of the more dispersed and slightly older population that extends over a few degrees on the sky .    in the event ,",
    "useful observations were obtained for only one onc pmo , 152@xmath6717 .",
    "this source has apparent magnitude k=17.6 , which is typical of the sample in l06 .",
    "it was not possible to obtain a guide star lock for the other two pmos , owing to the bright background of the nebulosity .",
    "we note that this observing method could be more successfully employed in future when the patrol radius of the gemini altair ao system has been increased , allowing the use of brighter guide stars .",
    "the calibrators consisted of two field dwarfs , 2mass  0345 + 25 , hereafter 2mass  0345  @xcite , bri  0021@xmath60214 , hereafter bri  0021  @xcite , three 3 - 7  myr objects , @xmath1  orionis  51  @xcite , @xmath1  orionis  71  @xcite , @xmath1  orionis j053849.5@xmath6024934 , hereafter @xmath1  orionis j053@xmath6024 , and five 1 - 2  myr objects , kpno - tau  1  @xcite , kpno - tau  4  @xcite , kpno - tau  12  @xcite , 0457@xmath153015 , and 2mass  0535@xmath60546  @xcite .",
    "the calibrators were all chosen because they have similar spectral types to the onc pmos , with the exception of the eclipsing binary 2mass  0535@xmath60546 ( type m7 ) which was felt to be worthy of observation owing to the precisely known surface gravities of the components .",
    "the three @xmath1  orionis objects were selected because there was fairly good prior evidence that they were bona fide cluster members , as opposed to contaminating field dwarfs in front of this rather diffuse cluster .",
    "this evidence was either from previous spectroscopy of alkali metal lines ( @xmath1  orionis  51 , @xcite ) or from detection of mid - infrared excess and/or spectroscopic evidence ( @xmath1  orionis  71 , @xmath1  orionis  j053@xmath6024 , @xcite ) .",
    "being older , they can be used to compare objects of slightly greater mass and gravity .",
    "further selection criteria for the 1 - 2  myr calibrators in the taurus - auriga molecular cloud complex and field dwarf calibrators were that they are bright objects with little or no extinction and that previous studies have found them to be fairly typical objects with no obvious veiling by a circumstellar accretion disc ( see above references ) . while the 1 - 2  myr calibrators are more massive than the onc pmos , the lyon dusty isochrones predict that they also have larger radii , such that their surface gravities are very similar .",
    "observations of the ten calibrators were made over eight nights between 23 august 2008 - 29 october 2009 .",
    "observations of the pmos were made on 16 october 2009 .",
    "observations were made using the 8 m gemini telescope at gemini north with nifs  @xcite .",
    "the latter was fitted with the k  band grating , centred at 2.2@xmath2 m .",
    "observations were normally made in an abba pattern to facilitate the removal of the sky background and dark current .",
    "some characteristics of the brown dwarf calibrators and of the observed pmo , together with some observational notes including the s / n range of the nai absorption feature for each object are shown in table 1 .",
    "these ranges were chosen as they are typical of the s / n for each observation .",

    "the reduction was made in three steps : a baseline calibration to produce a shift reference file , a flat field file , a flat bad pixel mask file , a wavelength referenced arc file , and a spatially referenced ronchi file ; a telluric calibration reduction to produce a 1d spectrum of the standard star to be used for telluric calibration of the science data ; and a science data reduction to produce a 3d data cube which has been sky subtracted , flat fielded , cleaned of bad pixels , and telluric corrected .    the first two steps in the reduction process were completed by editing processing scripts supplied by the gemini observatory .",
    "the science reduction also largely followed a gemini script .",
    "however , several additional steps were required to complete the reduction .",
    "in particular , the hydrogen br@xmath18 absorption line at 2.1661@xmath2 m in the spectrum of the standard star chosen for the telluric calibration of each science object had to be removed , the modified spectrum then being divided by the star s blackbody spectrum and normalised before being divided into the extracted 1d science object spectrum to correct the latter for telluric absorption features .",
    "the spectra were extracted using an aperture size of 1.5 times the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of each object , as determined from the dispersed images , see table 1 .",

    "the flux in the sky lines often varied sufficiently during the exposures that the lines were poorly subtracted in the reduction . to remove these lines as well as cosmic ray strikes and the general background ,",
    "the data were processed using our own scripts to subtract the residual background along each column and interpolate across isolated pixels with highly anomalous counts .",
    "care was taken to ensure that the scripts removed only noise features , using a comparison of the many image slices within each dispersed image to distinguish real features from noise .",
    "we used the iraf task continuum to normalise each science spectrum and remove the slope .",
    "we then fitted a second order chebyshev function to define a local pseudo - continuum .",
    "this pseudo - continuum set the flux level for measuring the equivalent widths of spectral features .",
    "while we experimented with higher - order fits , none differed significantly from the second - order fit .",
    "for this reason , the flux level of the pseudo - continuum was excluded as a source of error when we came to determine the uncertainties in our measurements . to obtain a representative pseudo - continuum ,",
    "the fit excluded the nai lines and the co absorption bands starting at 2.29@xmath2 m .",
    "generally , the wavelength range for the fit was from 2.1@xmath2 m @xmath19 2.2@xmath2 m , and 2.21@xmath2 m @xmath19 2.29@xmath2 m .",
    "as a pseudo - continuum was used to measure these equivalent widths , they are more accurately referred to as pseudo - equivalent widths ( pews ) .",
    "spectral features were deblended using the iraf task splot and the pews derived by fitting voigt functions to the deblended lines .",
    "the extracted 1d spectra of nine brown dwarf calibrators are shown in figure 1 .",
    "all spectra were smoothed using three pixel boxcars .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     among the calibrators , one 1 - 2  myr object ( kpno - tau  12 ) has a h@xmath3(k ) value @xmath7 1 , implying a negative slope ( if only slightly ) .",

    "this is consistent with this object s nai pew .",
    "one should not use a single age / gravity indicator to infer the values of either of these quantities in one object .",

    "while this spread in data values may be due to differing formation mechanisms and/or accretion histories , it can also result from an age spread in the @xmath1  orionis cluster .",
    "although the onc pmo 152@xmath6717 is not one of our brown dwarf calibrators , the object s data were obtained in this observation and we think it is appropriate to discuss the results here . while the s / n of the extracted spectrum was too low to allow us to measure the nai pew , we were able to calculate its h@xmath3(k ) index . with a value of 0.914@xmath200.013 ,",
    "152@xmath6717 s h@xmath3(k ) index is consistent with 152@xmath6717 being a low gravity object .",
    "its value is also consistent with the values of the h@xmath3(k ) indices for the other onc pmos in the extended dataset ( see section 7 and table 6 ) .",
    "this highlights an important benefit of this method of constraining the surface gravity , and hence age , of these objects . since the h@xmath3(k )",
    "index is obtained by sampling the slope of the k  band , this technique allows us to obtain indications of surface gravity using spectra which are too noisy or where @xmath21 is too low to resolve narrow spectral features .",
    "the objects in our sample of brown dwarf calibrators are of a similar spectral type .",
    "they differ most significantly in age , and therefore in surface gravity .",
    "molecular hydrogen is the most abundant constituent of brown dwarf atmospheres and h@xmath10 cia is positively correlated to density . at any given metallicity , objects with greater surface gravity will show enhanced h@xmath10 cia .",
    "h@xmath10 absorption in the k  band has been examined before ( @xcite , hereafter t99 ) .",
    "t99 defined two parameters .",
    "the first parameter , k1 , measures the slope of the spectrum between 2.00@xmath2 m and 2.14@xmath2 m .",
    "the second parameter , k2 , measures the strength of h@xmath10 absorption between 2.14@xmath2 m and 2.24@xmath2 m .",
    "t99 suggested that the k2 parameter could be used to estimate an object s t@xmath22 .",
    "they did not apply this index to constrain an object s age other than to say that the k2 parameter was generally negative for field dwarfs . in a subsequent survey of young cluster members ,",
    "the k2 parameter was typically positive ( l08 ) .    to further examine the effect of h@xmath10 cia on the shape of the k  band",
    ", we used newly computed models of h@xmath10 cia in the atmospheres of late - type brown dwarfs to generate synthetic spectra at t@xmath23  2200k ( the typical t@xmath22 of an m9.5@xmath6l0 dwarf ) , over a range of surface gravities from log  g  @xmath24  3.5@xmath255.5 [ s12 ] .",
    "the results are shown in figure 5 .",
    "these saumon & marley models assume that the dwarfs atmospheres are cloudy @xmath26 and of solar metallicity .",
    "the models show a change of slope in the region 2.16@xmath2 m - 2.28@xmath2 m , with the slope decreasing with increasing gravity .",
    "they predict that the rate of change of the slope increases with increasing gravity .",
    "they also predict that the spectra should show greatest sensitivity to the increasing contribution of cia h@xmath10 to the opacity of the atmosphere in the k  band at log g  @xmath7  4.5 , rather than at the lower gravities expected in pre - main sequence clusters .",
    "the data imply a stronger dependence of cia h@xmath10 opacity on gravity than the models predict , particularly at log g  @xmath4  4.5 .    in figure 6 , we used lyon dusty isochrones  ( @xcite ;  @xcite ) to estimate the surface gravities of our brown dwarf calibrators ( see section 8.1 ) .",
    "we took the mean surface gravity for each age group of brown dwarf calibrators , and assigned to that gravity the mean h@xmath10(k ) index for that age group .",
    "we then plotted the saumon & marley 2200k model h@xmath3(k ) indices as a function of surface gravity , fitted a simple polynomial to the data points and interpolated between the points to determine the values of the model h@xmath3(k ) indices at the surface gravities of the brown dwarf calibrators .",
    "we repeated the procedure using an extended dataset ( seen section 7 ) , and found a similar relationship between data and models .",
    "the disparity between models and data at lower gravities is clear .",
    "the changes in the h@xmath10(k ) index at lower gravities are much larger for the data than for the models .",
    "it may be that the models overestimate the significance of dust opacity at these lower gravities .",
    "it is possible that young objects can have higher t@xmath22 than field dwarfs of the same spectral type  @xcite .",
    "this higher t@xmath22 may prevent dust condensation , allowing h@xmath10 cia opacity to play a greater role .",
    "the degeneracy in the data at log g @xmath55 may be due to the very low resolution ( r  @xmath0  50 ) of the data point at log g  @xmath24  4.90 ( teide 1 , a pleiades object from the extended dataset ( see section 7 ) ) .",
    "it is also possible that the h@xmath10(k ) index becomes saturated at log g  @xmath27  5 .",
    "while this behaviour is not shown by the model spectra , we note that the other pleiades objects in the extended dataset , hii 1248b and bpl 62 , have h@xmath10(k ) indices of 1.068 and 1.138 respectively .",
    "we assume that these objects have similar surface gravities .",
    "if the h@xmath3(k ) index does saturate at these values of log g , this would imply an upper limit on the age sensitivity of the index .",
    "figure 7 shows a strong correlation between the nai pews and the h@xmath10(k ) indices calculated from our dataset of brown dwarf calibrators and from the saumon & marley 2200k models . the strength of gravity - sensitive neutral alkali metal lines is a well - proven method in establishing the ages of late - type m  dwarfs .",
    "this correlation suggests that the h@xmath10(k ) index is at least as good an age indicator .",
    "( see section 9 for a more detailed comparison of the two age indicators . )",
    "( k ) indices of our original dataset ( triangles ) , the extended dataset ( squares ) and the model h@xmath10(k ) indices .",
    "the observed dependence of the h@xmath3(k ) index as a function of gravity appears to be substantially steeper than predicted by the models at low surface gravities . ]",
    "( k ) indices for our original dataset ( triangles , solid line ) and the saumon & marley model spectra ( circles , dashed line ) .",
    "note that we have used the means of these values for the original dataset . ]        in cases of unresolved binarity , emission from a disc , non - sphericity , etc , the k  band may exhibit a flux excess , affecting the h@xmath3(k ) index . a common cause of k  band flux excess in young objects is emission from a dusty accretion disc .",
    "to examine the effect of dust emission on the k  band of a typical 1 - 2  myr calibrator ( kpno - tau  4 ) , it was assumed that half the calibrator s flux was produced by dust , simulated by a blackbody function .",
    "this is the level of contamination we would expect to find in the k band spectra of very dusty objects .",
    "we performed two simulations of the blackbody function , at 900k and 1200k respectively , see figure 8 .",
    "the 1200k blackbody spectrum peaks at @xmath52.4@xmath2 m . the combined 1200k blackbody and science object spectrum ( dotted line ) peaks at @xmath52.25@xmath2 m , relatively close to kpno - tau  4 s peak flux ( solid line ) . the blackbody spectrum is flatter near its peak so adding a large component of this flux to the spectrum of kpno - tau  4 causes the latter to similarly flatten , increasing its h@xmath3(k ) index .",
    "the 900k blackbody spectrum peaks at @xmath53.2@xmath2 m .",
    "the combined 900k blackbody and science object spectrum ( dashed line ) peaks at @xmath52.28@xmath2 m .",
    "this has the opposite effect , steepening kpno - tau  4 s spectrum and decreasing its h@xmath3(k ) index .",
    "the h@xmath3(k ) index samples the k band flux , the region of the near infrared most susceptible to contamination by dust emission . while the effect of contamination by dust emission is somewhat mitigated by the narrow baseline ( 0.07@xmath2 m ) over which the index is calculated ,",
    "the emission from the dusty objects simulated in figure 8 does alter the h@xmath3(k ) index of kpno - tau  4 by @xmath280.02 .",
    "while this is significant , we note that the presence of such large amounts of emission from a dusty disc becomes obvious in the spectrum ( see figure 8) , so that such objects can be excluded when calculating an average h@xmath3(k ) index for a population .",
    "the h@xmath3(k ) index will be affected by extinction .",
    "for example , assuming @xmath29 magnitudes , the h@xmath3(k ) index of a noiseless model spectrum decreases from 0.97 to 0.95 .",
    "however , in most cases it will be possible to deredden a spectrum accurately , thereby minimising the effect .",
    "( k ) index .",
    "randomly generated noise was added to a model spectrum ( @xmath30 2200k , log g = 5.5 ) . ]",
    "we carried out a monte carlo analysis to examine the effect of noise on the h@xmath3(k ) index .",
    "we chose a noiseless model spectrum and added successively larger fractions of noise .",
    "the noise was added randomly to each pixel of the model spectrum , at the spectral resolution of our nifs spectra .",
    "after 10@xmath31 iterations of each stage we measured the mean absolute change in the h@xmath3(k ) index .",
    "the results are shown in figure 9 .",

    "we compared the mean h@xmath3(k ) index for the 1 - 2 myr objects in the extended dataset with that of the upper sco objects and derived a 3.37@xmath1 confidence that these objects are from separate populations .",
    "the confidence level increased to 3.96@xmath1 when we compared the means of the 1 - 2 myr objects with those of the pleiades objects in our sample .",
    "the pleiades have a wide scatter due to one object .",
    "this scatter could be reduced with the addition of more high quality k band spectra .",
    "these results suggest that the h@xmath3(k ) index is more gravity - sensitive than the nai pew .",
    "we have shown that the mean h@xmath3(k ) index can change significantly between 1 - 2 myr clusters and clusters @xmath2710 myrs .",
    "it therefore appears to be more gravity - sensitive at very young ages than the triangular h - band continuum which is found in cluster objects with ages @xmath38 5 myr and in young field dwarfs , but which can persist for several tens of myr ( a07 ) .",
    "the h@xmath3(k ) index is applicable to lower resolution spectra .",
    "this has allowed us to suggest that the pmo in our original dataset has low surface gravity . since narrow spectral features were not resolved in the spectrum of this pmo , this would not have been possible had we depended only on the nai pew of the object .    we conclude that the h@xmath3(k ) index is a more sensitive age indicator .",
    "the k  band slope is a good indicator of an object s surface gravity , provided the object has solar metallicity .",
    "while most nearby star formation regions tend to have solar metallicity , individual objects metallicities should be taken into account when considering the object s surface gravity .",
    "we have defined a new spectral index , h@xmath3(k ) , which is a good indicator of surface gravity , particularly for the youngest sources ( 1 - 10  myr ) , where it is more sensitive to surface gravity than the triangular h  band peak . it is at least as good as the equivalent width of the 2.21@xmath2 m nai doublet in differentiating the surface gravities of late - type objects , and does so with less scatter and without the need for high - resolution spectra .",
    "this has allowed us to examine other datasets , obtaining similar results to those obtained from our own brown dwarf calibrators .",
    "all datasets show some scattering of h@xmath3(k ) indices within a cluster . considering the uncertainties associated with the data ,",
    "it is unclear whether or not this scatter reflects a genuine spread of ages .    we have shown that the h@xmath3(k ) index and the ew of the 2.21@xmath2 m nai doublet can find the difference , at least statistically , between a population of @xmath51  myr objects and field dwarfs .",
    "in addition , the h@xmath3(k ) index can statistically differentiate a population of @xmath51  myr objects and a population of @xmath510  myr objects .",
    "the h@xmath3(k ) index can also be used to separate low - mass members from foreground and background objects in young clusters and associations .    by comparing the h@xmath3(k ) indices of 152@xmath6717 and the onc pmos from l06 to the h@xmath3(k ) indices of our 1 - 2  myr calibrators",
    ", we infer that , on average , the onc pmos and our 1 - 2  myr calibrators have a similar age .    the @xmath1  orionis objects h@xmath3(k ) indices and nai pews are consistent with one object being significantly younger than the others .",
    "if true , this would indicate a variation of ages within the cluster , rather than suggesting that the older objects are not cluster members .",
    "indeed , if these objects were contaminants , they could only be much older field objects , and this is clearly not the case .    given the differences in h@xmath3(k ) index among the pleiades objects and that some of their spectra have quite low s / n in the k band , it would be worthwhile obtaining higher s / n k band spectra of objects in clusters with well constrained ages so that these surface gravity indicators can be investigated .",
    "we have shown that it is not necessary to have high - resolution spectra of these objects to be able to constrain the size of their population in young clusters and the low - mass end of the imf .",
    "we now have two gravity - sensitive methods of differentiating late - type dwarfs , the ew of neutral alkali metal lines and the h@xmath3(k ) index , both of which show good correlations with age and which will allow researchers to ascribe statistical ages to samples of brown dwarfs in pre - main sequence clusters .",
    "these can then be used to distinguish between planetary mass objects and somewhat older brown dwarfs with a similar luminosity and temperature .",
    "an object of future research is to determine the extent to which scatter in these measures of surface gravity is due to an age spread .",
    "we thank the referee for their helpful comments and suggestions .    this paper is based on observations obtained in programmes gn-2008b - q-20 and gn-2009b - q-57 at the gemini observatory , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy inc .",
