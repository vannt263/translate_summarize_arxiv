    "quantum effects in transport phenomena in classical systems represent an interesting fundamental issue in quantum theory that started from a remark of einstein in his celebrated paper on torus quantization @xcite .",
    "one of such effects , widely studied in the context of time - periodic systems , is the quantum suppression of classical chaotic diffusion @xcite , or dynamical localization ( dl ) for short .",
    "remarkably , this effect is a quantum manifestation of the fact that a time - periodic force can stabilize a system , and it is thus expected to play a key role in our understanding of the problem of quantum - classical correspondence in classically chaotic systems @xcite . while it is natural to think that , with the period fixed , this effect must depend on the temporal rate at which energy is transferred from the driving mechanism to the system , i.e. , on the force waveform",
    ", the main target of study up to now has only been their dependence on the force amplitude because of the traditional use of sinusoidal forces .",
    "recent work has provided strong evidence for a different dependence of dl on sinusoidal and square - wave forces @xcite . since there are infinitely many different waveforms , a natural question arises : how can the influence of the shape of a periodic force on dl be quantitatively characterized . in this work",
    ", we demonstrate that for space - periodic systems subjected to a generic ac time - periodic force with equidistant zeros such characterization is well provided by a single quantity : the _ impulse _ transmitted by the force over half - period hereafter called _ force impulse_. this impulse is a quantity that accounts simultaneously for the force s amplitude , period and waveform .    the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "as it can be seen , the numerical results confirm that one needs larger values of the modulation amplitude @xmath6 to obtain a noticeable dl as the force impulse ( as a function of @xmath11 ) decreases from its maximum value at @xmath84 .",

    "[ fig.1](b ) ] .",
    "although not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] , the three plotted quantities vanish in the limit @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , it is also important to remark the excellent agreement that exists between the chaotic layer width and the force impulse , that nearly coincide when adequately scaled . thus , we can unambiguously conclude the correlation existing between these two quantities characterizing , respectively , the degree of chaoticity of the system and the ac force .    to further demonstrate the influence of the modulation waveform on dl , we show psoss for three different representative values of  @xmath11 in fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] ( top panel ) .",
    "these psoss have been stroboscopically computed at times multiples of the force period @xmath93 .",
    "one sees that the modulation waveform , and hence the force impulse , does not only have a great influence on the the dl strength , but also on the phase space structures of the system .",
    "thus , for @xmath21 a value of @xmath11 for which dl clearly occurs there are only very tiny islands of regularity ( leftmost panel ) , which are drastically reduced over the range of maximum strength of dl , as for @xmath94 for example ( central panel ) .",
    "finally , for values of @xmath11 which are sufficiently close to 1 , as for @xmath95v(rightmost panel ) , dl is very weak , while the area occupied by regularity islands becomes even larger as @xmath29 .",
    "clearly , this confirms the predicted dl scenario .          in this section",
    "we show how the quantum dynamics of our system , as it happens in general , is dramatically influenced by the underlying classical structures and , as a consequence , by the modulation waveform . to demonstrate this effect , we calculate qsoss for some representative values of the shape parameter @xmath11 . similarly to the classical psoss , we stroboscopically computed these qsoss at multiples of the force period , @xmath96 , using the husimi quasi - probability distribution @xcite    @xmath97    with @xmath98 .",

    "the qsos over the times used in the calculation of the corresponding classical psos , we can quantum mechanically _ unfold _ the phase space structure of the system , which consists of a mix of islands of regularity and regions of stochasticity .",
    "moreover , this averaged qsos can be directly compared with the corresponding classical psos .",
    "some results for different representative values of the parameter @xmath11 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] ( bottom panels ) , where the qsoss after averaging over 50 modulation periods for a coherent state centered at ( @xmath100 are depicted .",
    "this initial condition gives rise to a classically chaotic trajectory .",
    "one sees that , the three qsoss appear all spread out over the corresponding chaotic regions of phase space . also notice how the probability density does not enter into the regions where the motion is regular , since the corresponding tori and resonant islands act as total barriers both for the classical motion and the flow of quantum probability across .",
    "this effect is clearly more noticeable as @xmath11 is increased , i.e.  when larger portions of phase space become regular . as a consequence ,",
    "the qsoss mimic to a great extend the corresponding classical psoss .",
    "one point is worth mentioning here .",
    "if we had propagated the initial wave functions for a much longer time , the corresponding qsoss would have entered to some extend inside these regions of regularity due to the usual quantum tunneling .",
    "let us consider now the quantum dynamics associated with other types of classical motion .",
    "when the wave function is initially localized at a point associated with a regular classical trajectory , whose dynamics is then confined to the corresponding invariant tori or chain of islands , the quantum quasiprobability density behaves accordingly , thus remaining well localized in the neighborhood of the tori ( except , again , for very long times when quantum tunneling becomes noticeable ) .     for @xmath95 .",
    "the corresponding classical poincar surface of section has been represented superimposed in green dots .",
    "the number at the top right corner of each panel indicates the elapsed time in units of the modulation period @xmath96 . ]",
    "an example is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig.5 ] , where we show the qsos corresponding to a wave function for @xmath95 and @xmath101 .",
    "this initial condition generates a classical trajectory in the chain of islands associated with a 7:3 resonance ( see the corresponding psos in fig .  [ fig.5 ] ) .",
    "one sees that the localized wave function jumps over three of the islands at the instants @xmath102 and returns close ( although with some accumulated delay ) to the initial position at @xmath103 .",
    "note that this is the behavior expected from the dynamics associated with the 7:3 classical resonance .    .",
    "all the panels have been ( stroboscopically ) averaged over  50@xmath19 , except panels ( a ) and ( d ) , which have been averaged over @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively . ]",
    "it is worth noting that if we add all the qsoss distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.5 ] and renormalize the total , we get a new distribution highly localized on the corresponding classical psos .",
    "this total distribution is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig.6](a ) , where the described effect is clearly visible .",
    "figures  [ fig.6](b)-(f ) show similar results for qsos localized on other relevant regular structures existing in the classical psos of fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] for @xmath95 . for this purpose ,",
    "we have used wave functions launched at suitable initial conditions in phase space , and we have ( stroboscopically ) averaged the obtained qsos over  50@xmath19 .",
    "one sees that these averaged qsos appear respectively localized on a tori around the central fixed point @xmath106 [ fig .",

    "in all cases , the qsoss completely mimic the structure of the classical phase space .",
    "this clearly demonstrates the importance of this classical structures for the quantum motion .",

    "this principle , which can be straightforwardly applied to other phenomena , such as field - induced barrier transparency  @xcite or quasi - energy band collapse  @xcite , paves the way for optimum coherent control of diverse quantum systems .",
