    "it is expected that the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) will usher in a new era for gravitational - wave ( gw ) astronomy .",
    "the galactic stellar - mass compact binaries are highly promising sources for lisa .",
    "these are also excellent sources to do astrophysics with lisa , which requires accurate extraction of astrophysical informations from gravitational waves they emit ; the real goal of gw astronomy .",
    "accurate extraction of astrophysical quantities associated with compact binaries is possible , in principle , as the dynamics of these sources , when gravitational waves they emit enter lisa s bandwidth , is very accurately described by the post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation to general relativity .",
    "the pn approximation allows one to express the equations of motion of a compact binary as corrections to the newtonian equations of motion in powers of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the characteristic orbital velocity , the total mass , and the typical orbital separation of the binary , respectively .    an important feature of stellar - mass compact binaries , relevant for lisa , consisting of neutron stars , stellar - mass black holes or a mixture of both may be that they will have non - negligible eccentricities , as demonstrated by several astrophysically motivated investigations @xcite",
    "let us first consider a recent investigation that clearly demonstrated that a natural consequence of an asymmetric kick imparted to neutron stars at birth is that the majority of neutron - star ( ns ) binaries should possess highly eccentric orbits @xcite .",
    "@xcite also pointed out that their conclusions are applicable to black - hole  neutron - star ( bh  ns ) and black - hole  black - hole ( bh  bh ) binaries .",
    "further , the observed deficit of eccentric short period binary pulsars was attributed to selection effects , in pulsar surveys , mainly due to the accelerated decay of these binaries @xcite . in another investigation , assuming a stationary distribution for ns - ns binaries in the galaxy , it was argued that lisa will see several ns ",
    "bh and bh  bh binaries in eccentric orbits @xcite . in another investigation that employed monte carlo simulations to model galactic globular clusters , it was observed that lisa may see several stellar - mass bh binaries in highly eccentric orbits @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to have accurate and efficient gw templates for stellar - mass compact binaries in eccentric orbits .",
    "this is because lisa observations of such compact binaries should provide at least the total mass of these binaries @xcite , angular resolution sufficient to identify their location @xcite and , in principle , a bound for the mass of gravitons @xcite .    in this paper , we provide accurate and efficient gw polarizations which are restricted to the quadrupolar order , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , associated with compact binaries , modeled to consist of non - spinning point masses , moving in precessing eccentric orbits .",
    "these templates , which should be useful for lisa , are accurate as we employ the fully 1pn accurate orbital motion .",
    "they are efficient as we provide efficient numerical prescriptions to obtain both time and frequency domain representations for the relevant @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we restricted the orbital motion to be fully 1pn accurate and neglected higher pn contributions for the following two reasons .",
    "the first one is that the investigations , @xcite , that we want to improve ( both in accuracy and efficiency ) do not ( and can not ) even treat the orbital motion in a fully 1pn accurate manner .",
    "the second reason is that for stellar - mass compact binaries in eccentric orbits , whose orbital frequency is @xmath7 hz , it is more important to include the frequency shift due to the periastron advance ( which appears at the 1pn order ) compared to the shift caused by the radiation reaction , appearing at the 2.5pn order @xcite .",
    "moreover , the methods we introduce here to construct numerically efficient templates can be , in principle , incorporated into the phasing formalism that gave @xmath5 and @xmath6 with fully 3.5pn accurate orbital motion @xcite .    the paper is organized in the following way . in section",
    "[ phasing ] , we introduce relevant expressions for the 1pn accurate orbital dynamics and the associated @xmath5 and @xmath6 , required to construct the templates .",

    "the pictorial depictions of our results and associated detailed discussions are given in section [ discussions ] , followed by a brief summary .",

    "this allows us to adapt the most efficient and accurate ( numerical ) way of solving the classical ke @xcite .",
    "we introduce mikkola s solution in the next section .",
    "the celebrated ke has enticed several generations of distinguished scientists roughly from 1650 onward and , therefore , a plethora of solutions exists [ see @xcite for a detailed review ] .",
    "even though with the help of fast computers it is easy to obtain accurate and quick solutions to the ke , there exist subtle points associated with the accuracies and efficiencies of various numerical solutions .",
    "a numerical solution to the ke usually employs newton s method which requires an initial guess @xmath45 that depends on @xmath43 and @xmath46 .",
    "a number of iterations will be required to obtain an approximate solution that has some desired accuracy .",
    "the number of iterations to reach this accuracy naturally depends on @xmath45 , @xmath44 and @xmath43 .",
    "it is therefore compelling to ask , as done for the first time by e. schubert in 1854 , if there exists a clever choice for @xmath45 , such that with one iteration of newton s method one would achieve the desired accuracy for all @xmath44 and @xmath43 . in 1987 , seppo mikkola devised a clever empirical procedure which gives @xmath23 with a relative error @xmath47 , that may be treated to be one of the closest solutions to the puzzle posed by schubert . in this paper",
    ", we employ mikkola s simple and robust solution to solve the 1pn accurate ke and , therefore , obtain @xmath48 and @xmath49 with 1pn accurate orbital evolution . as",
    "mikkola s solution is crucial to obtain highly efficient 1pn accurate phasing , let us briefly describe below mikkola s procedure .    in order to obtain an efficient prescription for @xmath45 ( an initial guess for @xmath23 ) , mikkola introduced an auxiliary variable @xmath50 , allowing one to write our ke as @xmath51 truncating @xmath52 to the third order leads to the following approximate ke @xmath53 the solution to the above cubic equation in @xmath54 can be expressed as @xmath55 where    @xmath56    @xmath57 being + @xmath58    and the sign of the square root is to be chosen to be that of  @xmath43 .",

    "it is important to note that @xmath61 , which enjoys maximum relative error that is not greater than @xmath64 , is obtained without employing a single evaluation of trigonometric functions .",
    "following mikkola , our transcendental equation , namely the 1pn accurate ke , also requires evaluation of just one square root and one cubic root for its solution . to improve @xmath61",
    ", one needs to apply a fourth - order extension of newton s method , available in @xcite .",
    "this requires us to define @xmath65 and its first four derivatives with respect to @xmath23 , evaluated at @xmath66 .",
    "this leads to a solution to our ke that has a relative error not greater than @xmath67 , which reads @xmath68 where    @xmath69    it is important to note that the method requires reduction of @xmath43 into the interval @xmath70 in order to make @xmath54 as small as possible .",

    "this leads to @xmath84 , which is based on the fact that at the fixed points of ke , @xmath85 .",
    "let us now point out another way of tackling the largest error associated with @xmath86 , without resorting to the introduction of @xmath87 .. ] the idea is to choose the coefficient of @xmath88 in the taylor expansion for @xmath52 , such that eqs .",
    "( [ aux_ke ] ) and ( [ cubic_ke ] ) become identical at @xmath86 .",

    "( [ hx_dec ] ) and ( [ hpsimple_dec ] ) rather than using eqs .",
    "( [ wavesbsx ] ) .",

    "( [ wavesbsx ] ) .    in the next section",
    ", we present our results and explain their salient features .",
    "let us begin by presenting several plots that depict our computations . in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , we present scaled @xmath173 and @xmath174 ( @xmath120 and @xmath175 ) for stellar - mass compact binaries ( @xmath176 ) for various eccentricities when @xmath177hz and @xmath178 . the associated normalized power spectrum is also displayed in figs .  [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "we clearly see , as expected , as we increase the value of @xmath46 , higher harmonics with appreciable strengths appear and the total power gets distributed among several frequencies .",
    "the burst nature of the gw signal at high eccentricities indicates the strong emission of gravitational waves near the periastron due to higher relative velocity around the periastron .",
    "another point to note is that spectral lines are all apparently at multiples of radial orbital frequency @xmath179 and we do not observe the effect of periastron advance in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "recall that the periastron advance causes splitting and shifting of spectral lines compared to the newtonian case .",
    "however , in our cases , the shifting of lines from their ( newtonian ) positions is too small to be visible in our graphs .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath36 , characterizing the periastron advance , is @xmath180 for @xmath181 and @xmath182 for @xmath183 [ for @xmath25 @xmath184hz and @xmath185 .",
    "the frequency shift caused by @xmath36 , deducible from the previous section , is @xmath186 and in the case of our stellar - mass binaries this is @xmath187hz for @xmath188 and @xmath189hz for @xmath190 .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to expect that one year lisa observation , which can lead to frequency resolution @xmath191hz , should be sensitive to @xmath36 and hence its effect can not be neglected in the search templates .",
    "it is also straightforward in our prescription to drop the effect of @xmath36 , which can be achieved by neglecting 1pn corrections to the orbital dynamics given in section [ phasing ] .",
    "we display table [ lowecc ] to show that the periastron advance creates closely spaced triplets of spectral lines , corresponding to different values of @xmath192 , which are not visible in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig6 ] .",
    "though triplets are created , one of them really dominates the other two in strength .",
    "further , the dominant one always corresponds to the lowest possible @xmath192 value for that particular triplet . in another set of plots ( figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] ) , we examine the effect of orbital inclination on @xmath99 and its normalized power spectrum .",
    "we observe that the influence of @xmath18 is more visible in the temporal evolution rather than in the associated frequency spectrum .",
    "we do not display similar plots for @xmath98 as its simple dependence on @xmath18 , defined by @xmath16 , is clearly visible in eq .",
    "( [ wavesbsx ] ) .",

    "[ fig7 ] we infer that the above mentioned ratio is rather independent of eccentricity and can be used to estimate the value of @xmath18 .",
    "let us now discuss why our prescription to compute @xmath41 and @xmath40 is superior to what is available in the literature ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    ", though the orbital motion is newtonian accurate , the effect of periastron advance was introduced by hand",
    ". this was achieved by imposing that the periastron advance causes the relative position of the observer to change in a uniform manner with respect to the semi - major axis of the orbit .",
    "this leads to certain ad - hoc splitting and shifting of the spectral lines .",
    "further , the effect of periastron advance and the newtonian accurate orbital dynamics , available in @xcite , do not require to specify the individual masses @xmath193 and @xmath194 , but only the total mass @xmath195 .",
    "however , our fully 1pn accurate orbital description demands @xmath195 and @xmath196 and hence the specification of @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "@xcite , while neglecting the imposed effect that mimics the true periastron advance , employed newtonian accurate orbital motion and an approximate analytic expression for the bessel functions required to compute the infinite series appearing in the temporal evolution for @xmath41 and @xmath40 .",
    "recall that @xmath197 and @xmath198 , bessel functions of the first kind and their first derivatives , available in @xcite and @xcite , arise from the fourier analysis of the classical ( newtonian accurate ) keplerian motion .",
    "while comparing our computations with those presented in @xcite and @xcite , we realized that eqs .",
    "( 13 ) of @xcite give correct circular limit @xcite for @xmath41 and @xmath40 .",
    "however , eqs.(6 ) and ( 7 ) of @xcite differ , in the circular limit , from eqs .",
    "( 2 ) , ( 3a ) and ( 4a ) of @xcite by a factor of @xmath199 .",
    "the difference in sign may be associated with the usage of a different set of conventions compared to the one used here and in @xcite .",
    "however , this is not desirable because for the data analysis purposes , @xmath41 and @xmath40 need to be combined with @xmath200 and @xmath201 , the so - called beam - pattern functions of the gw detector @xcite .",
    "the convention , _",
    "i.e. _ , the way of prescribing a triad that specifies the direction and orientation of the binary orbit , is chosen in @xcite and here such that the resulting @xmath41 and @xmath40 can be directly combined with expressions for @xmath200 and @xmath201 , available in @xcite . however , as our approach is semi - numerical , almost analytic investigations of @xcite and @xcite can be used to check our results , especially for small eccentricities .",
    "we restricted comparisons of our results with those of @xcite and @xcite to moderate eccentricities as it is rather difficult and time consuming to compute accurately large number of @xmath202 and @xmath198 , required for high eccentricities .",
    "we find good qualitative agreement with plots available in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that our approach is quite close to the way wahlquist obtained @xmath96 and @xmath95 , with newtonian accurate orbital motion , in the context of spacecraft doppler detection of gravitational waves from widely separated massive black holes @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the ke is expressed in terms of @xmath203 rather than @xmath23 in @xcite and hence inversed trigonometric functions appear in the classical ke [ it is quite subtle to solve the ke expressed in terms of @xmath203 ]",
    ". as expected , our waveforms with newtonian accurate orbital motion , are in excellent agreement with those given in @xcite .",
    "we , therefore , conclude that our fully 1pn accurate prescriptions to compute temporal evolutions for @xmath4 and @xmath3 and their associated power spectra , which do not require the infinite series expansions whose coefficients contain @xmath202 and @xmath198 , are always going to be more accurate and computationally efficient compared to those currently available in the literature .",
    "a rough indicator for the applicability of our waveforms can be obtained by comparing lisa s frequency resolution for one year , @xmath205hz , with the frequency shifts caused by the advance of periastron and radiation reaction .",
    "the frequency shift of any harmonic due to the periastron advance , as explained earlier , reads @xmath206 the radiation reaction also causes a secular drift in @xmath179 and this drift in one year is @xmath207 the above expression is obtained by computing the change in @xmath179 using the leading order orbital averaged contributions to @xmath208 from @xcite .",
    "the rough limits on the applicability of our waveforms are provided by investigating if lisa can resolve the above two frequency shifts .",
    "we provide rough limits on the applicability of our @xmath209 by considering three binary configurations .",

    "we do not recommend the use of ad hoc gravitational waveforms , available in @xcite , as these @xmath220 will not provide any information about @xmath221 and are not computationally efficient as explained earlier .",

    "ns binaries with @xmath222 , @xmath223 and @xmath224hz this is because for such binaries @xmath225 ( 1 year ) and therefore , it is important to have @xmath220 that include effects of gravitational radiation reaction . while treating extremely eccentric binaries at 1pn order , care should be taken so that @xmath226 does not exceed unity .",
    "this is also a limit of applicability of our @xmath227 with 1pn accurate orbital motion .",
    "it should be noted that in all the cases above we assumed that the emitted gravitational waves , in some cases at higher harmonics , are sufficiently strong in amplitudes to be observed by lisa .",
    "a realistic investigation about the advantage and applicability of our @xmath228 is currently under investigation in @xcite .",
    "we provided an accurate and computationally efficient prescription to obtain gw polarizations associated with non - spinning bound compact binaries of arbitrary eccentricity and mass ratio , moving in slowly precessing orbits . in pn description , we restricted the orbital motion to be 1pn accurate and considered only quadrupole contributions to the amplitudes of @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "we employed an accurate ( numerical ) method due to mikkola to solve the relevant ke appearing in our orbital description .",
    "the time domain @xmath41 , @xmath40 and their associated frequency spectrum , provided in this paper , should be required by lisa to detect and analyze gravitational waves from stellar - mass detached compact binaries moving in eccentric and precessing orbits .",
    "therefore , we expect that our accurate and efficient prescription to compute @xmath41 and @xmath40 should be of definite interest to the recently initiated _ mock lisa data challenge _ task force .",
    "it is possible to extend our prescription to include effects due to radiation reaction @xcite , spin - orbit interactions @xcite and amplitude corrections .",
    "many of these projects are currently in progress .",
