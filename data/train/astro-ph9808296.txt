    "mrk  501 was discovered as a source of tev-@xmath0-radiation in 1995 by the whipple group ( quinn et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the observation was confirmed later by the hegra collaboration ( bradbury et al .",
    "@xcite ) . together with two other extragalactic tev @xmath0-ray sources detected so far , mrk  421 ( punch et al .",
    "@xcite ; petry et al .",
    "@xcite ) and 1es  2344 + 514 ( catanese et al .",
    "@xcite ) , mrk  501 belongs to a sub - population of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , the so - called bl lac objects .",
    "flux variability on various time scales , ranging from dramatic flares of mrk  421 in may 1996 with durations of about 1 h ( gaidos et al .",
    "@xcite ) to a state of high flaring activity of mrk  501 which lasted several months ( e.g. protheroe et al .",
    "@xcite ) , is a characteristic feature of the tev emission observed from bl lac objects .",
    "this agrees well with the general properties of bl lac objects  highly variable agns without significant optical line emission , but showing a strong nonthermal ( synchrotron ) component of radiation from radio to x - ray wavelengths ( e.g. urry & padovani @xcite ) .",
    "the correlated flares of bl lac objects in the kev energy band and in the tev energy band , discovered for the first time during simultaneous observations of mrk  421 by the whipple and asca detectors ( takahashi et al .",
    "@xcite ; buckley et al .",
    "@xcite ) , strongly support the commonly accepted view that both components originate in a relativistic jet , with doppler factors @xmath8 , due to synchrotron and inverse compton ( ic ) radiation of the same population of ultrarelativistic electrons ( for a review see e.g. ulrich et al .",
    "@xcite ) . since in the thomson regime",
    "the ic cooling time @xmath9 is proportional to @xmath10 , and since the compton scattering boosts ambient photons with energies @xmath11 up to @xmath12 , the characteristic time of @xmath0-ray emission decreases with energy as @xmath13 .",
    "this explains in a natural way the less dramatic variations of the mev / gev @xmath0-ray fluxes during the kev / tev flares ; the relatively low energy electrons , responsible for the gev ic photons as well as for the optical / uv synchrotron radiation do not respond as rapidly to changes of the physical conditions in the jets as the high energy electrons do .",
    "in addition , the expected hard spectra of ic radiation below 100 gev explain the low fluxes of gev @xmath0-rays from mrk  421 , and their non - detection by egret in the case of mkn  501 and 1es  2344 + 514 .",
    "this implies that the vhe @xmath0-ray region , combined with x - ray observations , is likely to be the most important window of the electromagnetic spectrum to infer the highly non - stationary processes of particle acceleration and their radiation in bl lac objects .",
    "imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope ( iact ) detectors , characterized by large effective detection areas of @xmath14m@xmath15 and an effective suppression of the background of cosmic rays , are well suited to access this very informative `` tev '' channel .",
    "this was convincingly demonstrated by the mkn  501 observations with several cherenkov telescopes located in the northern hemisphere during the extreme activity of the source in 1997 ( protheroe et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    during the first two years after its discovery as a tev @xmath0-ray source , mkn  501 showed rather low fluxes at a level significantly below the crab flux ( quinn et al .",
    "@xcite ; bradbury et al .",
    "@xcite ) . however , in march 1997 the source went into a state of highly variable and strong emission with maximum fluxes roughly 10 times that of the crab . according to the all sky monitor ( asm ) on board the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) ( remillard & levine @xcite ) , the high x - ray activity of the source started in march 1997 and continued until october 1997 .",
    "apparently the period of high activity coincided with the period of the visibility of the source by ground - based optical instruments .",
    "thus it was possible to continuously monitor the source during this extremely bright emission period with several iacts , i.e.   with cat ( barrau et al .",
    "@xcite ) , hegra ( aharonian et al .",
    "@xcite ) , tactic ( bhat et al .",
    "@xcite ) , whipple ( catanese et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and the telescope array ( hayashida et al .  @xcite ) .",

    "the hegra collaboration operates 6 cherenkov telescopes .",
    "a system of at present four telescopes ( telescopes ct3 , ct4 , ct5 , and ct6 ) is used as a single detector for stereoscopic air shower observations ( daum et al .",
    "the two telescopes , ct1 ( mirzoyan et al .",
    "@xcite ; rauterberg et al .",
    "@xcite ) and ct2 ( konopelko et al .",
    "@xcite ) , are currently operated each as independent detectors .",
    "the iact system is characterized by a high sensitivity and excellent spectroscopic capabilities .",
    "the stand alone telescopes ct1 and ct2 have been used to considerably extend the mkn  501 time coverage , in particular during moonshine periods , when the stereoscopic system was not operated .    in this paper ( part i ) the results obtained from the iact system data are presented . the companion paper ( part ii ) describes in detail the results from ct1 and ct2 data .",
    "the basic concept of the iact array is the _",
    "stereoscopic approach _ based on simultaneous detection of air showers by @xmath16 telescopes under widely differing viewing angles . with the stereoscopic technique an angular resolution of 0.1@xmath1 per photon , an energy resolution of @xmath17 per photon , and a suppression of the isotropic cosmic ray background on the trigger level and by image analysis by a factor of the order of 100 is achieved .",
    "thus @xmath0-ray observations with unprecedented signal to noise ratio and excellent spectroscopic capabilities are possible .",
    "furthermore , since a hardware trigger requiring the coincident detection of air showers by at least two telescopes strongly suppresses triggers caused by the night sky background light or by local muons , the energy threshold of a stereoscopic telescopes system is mainly limited by cherenkov photon statistics . as a consequence ,",
    "the iact system achieves an energy threshold as low as 500  gev despite the relatively small size of the telescope mirrors of @xmath18 ( the energy threshold is defined as the energy at which the @xmath0-ray detection rate peaks for crab type spectra with differential photon indices of @xmath19 ) .",
    "the flux sensitivity of the iact system for episodic tev @xmath0-ray phenomena with durations of the order of 1  h is about 1/4  crab50 @xmath0-rays per hour over a flat background of 6 events per hour . ]",
    "( for s/@xmath6=5@xmath7 ) , which corresponds to a @xmath3-flux at 1  tev of @xmath20 .",
    "this energy flux sensitivity combines nicely with the comparable energy flux sensitivities of the current x - ray instruments like asca , bepposax and rxte for the study of the high energy emission of bl lacs , especially of mkn  501 and of mkn  421 .",
    "these two sources proved to release a comparable amount of nonthermal energy in x - rays and in tev @xmath0-rays , with an average energy flux in both channels exceeding @xmath20 . during strong flares of these sources with fluxes up to 10  crab , a 2 minute exposure is sufficient for the iact system to detect a statistically significant @xmath0-ray signal , and a 1  h exposure suffices for a measurement of the differential energy spectrum .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : hardware issues are briefly summarized in section [ hard ] .",
    "analysis methods are presented in section [ system ] .",
    "subsequently , the results concerning the tev-@xmath0-ray emission from mkn  501 in 1997 are discussed . in section [ lightcurve ]",
    "the 1997 light curve of mkn  501 is presented and possible correlations between the flux amplitude and the spectral slope are explored .",
    "the most rapid time scales of flux variability are discussed in section [ variability ] .",
    "the correlation of the tev - fluxes with the kev - fluxes as measured with the rxte all sky monitor are studied in section [ correlation ] .",
    "implications on models of the non - thermal @xmath21radiation from bl lac objects are discussed in section [ discussion ] .",
    "the hegra telescope system consists presently of 4 , in the near future of 5 , identical iacts ",
    "one at the center and 3 ( in future 4 ) at the corners of a 100 m by 100 m square area .",
    "the multi - mirror reflector of each telescope has an area of 8.5 m@xmath15 .",
    "thirty front aluminized and quartz coated spherical mirrors of 60 cm diameter and of 4.9 m focal length are independently mounted on an almost spherical frame of an alt - azimuth mount , following the design of davies and cotton .",
    "each telescope is equipped with a 271 channel camera of 0.25@xmath1 pixel size resulting in an effective field of view of 4.3@xmath1 .",
    "the pmt pulses are fed into trigger electronics and into shapers followed by 120  mhz flash analog - to - digital converters ( fadcs ) . a multilevel trigger demands _ at least two adjacent pixels _ in each of _ at least 2 telescopes _ ( bulian et al .",
    "the topological `` next - neighbor '' condition of two _ adjacent _ pixels reduces the number of night sky background triggers . in the following analysis we use the software trigger condition of at least two telescopes with images with more than 40 photoelectrons .    at the beginning of each night , the camera is flat - fielded using an uv laser at each telescope to illuminate a scintillator via an optical cable .",
    "the scintillator emits a spectrum with peak emission in the near - uv and blue , similar to atmospheric cherenkov light .",
    "an absolute calibration of the system has been performed with a direct laser measurement and a calibrated low - power photon detector ( fra et al .",
    "this measurement has determined the conversion factor from photons to fadc counts with an accuracy of 10% .",
    "the pointing of the telescopes is checked on a regular basis with so called `` point runs '' ( phlhofer et al .",
    "@xcite ) , where a section of the sky surrounding a bright star is scanned .",
    "the pointing of each telescope is inferred from the currents measured in the pmts surrounding the image of the star . after applying the resulting pointing correction function , an effective pointing accuracy of better than 0.01@xmath1",

    "the excess - rate histories computed with 10minute - temporal - bins are shown for two typical nights , i.e.   may 6th/7th and may 9th/10th . here , as well as in the analysis below , the cuts @xmath22 and @xmath23",
    "have been applied .",
    "no strong variability can be seen and a method is needed to decide on the statistical significance of the observed rate variations .    for the systematic search , a method introduced in ( collura and rosner @xcite ) has been used .",
    "it is based on the @xmath24-fitting technique and permits a search on multiple time scales .",
    "it provides easy and straightforward computation of the significances of the detected variabilities . for each night a variability is searched for , using different time bin sizes , by computing the @xmath24-value of a constant model fit to the data , and performing an averaging procedure over the relative location of the data points within these binning schemes .",
    "we use time bins with durations @xmath25 between 10minutes and 2.24 hours ,",
    "i.e.   with @xmath26minutes ) for @xmath27 to 15",
    ". the lower limit on the bin duration is given by the requirement of an expected number of recorded events per bin @xmath285 .",
    "the upper limit is determined by the maximum duration of the mkn  501 observations per night which is in the order of 4h . for each night the bin duration which yields the most significant variability detection is determined and the chance probability @xmath29 for a constant flux to yield a more significant variability is computed using an analytic approximation .",
    "the chance probabilities , actually the @xmath30log@xmath31(@xmath32)-values , for the 51 nights for which sufficient data with zenith angles smaller than 30@xmath1 is available , are shown in figure [ coll01 ] together with the distribution of large @xmath30log@xmath31(@xmath32)-values expected in the absence of flux variability .",
    "the @xmath30log@xmath31(@xmath32)-values distribute as expected in the absence of any variability , except for values near 0 ( chance probabilities near 1 ) and except for values larger than 3 ( chance probabilities smaller than 1 per mill ) .",
    "the deviation at small values derives from the analytical computation of the chance probabilities , and is thus a pure artifact of the method ( see also collura and rosner @xcite ) .",
    "the deviation at large values correspond to two nights , the night of may 8th/9th ( mjd 50576/50577 ) and the night of june 7th/8th , 1997 ( mjd 50606/50607 ) , for which sub - day variability is indicated .    in the case of the first night , the most significant variability has been found with 20minute bins ; in the case of the second night with 67min bins .",
    "the excess rates during the two nights are shown in figure [ coll02 ] . in the night from may 8th to may 9th , 1997 , the @xmath21ray rate oscillated between 3@xmath0/min and 5.4@xmath0/min on a time scale of 1.5 hours .",
    "in the night from june 7th to june 8th , 1997 , the @xmath21ray rate continuously increased from 4.9@xmath0/min to 7@xmath0/min within 2.6h .",
    "the chance probability for a more significant apparent variability at constant flux is computed to be @xmath33 for the first night and @xmath34 for the second night .",
    "taking into account that 51 nights have been searched for variability , the chance probabilities increase to 0.4% for the first night and to 1% for the second night .",
    "the variability detected in these two nights corresponds to an increase / decay constant of about 3  h for the first night and 7  h for the second night .    to summarize , the study of the time gradients of the diurnal fluxes yields smallest increase / decay times of the order of 15h .",
    "the dedicated search for flux variability within individual nights on time scales between 10minutes and several hours yielded weak evidence for variability on time scales of around 5 hours .",
    "a correlation of x - ray and tev fluxes would give clues regarding the emission mechanism . the all sky monitor on board",
    "the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ has been regularly observing bright x - ray sources in the energy range from 2  -  12kev since january 5th , 1996 .",
    "it observed mainly x - ray binaries and a list of initially 10 , and since may 1997 a list of 74 bright active galactic nuclei .",

    "the time histories of the asm flux and the hardness ratio _ counts_(5 - 12.1kev)/_counts_(1.3 - 3.0kev ) , both computed with bins of 1 week duration , are compared to the light curve of the hegra iact - system .",

    "the binned light curves , hardness ratios , and correlation coefficients ( `` slow '' method with error propagation ) have been obtained using the `` ftools 4.0 '' package .    the count rate increases from 0.4/sec in february , 1996 , slowly to 1counts / sec in january , 1997 , and then dramatically to 2counts / sec in june / july 1997 . after reaching its maximum of 3.1@xmath360.4 on june 24th , 1997",

    "the index @xmath44 runs over all nights with tev - measurements , the @xmath45 are the daily tev flux amplitudes , and the @xmath46 are the asm count rates averaged over 24h , centered close to 0:00ut . in figure [ corrfig ] the results are presented .",
    "the dcf shows a positive peak reaching from @xmath47 ( tev variability follows x - ray variability after 1 day ) to @xmath48 ( tev variability precedes x - ray variability by one day ) .",
    "the data indicates a correlation of the tev- and x - ray emission with a time lag of one day or less . for @xmath49 , 50 pairs of tev and x - ray data enter the calculation and give a dcf of 0.37@xmath360.03 .",
    "even completely uncorrelated time series are expected to produce non - zero values of the dcf ( edelson & krolik @xcite ) .",
    "the probability distribution of the dcf depends on the number of pairs used for its calculation and on the temporal autocorrelation characteristics of the tev emission and the x - ray emission . assuming 50 statistically independent flux measurements in two energy bands which follow gaussian distributions around their mean values , the chance probability for dcf - values exceeding 0.37@xmath360.03 is 0.43% . reducing the number of statistically independent flux pairs from 50 to 15 ,",
    "increases this chance probability to 8% .",
    "the true chance probability of the correlation indicated in figure [ 2dcorrfig ] and figure [ corrfig ] will lie between these two extremes .",
    "note , that the same correlation is found in the ct1 data and in the ct2 data ( see part ii ) .",
    "we interpret the structure of the dcf which can be recognized in figure [ corrfig ] as to arise from the periodic gaps in the hegra observation time , paired with the spiky structure of the mkn  501 light curve in both energy bands .",
    "the observations of mkn  501 during its remarkable state of flaring activity in 1997 with the hegra iact system allowed us to study in detail the temporal and spectral characteristics of the source with , for gamma - ray astronomy , unprecedented photon statistics and precision .",
    "more than 38,000 tev @xmath0-ray photons were detected during march 1997 until october 1997 .",
    "these photons enabled the localization of the @xmath0-ray source with an accuracy of about 40 arc seconds .",
    "the mean flux of @xmath0-rays averaged over the whole period of activity was as high as three times the flux of the crab nebula , the strongest persistent tev source in the sky . for a source of this strength ,",
    "even `` loose '' shape cuts result in an almost background free detection of @xmath0-rays : several 100 @xmath0-rays against 20 background events caused by cosmic rays .",
    "this implies the statistically significant detection of the source every few minutes during the whole 6 months of observations and makes it possible to study the flux variability on sub - hour time scales .",
    "furthermore , the good precision of reconstruction of the energy of _ individual _ @xmath0-rays with @xmath2 resolution combined with high @xmath0-ray statistics makes it possible to measure the energy spectra of the radiation and their evolution in time on a night - by - night basis .    in this paper",
    "we presented the results obtained from iact system data .",
    "the data of ct1 and ct2 are described in part ii .",
    "the iact system data has not given any evidence for a correlation between the emission intensity at 2tev and the spectral index , determined between 1 and 5tev .",
    "the study of the time gradient of the diurnal flux at 2tev yielded shortest increase / decay times of the order of 15h .",
    "a dedicated search for short time variability within individual nights yielded evidence for a variability with a corresponding increase / decay time of the order of 5h .",
    "the data indicated a weak correlation between the tev - flux amplitudes and the 2 to 12 kev x - ray flux , fovouring a time lag between the tev- and the x - ray variability of one day or less . in the following",
    "we will briefly discuss these results .",
    "commonly it is believed that the study of the tev @xmath0-ray spectra of bl lac objects at different epochs of their activity provides key insights into the nature of the @xmath0-ray production processes in the relativistic jets .",
    "generally , in these highly dynamical objects , when the flux could be changed by an order of magnitude within 1 day of observations , strong time - variation of the spectral shape of the radiation is expected as well . however , the average spectra of mkn  501 in the energy range from 1tev to 10tev corresponding to largely different absolute flux levels , appear to be very similar as discussed in section [ lightcurve ] ( see figure [ highlowfig ] ) .    in the framework of inverse compton models",
    "this could be interpreted as result of ( 1 ) a time - independent spectrum of accelerated electrons , together with ( 2 ) a very fast radiative cooling of the electrons which establishes an equilibrium spectrum of electrons during the time required for the collection of sufficient photon statistics for proper spectral measurements ( typically a few hours or less if the absolute @xmath0-ray flux exceeds the flux level of the crab ) . at first glance",
    ", this contradicts the observed dramatic shift of the synchrotron peak in the mkn  501 spectrum by 2 orders of magnitude in frequency , discovered with bepposax during the april 1997 flaring phase ( pian et al .",
    "@xcite ) . formally speaking ,",
    "the position of the synchrotron peak @xmath50 is proportional to @xmath51 , henceforth its variation could be explained by the variation of any of the three appropriate parameters - magnetic field @xmath52 , doppler factor @xmath53 , and the maximum energy of accelerated electrons @xmath54 .",
    "however as it was argued by pian et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , the shift of the synchrotron peak during these specific observations could hardly be attributed to the variation of the doppler factor and/or magnetic field , but is caused rather by an increase ( by a factor of 10 or so ) of the maximum energy of accelerated electrons . on these grounds",
    "we may expect a significant hardening of the tev spectrum as well .",
    "however , due to the klein - nishina cross - section , the increase of @xmath54 in the ic spectrum is expected to be substantially less pronounced .",
    "it should be emphasized , that during the whole period of 1997 the source was in a `` high '' state with a tev flux @xmath55 .",
    "it will be of utmost interest to use the iact system to study the mkn  501 spectrum in a really low state , characterized by a tev flux well below one crab unit .",
    "the second interesting feature of the _ flux - selected _ spectra averaged over almost 6 months of observations ( figure [ highlowfig ] ) is their smooth shape with power - law photon index of about @xmath562.25 ( @xmath57 ) at energies between 1 tev and several tev , _ but _ with a gradual steepening at higher energies .",
    "we would like to make a comment concerning the implications of the steepening of the spectrum for the estimates of the diffuse extragalactic background radiation ( debra ) . if one interprets the lack of a cutoff in the @xmath0-ray spectra of both mrk  421 ( zweerink et al .",
    "@xcite ) and mrk  501 ( aharonian et al .",
    "@xcite ) up to 10 tev as an indication for the absence of absorption in the debra , an upper limit on the energy density of debra , @xmath58 at @xmath59 can be derived from the condition of the transparency of the intergalactic medium for 10 tev @xmath0-rays ( weekes et al .",
    "the recent studies of the problem , based on different assumptions about the spectral shape of the debra , give similar results ( stanev & franceschini @xcite ; funk et al .",
    "@xcite ; biller et al .",
    "@xcite ; stecker & de jager @xcite ) .",
    "however , as it was emphasized by weekes et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , the lack of an apparent cutoff in @xmath0-ray spectra does not automatically imply negligible intergalactic absorption .",
    "indeed , some infrared background models , like the _ cold+hot dark matter _ model of macminn & primack ( @xcite ) , predict a _ modulation _ rather than _ cutoff _ in the spectra of mrk  421 and mrk  501 .",
    "the absorption results in a steeper observed spectrum , but even a power - law form could be conserved , at least up to 10  tev .    the general tendency of gradual steepening of the spectra of mrk  501 obtained in this paper could be formally interpreted as a result of absorption in the intergalactic background radiation , which would allow to estimate the density of the debra .",
    "obviously this number could not be far from the above upper limit estimate .",
    "however , care should be taken in the interpretation of these results , since the intrinsic spectra of the source are not properly understood and probably several effects combine to steepen the tev spectra of bl lac objects .",
    "our observations revealed flux variability on time scales @xmath60 of between 5 and 15h . due to causality and light travel time arguments the size of the @xmath0-ray production region can not exceed @xmath61 with @xmath62/10h and where @xmath53 is the doppler factor of the jet .",
    "the condition that the source is optically thin with respect to photon - photon pair production , @xmath63 , results in a _ lower limit _ on the doppler factor of the jet @xmath53 , assuming that the low - frequency photons are produced co - spatially in the quasi - isotropically emitting cloud ( blob ) : @xmath64 ( see e.g. celotti et al .",
    "@xcite ) , where @xmath65 @xmath66 is the observed energy flux of the optical and the infrared photons at the observed energy @xmath67 with width @xmath68 ; @xmath69 is the energy of detected @xmath0-ray photon .",
    "the characteristic fluxes of the optical and the infrared radiation from mkn  501 of about @xmath70 ( see e.g. pian et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and the time variability of the 1 - 10 tev @xmath0-rays within 5 to 15  h obtained above , require a minimum doppler factor in the order of 5 .",
    "due to the weak dependence of @xmath71 on @xmath72 and @xmath60 , we can not expect a further significant strengthening of this lower limit on @xmath53 .    on the other hand , if the tev @xmath0-rays are produced by relativistic electrons which up - scatter their low - frequency synchrotron radiation ( the so - called synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) scenario , see e.g. ghisellini et al .",
    "@xcite ; bloom & marscher @xcite ; inoue & takahara @xcite ; mastichiadis & kirk @xcite ; bednarek & protheroe @xcite ) , the observed time variability of tev @xmath0-rays sets also a strong _ upper limit _ on the doppler factor , if one requires that the synchrotron and compton cooling time of the electrons is smaller than the flux variability time .",
    "indeed , the energy density of the low - frequency target photons in this model is estimated as @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the distance to the source ( @xmath75 for @xmath76 ) , @xmath77 is the size of the @xmath0-ray production region which is limited by equation [ tobs ] , but most probably can not be significantly less than @xmath78 . assuming that the synchrotron and compton cooling time of electrons @xmath79^{-1 }   \\simeq 15\\ , ( ( w_{\\rm r}+b^2/8\\pi)/1 \\ , \\rm erg / cm^3)^{-1 } \\,$ ] @xmath80@xmath81 , where @xmath52 is the magnetic field in the jet , does not exceed the flux variability time ( in the frame of the jet ) @xmath82 , we find @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the ratio of the energy flux emitted in the x - ray band and in the tev band . for characteristic values of @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88  tev , and @xmath89 ( pian et al .",
    "@xcite ) one obtains @xmath90 .    in their different modifications , the inverse compton ( ic ) models of tev radiation of bl lac objects",
    "predict the correlation between the x - ray- and tev - regimes which is indicated in figures [ 2dcorrfig ] and [ corrfig ] .",
    "albeit a correlation x / tev is a strong argument in favor of the common _ electronic _ origin of the parent particles which produce synchrotron x - rays and ic @xmath0-rays , the fact of the correlation alone does not decide definitively between the electronic and hadronic nature of the primary ( accelerated ) particles .",
    "for example in _ proton blazar _ type models ( mannheim @xcite ) , the bulk of the nonthermal emission is produced at later stages of the proton - induced - cascade through the same synchrotron and ic radiation of the secondary ( cascade ) electrons .",
    "in fact , the short time variability of the kev / tev - radiation strongly argues in favor of electronic models . whereas the fast radiative ( synchrotron and ic ) cooling time of the electrons in the jet readily match the observed time - variability on a time scale of some hours , the inelastic hadron interactions , both with ambient gas or photon fields are rather slow processes and only become effective at very high target gas densities and/or photon densities , exceeding significantly the typical values characterizing the @xmath0-ray emitting jets in bl lac objects ( schlickeiser @xcite ; sikora @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , presently the hadronic models can not be ruled out unambiguously on the basis of arguments concerning the time variability of the tev - flux .",
    "the rapid variability can be explained by geometrical effects , e.g. , by anisotropies in the comoving frame of the jet ( salvati et al .",
    "@xcite ) , or in models where the flares occur due to fast moving targets ( gas clouds ) which cross the beam of relativistic particles ( dar & laor @xcite ) .",
