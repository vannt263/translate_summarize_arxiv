    "the study of phase factors arising in quantum interference has been crucial for the understanding of a wide range of physical phenomena @xcite . the aharonov - bohm phase factor @xcite , @xmath1 ,",
    "is acquired by a particle with charge @xmath2 in a looping trajectory that encloses a classical magnetostatic flux @xmath3 . this is true even when the particle moves in entirely field - free regions .",
    "the effect has been investigated in relation to transport phenomena in solid state physics @xcite and electron coherence in mesoscopic devices @xcite .",
    "the reciprocal phase factor @xcite and the dual counterparts @xcite have also been studied and have recently found applications in different contexts , such as topological quantum information processing @xcite , the quantum hall effect analogue with neutral atoms @xcite and ultra - cold atom technology @xcite .    the generalized phase factor , @xmath4 , which is induced on a charge @xmath2 by a nonclassical electromagnetic field with magnetic flux @xmath5 has also been studied in the literature @xcite . in this case",
    "the magnetic flux and the induced phase factor are quantum mechanical operators .",
    "consequently the important quantity in terms of interference properties is the expectation value of the phase factor , @xmath6 $ ] , with respect to the density matrix @xmath7 that describes the external electromagnetic field .",
    "this phase factor is topological in the sense that it depends on the number of times an electron winds around the enclosed magnetic flux and it is independent of the electron velocity .",
    "the @xmath8 is a complex quantity , in general , which is known as the weyl ( or characteristic ) function from quantum phase - space studies @xcite .",
    "clearly the inherent fluctuations of the external quantum fields bring about the problem of decoherence of the interfering electrons .",
    "solutions have been proposed in relation to this problem using various methods @xcite .",
    "here it is assumed that under certain conditions the external photons do not interact with the interfering charges . in particular , it is assumed that the electromagnetic fields that are induced via faraday s law by the circulating electrons are negligible in comparison to the external fields , and so there is no back reaction .",
    "the inherent noise of the external photons manifests itself as a reduction of the absolute value of the phase factor , @xmath9 , which becomes slightly less than one @xcite .",
    "nonclassical electromagnetic fields in various quantum states @xcite , such as squeezed and number states , have been generated at both optical and microwave frequencies @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanically correlated @xcite photons have also been produced in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to enquire whether we can use certain quantum interference devices , which are sensitive to the external radiation , as detectors of photon correlations .",
    "this has indeed been proposed recently using different techniques @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study photon - induced correlations between electron phase factors , which is the precursory mechanism for the detection of photon entanglement in distant quantum interference devices .",
    "it is shown that the phase factors of the electrons in interference experiments , which are initially independent of one another , become correlated when the experiments are irradiated with correlated photons .",
    "the setup considered here may also be useful in the general area of flying and stationary qubits @xcite and their interaction .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "a possible implementation is analyzed and background material is provided in section 2 . the correlations induced by the photons on the phase factors are quantified for the bipartite case in section 3 . the problem is approached through examples , that involve classically and quantum mechanically correlated photons in number states and in coherent states , in section 4 .",
    "this is subsequently generalized to the tripartite case in section 5 , where examples are also provided .",
    "the results are discussed and conclusions are drawn in section 6 .",
    "we begin by introducing the setup depicted in figure 1 : two interference devices for charged particles , * a * and * b * , are placed inside cavities that are far from each other .",
    "a source @xmath10 of two - mode nonclassical microwaves sends one mode of frequency @xmath11 into the cavity where * a * has been placed , and the other mode of frequency @xmath12 into the cavity where * b * has been placed .",
    "it has been shown that in this case the correlation between the two electromagnetic field modes is transferred to the distant quantum interference devices @xcite .",
    "these devices could be , for example , nanoscale superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) @xcite , in which case the interfering particles are cooper pairs ; or simply two - path electron interference devices @xcite . in either case",
    "the value of the phase factor , which depends on the external electromagnetic fields , influences the measurable physical quantities ( in the case of superconducting rings the measurable variable is the current , while in electron interference one measures the intensity of electrons on the interference screen )",
    ".    the external quantum fields are usually described by the vector potential @xmath13 and the electric field @xmath14 , which are dual quantum variables .",
    "the @xmath15 can be transformed into another pair of dual variables by integrating them around a small loop @xmath16 ( that is , ` small ' in comparison to the wavelength so that the field strengths are locally the same ) .",
    "this operation yields the magnetic flux @xmath17 and the electromotive force @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the boson creation and annihilation operators may now be introduced as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a constant proportional to the area enclosed by @xmath16 .",
    "they obey the usual commutation relation @xmath21 = 1 $ ] ( note that we employ units in which the boltzmann constant , the planck constant divided by @xmath22 , and the speed of light in vacuum are set equal to one , @xmath23 ) .",
    "the flux operator is consequently written in the heisenberg picture as @xmath24 where @xmath25 the full hamiltonian @xmath26 contains the free electromagnetic field hamiltonian and an interaction term @xmath27 , which includes the hamiltonian of the interfering charges as well . in this paper",
    "we assume that the @xmath27 , which describes the back reaction from the charges to the electromagnetic field , is neglected .",
    "in other words it is assumed that the self - induced magnetic flux of the charges is negligible compared to the external flux @xmath28 . in this approximation @xcite we get @xmath29.\\ ] ] exponentiating we obtain the phase factor for an electron of charge @xmath30 : @xmath31=d\\left[\\rmi q\\exp(\\rmi \\omega t)\\right ] , \\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; q=\\frac{\\xi \\rme}{\\sqrt{2}}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is introduced as a scaled electric charge .",

    "the reason for this is that the operator @xmath37 is not hermitian , since @xmath38 .    to provide a physical interpretation consider that * a * is a two - path electron interference experiment",
    ". with each path",
    "we associate a wavefunction for the electrons , for example , @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( let us assume equal splitting among them , for simplicity ) . it has been shown elsewhere @xcite that the intensity , or number density , of electrons at position @xmath41 on the interference screen of experiment * a * is given by @xmath42 = 1 + |\\tilde{w}_{\\rm a}(\\lambda_{\\rm a})|\\cos\\{x+\\arg[\\tilde{w}_{\\rm a}(\\lambda_{\\rm a})]\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is clearly seen that the absolute value of the expectation value of the phase factor , @xmath43 , is the visibility @xmath44 of the interference .",

    "in this section we show how the electron phase factors in distant interference experiments become correlated when they are irradiated with correlated photons . the nature of the correlation between the external photons can be classical or quantum @xcite and the aim here is to compare and contrast the two cases . the difference between the two cases is firstly clarified .",

    "however for classically or quantum mechanically correlated subsystems the two - mode weyl function is not equal to this product of one - mode weyl functions , in general .",
    "this implies that the electron phase factors in * a * and * b * are correlated with each other .    in order to quantify the induced correlations between the electron phase factors we define @xmath60 if the subsystems are not correlated with each other then @xmath61 . if they are correlated then @xmath62 ( i.e. , the real and imaginary parts of @xmath63 do not both vanish ) .",

    "<S> the topological phase factor induced on interfering electrons by external quantum electromagnetic fields has been studied . </S>",
    "<S> two and three electron interference experiments inside distant cavities are considered and the influence of correlated photons on the phase factors is investigated . it is shown that the classical or quantum correlations of the irradiating photons are transferred to the topological phases . the effect is quantified in terms of weyl functions for the density operators of the photons and illustrated with particular examples . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme employs the generalized phase factor as a mechanism for information transfer from the photons to the electric charges . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> , the scheme may be useful in the context of flying qubits ( corresponding to the photons ) and stationary qubits ( electrons ) , and the conversion from one type to the other .    </S>",
