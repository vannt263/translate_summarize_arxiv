    "the set of points that are equidistant from two given sets in the plane appears naturally in many classical geometric situations .",
    "namely , the classical conics , defined as the level set of a degree @xmath0 real polynomial equation , can always be realized as the equidistant set to two circles ( see section [ conics_as_midsets ] ) .",
    "the significance of conics for the development of mathematics is incontestable .",
    "each new progress in their study has represented a breakthrough : the determination of the bounded area by archimides , their conception as plane curves by apollonius , their occurrence as solutions for movement equations by kepler , the development of projective and analytic geometry by desargues and descartes , etc . + in other , let us say , less academic field we find equidistant sets as conventionally defined frontiers in territorial domain controversies : for instance , the united nations convention on the law of the sea ( article 15 ) establishes that , in absence of any previous agreement , the delimitation of the territorial sea between countries occurs exactly on the _ median line every point of which is equidistant of the nearest points _ to each country .",
    "the significance of this last situation stresses the necessity of understanding the geometric structure of equidistant sets .",
    "the study of equidistant sets , other than conics , arose many decades ago principally with the works of wilker @xcite and loveland @xcite ( in section [ survey ] we review their main contributions concerning topological properties of equidistant sets ) .",
    "+ in the literature we can find many generalizations of conics .",
    "for instance , gro and strempel @xcite start from the the usual definition of conics as the set of points in the plane that have a constant weighted sum of distances to two points ( the _ focal points _ ) and gave a generalization by allowing more than two focal points , weights other than @xmath1 and point sets in higher dimensions .",
    "recently , vincze and nagy @xcite proposed that a generalized conic is a set of points with the same average distance from a point set @xmath2 . in this work we present equidistant sets as a natural generalization of conics making use of the fact that classical conics are equidistant sets to plane circles ( _ focal sets _ ) .",
    "admitting more complicated focal sets we obtain more complicated equidistant sets ( _ generalized conics _ ) .",
    "our purpose is to show that these generalizations share many geometrical features with their classical ancestors .",
    "for instance , we show that the equidistant set to two disjoint connected compact sets looks like the branch of a hyperbola in the sense that near the infinity it is asymptotic to two rays .",
    "we also discuss possible generalizations of ellipses and parabolas .",
    "additionally we propose some further research directions .",
    "+ computational simulations constitute a useful tool for treating equidistant sets .",
    "this task faces two main theoretic issues .",
    "the first one deals with the fact that a computer manipulate only discrete approximations of plane sets ( limited by the memory or screen resolution ) . in this direction",
    "our result about the hausdorff continuity of equidistant sets ( cf .",
    "theorem [ hausdorff ] ) is central since it implies that the equidistant set computed by the machine approaches ( by increasing the screen resolution or dedicated memory ) to the genuine equidistant set .",
    "the second serious computational issue has to do with the following : remember that the plane is represented on the screen by a finite array of points ( pixels ) . in order to determine precisely what points belong to the equidistant set",
    ", one needs to compute the respective distances to the underlying sets ( focal sets ) and then to decide whether this difference is equal to zero or not . strictly speaking",
    ", a pixel belongs to the equidistant set if and only if this difference vanishes .",
    "nevertheless , due to to the discrete character of this computer screen plane , this absolute zero is virtually impossible .",
    "thus , in order to obtain a good picture of the equidistant set we need to introduce a more tolerant criteria .",
    "the general situation is as follows : one finds a pixel for which the difference of the distances to the focal sets is very small and we ask wether or not this means that we can assume the presence of a point of the equidistant set inside the region represented by this pixel .",
    "theorem [ shadow ] ( the _ shadowing property _ , see the appendix ) provides us with a useful criteria , since it gives a sharp bound on the distance from a quasi - equidistant point to an authentic equidistant point .    [ [ definitions - and - notations . ] ] definitions and notations .",
