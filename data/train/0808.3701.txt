    "based on several astronomical evidences , our universe is currently in a period of positively accelerated expansion [ 1 ] .",
    "it is possible to interpret this late - time acceleration based on yet unknown component called dark energy in literature ( see for instance [ 2 ] with a comprehensive list of references therein ) .",
    "also , it has been shown that such an accelerated expansion could be the result of a modification to the einstein - hilbert action ( for a recent review see [ 3 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , dgp braneworld scenario has the capability to interpret this late - time acceleration via leakage of gravity to extra dimension in its self - accelerating branch [ 4 ] .",
    "for the first alternative , the simplest candidate for dark energy is the cosmological constant itself .",
    "however , it suffers from serious problems such as a huge amount of fine - tuning [ 2,5,6 ] . within dark energy viewpoint , for a dark energy component ,",
    "say @xmath1 , its equation of state or equivalently equation of state parameter @xmath2 , determines both gravitational properties and evolution of the dark energy .",
    "recent constraints on equation of state of dark energy indicate that @xmath3 and even that @xmath4 . when we consider background evolution , there is no problem with @xmath4 .",
    "however , there will be apparent divergencies in perturbation when one crosses the phantom divide line , @xmath5 .",
    "accordingly , crossing of the phantom divide line , @xmath5 , provides a suitable basis to test alternative theories of gravity or higher dimensional models which can give rise to an effective phantom energy [ 6 ] . with these motivations ,",
    "the issue of phantom divide line crossing has been investigated extensively in recent years ( see [ 6 ] and references therein ) . in principle , crossing of phantom divide line by the dark energy equation of state parameter at recent red - shifts , has two possible cosmological implications : either the dark energy consists of multiple components with at least one non - canonical phantom component or general relativity needs to be extended to a more general theory on cosmological scales . both of these conjectures have been studied extensively . for instance ,",
    "curvature quintessence [ 7 ] is a fascinating proposal in this respect .",
    "recently , phantom - like behavior in a brane - world model with curvature effects and also in dilatonic brane - world scenario with induced gravity have been reported [ 8 ] .",
    "dark energy models with non - minimally coupled scalar field and other extensions of scalar - tensor theories have been studied widely some of which can be found in reference [ 9 ] . in the spirit of scalar - tensor dark energy models ,",
    "our motivation here is to show that a general @xmath0 dgp - inspired scenario can account for late - time acceleration and crossing of phantom divide line in some suitable domains of model parameters space . to show this feature , first we study cosmological dynamics of @xmath0 dgp - inspired scenario briefly . in the minimal case , motivated by modified theories of gravity",
    ", some authors have included a term of the type @xmath6 in the action [ 7,10 ] .",
    "this extension for some values of @xmath7 has the capability to explain late - time acceleration of the universe in a simple manner .",
    "it is then natural to extend this scenario to more general embedding of dgp inspired scenarios .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to perform such a generalization to study both late - time acceleration and possible crossing of phantom divide line in this setup .",
    "we focus mainly on the potential of the type @xmath8 for non - minimally coupled scalar field .",
    "our setup for minimal case predicts a power - law acceleration supporting observed late - time acceleration . in the non - minimal case , by a suitable choice of non - minimal coupling and scalar field potential , one obtains accelerated expansion in some specific regions of parameters space .",
    "while a single minimally coupled scalar field in four dimensions can not reproduce a crossing of the phantom divide line for any scalar field potential [ 11 ] , a non - minimally coupled scalar field account for such a crossing [ 6 ]",
    ". in dgp model , equation of state parameter of dark energy never crosses @xmath9 line , and universe eventually turns out to be de sitter phase . nevertheless , in this setup",
    "if we include a single scalar field ( ordinary or phantom ) on the brane , we can show that equation of state parameter of dark energy can cross phantom divide line [ 12 ] .",
    "crossing of phantom divide line with non - minimally coupled scalar field on the warped dgp brane has been studied recently [ 13 ] .",
    "our purpose here is to obtain an extension of these non - minimal dark energy models within dgp - inspired @xmath0 braneworld scenario .",

    "the second term on the right is a generalization of the einstein - hilbert action induced on the brane .",

    "the most important feature of this @xmath0 dgp - inspired scenario is the fact that now cross - over scale is explicitly related to the induced curvature on the brane and non - minimal coupling of scalar field with this curvature . since the dynamics of scalar field @xmath44 is described by @xmath47 , one may explain this result as a spacetime variation of the newton s constant . in this viewpoint ,",

    "now , after a brief study of gravitational and cosmological implications of our setup , we investigate late - time acceleration and crossing of the phantom divide line in this setup .",
    "standard dgp model itself has the capability to explain the late - time acceleration of the universe via leakage of gravity to extra dimensions without any additional mechanism [ 4 ] . in our @xmath0 dgp inspired model , it is interesting to see whether there is any room for explanation of this late time acceleration .",
    "the viability of this question lies in the fact that generally with non - minimal coupling it is harder to achieve accelerated expansion [ 16 ] .",
    "we first obtain a necessary condition for the acceleration of the universe in @xmath0 dgp - inspired model .",
    "then we use a simple ansatz to clarify our general equations .",
    "suppose that scalar field is the only source of matter on the brane so that @xmath87 for other matter candidates .",

    "for instance , if we set @xmath8 , we find @xmath97 . using the ansatz @xmath98 and @xmath99 , equations ( 22 ) and ( 23 ) with  @xmath100 and @xmath87 , give @xmath101 with positive and real @xmath102 and considering terms of order  @xmath103 . in this case",
    "@xmath104  is restricted to the interval  @xmath105 and since equation ( 23 ) with these ansatz gives @xmath106 , positivity and reality of solutions for @xmath107 gives @xmath108 .",
    "for @xmath109 , we find @xmath110 which gives a power - law accelerated expansion for positive sign",
    ". therefore , a suitable fine - tuning of non - minimal coupling provides the possibility of late - time accelerated expansion . based on a dark energy model , to have an accelerated universe ,",
    "the value of conformal nmc should be restricted to the interval  @xmath111 [ 17 ] . on the other hand , current experimental limits on the time variation of @xmath112 constraint the nonminimal coupling as @xmath113[18 ] .",
    "solar system experiments such as shapiro time delay and deflection of light have constraint brans - dike parameter to be @xmath114 which leads to the result of @xmath115 for non - minimal coupling [ 18 ] . however , other approaches lead to different constraints on the value of conformal coupling [ 19 ] . as a second and more general example with @xmath116 correction",
    ", we set  @xmath117 .",
    "for spatially flat frw geometry the ricci scalar is given by @xmath118 using the above proposed ansatz for @xmath119 and @xmath120 , equations ( 22 ) and ( 24 ) can be rewritten as the following explicit time - dependent form @xmath121 @xmath122    @xmath123 @xmath124 @xmath125 our aim is to see whether these equations account for positively accelerated expansion with suitable values of parameters . since the parameter space of the problem is complicated , analytical solutions of these equations have no obvious interpretation .",
    "therefore , we try to see how a suitable choice of parameters leads to viability of accelerated expansion in this setup .",
    "our strategy is to see how with different choices of parameters in equations ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) , equality in this equations is preserved .",
    "firstly , we choose @xmath126 in the favor of late - time positively accelerated expansion .",
    "we find appropriate values of other parameters in this parameters space as shown in table @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "we plot each side of equation ( 27 ) as a separate function of time for some values of parameters .",
    "existence of intersection point for these functions shows the viability of values attributed to parameters to preserve equality .",
    "the same procedure for both sides of equation ( 28 ) is done too . in summary , to have accelerated expansion , we need @xmath126 , so choosing @xmath126 we find some possible values of the other parameters to have at least one intersection point in the graph and therefore to be consistent with accelerated expansion . secondly , choosing some specific values for other parameters , we obtain possible values of @xmath102 .",
    "if there is no intersection between two graphs , it means that with that choice of parameters we will not arrive at @xmath126 corresponding to accelerated expansion . if there is intersection but with @xmath129 , the solution will be decelerating ruled out by observational data .",
    "the results of these analysis are shown in table @xmath127 and @xmath128 and also in figures @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "note that these are only some specific examples and the actual parameter space is very large and complicate .",
    "however , the least advantage of this analysis is the fact that essentially late - time acceleration can be explained naturally within our setup .",
    "we see for instance that with @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 there is no possibility to have accelerated expansion with @xmath135 since there is no intersection point in the graph .",
    "on the other hand , accelerated expansion with @xmath136 requires @xmath137 or @xmath132 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 for instance . as a common role in this analysis , we have noticed that from equation ( 27 ) , only for positive values of @xmath7 with @xmath140 and for positive or negative @xmath104 there are intersection points and therefore accelerated expansion .",
    "these analysis , though very simple and especial , show that @xmath0 dgp - inspired scenarios essentially account for positively accelerated expansion .",
    ".some choices of parameters for equation ( 27 ) to be preserved .",

    "similarly , in the normal dgp model , that is , when @xmath148 and with no ordinary matter present , we can not define the equation of state because the scale factor on the brane is constant and equation of state parameter will be singular [ 10,20 ] . in our @xmath0 setup with  @xmath149 ,",
    "as we have discussed previously , to have accelerated expansion we need to rstrict @xmath7 to the interval @xmath140 .",
    "in this situation , there is no term with the first power of the ricci scalar to obtain ordinary einstein - like interactions between two astrophysical objects , such as the sun and mercury . to overcome this problem in our setup ,",
    "we have treated the case with @xmath148 separately after equation ( 25 ) above . on the other hand ,",
    "if we choose theories such as @xmath150 $ ] where @xmath151 is a suitably chosen parameter , our model will contain the case with @xmath148 and therefore general relativity .",
    "we will come back to this issue later with more details .",
    "because of explicit interaction between scalar field and curvature , the equation of state parameter for non - minimally coupled scalar field in this @xmath0 dgp - inspired setup is as follows @xmath152 which can be written as    @xmath153}{\\frac{1}{2}\\dot{\\phi}^{2}+v(\\phi)- 6\\frac{d f}{d\\phi}h\\dot{\\phi}+\\frac{m_{3}^{2}}{f'(r,\\phi)}\\big(\\frac{1}{2}f(r,\\phi)- \\frac{1}{2}r f'(r,\\phi)-3\\dot{r}h\\frac{d^2f}{dr^2}\\big)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this is a general statement for equation of state in @xmath0 setup . to proceed further",
    ", we have to specify the functional form of @xmath0 .",
    "firstly we assume a conformal coupling between scalar field and induced @xmath116-gravity as @xmath154 .",
    "the scalar field potential is chosen to be @xmath8 and then using natural ansatz @xmath98 and @xmath155 , the following time - dependent equation of state parameter will be derived    @xmath156@xmath157@xmath158    the equation of state parameter in this scenario has a very complicated form . to find further intuition ,",
    "this equation is plotted for several interesting cases in which follows . as these figures show , essentially crossing of phantom divide line , @xmath159 , is supported in this @xmath0 dgp - inspired model .",
    "however there are some points that should be stressed here . as figure @xmath160 shows ,",
    "the minimal case for a single scalar field has no phantom divide line crossing for some region of parameter space .",
    "on the other hand , this non - minimal @xmath0 setup has no crossing of phantom divide line with negative @xmath7 values .",
    "however , as table @xmath128 and related arguments in preceding section show , accelerated expansion is possible even with negative @xmath7 values .",
    "this is supported by other studies [ 21 ] .",
    "for @xmath161 we have a power - low acceleration on the brane without having to introduce dark energy .",
    "this result is consistent with the observational results similar to dark energy with the equation of state parameter @xmath162 which has no phantom divide line crossing .",
    "figures @xmath163 and @xmath164 show the time evolution of equation of state parameter with some suitable values of model parameters .",
    "as we have stressed previously , the case with @xmath148 needs further discussion .",
    "we have adopted the ansatz @xmath154 and our analysis has shown that @xmath7 should be restricted to the interval @xmath140 to have reliable cosmology in this setup .",
    "in this situation there is no term with the first power of the ricci scalar to obtain ordinary einstein - like interactions between two astrophysical objects , such as the sun and mercury . to overcome this problem in our dgp - inspired @xmath0 gravity",
    "we have treated the case with @xmath148 separately in subsection 3.1 and after equation ( 25 ) .",
    "form more general viewpoint , we can unify these arguments by choosing the following form of @xmath0 @xmath165,\\ ] ] where @xmath151 is a suitably chosen parameter [ 3,21 ] .",
    "the accelerated expansion and crossing of phantom divide line in this setup can be studied in the line of previous arguments in this paper .",
    "fortunately this type of theories contain @xmath148 and general relativity as a subset .",

    "figure @xmath172 and @xmath173 show the result of numerical analysis of this model .",
    "we see that these types of theories essentially account for crossing of phantom divide line . in this case as figure @xmath173 shows , we have crossing even with negative values of @xmath7 .",
    "note that by choosing negative values of @xmath7 , we can treat theories with @xmath174 in this framework . the model proposed by carroll _",
    "et al _ [ 21 ] , lies in this framework . for treating the issue of late time acceleration in this case , friedmann and acceleration equation with this choice of @xmath0",
    "take the following forms @xmath175@xmath176 and    @xmath177@xmath178@xmath179    where @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 are defined previously .",
    "numerical analysis of these equations shows the possibility of intersection points and therefore accelerated expansion .",
    "for instance , figure @xmath183 shows the situation for a specific choice of the parameters .    as another important point",
    ", the issue of stability of the self - accelerated solutions should be stressed here .",
    "the self - accelerating branch of the dgp model contains a ghost at the linearized level [ 22 ] .",
    "since the ghost carries negative energy density , it leads to the instability of the spacetime .",
    "the presence of the ghost can be attributed to the infinite volume of the extra - dimension in dgp setup . when there are ghosts instabilities in self - accelerating branch , it is natural to ask what are the results of solutions decay . as a possible answer we can state",
    "that since the normal branch solutions are ghost - free , one can think that the self - accelerating solutions may decay into the normal branch solutions .",
    "in fact for a given brane tension , the hubble parameter in the self - accelerating universe is larger than that of the normal branch solutions",
    ". then it is possible to have nucleation of bubbles of the normal branch in the environment of the self - accelerating branch solution .",
    "this is similar to the false vacuum decay in de sitter space .",
    "however , there are arguments against this kind of reasoning which suggest that the self - accelerating branch does not decay into the normal branch by forming normal branch bubbles ( see [ 22 ] for more details ) .",
    "it was also shown that the introduction of gauss - bonnet term in the bulk does not help to overcome this problem [ 23 ] .",
    "in fact , it is still unclear what is the end state of the ghost instability in self - accelerated branch of dgp inspired setups ( for more details see [ 22 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "non - minimal coupling of scalar field and induced gravity in our @xmath0 setup provides a new degree of freedom which requires special fine tuning and this my provide a suitable basis to treat ghost instability .",
    "it seems that in our model this additional degree of freedom has the capability to provide the background for a more reliable solution to ghost instability due to wider parameter space .",
    "finally , the phantom divide line crossing in conventional scalar field theory violates positive energy theorems . in our setup , non - minimal coupling of scalar field and induced gravity has the capability to evade this problem .",
    "in fact , following lue and starkman [ 24 ] , if we consider the frw phase instead of the self - accelerating phase , and relax the presumption that the cosmological constant be zero ( i.e. , abandon the notion of completely replacing dark energy ) , then we can achieve @xmath184 without violating the null - energy condition , without ghost instabilities and without a big rip ( see [ 24 - 27 ] for more details ) .",
    "current positively accelerated expansion of the universe could be the result of a modification to the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "also dgp braneworld scenario has the capability to interpret this late - time acceleration via leakage of gravity to extra dimension in its self - accelerating branch . on the other hand ,",
    "there are several compelling reasons for inclusion of an explicit non - minimal coupling of scalar field and induced gravity on the brane sector of dgp action [ 14,16 ] .",
    "these arguments have led us to study cosmological implications of a dgp - inspired @xmath0 gravity .",
    "although this issue has been studied extensively for the minimal case , our setup provides a new approach to treat accelerated expansion within a general framework of _ modified _ scalar - tensor theories taking into account the role played by curvature correction and non - minimal coupling of scalar field and modified curvature simultaneously .",
    "we have studied late - time acceleration and possible crossing of phantom divide line in this setup .",
    "the condition for accelerated expansion and also equation governing on the dynamics of equation of state parameter are very complicated , so that we were forced to try a reliable and natural ansatz to find some intuition .",
    "we have shown that this setup accounts for accelerated expansion with a suitable choice of parameters space or fine - tuning .",
    "also , this setup accounts for crossing of phantom divide line in some ranges of parameters appeared in the model . in the minimal case ,",
    "our model coincides with existing models of @xmath14 gravity .",
    "especially the case with @xmath161 in the absence of non - minimal coupling exactly coincides with well - known result [ 21 ] .",
    "on the other hand , for a single scalar field with minimal coupling to gravity there are region of parameter space with no phantom divide line crossing .",
    "we have seen in the numerical calculations that with @xmath185 , for both @xmath137 and @xmath132 and with arbitrary @xmath104 , there is no crossing of phantom divide line for negative values of @xmath7 ( figure @xmath163 ) .",
    "however positively accelerated expansion of the universe can be explained in this situation with negative @xmath7 . on the other hand , if @xmath140 , for negative @xmath104 we have crossing of the phantom divide line ( see figure @xmath164 ) . as an important result in the analysis of late - time behavior , from equation ( 27 )",
    "we find that only for positive values of @xmath7 with @xmath140 and for positive or negative values of @xmath104 , there are intersection points and therefore accelerated expansion for corresponding parameters choice .",
    "the case with @xmath148 which describes ordinary general relativity has been treated separately . by adopting more general theories such as @xmath150 $ ] ,",
    "the previous restriction on @xmath7 is relaxed so that @xmath148 is a natural subset of the model . in summary ,",
    "accelerated expansion can be explained by both positive and negative values of @xmath7 with suitable fine - tuning of other parameters . on the other hand crossing of phantom divide line in  @xmath117 model can be explained only with positive values of @xmath7 and fine - tuning of other parameters .",
    "the range of variation of @xmath7 to have crossing of phantom divide line in this setup is @xmath140 .",
    "however in theories with @xmath150 $ ] this crossing occurs for both negative and positive values of @xmath7 . for theories of the type",
    "@xmath150 $ ] , @xmath7 is not restricted to this interval and these theories account for phantom divide line crossing even for negative values of @xmath7 as figure @xmath173 shows .",
    "the issues of ghost instabilities and violation of positive energy theorems have been discussed also . due to wider parameter space as a result of non - minimal coupling of scalar field and modified gravity , we hope this model can evade these problems .",
