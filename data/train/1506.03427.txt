    "wormholes are topologically nontrivial objects which connect two separate and distinct spacetime regions @xcite .",
    "a fundamental ingredient in wormhole physics is the flaring - out condition of the throat , which in general relativity ( gr ) entails the violation of the null energy condition ( nec ) .",
    "matter that violates the nec is denoted exotic matter .",
    "in fact , wormholes violate all of the pointwise and averaged energy condition mty . due to the problematic nature of these violations , it is useful to minimize the exoticity problem of the matter threading and sustaining the wormhole .",
    "for instance , traversable wormholes supported by arbitrarily small quantities of exotic matter @xcite or by matter respecting the energy conditions @xcite have been investigated .",
    "an interesting kind of traversable wormhole is the thin - shell variety constructed by surgically grafting together two spacetimes to form a geodesically complete manifold with a shell placed at the junction interface . in these types of wormholes",
    ", matter is concentrated on the wormhole throat , which coincides with the junction boundary , and thus minimizes the usage of exotic matter .",
    "these solutions were initially presented in @xcite and have been extensively investigated in the literature @xcite . in gr , it was shown that thin - shell wormholes inevitably violate the weak energy condition ( wec ) and , consequently , various attempts have been undertaken , to alleviate this problem , in alternative theories of gravity , for instance , in dilatonic gravity bej , brans - dicke theory @xcite and dgp gravity @xcite .",
    "an advantage of the thin - shell construction is that one may consider a linearized stability analysis around the static solution , while preserving the symmetric configuration , and analyse the dynamical evolution of the thin - shell @xcite .",
    "the generalization of the stability analysis to the case of higher - dimensional wormholes has also been extensively investigated @xcite .",
    "for instance , a linearized stability analysis in the presence of a dilaton , axion , phantom and other types of matter and in cylindrical symmetry have also been studied @xcite .    since string theory proposes higher dimensional gravitational objects , it is of interest to explore the possibility of higher dimensional thin - shell wormhole solutions .",
    "one of the most interesting higher dimensional alternative theories of gravity which leads to second order field equations for the metric is described by the lovelock action @xcite . in this context ,",
    "thin shell wormholes of second order lovelock theory called gauss - bonnet theory in @xmath0-dimensions and higher dimensions were extensively analysed @xcite . in the context of third order lovelock gravity ,",
    "asymptotically flat and charged thin - shell wormholes of lovelock gravity in seven dimensions were constructed , using the cut - and - paste technique , and the generalized junction conditions were applied in order to calculate the energy - momentum tensor of these wormholes on the shell @xcite . it was found that for negative second order and positive third order lovelock coefficients , there are thin - shell wormholes that respect the wec in specific regions . in this case , the amount of normal matter decreases as the third order lovelock coefficient increases . for positive second and third",
    "order lovelock coefficients , the wec is violated and the amount of exotic matter decreases as the charge increases .",
    "furthermore , a linear stability analysis was analysed against a symmetry preserving perturbation , and the stability of these wormhole were studied .    in this work ,",
    "we extend the analysis outlined in @xcite , by providing the explicit form of the surface energy - momentum tensor and generalize the analysis to arbitrary dimensions .",
    "more specifically , we present the explicit form of the energy - momentum tensor in terms of the extrinsic curvature and riemann tensor for all higher dimensions , and find specific solutions , including novel solutions which possess specific regions where the energy conditions are satisfied for the particular cases of positive second order and negative third - order lovelock coefficients . furthermore , we present the generalized junction conditions , and analyse the stability analysis for the solutions found , for arbitrary dimensions .",
    "thus , we study the effects of the third order lovelock term in higher dimensionality , its role in the satisfaction of the wec and the stability of thin shell wormhole solutions in higher dimensions .",
    "this paper is organised in the following manner : in section [ sol ] , we present the action of third order lovelock gravity in the presence of an electromagnetic field , and construct a thin - shell wormhole in lovelock gravity , by presenting explicitly the surface energy - momentum tensor components on the shell . in particular , to complement the above section [ sol ] , the specific @xmath1-dimensional static solutions , that are to be used throughout the work , are outlined in appendix [ app : i ] . in appendix",

    "<S> in this work , we explore asymptotically flat charged thin - shell wormholes of third order lovelock gravity in higher dimensions , taking into account the cut - and - paste technique . using the generalized junction conditions , we determine the energy - momentum tensor of these solutions on the shell , and explore the issue of the energy conditions and the amount of normal matter that supports these thin - shell wormholes . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that for negative second order and positive third - order lovelock coefficients , there are thin - shell wormhole solutions that respect the weak energy condition . in this case , the amount of normal matter increases as the third - order lovelock coefficient decreases . </S>",
    "<S> we also find novel solutions which possess specific regions where the energy conditions are satisfied for the case of a positive second order and negative third - order lovelock coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> finally , a linear stability analysis in higher dimensions around the static solutions is carried out . considering a specific cold equation of state </S>",
    "<S> , we find a wide range of stability regions . </S>"
