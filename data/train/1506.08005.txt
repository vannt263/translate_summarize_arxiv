    "@xmath0-decay is very important process in nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "the theory of @xmath0-decay was formulated by gamow @xcite and independently by condon and gurney @xcite . subsequently various phenomenological and microscopic approaches to the description of @xmath0-decay",
    "were proposed ; see , for example , refs . @xcite and papers cited therein .",
    "the simple empirical relationships for description of @xmath0-decay half - lives have been discussed too , see , for example , refs . @xcite and numerous references therein .",
    "the @xmath0-decay process involves sub - barrier penetration of @xmath0-particles through the barrier , caused by interaction between @xmath0-particle and nucleus .",
    "the fusion ( @xmath0-capture ) reaction between the @xmath0-particle and nucleus proceeds in the opposite direction to the @xmath0-decay reaction .",
    "however , the same @xmath0-nucleus interaction potential is the principal ingredient to describe both reactions .",
    "therefore it is natural to use data for both the @xmath0-decay half - lives and the near barrier @xmath0-capture reactions for determination of the @xmath0-nucleus interaction potential .",
    "the @xmath0-decay half - lives and the @xmath0-capture cross sections are evaluated in the framework of the unified model for @xmath0-decay and @xmath0-capture ( umadac ) in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the experimental information on the @xmath0-decay is extensive .",
    "the experimental data are continually being expanded and refined .",
    "the data have been updated very recently @xcite .",
    "the ground - state masses and spins of nuclei have been updated continually too @xcite .",
    "more accurate atomic mass values lead to more exact definition of the @xmath6 values of the ground - state - to - ground - state @xmath0 transitions .",
    "more precise definition of the angular momentum value of the emitted @xmath0 particle relates to accurate values of the ground - state spins .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to use extended and updated the data for ground - state - to - ground - state @xmath0-decay transitions @xcite , atomic masses , and spins @xcite for more accurate and full description of the @xmath0-decay half - lives in the framework of umadac .",
    "the data for the @xmath0-decay half - lives for 401 nuclei and the @xmath0-capture cross sections of @xmath1ca , @xmath2ca , @xmath3co , @xmath4pb , and @xmath5bi @xcite are used now . in comparison to this ,",
    "our previous dataset @xcite contained 344 cases for the ground - state - to - ground - state @xmath0-transitions .",
    "it is very important to have simple and accurate expressions for evaluation of @xmath0-decay half - lives which can be used very easily .",
    "the first empirical formula for @xmath0-decay half - lives was presented by geiger and nuttall @xcite . since then",
    ", many other empirical relationships have been proposed by various authors ; see , for example , refs . @xcite and papers cited therein .    in general",
    ", experimentalists would like to evaluate expected half - life values during experiment design .",
    "this is especially important for @xmath0-decay studies of superheavy elements @xcite or nuclei , which are very far from the stability line @xcite , because such processes are very rare and difficult to observe .",
    "that is why , simple and accurate empirical relationships are still claimed . as a consequence ,",
    "many empirical expressions have appeared during the last several decades @xcite .",
    "the new extended data for the @xmath0-decay half - lives , atomic masses , and spins give the possibility of improving the accuracy of the empirical relationships introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the main points of umadac is briefly presented in sec .",
    "ii . a discussion of the input data , adjustable parameters and results is given in sec .",
    "secion iv is dedicated to consideration of the simple empirical relationships for description of the @xmath0-decay half - lives .",
    "the conclusion is given in sec .",
    "the @xmath0-decay half - life @xmath7 in umadac depends on the total width @xmath8 of the @xmath0-emission @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the total width of decay , @xmath11 is the partial width of the @xmath0 emission in the direction @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the space angle .",
    "we consider the axial - symmetric nuclei therefore @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the @xmath0-particle frequency of assaults on the barrier , which takes into account @xmath0-particle preformation ; @xmath17 is the transmission coefficient , which shows the probability of penetration through the barrier ; and @xmath6 is the released energy at @xmath0 decay .",
    "the transmission coefficient can be obtained in the semiclassical wkb approximation as @xmath18 \\right\\ } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the inner and outer turning points determined from the equations @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the reduced mass .",
    "the @xmath0-nucleus potential @xmath23 consists of coulomb @xmath24 , nuclear @xmath25 and centrifugal @xmath26 parts @xmath27 where @xmath28\\ ] ] for @xmath29 , @xmath30\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath31 , @xmath32},\\ ] ] @xmath33 here @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are , respectively , the number of protons , the radius , the quadrupole and hexadecapole deformation parameters of the nucleus interacting with the @xmath0-particle ; @xmath38 is the charge of proton , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the harmonic functions ; @xmath41 and @xmath42 are , correspondingly , the strength and the effective radius of the nuclear part of the @xmath0-nucleus potential .",
    "presentation of the coulomb field in the form ( 7 ) at distances @xmath43 ensures the continuity of the coulomb field and its derivative at matching point @xmath44 .",
    "the expressions for @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath45 are given below .",
    "the angle and angular momentum are the canonical variables in quantum mechanics and do not commute .",
    "therefore a simultaneous specification of the angle and angular momentum is restricted by the uncertainty principle @xcite .",
    "note the angular momentum of @xmath0-transition @xmath46 is the precisely specified variable in our approach for @xmath0-decay .",
    "in contrast to this , the angle of @xmath0-particle emission from a deformed nucleus is not experimentally observed , and we take the averaging on all possible directions of @xmath0-emission , see eq . ( 2 ) .",
    "therefore the simultaneous use of the angle and angular momentum in eq .",
    "( 5 ) with the consequent averaging on the angle of @xmath0-particle emission may be applicable at the semiclassical evaluation of @xmath0-decay half - lives .",
    "nevertheless , the canonical variables are treated more consistently in the framework of the exact coupled channels approaches for @xmath0-decay of deformed nuclei , see , for example , refs . @xcite and papers cited therein .",
    "the @xmath0-capture cross section of an axial - symmetric nucleus at near - barrier collision energy @xmath47 in the center - of - mass system is equal to @xcite @xmath48 here the integration over angle @xmath12 is done for the same reason as in eq .",
    "the transmission coefficient @xmath49 can be evaluated using the semiclassical wkb approximation ( see eq .",
    "( 4 ) ) in the case of collision between the @xmath0 particle and stiff magic or near - magic spherical nuclei at collision energies @xmath47 below and slightly above barrier .",
    "the @xmath0-nucleus potential is given by eqs .",
    "( 5)-(9 ) .",
    "the transmission coefficient is approximated by an expression for a parabolic barrier at collision energies higher than or equal to the barrier energy .",
    "we choose the data for 401 @xmath0-transitions between the ground states of parent and daughter nuclei with known values of both the half - lives from refs . @xcite and the spins of parent and daughter nuclei from ref .",
    "we select the ground - state - to - ground - state transitions , which have a difference between measured @xcite and evaluated using the atomic mass data @xcite @xmath0-particle energies less than or equal to 10 kev .",
    "the recoil energy of the daughter nucleus is taken into account at the evaluation of the @xmath0-particle energy .",
    "the energies of excitation states in parent and daughter nuclei are larger than 10 kev in most of the selected nuclei @xcite , therefore we choose the true ground - state - to - ground - state @xmath0-transitions .",
    "moreover , the experimental data with precisely measured @xmath0-particle energy are selected by using this limitation . the additional manual selection of transitions is also used for some cases .",
    "our previous dataset @xcite contains 344 cases for the ground - state - to - ground - state @xmath0-transitions .",
    "note some data presented in our old dataset @xcite ( see , for example , the ground - state - to - ground - state @xmath0-transitions in @xmath50ra , @xmath51th and many other cases ) are skipped in the recent data compilation @xcite .",
    "the reason of such data omission in the recent compilation is not known for us . therefore we make the current dataset for @xmath7 for the ground - state - to - ground - state @xmath0-transitions by adding some data from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the data for @xmath0-capture cross sections of @xmath1ca , @xmath2ca , @xmath3co , @xmath4pb and @xmath5bi were taken from refs .",
    "these data are the same as before @xcite .",
    "the energy released in @xmath0-decay between the ground states of parent and daughter nuclei is calculated using recent evaluation of the atomic mass data @xcite .",
    "the atomic mass consists of nucleons and electrons contributions .",
    "the contribution of the binding energy of atomic electrons in the energy of @xmath0-decay should be separated , because the @xmath0-decay is the nuclear process .",
    "therefore the released energy of @xmath0-decay ( @xmath6 ) , emitted at transition between ground states of the parent and daughter nuclei , is @xcite @xmath52 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are , correspondingly , the mass - excess of parent , daughter , and @xmath0 nuclei .",
    "@xmath56 is the electron binding energy of the atom with the number of electrons @xmath34 .",
    "the value of the electron binding energy is evaluated by using the high - precision formula @xcite",
    "@xmath57    the new hartree - fock - bogoliubov nuclear mass model based on standard forms of skyrme and pairing functionals was presented recently @xcite .",
    "this mass model is characterized by a model standard deviation @xmath58 mev with respect to essentially all the 2353 available mass data for nuclei with neutron and proton numbers larger than 8 .",
    "the values of deformation parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 obtained in the framework of this accurate model @xcite are used in our calculation for specifying the deformation of daughter nuclei .",
    "the @xmath0-particle emission from nuclei obeys the spin - parity selection rule .",
    "let @xmath59 and @xmath60 be the spin and parity values of the parent and daughter nuclei respectively .",
    "the @xmath0 particle has zero value of spin and positive parity , therefore the minimal value of angular momentum @xmath61 at the @xmath0-transition between states with @xmath59 and @xmath60 is @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "the values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the parametrizations of the parameters of the @xmath0-nucleus potential ( 8) and the @xmath0-particle frequency of assault on the barrier ( 3 ) have the same form as previously @xcite @xmath64 here @xmath65 and @xmath34 are the number of nucleons and protons in the nucleus , which is interacting with the @xmath0-particle , and @xmath66 .",
    "we search the parameters by using the updated datasets .",
    "the procedure of parameters search is described in details in ref .",
