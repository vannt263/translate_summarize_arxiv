    "one of the most straightforward examples of the great difficulties associated with the measure of basic physical quantities on the astrophysical scales is provided by the quest for the mass of the milky way . even applying the most refined analysis and using the whole wealth of available data , realistic uncertainties affecting single estimates of such a fundamental parameter tipycally amount to @xmath6 % ( see , e.g.",
    "* for a state - of - the - art analysis ) .",
    "the whole problem was recently reviewed and critically discussed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter z99 ) .",
    "this author notes that the concept of total mass of the milky way is somehow ill - defined since we ignore the actual extent of the dark matter ( dm ) halo of the galaxy .",
    "hence , it is much safer to refer mass estimates to the _ enclosed mass _ within the galactocentric distance ( @xmath7 ) sampled by the mass - tracer under consideration .",
    "this approach allows a sensible comparison between different estimates , since consistency requires that all estimates shall be in agreement with a unique mass profile [ @xmath8 over the whole range of galactocentric distances that can be probed .",
    "z99 uses the _ isothermal sphere _ as a reference model to perform such a comparison and concludes that all the available estimates , covering different ranges in @xmath7 and using different tracers ( from the hi rotation curve to the outermost galactic satellites ) , are consistent with the mass profile of an isothermal sphere with rotational velocity @xmath9 km / s .",
    "note that in this context the isothermal sphere is ( obviously ) _ not _ intended as a realistic model for the galactic dm halo , but just as a suitable mass profile to provide comparison and cross - validation of the various estimates . hence , despite the large uncertainties affecting the single mass estimates , a remarkable overall consistency is apparent .",
    "if interpreted in the classical newtonian framework , the mass of the galaxy ( @xmath10 ) is observed to grow approximately as @xmath11 and the enclosed mass within @xmath12 kpc is of order @xmath13 ( z99 ) .",
    "all the estimates considered by z99 ( as well as the more recent ones in the post-99 literature ) rely on the kinematics of the adopted tracers ( rotational velocity curve , escape velocity of local stars , motion of satellites , either stars , globular clusters or dwarf galaxies ) .",
    "therefore , an estimate of @xmath14 not based on kinematical data would provide a further important consistency check of our ideas on the mass profile of the galaxy .",
    "such kind of probe may be provided by tidal radii of globular clusters ( gc ) @xcite .",
    "theory predicts that the galactic tidal field fixes the cut - off in the density profile of gcs , the position of the cut - off depending on the cluster distance and on the ratio between the mass of the galaxy and the mass of the cluster ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "hence , having @xmath15 and @xmath7 from observations , an estimate of @xmath10 may be obtained , though affected by large uncertainties .",
    "the approach has been attempted in the past by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter w81 ) and by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ihw ) .",
    "w81 used globular clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies as tracers , and obtained @xmath16 .",
    "the result is in marginal disagreement with the conclusions by z99 but is probably affected by the large uncertainties in the distance and tidal radii of dwarf spheroidals ( for the same reasons these galaxies are not considered in the present analysis ) .",
    "ihw used only gcs and found @xmath17 , consistent , within the uncertainties , with the z99 results .",
    "there are cogent reasons to try to repeat the experiment twenty years later .",
    "the quality of the observational material is greatly improved , mainly thanks to the extensive compilation of surface brightness profiles by @xcite , and theoretical advancements put the problem in a new light @xcite .",
    "moreover the impressive growth of computing facilities allow an accurate analysis of the uncertainties ( a particularly critical point for this kind of application , see ihw for a discussion ) by means of extensive montecarlo simulations .",
    "in this paper i review the use of tidal radii of globular clusters in the light of the more recent theoretical and observational result and i check if the mass estimates from this technique are consistent with `` kinematical '' estimates , dealing in particular with the mass profile at large @xmath7 , e.g. the most interesting range ( sect .  2 ) .",
    "the main conclusions and future prospects are summarized in sect .",
    "a general formula for the tidal radius ( @xmath18 ) of a globular cluster of mass @xmath15 orbiting around a galaxy of mass @xmath19 is ( @xcite , ihw , w99 ) :    @xmath20^{\\frac{1}{3}}r_p\\ ] ]    where @xmath21 is the peri - galactic distance , @xmath22 is a function depending on the form of the galactic potential and on the eccentricity of the cluster orbit @xmath23 and @xmath24 is a factor , firstly introduced by @xcite to account for the elongation of the limiting tidal surface along the line between the cluster center and the galactic center . according to this author , ihw and w99 assume @xmath25 . from now on we drop , for brevity , the explicit indication of the dependence of mass on distance : in any case @xmath10 shall be intended as the mass enclosed with a given galactocentric distance @xmath26 ( the correponding index is also dropped , from now on @xmath26 means @xmath7 ) .    , the vertical line marks @xmath27 kpc .",
    "the names of the clusters with @xmath28 kpc are also reported.,width=317 ]    the dependence on @xmath23 was introduced by @xcite by reformulating the equation for the instantaneous tidal radius of @xcite in terms of the perigalactic distance ( instead of the instantaneous distance @xmath26 ) .",
    "this choice was motivated by the fact that the typical orbital period ( @xmath29 ) of globulars was expected to be much shorter than the internal relaxation time ( tipically quantified by the half - mass relaxation time @xmath30 ) . in this case",
    "two - body relaxation is unable to keep the external structure of the cluster at pace with the changing galactic tidal field .",
    "in other words , the tidal force at perigalacticon truncates the cluster at the corresponding radius and the internal relaxation is too slow to restore a larger limiting radius before the next perigalactic passage ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "however recent comparisons between predicted and observed tidal radii that included all the information on cluster orbits ( as derived from measured proper motions * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) showed that observed tidal radii are larger than one would expect if they were fixed at the perigalactic point .",
    "@xcite suggest that the actual tidal radius depends on the orbital phase , while @xcite argue that a suitable average along the orbit defines a much more proper tidal radius with respect to the perigalactic value .",
    "@xcite and @xcite studied in detail the properties of tidal radii of globular clusters by means of n - body simulations .",
    "they found that while the tidal limit of clusters with @xmath31 is effectively set at perigalacticon , in clusters with @xmath32 internal relaxation effects are able to repopulate their external regions after the perigalacticon passage and their tidal radius may be comparable to the value expected at _ apogalacticon_.    in fig .  1 the logarithm of the @xmath33 ratio is plotted versus the galactocentric distance for all the clusters for which orbital parameters from measured proper motions are available ( from the computations by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the relaxation times are from the 2003 version of the @xcite catalogue , which is the source of all the globular cluster data used in this study if not otherwise stated .",
    "there is a clear correlation between @xmath34 and @xmath26 suggesting that beyond @xmath35 kpc clusters are very likely to have @xmath36 , i.e. , according to the results by @xcite , their @xmath18 does not reflect the tidal force at perigalacticon .    on the basis of all the above considerations i make the assumption that _ the observed tidal radii of distant globular clusters ( e.g. , those with @xmath37 kpc ) are probes of the galactic tidal force at their present position_. in other words i take the galactocentric distance @xmath38 as a reasonable approximation of the effective orbital radius at which the tidal radius of clusters with @xmath36 is fixed @xcite .",
    "the assumption limits the range that can be probed to the outer halo of the galaxy . on the other hand",
    "this is the most interesting range since the contribution of barionic matter to the mass budget is expected to be negligible in this region .",
    "furthermore , clusters orbiting in such remote regions are less likely to have their structure changed by close encounters with the galactic disk , bulge or with large molecular clouds , and are therefore more reliable probes of the galactic tidal field ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for an extensive review of the mechanisms affecting the structure of gcs ) .    following the above assumption ,",
    "the following form of the theoretical tidal radius is adopted :    @xmath39^{\\frac{1}{3}}r\\ ] ]    e.g , eq .  1 with @xmath40 and @xmath26 instead of @xmath21 . in the context of a logarithmic potential",
    "this is the exact formula for the tidal radius of a cluster on a circular orbit @xcite . solving with respect to @xmath10 :    @xmath41    w81 , ihw and @xcite derived @xmath22 for eccentric orbits in a logarithmic potential .",
    "it is important to note that the adoption of @xmath42 , instead of the instantaneous value @xmath43 adopted here , has a modest impact on the final @xmath10 estimates .",
    "the adoption of the @xmath44 by @xcite changes the final @xmath10 estimate by a factor @xmath45 for @xmath46 and by a factor @xmath47 for @xmath48 with respect to the @xmath40 case adopted here . in any case",
    "the derived @xmath10 is larger than what obtained with eq .",
    "3 . in analogy with the analysis that will be described in sect .",
    "2.2 i performed an extensive set of montecarlo experiments using the @xmath44 version of eq .  1 and exploring the whole range of possible orbital eccentricities",
    ". the resulting mass ( and mass profile ) estimates are fully consistent with the results obtained from eq .",
    ", the approximations involved in the adopted approach appear fully adequate for the present purpose ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "tidal radii of gcs are not , in general , directely observable quantities .",
    "fitting king models @xcite to surface brightess profile of globular clusters one obtains an estimate of the core radius ( @xmath49 ) and of the concentration parameter @xmath50 log @xmath51 ; @xmath18 is derived from these fitted parameters .",
    "hence , the best estimates of @xmath18 may be obtained from bright clusters ( e.g. , providing high signal - to - noise data for the fit ) whose surface brightness profile is reliably measured over the largest possible radial range ( thus limiting at a minimum the extrapolation to the actual tidal limit ) .    unfortunately the range @xmath52 kpc is mainly populated by sparse , low luminosity clusters whose tidal radii and integrated magnitudes are quite uncertain .",
    "the suitable galactic clusters in the relevant range of galactocentric distances are : pal  15 , ngc  7006 , pyxis , pal  14 , ngc  2419 , eridanus , pal  3 , pal  4 and am-1 .",
    "pal  15 and pyxis have been excluded since they are affected by significant amount of interstellar extinction ( @xmath53 mag , that implies a larger uncertainty in the estimate of @xmath15 ) .",
    "note however that the inclusion of these clusters does not change in any way the final results presented below . of the remaining clusters",
    "the best suited for the present analysis are ngc  7006 and ngc  2419 , two bright and well studied clusters .",
    "in particular ngc  2419 is the 4-th most luminous cluster of the whole galaxy ( @xmath54 ) and its surface brightness profile have been reliably measured out to the 85 % of the deduced tidal radius , i.e. the level of extrapolation is quite modest .",
    "finally ngc  2419 is the only cluster of the considered set for which a direct estimate of the mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath55 , a fundamental ingredient to derive @xmath15 ) is available ( @xmath56 , from * ? ? ? * ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "ngc  7006 and ngc  2419 provide by far the most robust and less uncertain mass probes , the remaining clusters are retained just for consistency check .",
    "@xmath10 is estimated from each cluster using eq .  3 . to deal with uncertainties i obtained 10000 independent @xmath10 estimates for each cluster by extracting at random ( from suitable distributions described below ) the following quantities : the observed v - band distance modulus @xmath57 , the apparent integrated v magnitude @xmath58 , the tidal radius in arcmin @xmath18 , the v - band mass - to - light ratio in solar units @xmath55 and keenan s @xmath24 factor ( see below ) .",
    "the color excess [ @xmath59 is kept fixed , since it is small ( less than @xmath60 mag ) in all of the considered cases . for each set of extracted parameter",
    "the following items are computed : the distance from the sun and the galactic center from @xmath57 , @xmath61 and the galactic coordinates , the linear tidal radius from its angular value and distance , the mass of the cluster from @xmath58 , @xmath57 and @xmath55 , and finally , from @xmath26 and @xmath18 in kpc and @xmath15 in solar masses , the galactic mass enclosed within @xmath26 .",
    "all the distributions are chosen to ( conservatively ) cover the whole range that is compatible with the adopted uncertainties of each parameter , hence the final 10000 @xmath10 estimates cover the whole range allowed by taking into account _ all the possible sources of error_. finally the median of the 10000 estimates is computed as well as the range in @xmath10 including the 90 % of the derived @xmath10 estimates .      to have a closer look to the details of the simulations , the assumptions on input parameters are shortly described below .",
    "* @xmath24 factor .",
    "keenan s factor ( @xmath25 ) provides an average correction for the non - spherical shape of the limiting tidal surface . to account for the possible cluster - to - cluster variation of this parameter",
    ", @xmath24 is extracted from a uniform distribution in the range @xmath62 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath57 . to account for both the measurement errors and the uncertainties still affecting the distance scale of globular clusters ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) @xmath57 values were extracted from a gaussian distribution with mean equal to the @xmath57 listed by @xcite and standard deviation @xmath63 mag for ngc  2419 and ngc  7006 and @xmath64 mag for the remaining , less extensively studied , clusters .",

    "note that the measure of this parameter is particularly critical for low - density and low - brightness clusters , like the majority of those considered here .",
    ". the observed fundamental plane of gcs @xcite implies that the @xmath55 ratio of globular clusters is constant to within a factor of a few , approximately compatible with the measurement errors .",
    "@xcite find @xmath67 in good agreement with @xcite . here",
    "the @xmath55 values are extracted from a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath68 ( e.g. , the estimated @xmath55 of ngc  2419 and the average @xmath55 derived by @xcite ) and @xmath69 , with the further constraint @xmath70 .",
    "this assumption ensures that the range of observed @xmath55 of gcs is fully explored . *",
    "i searched the literature to find estimates of @xmath18 for the considered clusters that may supersede those reported by @xcite , all drawn from @xcite .",
    "the only ( partially ) successful case was pal  14 , for which i adopt the estimate by @xcite whose density profile is marginally more extended with respect to that by @xcite .",
    "the adopted @xmath18 values are extracted from a gaussian distribution with the mean equal to the listed values and with standard deviation in the range @xmath71 , depending on the quality and extension of the available surface brightness profile . in particular",
    "@xmath72 for ngc  2419 , @xmath73 for ngc  7006 and @xmath74 for the remaining clusters .",
    "the referee correctly pointed out that the estimates of tidal radii may be also plagued by systematics .",
    "for example the adoption of different models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to fit the surface brightness profiles of globulars may lead to obtain significantly larger limiting radii than what estimated with king s models ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for an application ) .",
    "moreover , some theoretical studies also suggest that realistic models of globular clusters in the galactic tidal field may be slightly more spatially extended than king s models ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to explore the effect of systematics that may change the observationally estimated @xmath18 values up to a factor @xmath75 i repeated the analysis described above for ngc  2419 ( @xmath76 , according to *",
    "* ) assuming @xmath77 instead of @xmath72 . to preserve compatibility with the observed profile , which reaches @xmath78 , i forced the randomly extracted tidal radii to the range @xmath79",
    ". hence the final @xmath18 of the montecarlo simulation are in the range @xmath80 .",
    "note that at @xmath81 the observed profile is rapidly falling and the surface brightness is @xmath82 mag / arcsec@xmath83 , thus it is quite unlikely that the actual limiting radius is much larger than 10@xmath84 . with these new assumptions the typical uncertainty on the final @xmath10 estimates grows from @xmath85% ( for the case @xmath72 ) to @xmath86% while the derived median @xmath10 is practically unchanged .",
    "therefore the inclusion of these possible systematic errors in the uncertainty budged does nt seriously affect the main conclusions of this paper ( see sect .",
    "2.2 ) , at least for what concern the cluster that provide the most interesting constraint on @xmath10 , e.g. ngc  2419 .",
    "fig .  2 reports the median @xmath10 and @xmath26 of the 10000 simulation carried on for each considered cluster ( filled circles ) .",
    "the error bars enclose 90 % of the derived estimates ( @xmath88 % ) .",
    "the most reliable points ( ngc  7006 and ngc  2419 ) are indicated by larger symbols .",
    "other mass estimates , more recent than those considered by z99 , are also reported ( see legend ) .",
    "the only pre-99 estimate reported is that by @xcite , who provides the more extensive treatment of the problem at that epoch .",
    "the filled triangle with an arrow , labeled l - b99 in the legend , provides a sensible upper limit to the total mass of the galaxy since it is the estimate of the mass of the local group obtained by @xcite using the local group timing technique .",
    "the reported error bars have etherogeneous meanings ( @xmath89 errors , 90 % c.l . ,",
    ", as provided by the authors ) and hence they are not directly comparable .",
    "the mass profiles of isothermal spheres with @xmath90 km / s are also plotted for reference .",
    "they are intended to allow the comparison of the estimates at large r with constraints provided by the rotational velocity of the hi disk at @xmath91 kpc , taking into account the whole range of possible uncertainty on the galactic @xmath92 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* z99 , and references therein ) .    from the inspection of fig  2",
    "the following main conclusions can be drawn :    1 .",
    "all the reported estimates based on kinematical data are in agreement , within the uncertainties , with the reported mass profiles and with the results summarized by z99 .",
    "2 .   all the estimates based on the tidal radii of globular clusters are consistent with the reported mass profile , within the ( large ) uncertainties . 3 .   the clusters that provide the most reliable constraint with the adopted technique ( e.g. , ngc  7006 and ngc  2419 ) give estimates of the enclosed galactic mass in _ excellent _ agreement with the reported profiles and with all other estimates .",
    "in particular , from ngc  7006 i obtain @xmath9339 kpc@xmath94 , and from ngc  2419 , @xmath9392 kpc@xmath95 .",
    "hence , the present application of the tidal radii technique provide an independent validation of the _ standard _",
    "framework for the mass of the milky way as it emerges from the analysis by z99 and from more recent studies .",
    "there is a quite remarkable general agreement among all the considered estimates , indicating that ( a ) the mass of the galaxy appears to grow with galactocentric distance at least up to @xmath96 kpc and ( b ) the total mass of the galaxy is larger than @xmath97 .",
    "this implies that the v - band mass to light ratio of the milky way spans a range @xmath98 in the radial range @xmath99 kpc @xmath100 kpc ( see fig .  3 by z99 )",
    ". hence , in the classical newtonian theory , all the available observational constraints consistently point to the conclusion that the milky way is surrounded by a huge dark matter halo .",
    "the tidal radii of galactic globular clusters have been used to obtain estimates of the enclosed mass of the galaxy in the range of galactocentric distances @xmath2 kpc @xmath3 kpc , under the assumption that , for such remote clusters , @xmath7 is a reasonable approximation of the orbital radius at which their tidal limit is imposed @xcite .",
    "the adopted technique provides an estimate of the enclosed galactic mass that is independent of kinematical data that , on the other hand , provides the basis of all other existing estimates ( see sect .  1 ) .",
    "therefore , while the associated uncertainties are still quite large , the present application provide ( at least ) an interesting consistency check of the existing kinematical estimates of @xmath10 .",
    "the estimates obtained from tidal radii are fully consistent with results from other authors and other methods .",
    "all the available constraints are consistent with the mass profile of an isothermal sphere with @xmath101 km / s .",
    "hence , the present analysis provides independent support to the fact that the mass of the galaxy grows with @xmath26 out to large distances from the galactic center and that the mass enclosed within @xmath102 kpc is @xmath103 .",
    "the present analysis indicates that tidal radii of remote globular clusters may be better probes of the galactic potential than previously believed ( ihw ) . a detailed and comprehensive theoretical analysis it is now at hand with realistic n - body simulations ( e.g. , with grape , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and can provide much sounder and solid basis to the technique . at the same time , wide - field cameras mounted on large telescopes may provide the opportunity to obtain more extended density profiles , based on star counts , hence reducing the observational uncertainty .",
    "these advancements may ultimately lead to a fully reliable additional technique to probe the mass profile of our galaxy , nicely independent of and complementary to the usual kinematical methods .",
