    "since the early investigations of mn@xmath0-acetate @xcite single molecule magnets ( smm ) are at the heart of the investigations of magnetic molecules worldwide .",
    "this is due to their properties which are governed by the anisotropy barrier , as there are slow relaxation of the magnetization as well as spin tunneling through the barrier @xcite . from a chemical point of view",
    "it is striking that until recently no compound could be synthesized with a higher anisotropy barrier which moved hopes of easy application into the more distant future .",
    "theoretical estimates pointed out that this might be due to very general reasons @xcite .",
    "a recently synthesized manganese compound put an end to more than 20 years of search @xcite .    on the theory side numerically exact evaluations of spin hamiltonians including anisotropic terms turned out to be limited to rather small systems such as for instance an antiferromagnetically coupled ni@xmath1 compound @xcite , which was investigated in great detail or another but ferromagnetically coupled ni@xmath1 @xcite . with great numerical effort",
    "the exchange constants of mn@xmath0-acetate could be determined @xcite , but usually one resorts to models where the interacting spin system is replaced by one large spin in its effective ligand field ( giant spin approximation ) . but thanks to the technical progress detailed numerical studies of larger molecules are affordable nowadays .",
    "first examples are given by the simulation of the new mn@xmath2 compound with record anisotropy barrier @xcite and by the investigation of a mn@xmath2fe compound @xcite .",
    "whereas ref .",
    "@xcite restricts its parameter space to collinear local anisotropy axes , ref .",
    "@xcite considers non - collinear ones .    in this contribution",
    "the recently developed procedures will be used to discuss the influence of non - collinear anisotropy axes on the magnetic response of a fictitious molecular compound . in order not to make the situation too complicated",
    "i will restrict the discussion to a triangular arrangement of equal spins of @xmath3 with a molecular @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "then the magnetization will be discussed for three typical scenarios given by the possible ratios of exchange and anisotropy : @xmath5 , @xmath6 hamiltonian and evaluation --------------------------      it turns out that many magnetic molecules can be well described by a heisenberg model which takes the super exchange between the moments of the ( typically @xmath7 ) ions into account . in this",
    "_ strong coupling limit _",
    "anisotropic terms appear as perturbations and are thus often taken care of by perturbation theory .",
    "but for single molecule magnets , that might e.g. contain mn(iii ) or v(iii ) ions , the situation might be reversed or anisotropy and exchange are at least of the same order .",
    "therefore , i would like to treat both on the same footing right from the beginning .",
    "in the following hamiltonian , @xmath8 the first term models the isotropic heisenberg exchange interaction .",
    "a negative @xmath9 corresponds to an antiferromagnetic coupling of spins at sites @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the second term models the local anisotropy tensors by their major principal axis which points along @xmath12 .",
    "depending on the sign of @xmath13 this is an easy ( @xmath14 ) or hard ( @xmath15 ) axis .",
    "the neglected two other principal axes of the local @xmath16tensor ( @xmath17-terms ) are usually much smaller .",
    "the last term provides the interaction with the applied magnetic field . here",
    "@xmath18 is the local @xmath19-tensor , which might also be anisotropic .",
    "-symmetric molecule discussed in this article .",
    "the remaining parameters of the model are the exchange coupling @xmath20 , the strength of the local anisotropy @xmath21 , and the angle @xmath22 of the local anisotropy axes with respect to the @xmath4 axis.,width=245 ]    since in this contribution the influence of the non - collinearity of the local anisotropy axes shall be discussed , the hamiltonian will be restricted to a simplified spin system , that is depicted in fig .",
    "three spins @xmath3 of a fictitious @xmath4-symmetric molecule will be considered that interact with one and the same exchange @xmath20 .",
    "the local anisotropy axes are also related by the @xmath4 symmetry , so that the anisotropy can be modeled by one strength @xmath21 and one azimuthal angle @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath19-tensors are assumed to be isotropic and of value 2 .      since the various parts of hamiltonian ( [ e-2 - 1 ] )",
    "do not commute in general all eigenvalues and eigenvectors have to be calculated for each magnetic field @xmath23 , i.e. for each strength and direction of the field .",
    "the magnetization is then evaluated using all eigenvectors .",
    "i would like to mention that it is also possible to obtain the magnetization without using eigenvectors by numerical differentiation of the energy eigenvalues @xmath24 , which are functions of @xmath23 .",
    "very often the investigated substance is only available as a powder .",
    "then an orientational average has to be performed in order to be able to compare to experiments .",
    "since this average can not be performed analytically one sums over a finite set of special directions . in our evaluations we use for each absolute value @xmath25 special sets of directions given by points on the unit sphere .",
    "these sets are called lebedev - laikov grids @xcite .",
    "the directions , which contribute with various weights , and their total number are chosen such that the angular integration of polynomials @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , can be performed with a relative accuracy of @xmath28 @xcite . in our evaluations",
    "we normally use a lebedev - laikov grid with 50 points .",
    "these points can be generated with publicly available software @xcite .",
    "equivalently one may cover the unit sphere with the vertices of regular bodies such as an octahedron , a cube , or a dodecahedron . for practically all examples we evaluated in the past",
    "we can say that averaging over the directions given by the vertices of a dodecahedron is as accurate as averaging over a lebedev - laikov grid with 50 points . on the contrary ,",
    "averaging only over a smaller number of directions like @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is insufficient .",
    "in the following main part the magnetic response of the spin system shown in fig .  [ f-1 ] will be discussed for three scenarios : @xmath5 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 . in most cases",
    "the figures show powder averaged magnetizations for @xmath34 degrees .",

    "@xmath22 ( solid curves ) , i.e. close to the collinear configuration , the influence of the anisotropy is strong since it acts cooperatively .",

    "[ f-9 ] one notices that in the strong coupling limit the multiplets can be well separated , but the ground - state multiplet is practically not split . in the opposite case of large easy - axis anisotropy the ground state multiplet is nicely split but energetically overlaps with other levels ( but not too strong ) .",
