    "the amplitude of this proximity - induced triplet state sensitively depends on the state of magnetization of the f material .",
    "in particular , the triplet components with nonzero projection of the spin angular momentum of the cooper pair @xmath4 can only occur when there are magnetization noncollinearities .",
    "these components of the condensate are immune to pair breaking by the exchange field and , unlike the singlet and the @xmath5 triplet components , they can penetrate deep into the f material @xcite .",

    "this solution also reveals that @xmath0 suppression observed for the orthogonal state of the co magnetic moments originates from enhanced penetration of the long - range triplet condensate into the co / cu / co spin valve in this maximally non - collinear magnetic state .",

    "this occurs for the same reason already mentioned in the discussion of fig .",
    "[ tc_thicknesses ] : the behavior of @xmath2 is very sensitive to the inner ferromagnetic layer thicknesses due to the proximity effect .",
    "similarly , we observe that the switching ranges are less sensitive to the thickness of the outer ferromagnetic layer ( see in the @xmath78 series ) and also to the normal metal layer thickness in the @xmath7 series .",
    "we now turn to the role that induced triplet correlations in the nonmonotonic behavior of @xmath2 .",
    "this has been the subject of recent theoretical interest @xcite but little has been done on quantitatively comparing theory and experiment .",
    "to examine this question in a quantitative way , we have computed the induced odd triplet pairing correlations .",
    "these correlations ( as well of course as the ordinary singlet correlations ) can be self - consistently calculated using the methods previously described . as noted in sec .",
    "[ methods ] , with the presence of nonhomogeneous magnetization the triplet pair amplitudes in general can be induced when @xmath150 .",
    "we present our study in terms of the quantity @xmath151 where the quantities involved are defined in eq .",
    "( [ alltripleta ] ) .",
    "this quantity accounts for both triplet components , the equal spin and opposite spin triplet correlations .",
    "the reason to use this quantity is that via eq .",
    "( [ rotation ] ) , one can easily show that , when the spin quantization axis is rotated by an angle @xmath107 , the rotated triplet pair amplitudes @xmath152 and @xmath153 after the transformation are related from the original @xmath116 and @xmath118 by    [ rottripleta ] @xmath154    therefore the quantity @xmath155 that we focus on obviates any ambiguity issues related to the existence of generally non - collinear `` natural '' axes of quantization in the system .",
    "we have computed this quantity as a function of position and @xmath1 .",
    "it turns out to be particularly useful to focus on the average value of @xmath155 in the pinned layer @xmath156 .",
    "we normalize this averaged quantity , computed in the low-@xmath11 limit , to the value of the singlet pair amplitude in the bulk @xmath157 . this normalized averaged quantity is plotted as a function of @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ triplet_dtc_a_all ] ( left vertical scale ) at a dimensionless characteristic time @xmath158 .",
    "this time value is unimportant , provided it be nonzero , of course .",
    "in the three panels , an example taken from each of the series is displayed , as explained in the caption .",
    "one can observe that the maxima of this average @xmath159 occur when @xmath160 and its minima are at either @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "in the same figure ( right vertical scale ) the experimental values of @xmath43 , for the same cases , which have minima near @xmath161 , are plotted in an inverted scale .",
    "the agreement is truly striking .",
    "the anticorrelation can be easily understood : the magnitude of the low-@xmath11 singlet pair amplitudes is of course positively correlated to @xmath0 . here",
    "the fact that triplet pair amplitudes are anticorrelated to @xmath0 ( or to the singlet amplitudes ) indicates a singlet - triplet conversion process : when more singlet superconductivity leaks into the ferromagnet side , @xmath0 is suppressed and triplet superconductivity is enhanced . the average magnitude of the triplet pair amplitudes in the free and normal layer regions is only weakly dependent on @xmath1 : of importance is the propagation of triplet pairs throughout the entire system , generated by the symmetry - breaking interfaces and magnetic inhomogeneity created from the two misaligned ferromagnets .",
    "this clearly demonstrates a singlet to triplet process which is related to the nonmonotonicity of the transition temperature .",
    "in conclusion , we made measurements of the superconducting transition temperature @xmath0 in coo / co / cu / co / nb multilayers in a spin valve structure .",
    "@xmath0 was measured both as a function of the in - plane angle between the co magnetic moments and of the thicknesses of the co / cu / co spin valve layers .",
    "we found that @xmath0 is a nonmonotonic function of the angle , with a minimum near orthogonal orientations of the magnetic moments of the two co layers .",
    "the behavior of @xmath0 as a function of these variables was quantitatively described by an efficient microscopic method that is based on a linearization of the self - consistent bogoliubov  de gennes equations .",
    "we have shown that the nonmonotonic behavior of @xmath2 is correlated with the formation of long - range triplet pairs .",
