    "[ tab : obs ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     note : the absolute abundances are largely uncertain , due to the unknown vertical abundance and temperature profiles .",
    "however , because @xmath6 and @xmath7 are expected to be , for the most part , co - spatial their abundance ratio does not suffer greatly from uncertainties in the vertical temperature profile .",
    "therefore , the inferred @xmath8 ratios is robust .",
    "the observed cn and hcn disk emission profiles in the mwc 480 disk are well - fit by power - law abundance profiles with a radial cut - off that is two times larger for cn compared to hcn .",
    "cn is thus significantly more radially extended than hcn , _",
    "i.e. _ we can exclude with a high level of confidence that excitation alone is responsible for the different hcn and cn emission profiles .",
    "this result is consistent with chemical model predictions of survival of cn and rapid photodissociation of hcn in the outer , low - density disk @xcite .",
    "indeed , these models predict that the cn abundance can remain constant and even increase with radius because radical formation is favored at low densities , and because cn is a major hcn photodissociation product .",
    "hcn , on the other hand , should only be present in the high - density parts of the disk where a shielded molecular layer exists .",
    "the same models also predict a different vertical structure of cn and hcn , with the cn abundance peaking close to the disk surface in the inner disk regions .",
    "constraining the vertical abundances of these molecules requires multiple line transitions and/or direct observations of vertical emission patterns in edge - on disks . in the meantime",
    ", the derived abundance ratio of the two molecules remains relatively unconstrained .",
    "the emission of cn and hcn in the disk around t tauri star dm tau exhibit different patterns compared to mwc  480 .",
    "first , the spatial distribution ( the extension of the emission ) is similar for cn and hcn in the dm  tau disk .",
    "this difference between mwc 480 and dm  tau may be explained by the fact that the uv field around dm  tau should be substantially lower .",
    "less vertical disk column may therefore be required to shield the outer disk regions , resulting in a shielded molecular layer out to many 100s of au in the dm  tau disk .",
    "second , hcn exhibits a low snr outer ring around 300  au , best identified in the azimuthally - averaged emission profile .",
    "the gap demarcating the main hcn disk from the outer ring is faintly seen in cn as well .",
    "this gap may be the result of micron - sized dust depletion at the same radius due to dust dynamics , which would enable uv radiation to penetrate down toward the midplane , photo - dissociating hcn .",
    "such a dust lane has been observed toward tw hya in scattered light @xcite .",
    "similar high - quality scattered light observations toward dm tau could resolve this question . if this scenario is confirmed , these alma observations suggest that cn / hcn observations could be developed into a powerful probe of dust distributions and dynamics in the outer regions of disks .",
    "observed towards different solar system bodies @xcite and in the ism @xcite , and the disk around mwc  480.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we used observations of hcn isotopologues to determine the level of nitrogen fractionation in the mwc 480 disk . fig .",
    "[ fig : ratios ] shows the measured @xmath5 ratio in the mwc 480 disk compared with different solar system bodies and the ism .",
    "observations of the @xmath5 ratio in our solar system reveal a clear difference between gaseous and rocky bodies @xcite .",
    "a low n fractionation ( _ i.e. _ , high @xmath5 ) is observed toward the sun and jupiter @xcite , while a high fractionation ( _ i.e. _ , low @xmath5 ) is observed in the rocky planets , comets and meteorites @xcite .",
    "isotopic ratios in the coma of comets are determined remotely through high - resolution radio and optical spectroscopy .",
    "the rosetta space mission will hopefully provide _ in - situ _ measurements of the @xmath9 ratio in the coma of comet 67p / churyumov - gerasimenko .",
    "comets display the highest @xmath1n enhancements among solar system bodies @xcite .",
    "prior to this study the only other place where such high nitrogen fractionation is found is cold pre - stellar cores @xcite .",
    "the cometary @xmath1n abundance could thus signify an interstellar inheritance .",
    "interstellar inheritance is not the only possibility , however .",
    "distinguishing between pre - solar and solar nebula origins of nitrogen fractionation requires observations of nitrogen fractionation in protoplanetary disks . in general",
    ", hcn ( isotopologue ) formation begins with atomic nitrogen . at low temperatures @xmath1n",
    "is preferentially incorporated into cyanides resulting in fractionation .",
    "observations of hcn and hnc fractionation toward protostars present a tentative trend of the @xmath5 with temperature , supporting this scenario @xcite .",
    "the second mechanism to produce an enhancement in @xmath1n in hcn is isotope selective photodissociation of @xmath10n@xmath1n over @xmath10n@xmath11 , resulting in an enhanced atomic @xmath1n/@xmath10n ratio .",
    "theoretical models have shown that this mechanism can increase the @xmath5 ratio by up to a factor 10 in protoplanetary disks @xcite .",
    "pre - stellar inheritance , low - temperature chemical fractionation in cold disk regions , and photochemically driven fractionation in disk atmospheres could thus all explain the observed nitrogen fractionation in comets .",
    "the presented hcn isotopologue observations in the mwc  480 disk can not distinguish between these scenarios .",
    "future , higher snr and/or higher resolution disk studies could , however .",
    "the three scenarios should present very different radial and vertical @xmath5 profiles .",
    "inheritance should produce an almost uniform ratio across the disk .",
    "low - temperature chemical fractionation should result in a lower @xmath5 ratio in hcn in the outer , cold disk that is still protected from radiation and also a decreasing ratio toward the disk midplane .",
    "finally , nitrogen fractionation from selective photodissociation should result in the lowest @xmath5 ratio in hcn closer to the disk atmosphere .",
    "in addition to detailed studies of individual sources , observations of the averaged @xmath5 ratio in disks exposed to different stellar radiation fields will also bring insight into the origin of n fractionation . if low - temperature chemical fractination is the dominant mechanism producing @xmath7 , then a multi - source study should result in a trend of increasing @xmath5 ratio with stellar radiation field .",
    "in contrast , the opposite behaviour should be observed if most of the @xmath7 is produced by selective photodissociation in the surface layers .",
    "these observations will reveal how frequently protoplanetary disks are seeded with @xmath1n enriched molecules , and whether additional enrichment occurs in the disk phase , changing the fractionation pattern during planet formation .",
    "the clear hc@xmath1n detection in mwc 480 after 20 min integrated demonstrates that such observations will be readily achievable toward a sample of disks in a reasonable time frame .",
    "spatially and spectrally resolved alma observations toward the protoplanetary disk surrounding herbig ae star mwc  480 clearly show that its cn emission is @xmath12 times more extended than its hcn emission .",
    "we constructed a parametric model of the disk to obtain the underlying abundance profile of the two species and found that the observed difference in emission profiles correspond to similarly different abundance profiles for cn and hcn .",
    "this confirms theoretical model predictions which show that hcn is only abundant in disk regions where the radiation field has been attenuated sufficiently to prevent its photodissociation , while cn can survive in the outer low - density , unshielded disk regions .",
    "this difference in cn and hcn radial extent is not seen toward the disk around t tauri star dm tau , suggestive of different photochemical structures in disks around low and intermediate mass stars .",
    "the dm tau disk also presents an intriguing outer ring in hcn ( and potentially in cn ) .",
    "observation of cn and hcn coupled to detailed modeling clearly have great potential as tracers of uv radiation field strengths across protoplanetary disks .",
    "we also presented the first detection of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 isotopologues in a protoplanetary disk .",
    "we modeled the @xmath6 and @xmath7 emission , and derive a disk average for the @xmath5 isotopic ratio of @xmath13 in mwc  480 .",
    "this value , which is lower than the solar one , is similar to what has been measured in comets and in the cold ism .",
    "these observations show that with the current alma capabilities it is remarkable easy to detect the faint lines of rare istopologues of common molecules in protoplanetary disks making new detections in the near future very likely .",
    "observations at higher sensitivity in mwc  480 , as well as in other sources , should allow us to resolve variations of the @xmath5 ratio across the disk , and directly address the current fractionation puzzle of why different objects in our solar system present different n enrichment levels .",
