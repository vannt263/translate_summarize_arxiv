    "the last months of data taking were dedicated to special low energy runs , with proton energies of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , corresponding to centre - of - mass energies of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . during the whole data taking period , the h1 detector recorded almost @xmath8 in @xmath9 collisions and almost @xmath10 in @xmath11 collisions at high centre - of - mass energy .",

    "heavy meson production thus depends on the gluon content of the proton .",
    "as the heavy quark mass is non - negligible compared to the scale @xmath48 , set by the exchanged virtual photon , theoretical prediction need to include the quark masses .",

    "the production of jets at hera provides a clean environment to study fundamental properties of qcd , like the strong coupling constant @xmath54 .",
    "the h1 collaboration measures inclusive jet production normalised to inclusive dis , as well as the rate of 2-jet and 3-jet events @xcite .",

    "a value @xmath57 is found in an nlo qcd analysis .",
    "the small experimental error on @xmath54 compared to the dominant theoretical error emphasises the need of higher order calculations for jet production at hera .     from jets at hera , title=\"fig : \" ]    from jets at hera , title=\"fig : \" ]        the running of @xmath54 with @xmath41 , as seen in jet production at hera and a comparison to other @xmath54 measurements is shown in figure [ fig : alphas ] .    as a further investigation of qcd effects in the hadronic final state structure ,",
    "the production of charged particles is studied .",
    "the charged particle spectra are sensitive to the fragmentation process , in which hadrons are produced from the initial state partons . as opposed to the hard process , which can be calculated in perturbation theory , fragmentation is described by phenomenological models .",
    "h1 measured the production of charged particles @xcite as a function of @xmath58 , the momentum fraction in the current hemisphere of the breit frame , in the kinematic range @xmath59 .",
    "more insights in the fragmentation process are obtained by studying particle production separately for negatively and positively charged particles . these rates and",
    "the associated asymmetry are shown in figure [ fig : cpa ] .",
    "the asymmetry is small at low @xmath58 and rises up to @xmath60 for high @xmath58 , in agreement with various fragmentation models .",
    "in contrast , the charge asymmetry observed at parton level , does not depend strongly on @xmath58 .",
    "]    diffractive processes contribute at a level of about @xmath61 to the dis cross - sections at hera .",
    "they are characterised by the fact that the proton stays intact or fragments into a system with small mass @xmath62 , even though a second hadronic system is produced .",
    "this is interpreted as the exchange of a colour - neutral hadronic object . in leading order qcd ,",
    "this is explained by the exchange of two gluons .",
    "experimentally , diffractive events are detected by identifying the outgoing proton or by requiring a large rapidity gap free of hadronic activity and separating the two hadronic systems .",
    "new results on inclusive diffraction are derived from data taken with the h1 forward proton spectrometer ( fps ) .",
    "leading protons are detected in the fps , which is located about @xmath63 downstream the main h1 detector in the hera tunnel , using roman pot detectors inside the evacuated part of the beam transport system .",
    "compared to earlier measurements with a leading proton @xcite , the analysed data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity increased by one order of magnitude .",
    "the resulting reduced cross - section is shown in figure [ fig : fps ] as a function of three variables : @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath41 .",
    "the variable @xmath65 is related to bjorken @xmath45 and the momentum fraction @xmath64 of the colourless object entering the hard interaction , @xmath66 .",
    "the data are compared to predictions from a qcd fit to inclusive h1 rapidity gap data @xcite .",
    "agreement is found , taking into account the fact that the fit includes data up to a mass @xmath67 , whereas the new data are collected with a leading proton , i.e @xmath68 .",
    "compared to @xcite , the new measurements extend to higher @xmath41 .",
    "the precision reached is of order @xmath69 at low @xmath41 , limited by systematic effects .",

    "the diffractive reduced cross section @xmath71 is decomposed into a linear combination of the structure functions @xmath72 and @xmath70 .",
    "the contribution from @xmath72 is independent of the centre - of - mass energy , in contrast to the contribution proportional to @xmath70 .",
    "thus , by analysing @xmath71 at various beam energies , @xmath70 is extracted .",
    "the quantity @xmath71 for various beam energies and the resulting structure function @xmath70 are shown as a function of @xmath65 in figure [ fig : fld ] .",
    "the @xmath70 data agree with predictions derived from the diffractive pdf fit @xcite to inclusive h1 data .",
    "it is also interesting to look for the production of leading neutrons , which are produced from an electrically charged , colourless exchange with the proton .",
    "such neutrons are detected in the forward neutron calorimeter ( fnc ) located @xmath73 from the main detector in the hera tunnel .",
    "compared to earlier measurements @xcite , the new data profit from much increased integrated luminosity and an improved fnc . figure",

    "the sum of these mc models is able to describe the data .",
    "also shown in figure [ fig : f2ln ] are the @xmath74 data at @xmath77 divided by a corresponding pion flux factor @xmath78 . at high",
    "@xmath75 the data are dominated by the pion exchange , and hence the pion structure function may be extracted .",

    "decays , the data show sensitivity to the heavy flavour treatment in qcd fits and may contribute to further constrain the proton structure .",
