    "this article centres in part around the following physical question : _ what is a d - brane ? _ more precisely , given a closed string background @xmath0 , what are the possible states of d - branes in @xmath0 ?",
    "at the level of the worldsheet field theory of open strings in @xmath0 , this is a problem of finding the consistent boundary conditions in the underlying boundary conformal field theory .",
    "as we will discuss , when this worldsheet perspective is combined with the target space classification of d - branes in terms of fredholm modules over a suitable @xmath1-algebra , a powerful categorical description of d - branes and their charges emerges .",
    "this is particularly useful for those boundary states which have no geometric description . in certain instances",
    "these `` non - geometric '' backgrounds can be interpreted as noncommutative manifolds , _",
    "i.e. _ , as separable noncommutative @xmath1-algebras .",
    "the formalism that we review in the following was developed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , and it allows for the construction of general charge vectors for d - branes on these noncommutative spaces .",
    "this point of view becomes particularly fruitful for considerations involving compactifications with @xmath2-flux .",
    "consider , for example , a principal torus bundle @xmath3 with constant @xmath2-flux . applying a t - duality transformation along the fibre",
    "gives a space which does not always admit a global riemannian description .",
    "instead , one can double the dualized directions and use elements of the t - duality group as transition functions between local patches .",
    "this is called a `` t - fold ''  @xcite . in some examples",
    ", one can show  @xcite that the _ open _ string metric on a t - fold is precisely the metric on an associated continuous field of stabilized noncommutative tori fibred over @xmath4 which corresponds to a certain crossed product @xmath1-algebra  @xcite .",
    "thus the open string version of a t - fold can be generally regarded as a globally defined , noncommutative @xmath1-algebra . performing additional t - duality transformations along",
    "the base leads in some instances to nonassociative tori in the fibre directions  @xcite@xcite .",
    "this example , wherein the action of t - duality is realized by taking a certain crossed product algebra , motivates an axiomatic definition of topological open string t - duality .",
    "this generalizes and refines the more common examples of t - duality between noncommutative spaces in terms of morita equivalence  @xcite to a special type of `` kk - equivalence '' , which defines a t - duality action that is of order two up to morita equivalence .    from a purely mathematical perspective of noncommutative geometry , the framework needed to achieve the physical constructions above",
    "develops more tools for dealing with noncommutative spaces in general .",
    "these include the appropriate noncommutative versions of poincar duality and orientation , topological invariants of noncommutative spaces such as the todd genus , and a noncommutative version of the grothendieck - riemann - roch theorem which is directly linked to the general formula for d - brane charge .",
    "all of this is defined and developed in the purely algebraic framework of separable @xmath1-algebras .",
    "it is well - known that d - brane charges and ramond - ramond fields in type  ii superstring theory without @xmath2-flux are classified topologically by the complex k - theory of spacetime @xmath0  @xcite@xcite .",
    "we will begin by briefly reviewing some salient features of this classification that we will generalize later on to more generic noncommutative settings .",
    "let @xmath0 be a compact spin@xmath5 manifold .",
    "poincar duality in cohomology states that the natural bilinear pairing ( x , y)_=xy,[x][cohpairing]between cohomology classes @xmath6 of @xmath0 in complementary degree is non - degenerate .",
    "if @xmath7 are de  rham representatives of @xmath6 , then this pairing is just @xmath8 .",
    "on the other hand , in k - theory the natural bilinear pairing between complex vector bundles @xmath9 is given by the index of the twisted dirac operator ( e , f)_=(_ef ) [ kpairing]associated to the spin@xmath5 structure on @xmath0 .",
    "the chern character gives a natural , @xmath10-graded ring isomorphism : ( x )  ( x , ) [ cherniso]but it does nt preserve these bilinear forms .",
    "however , by the atiyah - singer index theorem one has ( _ ef)=(ef ) ( x),[x ]  , [ asindexthm]so we get an isometry by replacing the isomorphism ( [ cherniso ] ) with the `` twisted '' chern character  .",
    "[ twistedchern]here @xmath11 is the invertible todd characteristic class of the tangent bundle of @xmath0 , which can be expressed in terms of the pontrjagin classes of @xmath0 along with a degree two characteristic class @xmath12 whose reduction modulo  @xmath13 is the second stiefel - whitney class @xmath14 .",
    "this almost trivial observation plays a crucial role in what follows .",
    "a natural geometric description of a d - brane in @xmath0 is provided by a topological k - cycle @xmath15 in @xmath0  @xcite@xcite , where @xmath16 is a closed , embedded spin@xmath5 submanifold of @xmath0 ( the brane worldvolume ) , and @xmath17 is the chan - paton gauge bundle equipped with a hermitean connection and regarded as an element of the topological k - theory group @xmath18 .",
    "the collection of k - cycles forms an additive category under disjoint union .",
    "the quotient of this category of d - branes by baum - douglas `` gauge '' equivalence  @xcite is isomorphic to the k - homology of @xmath0 , defined as the group of stable homotopy classes of _ fredholm modules _ over the commutative @xmath1-algebra @xmath19 of continuous functions on @xmath0 .",
    "the isomorphism is generated by associating to a k - cycle @xmath15 the ( unbounded ) fredholm module @xmath20 , where @xmath21 with @xmath22 the spinor bundle over the d - brane worldvolume , the @xmath23-representation @xmath24 of @xmath25 on the separable hilbert space @xmath26 is given by pointwise multiplication by the function @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the dirac operator associated to the spin@xmath5 structure on @xmath29 .",
    "it follows that d - branes naturally provide k - homology classes on @xmath0 .",
    "they are dual to k - theory classes @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the k - theoretic gysin pushforward map and @xmath32 is the codimension of @xmath29 in @xmath0 . the _ ramond - ramond charge _ of a d - brane supported on @xmath29 with chan - paton bundle",
    "@xmath33 is the element of @xmath34 given by q(w , e)=(f_!(e ) )  .",
    "[ mmformula]this is known as the _ minasian - moore formula _",
    "one of our goals in the following will be to generalize this construction to generic noncommutative settings .",
    "we will now propose a powerful categorical classification of d - branes which extends the descriptions provided by k - theory and k - homology in a unified manner .",
    "our proposal is motivated by the structure of the open string algebras and bimodules that arise in the underlying worldsheet boundary conformal field theory , which enable us to treat the collection of allowed d - brane boundary conditions as a certain category .",
    "open string fields define relative maps @xmath35 from an oriented riemann surface @xmath36 with boundary @xmath37 .",
    "not all maps are allowed .",
    "they are constrained by the requirements of worldsheet conformal and modular invariance ( such as the cardy conditions ) , as well as by cancellation of global worldsheet anomalies .",
    "these constraints are viewed as equations of motion in the underlying boundary conformal field theory .",
    "for example ,",
    "in type  ii superstring theory in the absence of @xmath2-flux , this is just our previous requirement that the worldvolume @xmath29 be a spin@xmath5 manifold .",
    "classically , this means that a d - brane may be regarded as a suitable boundary condition in the boundary conformal field theory .",
    "it is not presently known what is meant generally by a `` quantum d - brane '' in the underlying quantum boundary conformal field theory . in the following",
    "we will propose an algebraic characterization of quantum d - branes in the context of separable @xmath1-algebras .",
    "the crucial observation is that the concatenation of open string vertex operators defines algebras and bimodules .",
    "we take @xmath38 , where @xmath39 parametrizes the time evolution and the interval @xmath40 $ ] parametrizes the space coordinates of the open strings in @xmath0 .",
    "let us label the allowed d - brane boundary conditions by @xmath41 .",
    "an @xmath42-@xmath43 open string has @xmath42 boundary conditions at its @xmath44 end and @xmath43 boundary conditions at its @xmath45 end .",
    "the set of @xmath42-@xmath42 open strings forms a noncommutative algebra @xmath46 of open string fields as the vertex operator algebra of observables in the boundary conformal field theory .",
    "the opposite algebra @xmath47 , _ i.e. _ , the algebra with the same underlying vector space as @xmath46 but with the product reversed , is obtained by reversing the orientations of the @xmath42-@xmath42 open strings . the set of @xmath42-@xmath43 boundary conditions , on the other hand , forms a @xmath46-@xmath48 bimodule @xmath49 .",
    "the dual bimodule @xmath50 is obtained by reversing the orientations of the @xmath42-@xmath43 open strings .",
    "note that @xmath51 is the trivial @xmath46-bimodule obtained by letting @xmath46 act on itself by multiplication from the left and from the right .",
    "we would now like to define an additive category whose objects are the d - brane algebras @xmath46 , and the morphisms between any two objects @xmath52 is precisely the open string bimodule @xmath49 .",
    "this means that for any three boundary conditions @xmath53 there should be a @xmath54-bilinear map _",
    "ac [ bunassmap]which defines the associative composition law in this category . a natural guess for this map is the canonical open string vertex which combines an @xmath42-@xmath43 open string field with a @xmath43-@xmath55 open string field into an @xmath42-@xmath55 open string field .",
    "however , the operator product expansion on the underlying open string vertex operator algebras is not generally associative , and in general does not even lead to a well - defined map ( [ bunassmap ] )  @xcite .",
    "we therefore need some other way to define and compose the morphisms between the objects @xmath46 of our category .",
    "an example of a situation in which the assignment ( [ bunassmap ] ) is well - defined was worked out by seiberg and witten  @xcite ( see also  ref .",
    "@xcite ) in the case of open string boundary conditions of maximal support on an @xmath56-torus @xmath57 with a constant @xmath58-field . the seiberg - witten limit of the boundary conformal field theory in @xmath0 amounts to simultaneously sending both the string tension @xmath59 and the @xmath58-field to infinity whilst keeping their ratio @xmath60 a finite constant .",
    "one also needs to scale the closed string metric @xmath61 to  @xmath62 .",
    "this low - energy limit keeps only zero modes of the string fields .",
    "quantization of the point particle at the endpoint of an @xmath42-@xmath42 open string gives a hilbert space @xmath63 which is a module for the noncommutative @xmath1-algebra of a noncommutative torus @xmath46 .",
