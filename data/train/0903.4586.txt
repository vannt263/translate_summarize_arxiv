    "two versions of the experimental apparatus were used in this study , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp_photo ] .",
    "the first was essentially that of ref .",
    "@xcite and consisted of a @xmath0 diameter rotating table , with a maximum rotation speed of @xmath1 , holding a @xmath2 deep layer of rough sand , producing a moving roadbed .",
    "this passed under an arm which could hold either a rolling wheel or a plow blade which was stationary in the lab frame .",
    "this arrangement has some advantages for visualization and also the large moment of inertia of the table helps maintain a constant speed . in the second version of the apparatus , the arm holding the wheel or plow hangs from a rotating axle over a @xmath3 diameter roadbed which is stationary in the lab frame",
    "this version is larger and can reach higher speeds , with a maximum axle rotation frequency up to @xmath4 . in both versions",
    ", we used rough sand with a grain diameter of @xmath5 .",
    "we have previously shown  @xcite that the shape and size of the grains is unimportant to the rippling phenomenon .",
    "the density of the grains , which was not varied in the present study , is however a crucial parameter , as discussed in section  [ sec : theory ] below .",
    "[ fig : exp_schematic ] shows the arm with the wheel and plow blade configuration in detail .",
    "a light , 330 mm long arm pivoted around a point of support .",
    "an optional counterweight could be added to the end opposite the wheel or plow .",
    "the weight and transverse width of the wheel or plow can be varied , and , in the case of the plow , the angle of attack @xmath6 was also adjustable .",
    "the wheel used was smaller and lighter than that described in ref .",
    "@xcite , having a diameter of @xmath7 and a typical width of @xmath8 .",
    "the plow blade was typically @xmath9 wide and inclined at an angle of @xmath10 .",
    "the masses of the wheel or plow and counterweight could be varied between @xmath11 and @xmath12 . as discussed in section  [ sec",
    ": theory ] below , these arrangements are dynamically equivalent to a physical pendulum , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp_schematic]c .",
    "since the angle of the arm @xmath13 was small , the physical pendulum was always nearly horizontal .",
    "thus , the wheel or plow behaved as if it were a freely falling object and the natural frequency of the pendulum played no role . no spring or dashpot",
    "was used , so this arrangement constitutes a minimal suspension having no resonant or natural frequencies , and only rather weak damping .",
    "the wheel rolled freely and no torques were applied to it other than that produced by contact with the surface .",
    "the plow was simply dragged over the surface .",
    "the speeds were inferred from measurements of the rotation rate of the table and spanned the range @xmath14 .",
    "a magnetic angle sensor  @xcite was attached to the pivot supporting the arm , and its angle @xmath13 was digitized and used to find the vertical position @xmath15 of the wheel or plow blade .",
    "@xmath15 was measured with a vertical accuracy of 0.2 mm at a rate of 2000hz .",
    "the position data was acquired continuously along with data from an optical encoder that generated a pulse each table rotation .     with respect to the horizontal.,width=264 ]",
    "the dynamics of the ripple pattern evolved rather slowly , especially near the critical speed @xmath16 for the onset of the instability .",
    "it was thus necessary to increase and decrease the speed over periods of many hours to achieve quasi - static , steady state patterns . in some runs ,",
    "the speed was ramped up quickly from a standing start , beginning with a flat sand bed .",
    "this protocol is analogous to making a rapid `` quench '' into the rippled state . in other runs ,",
    "a small perturbation was made in the bed to act as a nucleation site for ripples .",
    "in this section , we discuss some of the phenomena observed , before focusing on the scaling of the critical speed for the onset of rippling in section  [ sec : scaling ] .",
    "initially , we tried preparing the roadbed by running a comb through it to make a loose , flat , granular assembly . however , if the experiment is run continuously over a period of around a week ( @xmath17 100000 rotations ) , the bed gradually compacts and the thresholds and amplitudes slowly change .",
    "we therefore used a different protocol where the sand was disturbed as little a possible . to prepare a flat bed",
    ", the experiment was run at a speed below the onset for many rotations .",
    "the results were then repeatable .     below the critical velocity for the first 300 rotations and well above critical for the next 700 rotations .",
    "]    ripples driven by either the wheel or the plow only appear above a well - defined critical speed @xmath16 . below this speed , perturbations made in the roadbed are observed to be smoothed away by the action of the wheel or plow . for speeds near @xmath16 ,",
    "the growth rate of perturbations is nearly zero , and it can take many thousands of rotations of the experiment before ripples build up . the quasi - steady state ripples which develop after the initial transient have a very small amplitude just above @xmath16",
    ". for all cases , speeds well above @xmath16 result in regimes where the wheel or plow is thrown completely off the roadbed near the crest of a ripple , before landing again on the front face of the next ripple .",
    "the resulting large amplitude ripples are strongly asymmetric , with a gradual rise on their front faces , and an abrupt slip - face on the back side . nearer to @xmath16 ,",
    "the ripples are more symmetrical .",
    "every 500 rotations .",
    "the driving direction is to the right . in part",
    "a , the speed is increasing from @xmath18 to @xmath19 ( @xmath20  2.042.09 ) , triggering a transition from flat bed to backward traveling ripples . in b ,",
    "the speed is decreasing from @xmath21 to @xmath22 ( @xmath20  2.102.06 ) , triggering a transition from 21 to 20 ripples . here",
    "@xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and the angle of attack @xmath6 was @xmath26    the plow is observed to remain in contact with the surface at all times near @xmath16 .",
    "the ripples move in the direction of driving for wheels , but may move in the reverse direction for plows , if @xmath27 is close to critical . at larger speeds ,",
    "ripples move in the direction of driving in both cases .",
    "we discuss this curious reversing behavior in section  [ sec : backward ] below .",
    "[ fig : init ] shows some representative space - time plots of ripple evolution after a quench into the strongly unstable regime . during the transient , numerous ripple creation and annihilation events",
    "are observed , resulting in adjustments of the pattern which tend to propagate in the direction of driving .",
    "[ fig : backwards]a shows a quench close to the threshold with the plow showing backward ripples .",
    "eventually , a quasi - steady state of traveling ripples is established .",
    "for sufficiently deep quenches , the pattern can display multi - modal behavior or persistent time dependence , as discussed in section  [ sec : backward ] .",
    "the final , saturated amplitude of the ripples increases with the driving speed near the threshold , but shows non - monotonic behaviour far above .",
    "it is easy to observe experimentally that @xmath16 depends on the mass of the wheel or plow , and the moment of inertia of the arm . by changing the granular material",
    ", it was apparent  @xcite that only the density of the roadbed material matters , and not the size or shape of the grains .",
    "these dependencies can be accounted for by the scaling analysis discussed in the next section .",
    "in this section , we consider the dynamics of the arm assembly and its interaction with the sand bed .",
    "we seek to identify the essential physical parameters that govern the scaling of the critical onset speed @xmath16 . to simplify the problem",
    ", we consider a strictly two - dimensional model in which the transverse width of the wheel or plow is assumed to be large compared to its penetration into the bed .",
    "this assumption was exactly true for the soft sphere molecular dynamics simulations discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which qualitatively reproduced all of the essential features of the experiment .",
    "the validity of this simplifying assumption for the real experiment will be discussed in section  [ sec : scaling ] .",
    "the geometry of the arm and plow assembly is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp_schematic]c .",
    "the position of the assembly is completely specified by three points : the contact point with the bed , the pivot position and the location of the center of mass .",
    "these three positions define two intrinsic lengths , the distance from the pivot point to the center of mass @xmath28 , and the distance from the pivot point to the contact point with the bed @xmath29 .",
    "the angle @xmath30 between these lines is constant .",
    "the angle @xmath31 between the plow and the line to the pivot point is also fixed , whereas @xmath13 will vary as the bed deforms .",
    "dynamically , the system can be described as a forced physical pendulum of length @xmath28 , mass @xmath32 and moment of inertia about the center of mass @xmath33 .",
    "the latter two quantities define another length @xmath34 .",
    "there is one additional length , the transverse width of the plow or wheel @xmath35 .",
    "thus , to describe the whole assembly requires three angles , @xmath6 , @xmath13 and @xmath30 ( which are of course non - dimensional ) , four lengths @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the mass @xmath32 and the acceleration due to gravity @xmath36 .",
    "the properties of the bed involve only one additional parameter , the sand density @xmath37 , as discussed below .",
    "the gravitational force @xmath38 acts through the center of mass and exerts a torque @xmath39 about the pivot point .",
    "the force of the bed on the arm is assumed to act entirely at the contact point .",
    "it exerts a torque about the pivot point of @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the vertical ( normal ) force from the bed and @xmath42 the horizontal ( tangential ) force .",
    "since the moment of inertia about the pivot point is @xmath43 , conservation of angular momentum gives @xmath44    the vertical height of the contact point relative to the pivot point is @xmath45 . to determine how the onset speed @xmath16 scales",
    ", we consider small displacements about a flat bed , so that @xmath13 is small .",
    "this is sufficient , since the transition to rippling occurs at zero amplitude .",
    "we treat @xmath13 as constant except in the @xmath46 term where @xmath47 . after dividing eqn .",
    "[ eq : z0 ] by @xmath29 and substituting for @xmath15 we get approximately @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the effective inertial mass and @xmath50 is the effective gravitational mass .",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath52 can be changed independently by adjusting @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath32 .",
    "they are equal if all the mass is located at the end of the arm .",
    "if the angular dependencies are absorbed into the definitions , that is with @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , then for small displacements ( _ i.e. _ small changes in @xmath13 ) we have the equation of motion @xmath56 which is simply that of a falling mass interacting with a surface via a normal force @xmath57 .",
    "this equation holds for small @xmath13 , but for larger @xmath13 , the coupling of the resistive force @xmath42 to the vertical motion becomes important .",
    "our experiments concentrated on small @xmath13 , but in subsection  [ ssec : angle ] , we discuss the results of experiments where this condition is relaxed .",
    "the mechanics of the granular road bed are not so straightforward to model as those of the arm",
    ". we aim for a minimal description that leads to the correct scaling of the fully coupled problem .",
    "much more detailed analyzes of the rheology of the granular material would be required for a very realistic description  @xcite .",
    "we consider the case where the depth of penetration into the bed is small compared to the width of the object , so that we may assume that the induced flow in the sand will be essentially two - dimensional , and that edge effects are small .",
    "this assumption is probably violated in our experiments with the narrowest wheels and plows .",
    "the sand grains were dry and sufficiently large so that they were non - cohesive .",
    "previous work  @xcite has shown that changing the grain size does not change the wavelength , amplitude or critical velocity of the ripples .",
    "therefore , the granular medium can be described by only its three - dimensional density @xmath37 and possibly by some other non - dimensional parameters .",
    "the shallowness assumption and two - dimensionality means that the density @xmath37 of the sand and the width @xmath35 will only occur in the form of a two - dimensional density @xmath58 , and that the width should have no further role .",
    "it may be possible to allow for some three dimensional effects by allowing a virtual origin correction in the width , though we have not tested this .",
    "to arrive at a plausible scaling , we examine the balance of forces for a plow or wheel moving over and penetrating the sand surface .",
    "forces between the bed and the plow or wheel arise in two distinct ways which scale differently with @xmath27 .",
    "one of these is almost entirely dissipative and the other one is almost entirely conservative .",
    "we postulate that the onset of washboard ripples occurs when the relative sizes of these forces cross over as a function of @xmath27 .",
    "we consider the geometrically simpler case of the plow first .",
    "static , buoyancy or frictional forces must be proportional to @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the displaced area of granular material . for a plow penetrating a distance @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the free surface position",
    ", they will be proportional to @xmath63 .",
    "these forces will be almost entirely dissipative .",
    "on the other hand , dynamic forces , those arising from the inertia of the sand , will be proportional to @xmath64 .",
    "these forces are mostly conservative .",
    "we neglect the vertical velocity @xmath65 as small compared to @xmath27 .",
    "ignoring constants and angular dependence , we separately balance these two penetration forces against the effective weight of the arm @xmath66 .",
    "this gives the static and dynamic equilibrium penetration depths @xmath67 as @xmath27 increases , the dynamic forces increase and the dynamic penetration depth @xmath68 needed to support the weight decreases , whereas the static forces are unaffected .",
    "since the static forces are almost completely dissipative and the dynamic forces almost completely conservative , the switch between the two that occurs as @xmath27 increases explains the transition from a highly dissipative furrow - plowing mode to one in which the plow spends some of the time in non - dissipative , ballistic flight . for low speeds @xmath27 , the normal forces between the plow and the sand do only dissipated work against friction , while for larger @xmath27 , the normal force is sufficient to throw the plow off the surface and into free flight .",
    "ripples are then formed and maintained by the periodic dissipative collisions with the surface .",
    "the onset of washboard ripples in this picture is thus somewhat analogous to the onset of skipping for a stone projected over a water surface  @xcite .",
    "a key difference , of course , is that the granular ripple pattern is built up by many passes of the plow , each of which contributes only a small , but persistent , deformation of the surface .",
    "the important non - linearity in the problem is the highly nonlinear nature of the normal force , which abruptly goes to zero when the plow leaves the surface , as is the case for impact oscillators  @xcite .",
    "the dimensionless ratio of the two penetration depths , @xmath69 is analogous to the froude number used in similar hydrodynamic arguments  @xcite .",
    "we propose  @xcite that this dimensionless group controls the onset of the instability , with ripples setting in above a critical , threshold value of @xmath70 .",
    "our scaling argument does not furnish any estimate of the value of @xmath71 , beyond the general expectation that @xmath72 .",
    "we establish experimental values of @xmath71 in section  [ sec : scaling ] , below .",
    "we will also show cases where the plow does not actually leave the surface , but still forms backward traveling ripples for @xmath73 .",
    "we have physically motivated the identification of the froude number in terms of a crossover between dissipative and conservative forces  @xcite , but it can also be deduced from straightforward dimensional analysis . if the only relevant dimensional quantities of the arm that determine the transition are its effective gravitational mass @xmath52 and its width @xmath35 , and if we assume the two - dimensional model such that @xmath35 and @xmath37 can only appear as the product @xmath58 , then @xmath74 is the only dimensionless group that can be formed from a combination of @xmath52 , @xmath58 , @xmath27 and @xmath36 .",
    "the critical froude number @xmath71 will also depend on @xmath13 , @xmath6 , @xmath30 and possibly on other dimensionless properties of the bed .",
    "if these are held constant , eqn .",
    "[ fr_def ] implies that the critical speed @xmath16 is given by @xmath75 in subsection  [ ssec : mass ] , we will show experimentally that @xmath16 , for the plow , does indeed exhibit an @xmath76 scaling . in sections  [ ssec : width ] and  [ ssec : angle ] , we consider the dependence of @xmath16 on @xmath35 , @xmath6 and @xmath13 .",
    "the wheel is more complicated than the plow in some ways as there is an additional length scale , the wheel radius @xmath77 .",
    "the displaced volume for a cylinder length @xmath35 which penetrates to depth @xmath78 is @xmath79 \\nonumber \\\\    & = & \\frac{4}{3}w h \\sqrt{2rh}~\\bigg[1 + o({h}/{r})\\bigg ] .",

    "@xmath82 the dynamic depth is the same thus the scaling of the froude number is changed to @xmath83 thus , we predict the following relation for the critical speed @xmath84 where numerical coefficients have been ignored .    to experimentally determine the relevant parameters of the model , it suffices to determine the three constant quantities that appear in eqn .",
    "[ eq : z1 ] , namely @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath30 .",
    "we supported the arm on a balance , so that the bottom of the plow was exactly level with the pivot point and @xmath85 .",
    "then the force measured by the balance was @xmath86 .",
    "the angle @xmath30 was determined by suspending the arm from the pivot point and measuring @xmath13 . then @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "[ eq : z1 ] for the suspended arm is simply the equation of a free physical pendulum , @xmath89 which , for small amplitudes , oscillates with angular frequency @xmath90 . the length @xmath29 was directly measured with a ruler , while @xmath91 was measured by triggering small oscillations , and then measuring @xmath13 using the magnetic sensor . in this way , all the parameters in eqn .",
    "[ eq : z1 ] were determined .",
    "all these quantities vary slightly with the angle of attack @xmath6 of the plow , and so were measured for a range of @xmath6 .",
    "the plows of different width were carefully chosen so as not to alter any of the properties .",
    "to test the scaling theory outlined in the previous section , we measured the critical speed @xmath16 for a variety of plow and wheel configurations .",
    "the transition speed is most accurately determined by running the system at a constant speed above @xmath16 until a steady state has developed .",
    "the speed is then decreased by steps of @xmath92 and kept at each speed for 1000 rotations .",
    "this is more accurate and quicker than starting with an initial perturbation or flat bed and observing the subsequent behaviour , as a very large number of rotations are necessary for the ripples to develop near @xmath16 .",
    "we also recorded the long - term dynamical states for a range of speeds from below to well above onset .",

    "[ fig : init]b , the threshold speed above which backward ripples are observed in the steady state appears to scale in the same way as @xmath16 , as shown in fig .",
    "backward traveling ripples only exist for a narrow range of parameter values just above onset .",
    "another distinguishing feature of backward traveling ripples is that ripple merger events , which are common near onset for forward traveling ripples , generally do not occur .",
    "this is because the backward ripples appear at the same wavelength as in their amplitude - saturated state , whereas there is a strong relationship between the wavelength and amplitude for the forward ripples .",
    "this is related to another difference : that the plow does not leave the granular surface during backward ripple motion , while such ballistic motion is always present for forward traveling ripples using the plow .    .",
    "the lower solid line shows the onset of backward ripples from the flat bed at @xmath107 , as in fig .",
    "[ vc1].,width=264 ]     with the surface , then material is preferentially removed from the downward face of the ripple and deposited on the upward face of the following one , giving rise to a net backward ripple motion . during this process",
    ", the plow does not leave the surface .",
    ", width=264 ]    the formation of backward traveling ripples is fundamentally different from the inertial mechanism of forward traveling ripples .",
    "ripples can move backward even though the sand is only transported forward .",
    "the surface flux of grains in the driving direction depends not only on the normal force , but also on the geometry of the contact region .",
    "it is plausible to suppose that the surface flux increases with the angle @xmath108 between the plow and the granular surface .",
    "initially , @xmath109 , the fixed angle of attack of the plow , but as the ripples develop , @xmath108 is modulated by the ripples as the plow remains in contact with the surface , as shown in fig .",
    "[ sketch_back ] .",
    "the result of this modulation is that @xmath108 , and hence the surface flux , is smaller on the upward face of the ripple than on the downward one .",
    "the upward face is therefore less eroded , while the sand that is preferentially eroded from the downward face is deposited on the upward face of the following ripple .",
    "thus , the net motion of the ripple is backward , while the grains are still transported forward .",
    "a similar mechanism has been proposed for the uphill motion of moguls on ski slopes  @xcite .",
    "conversely , in the case of forward traveling ripples , inertial effects dominate and the plow leaves the surface and goes into ballistic motion near the crest of the ripple .",
    "the erosion is therefore all on the upward face , while the downward one forms a slip face which is added to by small avalanches consisting of material transported from the upward face .",
    "thus , the ripples in the ballistic regime move forward , in the driving direction .",
    "in the preceding sections , we have focused on the scaling of the critical speed @xmath16 for the onset of the ripple pattern . while a complete study of the states above onset is beyond the scope of this paper , it is interesting to survey some of the complex states that are encountered above @xmath16 .",
    "[ fig : zoo ] shows a selection of such fully developed ripple states .",
    "other than the flat bed , the simplest states are pure traveling ripples , which are well described by single fourier modes . for wheels ,",
    "these always travel forward , while for the plow they travel backward near onset , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : zoo]a , and forward for larger speeds , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : zoo]c . as the driving speed @xmath27 of the plow",
    "is increased , the backward traveling ripple speed decreases , but is never zero . increasing @xmath27 results in a low - dimensional chaotic state , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : zoo]b , in which several fourier modes are excited .",
    "further increasing @xmath27 , we enter a regime of steady forward traveling ripples , but here the plow spends much of the time in a free , ballistic trajectory between impacts .",
    "if these impacts are not periodic around the table , there is some jitter between the phase of the ripples and that of the table ; this is visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : zoo]c . at still higher speeds of the plow ,",
    "a second chaotic regime is reached , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zoo]d .",
    "the phenomenology for wheels differs in detail , but is similarly complex .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : zoo]e and  f show wheel - driven ripple states consisting of two significant fourier modes which are not simply related .",
    "the two ripple modes propagate with different speeds , producing a beating effect which persists indefinitely .",
    "all of these complex states for plows and wheels are reminiscent of the multiple dynamical states of impact oscillators  @xcite in their strongly nonlinear regime .        .",
    "[ fig : zoo ]",
    "we have studied the rippling instability of a flat granular surface under the action of a moving source of stress .",
    "we considered both the classic case of a rolling wheel producing  washboard road \" and the simpler case of a flat plow blade . in both cases , we focused on the region near the onset speed @xmath16 .",
    "we developed a scaling theory for @xmath16 based on the idea that the onset of the instability represents a crossover between conservative , dynamic forces proportional to @xmath110 and dissipative , static forces which are independent of @xmath27 .",
    "we found that @xmath16 did scale with the gravitational mass as @xmath52 as predicted for the plow and for non - rolling wheels .",
    "these have different scalings due to differences in their shape",
    ". however , the predicted mass scaling was not found for rolling wheels , suggesting that a more detailed theory of the surface penetration of a rolling wheel is required .",
    "we then considered the dependence of @xmath16 on various other geometric parameters .",
    "finally , we surveyed some of the complex ripple dynamics that are observed above onset , which include both forward and backward traveling ripples , chaotic states and states with traveling defects . clearly , understanding the above - onset regime of finite amplitude ripples and their interactions will require a fully nonlinear theory of the instability .",
    "such a theory would need to go well beyond the simple scaling of the onset speed @xmath16 that we have discussed here .    throughout this work",
    ", we have used the angular position of the arm to trace the motion of the wheel or plow . to completely close the feedback loop between the moving source of stress and the state of the granular bed",
    ", we would also need to measure the shape of the granular surface and the rotational state of the wheel .",
    "this would allow us to determine the full acceleration of the wheel or plow , and hence the forces on it , as well as the dynamic response of the granular bed .",
    "the bed shape could be determined , for example , by a scanning laser profilometer  @xcite .",
    "another , somewhat complementary avenue to the same kind of information is soft sphere molecular dynamics simulation  @xcite in 2d or 3d . with this data , a realistic dynamical model of the wheel - bed interaction",
    "could be developed , leading to a more complete continuum theory of the washboard instability .",
    "this work was supported by the george batchelor laboratory , university of cambridge , the swiss national science foundation , the natural science and engineering research council ( nserc ) of canada , the isaac newton trust and the engineering and physical sciences research council ( uk ) .",
    "many thanks to stuart dalziel , director of the batchelor laboratory .",
    "the hydrodynamic froude number is given either by @xmath111 , or sometimes by the square root of this quantity .",
    "it is usually physically explained as being the ratio of a speed @xmath27 and the wave speed of a surface gravity wave of wavelength @xmath29 , all squared .",
    "of course , no gravity waves are involved in the formation of the washboard ripple pattern ."
