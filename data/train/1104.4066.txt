    "recently the cdf collaboration reported an excess in the @xmath0 channel , with a broad peak in the dijet with mass around 120  160 gev @xcite .",
    "there is no evidence for enhancement in the @xmath4 invariant mass spectrum , so that the excess is less likely to be from a single @xmath5-channel resonance in @xmath6 annihilation .",
    "also the dijets in the final state are not dominantly @xmath7-flavored",
    ". it would be amusing to speculate what would be the underlying physics for this excess .",
    "a simple interpretation of this excess would be to assume a new spin-1 particle with mass around 140 gev . in order to avoid the strong constraints from drell - yan production , this new spin-1 object better be leptophobic , or its leptonic branching ratio should be very small .",
    "there appeared a number of papers which discuss this excess in various contexts : @xcite .",
    "very recently , the d0 collaboration also reported their analysis on the @xmath8 production with similar experimental cuts to the cdf s ones  @xcite . unlike the cdf results",
    ", the d0 collaboration did not observe any excess on the dijet .",
    "however the previous results by the cdf collaboration are consistent with the analysis with larger data sample of an integrated luminosity of @xmath9 fb@xmath10 at the cdf  @xcite . up to now",
    "two analyses are in conflict with each other and we could not exclude the possibility that both results are statistical fluctuation . eventually this issue should be settled down by more data analysis at the tevatron and the lhc .    in this letter , we consider leptophobic @xmath11 , associated with gauged @xmath2 , based on our recent model @xcite .",
    "a nonsupersymmetric anomaly - free @xmath1 model was constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the model was extended to supersymmetric one by two of the present authors @xcite .",
    "( for earlier studies on gauged @xmath2 model , we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein . ) the supersymmetric ( susy ) version @xcite has both baryonic and leptonic cold dark matter ( cdm ) , in addition to the lightest neutralino cdm , thereby the dark matter sector having very rich structure . in these models ,",
    "the baryonic gauge boson @xmath12 has a universal coupling to the sm quarks , and three times larger to the new mirror quarks which are introduced to cancel anomalies .",
    "this model has a natural color - singlet baryonic cdm with @xmath2 charge twice larger than the sm quarks",
    ". therefore @xmath12 can decay into a pair of baryonic cdm s , if the cdm is lighter than half the @xmath12 mass @xmath13 .",
    "the new mirror quarks could have constraints from search for the 4th generation fermions .",
    "the masses of exotic quarks should be more than @xmath14 300 gev  @xcite , which requires very large yukawa couplings leading to landau poles at a low scale .",
    "we interpret the excess reported by the cdf collaboration in the @xmath15 channel as @xmath16 .",
    "then the cdf data provide informations on @xmath17 and the @xmath2 gauge coupling @xmath18 .",
    "these informations can be used to study the thermal relic density and the direct detection cross section of baryonic cdm in gauged @xmath1 model , as well as other collider signatures such as @xmath19 .",
    "we find that the fermionic cdm in supersymmetric @xmath1 model can be as light as @xmath20 gev , with @xmath21 ( a few ) @xmath3 pb , which is somewhat larger than the cogent  @xcite and dama  @xcite signal region .",
    "it is well known that @xmath2 is anomalous within the standard model ( sm ) , and one has to introduce new matter fields in order to cancel all the gauge anomalies when we introduce @xmath2 gauge boson which is leptophobic . recently",
    "a simple model was proposed where one family of mirror fermions with baryon number @xmath23 were introduced for this purpose .",
    "then another new complex scalar @xmath24 with @xmath25 was introduced in order to make the heavy mirror fermions decay through the following yukawa interactions , @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are the extra mirror quarks required for the anomaly - free conditions and @xmath30 s are the corresponding yukawa couplings .",
    "this new scalar @xmath24 carrying baryon charge becomes stable due to accidental symmetry , and becomes a good candidate for baryonic cdm of the universe @xcite . in the supersymmetric @xmath1 model , new chiral superfields @xmath31 and @xmath32 were introduced , lighter of which ( either bosonic or fermionic )",
    "can make leptonic cdm @xcite .",
    "also the superpartner of @xmath24 , dirac fermion @xmath33 , can be another candidate for baryonic cdm .",
    "in addition , susy @xmath1 model has ordinary lightest neutralino as a possible candidate for cdm . therefore susy @xmath1 model has a rich structure in dark matter sector . in this letter , we concentrate on @xmath2 part only , so we will drop @xmath34 model from now on .",
    "if we consider the broad peak in dijet invariant mass reported by the cdf collaboration as a leptophobic @xmath12 decaying to @xmath6 and the bound on @xmath35 from the @xmath36 process in the ua2 experiments  @xcite , we have important piece of informations on our model : namely @xmath37 and @xmath38 gev @xcite",
    ". then we can study more phenomenology of gauged @xmath2 model , both supersymmetric and nonsupersymmetric ones .",
    "in particular , the cold dark matter sector can be constrained from the informations on @xmath35 and @xmath17 from the cdf data , thermal relic density , and the upper bounds on the direct detection rates .",
    "the complete @xmath1 model has the mirror fermions and their superpartners , and they can also affect the dark matter physics through yukawa couplings . in this letter , we assume the yukawa couplings involving mirror particles are very small in order to reduce the number of unknown parameters and simplify the analysis . then @xmath2 gauge interaction is the only new relevant one , and the mirror fermions do not affect significantly the cdm physics we describe here . including yukawa couplings to the mirror particles will be another important subject for further study .",
    "we assume that the cdf data on @xmath8 are due to the @xmath40 boson production with @xmath38 gev and @xmath37 .",
    "then , the @xmath12 could be identified in other diboson channels like the @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 production processes if the sm backgrounds can be controlled @xcite .",
    "up to the now , there is no significant excess in the @xmath44 events so far @xcite , and it remains to be seen what happens in this channel in the forthcoming analysis from the tevatron and the lhc . in fig .",
    "[ fig : crosssection ] ( a ) and ( b ) , we show the cross sections for the @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 productions at the tevatron with the center - of - momentum energy @xmath45 tev and at the lhc with @xmath46 tev , respectively , as functions of the @xmath12 mass @xmath17 with @xmath47 imposing the ua2 bound @xcite . for the @xmath42 production ,",
    "we impose the photon transverse - momentum cut @xmath48 gev and the photon pseudorapidity cut @xmath49 , which are consistent with the experiments at the tevatron  @xcite .",
    "the cross sections for other @xmath35 values can be easily scaled by @xmath50 for the @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 channels and by @xmath51 for the @xmath43 channel , respectively . for @xmath52 gev and @xmath47",
    ", we find that @xmath53 pb at the tevatron , which is about half the cross section for the @xmath8 excess at cdf with an assumption on the hypothesized narrow gaussian contribution . in order to fit the cross section to the cdf excess",
    ", we can require a larger coupling with smaller @xmath12 mass . or the current cdf data could be an upper fluctuation .",
    "this issue could be resolved in the near future with more data accumulated and analyzed . in the other diboson productions , we find that @xmath54 pb , @xmath55 pb and @xmath56 pb at the tevatron for @xmath52 gev and @xmath47 , respectively . at the lhc , we expect that @xmath57 pb , @xmath58 pb , @xmath59 pb and @xmath60 pb , respectively . in order to make definite conclusion about the possibility to find the @xmath12 boson in the diboson channels at the tevatron or at the lhc , we need more thorough study on the signal - to - background ratio with the detector simulation , which is out of scope of this work .",
    "the cdf data on @xmath61 events can be accommodated with leptophobic @xmath12 gauge boson , if @xmath37 and @xmath38 gev .",
    "if we take this value in the gauged @xmath1 model , one can constrain the dark matter sector more or less from the wmap measurement of thermal relic density of cdm and upper bounds from direct detection experiments .    for nonsupersymmetric @xmath2 model ,",
    "a baryonic complex scalar @xmath24 can make a good cdm candidate .",
    "neglecting its yukawa couplings to the mirror fermions @xmath62 and @xmath63 , we can calculate thermal relic density from @xmath64 sm particles .",
    "it turns out that thermal relic density of bosonic @xmath24 is too large , unless @xmath65 gev ( the @xmath5-channel resonance annihilation into the sm quarks ) . in order to achieve small enough relic density consistent with the wmap data without using the @xmath5-channel resonance annihilation ,",
    "other channels involving mirror fermions and their superpartners need to be considered .",
    "also , if the cdf dijet excess becomes less prominent in the future and @xmath35 becomes smaller , we have to invoke yukawa couplings to mirror fermions in order to get the correct thermal relic density .    for supersymmetric case , dirac fermion @xmath33 and its antiparticle carrying @xmath66 can be good cdm candidates @xcite , because the annihilation cross section has @xmath67-wave contribution . in fig .",
    "[ fig : xbdm ] , we show the contour plots for thermal relic density ( @xmath68 ) in the @xmath69 plane .",
    "there remains a small corner of parameter space with @xmath70 gev and @xmath71 ( the red line ) which could be safe against the ua2 bound . in this region of parameter space ,",
    "the direct detection cross section is around @xmath72pb , which is slightly above the cresst bound , @xmath73pb  @xcite .",
    "there are several cdm candidates in our model , so that @xmath33 could be subdominant .",
    "if @xmath74 is heavier or the yukawa contribution is large enough to reduce the relic density of @xmath33 , the upper bound of @xmath75 could be enhanced by the factor @xmath76 . however , we may face the stronger bound from collider experiments in the scenario with light cdm , as we discuss in the below .     relic density of baryonic cdm , @xmath33 .",
    "the gray region corresponds to @xmath77 and each dashed line is for @xmath78 from bottom to top .",
    "the yellow region is excluded by xenon10 ( 90 % c.l . ) and the blue is cdms ( 90 % c.l . )  @xcite .",

    ", width=264 ]",
    "for non - susy @xmath2 model , the bosonic baryonic cdm @xmath24 has mass close to @xmath13 if we fix @xmath38 gev and @xmath37 in order to explain the cdf w+jj excess . for these parameter values ,",
    "the invisible decay width of @xmath80 will be negligible .",
    "if @xmath35 turns out smaller or if one would like to use other channels rather than the @xmath5-channel annihilation of the dark matter pair through @xmath12 , it would be possible to have light bosonic @xmath24 without conflict with the direct detection bounds . in this case , the invisible decay @xmath81 could be possible .",
    "this would help to study the diboson productions with at least one @xmath12 .",
    "however , this possibility depends on parameters other than @xmath17 and @xmath35 , and we do not consider this case further in this letter .    for susy version , the fermionic baryonic cdm could be light so that the invisible decay mode can have @xmath82",
    ". then high @xmath83 monojet ( or single photon ) with large missing @xmath84 from @xmath85 or @xmath86 followed by @xmath87 would make clean signatures of our model .",
    "note that the missing @xmath84 signature from @xmath87 makes a unique feature of gauged @xmath2 model with light baryonic cold dark matter .",
    "the @xmath88 channel could lead to a single high @xmath83 charged lepton plus missing @xmath84 , which however would suffer severe background at hadron colliders . in fig .",
    "[ fig : monojet ] , we depict the distribution of the number of the jet in the monojet production at the tevatron and lhc as a function of the transverse energy of the jet for @xmath47 and the dark matter mass @xmath89 gev .",
    "the distribution was generated by using madgraph @xcite .",
    "we applied the cuts on the transverse energy of the jet ( @xmath90 gev ) and the transverse energy of the missing momentum ( @xmath91 gev ) , respectively .",
    "the integrated luminosity is assumed to be 1 fb@xmath10 .",
    "the expected event numbers are about 4000 and 30,000 at the tevatron and lhc , respectively .",
    "the cross section for the monojet production could be decreased by a factor of @xmath92 as the @xmath35 is decreased .",
    "if the @xmath17 mass is around 140 gev , then the two jets + missing energy signals through @xmath93 with the subsequent decay @xmath94 at lep ii may give useful constraints on @xmath17 and @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "we find that @xmath95 pb for @xmath96 gev and @xmath97 , which is out of reach at lep ii .",
    "it could be studied at future linear colliders .",
    "the mass of baryonic scalar @xmath98 , whose nonzero vev breaks @xmath2 spontaneously , can be as large as a few hundred gev in non - susy case , and it will mix with the sm higgs boson @xmath99 .",
    "@xmath100 , or @xmath101 depending on @xmath98 mass .",
    "production of @xmath98 is by @xmath102strahlung ( similarly to the higgs - strahlung ) , and the production rate will be smaller than the sm higgs if @xmath98 mass is heavier than @xmath99 .    in susy case , there is a tree - level upper bound on the @xmath98 mass , @xmath103 , similarly to the bound on the neutral higgs mass @xmath104 at tree level .",
    "this upper bound however can be raised somewhat by loop effects involving squarks ( especially scalar mirror quarks ) .",
    "therefore @xmath98 can not be too heavy and @xmath105 is likely to be kinematically forbidden",
    ". its main decay will be into the sm fermions or weak gauge bosons through @xmath106 mixing induced by the one loop involving squarks .",
    "again the final states are @xmath107 .",
    "the strategy for searching @xmath98 would be similar to higgs boson search , but is probably more difficult if @xmath108 .",
    "on the other hand , our model has a light cdm , and @xmath12 has a moderate invisible branching ratio @xmath109 .",
    "therefore this could be used to suppress the qcd background .",
    "if we assume that the peak around @xmath110 gev reported by cdf in the @xmath111 channel is due to leptophobic @xmath12 , the reported cross section can be reproduced if @xmath37 . within",
    "anomaly - free ( non)supersymmetric @xmath1 model with baryonic and leptonic cdm candidates , we studied the implications on dark matter physics and other possible collider signatures . in particular , susy @xmath2 model predicts a light baryonic dirac fermion cdm . its direct detection cross section is predicted to be in the range of @xmath112 pb , which is somewhat larger than the dama or cogent region .",
    "the cresst experiment is subtle because it touches this region . if the cdf dijet excess is confirmed with its present value , it is inevitable to consider heavier cdm or sizable yukawa contributions",
    ". then the relic density of our light cdm becomes subdominant and the wmap data could be explained by the other cdms .",
    "it would also be very important to study the collider signatures of our scenario .",
    "in fact , the monojet signals at tevatron and lhc will strongly constrain our scenario .",
    "on the other hand , if this excess in dijet becomes less prominent in the future , @xmath40 or its relative modes will constrain the @xmath2 sector in terms of @xmath17 and @xmath35 , and the implication for baryonic cdm will be modified .",
    "if the @xmath35 should be weaker than the value we adopted in this letter , annihilation cross section of baryonic cdm studied in this letter may not be large enough , and we may have to include other contributions such as mirror fermions or their superpartners , as well as scalar exchanges . in this case",
    ", we have a number of additional parameters in the yukawa couplings involving mirror fermions , and mixings among scalar bosons , and phenomenological analysis of the model would be very involved .",
    "it would be a subject in the future when the situation about the cdf dijet excess is clarified by other experiments . and our discussions are complete within our model when the cdf dijet excess survives .",
    "_ note added _",
    "while we are finalizing this letter , there appeared a couple of papers @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors consider a similar model to this work , concentrating on light baryonic scalar dark matter @xmath24 .",
    "their results on the direct detection of the scalar dark matter are similar to ours , and @xmath75 seems to be small enough to evade the bound from cresst because of the small @xmath113 .",
