    "by reducing the quantum mechanical many - body problems formulated in terms of @xmath0-body wave functions to the one - body local density distributions , the density functional theory ( dft ) of kohn and sham @xcite has accomplished great success in many different fields of modern physics .",
    "no other method achieves comparable accuracy at the same computational costs . in nuclear physics ,",
    "the dft has been widely used since the 1970s @xcite . in particular , its covariant version in the relativistic framework has received much attention during the past decades .    the covariant density functional theory ( cdft ) @xcite takes the lorentz invariance into account . in this framework",
    ", the representation with large scalar and vector fields , of a few hundred mev , provides a consistent treatment of the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the lorentz symmetry leads to the unification of the time - even and time - odd components in the corresponding functionals .",
    "the lorentz symmetry also puts stringent restrictions on the number of parameters without reducing the quality of the agreement with experimental data . over the years",
    ", a large variety of nuclear phenomena have been described successfully by the cdft @xcite , including the equation of state in symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter , ground - state properties of finite spherical and deformed nuclei all over the nuclear chart , collective rotational and vibrational excitations , fission landscapes , low - lying spectra of transitional nuclei involving quantum phase transitions in finite nuclear systems , and so on .",
    "focusing on the vibrational excitations , the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite is one of the leading theories applicable to both low - lying excited states and giant resonances . in the relativistic framework",
    ", the self - consistent and quantitative rpa calculations were realized after recognizing the importance of the dirac sea @xcite .",
    "it has been proved that the relativistic rpa is equivalent to the corresponding time - dependent relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) theory in the small amplitude limit , only if the particle - hole ( _ ph _ ) configurations include not only the pairs formed from the occupied and unoccupied fermi states but also the pairs formed from the dirac states and occupied fermi states @xcite .    from then on ,",
    "great efforts have been dedicated to developing the self - consistent rpa approaches in the relativistic framework @xcite .",
    "the formalism for the nonlinear meson - exchange interactions can be traced back to refs .",
    "@xcite . for the density - dependent meson - nucleon couplings , the explicit rearrangement terms in the _ ph _ residual interactions",
    "have been derived @xcite .",
    "the relativistic quasiparticle rpa ( qrpa ) @xcite has been developed based on the canonical single - nucleon basis of the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov theory for giant resonances @xcite , pygmy resonances @xcite , and low - lying vibrational states @xcite .",
    "the relativistic ( q)rpa has also been extended to the charge - exchange channels @xcite for the nuclear spin - isospin resonances @xcite , @xmath1-decay rates @xcite , muon - capture rates @xcite , and neutrino - nucleus reactions @xcite .",
    "in addition , the relativistic rpa with finite temperature @xcite and the continuum ( q)rpa @xcite have been established . to go beyond the mean field ,",
    "the particle vibrational coupling has also been taken into account @xcite .",
    "recently , a fully self - consistent relativistic rpa @xcite has been established based on the relativistic hartree - fock theory @xcite .",
    "it is shown that not only the gamow - teller resonances but also the fine structure of spin - dipole resonances can be well reproduced without any readjustment of the energy functional @xcite .",
    "this self - consistent rpa has also been applied to evaluate the isospin symmetry - breaking corrections to the superallowed @xmath1 transitions for the unitarity test of cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix @xcite .",
    "the corresponding qrpa @xcite based on the relativistic hartree - fock - bogoliubov theory @xcite has been developed and used for a systematic study of @xmath1-decay half - lives of neutron - rich even - even nuclei with @xmath2 , where the isospin - dependent isoscalar proton - neutron pairing is found to play a very important role .    however , the above investigations are essentially restricted within the spherical symmetry . the conventional rpa calculations in the matrix form",
    "face a big computational challenge when the number of _ ph _ configurations @xmath3 becomes huge as in the deformed cases .",
    "so far , the only self - consistent deformed ( q)rpa in the relativistic framework was developed by pea arteaga _",
    "note that , even in the non - relativistic framework , the deformed ( q)rpa in the matrix form is also a hard task .",
    "there are a few recent attempts for the skyrme energy density functionals in the axially symmetric case @xcite and in the triaxial case @xcite , as well as for the gogny energy density functionals in the axial case @xcite .",
    "the full three - dimensional calculations have been carried out only using the real - time methods @xcite .    as a promising solution for this computational challenge ,",
    "the so - called finite amplitude method ( fam ) was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this method , the effects of residual interactions are evaluated in a numerical way by considering a finite density deviation around the ground state .",
    "in such a way , the self - consistent rpa calculations become possible with a little extension of the static hartree(-fock ) code . furthermore , by using the iterative methods for the rpa equation , the computation time is close to a linear dependence on @xmath3 , instead of a dependence between @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the diagonalization scheme @xcite .",
    "this advantage is crucial when @xmath3 becomes huge . in the non - relativistic framework with skyrme energy density functionals ,",
    "the feasibility , accuracy , and efficiency of fam have been demonstrated for the rpa in the three - dimensionally deformed cases in the coordinate - space representation @xcite and for the qrpa in the spherical @xcite and axially deformed @xcite cases in the quasiparticle - basis representation .",
    "iterative algorithms for ( q)rpa solutions have also been developed recently , based on the arnoldi process @xcite and on the conjugate gradient method @xcite .",
    "the readers are also referred to ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review .    therefore , it is worthwhile to develop the self - consistent relativistic rpa by using the finite amplitude method . in particular ,",
    "special attentions should be paid to the unique features of covariant density functionals , including the effects of the dirac sea and the rearrangement terms for the density - dependent interactions .",
    "these rearrangement terms are usually more sophisticated than those in the skyrme functionals , and cause heavy computations @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the covariant density functionals hold the lorentz invariance , which leads to the unification of their time - even and time - odd components .",
    "this makes the modification in the ground - state code straightforward .    in this work ,",
    "our premier purpose is to verify the feasibility of the fam in the cdft , with special attentions to the dirac sea and the rearrangement terms . for a basic demonstration ,",
    "the self - consistent rpa is established based on the spherical density - dependent point - coupling rmf theory by using the fam .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : tf ] , the key formulas of the density - dependent point - coupling rmf theory and the corresponding self - consistent rpa , and the formalism of both iterative and matrix fam will be presented . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nd ] , the numerical details will be shown with the main focus on the boundary conditions of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 amplitudes in the coordinate - space representation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rd ] , a benchmark test will be given and the effects of the box size , dirac sea , and rearrangement terms on the isoscalar giant monopole resonances ( isgmr ) will be discussed . finally , a summary will be given in sec .",
    "[ sec : sp ] .",
    "successful cdft can be traced back to the rmf models introduced by walecka and serot @xcite . since then , the popular rmf models @xcite are based on the finite - range meson - exchange representation , in which the nucleus is described as a system of dirac nucleons that interact with each other via the exchange of mesons .",
    "recently , the cdft framework has been reinterpreted by the relativistic kohn - sham scheme , and the functionals have been developed based on the zero - range point - coupling interactions @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "the meson exchange in each channel is replaced by the corresponding local four - point contact interaction between nucleons .",
    "such point - coupling model has attracted more and more attentions during the past years due to its simplicity and several other advantages @xcite .",
    "in particular , for the present study , by directly expressing the mean - field potentials in terms of nucleon densities and currents , the fam can be applied in a more straightforward way .    in this section ,",
    "we recapitulate the key formulas of the point - coupling rmf theory for the fam calculations , in particular , those related to the currents and space - component of the coulomb field .",
    "the effective lagrangian density of the density - dependent point - coupling rmf theory reads @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the nucleon mass , and the field tensor for photons reads @xmath10 .",
    "while the coupling parameter @xmath11 is a constant , the coupling strengths of the four - nucleon interactions in the scalar ( @xmath12 ) , vector ( @xmath13 ) , and isovector - vector ( @xmath14 ) channels are analytical functions with respect to the baryonic density @xmath15 ,    [ eq : alpha ] @xmath16    with @xmath17 , and @xmath18 denotes the saturation density of symmetric nuclear matter .    in this paper , the vectors in coordinate space",

    "the tiny difference between the dash - dotted and dashed lines shows the effect of changing the box size by one mesh point @xmath139 , but the visible difference between the short - dotted line and the other two is due to the different prescriptions for the upper and lower components at the same position .",

    "this substantial influence is due to the strong couplings between the fermi sea and dirac sea in the scalar channel @xcite .",
    "the experimental data @xcite is reproduced only when the dirac sea is taken into account .    in the coordinate - space representation as in i",
    "- fam , one can identify no other single - particle eigenstates but only the occupied states in the fermi sea .",

    "this confirms that these two different sets of basis are both complete and these two methods are equivalent .",
    "this also demonstrates that the existence of dirac sea does not introduce additional difficulties for the present iterative method in the relativistic scheme , while the only price to pay is that the total dimension of the i - fam equations ( [ eq : ifam ] ) is now as twice as the non - relativistic counterpart .",
    "it is tedious to calculate the contributions of the rearrangement terms in @xmath86 to the rpa matrix elements in the conventional calculations . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : vph ] ) , one can see that , for one normal term in each channel , there are up to 3 rearrangement terms accompanied .",

    "@xcite . even worse , in the rpa based on the density - dependent relativistic hartree - fock theory , the number of rearrangement terms accompanied can be @xmath189 as a result of an additional summation over the occupied orbitals due to the non - locality of the self - energies @xcite .",

    "the equivalency of these two finite amplitude methods is illustrated once more , since the rearrangement terms can be switched on or off in the same way .",

    "based on the spherical density - dependent point - coupling rmf theory , the self - consistent relativistic rpa approaches have been established by using the finite amplitude method , where the i - fam and m - fam schemes are employed , respectively .    for the fam coding and calculations , the time - odd components of the functional ,",
