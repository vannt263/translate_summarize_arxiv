    ", to viscoelasticity of complex media @xcite . in particular , molecular crowding can be responsible for the viscoelasticity of dense suspensions like cytosol of bacterial cells lacking a static cytoskeleton @xcite .",
    "the state of the art remains rather perplexed , offering cardinally different views on the underlying physical mechanisms , as we clarify further with this work .",
    "one physical picture reflects a set of the traps ( possibly dynamical @xcite ) where the diffusing particle stays for a random time @xmath4 .",
    "the mean residence time ( mrt ) in traps should diverge @xcite for the diffusion to become anomalously slow , i.e. with the position variance growing sublinearly , @xmath5 , with @xmath6 .",
    "this stochastic time - fractal picture became one of the paradigms in the field @xcite .",
    "it can be also related to averaging over static , or quenched disorder @xcite .",
    "such a continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) among traps has infinite memory even if the residence times in the different traps are not correlated .",
    "the memory comes from the non - exponential residence time distributions in traps .",
    "a quite different physical view was introduced by mandelbrot _",
    "@xcite with the fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) . here",
    ", the standard gaussian wiener process with independent increments is generalized to incorporate the statistical dependence of increments .",
    "the gaussian nature remains untouched , but the increments can be either positively , or negatively correlated over an infinite range . positive correlations ( persistence ) lead to superdiffusion . if correlations are anti - persistent , i.e. given a positive increment , the next one will , with greater probability , be a negative increment and vice versa , then a subdiffusive behavior can result . this idea does not imply that the residence time in a finite spatial domain diverges on average .",
    "here roots the _ cardinal _ difference , in spite of some superficial similarities , between the fbm - based and the ctrw - based approaches to subdiffusion .",
    "fbm emerges naturally , e.g. , in viscoelastic media as one of the best justified models .",
    "indeed , let us start from a phenomenological description of viscoelastic forces acting on a particle moving with velocity @xmath7 in some time - window @xmath8 : @xmath9 clearly , for a memory - less _ linear _ frictional kernel with @xmath10 on the particle acts a purely viscous stokes friction force ,",

    ", one must take into account unbiased random forces @xmath17 acting from the environment ( langevin approach ) .",
    "then , the _ linear _ friction approximation combined with the symmetry of detailed balance fixes the statistics of the stationary _ thermal _ random forces to be gaussian @xcite .",
    "moreover , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem dictates that the stationary autocorrelation function of the random force , temperature @xmath18 , and the memory kernel are related @xcite : @xmath19 for gemant model , @xmath17 is the fractional gaussian noise ( fgn ) @xcite .",
    "altogether , the motion in potential @xmath20 is described by the generalized langevin equation ( gle ) @xmath21 importantly , this gle can also be derived from the mechanical equations of motion for a particle interacting with a thermal bath of harmonic oscillators , i.e. from first principles .",
    "this statistical - mechanical derivation @xcite involves the spectral density @xmath22 of bath oscillators .",
    "it is related to the spectral density of thermal force , @xmath23 , as @xmath24 . with @xmath25 ,",

    "it yields subdiffusion in the potential - free case @xcite .",
    "the velocity autocorrelation function is then negative ( except of origin ) , being the reason for the anti - persistent motion .",
    "the physical origin of this feature is that the elastic component of the viscoelastic force opposes the motion and ever tries to restore the current particle s position .",
    "moreover , in the inertialess limit ( @xmath28 ) the solution of gle is fbm with the coordinate variance @xmath29 @xcite and the subdiffusion coefficient @xmath30 obeying the generalized einstein relation @xmath31 @xcite .",

    "@xcite on a more realistic case here , would lead to the conclusions which are at odds with the present theory .",
    "in particular , the theory in @xcite predicts ( for a strict power law kernel , without inertial effects ) that the escape kinetics is asymptotically a power law , being only initially stretched exponential , and that the corresponding effective power law exponent tends exponentially to zero with increasing @xmath189 .",
    "this means that the particle becomes strongly localized with increasing the barrier height , and the corresponding kinetics becomes ever more abnormal . on the contrary ,",
    "the present theory predicts that the escape kinetics tends to a normal one , even if it decelerates dramatically . for a memory kernel with cutoff , the theory in ref .",

    "the difference is however that the physical picture developed in this work suggests that the escape kinetics can be also approximately exponential when the memory cutoff largely exceeds the mean escape time . to conclude , the theory in this work is more physical .",
    "it overcomes the previous attempts to solve the very nontrivial problem of subdiffusive escape by taking a quite different road of multidimensional markovian embedding and it is confirmed by numerics .    the fact that the escape kinetics tends to a single - exponential with increasing the barrier height does not mean , however , that the diffusion becomes normal in the periodic potentials , as one might naively think in analogy with the ctrw theory . as a matter of fact ,",
    "asymptotically such a diffusion can not be faster that one in the absence of potential , i.e. @xmath221 .",

    "@xcite which , however , can not be invoked directly because of it relates to a fully quantum case , where the tunneling effects generally contribute . from this agreement",
    "we can , however , conclude that this surprising effect is certainly _ not _ of the quantum nature in the quantum case , but reflects the _ anti - persistent _ character of our viscoelastic subdiffusion which is purely classical .",
    "namely , it is not diverging mrt , but extremally long - lived displacement ( and velocity ) anti - correlations which are responsible for the observed anomalous diffusion behavior in viscoelastic media .",
    "it must be emphasized , however , this asymptotical regime is achieved through very long transients with a time - dependent @xmath226 gradually approaching @xmath3 , cf .",

    "the potential barrier height does generally matter and it _ strongly _ influences the whole time - course of diffusion . after a short ballistic stage followed by decaying coherent oscillations due to a combination of inertial and cage effects @xcite in a potential , the diffusion can look initially close to normal ( as for @xmath227 in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ) .",
    "this is due to a finite mean residence time in a potential well .",

    "this regime is followed by transient rattling oscillations due to a combination of the cage effect and the influence of the potential force . on the space scale @xmath228 ,",
    "diffusion becomes ultraslow @xmath229 with a slowly changing @xmath226 which depends on the potential height .",
    "asymptotically , @xmath230 .",
    "this universal asymptotics is almost reached for @xmath157 . , width=283 ]    very important is that the free viscoelastic subdiffusion is ergodic , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "the results of the ensemble averaging with @xmath72 particles coincide with the time averaging for a single particle done in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ a5 ] ) , see in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "however , in the periodic potential a strong deviation from the ergodic behavior takes place on the averaged time scale of the escape to the first neighboring potential wells , cf . fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "this reflects anomalous escape kinetics as discussed above .",
    "nevertheless , on a larger time - scale the single - trajectory averaging and the ensemble averaging yield again the same results .",
    "all this is in striking contrast with the ctrw - based subdiffusion , both free @xcite and in periodic potentials @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "the benefit which subdiffusional search can bring for functioning the biological cells machinery @xcite will not be questioned by the weak ergodicity breaking , as it might be in the case of ctrw - based subdiffusion . indeed , the weak ergodicity breaking is related to a spontaneous localization of ctrw - subdiffusing particles ",
    "i.e. , a portion of them does not move at all ( individual diffusion coefficient is close to zero ) , while other diffuse with an inhomogeneously distributed normal diffusion coefficient @xcite which depends on the total observation time @xmath231 , even if the particles are totally identical . numerically , or in a real experimental setup the ergodic behavior is achieved in the case of viscoelastic subdiffusion for very long @xmath231 only , see also in @xcite .",
    "so , to check the ergodicity for times until @xmath232 we run a single trajectory for overall @xmath233 ( this corresponds roughly to sampling over @xmath72 copies , in analogy with the ensemble averaging ) . for a much smaller @xmath231 ,",
    "the difference between the time and ensemble averagings becomes sizeable .",
    "hence , experimentally one can yet observe broadly distributed subdiffusion coefficients , especially if both the particles and their environments are subjected to statistical variations @xcite .",
    "however , differently from the ctrw subdiffusion , a particle will never get spontaneously trapped for the time of observation .",
    "this provides a true benchmark to distinguish between these two very different subdiffusion mechanisms experimentally .",
    "our main results are of profound importance for the anomalous diffusion and rate theory settling a long - standing and controversial issue with conflicting results of different approaches , and different approximations .",
    "in particular , we prove that subdiffusion does not require principally a divergent mean residence time in a finite spatial domain , which makes it less anomalous when the anti - persistent , viscoelastic mechanism is at work .",
    "moreover , we substantiate the validity of the celebrated non - markovian rate theory result - for very high potential barriers ( @xmath234 for @xmath44 and @xmath235 for @xmath199 ) even for a strict power law memory kernel , where it was not expected to work because of an ultraslow relaxation within a potential well",
    ". however , for small @xmath212 the corresponding borderline value @xmath206 can be so high that this regime becomes practically unreachable , at least for numerical simulations .",
    "surprisingly , the non - markovian theory result remains useful also for intermediate barriers , @xmath236 , where it predicts the most probable logarithm of dwelling times . here ,",
    "the physics is well described by slowly fluctuating non - markovian rates . for small barriers , @xmath237 , and for other models ,",
    "e.g. when the bottom of potential well becomes more extended and flat , like the potential box in @xcite , the fluctuating rate approach also loses its heuristic power .",
    "then , the sluggish approach from the bottom to the barrier crossing region determines the transition kinetics . even in the case of normal diffusion ,",
    "different power - law kinetic regimes emerge @xcite and the anomalous intrawell diffusion can change the corresponding power - law exponents , as modeled within the ctrw approach in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one of generic results is that the ctrw subdiffusion and the gle subdiffusion are profoundly different , in spite of some superficial similarities .",
    "subdiffusion in periodic potentials highlights the differences especially clear .",
    "surprising is the finding that asymptotically the gle subdiffusion is not sensitive to the barrier height , even if imposing a periodic potential does strongly affect the overall time - course of diffusion , and for a high potential barrier subdiffusion can look normal on a pretty long time interval .",
    "however , it slows down and asymptotically approaches the borderline of free subdiffusion .",
    "such subdiffusion operates within a quite different ( as compared with ctrw ) physical mechanism based on the anti - persistent long - range correlations and not on the residence time distributions with divergent mean .",
    "we believe that our results require to look anew on the theoretical interpretation of experimental subdiffusion results in biological applications , where the issue of ergodicity can be crucial .",
    "they provide some additional theoretical support for the viscoelastic subdiffusion mechanism .",
    "a further detailed study is , however , necessary .",
    "to conclude , our work consolidates viscoelastic subdiffusion and fractional brownian motion with the non - markovian rate theory and fluctuating rate ( dynamical disorder ) approaches",
    ". it also agrees with the already textbook view [ see , e.g. in @xcite ( pp . 380 - 382 ) ] , of the unusual kinetics as one with quasi - frozen and quasi - continuous conformational substates , as it was pioneered in biophysical applications by austin _",

    "<S> we study viscoelastic subdiffusion in bistable and periodic potentials within the generalized langevin equation approach . </S>",
    "<S> our results justify the ( ultra)slow fluctuating rate view of the corresponding bistable non - markovian dynamics which displays bursting and anti - correlation of the residence times in two potential wells . </S>",
    "<S> the transition kinetics is asymptotically stretched - exponential when the potential barrier @xmath0 several times exceeds thermal energy @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) and it can not be described by the non - markovian rate theory ( nmrt ) . </S>",
    "<S> the well - known nmrt result approximates , however , ever better with the increasing barrier height , the most probable logarithm of the residence times . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the rate description is gradually restored when the barrier height exceeds a fuzzy borderline which depends on the power law exponent of free subdiffusion @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> such a potential - free subdiffusion is ergodic . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , in periodic potentials it is not sensitive to the barrier height in the long time asymptotic limit . </S>",
    "<S> however , the transient to this asymptotic regime is extremally slow and it does profoundly depend on the barrier height . the time - scale of such subdiffusion can exceed the mean residence time in a potential well , or in a finite spatial domain by many orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> all these features are in sharp contrast with an alternative subdiffusion mechanism involving jumps among traps with the divergent mean residence time in these traps . </S>"
