    "the possibility of explaining the dark matter ( dm ) and baryon asymmetry of the universe within a unified picture is an attractive idea , intensively explored during recent years  @xcite .",
    "this is also motivated by the simple observation that baryons and dm give a similar contribution to the cosmic energy budget .    moreover , since both dm and baryon asymmetry of the universe require new physics , it is conceivable that they should be ultimately explained within a common model .",
    "an extension of the standard model ( sm ) is also required by neutrino masses and mixing established by neutrino oscillation experiments and , therefore , it is quite natural to look at neutrino physics as a possible source for cosmological dm and matter - antimatter asymmetry . , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the atmospheric and solar neutrino mass scales , respectively .",
    "] the simplest way to describe neutrino masses and mixing is by adding to the sm lagrangian right - handed ( rh ) neutrino yukawa couplings and a majorana mass term . in the seesaw limit one",
    "obtains the seesaw formula for the low - energy neutrino mass , nicely explaining why left - handed ( lh ) neutrinos are much lighter compared to all other massive fermions  @xcite .",
    "it is then natural to think whether heavy rh neutrinos can play a cosmological role . in the traditional high - energy scale leptogenesis scenario",
    "@xcite , rh neutrino decays are the source of the observed baryon asymmetry . in the @xmath8msm scenario",
    "@xcite , the lightest rh neutrino with @xmath9(kev ) mass can play the role of dm , with the correct abundance produced by active - sterile neutrino mixing . at the same time , the mixing between the two heavier rh neutrinos can also produce the observed baryon asymmetry  @xcite . in this model",
    ", however , the neutrino yukawa couplings are many orders of magnitude smaller than those of all other particles and somehow the original motivation of the seesaw is not addressed.msm neutrino yukawa matrix could arise as a consequence of a lepton number symmetry slightly broken by the majorana mass terms and yukawa coupling constants . for more details on the @xmath8msm model",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite . ]    as a remedy , it was proposed  @xcite that if one of the rh neutrinos decouples and it is stable on cosmological time scales , it could play the role of dm and the same mixing among rh neutrinos could also reproduce the correct dm abundance . this is possible if one introduces a non - renormalizable operator @xmath10 , a simple example of higgs portal models  @xcite , arising from new physics at some scale @xmath11 with additional couplings @xmath12 .",
    "the presence of this new interaction would enhance medium effects opening a new production mechanism from rh - rh neutrino mixing ( occurring much above the electroweak scale ) rather than from rh - lh neutrino mixing ( occurring much below the electroweak scale ) , as in the @xmath8msm .",
    "at the same time it would also be responsible for the dm rh neutrino , @xmath0 with mass @xmath1 , eventually to decay , producing high - energy neutrinos and it was pointed out that this flux could be detectable at neutrino telescopes such as icecube  @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , the icecube detector has recently detected the first ever high - energy neutrino events of extraterrestrial origin  @xcite , i.e. , that can not be accounted for by the known atmospheric neutrino flux .",
    "the energies of these events are as high as @xmath13 , i.e. , within the natural range of masses needed by the mechanism of cold dm from rh neutrino mixing , as we will discuss in detail .",
    "indeed , very heavy dm decays have been proposed to account for part or all of these events  @xcite and different constraints , within different models , have been presented  @xcite , showing that this could be a potential explanation of the observed events ( or part of them ) .",
    "encouraged by this phenomenological picture , in this paper we revisit the cold dm rh neutrino mixing scenario discussing a few important aspects and showing how to test it with high - energy neutrino detectors such as icecube and also showing explicitly how the same set up can accommodate the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe via leptogenesis , as first pointed out in refs .  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : scenario ] we review the idea of the seesaw mechanism with one decoupled rh neutrino and the cold dm rh neutrino mixing scenario .",
    "in particular we discuss in detail how in the simplest scenario , in order to reproduce the correct dm abundance with a cosmologically stable candidate , @xmath1 has to be in the range",
    "@xmath14  gev@xmath15  eev in the hierarchical case , for @xmath4 .",
    "we also discuss a few ingredients , some of which represent quite plausible possibilities , that might relax the constraints especially in the quasi - degenerate limit with @xmath16 . in section  [ sec : asymmetry ] we show how the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry can be explained in this model via leptogenesis and in this case the range for @xmath1 restricts to @xmath17  tev10  pev intriguingly overlapping with the range of neutrino energies detected at icecube . in section  [ sec : icecube ] we discuss the features of the predicted high - energy neutrino flux and its related event spectrum in the icecube detector , for two exemplary cases for which the dm mass is above a few 100  tev .",
    "we compare these results with the observed event spectrum and show that , although a dm - only signal can not explain the 4-year icecube spectrum , it could help to explain some of its features .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "in this section , we revisit the dm rh neutrino scenario  @xcite , combine all constraints using the most recent data and we finally discuss some plausible viable scenarios and the allowed range of values for @xmath1 . in particular we show that relaxing the assumption of ultra - relativistic thermal @xmath2 abundance at the resonance , the hierarchical case ( @xmath18 ) becomes viable extending the range of allowed values for @xmath1 .",

    "i.e. , we consider 3.3 atmospheric neutrino events and 0.6 atmospheric muon events . in order to compute the event spectra of the signal and the background contributions , we closely follow the approach of ref .",

    "@xmath479 ; @xmath480 , are shown ( black histograms for the flux from dm decays and green histograms for the astrophysical flux ) , in fig .  [",
    "fig : events300 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : events8000 ] , respectively . in both figures",
    ", we also show the background event spectra ( red and blue histograms ) and the total expected event spectra ( purple histogram ) , along with the spectrum obtained using the preliminary icecube best fit for @xmath473 in the em - equivalent deposited energy interval [ 60  tev @xmath474 3  pev ] ( gray histogram ) and the 4-year data points  @xcite .",
    "note that , for these values of the dm lifetime , the diffuse @xmath481ray background is well above the expected dm signal  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : events300 ] we see that the dm signal ( for @xmath466  tev and @xmath482 ) represents the dominant contribution between 40  tev and 150  tev , whereas the hard astrophysical power - law flux ( @xmath483 ) would explain the high - energy part of the observed event spectrum .",
    "the small low - energy excess of events with respect to the 3-year results can be nicely explained by neutrinos from dm decays within the scenario described in this paper .",
    "this also implies that the astrophysical neutrino flux does not have to be as soft as the result of the fit with only such a flux  @xcite . on the other hand , this hard spectrum is in agreement with the results obtained for the through - going muon sample  @xcite , with a per - flavour normalization which is slightly lower , yet compatible within errors .",
    "moreover , let us also note that the through - going muon sample is sensitive mainly to energies from a few 100  tev to a few pev , which are precisely the energies in which the astrophysical flux in fig .  [ fig : events300 ] is the dominant one .",
    "in addition , this hard astrophysical spectrum would not overshoot the @xmath484-ray cascade limit  @xcite , or the data from air - showers arrays in galactic cases  @xcite , if @xmath485 sources ( where neutrinos are mainly produced from pion decays ) are to explain this flux .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : events8000 ] we show the event spectra for a heavier dm candidate in combination with a softer power - law flux . in this case , the low - energy events can be explained by the astrophysical flux ( @xmath476 ) , whereas the prediction of the hard dm decay signal ( for @xmath468  pev and @xmath486 ) is in agreement with the highest - energy data .",
    "however , notice that the ( almost ) monochromatic flux of hard neutrinos does not translate into a bump in the total event energy spectrum .",
    "this is partly due to the particular flavor composition we chose , @xmath487 . on the other hand",
    ", the natural kinematical cutoff in the event spectrum from dm decays ( 4  pev in this case ) could also explain the non - observation of events around the glashow resonance energy ( @xmath488  pev ) and , in this case , the through - going muon data could be explained by the hard spectrum from dm decays10  pev muon neutrino ( or a tau neutrino with higher energy )  @xcite , unless one considers a much heavier dm candidate .",
    "note , as well , that the kinematical cutoff would not solve the current tension between the lack of glashow events and the observation of this very energetic through - going muon track .",
    "] , instead .",
    "let us finally note that we have not shown the results for lighter @xmath489 , usually quoted in the literature  @xcite when considering earlier icecube data .",
    "however , it does not represent a better agreement with data than the case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : events8000 ] . given the soft event spectrum resulting from the 4-year icecube hese data , decays from such a dm candidate , can not explain the entire observed event spectra anymore .",
    "as we discussed in detail , in the scenario of cold dm from rh neutrino mixing , the same new interactions are responsible both for @xmath0 production and dm decays , with much stronger predictive power compared to models one can imagine where there is one kind of interaction responsible for production and another responsible for decays ( e.g. , some tiny small yukawa coupling ) where one has in any case freedom to reproduce both dm abundance and a contribution to icecube neutrinos .",
    "therefore , finding viable solutions which are able to accommodate leptogenesis , a good dm candidate and are testable signal with neutrino telescopes is highly non - trivial .",
    "this is thanks to the possibility to generate the @xmath0 abundance when the @xmath2 is still not fully thermalised , an observation that makes viable the hierarchical case with @xmath490 .",
    "physically , this relaxes the bounds since @xmath2 can be light with a small yukawa coupling for higher @xmath115 , both things helping dm stability ( see eqs .",
    "( [ tau2bodybis ] ) and  ( [ rate4body ] ) ) and efficiency of production ( see eq .",
    "( [ gres ] ) ) .    in this way , even starting from initial vanishing @xmath2 abundance , there is an allowed range for the dm mass that , depending on the ratio @xmath135 , extends from @xmath491  gev to about @xmath492  gev ( for @xmath493 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the higher the value of @xmath494 , the narrower the allowed range of masses .",
    "for instance from the fig .",
    "[ fig : bounds ] one can see that for @xmath495  s , the case with @xmath496 would be ruled out .",
    "more generally the upper bound for @xmath1 would become more and more stringent .",
    "in addition , the existence of a dm candidate nicely combines with a two - rh neutrino scenario of ( resonant ) leptogenesis to successfully reproduce the correct baryon asymmetry at a scale below @xmath497  tev ( 1  pev ) for initial vanishing ( thermal ) @xmath2 abundance . in this case",
    ", the allowed range of values for @xmath1 narrows to @xmath498  tev  10  pev in order to have @xmath499 so that a lepton asymmetry can be reprocessed into a baryon asymmetry .",
    "a contribution from @xmath0 decays to the high - energy neutrino flux can help reproducing the icecube data in addition to an astrophysical component that is , in any case , necessary . without performing a dedicated fit to the data , we have shown the contribution from dm decays to the energy spectrum for two exemplary masses , @xmath500  tev and @xmath501  pev , that could help explaining some of the features in the current hese data .",
    "however , we have not investigated which case is preferred ( see ref .",
    "nevertheless , we do not find that a mass of @xmath502  pev , discussed in the literature , is particularly favoured with the current data and definitely it can not explain the entire event spectrum .    in principle ,",
    "neutrinos produced directly from the decays of @xmath0 via @xmath2 retain information on the yukawa couplings and might be singled out from the rest at energies close to @xmath410 . albeit challenging , this is an interesting possibility , as the flavour composition typically differs from conventional astrophysical flavour ratios . during the next years it will be interesting to see whether more high - energy neutrino events are detected , which could support ( depending on the flavor composition ) the presence of a component originating from the decays of dm rh neutrinos produced by mixing with source rh neutrinos .",

    "<S> we revisit a model in which neutrino masses and mixing are described by a two right - handed ( rh ) neutrino seesaw scenario , implying a strictly hierarchical light neutrino spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> a third decoupled rh neutrino , @xmath0 with mass @xmath1 , plays the role of cold dark matter ( dm ) and is produced by the mixing with a source rh neutrino , @xmath2 with mass @xmath3 , induced by higgs portal interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the same interactions are also responsible for @xmath0 decays . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss in detail the constraints coming from dm abundance and stability conditions showing that in the hierarchical case , for @xmath4 , there is an allowed window on @xmath1 values necessarily implying a contribution , from dm decays , to the high - energy neutrino flux recently detected by icecube . </S>",
    "<S> we also show how the model can explain the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe via leptogenesis in the quasi - degenerate limit . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the dm mass should be within the range 300  gev @xmath5 10  pev . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the specific properties of this high - energy neutrino flux and show the predicted event spectrum for two exemplary cases . </S>",
    "<S> although dm decays , with a relatively hard spectrum , can not account for all the icecube high - energy data , we illustrate how this extra source of high - energy neutrinos could reasonably explain some potential features in the observed spectrum . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , this represents a unified scenario for leptogenesis and dm that could be tested during the next years with more high - energy neutrino events .    </S>",
