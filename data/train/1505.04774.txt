    "therefore , there is an inflection point on each of these solutions .",
    "we have @xmath83    thus , the collection of inflection points satisfies @xmath84 , that is @xmath85 . as this system satisfies the existence and uniqueness condition of differential systems",
    ", any two different solutions will not intersect .",
    "thus , the curve @xmath85 is just beneath the real process on the @xmath76 phase plane .",
    "this is how we find the replacement @xmath85 .",
    "we will give reasons that ( [ replacementofmm ] ) is a much better replacement of michaelis - menten curve in this section .    in [ [ refbangheincoming ] ]",
    ", we have observed that there is a part of @xmath85 lying in the region @xmath82 which approximates the real process well .",

    "that is to say @xmath86 is a better approximation of the solution after the initial transient period , i. e. less than 0.03 .",
    "we have also done another 250 numerical experiments .",

    "this slope is just the slope of the solution @xmath122 entering the point @xmath123 .",
    "thus , this part of @xmath85 give well approximation of @xmath122 even when @xmath27 is very small .",
    "so , we confirm this part of @xmath67 is a better approximation of a real reaction .      in [ [ refbangheincoming ] ]",
