    "it is becoming increasingly clear the we live in a weird universe , filled with about 73% dark energy , 23% dark matter and only some 4% ordinary matter ( bennett 2003 , spergel 2003 ) .",
    "one expectation from this `` low density '' cosmological model is that large scale structures formed early in time . a number of cluster surveys are designed to find high redshift clusters of galaxies in optical and radio wavelengths ( e.g. shectman 1996 , kurk 2001 ) to provide independent cosmological constraints . in x - rays ,",
    "clusters are identified by the diffuse thermal emission from the intracluster gas , which in fact accounts for most of their baryonic mass .",
    "a number of x - ray surveys have been very successful in finding clusters , determining their physical properties and using them as cosmological tools ( e.g. vikhlinin 1998 , vikhlinin 2002a ) .    , because of its exquisite mirrors ( van speybroeck 1997 ) and detectors ( garmire , in preparation ) , started a new era of cluster research .",
    "the sub - arcsecond point spread function and low background of allowed detailed studies of low redshift x - ray bright clusters ( e.g. mcnamara 2000 , fabian 2000 ) and also led to the discovery of the highest redshift cluster candidate ( at z = 1.78 , fabian 2001 ) .",
    "while the clustering properties of low redshift clusters are used to determine cosmological parameters ( e.g. bahcall 1999 , schuecher 2001 ) , just the number density of hot , high redshift clusters can also provide constraints to the matter density of the universe ( donahue 1998 , fabian 2001 ) .",
    "for example , the existence of z=1.78 cluster with temperature of @xmath4 kev is inconsistent with a @xmath5 universe ( fabian 2001 ) .",
    "finding hot , x - ray clusters at high redshifts , therefore , becomes important .",
    "here we report a serendipitous discovery of a cluster candidate traced by hot intracluster medium around quasar pair um425 a & b at z=1.47 .",
    "this quasar pair , separated by @xmath6 , was discovered by meylan & djorgovski ( 1989 ) as a gravitational lens candidate because of the unusually large luminosity of the brighter of the pair and its relatively large redshift .",
    "ever since , whether the pair represents lensed or binary quasars has been a matter of debate . to cause such a wide angle separation a massive cluster of galaxies along the line sight would be required , but none was found down to a limiting magnitude of @xmath7 ( courbin 1995 ) .",
    "um425 a & b also happen to be broad absorption line quasars ( balqsos ) .",
    "balqsos are extremely faint x - ray sources , and in pre - era , x - ray spectroscopy of balqsos was practically impossible ( mathur 2000 and references there in ) . with , many balqsos were detected in x - rays ( green 2001 , gallagher 2002 ) , but spectroscopy was feasible for only a handful of them .",
    "the original objective behind our proposal was to study the x - ray spectrum of um425 a , taking advantage its unusual brightness .",
    "while the main focus of this paper is the unexpected discovery of diffuse intracluster medium , we also briefly discuss the balqsos . a cosmological model with @xmath8 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 is used throughout the paper .",
    "we observed um425 with on 13 december 2001 for a exposure time of 110 ksec .",
    "the advanced ccd imaging camera for spectroscopy ( acis - s , c. r. canizares in preparation ) was used at the nominal aimpoint .",
    "the data were reduced in a standard manner using interactive analysis software ( ciao version 2.3 , elvis , m. in preparation ) and following the thread for imaging analysis .",
    "figure 2 shows the soft band ( 0.33 kev ) image of the field .",
    "the quasars um425 a & b are clearly detected with @xmath11 and @xmath12 net , background subtracted counts each in the broad band ( 0.38 kev ) .",
    "in addition , faint extended emission is clearly seen extending to west - southwest of um425 a. contours of 2,3,4,5 and 6 times the background are overlayed on the image showing the extent and significance of the diffuse emission .",
    "figure 2 shows the adaptively smoothed image of the field in the soft band created using ciao tool * csmooth * and used to generate the contours mentioned above .",
    "we used a gaussian smoothing function with a threshold of 2@xmath13 .",
    "the smooth image was then divided by the smoothed exposure map .",
    "the resulting image is displayed in figure 2 and clearly shows the diffuse emission .",
    "the diffuse emission is somewhat elliptical in shape and extends to about @xmath14 west - southwest of um425 a with total extent of about @xmath0 .",
    "this corresponds to about 140 kpc at z=1.47 .",
    "because of the presence of the strong point source ( um425 a ) , it is difficult to determine the exact number of counts from the diffuse emission .",
    "first , we extracted counts from a smaller region well outside the area occupied by the point sources .",
    "then we scaled these counts by the area of the entire diffuse emission as shown in figures 1 and 2 . in this way",
    "we estimate 130 counts from the diffuse emission .",
    "background counts from a region of same size are estimated to be about 38 . with @xmath15 net counts ,",
    "the diffuse emission is thus highly significant at @xmath16 level .    as another method of estimating the total counts from the diffuse emission",
    ", we extracted all counts from an annular region surrounding um425 a. the inner @xmath17 core of the bright point source was excluded , and the extraction region extended out to a radius of 12 arcsec , completely covering the apparent extent of the diffuse emission .",
    "we then used the chart and marx tools to simulate the point spread function ( psf ) of um425 a , and used the same region described above to extract the counts from the outer wings of the simulated psf .",
    "there were @xmath18 counts in the image extraction region , @xmath19 in the simulated psf region , and @xmath12 in um425 b , resulting in @xmath20 net counts from the diffuse emission , consistent with the estimate above .    for spectral analysis",
    ", we used only the counts from the small extraction region defined above , which is about half the size of the total area of the diffuse emission . with just 46 net counts",
    ", spectral shape can not be determined accurately .",
    "nevertheless , we performed spectral analysis to obtain rough estimate of the temperature of the diffuse plasma using _ sherpa _ spectral fitting package within ciao . using raymond - smith thermal plasma model , and fixing the abundance to 0.1 solar and foreground absorbing column to galactic ( @xmath21 atoms @xmath22 )",
    ", we find the best fit temperature to be 2.1 kev at the redshift of the cluster , assumed to be z=1.47 .",
    "this estimate is highly uncertain , with lower limit on the rest frame temperature being @xmath23 @xmath24 kev with 90% confidence ; upper limit is unconstrained . assuming the rest frame temperature of @xmath25 kev , the observed unabsorbed flux is @xmath26 and @xmath27 erg s@xmath3 @xmath22 .",
    "because balqsos are believed to be highly absorbed sources , we used absorbed power - law models to fit their x - ray spectra .",
    "the presence of excess soft photons , however , often points to partial covering of the source by absorbing material ( see grupe , mathur & elvis 2003 for detailed procedure of spectral analysis that we follow ) . for um425",
    "a , the best fit spectrum ( @xmath28 for 112 degrees of freedom ) yields following parameters : power - law slope @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , column density at the source n@xmath31 @xmath22 and the covering fraction @xmath32 .",
    "this spectrum , and those of other balqsos , show that strong absorption is the main cause of their x - ray faintness ( grupe 2003 , green 2001 , gallagher 2001 ) .",
    "um425 b has too few counts for accurate spectral analysis , but we can test whether the um425 a spectrum provides adequate description of um425 b data .",
    "keeping all other parameters constant , and allowing only normalization to be the free parameter , the fit is not good with too few counts around a kev compared to the model .",
    "if we allow both normalization and absorbing column density to vary , then the resulting n@xmath33 @xmath22 , over an order of magnitude higher than that in the a component . alternatively , keeping the n@xmath34 constant as in component a , but allowing the covering fraction to vary , leads to @xmath35 reaching the hard limit of @xmath36 .",
    "thus the spectra of um425 a & b are found to be inconsistent .",
    "observations of um425 field led to the discovery of hot intracluster medium around the quasar pair .",
    "high - z clusters are rare , and so are the large separation quasar pairs ; chance association of these two uncommon phenomena is unlikely . is the x - ray cluster at the redshift of the quasars , hosting the pair , or is it the foreground lens ? aldcroft ( 2003 ) have shown that to produce the large observed separation between the quasar pair , the minimum cluster temperature will have to be @xmath37 , with luminosity @xmath38 erg s@xmath3 at z=0.5 resulting in observed flux of @xmath39 erg s@xmath3 @xmath22 .",
    "given the uncertainty , we can not rule out the temperature of 1.5 kev at z=0.5 ( @xmath40 ) . however , if the observed cluster has this temperature at z=0.5 , the resulting flux is @xmath41 and @xmath42 erg s@xmath3 @xmath22 .",
    "thus the observed x - ray flux is over five times fainter than the minimum flux estimated for the foreground lens , so the x - ray cluster is unlikely to be the lower redshift lensing cluster .",
    "um425 field has been a target of cluster searches because the quasar pair was thought to be lensed and because there is a small overdensity of galaxies in the field , suggestive of a foreground cluster ( meylan & djorgovski 1989 , corbin 1995 ) .",
    "however , no such cluster is found .",
    "this also suggests that the x - ray cluster reported here is at a much higher redshift .",
    "deep imaging and spectroscopic studies will be required to confirm the redshift of the x - ray cluster , but it is highly likely to be at the redshift of the quasars , hosting the pair .",
    "this is exciting , because only one other cluster at a higher redshift is known ( fabian 2001 )    assuming the cluster to be at z=1.47 , we find its size to be 140 kpc and luminosity @xmath43 erg s@xmath3 and @xmath44 erg s@xmath3 for temperature kt=2.1 kev .",
    "these values of temperature and luminosity lie right on the l@xmath45t relation for low redshift groups and cluster ( mulchaey & zabludoff 1998 ) , which is remarkable given the large uncertainty determination of both the quantities and possible evolution of the l@xmath45t relation with redshift ( vikhlinin 2002b ) .",
    "the luminosity is at the lower end of that found for clusters .",
    "the observed size of the diffuse emission , however , is small , more like that of a group .",
    "the faint diffuse emission that we detect must trace the more luminous intracluster gas from the cluster core .",
    "our estimates of temperature and luminosity may then be considered as lower limits .",
    "given the serendipitous nature of this discovery , we can not determine the space density of such hot high redshift clusters .",
    "the presence of a few such clusters on the sky at redshifts of about 1.5 and higher is consistent with the currently popular cosmological model with @xmath9 and @xmath10 , but we can not rule out the @xmath46 model based on just this observation with poor temperature constraint ( c.f .",
    "fabian 2001 , who find that the maximum number of collapsed objects with temperature larger than 10 kev to be about 100 for redshifts higher than z=1.8 ) .",
    "the association of the x - ray cluster with the quasars also implies that they are just a pair of quasars , not lensed images of the same quasar .",
    "this interpretation is also supported by the different x - ray spectra of the two objects ( though , in principle , slightly different sightlines to the nuclear x - ray source can explain the observed difference ) .",
    "we can also explain the unusual brightness of um425 a without invoking lens magnification .",
    "association of um425 a & b with the x - ray cluster , and observations by martini ( 2002 ) who found high fraction of agns in cluster abell 2104 , suggests that a cluster environment is conducive for triggering of agn activity .",
    "um425 a is about two magnitudes brighter than other quasars at similar redshifts ( aldcroft 2003 ) .",
    "czerny ( 1997 ) have shown that most quasars usually radiate at @xmath47 of their eddington luminosity .",
    "if um425 a is radiating at close to eddington limit , it can easily have an order of magnitude larger luminosity for similar black hole mass and radiative efficeincy .",
    "such a high accretion rate relative to eddington may be related to the recent triggering of the quasar ( mathur 2000 ) and supports the hypothesis that balqsos represent an early phase in quasar lifetimes ( canalizo & stockton 2001 , fabian 1999 , becker 2000 ) .",
    "if the fraction of quasars with unusually high luminosity is small , it may imply that the high accretion phase does not last long .",
    "the faint b component was only discovered because of its close proximity to um425 a.    to summarize , our observations led to two interesting results .",
    "first , the discovery of a cluster candidate with second highest redshift and second , evidence suggesting a connection between cluster environment and quasar activity and supporting evolutionary hypothesis to understand the balqso phenomenon .",
    "we are grateful to the entire and nasa community for a superb mission .",
    "we thank david weinberg , brian mcnamara & brad peterson for useful discussions and tom aldcroft & paul green for their contribution to our proposal .",
