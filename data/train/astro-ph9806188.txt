    "planets are thought to form from the dusty disks that are the remnants of star formation ( shu , adams , & lizano 1987 ; lissauer & stewart 1993 ) .",
    "the timescale for planet formation is uncertain , but is currently thought to be roughly 10 myr , as judged from both astronomical and solar system constraints ( strom et al .",
    "1989 ; strom , edwards , & skrutskie 1993 ; podosek & cassen 1994 ) .",
    "this suggests that the young t tauri stars of ages of 1 myr , which frequently have optically - thick , actively - accreting disks ( bertout 1989 ; hartmann & kenyon 1996 ) , represent a stage prior to the main epoch of planet formation . in contrast , the dust envelopes or disks of the so - called vega - like objects ( backman & paresce 1993 ) , main sequence stars whose ages could be as large as 1 gyr , are thought to be much more evolved ; most of the dust has coagulated into planets or planetesimals , and the remaining dust in the optically - thin disk is continually replenished by collisions between larger bodies ( nakano 1988 ; backman & paresce 1993 ) .    to date the dust cloud of one vega - like object , the nearby main - sequence a star @xmath3 pictoris , has been imaged in scattered light with sufficient resolution and sensitivity to show disk structure ( smith & terrile 1984 ) ; the dusty disk is also observable in spatially - resolved mid - infrared thermal dust emission ( telesco et al .",

    "we report imaging observations of thermal dust emission for another vega - like a star , hr 4796a .",
    "this star has a dust excess spectrum qualitatively similar to that of @xmath3  pic , and its dust luminosity to stellar luminosity ratio is about twice that of @xmath3  pic ( @xmath5 ; jura 1991 ; jura et al .",
    "1993 ; gillett 1986 ) .",
    "our @xmath6 m images show a disk , apparently seen nearly edge - on and with a position angle nearly aligned with the m star companion .",
    "the disk has an observed outer radius of 110 au , comparable to that of t tauri stars ( dutrey et al .",
    "1995 ) . this result has been found independently and simultaneously by koerner et al .",
    "hr 4796 was observed in march 1998 with the 4-m blanco telescope at cerro tololo interamerican observatory using the oscir mid - infrared camera .",
    "oscir uses a 128@xmath7128 si : as blocked impurity band ( bib ) detector developed by boeing . on the ctio 4-m telescope",
    ", oscir has a plate scale of 0.183/pixel , which gives a field of view of 23@xmath723  .",
    "our observations were made using the standard chop / nod technique with a chopper throw of 25  in declination .",
    "images of hr 4796 were obtained in the k(2.2 @xmath8 m ) , n(10.8 @xmath8 m ) , and ihw18(18.2 @xmath8 m ) bands , and flux calibrated using the standard star @xmath9 cru .",
    "total on - source integration times for hr 4796 were 648 seconds in k , 1800 seconds in n , and 1800 seconds in ihw18 .",
    "additional information on oscir is available on the world - wide web at www.astro.ufl.edu / iag/.    in the ihw18 band , the dust disk surrounding hr 4796a is clearly resolved along the major axis and marginally resolved along the minor axis ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the disk appears nearly edge - on in our images ; considering our point - spread function , we estimate an angular diameter of 3  , consistent with the 5  upper limit from jura et al .",
    "we measure a total flux of @xmath10 jy in a 3  aperture around hr 4796a .",
    "the position angle of the disk is @xmath1 .    in the n - band , hr 4796a",
    "is marginally resolved along the direction of the disk s major axis , and not resolved perpendicular to it ( figure 2 ) .",
    "this result is as expected given our sensitivity limits , and given that the dust excess at that wavelength is small in comparison to the stellar photospheric emission ( jura et al .",
    "our n - band flux measurement of @xmath11 mjy in a 3  aperture agrees well with that of jura et al .",
    "we place a 3@xmath12 upper limit of 23 mjy at n on the flux from b , consistent with the 65 mjy limit reported by jura et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .    in the k - band , both hr 4796a and b are point sources with fwhm not appreciably larger than that of the standard star",
    "the infrared excess of hr 4796a can be fit by a blackbody at 110 k ; the absence of shorter - wavelength emission apparently requires a depletion or absence of dust inside of @xmath13 au ( jura et al . 1993 ) . to see whether our images are consistent with the inference of an inner disk hole ,",
    "we have constructed preliminary dust disk models for hr 4796a .",
    "these models assume that the disk is optically and geometrically thin .",
    "we also adopt power - law distributions of surface density and temperature . using a power - law dependence of the dust opacity on frequency at wavelengths @xmath14 m",
    ", we require that the models reproduce the infrared spectrum ( jura et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the @xmath15 m stellar flux is extrapolated from the @xmath16 m flux . finally , the _ hipparchos _ distance of 67.1@xmath17 pc is used , consistent with the main sequence spectral type of a0v ( @xmath18 , effective temperature @xmath19  9500k ; jura et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "because we only marginally resolve the disk along the minor axis , we have chosen to compare the models only with the strip surface brightness distribution , summed along the minor axis .",
    "we formally adopt an inclination angle of @xmath20 to be consistent with the observations , but since the disk is optically thin , this parameter makes no difference to the strip surface brightness .    within the context of this simple model , an inner hole or region of dust depletion",
    "is needed to avoid having too large a central peak in the emission .",
    "as shown in figure 3 , models with constant surface density require an inner hole radius @xmath21  au .",
    "the surface density distribution as a function of cylindrical radius @xmath22 is not well constrained ; models with @xmath23 , with @xmath24 , are consistent with the data ( figure 3 ) .",
    "although our model results are not unique , we note that the derived parameters are very similar to those inferred for the @xmath3  pic disk by pantin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . by modelling their 10@xmath8 m data , pantin et al .",
    "find a relatively constant surface density between about 50 and 100 au , with rapid decreases to shorter and larger radial distances .",
    "thus , the size of inner hole inferred here for hr 4796a is similar to the inner hole radius estimated for @xmath3  pic .",
    "all of the models require dust temperatures of @xmath25  k at 100 au , which is much higher than the blackbody grain temperature of 60 k at this distance ( jura et al .",
    "this suggests that the grains must have reduced efficiency of emission at mid - infrared wavelengths .",
    "we have therefore adopted a power law opacity of @xmath26 , so that the models all have a radiative equilbrium temperature distribution @xmath27 .",
    "calculations suggest that circumstellar disks will be truncated by the tidal effects of a companion star in circular orbit at approximately 0.9 of the average roche lobe radius ( artymowicz & lubow 1994 ) , which for the estimated mass ratio of this object should be slightly more than half the orbital radius ( papaloizou & pringle 1977 ) . in the present case",
    "this suggests the disk should be truncated at about 270 au rather than the observed 110 au .",
    "our simple model ( figure 3 ) suggests that @xmath28 m image does not trace emission from the outermost , coldest regions of the disk very well ( the outer radius of our models is 200 au ) , so that the disk may extend well beyond what we can detect at 18  @xmath8 m .",
    "alternatively , it may be that the orbit of the companion is eccentric , and that the m star is currently near apastron .    at an angular separation of approximately 7.7 arcsec , the companion ( spectral type m2.5 ; stauffer et al .",
    "1995 @xmath29 shb ) star must be a physical partner because the stars have not changed their relative positions for more than 60 yr ( jura et al .",
    "as discussed by shb , the difficulty in assigning an age to the m star derives mostly from calibrations of theoretical evolutionary tracks . in effect , shb use the distance above the pleiades main sequence in the hr diagram to provide the calibration , and find an age of @xmath30  myr . here",
    "we consider the effect of the new _ hipparcos _ distance on this result .",
    "we adopt the temperature scale and bolometric corrections adopted by briceo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , along with the i ( cousins ) magnitude reported by jura et al .",
    "( 1993 ) to determine an effective temperature of @xmath31  k and luminosity @xmath32 for hr 4796b . then , using the @xmath33 distance , and the dantona & mazzitelli ( 1994 ) evolutionary tracks ( for which the above temperature scale is valid ) , the resulting age is @xmath34  myr and the estimated mass is @xmath35 .",
    "this is virtually identical to the shb result ; the ( small ) change in distance is compensated for by the change in bolometric correction . as noted by shb , the measurement of the strong li absorption line at 670.7 nm constrains the age to be less than @xmath36  myr for this mass range ( see , e.g. , dantona & mazzitelli 1994 ) . a lower limit to the age of a few myr is indicated by the isolated location of hr 4796 , since most stars of comparable or smaller ages are found in regions of molecular clouds and substantial interstellar dust extinction ( leisawitz , bash , & thaddeus 1989 ) .",
    "the inner disk hole has been attributed variously to either the tidal effects of a `` sweeper '' planet or brown dwarf , or to inward migration of dust due to poynting - robertson ( pr ) drag , followed by sublimation of ice grains near 30 au ( see jura et al .",
    "our observations do not constrain these possibilities .",
    "the observations suggest a flatter surface density distribution outside of the hole than in @xmath3 pic , which may indicate qualitatively different conditions .",
    "we note that our upper limit of 23 mjy to the flux at 10.8 @xmath8 m from the m star is consistent with the predicted photospheric flux of @xmath37  mjy , implying little if any dust emission from a potential disk around the companion .",
    "this is consistent with the m star being a weak - emission t tauri star , which are not thought to be accreting from inner disks ( bertout 1989 ) .    in the case of most",
    "vega - like systems , it is assumed that the dust grains responsible for the far - infrared excess emission must be continually replenished by collisions and sublimation of larger bodies , because the timescales for orbital decay by poynting - robertson ( pr ) effect and sublimation of small bodies near the inner disk edge are smaller than the stellar main sequence lifetimes ( nakano 1988 ; backman & paresce 1993 ) .",
    "the hr 4796 system is so young that this conclusion may not be applicable .",
    "jura et al .",
    "( 1998 ) suggested that the grains need to be larger than @xmath38 m in order not to be removed from the disk by pr drag .",
    "however , radiative equilibrium for such large grains should be close to the blackbody case , resulting in lower dust temperatures and making it much more difficult to explain the size of the 18  @xmath8 m image , as noted above .",
    "it is possible that small grains might be produced by collisions of larger bodies , as suggested for @xmath3  pic ( see backman & paresce 1993 ) ; alternatively , if sufficient gas remains in the disk , as might be expected for a young system , pr drag can be overcome by gas drag .",
    "attempts to measure gas directly in this disk should be made to see if the amounts are as small as found for @xmath3 pic ( e.g. , ferlet , hobbs , & vidal - madjar 1987 ) .",
    "finally , it may be that there is not a universal evolutionary timescale for protoplanetary disks , especially when the influence of companion stars is taken into account .",
    "highly - simplified viscous disk models which are consistent with t tauri star mass accretion rates suggest that the decay in disk mass as a function of time might be relatively slow for isolated stars , leaving 0.001 - 0.01 @xmath39 of gas in a disk of 1000 au radius at an age of 10 myr ( hartmann et al .",
    "in contrast , the mass of circumstellar dust in hr 4796a is estimated to be only @xmath40 - @xmath41  g ( jura et al .",
    "1995 , 1998 ) .",
    "however , the presence of a companion star at 500 au is likely to dramatically accelerate the depletion of the disk due to accretion onto the central star ( papaloizou & lin 1995 ) . the disk around hr 4796 can serve as a valuable laboratory for understanding disk evolution and planet formation .",
