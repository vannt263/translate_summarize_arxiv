    "processes of galaxy mass assembly at early epoch is one amongst the largest open issues in galaxy evolution . to tackle this question",
    "several mechanisms related to the environment should be first understood , e.g. the role of major and/or minor , wet and/or dry mergers versus smooth cold gas accretion along cosmic filaments . on the other hand",
    ", the actual impact of feedback from sne and agns activities and the secular galaxy evolution should also play a major role in the way the baryonic matter is redistributed within - or ejected from - the galaxies .",
    "the knowledge of numerous physical parameters is needed to constrain scenarios of galaxy mass assembly .",
    "number of global parameters could be achieved from global measurements but resolved measurements within individual galaxies extracted from 3d - spectral analysis are necessary to measure the radial distributions of the metallicity , the star formation , the stellar and gaseous masses . with the present - day observational facilities , resolved line measurements",
    "could not yet be achieved for galaxies at redshifts higher than @xmath4 . in the redshift range @xmath5 , because of strong biases due to color pre - selections , only the brightest star - forming galaxies could be studied which is not the case in the redshift range @xmath0 , the 2.6 gyr - lasting epoch where the stark dichotomy within the galaxy population is rising and is set at @xmath6 and when star - forming galaxies representative of the bulk of galaxy population could be addressed .",
    "massiv ( massiv assembly survey with sinfoni in vvds ) is an eso large program which consists of 84 star - forming galaxies , in the redshift range @xmath0 , observed from 2008 to completion in 2011 , with the nir - ifu sinfoni on the vlt .",
    "spanning in a wide range of stellar masses log(m*)=[9,12 ] and selected from a well - defined , complete and representative parent sample based on accurate spectroscopic redshifts from the vimos vlt deep survey @xcite , the massiv sample is representative of the normal galaxy population . the j- or h",
    "- band has been used to target the redshifted @xmath7 bright emission line with a high spatial resolution ( @xmath8 ) , partly with adaptative optics .",
    "a full survey description and global properties of the galaxy sample is given in @xcite ( @xcite , paper i ) . the first epoch sample ( 50/84 galaxies )",
    "leads to several studies about kinematics and close environment classification ( @xcite , paper ii ) ; evidence for galaxies displaying positive metallicity gradients ( @xcite , paper iii ) ; fundamental relations ( @xcite , paper iv ) and major merger rate from close pairs ( @xcite , paper v ) .",
    "the total massiv sample of 84 galaxies allows resolved velocity measurements for 76 galaxies . for the kinematic classification",
    ", we used several criteria @xcite .",
    "one of them is based on the total velocity shear @xmath9 measured on the velocity field not inclination - corrected : 32/76 ( 42% ) galaxies have a high velocity shear ( @xmath10 ) and 44/76 ( 58% ) a low velocity shear ( @xmath11 ) . another criterion is to distinguish rotators from non - rotating galaxies using a classification based on the disagreement between morphological and kinematic position angles and the mean weighted velocity field residuals normalized by the velocity shear : again 32/76 ( 42% ) galaxies are rotators while 44/76 ( 58% ) are not rotating objects .",
    "finally we consider the nearby environment to distinguish isolated from not isolated galaxies : 58/76 ( 76% ) galaxies are isolated while 18/76 ( 24% ) are not .",
    "the galaxies presenting large @xmath9 are mainly rotating disks but also interacting / merging systems .",
    "galaxies showing low @xmath9 may be face - on disks , star - forming spheroids or on - going mergers in transient state .",
    "for rotating disks , depending on the total mass of the galaxies , typical maximum rotation velocities @xmath12 range between @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "considering these typical maximum rotation velocities @xmath15 , if all the disks were pure rotators in planes randomly distributed in the sky , the number of low @xmath9 disks should not exceed @xmath16 galaxies @xmath17 if all the galaxies were low mass galaxies ( for @xmath18 ) , @xmath19 galaxies @xmath20 for @xmath21 and @xmath22 galaxies ( @xmath23 ) if all the galaxies were high mass galaxies ( for @xmath24 ) .",
    "furthermore , even if the actual galaxy masses are overestimated , the high fraction of @xmath1 of low velocity shear is incompatible with the hypothesis of face - on rotators .",
    "finally , it has been shown in @xcite that _ ( 1 ) _ non - rotating galaxies are more compact in their extent of the stellar component than rotators but they are not statistically different in their gas extent ; _ ( 2 ) _ marginal evolution in the size - stellar mass and size - velocity relations are observed and _ ( 3 ) _ the large dispersion observed in the stellar and baryonic tully - fisher relations is reduced using the @xmath25 index instead of @xmath12 ( @xmath26 being the velocity dispersion ) .",
    "nevertheless , an intrinsic spread around the median trend remains even when using the @xmath27 index instead of @xmath12 and slowly rotating galaxies display lower @xmath27 index and stellar / baryonic masses than fast rotators .",
    "results on the metallicity gradients for the first epoch sample ( 50 galaxies ) have been published in @xcite while the second epoch sample ( 35 galaxies ) is still under analysis ( divoy et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . among the @xmath28 galaxies of the first epoch , both @xmath7 and @xmath29 $ ] lines",
    "have been measured for @xmath30 galaxies and metallicity gradients for @xmath31 .",
    "positive ( negative ) gradients refers to metallicity being higher ( lower ) in the center than in the outskirts .",
    "we have measured secure negative gradients for @xmath32 galaxies and positive ones for @xmath33 .",
    "preliminary results on the second epoch sample , which contains in average fainter and smaller galaxies than the first epoch one , indicate that integrated metallicities are measurable for @xmath34 galaxies .",
    "metallicity gradients have been measured for @xmath35 galaxies and forthcoming measurements will probably be possible for an extra couple of galaxies .",
    "among those 10 galaxies , @xmath36 of them display negative gradients and @xmath19 positive ones . on the whole massiv sample presently available , metallicity gradients have been measured on @xmath37 galaxies ; @xmath38 galaxies ( @xmath39 ) show secure classical negative gradients but @xmath40 galaxies ( @xmath41 ) show unexpected positive gradients , the other @xmath42 galaxies ( @xmath43 ) are compatible with a flat radial metallicity distribution .",
    "@xmath44 galaxies over @xmath38 ( @xmath45 ) showing a negative gradient are isolated ( @xmath46 or @xmath47 are in interaction ) while @xmath48 galaxies over @xmath40 ( @xmath49 ) that show a positive gradient are interacting ( @xmath50 or @xmath51 are isolated ) .",
    "interactions , mergers or cold gas accretion might be responsible for shallowing and even inverting the abundance gradient .",
    "the major merger rate at @xmath52 from ifu - based close pairs in massiv is studied in @xcite .",
    "a close pair is defined by a couple of galaxies showing _ ( 1 ) _ a projected separation lower than @xmath53 and _ ( 2 ) _ a radial velocity difference lower than @xmath54 .",
    "when the two galaxies overlap , the two components have been separated both using the morphology and the kinematics ( see left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "a major ( minor ) close pair is defined by a couple of galaxies for which the luminosity ratio is @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "@xmath57 is the number of major close pairs over a population of @xmath58 principal galaxies targeted .",
    "the fraction of major merger @xmath59 is basically equal to @xmath60 corrected for selection effects and covered area . within the stellar mass range @xmath61 , the massiv sample contains 20 close pair candidates , including @xmath62 major mergers and 7 minors mergers .",
    "the major merger rate @xmath63 at three different epochs , where @xmath64 is the merger time scale extracted from the millennium simulation , is given in table [ tab1 ] . using the massiv data combined with data extracted for the literature , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows that the fraction of major mergers evolves with the redshift @xmath65 like @xmath66 and the major merger rate like @xmath67 .",
    "the average number of major gas - rich mergers per star - forming galaxy between @xmath68 and @xmath69 is @xmath70 .",
    "half of the merger activity occurs at high redshift between @xmath68 and @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) and the other half more recently between @xmath73 and @xmath69 ( @xmath74 ) which means the average merger activity was higher by a factor @xmath75 at the earliest epoch than at the later one . accordingly to early type galaxies ( etgs ) classification based on fast and slow rotators from @xcite and using the following assumptions : _ ( 1 ) _ wet major mergers produce fast rotators ; _ ( 2 ) _ dry major mergers produce slow rotators , _ ( 3 ) _ dry minor mergers do not change the kinematical state of etgs and _ ( 4 ) _ all etgs at z=1.3 are fast rotators , a fraction of slow rotator of @xmath76 is computed and lead to the conclusion that merging is a major process driving mass assembly into the red sequence galaxies .",
