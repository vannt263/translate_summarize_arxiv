    "in this century , physicists have been departed from 19th century physics , in two ways .",
    "the first was the generalization and bringing the old idea of _ frame independence _ or _ general covariance _",
    ", in a manifest form .",
    "the result of this effort was the pioneer general relativity theory , in which the gravitational effects of matter are identified with the geometry of the space  time .",
    "the enigmatic character of this theory is just the above - mentioned property , i.e. the interconnection of gravity and general covariance .",
    "when one tries to make a general covariant theory , one is forced to include gravity .",
    "the main root of this interconnection is the _ equivalence principle_. according to the equivalance principle , it is possible to go to a frame in which gravity is locally absent , and thus the special theory of relativity is applicable locally . now using the general covariance and writing down anything in a general frame",
    ", we will get the general relativity theory@xcite .",
    "the second was the investigation of the quantal behavior of matter , that leads to the _ quantum theory _ , according to which a great revolution appeared in physics . in order to explain the atomic world , the quantum theory threw out two essensial classical concepts , the _ principle of causality _ and _ the dogma of formulation of physics in terms of motion in space  time _",
    "( motion dogma ) .",
    "the first one is violated during a measurement process , while the second does not exist at any time .",
    "after the appearance of quantum mechanics , it was proven that not only do the ordinary particles show quantal behavior but mediators of the fundamental forces also do so . in this way",
    "quantum electrodynamics , quantum chromodynamics and quantum flavor dynamics were born .",
    "but the construction of quantum gravitodynamics or quantum gravity , and its application to cosmology , is considerably very problematic@xcite .",
    "these difficulties may be mainly divided into two categories .",
    "some of them are related to the conceptual problems of the standard quantum mechanics , while others are specific to gravity , and are in fact related to the classical features of gravity theory .",
    "the first category includes the measurement problem and the meaning of the wave function of the universe , while the vanishing of the hamiltonian which leads to the time independence of the wave function and nonrenormalizability , belong to the second category .    from a fundamental physical viewpoint ,",
    "in contrast to the general theory of relativity which is the best theory for gravity , standard quantum mechanics is not the only satisfactory way of understanding the quantal behavior of matter .",
    "one of the best theories explaining the quantal behavior of matter but remaining faithful to the principle of causality and the motion dogma , is the de broglie ",
    "bohm quantum theory.@xcite according to this theory , all the enigmatic quantal behavior of the matter results from a self - interaction of the particle .",
    "in fact , any particle which exerts a _ quantum force _ on itself can be expressed in terms of a _ quantum potential _ and which is derived from the particle wave function .",
    "the celebrated property of the de broglie  bohm quantum theory is the following property .",
    "_ at anytime , even when a measurement is done , the particle is on the trajectory given by newton s law of motion , including the quantum force_. during a measurement , the system is in fact a many - body system ( including the particle itself , the probe particle , and the registrating system particles ) .",
    "when one writes down the appropriate equation of motion of all the particles , and when one considers the very fact that we know nothing about the initial conditions of the registerating system particles , one sees how the projection postulate of quantum mechanics came about@xcite . accordingly",
    "the result of any measurement is one of the eigenvalues of the operator related to the measured quantity with some calculable probability distribution .",
    "the de - broglie ",
    "bohm quantum theory of motion , is a causal theory which although behaves as the copenhagen quantum mechanics at the statistical level , it has non of the conceptual difficulties of the standard quantum mechanics .",
    "it is well proved that the causal theory reproduces all the results of the orthodox quantum theory@xcite , as well as predicting some new results ( such as time of tunneling through a barrier@xcite ) which in principle lets the experiment to choose between the orthodox and the causal quantum theories .",
    "perhaps the most important point about the causal theory is that it presents a causal deterministic description of the reality .",
    "so it looks very natural to make a quantum theory of gravity in the spirit of the de - broglie ",
    "bohm quantum theory of motion . in the standard form of this theory",
    ", the classical gravity should be viewed as a field",
    ". then it is possible to construct bohmian metric trajectories .",
    "this is what is essentially done in @xcite .",
    "a way of struggling with quantum gravity is to use the _ minisuperspace _ of the conformal degree of freedom of the space - time metric@xcite .",
    "this approach has several fruitfull results .",
    "it admits non - perturbative calculations , and it is very useful for studying quantum cosmology . because the isotropic and homogeneous space - time used in cosmology is conformally flat .",
    "in addition , by including the effects of the back  reactions of the quantum variable ( i.e. the conformal factor ) on the background metric , one arrives at some extended form of einstein s equations .",
    "these semi - classical equations lead to non  singular cosmological solutions and they have the correct classical limit . in this approach , by merely quantizing one degree of freedom of the space - time metric , and by considering the back  reaction effects , the time independence problem is solved .",
    "this is achieved because of the extension of einstein s equations .",
    "but it must be noted that the physical meaning of the quantum variable , i.e. the conformal factor , is not clear in this approach .",
    "the non - singularity of the results of the above approach rests on the theorem@xcite which states that _ for any singular metric , there is some appropriate conformal factor , in such a way that conformal metric is non - singular_.    the present work tries to combine the de - broglie ",
    "bohm quantum theory of motion and gravity in a very different way .",
    "the foundation of this approach is the de - broglie remark@xcite that _ the quantum theory of motion for relativistic spinless particles is very similar to the classical theory of motion in a conformally flat space - time_. the conformal factor is related to the bohm s quantum potential .",
    "we shall present a generalization and an appropriate formulation of this remark .",
    "that is to say , we geometrize bohmian mechanics according to the de - broglie remark .",
    "then , it can be seen that the effects of gravity on geometry and the quantum effects on the geometry of the space - time are highly coupled .",
    "in fact there are two contributions to the background metric the gravitational quantal effects of matter which constitute the energy ",
    "momentum tensor .",
    "since in the evaluation of the quantal part the background metric is used , the gravitational and quantal contributions to the background metric are so highly coupled that no one without the other has any physical significance .",
    "it must be pointed out here that as aresult the conformal factor is meaningless as the enesemble density goes to zero and the geometry looses its meaning at this limit .",
    "this is a desired property , because it is in accord with mach s principle , which states that for an empty universe the space ",
    "time should be meaningless .",
    "in subsection([s1])@xcite the authors , as a first step towards the formulation of the above conclusion , introduced the quantum conformal degree of freedom via the method of lagrange multipliers . in this way",
    "there are a set of equations of motion describing the background metric , the conformal degree of freedom and the particle trajectory .",
    "a corollary of this theory is that one can always work in a gauge ( classic gauge ) in which no quantum effect be present or in a gauge ( quantum gauge ) in which the conformal degree of freedom of the space ",
    "time metric is identified with the quantum effect this , in its turn , leads to dramatic departures from the classical prediction , when both the effects of gravity and quantum on geometry are considerable , i.e. around those areas of the space - time which are singular according to the classical theory .    as a different approach in ref @xcite the authors symmetrized the brans  dicke theory by a conformal transformation . and arrive to a particle interpretation suggesting that the quantum aspect of matter can be geometrized .    in @xcite",
    ", the conformal transformation was applied only to the space ",
    "time metric .",
    "other quantities like mass , density and so on were assumed to posses no transformation .",
    "this is because the above conformal transformation which incorporates the quantum effects of matter into a specific conformal factor , is in fact a scale transformation .",
    "as the conformal transformation is more general than scale transformation which is used in @xcite , it seems preferable to make a conformal transformation , in which all physical quantities are transformed , instead of making only a scale transformation . in reference @xcite",
    ", it is shown that by the conformal transformation the equation of motion would be transformed to an equation in which there is no quantum effects . as a result",
    ", the geodesic equation would be changed to the one without the quantum force .",
    "this means that it is possible to have two identical pictures for investigating the quantal effects of matter in the curved space ",
    "time background . according to the first picture ,",
    "the space ",
    "time metric contains only the gravitational effects of matter .",
    "the quantum effects affect the path of the particles via the quantum force . in the second picture ,",
    "the space ",
    "time metric is related to the previous by a conformal factor and contains the gravitational and quantal effects of matter .",
    "this shows that the quantum as well as the gravitational effects of matter have geometrical nature .",
    "the second picture mentioned above provides a unified geometrical framework for understanding the gravitational and quantum forces .",
    "accordingly , we call the conformal metric as the physical metric ( containing both gravity and quantum ) and the other metric is the background metric ( including only gravity ) .    the above - mentioned theory,@xcite has a problem .",
    "in this theory , it is assumed that one deals with an ensemble of similar particles with density . in bohm s",
    "theory , the quantum potential exists for a single particle as well as for an ensemble . in the case of a single particle ,",
    "the interpretation of the quantum potential is in terms of an hypothetical ensemble .",
    "note that in the above theories , the ensemble is a real one , not an hypothetical one , because , the energy  momentum tensor of the ensemble is appeared and has physical effects .",
    "as we shall show in subsection ( [ s2])@xcite , we have solved this problem and the theory would work both for a single particle and for an ensemble .    in subsection ( [ s2 ] ) we shall show that it is possible to make a pure tensor theory for quantum gravity . as a result",
    "we shall show that the correct quantum conformal degree of freedom would be achieved , and that the theory works for a particle as well as for a real ensemble of the particle under consideration and that it includes the pure quantum gravity effects .",
    "we shall do all of these by trying to write the quantum potential terms in terms of geometrical parameters , not in terms of ensemble properties .",
    "the important point about both references@xcite and @xcite is that in order to fix the relation of the conformal degree of freedom of the space ",
    "time metric and the quantum potential , the method of lagrange multiplier is used and in this way they are a little artificial . in subsection ( [ s3 ] ) we shall show@xcite that in the framework of the scalar ",
    "tensor theories , it is possible to write an action principle , in which both gravitational and quantum contributions to the geometry are included and that the conformal degree of freedom of the space  time metric is fixed at the level of the equations of motion not needing the method of lagrange multiplier .",
    "next in subsection ( [ s4])@xcite we attend to the double scalar case because in some theories such as superstring and kaluza  klein , it is more useful@xcite . in both of these theories the gravitational interaction",
    "includes two other fields in addition to the metric field . in string frame(or jordan frame)one of them",
    "is coupled nonminimally to gravity as in the brans  dicke theory and the other is coupled minimally to gravity , but has a nontrivial coupling with the first scalar field .",
    "note that , in these theories one can couple both the scalar fields minimally to gravity by a conformal transformation ( einstein frame ) . as a result",
    ", the question that the physical interpretation must be presented in which frame , is an open problem@xcite . on the other hand",
    "we shall show that using two scalar fields , one can relax this preassumption and on the equations of motion , the correct form of quantum potential will be achieved .    in subsections ( [ s5 ] ) , ( [ s6 ] ) and ( [ s7 ] )",
    "some general solutions are obtained . using these",
    ", the important question that if this quantum gravity theory leads to some new results , is investigated . that solusions are used for black holes and bigbang in subsections ( [ s8 ] ) and ( [ s9])@xcite . in subsection ( [ s10])@xcite we are interested in investigating whether this theory has anything to do with the cluster formation or clustering of the initial uniform distribution of matter in the universe .",
    "the problem of cluster formation is an important problem of cosmology and there are several ways to tackle with it@xcite .",
    "here we do nt want to discuss those theories , and our claim is not that the present work is a good one .",
    "here we only state that _ the cluster formation can also be understood in this way_. it is a further task to decide if this work is in complete agreement with experiment or not .",
    "a special aspect of the quantum force is that it is highly nonlocal .",
    "this property , is an experimental matter of fact @xcite . since the mass field represents the conformal degree of freedom of the physical metric , quantum gravity",
    "is expected to be highly nonlocal . in the subsection ( [ s11])@xcite this",
    "is shown explicitley for a specific problem .    from a different point of view",
    "it has been believed for a long time that the long range forces ( i.e. electromagnetism and gravity ) are different aspects of a unique phenomena .",
    "so they must be unified .",
    "usually it is proposed that one must generalize einstein s general relativity theory to have a geometrical description of electromagnetic fields .",
    "this means to change the properties of the manifold of general relativity . using higher dimensional manifolds@xcite , changing the compatibility relation between the metric and the affine connection@xcite and using a non - symmetric metric@xcite are some examples of the attempts towards this idea . in all the above approaches ,",
    "the additional degrees of freedom correspond to the components of the electromagnetic potential .",
    "the second idea leads to the weyl s gauge invariant geometry .",
    "apart from the electromagnetic aspects of weyl geometry , it has some other applications .",
    "some authors believe that weyl geometry is a suitable framework for quantum gravity .",
    "e.g. in a series of papers @xcite a succesful approach to weyl quantum gravity and conformal sector in quantum gravity is presented .",
    "the authors have used an effective theory based on integrated conformal anomaly dynamics , in the infrared region .",
    "they also have considered a sigma model action which is the most general version of a renormalizable theory in four dimmensions .",
    "they have investigated the phase structure and the infrared properties of conformal quantum gravity and then extend its results to higher derivative quantum gravity .",
    "also in ref@xcite a new quantum theory is proposed on the basis of weyl picture which is purely geometric .",
    "the observables are introduced as zero weyl weight quantities .",
    "moreover any weightful field has a weyl conjugate such as complex conjugate of the state vector in quantum mechanics . by these dual fields",
    ", the probability can be defined .",
    "these are the elements of a consistent quantum theory which is equivalent to the standard quantum mechanics .",
    "moreover it is shown that the quantum measurement and the related uncertainty would emerged from weyl geometry naturally . in this theory",
    "when the curl of weyl vector is zero , we arrive at the classical limit . by noting the transformation relation of weyl vector , it is concluded that the change of length scale is only a quantum effect",
    ".    one more approach to geometrize quantum mechanics can be found in @xcite . here a modified weyl ",
    "dirac theory is used to join the particle aspects of matter and weyl symmetry breaking . this is also a geometrization of quantum mechanics .",
    "also one can find the relation of quantum potential , the basic character of bohm s theory , to the fundamental geometric properties , especially to the curvature of the space - time using weyl geometry in @xcite .",
    "furthermore in @xcite sidharth considers the geometrical interpretation of quantum mechanics from the point of view of non - commutative non - integrable geometry .    in the present work we shall look at the conformal invariance at the quantum level .",
    "does the quantum theory lead us to any characteristic length scale and thus break the conformal symmetry ? or conversely the quantum effects lead us to a conformal invariant geometry ? in section ( [ s12 ] ) we shall discuss these questions in the context of the causal quantum theory proposed by bohm@xcite and use our new way of geometrization of quantum mechanics introduced in here .",
    "we emphasize that what we shall show that our specific geomerization of quantum mechanics procedure ( based on bohmian quantum mechanics ) can be better understood in the weyl framework .",
    "this is different from weyl quantum gravity approaches like those of @xcite .",
    "we shall show that the weyl vector and the quantum effects of matter are connected .",
    "we shall see how the conformal symmetry emerges naturally by considering quantum effects of matter .",
    "finally in section ( [ s13 ] ) we show that the weyl ",
    "dirac theory is a suitable framwork for identification of the conformal degree of freedom of the space  time with the bohm s quantum mass .    from a similar perspective , quiros and et all@xcite",
    "discuss the space ",
    "time singularity by the geometrical dual representation in general relativity . on this basis",
    "they emphasis on the weyl integrable geometry as a consistent framework to describe the gravitational field .",
    "finally in section ( [ s20 ] ) we shall investigate possible extension of our results in two ways . first analyzing the case of many  particle systems and second , inclusion of spin .",
    "the de - broglie  bohm quantum theory of motion@xcite is a causal theory which although agrees with the copenhagen quantum mechanics at the statistical level , it is able to determine the exact path of a particle . in this way",
    "it predicts all the physical quantities of a particle , _",
    "deterministically_. this theory does not contain such difficulties as the reduction of the wave function , and so on @xcite .",
    "therefore , it seems more appropriate that in building a quantum theory in the presense of gravity , to use the de - broglie ",
    "bohm theory rather than the copenhagen quantum mechanics . because in this case some of the conceptual problems of the standard quantum mechanics appear more clearly@xcite .",
    "now , we make a glance at the de - broglie ",
    "bohm quantum theory of motion .",
    "it contains three postulates@xcite .",
    "the first one states that for any particle , there is an _ objectively real _",
    "field @xmath0 which in the non - relativistic domain satisfies the schrdinger equation .",
    "the second postulate presents the effect of the field on the particle . according to this",
    "postulate the linear momentum of the particle is given by the so  called _ guidance formula _ : @xmath1 one can show that the particle expriences the force @xmath2 from the field @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the _ quantum potential _ given by : @xmath5 finally the third postulate states that at the statistical level we have : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the ensemble density of particles .",
    "a simple way to prove ( [ aa ] ) , is to make the canonical transformation @xmath8 in the action for the schrdinger equation .",
    "the equations of motion of @xmath7 and @xmath9 would be : @xmath10 @xmath11 in which @xmath12 is the classical potential and @xmath9 is the hamilton",
    " jacobi function . equation ( [ bb ] ) is the continuity equation provided ( [ cc ] ) is satisfied . under this condition",
    "the quantum hamilton - jacobi equation ( [ dd ] ) is identical to ( [ aa ] ) .",
    "extension of de - broglie  bohm causal theory of quantum phenomena to the relativistic case is a problematic matter .",
    "essentially all the problems of the copenhagen relativistic quantum mechanics can in principle be present in the de - broglie ",
    "bohm theory .",
    "there are at least three problems with copenhagen relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "they are :    * the problem of negative energy and space  like current densities for integer spins . * the problem of defining probability distribution for many  particle systems . * the conflict between measurement principle ( which states that measurement is instantaneous ) and the poincar transformations .",
    "we shall discus about the second problem at the end of this paper .",
    "the third one is essentially not a problem in de - broglie ",
    "bohm theory , provided the second problem is solved .",
    "this is because of the fact that measurement is not an instantaneous phenomena in this theory , it is a many  particle situation .    in a recent paper@xcite",
    "we have shown that the first problem is not present in de - broglie ",
    "bohm theory , provided one sets the natural constraint that the theory should lead the correct non  relativistic limit .",
    "let us make this point clear .",
    "usually one gets a de - broglie ",
    "bohm version of a copenhagen theory by writing the wave function in its polar form @xmath13 and decomposing the real and imaginary parts of the wave equation . doing this with the klein ",
    "gordon equation leads to a quantum hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation : @xmath14 with the quantum potential defined as : @xmath15 and the continuity equation : @xmath16 the above hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation ( [ ee ] ) shows that in the relativistic case the quantum potential is essentially the mass square .",
    "so one can define the quantum mass of a particle as : @xmath17 since the quantum potential can be a negative number , in general the tachyonic solutions would emerge .",
    "this is essentially related to the first problem noted above .",
    "although it can be shown that a non  tachyonic initial condition leads to a global ( in time ) non  tachyonic solution@xcite , but the existance of tachyonic solutions is a fatal problem .    it can be shown that the problem is that equation ( [ ee ] ) is not the correct relativistic equation of motion@xcite . a correct relativistic quantum equation of motion _",
    "should not only be poincar invariant but also has the correct non",
    " relativistic limit_. in @xcite we have shown that using these requirements one gets the correct equation of motion as : @xmath18 with @xmath19 this clearly is free from the above mentioned problem .",
    "the extension to the case of a particle moving in a curved background is not very difficult@xcite .",
    "this can be done through the same way as writing any special relativistic relation in a general relativistic form .",
    "one should only change the ordinary differentiating @xmath20 with the covariant derivative @xmath21 and change the lorentz metric @xmath22 to the curved metric @xmath23 .",
    "therefore the equations of motion for a particle ( of spin zero ) in a curved background are : @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 @xmath27    de - broglie made the following interesting and fruitfull observation@xcite : the quantum hamilton - jacobi equation ( [ a ] ) can be written as : @xmath28 from this relation it can be concluded that the quantum effects are identical with the change of the space - time metric from @xmath29 to : @xmath30 which is a conformal transformation",
    ".    therefore equation ( [ b ] ) can be written as : @xmath31 where @xmath32 represents the covariant differentiation with respect to the metric @xmath33 . in this new curved space - time",
    "the other equation of motion , i.e. the continuity relation should be written as : @xmath34    the important conclusion we draw from this argumentation is that _ the presence of the quantum potential is equivalent to a curved space - time with its metric being given by ( [ c])_. so in fact , we have the geometrization of the quantum aspects of matter . in this way",
    ", it seems that there is a dual aspect to the role of geometry in physics .",
    "the space - time geometry sometimes looks like what we call gravity and sometimes looks like what we understand as quantal behaviours .",
    "since the equations governing the space - time geometry are highly non - linear , the curvature due to the quantum potential may have a large influence on the classical contribution to the curvature of the space - time .",
    "this would be investigated in the following sections .",
    "the particle trajectory can be derived from the guidance relation and by differentiating ( [ a ] ) leading to newton s equation of motion : @xmath35 using the above conformal transformation , eq.([m ] ) reduces to the standard geodesic equation via the above conformal transformation .",
    "a general relativistic system consisting of gravity and classical matter ( relativistic particles without quantum effects ) is determined by the action : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and hereafter we chose the units in which @xmath38 .    on the other hand as it was seen in the previous section , the de - broglie remark leads to the conclusion that introducing the quantum potential , is equivalent to the introduction of a conformal factor @xmath39 in the metric .",
    "so in order to introduce the rather than quantum effects of matter into the action ( [ ff ] ) , we make the aforementioned conformal transformation , instead of adding the quantum potential term .",
    "accordingly , we write our action with quantum effects as : @xmath40=\\frac{1}{2\\kappa}\\int d^4x\\sqrt{-\\overline{g}}\\left ( \\overline{{\\cal r}}\\omega^2 - 6\\overline{\\nabla}_{\\mu}\\omega\\overline{\\nabla}^{\\mu}\\omega\\right ) \\ ] ] @xmath41\\ ] ] where a bar over any quantity means that it corresponds to no  quantum regime . here",
    "we used only the first two terms of expansion of equation ( [ d ] ) to kip things simple .",
    "no physical change emerges considering all terms . in the above action , @xmath42 is a lagrange multiplier which is introduced to identify the conformal factor with its bohmian value .    here",
    "two problems must be noted .",
    "first , in the above action , we use @xmath43 to raise or lower indices and to evaluate the covariant derivatives .",
    "second , the physical metric ( i.e. the metric containing the quantum effects of matter ) is @xmath29 given by @xmath44 .    by the variation of the above action with respect to @xmath43 , @xmath45 , @xmath7 , @xmath9 and @xmath42 we arrive at the following relations as our quantum equations of motion :    1 .",

    ". it may be noted that by combining ( [ gg ] ) and ( [ hh ] ) it is possible to arrive at a more simple relation instead of ( [ gg ] ) .",

    "this is what we expect from de - broglie s conjecture .      in the previous subsection",
    "we have assumed that there is a real ensemble of the quantum particle .",
    "now the question is what happens for the case of a single particle ? to investigate this , we first examine how we can translate the quantum potential in a complete geometrical manner , i.e.  we write it in a form that there is no explicit reference to matter parameters . only after using the field equations",
    "can one deduce the original form of the quantum potential .",
    "this has the advantage of allowing our theory to work both for a single particle and an ensemble .",
    "next , we write a special field equation as a toy theory and extract some of its consequences .",
    "let us first ignore gravity and examine the geometrical properties of the conformal factor given  by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the trace of the energy ",
    "momentum tensor and is substituted for @xmath7 ( as it is true for dust ) .    evaluating the einstein s tensor for the above metric",
    ", we have : @xmath68 so as an ansatz , we suppose that in the presense of gravitational effects , the field equation have some form like : @xmath69 this equation is written in such a way that in the limit @xmath70 the solution ( [ jj ] ) achieved .    making the trace of the above equation one gets @xmath71 which has the iterative solution : @xmath72 leading to @xmath73 up to first order in @xmath74 .",
    "now we are ready to make a toy model .      from the above equation",
    "we learn that @xmath67 can be replaced with @xmath75 in the expression for the quantum potential or for the conformal factor of the space ",
    "time metric .",
    "this replacement is in fact an important improvement , because the explicit reference to ensemble density is removed .",
    "this allows the theory to work for both a single particle and an ensemble .",

    "the same is true for the conformal factor .",
    "the conformal factor of the metric is a function of the quantum potential and the mass of a relativistic particle is a field produced by quantum corrections to the classical mass .",
    "we have shown that the presence of the quantum potential is equivalent to a conformal mapping of the metric .",

    "this argument motivates us to state that _ different conformal frames are identical pictures of the gravitational and quantum phenomena_. considering the quantum force , the conformally related frames are nt distinguishable .",

    "we feel different quantum forces in different conformal frames .",
    "this is similar to general relativity in which general coordinate transformation changes the gravitational force at any arbitrary point . here",
    "it may be appropriate to state a basic question .",
    "does applying the above correspondence , between quantum and gravitational forces , and between the conformal and general coordinate transformations , means that the geometrization of quantum effects implies conformal invariance just as gravitational effects imply the general coordinate invariance ?    to discuss this question , we recall what has been considered earlier in the development of general relativity .",
    "the general covariance principle leads to the identification of gravitational effects of matter with the geometry of the space  time . in general relativity",
    "the important fact which supports this identification is the equivalence principle . according to it",
    ", one can always remove the gravitational field at some point by a suitable coordinate transformation .",
    "similarly , as we pointed out previously , according to our new approach to bohmian quantum gravity , at any point ( or even globally ) the quantum effects of matter can be removed by a suitable conformal transformation .",
    "thus in that point(s ) matter behaves classically . in this way we can introduce a new equivalence principle calling it the _ conformal equivalence principle _",
    ", similar to the standard equivalence principle .",
    "the latter interconnects gravity and general covariance while the former has the same role about quantum and conformal covariance .",
    "both these principles state that there is no preferred frame , either coordinate or conformal . since weyl geometry welcomes conformal invariance and since it has additional degrees of freedom which can be identified with quantum effects , it provides a unified geometric framework for understanding the gravitational and quantum forces . in this way",
    "a pure geometric interpretation of quantum behavior can be built .",
    "due to these results , we believe that the de - broglie ",
    "bohm theory must receive increasing attention in quantum gravity .",
    "this theory has some important features .",
    "one of them is that the quantum effects appear independent of any preferred length scale ( opposed to the standard quantum mechanics in which the plank length is a characteristic length ) .",
    "this is one of the intrinsic properties of this theory which results from a special definition of the classical limit@xcite .",
    "another important aspect is that the quantum mass of the particle is a field .",
    "this is needed for having conformal invariance , since mass has a non  zero weyl weight . also , according to the geodesic equation ( [ m ] ) , the appearance of quantum mass justifies mach s principle@xcite which leads to the existence of interrelation between the global properties of the universe ( space  time structure , the large scale structure of the universe,@xmath234 ) and its local properties ( local curvature , motion in a local frame , etc . ) . in the present theory",
    ", it can be easily seen that the space  time geometry is determined by the distribution of matter . a local variation of matter field distribution changes the quantum potential acting on the geometry .",
    "thus the geometry is altered globally ( in conformity with mach s principle ) . in this sense our approach to the quantum gravity is highly non  local as it is forced by the nature of the quantum potential@xcite .",
    "what we call geometry is only the gravitational and quantum effects of matter . without matter",
    "the geometry would be meaningless .",
    "moreover in @xcite we have shown that it is necessary to assume an interaction term between the cosmological constant ( large scale structure ) and the quantum potential ( local phenomena ) .",
    "these properties all justify mach s principle .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the gravitational constant is in fact a field depending on the matter distribution through quantum potential .",
    "all these arguments based on bohmian quantum mechanics convince us that weyl geometry is a suitable framework for geometrization of quantum mechanics .",
    "a straightforward generalization of the einstein ",
    "hilbert action to weyl geometry leads to a higher order theory@xcite .",
    "dirac@xcite introduced a new action , called weyl  dirac action , by including a new field which is in fact a gauge function .",
    "it helped him to avoid higher order actions since fixing the gauge function led to einstein ",
    "maxwell equations .",
    "the weyl  dirac action is given by@xcite : @xmath235 here @xmath236 is the curl of the weyl four  vector @xmath237 , @xmath238 is an arbitrary constant , and @xmath225 is a scalar field of weight @xmath239 .",
    "the `` @xmath240 '' represents covariant derivative under general coordinate and conformal transformations ( weyl covariant derivative ) defined as : @xmath241 where @xmath242 is the weyl weight of @xmath243 .",
    "the equations of motion will then be : @xmath244 @xmath245 @xmath246 @xmath247 where : @xmath248 and the energy ",
    "momentum tensor @xmath249 , the current density vector @xmath250 and the scalar @xmath3 are defined as : @xmath251 @xmath252 @xmath253 on the other hand the equations of motion of matter and the trace of energy - momentum tensor can be obtained from the invariance of the action under the coordinate and gauge transformations .",
    "one can write them as : @xmath254 @xmath255 the first relation is only a geometrical identity ( the bianchi identity ) , and the second shows the mutual dependence of the field equations .    it must be noted that in the weyl ",
    "dirac theory , the weyl vector does not couple to spinors , so @xmath237 can not be interpretad as the electromagnetic potential@xcite . here",
    "we use the weyl vector not as the electromagnetic field but only as part of the space  time geometry . the weyl  dirac formalism is adopted , and we shall see that the auxiliary field ( gauge function ) in dirac s action represents the quantum mass field .",
    "in addition both the gravitation fields ( @xmath23 and @xmath237 ) and the quantum mass field determine the space  time geometry .      in this section we shall construct a theory for bohmian quantum gravity which is conformally invariant in the framework of weyl geometry . to begin with , note that if our model should consider massive particles , the mass must be a field .",
    "this is because mass has non  zero weyl weight .",
    "this is in agreement with bohm s theory . as we argued previousely",
    "a general weyl invariant action is the weyl  dirac action , whose equations of motion are derived in the previous subsection . to simplify our model , we assume that the matter lagrangian does not depends on the weyl vector , so that @xmath256",
    ". the equations of motion are now : @xmath244 @xmath257 @xmath258 @xmath259 and",
    "the symmetry conditions are : @xmath260 @xmath261 it must be noted that from equation ( [ aww ] ) we have : @xmath262 so @xmath237 is not independent of @xmath225 .",
    "it is worthwhile to see whether or not this model has anything to do with the bohmian quantum theory .",
    "we want to introduce the quantum mass field .",
    "now we shall show that this field is proportional to the dirac field . in order to see this",
    ", two conditions should neccessary meet .",
    "firstly , the correct dependence of the dirac field on the trace of energy ",
    "momentum tensor and , secondly the correct appearance of the quantum force in the geodesic equation .",
    "now note that using equations ( [ aww]),([xx ] ) , and ( [ yy ] ) we have : @xmath263 this equation can be solved iteratively .",
    "let we rewrite it as : @xmath264 the first and the second order solutions of this equation are : @xmath265 @xmath266 to derive the geodesic equation we use the relation ( [ zz ] ) .",
    "assuming that matter consist of dust with the energy  momentum tensor ( [ aaa ] ) and",
    "multiplying equation ( [ zz ] ) by @xmath89 , we have : @xmath267 comparison of equations ( [ ccc ] ) and ( [ ddd ] ) with equations ( [ ee ] ) and ( [ m ] ) shows that we have the correct equations of motions of bohmian quantum theory , provided we identify : @xmath268 @xmath269 @xmath270 this shows that we have succesfully geometrized boh - mian quantum mechanics .",
    "the @xmath225 field is in fact the bohmian quantum mass field , and the quantum coupling constant @xmath74 which depends on @xmath271 is also a field .",
    "in fact it is highly related to geometrical properties of the space ",
    "time through the above relation .    since a gauge transformation can transform a general space ",
    "time dependent dirac field to a constant one , and vice - versa , it can be shown that quantum effects and the lenght scale of the space ",
    "time are closely related . to see this suppose we are in a gauge",
    "in which dirac field is a constant . by applying a gauge transformation",
    "one can change it to a general space ",
    "time dependent function .",
    "@xmath272 this gauge transformation is defined as : @xmath273 so , the gauge in which the quantum mass is constant ( and thus the quantum force is zero ) and the gauge in which the quantum mass is space  time dependent are related to each other via a scale change .",
    "in other words , @xmath237 in the two gauges differ by @xmath274 .",
    "since @xmath237 is a part of weyl geometry , and dirac field represents the quantum mass , one concludes that the quantum effects are geometrized .",
    "one can see this fact also by referring to the equation ( [ aww ] ) which shows that @xmath237 is not independent of @xmath225 , so the weyl vector is determined by quantum mass , and thus this geometrical aspect of the manifold is related to the quantum effects . in this way ,",
    "the physical meaning of auxiliary dirac field is clarified , as while as a suitable model for geometrization of quantum mechanics is introduced .",
    "most of physicists believe in a non  zero cosmological constant because of two important reasons .",
    "it helps us to make the theoretical results to agree with observations .",
    "morever some topics , like large scale structure of the universe , dark matter , inflation , can be explored using it . on the other hand from astronomical observations , especially gravitational lensing , cosmological",
    "constant should be very small .",
    "( @xmath275 ) the fact that the cosmological constant is small produces some difficulties .",
    "how explain theoretically this value of the cosmological constant ? ( this question also applies to the gravitation coupling constant . )",
    "morever the cosmological constant is a measure of vaccum energy density .",
    "this includes some contribution from scalar fields , bare cosmological constant , quantum effect , and so on . but observed cosmological constant is more smaller than ( 120 order of magnitude less than ) each one of the above contributions .",
    "this is the so  called cosmological constant puzzle ( see @xcite and its references ) . till now many mechanisms are presented to solve the problem .",
    "one way to solve the problem is to give dynamical characters to gravitational and cosmological constants in such a way that they decrease as the universe expands .",
    "some works are done in @xcite and @xcite . in the former",
    ", a mechanism is presented using the wdw equation , while the latter , focuses on the breaking the conformal invariance .",
    "two scales , cosmological and particle physics are introduced . and",
    "a dynamical conformal factor which relates them produces an effective time dependent cosmological constant .",
    "we also use the conformal invariance , but in the conformal invariant framework of the present paper .",
    "let s choose a spatially flat robertson ",

    "these constants have a small value at the current epoch as the observation suggests .",
    "it can be noticed that these time dependences are through the quantum mass field ( @xmath225 or @xmath120 ) . the quantum mass field changes with time as @xmath297 .",
    "in this section we shall look for the possibility of extending the theory in two lines . manipulating many ",
    "particle systems and inclusion of spin .      till now our disscusion was about geometrization of quantum effects of single particle systems .",
    "what happens when one deals with a system consisting of more than one particle ?",
    "first the quantum potential for many  particle systems in the non  relativistic case is given by@xcite : @xmath298 its generalization to the case of particles moving in an arbitrary space ",
    "time is clearly : @xmath299 a difficulty arrises here .",
    "this quantum potential is defined in the configuration space , i.e. it is a function of @xmath300 , @xmath301 , @xmath234 @xmath302 . simply putting the exponential of the quantum potential as the conformal factor of the space ",
    "time metric should not work because this makes the metric to live in the configuration space , a completely meaningless thing . to solve the problem we can generalize the idea in this way .",
    "_ different particles of the many  particle system does not experience the same geometry .",
    "the @xmath303th particle sees the metric : _",
    "@xmath304 _ where @xmath305 denotes the bohmian trajectories . _ in this way one can see that there is no problem in geometrization of quantum effects for many ",
    "particle systems .",
    "there are at least two approaches to include spin in de - broglie ",
    "bohm theory .",
    "first one can see the spin as the @xmath306 of the particle around itself .",
    "this approach can easily used here .",
    "only one needs to add the rotational degrees of freedom for the motion of the particle .",
    "this is surely straightforward .",
    "the other approach looks at the spin ( just like the copenhagen quantum mechanics ) as an internal degree of freedom .",
    "so the spin is coded in the wave function .",
    "there is also no difficulty in adopting this approach . to explain this , first note that using the wigner formulation of any spin wave equation@xcite , one has a dirac  like wave equation for any spin : @xmath307 where the dirac spinor of rank @xmath308 is completely symmetric in its spinor indices . for zero mass",
    "we also has the condition @xmath309 .",
    "the velocity field compatible with this wave equation is the dirac current field @xmath310 .",
    "now one must add the continuity equation which can be seen as an equation for defining the ensemble density @xmath7 , and define the quantum potential in terms of it as usual .",
    "so the space ",
    "time metric is @xmath311 .",
    "we have used an approach which is different from other existing ones , which try to combine the gravitational and quantal effects . by the investigation of the quantum effects of matter in the framework of bohmian mechanics",
    ", we have shown that the motion of a particle with quantum effects is equivalent to its motion in a curved space - time .",
    "we have investigated the coupling of purely gravitational effects and purely quantal effects of the particle , by considering a general background space - time metric .",
    "the use of the de - broglie  bohm quantum theory of motion , instead of the standard copenhagen quantum mechanics , has at least three advantages .",
    "first , that the inherent problems of the standard quantum mechanics are not present .",
    "second , that the conceptual problems of the standard quantum gravity like the meaning of the wave - function , are circled .",
    "finally , the equivalence of quantum effects of matter and a curved space - time , which is our most important result , is achieved through this point of view .",
    "this leads directly to the minisuperspace of conformal degree of freedom , in which , the conformal factor has now a clear physical meaning .",
    "other problems like , time- dependence which is necessary to understand the evolution of the universe , consideration of the back  reaction effects , and so on , are also handled in the present theory .",
    "an important property of this theory is that the conservation laws are the same as those of the classical theory .",
    "as it is shown , if one applies this theory to the case of quantum cosmology , it is possible to solve the equations of motion nonperturbatively ( i.e. exactly ) .",
    "one sees that there is no singularity at small times ( provided one assumes that the quantum coupling constant of radiation is negative ) .",
    "it is smeared out by the quantum effects .",
    "two remarks are in order here .",
    "first , in principle , the above model can be applied to the non flat friedmann universes and similar results would emerge .",
    "second , in the present theory , the quantum effects are only those of matter . the effect of these quantal behaviours on the background space - time is achieved via the modified einstein equations , i.e. via the back  reaction effects .",
    "this means that if one removes the matter , the quantum effects of the background geometry would disappear . in order to generalize the present theory to a fully theory of quantum gravity , the quantum effects of gravity must be included .    as explained before the keystone of bohm s theory is the _",
    "quantum potential_. any particle is acted upon by a quantum force derived from the quantum potential .",
    "the quantum potential is itself resulted from some self - field of the particle , the wave function .",
    "since the quantum potential is related only to the norm of the wave function and because of born s postulate asserting that the ensemble density of the particle under consideration is given by the square of the norm of the wave function , the quantum potential is obtained resulted from the ensemble density . the non understandable point of bohm s theory is just this .",
    "how does a particle know about its hypothetical ensemble ?",
    "when the hypothetical ensemble is a real one , i.e.  when there are is large number of similar particles just like the particle under consideration , quantum potential can be understood .",
    "it is a kind of interaction between the particles in the real ensemble .",
    "but when one deals with only one particle the quantum potential is interaction with the other hypothetical particles ! ! !    on the other hand , quantum potential",
    "is highly related to the conformal degree of freedom of the space ",
    "time metric .",
    "in fact , the presence of the quantum force is just like having a curved space ",
    "time which is conformally flat and the conformal factor is expressed in terms of the quantum potential . in this way",
    "one sees that quantum effects are in fact geometric effects .",
    "geometrization of the quantum theory can be done successfully , but still , there is the problem of the ensemble noted above .",
    "here we have shown that if one tries to geometrize the quantum effects in a purely metric way , the ensemble problem would be overcome .",
    "in addition it provides the framework for bringing in the purely quantum gravity effects .    a point about the geodesic equation",
    "must be noted here . in the background metric , this equation resembles the geodesic equation in brans ",
    "dicke theory .",
    "consideration of the matter quantum effects , leads to the physical metric in which a particle moves on the geodesic of branse  dicke theory written in einstein gauge .",
    "this point supports the suggestion that the discussion of quantum gravity requires a scalar ",
    "tensor theory .",
    "previously this was suggested when discussing bohmian quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "next it is shown that it is possible to write a scalar ",
    "tensor theory which automatically leads to the correct equations of motion .",
    "this has the advantage that the conformal factor would be fixed by the equations of motion , and not by introducing a lagrangian multiplier by hand .",
    "we see that the matter distribution determines the local curvature of the space  time ( in confirmity with mach s principle ) .",
    "furthermore , from the matter equation of motion one can see that the cosmological constant ( a large scale structure constant ) and the quantum potential are coupled together .",
    "this is another manifestation of the mach s principle .",
    "also we have constructed a scalar ",
    "tensor theory with two scalar fields , for which the equations of motion lead to the correct form of quantum potential .",
    "we have not only shown that quantum effects are geometrical in nature , but also _ derive _ the form of quantum potential .",
    "this specific form for quantum potential is a result of the equations of motion .",
    "it must be noted that in this theory both the scalar fields interact with the cosmological constant .",
    "hence , the presence of the cosmological constant ( even very small ) is essential in order the theory works .",
    "note that the interaction between the cosmological constant and quantum potential represents a connection between the large and small scale structures .",
    "finally we saw that one can formulate a _ generalized equivalence principle _ which states that gravitation can be removed locally via an appropriate coordinate transformation , while quantum force can be removed either locally or globally via an appropriate scale transformation .",
    "so the natural framework of quantum and gravity is weyl geometry .",
    "the most simplest weyl invariant action functional is written out .",
    "it surprisingly leads to the correct bohm s equations of motion .",
    "when it applied to cosmology it leads to time decreasing cosmological and gravitational constants . a phenomena which is good for describing their small values .",
