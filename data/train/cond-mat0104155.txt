    "random graphs are entities one encounters in many fields of research . every time one has some objects or agents in mutual interaction , one can consider these objects or agents as the nodes ( vertices ) of a graph and represent pictorially the existence of the interaction by an abstract link ( edge ) connecting two nodes .",
    "hence , an epidemic can be regarded as a graph : the nodes are the infected people and the links connect those who have been infected with their infectors .",
    "likewise , the science citation index can be represented by a graph . of course , the world - wide - web is a graph .",
    "there are many more such examples .",
    "usually the graph structure is fairly random .",
    "consider a random graph .",
    "let @xmath0 denote the degree of a node and @xmath1 the corresponding bulk probability distribution .",
    "when @xmath2 for @xmath3 it is common to call the graphs _ scale - free_. this class of graphs is not described by the classical theory of random graphs @xcite , where @xmath1 is poissonian .",
    "the subject is not really new , but it became popular recently , when new data on large graphs - in particular on the web network structure @xcite - became available .",
    "scale - free graphs are naturally generated by stochastic processes , where the graph size is growing and the addition of links is preferential : the probability to attach a new link to a node is , roughly speaking , proportional to the node degree .",
    "several models of growing networks have been proposed @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the prototype is the model worked out in a classic paper by simon @xcite .",
    "this model does not really deal with graphs , but can easily be converted into a ( directed ) graph model , as observed in @xcite .    in studying random graphs one can adopt two complementary approaches :    - the _ diachronic _ approach , where one focuses on the time evolution of the graph .",
    "the main advantage of this approach is that one stays close , in spirit at least , to the dynamics operating in nature .",
    "furthermore , one can discuss processes , like aging , which are intimately related to the time evolution .",
    "to our knowledge this approach is the one commonly used in works on scale - free graphs .",
    "- the _ synchronic _ approach , where one considers the statistical ensemble of graphs at a fixed large time . introducing a statistical ensemble enables one to use the conceptual tools of statistical mechanics .",
    "the dynamics of processes producing scale - free networks is presumably much more complicated than that of the proposed simple models .",
    "the resulting randomness is better implemented in the synchronic than in the diachronic approach .",
    "generating graphs with an a priori given connectivity distribution seems also easier .",
    "this is the approach adopted in this work .",
    "0.6 in = 2.3 in 0.1 in    introducing a statistical ensemble of graphs means ipso facto that the graphs are weighted . in our model",
    "each graph is given a weight proportional to the product of weights attached to individual nodes and depending on node degrees .",
    "the latter weights are chosen so as to generate the scale - free behavior in the ensemble .",
    "thus , in a sense , the graphs - the microstates of the ensemble - are given an `` internal energy '' .",
    "our general results characterize , of course , the `` typical '' graphs only , ie those contributing most significantly to the ensemble averages .",
    "this can be considered as a virtue or as a flaw of the approach , depending on the goal one is pursuing .",
    "the `` typicality '' of graphs results from the usual interplay of energy and entropy ( see also fig .",
    "a rather general graph ensemble is defined in sec .",
    "ii . for definiteness",
    ", we consider undirected graphs only .",
    "we use techniques borrowed from field theory , which enable one to formulate the problem and to find a number of results in a rather elegant fashion .",
    "the ensemble is defined for a given set of input weights .",
    "we rapidly focus on scale - free _ connected tree _ graphs , ie connected graphs without cycles .",
    "this is the case we have fully under control and where many results can be obtained analytically , so that a maximum clarity is achieved and our approach is exposed the best .",
    "we discuss the condition that guarantees that an a priori given connectivity distribution is found in the `` output '' , ie when the weights of graphs and their entropy are taken into account . in sec .",
    "iii we show that the ensemble can be in a variety of phases . for each of these phases",
    "we calculate two important scaling exponents : the fractal and the spectral dimensions . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss what happens when the input weights are modified .",
    "we show that the scale - free regime is unstable .",
    "generically , the ensemble develops two responses : either a scale is spontaneously generated or else a `` singular '' node appears , which is connected to almost all other nodes ( the `` one - takes - it - all '' scenario ) @xcite .",
    "a graph model can be used as an event generator in monte carlo studies of the statistical properties of graphs themselves or of the `` matter '' ( eg ising spins , complex spins , etc ) living on the nodes @xcite .",
    "our discussion will also lead to the formulation of a simple computer algorithm for generating random graphs .",
    "readers more interested in this aspect of this work than in the more formal discussion to follow can jump directly to sec .",
    "v , where our algorithm is formulated , after reading the beginning of sec .",
    "ii to get acquainted with our notation . in sec .",
    "vi we present a sample of curves representing the connectivity distributions calculated for finite systems using our code , compared to the analogous curves generated from the growing network recipe of refs .",
    "@xcite and we briefly discuss some finite size effects .    in sec .",
    "vii we summarize our results and we discuss the problems related to the generalization of the present approach to models more complicated than the connected tree model discussed at length in the previous sections .",
    "we also list some open questions . in this paper , when necessary , we make use of some results , found in a different context , scattered in earlier publications we have co - authored @xcite .",
    "we believe , that it is useful to adapt these results to the present context , putting them in a new perspective and making them accessible to a different community .",
    "our starting idea is to use a toy field theory in 0 dimensions - we call it a minifield theory - and to identify the feynman diagrams of this theory with the graphs of our ensemble . the weights attached to the graphs are the amplitudes calculated using the standard feynman rules , the model being , of course , formulated in such a manner that these weights are positive .",
    "let us define the minifield theory @xcite by the following formal integral @xmath4 }             \\label{start}\\ ] ] by assumption the real constants @xmath5 are non - negative .",
    "hence , strictly speaking , the integral does not exist .",
    "however , expanding the second term in the exponential and performing the integrations over @xmath6 one obtains an unambiguously defined series .",
    "the terms of this series can be represented , as usual in field theory , by feynman diagrams .",
    "the convergence of the series is , in general , uncertain and requires some consideration .",
    "when the series converges , its sum , also denoted by @xmath7 , can be regarded as the partition function of a graph ensemble .    0.6 in = 2.3 in 0.1 in    the content of the above paragraph",
    "will appear obvious to the practitioners of field theory , but may appear fortuitous to some readers working on networks , but not totally familiar with the former .",
    "we have no space to explain the point at length .",
    "hopefully , a simple example may be of some help .",
    "consider the following contribution to @xmath7 : @xmath8 ^ 4       \\label{ex1}\\ ] ] we need to calculate the eighth moment of a gaussian .",
    "we shall do it in a fancy way . for book - keeping purposes we distinguish by a label the four `` interaction terms '' that are being multiplied above : @xmath9 ^ 4 \\rightarrow        \\phi(1)^2 \\phi(2)^2 \\phi(3)^2 \\phi(4)^2\\ ] ] and we represent each label by a point in a plane .",
    "we observe that every moment of a gaussian is fully determined by its second moment , which in our case equals @xmath10 .",
    "we replace all binomials appearing in the integrand , @xmath11 and we join with a line the points representing the labels @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the latter results in a specific graph , a feynman diagram .",
    "the moment to be calculated is obtained by summing over all possible matchings of four pairs of labels .",
    "all the _ connected _ graphs corresponding to our example are shown in fig .",
    "one checks easily that to each of these diagrams correspond 16 distinct matchings of the same four pairs of labels .",
    "thus , the contribution to the rhs of ( [ ex1 ] ) of each of these feynman diagrams is @xmath14 ^ 4/4!$ ] .",
    "the full result is obtained by taking into account the disconnected diagrams too . in some diagrams",
    "a line connects a point to itself ( @xmath15 ) , these are the so - called `` tadpoles '' .",
    "we shall not list all these diagrams here .",
    "the point is that the feynman diagrams of the minifield theory are the graphs familiar to people working on networks , except that there is a specific weight attached to each such a graph .",
    "the graphs are not necessarily connected , except if one imposes an appropriate extra constraint , defining a graph sub - ensemble .",
    "we assume that @xmath16 , which plays the role of an external current , is strictly positive .",
    "hence , in our minifield theory there exist graphs with nodes that are `` external '' , ie of unit degree .",
    "the weight associated with a feynman diagram that is `` non - degenerate '' - ie does not have tadpoles and multiple connections between nodes - and whose nodes are labeled , is @xmath17             \\label{w}\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote the total number of nodes and links respectively .",
    "when tadpoles and/or multiple connections are present one has to multiply the rhs by the usual symmetry factors . in graph theory",
    "some authors accept the existence of degeneracies in the definition of what they mean by a graph . in most texts",
    "the degeneracies are excluded .",
    "the class of graph models we propose is fairly general , but not the most general .",
    "indeed , by construction the weight of a graph is given in ( [ w ] ) by a product of weights associated with individual nodes .",
    "a possible generalization will be proposed later on .    as is well known from field theory , @xmath20 generates the connected graphs .",
    "only tree graphs survive in the `` semi - classical '' limit @xmath21 . from here on we focus on the statistical ensemble of _ connected tree graphs_. we shall return to more general graphs in the last section .",
    "in this paper we are interested in models where the radius of convergence of the series in the exponent on the rhs of ( [ start ] ) is finite .",
    "it is not a loss of generality to set this radius to unity .",
    "it is evident from ( [ w ] ) that this can always be achieved by a multiplicative renormalization of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the partition function of connected tree graphs @xmath24 is given by the stationary value of the action at @xmath25 , @xmath26 being defined implicitly by the saddle - point equation @xmath27    where we have introduced a shorthand notation @xmath28 .",
    "one easily checks that @xmath29    hence @xmath26 generates tree graphs with one marked external node .",
    "( [ root ] ) with its nice graphical representation @xcite - see fig .",
    "3 - has a long history and is recurrently rediscovered in the literature .",
    "0.6 in = 2.3 in 0.1 in    it is easy to see that @xmath26 is singular . indeed , eq . ( [ root ] )",
    "can only be satisfied if @xmath22 is smaller than some critical value @xmath30 .",
    "equation ( [ root ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath31    and by definition @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the point in the interval @xmath34 $ ] where @xmath35 takes its minimal value .",
    "the critical behavior of the theory is found from the behavior of @xmath35 in the vicinity of @xmath36 .",
    "one observes that both the rhs of ( [ saddle ] ) and its second derivative are positive for @xmath37 .",
    "moreover , @xmath38 is finite ( because @xmath39 ) .",
    "the concavity property of @xmath35 implies that one has , in general , the choice between only three possibilities ( cf refs .",
    "@xcite )  :    \\(a ) @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "\\(b ) @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "\\(c ) @xmath42 and @xmath44 .",
    "these three cases will be discussed in detail later on .",
    "it is customary to introduce a susceptibility critical exponent @xmath45 controlling the most singular part of the second derivative of the partition function . since @xmath26 is the first derivative of the partition function , we write @xmath46    the exponent @xmath45 is finite in all cases of interest for us , as will be shown in the following sections , where it will be calculated .    a factor @xmath22",
    "is associated with every link of a tree graph and has the physical significance of the fugacity of links . since @xmath47",
    ", it can also be regarded as the fugacity of nodes .",
    "hence @xmath48    taking the inverse laplace transform one obtains for tree graphs the canonical partition function @xmath49    hence , the ensemble of random trees behaves like a standard statistical mechanical ensemble .",
    "in particular , the number of trees with @xmath18 nodes is exponentially bounded in @xmath18 and the canonical ensemble has an extensive entropy .",
    "we have not yet introduced the constraints associated with the absence of a scale .",
    "the quantity of experimental interest is @xmath1 , the bulk connectivity distribution .",
    "it is @xmath1 which should exhibit a power - like fall at large @xmath0 .",
    "the relevant question is how to choose the series of the bare couplings @xmath5 in order to get a given scale - free @xmath1 .",
    "the rest of this section is devoted to this problem . for tree graphs",
    "the solution can be found mapping the model of graphs on another one , known in the literature as the balls - in - boxes model @xcite .    in sec .",
    "2.7.7 of ref .",
    "@xcite a series solution of eq .",
    "( [ root ] ) is given : @xmath50    with @xmath51    and @xmath52 being positive integers satisfying the constraints @xmath53    eq .",
    "( [ root2 ] ) can be further rewritten as @xmath54    with @xmath55    the summation is now on all sets of @xmath18 positive integers .",
    "the rhs is the partition function of a system of @xmath56 balls distributed at random and with weights @xmath57 among @xmath18 boxes , empty boxes being forbidden .",
    "this model of weighted partitions is precisely the balls - in - boxes model@xcite .",
    "the effective box occupation distribution is @xmath58 . using the integral representation of the ( discrete ) @xmath59-function one easily finds an integral representation of @xmath60 , which can be used to calculate it by the saddle - point method in the limit @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "the effective box occupation distribution follows .",
    "of course , the tree graph model corresponds to @xmath63 .",
    "we shall not repeat this calculation here , referring the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for details and quoting the result for @xmath64 : @xmath65    up to an obvious normalization factor . here",
    "@xmath36 is to be found from @xmath41 .",
    "this last condition can be rewritten as @xmath66    the lhs is an increasing function of @xmath36 .",
    "consequently @xmath67 corresponds to @xmath68 and therefore to the case ( b ) introduced earlier .",
    "hence , for tree graphs and in the limit @xmath61 @xmath69    this result can be understood intuitively .",
    "the shape of the two distributions , @xmath1 and @xmath57 , differs because of the constraint @xmath70 .",
    "but for @xmath61 the constraint is satisfied `` for free '' when @xmath71 and @xmath72 by virtue of khintchin s law of large numbers .",
    "the condition ( [ cond ] ) solves our problem : the input couplings @xmath5 of the tree - graph model should be set to @xmath73 in order to get the scale - free connectivity distribution @xmath1 in the bulk . the distribution @xmath1 must , of course , satisfy the constraint @xmath74 , otherwise it would not refer to trees @xcite .",
    "in this section we discuss the geometry of graphs belonging to the statistical ensemble of scale - free trees . hence , according to the results of the preceding section , we assume that @xmath75 for @xmath76 and that @xmath77 .",
    "we have already stated in the preceding section that this situation corresponds to the case ( b ) : @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "it follows from general arguments that @xmath35 has a branch point at @xmath78 .",
    "the order of the singularity is determined by the shape of the tail of @xmath57 . for non - integer @xmath79",
    "one finds ( cf @xcite ) that@xcite @xmath80    the concavity of @xmath35 implies @xmath81 .",
    "the linear term in the polynomial is absent .    when @xmath82 , inverting eq .",
    "( [ ser ] ) one finds the singular part of @xmath26 : @xmath83    so that @xmath84 .    when @xmath85 the inversion yields @xmath86    therefore , @xmath87 .",
    "we now consider two scaling exponents which have a direct geometrical interpretation in terms of the average `` dimension '' of the ensemble graphs .",
    "one can define a two - point correlation function @xmath88 equal , up to normalization , to the average number of pairs of nodes separated by a distance @xmath89 . using a graphical representation analogous to that of fig . 3 one finds @xcite : @xmath90^x\\ ] ]",
    "the fractal dimension @xmath91 of the tree can be defined by @xmath92    where it is assumed that @xmath93 .",
    "notice , that @xmath94 is a measure of the average size of a graph@xcite .",
    "one finds finally @xmath95 [ nice ]    another definition of dimension is obtained by considering a diffusion process on the graph ; as is well known , diffusion can be mapped to a random walk .",
    "if we consider a walker departing from a certain point at time @xmath96 , then the return probability to the start of the walk is , for small @xmath97 , proportional to @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the spectral dimension : the dimension of the graph as seen by a random walker moving on the graph .    in was shown in @xcite that the spectral dimension @xmath99 is for @xmath100 given by @xmath101    combining ( 26 ) and ( [ ds ] ) one",
    "obtains the nice relation @xmath102    for @xmath85 one finds @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "these are the generic values for a tree graph @xcite , which would be found also if there were only a finite number of non - vanishing couplings @xmath57 .",
    "the typical graph is a fully developed tree , with many branching branches .    for @xmath82",
    "one obtains : @xmath105 @xmath106    as @xmath107 the trees become increasingly crumpled , they look like a set of linked hedgehogs . as @xmath79 approaches 2 the average distance between a pair of nodes starts growing very slowly with @xmath18 .",
    "e.g. when @xmath108 this distance is @xmath109 .",
    "the increase is not logarithmic , as is sometimes claimed , but power - like .",
    "of course , in practice this does not make much difference , when the power is small .",
    "the upshot of the above discussion is that a scale - free large - degree behavior @xmath2 , @xmath72 , is associated with a variety of distinct graph geometries .",
    "it is quite remarkable , that at least for the tree graphs of the discussed ensemble one can give a complete catalogue of expected geometries .",
    "the logical next step of the discussion is to examine what happens when the shape of @xmath57 is so distorted that the constraint @xmath110 is broken .",
    "we continue assuming that @xmath75 at large @xmath0 .",
    "consider first the case @xmath111 .",
    "this condition is equivalent to @xmath44 .",
    "we recover the case ( c ) of sec .",
    "ii . since the linear term in the polynomial on the rhs of ( [ ser ] ) is now present , inverting eq .",
    "( [ ser ] ) one gets @xmath112    with @xmath72 . an explicit calculation using ( [ c ] ) yields @xmath113 . we also expect @xmath114 .",
    "a typical tree graph looks like a set of linked hedgehogs .",
    "moreover , as explained below , a new feature shows up : a `` singular '' node with a fixed degree of @xmath115 , a hedgehog even more spiky than the others .    to see this ,",
    "it is instructive to understand how the constraint @xmath116 is satisfied .",
    "notice that if we omit from @xmath117 a few terms , say @xmath118 , the resulting sum will fluctuate around @xmath119 .",
    "hence , for @xmath61 @xmath120    but since @xmath116 , it is clear that some , at least , of the contributions to the sum on the lhs must be of order @xmath115 . since the probability distribution falls like a power , it is most probable that there is only one such contribution .",
    "thus , one expects the appearance of a characteristic `` singular '' node with degree @xmath121 .",
    "other nodes have degree distribution @xmath122 : @xmath123\\ ] ]    the normalization factor in front of @xmath59 is determined by the tree condition @xmath74 .",
    "the other possible case is @xmath124 .",
    "this condition is equivalent to @xmath125 , which by virtue of the concavity of @xmath35 implies that @xmath40 .",
    "this is the case ( a ) of sec .",
    "hence @xmath1 equals @xmath57 times an exponentially falling factor . a scale in the node order distribution",
    "is spontaneously generated .",
    "the dramatic fluctuations of node degrees are absent .",
    "expanding @xmath35 in the neighborhood of @xmath126 , where its derivative is bound to vanish and inverting the resulting expansion in order to find the most singular part of @xmath26 one gets @xmath127    hence @xmath128 and one again obtains the generic values @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the above two scenarios are the only alternatives to the scale - free behavior of the discussed statistical ensemble of tree graphs .",
    "one can show that the transitions between different phases of the model are continuous and that the degree of their softness varies when the couplings @xmath57 change .",
    "there is no phase transition between the generic phase ( a ) and the scale - free regime ( b ) with @xmath129 .",
    "in the synchronic approach the construction of graphs does not mimic any real physical process .",
    "the emphasis is on the flexibility and on the efficiency in producing a sample of graphs to work with .",
    "we use the following notation  : @xmath130 .",
    "we propose an algorithm working for a given fixed @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "it rewires links , generating feynman diagrams of the minifield theory , proceeding as follows@xcite :    ( a ) : :    pick a random oriented link @xmath131 .",
    "( b ) : :    pick a random target node @xmath132 .",
    "( c ) : :    apply the metropolis test : rewire the link @xmath131 to    @xmath133 with probability    @xmath134    when the rhs above is less than unity and with probability equal to unity otherwise .    these feynman diagrams are properly weighted .",
    "the algorithm is probing all possible connections within a set of distinguishable nodes . for non - degenerate diagrams the metropolis condition immediately follows from the detailed balance equations together with the weight ( [ w ] ) given to microstates . for",
    "general diagrams the symmetry factors , related to the presence of tadpoles and multiple connection between nodes , also come out correctly .",
    "this is again a consequence of the detailed balance  : if two nodes are connected by @xmath135 links , the transition to a state where the nodes are connected by @xmath136 links can be done in @xmath135 ways .",
    "the inverse operation has only one realization . when @xmath137 the metropolis test is always positive and the non - degenerate labeled diagrams produced by the algorithm are equiprobable , as they should be .",
    "we have checked the validity of the general argument on a variety of examples .    in order to produce connected tree graphs ,",
    "one starts from a connected tree configuration , eg a polyline with free ends and one adds , before the metropolis test , a check insuring that @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "it is easy to convince oneself that with this constraint the tree is never broken into parts . as explained in sec .",
    "ii , the scale - free connectivity distribution in the bulk is obtained setting @xmath140 .",
    "notice , that with a constraint added before the metropolis test , the algorithm explores a well defined sub - ensemble of graphs .",
    "however , because the detailed balance is satisfied , this sub - ensemble is in equilibrium , or , more precisely fluctuates around equilibrium ( see also the remark on that matter in the last section ) .",
    "thus , within the sub - ensemble in question the algorithm tends to sample `` typical '' graphs .    0.6 in = 2.3 in 0.1 in",
    "since we propose a new algorithm for generating random graphs , it may be of interest to the reader to see how our results compare to those obtained with an algorithm already existing on the market . as an example to compare with we take the growing network model of ref .",
    "@xcite , which is a slight generalization of the algorithm proposed originally in ref .",
    "@xcite and which also generates connected trees .",
    "the asymptotic analytic solution for @xmath1 is given by eq .",
    "( 12 ) in the second paper of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) : @xmath141    0.6 in = 2.3 in 0.1 in    we use this @xmath1 as input in our code . a sample result is shown in fig .",
    "4 , where we compare the results of the calculation using the two algorithms , respectively .",
    "the calculated points are practically indistinguishable and follow the input distribution , except for those @xmath0 where finite - size effects cut and distort the distribution .    indeed ,",
    "when @xmath18 is finite , the distribution of node degrees can not extend to infinity , there is an upper cut - off on @xmath142 .",
    "the cut - off can be estimated by imposing the condition that the expected number of nodes found above @xmath143 is at most equal to unity .",
    "then @xmath144    the value of the constant on the rhs depends on the detailed shape of @xmath1 .",
    "( [ tail ] ) leads to the scaling law @xmath145    analogous to the result of @xcite , where instead of @xmath18 appears the time . beyond @xmath146 the node distribution function",
    "falls very abruptly and can be neglected for all practical purposes .",
    "notice , that @xmath146 may be much smaller than @xmath18 . as noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite this explains why large scale - free graphs with @xmath79 significantly larger than 3 are not observed in nature .    in fig .",
    "5 we show the evolution of @xmath1 with @xmath18 . in order to obtain a very precise result we use , instead of the monte carlo , an analytic recursion formula satisfied by the equivalent partition function given by eq .",

    "5 is rescaled , for different @xmath18 and using ( [ cut ] ) , the curves corresponding to the same @xmath79 are cut at the same place .",
    "let us summarize what has been achieved so far : we have started by introducing a fairly general ensemble of random graphs , but we have rapidly focused our attention on the sub - ensemble of connected tree graphs .",
    "we have found the conditions insuring that the latter are scale - free .",
    "we have discussed in detail the geometry of the connected tree graphs .",
    "we have also constructed a computer algorithm generating these graphs with an arbitrary bulk connectivity distribution @xmath1 .",
    "since our analytic discussion may sound somewhat formal for some readers , let us illustrate it with a simple , but very instructive example .",
    "consider a two - parameter family of input weights @xmath28 : @xmath147 and @xmath148 . the condition insuring that the trees are scale - free was found in sec .",
    "ii and is @xmath149 . in the example in question",
    "it is equivalent to the following relation between the parameters @xmath150 and @xmath79 : @xmath151      as one moves along this line in the direction of decreasing @xmath79 , the geometry remains generic down to @xmath153 and becomes progressively more and more crumpled below that point . in particular , the fractal dimension increases from the initial value 2 to @xmath154 ( see eq .",
    "( [ add1 ] ) ) . this behavior is easily understood .",
    "when @xmath79 is moved towards 2 the convergence of the series deteriorates . the only way to keep the average @xmath119 constant , viz .",
    "equal to 2 , is to reduce the normalization of the tail .",
    "this means , however , that the relative weight of nodes with unit degree gets larger",
    ". eventually , the number of `` external '' nodes increases with @xmath18 much faster than the number of large degree nodes .",
    "the latter are usually connected to the former , building hedgehog - like structures .    off the line ( [ eqab ] )",
    "one falls into one of the alternative phases discussed in sec .",
    "iv : either a scale is generated spontaneously and @xmath1 falls exponentially , or else there appears a `` singular '' node with huge connectivity @xmath155 . in the former case",
    "the graphs have a typical extension @xmath156 while in the latter case they are crumpled and have infinite fractal dimension . because of the constant presence of the `` singular '' vertex the diameter of the graph grows slower than any power of @xmath18 for @xmath61 .",
    "notice , that the condition @xmath72 appears often in our discussion . indeed , at least in the framework adopted in this paper , a scale - free graph with a different exponent",
    "can not exist . actually , the arguments used towards the end of sec .",
    "iv can also be used when @xmath157 and one predicts an exponentially falling @xmath1 at the `` output '' .",
    "we have considered the stability of scale - free graphs with respect to possible deformations of the sequence of weights .",
    "indeed , in nature a random graph does not exist in isolation .",
    "it is an open system , subject to interactions with , loosely speaking , a heat bath .",
    "it is thus interesting to know what is expected to happen when this interaction becomes strong .",
    "our results reflect the behavior of `` typical '' graphs .",
    "but very `` atypical '' values of global parameters , for example of the spectral dimension , can be found when a specific large graph is analyzed @xcite .",
    "our algorithm makes it possible to measure the degree of this `` atypicality '' : a numerical simulation enables one to estimate the probability of a given fluctuation of the global parameter .",
    "our graph model has been constructed in such a way that the weight of a graph is a product of weights associated with individual nodes .",
    "a possible generalization could consist in replacing the starting graph generating function defined in ( [ start ] ) by @xmath158}\\ ] ] where @xmath159 is a positive definite matrix of rank @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "the series expansion of the rhs generates graphs with nodes of degree 1,2 , ... , q and a weight @xmath162 attached to every link connecting a pair of nodes of degree @xmath135 and @xmath0 .",
    "the limit @xmath163 should be handled with care . in a study of tree graphs",
    "the limit @xmath21 should be taken first .",
    "the investigation of this model goes , however , beyond the scope of the present paper @xcite .",
    "another generalization would consist in putting `` matter '' fields on graphs .",
    "ising spins on `` small - world '' graphs @xcite were already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . ising spins living on the nodes of quenched feynman diagrams generated by @xmath164 or @xmath165",
    "interactions were studied by many people ( see , for example , @xcite and the long list of references therein ) , in particular with the aim to determine the critical behavior of the spin system .",
    "it would be very interesting to extend these studies to scale - free graphs as defined in the present paper and to see , for example , what is the effect of changing @xmath79 and therefore also the fractal dimension of the graphs .",
    "the most important generalization consists in extending the study to graphs with cycles .",
    "introduction of a fixed number of cycles does not seem to be a big deal in the present context ( see , however , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for example , when @xmath61 the hausdorff dimension is expected to be insensitive to the presence of a fixed number of cycles . on the other hand , the case where the ratio @xmath166 is kept fixed at some arbitrary value when @xmath61 is very challenging .",
    "there are conceptual problems related to the over - extensive nature of the ensemble .",
    "it is not difficult to count the number of non - degenerate graphs with given @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "it is sufficient to consider the number of distinct adjacency matrices @xmath167 , for @xmath168 connected or not , respectively : @xmath169 in general the rhs behaves like @xmath170 when @xmath61 , @xmath166 fixed .",
    "a similar result is easily obtained for degenerate graphs .",
    "the entropy is not extensive .",
    "this is easy to understand .",
    "it is impossible to divide an arbitrary graph into two parts separated by a `` boundary '' of negligible measure .",
    "any two nodes can interact .",
    "hence , it is not certain , in general , that the bulk distribution @xmath1 calculated in the ensemble coincides with that obtained from a single , sufficiently large graph .",
    "tree graphs are a notable exception : in the `` semiclassical limit '' @xmath21 the entropy becomes extensive .",
    "our algorithm , in its most general version , generates all possible feynman diagrams and can in principle be used to simulate arbitrary graphs .",
    "the problem is to find the constrains on the couplings @xmath5 insuring that the bulk connectivity distribution has a desired form .",
    "the presence of the factor @xmath171 in ( [ metro ] ) means that the rewired nodes are sampled independently of their degree ( without this factor nodes belonging to a large number of links would be rewired preferentially ) .",
    "if no extra check is performed before the metropolis one , the algorithm does not know about the underlying graph structure .",
    "it plays with node degrees and nodes as it would play with balls and boxes in the balls - in - boxes model with occupation weights @xmath5 .",
    "hence a scale free @xmath1 is obtained setting @xmath172 ( and @xmath173 ) .",
    "the graphs produced that way are degenerate , there are tadpoles and multiple connections between nodes .",
    "they are , in general , not connected - it is very difficult to avoid producing disconnected graphs - but for @xmath174 most of nodes belong to the giant component .",
    "the conditions of its appearance are well understood @xcite .",
    "the connectivity distribution within the giant component has the same scale - free behavior at not too small @xmath0    our present experience is that the algorithm has no difficulty to equilibrate the ensemble .",
    "the algorithm defines a markov process .",
    "we do not have any proof that the next - to - largest eigenvalue of the transition matrix is separated from unity by a gap remaining finite when @xmath61 .",
    "but it seems very likely that it is so , since we do not expect any collective effects to occur .    a different algorithm , generating graphs with an arbitrary connectivity , is proposed and used in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this algorithm",
    "a graph is generated in two steps .",
    "first , a list of @xmath18 degrees , @xmath175 , is sampled out of the distribution @xmath1 . in a sense ,",
    "one creates first @xmath18 nodes with attached links having the other end free .",
    "then , in the second step , one connects together at random the free ends of links .",
    "the produced graph is , in general , not connected and degenerate .",
    "the ensemble is defined by repeating this procedure over and over . in the limit",
    "@xmath61 the connectivity distribution is identical to @xmath1 for _ individual graphs_. notice , that @xmath176 is not fixed .",
    "our approach , rooted in field theory , is different .",
    "we start with micro - states weighted so that the connectivity distribution becomes scale - free after _ averaging over the ensemble_. but , as already mentioned , the scale - free connectivity within individual graphs is , strictly speaking , not guaranteed , except for the ensemble of trees : averaging within a single graph of infinite size is , in general , not equivalent to averaging over the ensemble of graphs .",
    "this is perhaps a flaw , but on the whole the virtues of the two approaches seem complementary .",
    "we hope to develop this point elsewhere .    in order to construct non - degenerate graphs",
    "it suffices to verify , before performing the metropolis check , that the proposed rewiring does not produce tadpoles and/or multiple connections .",
    "we have a code doing that efficiently .",
    "the real problem , which we have not solved yet , is to find for non - degenerate graphs the set of couplings @xmath5 producing the desired scale - free bulk distribution @xmath1 . setting @xmath177",
    "gives for , say , @xmath153 results that are encouraging , although the cut - off @xmath146 is smaller than in the degenerate case .",
    "however , when @xmath79 is decreased things worsen .",
    "no doubt , the problem deserves more theoretical and numerical work .",
    "we are tempted to conjecture that the degeneracy does not matter for large scale features of graphs .",
    "the absence of any natural scale suggests that the graphs are self - similar .",
    "if so , one can decimate nodes as follows : pick a node at random and shrink to a single point all its immediate neighbors .",
    "if the graph is really self - similar , decimating nodes should not alter its large scale features .",
    "but such a decimation will necessarily produce degenerate graphs . for the moment",
    ", this conjecture is a speculation .",
    "however , our experience with simulating random surfaces suggests that this possibility should not be disregarded : degenerate randomly triangulated surfaces - those whose duals have `` tadpoles '' and `` self - energy '' insertions - turn out to fall into the same universality class as the non - degenerate surfaces , but are much easier to simulate .",
    "we are very grateful to olivier martin for a helpful conversation .",
    "we would also like to thank our friends and collaborators piotr bialas , des johnston , jerzy jurkiewicz and john wheater for countless discussions .",
