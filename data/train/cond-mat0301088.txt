    "although burnett determined the second - order pressure tensor for the boltzmann equation@xcite , he had not derived the explicit second - order velocity distribution function of the boltzmann equation.@xcite this is a result of mathematical difficulties , as was indicated by fort and cukrowski.@xcite therefore , none has succeeded to obtain the correct reaction rate of present s model except for fort and cukrowski who adopted information theory@xcite as the nonequilibrium velocity distribution function to second order.@xcite    recently , we have derived the explicit velocity distribution function of the steady - state boltzmann equation for hard - sphere molecules to second order.@xcite in this letter , we apply the explicit velocity distribution function to the calculation of the rate of chemical reaction in the line - of - centers model under steady heat conduction .",
    "in the early stage of a chemical reaction between monatomic molecules : @xmath0 the rate of chemical reaction is not affected by the existence of products.@xcite from the viewpoint of kinetic collision theory@xcite , the rate of chemical reaction ( [ cr10 ] ) can be described as @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the velocities of the molecules , @xmath4 their relative speed , @xmath5 the solid angle , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the distributions of @xmath2 and @xmath8 at @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "we adopt the line - of - centers model as the differential cross - section of chemical reaction @xmath10.@xcite the model contains @xmath11 with @xmath12 mass of the molecules and @xmath13 the threshold energy of the chemical reaction .",
    "@xmath14 is regarded as a distance between centers of monatomic molecules at contact.@xcite    in order to calculate the rate of chemical reaction ( [ cr20 ] ) , we expand the velocity distribution function @xmath15 to second order as @xmath16 around the local maxwellian , @xmath17 $ ] , with @xmath18 the density of molecules , @xmath19 the boltzmann constant and @xmath20 the temperature defined from the kinetic energy .",

    "we introduce the explicit form of the velocity distribution function of the steady - state boltzmann equation for hard - sphere molecules to second order in the density and the temperature gradient along @xmath34-axis@xcite : @xmath35 which is an odd function of @xmath27 , and @xmath36 with the scaled velocity @xmath37 . here",
    "@xmath38 represents the gamma function and @xmath39 is a sonine polynomial , the definition and the orthogonality properties of which are written in our paper.@xcite @xmath40 denotes the steady heat flux with @xmath41 .",

    "note that , though we have derived them in forms of fractions , we use them in forms of four significant figures , since the forms of the fractions are too complicated .",
    "we have derived each of @xmath26 and @xmath31 to @xmath45th approximation of sonine polynomials , though the complete forms of @xmath26 and @xmath31 for hard - sphere molecules are the sums of an infinite series of sonine polynomials .",
    "however , we have confirmed that @xmath31 does not converge to @xmath46th sonine approximation but both of @xmath26 and @xmath31 almost converge to @xmath45th sonine approximation@xcite , so that , in this letter , we will show the results calculated from @xmath26 and @xmath31 for @xmath45th approximation of sonine polynomials .",
    "we note that burnett had determined only @xmath42 and @xmath44 to @xmath46th sonine approximation : @xmath44 is related to the second - order pressure tensor.@xcite therefore , we could not calculate the effect of steady heat flux on the rate of chemical reaction with the line - of - centers model if we did not derive the explicit forms of @xmath26 and @xmath31 , especially @xmath43 in ref.@xcite .    in order to compare the results from the steady - state boltzmann equation with those from the steady - state bhatnagar - gross - krook(bgk ) equation and information theory",

    "inserting @xmath26 and @xmath31 of eqs.([cr100 ] ) and ( [ cr110 ] ) and the corresponding velocity distribution functions for the steady - state bgk equation and information theory into eqs.([cr80 ] ) and ( [ cr90 ] ) , and performing the integrations with the chemical reaction cross - section ( [ cr30 ] ) , we finally obtain the nonequilibrium effects on the rate of chemical reaction based on the line - of - centers model .",
    "the expressions of @xmath32 and @xmath33 become @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively . the numerical values for @xmath49 and @xmath50",
    "are listed in tables [ alpha ] and [ beta ] , respectively .",
    "we have found that @xmath33 for the steady - state boltzmann equation is determined only by the terms of @xmath43 in @xmath31 of eq.([cr110 ] ) which burnett@xcite had not derived : the terms of @xmath43 we have derived in ref.@xcite are indispensable for the calculation of @xmath33 .",
    "the explicit expressions in eqs.([cr120 ] ) and ( [ cr130 ] ) for information theory were already given by fort and cukrowski.@xcite though they were interested in forms of @xmath51 and @xmath52@xcite , in the present letter , we focus on the nonequilibrium effects on the rate of chemical reaction in the forms of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "this is because the forms of @xmath53 and @xmath54 for the steady - state boltzmann equation do not converge even when we adopt any higher order approximation of sonine polynomials .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath55 in eqs.([cr120 ] ) and ( [ cr130 ] ) is directly related to the order of the approximation of sonine polynomials in eqs.([cr100 ] ) and ( [ cr110 ] ) : @xmath56 includes the term of @xmath57 .",
    "we emphasize that , however , the values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 for the steady - state boltzmann equation converge to @xmath45th approximation of sonine polynomials .",
    "it should be also mentioned that there appear artificial qualitative differences in both @xmath53 and @xmath54 for the steady - state boltzmann equation , the steady - state bgk equation and information theory for large @xmath58 .",
    "the graphical results of @xmath28 compared with those of @xmath32 are provided in fig.[cr ] .",
    "both of @xmath28 and @xmath32 in fig.[cr ] are scaled by @xmath59 .",
    "note that @xmath28 is the sum of @xmath32 and @xmath33 in eqs.([cr120 ] ) and ( [ cr130 ] ) .",
    "as fig.[cr ] shows , it is clear that @xmath33 plays an essential role for the evaluation of @xmath28 .",
    "we have also found that there are no qualitative differences in @xmath28 of the steady - state boltzmann equation , the steady - state bgk equation and information theory , while @xmath32 also exhibits a slight deviation from each other .",
    "this deviation in @xmath32 would not be observed if we adopted @xmath26 of the steady - state boltzmann equation for the lowest approximation of sonine polynomials as in the previous papers@xcite .",
    "this is because @xmath26 of the steady - state boltzmann equation for the lowest sonine approximation is identical with the precise @xmath26 of the steady - state bgk equation and information theory .",
    "it should be mentioned that we have found qualitative differences among these theories in some thermodynamic quantities , _",
    "e.g. _ the second - order pressure tensor.@xcite the nonequilibrium effects on the rate of chemical reaction is an insensitive quantity to the differences among the three theories .",
    "@xmath31 is indispensable for the calculation of the nonequilibrium effects on the rate of chemical reaction , since @xmath25 does not appear and @xmath33 is remarkably larger than @xmath32 as fig.[cr ] shows .",
    "thus , the nonequilibrium effect on the rate of chemical reaction will substantiate significance of the second - order coefficients in the solution of the steady - state boltzmann equation , although their importance has been demonstrated only for descriptions of shock wave profiles and sound propagation phenomena@xcite .",
    "we should emphasize that the calculation of the second - order pressure tensor and the application of it to shock wave profiles and sound propagation do not require the explicit form of the second - order velocity distribution function : the second - order coefficients derived by burnett do not include any terms of @xmath43 in @xmath31 of eq.([cr110]).@xcite the nonequilibrium effects we consider appear mainly in the ranges of small @xmath58 where the chemical reaction often occurs , so that our results should be compared with experimental results in the early stage of the chemical reaction@xcite ; a large additional effect due to some modification of the velocity distribution function because of the chemical reaction itself becomes significant as the chemical reaction proceeds@xcite .",
    "we also propose a _ thermometer _ of a monatomic dilute gas system under steady heat flux .",
    "we mean that we can measure the temperature @xmath20 around a heat bath at @xmath60 in the nonequilibrium steady - state system indirectly with the aid of the nonequilibrium effect on the rate of chemical reaction as follows .",
    "the nonequilibrium effect on the rate of chemical reaction in the early stage around the heat bath can be measured .",
    "thus , one can compare the experimental result with the theoretical result shown in fig.[cr ] with @xmath61 .",
    "the difference between the former and the latter will indicate that the temperature @xmath20 around the heat bath is not identical with @xmath60 , that is , @xmath62 . here",
    "@xmath63 should depend upon the heat flux in general .",
    "substituting this temperature expression into the explicit expressions of @xmath64 in eq.([cr60 ] ) , we obtain a new correction term @xmath65 as the nonequilibrium effect on the rate of chemical reaction besides @xmath28 in fig.[cr ] with @xmath61 . at last",
    ", we can estimate the gap @xmath63 so as to make the new correction term match the experimental result .",
    "for example , if @xmath63 in eq.([cr140 ] ) is proportional to the heat flux , we will confirm the relevancy of the slip effect@xcite .",
    "if @xmath63 in eq.([cr140 ] ) is identical with @xmath66 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath67 , the experimental result will agree with the theoretical result from the steady - state boltzmann equation with the _ nonequilibrium temperature _ @xmath68 predicted by jou _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite .",
    "we show the comparison of the theoretical results , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath28 for the steady - state boltzmann equation with @xmath61 and that with @xmath68 , in fig.[theta ] , where @xmath28 is scaled by @xmath69 .",
    "we note that one can obtain the explicit form of @xmath28 with @xmath68 expressed as the dashed line in fig.[theta ] as the sum of @xmath28 from eqs.([cr120 ] ) and ( [ cr130 ] ) for the steady - state boltzmann equation with @xmath61 and @xmath70 from eq.([cr140 ] ) with @xmath71 .",
    "we have found that there is a significant difference between @xmath28 with @xmath61 and that with @xmath68 for small @xmath72 .",
    "this significant difference also appears in @xmath28 for the steady - state bgk equation and information theory .",
    "similar difference in @xmath28 for information theory would also follow from the results of fort and cukrowski@xcite , although they were not interested in the ranges of small @xmath58 .",
    "we emphasize that , however , our proposal written in this paragraph differs from that by fort and cukrowski@xcite which uses a given value measured directly by a thermometer in order to determine @xmath20 or @xmath73 regardless of the temperature of the heat bath .",
