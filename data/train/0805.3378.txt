    "we adopt the following standard notion of local well - posedness , that is , we say that the ivp ( [ equ1 ] ) is locally well - posed in @xmath10 if for any @xmath13 , there exists a positive time @xmath14 depending only on the norm of the initial data , such that a solution to the ivp exists on the time interval @xmath15 $ ] , is unique in a certain banach space of functional @xmath16 , h^s \\big)$ ] , and the solution map from @xmath17 to @xmath18 , h^s \\big)$ ] depends continuously .",
    "if @xmath19 can be taken arbitrarily large , we say that the ivp ( [ equ1 ] ) is globally well - posed .",
    "local well - posedness for the ivp ( [ equ1 ] ) in @xmath10 for any @xmath20 was established in @xcite .",
    "a local solution also exists for @xmath21 initial data , but the time of existence depends not only on the @xmath21 norm of @xmath22 , but also on the profile of @xmath22 . for more details on local well - posedness see @xcite .",
    "@xmath23 solutions of ( [ equ1 ] ) enjoy mass conservation @xmath24 moreover , @xmath25 solutions enjoy energy conservation @xmath26 which together with mass conservation and the local theory immediately yields global well - posedness for ( [ equ1 ] ) with initial data in @xmath25 .",
    "a large amount of works have been devoted to global well - posedness and scattering for the hartree equation , see @xcite-@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .    [ figure ] ' ' , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=60.0% ]    existence of global solutions in @xmath27 to ( [ equ1 ] ) corresponding to initial data below the energy threshold was recently obtained in @xcite by using the method of `` almost conservation laws '' or `` i - method '' ( for a detailed description of this method , see @xcite or section 3 below ) and the interaction morawetz estimate for the solution @xmath8 , where global well - posedness was obtained in @xmath28 with @xmath6 . since authors in @xcite used the interaction morawetz estimate , which involves @xmath29 norm of the solution , the restriction condition @xmath30 is prerequisite . in order to resolve ivp ( [ equ1 ] ) in @xmath10 , @xmath31 by still using the interaction morawetz estimate , we need return to the interaction morawetz estimate for the smoothed out version @xmath7 of the solution , which is initially used in @xcite , whereafter in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the case @xmath3 and we prove the following result :    [ theorem ] let @xmath32 , the initial value problem ( [ equ1 ] ) is globally well - posedness in @xmath33 for any @xmath34 .",
    "moreover the solution satisfies @xmath35 and there is scattering for these solutions , that is , the wave operators exist and there is asymptotic completeness on all of @xmath33 .    as for the case @xmath36 , local well - posedness for the ivp ( [ equ1 ] ) in @xmath10 holds for any @xmath20 .",
    "note that in this case , we have @xmath37 which satisfies the need of the regularity of the interaction morawetz estimate .",
    "hence we only combine `` i - method '' with the interaction morawetz estimate for the solution to obtain the low regularity of the ivp ( [ equ1 ] ) , just as in @xcite .",
    "for the case @xmath38 , theorem [ theorem ] improves the result @xmath6 in @xcite ( see figure [ figure ] ) , where the authors used `` i - method '' and the interaction morawetz estimate for the solution just as in @xcite . in general , in order to prove the almost conservation law , one does nt need to use the monotonicity property of the multiplier @xmath9 . in the present paper , we prove theorem [ theorem ] by combining i - method with an interaction morawetz estimate for the smoothed out version @xmath7 of the solution .",
    "such a morawetz estimate for an almost solution is the main novelty of this paper , which can lower the need on the regularity of the initial data .",
    "last , we organize this paper as following : in section 2 , we introduce some notation and state some important propositions that we will used throughout this paper . in section 3 ,",
    "we review the i - method , prove the local well - posedness theory for @xmath7 and obtain an upper bound on the increment of the modified energy . in section 4 ,",
    "we prove the `` almost interaction morawetz estimate '' for the smoothed out version @xmath7 of the solution . finally in section 5 , we give the details of the proof of the global well - posedness stated in theorem [ theorem ] .",
