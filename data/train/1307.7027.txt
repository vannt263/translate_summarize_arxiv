    "quantum many - body systems give rise to a number of intriguing phenomena such as quantum phase transitions @xcite , topological insulators @xcite or high - temperature superconductivity @xcite . yet , their description is a formidable challenge as the dimension of the hilbert space grows exponentially with number of constituents .",
    "the huge number of degrees of freedom thus renders an exact description in general infeasible , even if one resorts to numerical approaches .",
    "exceptions to this intractability are quantum systems that do not explore their entire hilbert space , where numerical optimization approaches such as the density matrix renormalization group @xcite become efficient descriptions . alternatively one may aim for only obtaining the information of interest about the quantum state of the entire system and try to find accurate and efficient approximations for the sought quantities",
    ". mean - field approaches @xcite can be understood as representatives of this strategy as they only predict properties of a single constituent of the many - body system @xcite .",
    "equations of motion for the part of the quantum state that is of interest to the researcher have been derived in the context of open quantum systems where the density matrix of the entire system is split into a relevant part describing the system and a complementary irrelevant part with the help of the mori projector @xcite .    here",
    ", we introduce an approach to the calculation of local properties of a quantum many - body system by defining a time dependent projection operator that may be viewed as a generalization of the mori projector @xcite . based on this projector , which we coin self - consistent mori projector ( c - mop )",
    ", we are able to derive an integro - differential equation that shares similarities with a nakajima - zwanzig equation @xcite and exactly describes the dynamics of the reduced density matrix of one subsystem ( or a cluster of subsystems ) of a quantum many - body system .",
    "our theory is thus capable of describing stationary states and dynamical evolutions for any situation in which one is only interested in the physics of a part of the system under study .",
    "we thus expect applications of our theory to be very useful for quantum few- and many - body systems .",
    "most notably , it efficiently predicts non - equilibrium dynamics for very long times , applies to two- and higher - dimensional systems in the same way as to one - dimensional ones , and can directly and efficiently calculate stationary states of many - body systems with dissipation . besides these applications our technique generalizes the theory of open quantum systems to scenarios beyond the markov or thermal equilibrium regimes as it takes the back action onto the environment into account .",
    "an increasing number of experimental settings , including arrays of josephson junctions @xcite , ultra - cold atoms @xcite , ion traps @xcite and arrays of coupled cavities @xcite , offer the possibility to generate effective many - particle systems and hence trigger substantial research activity .",
    "one prominent application of these systems are investigations of the unitary dynamics of non - equilibrium states in closed systems @xcite . as a first test of the performance of our method",
    "we thus apply it to calculate local properties of time - evolving non - equilibrium states in closed systems .",
    "we find that it predicts these quantities with very high accuracy for a time range that strongly increases with the size of the considered subsystem and for small subsystems already becomes comparable to the time range reached with the time dependent density matrix renormalization group ( t - dmrg ) .    in many experimental situations",
    ", the samples will however suffer from decoherence and dissipation .",
    "hence dissipative and driven - dissipative quantum many - body systems are currently receiving enormous interest in the search for strongly correlated steady states and non - equilibrium analogs of quantum phase transitions @xcite . as a second test",
    "we thus apply our method to driven and dissipative quantum many - body systems and find that it predicts the values of local quantities with very good accuracy .",

    "finally we give our conclusions and an outlook in section [ conclusions ] .",

    "within our theory we pick one qs of interest and trace out the remaining constituents . ]    for these aims it suffices to determine the reduced density matrix @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the trace over all @xmath0 constituents but the @xmath6-th . to derive an equation of motion for @xmath14",

    "moreover , a markov approximation as applied in open system theory is here not applicable since reduced density matrices of the system and its surrounding are treated on an equal footing and correlation functions of the surrounding can thus not be expected to decay faster than the dynamics generated by the coupling between subsystems .",

    "( [ reduced nze main text ] ) are equivalent to the mean - field or gutzwiller approach which has been exploited with remarkable success in equilibrium physics @xcite and was the starting point for recent investigations of non - equilibrium systems @xcite .",
    "mean - field can thus be understood as an approximation to linear order in @xmath7 for the dynamics of single site reduced density matrices .",
    "our theory therefore forms a systematic generalization of mean - field approaches . as the non - markovian properties , the explicit consideration of correlations via the projector @xmath42 , and entanglement between subsystems are only present in terms of higher than linear order in @xmath11 , eq .",

    "remarkably the time range in which the approximation is highly accurate grows significantly as one applies the c - mop approach to increasingly larger clusters .",
    "this tendency suggest that even substantially larger time ranges should become accessible as one increases the cluster size further . to appreciate this perspective one should compare the time ranges that we are able to accurately describe here ( although only for local quantities ) to those reached with t - dmrg approaches ( @xmath70 ) on high performance computing clusters @xcite .",
