    "it is easy to verify the inequality @xmath161 for @xmath162 and @xmath98 .",

    "otherwise , suppose the maximum weight @xmath164 occurs for some point @xmath165 .",
    "we add @xmath166 to all weights .",
    "this does not change the voronoi diagram defined by @xmath125 , but now the maximum weight @xmath164 is exactly @xmath167 .",
    "next we observe that if now the weight of some point @xmath53 is @xmath168 , then its voronoi region is empty , because @xmath8 is contained in the set @xmath169 , by definition of @xmath167 .",
    "assigning weight @xmath79 to each of those points also results in empty voronoi regions for those points .",
    "altogether , we now have @xmath170 for all @xmath117 .",
    "we have shown the existence of a weight vector @xmath171^n$ ] that satisfies @xmath163 .",
    "this contradicts the minimality of @xmath172 .",
    "hence the minimum value of @xmath108 is @xmath79 .",
    "uniqueness of the partition will be discussed in section  [ unique - sec ] .",
    "again , let @xmath173 , @xmath174 , be an admissible system as in definition  [ admi - defi ] , and let @xmath8 denote a bounded and open subset of @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , we are given real numbers @xmath100 whose sum equals  @xmath80 .    by theorem  [ partition - theo ] there exists a weight vector @xmath102 satisfying @xmath175 now we prove that this subdivision of @xmath8 minimizes the transportation cost , i.  e. , the average distance from each point to its site .",
    "it is convenient to describe partitions of @xmath8 by @xmath9-measurable maps @xmath176 where , for each @xmath4 , @xmath177 denotes the region assigned to @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath178 denote the set of those maps @xmath13 satisfying @xmath179 for @xmath180 .",
    "[ opti - theo ] the partition of @xmath8 into regions @xmath181 minimizes @xmath182 over all maps @xmath183 .",
    "any other partition of minimal cost differs at most by sets of measure zero from @xmath184 .    if the measure @xmath9 were a discrete measure concentrated on a finite set @xmath8 of points , the optimum partition problem would turn into the classical transportation problem , a special type of network flow problem on a bipartite graph .",
    "the weights @xmath28 would be obtained as dual variables . the following proof mimics the optimality proof for the discrete case .",
    "let @xmath185 be defined by @xmath186 for all @xmath23 , and @xmath187 be another map .",
    "if we define @xmath188 , then the cost of map @xmath13 is @xmath189 where the inequality between lines  @xmath190 and  @xmath191 follows from the fact that @xmath192 by the definition of additively weighted voronoi diagrams .",
    "here we have assumed for simplicity that the map @xmath185 assigns every point @xmath193 to _ some _ weighted nearest neighbor of @xmath5 in @xmath0 , according to some tie - break rule . since lemma  [ bisector - volume - lemm ] implies @xmath194 , changing the assignment of those points has no influence on @xmath195 .    both maps @xmath13 and @xmath185 partition @xmath8 into regions of volume @xmath22 , @xmath196 , i.  e. , @xmath197 for all @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , @xmath198 and the same value is obtained for @xmath185 : @xmath199 now the optimality claim follows from  @xmath200 .",
    "we still have to prove uniqueness of the solution , up to a set of measure  0 .",
    "assume that @xmath13 differs from @xmath185 on some set @xmath201 of positive measure .",
    "we are done if we show that the inequality between  @xmath190 and  @xmath191 holds as a strict inequality .",
    "we can remove the points of @xmath59 from @xmath201 , since they have measure 0 . then holds as a strict inequality on @xmath201 .",
    "the difference between  @xmath190 and  @xmath191 is then the integral of the positive function @xmath202 over a set @xmath201 of positive measure .",
    "such an integral @xmath203 has always a positive value : the countably many sets @xmath204 and @xmath205 partition @xmath201 , and thus their measures add up to @xmath206 .",
    "therefore , at least one of these sets has positive measure , and it follows directly that the integral is positive .",
    "in contradistinction to theorem  [ opti - theo ] , the weight vector @xmath60 and the resulting weighted voronoi partition in theorem  [ partition - theo ] is not unique : if @xmath8 is disconnected , changing @xmath60 may move the bisectors between different connected components of @xmath8 without affecting the partition , or only changing it in boundary points of @xmath8 .",
    "however , uniqueness can be obtained under the additional assumption that @xmath8 is pathwise connected .",
    "then in theorem  [ partition - theo ] , the weight vector @xmath207 that partitions @xmath8 into regions of prescribed size is unique up to addition of the same constant to all @xmath28 .",
    "consequently , the parts in the weighted voronoi partition outside of @xmath8 are also uniquely determined .",
    "the proof uses the following lemma .",
    "[ decrease - lemm ] assume that @xmath8 is path - connected , in addition to being an open bounded set .",
    "consider a partition of the point set @xmath0 in two nonempty sets @xmath123 and @xmath137 .",
    "suppose , that , for a given weight vector @xmath60 , all regions @xmath208 have positive measure .",
    "if we increase the weight of every point in @xmath123 by the same constant @xmath209 , then @xmath210 increases , for some @xmath127 .    in this section , we will omit the reference to the set @xmath0 from the voronoi regions and simply write @xmath211 instead of @xmath212 , since the point set @xmath0 is fixed .",
    "it is clear that the regions @xmath213 for @xmath127 can only grow , in the sense of gaining new points , but we have to show that this growth results in a strict increase of  @xmath214 for some @xmath127 .",
    "consider the continuous function @xmath215 and the function @xmath216 , which is defined analogously , and define @xmath217 these two sets partition @xmath2 , apart from some `` generalized bisector '' where equality holds .",
    "roughly , @xmath218 is obtained by merging all voronoi regions @xmath219 for @xmath127 into one set , together with some bisecting boundaries between them .",
    "since these boundaries have zero measure inside @xmath8 , we have @xmath220 let @xmath221 and @xmath222 , where @xmath223 if @xmath224 and @xmath134 otherwise .",
    "it suffices to show that in going from @xmath60 to @xmath125 , @xmath225 increases , since then , by , one of the constituent voronoi regions @xmath226 must increase .",
    "as mentioned , the set @xmath227 can only grow , but we have to show that this growth results in a strict increase of  @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath228 , we are done because @xmath229 has increased to @xmath80 . otherwise , consider a path in @xmath8 connecting some point @xmath230 with some point @xmath231 .",
    "we have , by definition , @xmath232 and @xmath233 .",
    "hence , by the intermediate value theorem , we can find a point @xmath5 on the path with @xmath234 .",
    "this point is an interior point of @xmath235 and @xmath236 , and hence there is a neighborhood of @xmath5 which adds a positive measure to @xmath237 when going from @xmath60 to @xmath125 .",
    "to finish the proof of uniqueness in theorem  [ partition - theo ] , suppose that two weight vectors @xmath238 do the job of producing the desired measures @xmath22 for the regions , but @xmath239 for any constant @xmath240 .",
    "we may assume , by adding a constant to all entries , that @xmath241 , and @xmath242 for some @xmath23 .",
    "we will now gradually change @xmath60 into @xmath125 by modifying its entries .",
    "let @xmath243 . by assumption ,",
    "@xmath123 is neither empty nor equal to  @xmath0 .",
    "we increase the weights of the points in @xmath123 , leaving the remaining values fixed .",
    "the amount @xmath124 is chosen in such a way that @xmath244 for @xmath245 does not decrease below the remaining differences @xmath246 for @xmath247 . by lemma  [ decrease - lemm ] , the measure of the region assigned to some point @xmath248 strictly increases in this process . when the limiting value @xmath124 is reached , the set @xmath123 of points where @xmath244 achieves its maximum is enlarged , and the whole process is repeated until @xmath249 .",
    "during this process , @xmath250 will always be among the points whose weight is increased , and therefore , the measure of its region can never shrink back to the original value  a contradiction .",
    "we have given a geometric proof for the fact that additively weighted voronoi diagrams can optimally solve some cases of the monge - kantorovich transportation problem , where one measure has finite support .",
    "surprisingly , the existence of an optimal solution  the main mathematical challenge in the general case  is an easy consequence of our proof . in remains to be seen to which extent our assumptions on the distance functions",
