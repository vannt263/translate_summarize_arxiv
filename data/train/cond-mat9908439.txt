    "the notion of an ( adaptive ) landscape has proved to be a valuable concept in theoretical investigations of evolutionary change , combinatorial optimization , and the physics of disordered systems . from the mathematical point of view , a landscape consists of three ingredients : ( i ) a set @xmath1 of `` configurations '' which we shall assume to be finite but very large , ( ii ) a cost or fitness function @xmath2 that evaluates the configurations , and ( iii ) some sort of additional geometrical , topological , or algebraic structure @xmath3 on @xmath1 that allows us to define notions of closeness , similarity , or dissimilarity among the configurations @xcite . in the simplest case , @xmath3 is an adjacency relation . in this contribution",
    "we shall consider systems consisting of @xmath4 ising spins and we shall assume that two spin configurations @xmath5 and @xmath6 are adjacent when they differ in the orientation of a single spin , @xmath7 .",
    "we say that @xmath8 is a _ local minimum _ of the landscape @xmath9 if @xmath10 for all adjacent configurations ( neighbors ) @xmath11 of @xmath5 .",
    "the use of @xmath12 instead of @xmath13 is conventional @xcite ; it does not make a significant difference for spin glass models .",
    "local maxima are defined analogously .",
    "the number @xmath14 of local optima in a landscape may serve as a measure for the landscape s ruggedness @xcite .",
    "alternatively , ruggedness can be measured by means of correlation functions such as @xmath15 , defined as the autocorrelation function of the `` time series '' @xmath16 sampled along an unbiased random walk of @xmath17 steps on the configuration space @xcite .",
    "explicitly , @xmath15 can be represented as a quadratic form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the adjacency matrix of the configuration space @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the diagonal matrix of its vertex degrees , i.e. , @xmath22 is the number of neighbors of each configuration , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "it is not hard to verify that @xmath15 is an exponential function if and only if @xmath25 is an eigenvector of @xmath19 .",
    "such landscapes have been termed _ elementary_.",
    "the importance of elementary landscapes derives in part from the fact that all ising spin models @xmath26 with a fixed interaction order @xmath27 are elementary , with an eigenvalue @xmath28 that depends only on @xmath27 and not on the details of the index set @xmath29 of non - vanishing spin interactions . in the case",
    "that the couplings @xmath30 are statistically independent , gaussian distributed random variables , eq.([h ] ) defines derrida s @xmath27-spin hamiltonian @xcite , which for @xmath31 reduces to the well - known sk model @xcite .",
    "the information contained in @xmath15 is conveniently further condensed into the _ correlation length _ @xmath32 . for elementary ising spin models we obtain immediately @xmath33 , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "it would appear that @xmath14 and @xmath34 are two sides of the same coin , and hence we would expect a close connection between the two measures .",
    "indeed , for derrida s @xmath27-spin hamiltonian the expected number of local optima @xmath0 scales like @xmath35 with @xmath36 increasing from @xmath37 for @xmath31 to @xmath38 for @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "this increase of @xmath36 , and hence of the number of local optima , matches the decrease of the correlation length @xmath34 with increasing @xmath27 .    although for random landscapes ( hamiltonians with disorder ) it is often desirable to determine @xmath40 , in most cases one has @xmath41 ( a notable exception is the linear spin chain @xcite ) .",
    "the reason for this equality is that the overlap between two randomly chosen metastable states vanishes with probability one and so the replica approach needed to evaluate the average of @xmath42 reduces to the annealed approximation , which takes the average directly on @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "of course , this is no longer true if one considers specific classes of metastable states ( e.g.  those possessing a given energy density ) or if one adds an external magnetic field to the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "the notion of an _ isotropic _ random landscape was introduced as a `` statistically symmetric model '' , that is , as a random landscape with a covariance matrix @xmath43 that shares the symmetries of the underlying configuration space .",
    "an ising spin glass is isotropic if and only if all interaction coefficients @xmath30 are uncorrelated with mean @xmath44 , and those @xmath30 that belong to a common interaction order have the same variance , @xmath45 @xcite . in other words , the elementary isotropic ising models are exactly the @xmath27-spin hamiltonians with infinite - range interactions",
    ". it is argued at length in @xcite that isotropy can be interpreted as a maximum entropy condition .",
    "the properties of the infinite - range @xmath27-spin hamiltonians are obviously determined exclusively by the number of spins @xmath4 and the interaction order @xmath27 or , equivalently , by the correlation length @xmath34 .",
    "short - range spin models , in which only a small fraction of all @xmath46 possible @xmath27-ary spin interactions contribute to the hamiltonian , i.e. , @xmath47 for most @xmath27-ary spin patterns @xmath48 , deviate significantly from isotropy . for the sk model ( @xmath31 )",
    "a slightly larger number of local optima has been found @xcite than for the infinite - range case @xcite .",
    "the deviation is proportional to @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the number of the nearest - neighboring points in a hypercubic lattice of dimension @xmath51 .    in this contribution",
    "we show that an analogous effect is at work in higher order spin glasses .",
    "in addition , numerical simulations for small values of connectivities do not show a substantial dependence on the patterns of interacting spins .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized in the following way . in section [",
    "sect : sr4spin ] we generalize the variational method of tanaka and edwards @xcite to estimate the @xmath49 corrections to the expected number of metastable states of derrida s @xmath27-spin model .",
    "the results of numerical simulations of fourth - order spin glasses in two- and three - dimensional cubic lattices with small connectivities are discussed in section [ sect : num ] . in section [",
    "sect : labsp ] we investigate the metastable states of a highly frustrated one - dimensional spin model without explicit disorder , namely , the low autocorrelated binary string problem @xcite .",
    "finally , in section [ sect : disc ] we present some concluding remarks .",
    "the coupling strengths @xmath30 in eq.([h ] ) are modeled as statistically independent random variables with the gaussian distribution @xmath52 \\theta[(i_1<i_2 < \\ldots < i_p)]\\ ] ] where @xmath53=1 $ ] if @xmath54 is a valid interaction pattern and @xmath55 otherwise . since in practice",
    "it is not feasible to consider a fixed interaction pattern , we consider all interaction patterns with given fixed coordination number @xmath50 . in other words ,",
    "we sum over all ways of choosing the @xmath56 spins among the @xmath50 allowed ones .    as an immediate consequence of eq.([h ] ) the energy cost of flipping the spin @xmath57 is @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the stability of @xmath60 .",
    "hence any state @xmath5 that satisfies @xmath61 is a local minimum of the random landscape defined in eq.([h ] ) .",
    "thus the number of local minima can be written as @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the summation over the @xmath64 spin configurations and @xmath65 is the dirac delta function .    in the following",
    "we will calculate analytically the expected number of metastable states @xmath66 in the limit of large @xmath4 and @xmath50 with @xmath67 . here",
    "@xmath68 stands for an average over the coupling strengths in all possible interaction patterns with fixed coordination number @xmath50 . using the integral representation of the delta function",
    ", the average over the couplings as well as the summation over the spin configurations can be easily performed @xcite , yielding @xmath69\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    clearly , the expansion of the quadratic term in the argument of the exponential function will lead to interactions terms of second order in the auxiliary fields @xmath70 .",
    "more precisely , using @xmath71   \\sum_i \\phi_i^2 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath72        \\sum_{\\left(i < j\\right ) } \\phi_i \\phi_j\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we write eq.([np0 ] ) as @xmath73\\ ] ] where @xmath74    \\ ,   \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\d\\lambda}{\\pi } \\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathbf{i }   \\lambda\\phi_i - p\\phi_i^2/4}\\ ] ] is the field s weight function . as mentioned before , eqns.([res1 ] ) and ( [ res2 ] ) follow from the sum over all possible interaction patterns with coordination number @xmath50 .",
    "more precisely , for each site @xmath75 there are precisely @xmath50 sites @xmath76 such that @xmath77 is a valid interaction pattern for some choice of @xmath78 .",
    "this notion of site connectivity is independent of the lattice dimensionality ; in fact , it is not necessary to assume that the sites are arranged on a lattice at all : eq.([np ] ) remains valid as long as @xmath50 is site independent .",
    "hence we will refer to @xmath50 simply as the _ connectivity _ of our model .    to proceed",
    "further we must evaluate the integrals in eq.([np ] ) taking the care to collect all terms of first order in @xmath49 .",
    "in particular , note that @xmath79 . this can be achieved through an ingenious variational method introduced by tanaka and edwards in their analysis of the case @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the idea is to add an auxiliary single - particle term to the effective hamiltonian of eq.([np ] ) which is then rewritten as @xmath80^n \\ ,",
    "\\left\\langle \\exp\\left [    -\\frac{p\\left(p-1\\right)}{2z }     \\sum_{\\left(i <",
    "j\\right ) } \\phi_i \\phi_j - \\mathbf{i}\\;t\\;p^{1/2 }     \\sum_i \\phi_i \\right]\\ , \\right\\rangle_{\\!t},\\ ] ] where the average @xmath81 is defined by @xmath82 and @xmath83 for example , we find @xmath84 for @xmath85 . here",
    "@xmath86 is a variational parameter which will be determined so as to maximize @xmath87 . at this point",
    "we can note that the @xmath49 expansion is valid provided that @xmath88 .    as usual , the average in eq.([nt1 ] )",
    "can be evaluated through the cumulant expansion . in particular , we assume that only the first cumulant contains terms of zeroth order in @xmath49 and it is solely these terms that determine the value @xmath89 that maximizes @xmath66 @xcite . of course , this assumption must be verified _ a posteriori _ through the explicit calculation of the higher order cumulants .",
    "evaluating the first cumulant we find that @xmath90 maximizes the expression @xmath91 and so it is given by the solution of the equation @xmath92    the usefulness of the variational approach becomes transparent only when we rewrite eq.([nt1 ] ) replacing @xmath86 by @xmath90 and rearranging the terms : @xmath93\\,\\times\\ , \\left\\langle\\exp\\left(\\xi\\right)\\right\\rangle_{t_m}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 since @xmath95 , it is now straightforward to evaluate the higher order cumulants in the cumulant expansion @xmath96 in particular , we find @xmath97 more generally , we can easily show that @xmath98 is of order @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , to keep terms up to @xmath49 we need to consider only the second cumulant in eq.([ex_c ] ) .",
    "moreover , the leading terms of the @xmath49 expansion ( i.e. , the terms of zeroth order in @xmath49 ) are those outside the average symbol in eq.([nt2 ] ) .",
    "clearly , these results remain unchanged by the fact that for @xmath100 the averages @xmath101 also contribute to the @xmath49 corrections , see eqns.([phi]-[mom2 ] ) .",
    "hence , @xmath102    the next step is to separate the contributions of zeroth and first order in @xmath49 . to achieve this",
    "we note that @xmath90 is determined only by the zeroth order term in the @xmath49 expansion so that eq.([tm ] ) reduces to @xmath103 inserting this result in eqns.([phi ] ) , ( [ mom1 ] ) and ( [ mom2 ] ) , we rewrite eq.([nt3 ] ) as @xmath104 with @xmath105-\\frac{t_m^2}{p-1 }    \\label{a0 } \\\\ \\alpha_1 & = & p^2 t_m^2\\,\\left[\\frac{t_m^2}{\\left ( p-1 \\right ) ^2 } + \\frac{p-2}{2p^2 } \\right]\\ , .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the relevant quantity for comparing the simulations with the analytical theory is the connectivity @xmath50 of a lattice site @xmath108 , that is , the number of spins @xmath109 such that @xmath110 for some @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "the value of @xmath50 depends of course strongly on the interaction pattern , see table  [ tab : psp ] .",
    "note that @xmath50 is independent of the lattice dimensionality and of the number @xmath113 of non - zero interaction strengths per site .",
    "numerical simulations were performed by sampling up to @xmath114 spin configurations from at least @xmath115 different instances ( random assignments of the coupling constants ) for each model and values of @xmath116 between @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "the standard deviations listed in table  [ tab : psp ] are statistical errors from fitting the curve @xmath119 versus @xmath4 to a straight line . with the exception of the cubic models , where we have only few data points , and the models q1q",
    ", q2q , which show quite strong finite size effects , the correlation coefficient of the linear regression is @xmath120 .",
    "by comparison with the numerical estimates for the infinite - range 4-spin glass we suspect that systematic errors might be slightly larger than the statistical errors .",
    "a conservative estimate appears to be an over all accuracy of at least @xmath121 .",
    "we also note that replacing the gaussian distribution of @xmath30 by a uniform distribution with mean @xmath55 apparently does not significantly influence the number of metastable states .",
    "the results of table  [ tab : psp ] show a clear tendency of decrease of @xmath36 with increasing connectivities @xmath50 , as expected from the calculations of section [ sect : sr4spin ] .",
    "moreover , for fixed @xmath50 and within the estimated accuracy , the values of @xmath36 seem to be independent of the geometry of the interaction patterns .",
    "this interesting result indicates that the properties of short - range @xmath27-spin hamiltonians may be fully characterized by a few macroscopic parameters , namely , @xmath4 , @xmath27 and @xmath50 .",
    "indeed , the error between our theoretical predictions for @xmath122 ( see table  [ tab : alpha ] ) and the numerical data for the two - dimensional model with the largest connectivity , qaq ( @xmath123 ) , is only @xmath124 .",
    "( comparison of the simulation data with the tap solution for @xmath125 yields an error of @xmath126 . )",
    "since the estimated systematic error is @xmath127 the agreement between theory and simulations is quite good and provides additional evidence of the minor role played by the geometry of the interaction patterns on the landscape properties of @xmath27-spin models .",
    "the low autocorrelated binary string problem ( labsp ) @xcite consists of finding binary strings @xmath5 of length @xmath4 over the alphabet @xmath128 with low aperiodic off - peak autocorrelation @xmath129 for all lags @xmath76 .",
    "these strings have technical applications such as the synchronization in digital communication systems and the modulation of radar pulses . in the periodic variant of this model ,",
    "one considers @xmath130 with indices taken @xmath131 .",
    "the quality of a string @xmath5 is measured by the fitness function @xmath132 in most of the literature on the labsp the _ merit factor _ @xmath133 is used ( see @xcite ) : using @xmath9 instead is more convenient for explicit computations .",
    "recently there has been much interest in frustrated models without explicit disorder .",
    "the labsp and related bit - string problems have served as model systems for this avenue of research @xcite .",
    "these investigations have shown that labsp has a golf - course type landscape structure , which explains the fact that it has been identified as a particularly hard optimization problem for heuristic algorithms such as simulated annealing ( see @xcite and the references therein ) . in this section",
    "we show that labsp has by far more local optima than one would expect from its correlation length or interaction order .",
    "we use the fact that every function on the hypercube @xmath134 can be written as a linear combination of the @xmath27-spin functions @xmath135 to translate labsp into explicit spin glass form .",
    "explicitly , we have for the aperiodic model @xcite @xmath136 where @xmath137 is a constant factor which does not depend on @xmath4 .",
    "a similar expression can be derived for the periodic model .",
    "there are roughly @xmath138 non - zero second order contributions and on the order of @xmath139 non - zero fourth order contributions . thus the relative weights ( amplitudes ) of the @xmath140-spin and the @xmath141-spin contributions are @xmath142 and @xmath143 , respectively .",
    "for the general definition of @xmath144 see @xcite .",
    "the landscape of labsp thus consists of a ( dominant ) 4-spin hamiltonian plus an asymptotically negligible quadratic component .",
    "the correlation length @xmath34 is therefore given by @xmath145 , which is in excellent agreement with the estimate @xmath146 from numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "we note that the generic @xmath141-spin landscape is derrida s @xmath141-spin hamiltonian @xcite which is a linear combination of all @xmath147 distinct @xmath141-spin functions , while eq.([eq : labsexp ] ) , on the other hand , only contains @xmath148 non - vanishing @xmath141-spin contributions",
    ". the landscape of the labsp thus corresponds to a dilute 4-spin glass .",
    "table  [ tab : psp ] summarizes a numerical survey of the local minima of the labsp .",
    "for @xmath149 we have generated up to @xmath114 spin configurations at random and checked whether they are local minima .",
    "as expected , the number of spin configurations that are local minima increases exponentially as @xmath150 .",
    "the non - exponential pre - factor depends strongly on @xmath151 : separate estimates of @xmath36 from data for @xmath152 show deviations of up to @xmath153 within each of the variants of the labsp , while the standard deviations from linear regression within each data set is almost an order magnitude smaller .",
    "we conclude that the discrepancy of @xmath154 between the best estimates for @xmath155 and @xmath156 , is not significant , since it is about the same size as the @xmath157 dependence .",
    "metastable states are an important aspect of a landscape s ruggedness . in this contribution",
    "we have shown that anisotropies , that is , deviations from a maximum entropy condition , significantly influence the frequency of metastable states , even when the interaction order @xmath27 of the spin glass model , and therefore the correlation length of the resulting landscape , is kept constant .",
    "the correlation length @xmath34 was introduced as an easy - to - compute measure of ruggedness .",
    "later on , it turned out that it has desirable algebraic properties , in particular in the context of fourier transformation theory for fitness landscapes @xcite .",
    "the inability of @xmath34 to reflect the @xmath50-dependence of @xmath66 is certainly a weakness of this measure , in particular when ruggedness measures are used to predict the performance of optimization heuristics .",
    "the anisotropy of short - range spin glass models is the consequence of a large number of vanishing coupling constants compared with the corresponding infinite - range @xmath27-spin model .",
    "following earlier work by tanaka and edwards @xcite we have determined the influence of a finite connectivity @xmath50 on the mean number @xmath0 of metastable states .",
    "our result shows that , to first order in @xmath49 , the number of metastable states increases , i.e. , short - range spin glasses are in general more rugged than their infinite - range counterparts . moreover , the finite @xmath50 effect becomes much more pronounced as @xmath27 increases since the coefficient of @xmath49 diverges like @xmath158 .",
    "of course , large anisotropies due to very small lattice connectivities can not be dealt with by our approach , which is also based on the assumption that all interaction patterns with fixed connectivity are equivalent . however , numerical simulations of several fourth - order spin glasses show that in these cases @xmath0 seems to depend only on the lattice connectivity and not on the detailed geometry of the spin interactions .    the low - autocorrelated binary string problem may be regarded as a strongly anisotropic 4-spin model , where the interaction strength can assume only the values @xmath55 and @xmath159 . this model is a particularly hard optimization problem @xcite . in this contribution",
    "we have shown that it exhibits a number of local optima that is by far larger than expected for a 4-spin model , even taking into account the reduced number of non - zero coefficients .",
    "our results indicate that a large class of generic short - range @xmath27-spin hamiltonians may be fully characterized by a few macroscopic parameters , namely , @xmath4 , @xmath27 and @xmath50 .",
    "particular anisotropic ( non - generic ) constructions , on the other hand , need not conform to this picture , as the example of the labsp shows .",
