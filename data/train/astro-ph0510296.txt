    "as of september 2005 , more than 160 extrasolar planets have been discovered by radial - velocity surveys .",
    "at least @xmath310% are orbiting a component of a wide stellar binary system @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the planets in our own solar system , one of the most remarkable properties of these extrasolar planets is their high orbital eccentricities .",
    "these high orbital eccentricities are probably not significantly affected by observational selection effects @xcite .",
    "thus , if we assume that planets initially have circular orbits when they are formed in a disk , there must be mechanisms that later increase the orbital eccentricity . a variety of such mechanisms",
    "have been proposed @xcite .",
    "of particular importance is the kozai mechanism , a secular interaction between a planet and a wide binary companion in a hierarchical triple system with high relative inclination @xcite .",
    "when the relative inclination angle @xmath4 between the orbital planes is greater than the critical angle @xmath5 and the semimajor - axes ratio is sufficiently large ( to be in a small - perturbation regime ) , long - term , cyclic angular momentum exchange occurs between the planet and the distant companion , and long - period oscillations of the eccentricity and relative inclination ensue . to lowest order , the maximum of the eccentricity oscillation ( @xmath6 ) is given by a simple analytic expression : @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath8 depends just on @xmath4 .",
    "other orbital parameters , such as masses and semimajor axes of the planet and the companion , affect only the period of the kozai cycles .",
    "thus , a binary companion as small as a brown dwarf or even another jupiter - size planet can in principle cause a significant eccentricity oscillation of the inner planet .",
    "our motivation in this study is to investigate the possible global effects of the kozai mechanism on extrasolar planets , and its potential to reproduce the unique distribution of observed eccentricities . in practice",
    ", we run monte carlo simulations of hierarchical triple systems .",
    "we have tested many different plausible models and broadly explored the parameter space of such triple systems .",
    "the purpose of our study is to simulate the orbits of hierarchical triple systems and calculate the probability distribution of final eccentricities reached by the planet . for each model , 5000 sample hierarchical triple systems",
    "are generated , with initial orbital parameters based on various empirically and theoretically motivated distributions , described below .",
    "our sample systems consist of a solar - type host star , a jupiter - mass planet , and a distant  f- , g- or  k - type main - sequence dwarf ( fgk dwarf ) or brown dwarf companion . the possibility of another giant planet being the distant companion is excluded since it would likely be nearly coplanar with the inner planet , leading to very small eccentricity perturbations .    the initial orbital parameters of the triple systems are randomly generated using the model distributions described in table  [ table1 ] . in this paper",
    ", we present six models , each with different initial conditions that are listed in table  [ table2 ] .    lcc parameter & model distribution function & ref .",

    "about 23% of the systems have @xmath25 , leading to negligible eccentricity evolution . for completeness",
    ", biased distributions of @xmath4 and @xmath26 are tested in model  e and f , as an attempt to achieve the best possible agreement with the observations .",
    "with all the binary companions having sufficient inclination angles , model  f shows a better agreement with the observed sample in the low - eccentricity regime .",
    "however , the number of planets remaining in nearly circular orbit ( @xmath27 ) is still larger than in the observed sample .",
    "moreover , model  f produces the largest excess of planets at very high eccentricities ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "note that these extreme models are clearly artificial , and our aim here is merely to quantify how large a bias would be needed to match the observations `` at any cost . ''",
    "in most of our simulations , too many planets remain at very low orbital eccentricities .",
    "the fraction of planets with @xmath24 is at least 25% in our models , but only @xmath29 in the observed sample .",
    "there are several reasons for this overabundance of low eccentricities in our models .",
    "first , the assumption of an isotropic distribution of @xmath4 automatically implies that @xmath30 of the systems have @xmath31 , resulting in no kozai oscillation .",
    "this fraction already exceeds the observed fraction of nearly circular orbits ( @xmath32 ) which is @xmath29 .",
    "systems with sufficient initial relative inclination angles still need to overcome other hurdles to achieve highly eccentric orbits .",
    "if many of the binary companions are substellar or in very wide orbits , kozai periods become so long that the eccentricity oscillations are either suppressed by gr precession , or not completed within the age of the system ( or both ) .",
    "this can result in an additional 15%-40% of planets remaining in nearly circular orbits .",
    "even when the orbits of the planets do undergo eccentricity oscillations , there remains still 8 - 14% that simply happen to be observed at low eccentricities .",
    "thus , our results suggest that the observed sample has a remarkably small population of planets in nearly circular orbits , and other dynamical processes must clearly be invoked to perturb their orbits . among the most likely mechanisms",
    "is planet ",
    "planet scattering in multi - planet systems , which can easily perturb eccentricities to modest values in the intermediate range @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "clear evidence that planet  planet scattering must have occurred in the @xmath34 andromedae system has been presented by ford , lystad , & rasio ( 2005 ) . even in most of the systems in which only one giant planet has been detected so far ,",
    "the second planet could have been ejected as a result of the scattering , or it could have been retained in a much wider , eccentric orbit , making it hard to detect by doppler spectroscopy .    in the high - eccentricity region , where @xmath35 , our models show much better agreement with the observed distribution .",
    "the kozai mechanism can even produce a small excess of systems at the highest eccentricities ( @xmath36 ) , although it should be noted that the observed eccentricity distribution in this range is not yet well constrained .",
    "it is evident that the observed planets are rather abundant in intermediate values of eccentricity .",
    "the kozai mechanism tends to populate somewhat higher eccentricities , since during the eccentricity oscillation planets spend more time around @xmath37 than at intermediate values .",
    "however , this slight excess of highly eccentric orbits could easily be eliminated by invoking various circularization processes .",
    "for example , some residual gas may be present in the system , leading to circularization by gas drag @xcite . in another scenario ,",
    "decreased periastron distances can consequently remove the orbital energy of the planet by tidal dissipation .",
    "this mechanism , referred to as `` kozai migration '' , was proposed by to explain the orbit of hd80606 b. kozai migration can also circularize the planetary orbit .",
    "it is worth to note that the only three massive hot jupiters in the observed sample , @xmath38boo b , gj86 b and hd195019 b ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 days ) are all in wide binary systems @xcite .",
    "their tight orbits with low eccentricity can be a consequence of wider orbits with small periastron distances , initially invoked by the kozai mechanism .    clearly , even by stretching our assumptions , it is not possible to explain the observed eccentricity distribution of extrasolar planets solely by invoking the presence of binary companions , even if these companions are largely undetected or unconstrained by observations .",
    "however , our models suggest that kozai - type perturbations could play an important role in shaping the eccentricity distribution of extrasolar planets , especially at the high end . in addition",
    ", they predict what the eccentricity distribution for planets observed around stars in wide binary systems should be .",
    "the frequency of planets in binary systems is still very uncertain , but the search for new wide binaries among exoplanet host stars has been quite successful in the past few years ( e.g. , mugrauer et al , 2005 ) ."

    "<S> the paucity of near - circular orbits in the observed sample implies that at least one additional mechanism must be increasing eccentricities . on the other hand , the overproduction of very high eccentricities observed in our models could be combined with plausible circularization mechanisms ( e.g. , friction from residual gas ) to create more planets with intermediate eccentricities ( @xmath2 ) . </S>"
