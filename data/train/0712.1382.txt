    "observational evidence suggests galaxies in high - density regions of the universe began to form stars at earlier epochs ( redshifts of @xmath2 or @xmath3 gyr ) and finish within shorter time periods ( of roughly a few gyr ) compared to galaxies of low - density environments . on average , galaxies in low - density environments started to form at @xmath4 and sustained low - level star formation rates even to the present day ( trager et al .",
    "2000 ; kuntschner et al . 2002 ; proctor et al .",
    "2004 ; thomas et al .",
    "what remains unclear are the exact conditions responsible for such an early divergence in the star formation histories of galaxies in high and low - density environments .",
    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are among the oldest ( @xmath5 gyr ) stellar systems in the universe and their formation is associated with major star formation epochs ( see the recent extragalactic gc system review of brodie & strader 2006 ) . as such , systems of gcs provide unique observational tracers for investigating the environmental impact on galaxies at the onset of their formation ( west et al .",
    "2004 ) .    nearly all types of galaxies host gc systems that are bimodal in their observed optical colour distributions ( see e.g. peng et al .",
    "2006 ; strader et al .",
    "2006 ) . since gcs",
    "are mostly old , these bimodal colour distributions are interpreted as evidence for bimodal metallicity distributions , which may imply two major star formation epochs took place in _ most _ galaxies before the universe was @xmath6 gyrs old .",
    "constraining the absolute age or the relative time between these two star formation epochs would provide invaluable constraints on galaxy formation , but is currently a formidable task ( see e.g. strader et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "an alternative method for probing the early epochs is to determine the relative numbers of gcs across different galaxies .",
    "this gives an indication of gc formation efficiency , which in turn helps characterise galaxy star formation histories as a function of galaxy mass , environment , and morphology .",
    "the present work aims to characterise the gc system hosted by the nearby , isolated elliptical ngc  821 .",
    "observational constraints gleaned from this gc system are an important contribution as nearly all previous work examined gc systems in the high - density environments of galaxy groups and clusters .",
    "ngc 821 is an elliptical ( e6 ) galaxy ( m@xmath7 ; de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) with a surface brightness fluctuation ( sbf ) distance modulus of @xmath8 ( @xmath9 mpc ; tonry et al . 2001 ; corrected according to jensen et al .",
    "it reveals a small edge - on disc both photometrically ( lauer 1985 ) and kinematically ( emsellem et al .",
    "stellar ages range from 4.2 to 12.5 gyrs in the literature , which proctor et al .",
    "( 2005 ) show to depend on the region of the galaxy sampled : the central regions are @xmath104 gyrs old rising to 12.5 gyrs at 1 effective radius .",
    "proctor et al .",
    "concluded that the central starburst event represents only a few percent of the total galaxy mass .",
    "furthermore , they confirm a steep metallicity gradient and the alpha - element gradient was found to be flat with radius .",
    "no cold gas component has been detected in ngc  821 ( georgakakis et al .",
    "2001 ; nakanishi et al .",
    "2007 ) . based on planetary nebulae kinematics , romanowsky et al .",

    "an in - depth comparison between this isolated gc system and those found in other environments is presented .",
    "the implications for galaxy formation are discussed .",
    "imaging of ngc  821 was acquired over three nights in late 2005 under good seeing conditions ( average @xmath12 ) with university of wisconsin - madison time using the mini - mosaic ( @xmath13 ) imager installed on the 3.5-meter wisconsin indiana yale noao ( wiyn ) telescope .",

    "figure  [ figdss ] shows the orientation and coverage of the single wiyn pointing .",
