    "the paradigm for the classification of extragalactic jets is based on the fanaroff - riley ( @xcite ) distinction between powerful frii radio galaxies ( and radio quasars ) on the one hand , and low power fri radio galaxies ( and bl lac objects ) on the other .",
    "the ( perhaps overly simplified ) notion is that the jets of fri sources are lossy , often displaying a number of brightness enhancements ( a.k.a .",
    "`` knots '' ) whereas frii jets in radio galaxies ( `` rg '' hereafter ) are often difficult to detect and deposit the bulk of their energy at large distances from the parent galaxy in the radio hotspots. generally speaking , fri jets often terminate within the confines of their host galaxy ( e.g. m87 ) , or at least the well collimated section of the jets are of similar size as their host ( e.g. 3c  31 ) .    obviously this simple interpretation has a number of caveats ; chief amongst them is the effect of relativistic beaming which means that we must make model - based assumptions to imagine what the jets of cyg a would look like if one of them was close to our line of sight ( l.o.s . ) . in the unification hypothesis ( @xcite ) radio quasars and frii rg",
    "are distinguished solely on the basis of their viewing angle . if we were to view the jet of cyg a close to the l.o.s .",
    "would it be a knotty jet like that of 3c  273 ?",
    "our primary interest in this problem arises from the question of the emission processes for the generation of x - rays from jets .",
    "the idea that kpc scale jets have substantial bulk lorentz factors , @xmath0 that would engender copious production of x - rays from inverse compton scattering of low energy relativistic electrons on photons of the cosmic microwave background ( `` ic / cmb '' , @xcite ) came to be the accepted explanation for x - ray emission from quasar and frii rg jets . for fri jets , synchrotron emission from very high energy electrons ( i.e. electrons with lorentz factors @xmath1 ) is thought to provide a consistent suite of physical parameters and simple models were able to produce the observed spectral energy distributions ( sed ) .",
    "thus the classification of x - ray emitting jets tended to follow the fri - frii separation , with the additional notion that fri jets would generally have the x - ray spectral index ( @xmath2 , defined by flux density , s@xmath3 ) @xmath41 whereas @xmath2 for quasars and frii rg s would be @xmath51 .",
    "these values of @xmath2 are consistent with expectations that at the high end of the electron distribution ( n(@xmath6 ) ) , we may expect steep spectra because we may be observing close to an exponential cutoff and/or the initial n(@xmath6 ) has been strongly affected at these energies by synchrotron and ic losses which go as @xmath7 ; and at the low end of n(@xmath6 ) , the emitted spectra ( either synchrotron or ic ) would be flatter .",
    "a number of doubts and counter examples have been raised about the ic / cmb model of x - ray emission of quasar and frii jets . amongst these",
    "are : ( a ) the inability to independently demonstrate that @xmath85 on kpc scales ; ( b ) the assumption that one can extrapolate n(@xmath6 ) from the radio regime ( @xmath9 ) down to @xmath10  100 with a power law of slope -p with p=2@xmath11  +  1 ( i.e. are there really enough low energy electrons ? ) ; and ( c ) the evidence that the x - ray jet of 3c  273 comes from a second synchrotron component rather than ic / cmb ( @xcite ) .    these concerns have prompted us to attempt to devise a different classification scheme for x - ray jets , hoping thereby to achieve a better understanding of the role of ic and synchrotron emissions at x - ray frequencies .",
    "the present contribution reports on the first step of this project : an investigation of the ratio of x - ray to radio flux for x - ray detected knots and hotspots . to do this",
    ", we have embarked on a standard reduction scheme of all x - ray jets detected by the cxo ( chandra x - ray observatory ) .",
    "the finding list for these sources comes from the xjet compilation , see massaro et al .",
    ", this volume .",

    "fri knots are black diamonds ; frii knots are blue filled triangles , and quasar knots are red filled circles .",
    "hotspots are open triangles ( blue frii ) and circles ( red q ) .",
    "the green line is not a fit to anything ; it has a slope of + 1 ( see text).,height=302 ]",
    "our initial focus is an investigation of trends and correlations involving the parameter r=@xmath15 , the ratio of the x - ray flux to the radio flux .",
    "the former comes from our flux map photometry ( 0.5 - 7 kev , with no correction for absorption ) and the latter is calculated as @xmath16 .",
    "these radio fluxes come from vla , merlin , and atca maps at frequencies between 1.4 and 8 ghz .    in order to visualize how r may depend on various parameters , consider a generalized electron spectrum consisting of 3 power laws ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lx ] , left panel ) : the lowest energy segment characterized by an amplitude n@xmath17 , power law index p@xmath17 , covering the range of @xmath6 s from the tens to hundreds .",
    "the next segment , n@xmath18 with a somewhat steeper spectrum would cover the energy range responsible for the normal radio band via synchrotron emission .",
    "the third segment would cover the high end , @xmath19 to 10@xmath20 .",
    "the number of electrons contributing to ic / cmb is meant to be represented by n@xmath17 ; the radio synchrotron by n@xmath18 , and the x - ray synchrotron by n@xmath21 .",
    "obviously the relative values of the n s depends on the three p s , the energies of any low and/or high energy cutoffs , and the energies of the spectral breaks .",
    "considering the emission produced by this electron distribution , the parameters relevant to the value of r can be isolated by :    @xmath22    and for the case of beamed ic / cmb x - rays , of interest here ,    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the extra beaming factor for ic / cmb ( @xcite ) ; @xmath25 is the angle between the jet and the line of sight ; @xmath26 is the photon energy density ; @xmath27 is the bulk lorentz factor of the jet ; and b is the average magnetic field strength . for fri knots ,",
    "the second term is thought to be the dominating contributor so r is determined by the ratio of n s , which , in turn depends on @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and the frequency of the break as well as the frequency of an exponential cutoff , if relevant .",
    "if the x - ray emission of quasar knots ( and hotspots ) is primarily ic / cmb , then the first term dominates and there is a significantly larger number of ( unknown ) parameters .",
    "in addition to the corresponding spectral parameters of the synchrotron case for the ratio of n s , we have the unknown angle to the l.o.s .",
    ", the unknown value of @xmath27 , and the magnetic field strength . a priori , it might seem that one should not expect to find any significant correlation between r and other jet parameters .",
    "we note that while the effect of the magnetic field strength is explicit in the case of ic / cmb , it is also implicitly present for the synchrotron case since a stronger field will usually produce a lower frequency for the high energy cutoff as well as increasing the value of @xmath29 .",
    "thus in general , we may expect stronger field regions to have lower values of r. ( than would otherwise be the case ) .",
    "because of space limitations , we show only one of our first set of plots relating r to other jet properties . the plot shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lx ] ( r as a function of x - ray luminosity ) shows a rather clean separation of fri , frii , and q features .",
    "if all features had the same one - to - one correspondence between x - ray flux and radio flux , then all points would lie on a horizontal line .",
    "the line in the figure has a slope of + 1 and is shown to demonstrate the locus of points which would describe knots that had the same radio flux but different x - ray fluxes .",
    "obviously we do not expect either of these conditions so we are surprised to find the majority of fri knots clustered about a particular + 1 line .",
    "although the quasar distribution follows the same trend , this behavior is not evident for the frii hotspots .",
    "from our preliminary analysis using the ratio of x - ray to radio fluxes , we have found that hotspots tend to have a lower ratio than knots .",
    "features classified as quasar hotspots generally have smaller values of r than quasar knots , and most frii hotspots have smaller r values than fri and quasar knots .",
    "most fri and quasar knots have r values between 1 and 100 .",
    "we have failed to find any significant distinction between fri and quasar knots except for the obvious difference in apparent x - ray luminosity .",
    "we are indebted to a number of colleagues who have generously donated radio maps for our use , and for public access via the xjet webpage .",
    "other radio maps were downloaded from the nrao vla archive survey .",
