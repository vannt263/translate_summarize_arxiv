    ", it is clear that the tree - level soft - breaking terms for minimal stochastic superspace are @xcite :    a.   the bilinear higgs soft term , @xmath14 , b.   the universal trilinear scalar soft terms proportional to the yukawa couplings , @xmath15 , c.   the universal gaugino masses , @xmath16 , d.   the universal soft scalar masses , @xmath17 .",
    "as these soft - breaking terms are renormalised at the quantum level , the relations listed above are only defined as such at some energy cutoff scale , @xmath18 , which becomes an additional parameter of the theory .",
    "the emergence of a pattern of soft - breaking terms dependent only on the parameter @xmath2 categorises stochastic superspace models as a special case of the broader constrained supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm ) . although models with absent soft scalar masses are typically considered excluded at 95@xmath19 c.l .",
    "@xcite ] , this is because the soft - breaking parameters are customarily defined at @xmath20 .",
    "we have found that for larger cutoff scales , @xmath21 , the neutralino becomes the lsp , and consequently , one uncovers a new phenomenologically viable region of parameter space @xcite .",

    "we expand the scope of the analysis primarily to examine a broader range of @xmath2 values and include a calculation of the cold dark matter relic density .",
    "most publicly available sparticle spectrum software packages take the msugra parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 as inputs at the cutoff scale . however , stochastic superspace makes a prediction for the bilinear higgs soft term @xmath28 , rather than explicitly predicting a value for @xmath26 . to facilitate a more thorough analysis of the model , we previously modified the program softsusy 3.1.7 @xcite to swap @xmath26 for @xmath28 as an input .",
    "as branching ratios are required for this analysis , we use the package isajet 7.81 @xcite to calculate the sparticle and decay spectra , using the value of @xmath26 found with softsusy .",
    "various packages included in isatools calculate the relic density and branching ratios of rare decays .",
    "we scan the parameter regions @xmath29 over 150 points in @xmath2 and 50 points in @xmath18 for a total of 7500 points , against the following conditions : @xmath30 in stochastic superspace , the character of the lsp is dependent on one s parameter choice , and will either be the lightest neutralino or the lightest stau .",
    "since r - parity is assumed to be conserved , we enforce the condition in eq . to ensure all instances of a stau lsp are excluded .",

    "although the relic density is lower than observed , this region is not necessarily excluded as the minimal model of stochastic superspace may be extended to include an additional source of dark matter .",
    "furthermore , theoretical uncertainties in the determination of the sparticle mass spectrum can have a significant effect on the calculated value of the relic density , where a 1% difference in mass could affect the calculated relic density by up to 10% @xcite .",
    "it is possible , therefore , that the region of parameter space satisfying the relic density experimental bounds may be larger than depicted in fig [ fig : rd ] .",

    "data collected from proton collisions at the large hadron collider at @xmath42  tev are analysed in a variety of final states .",
    "no excess over the standard model expectation has been observed , allowing one to set exclusion limits in a variety of candidate model spaces such as the cmssm , the model that most closely resembles that considered here .",
    "as the lhc is a proton - proton collider , one expects to dominantly produce coloured objects such as squarks and gluinos , whose inclusive leptonic branching ratios are relatively small , and hence the strongest cmssm exclusions to date result from the atlas searches for events with no leptons and the cms searches for sparticle production in hadronic final states .",
    "the atlas and cms limits have a similar reach in the squark and gluino masses , and here we consider only the atlas zero lepton limits for simplicity .",
    "recent interpretations of lhc limit results can be found in  @xcite .",
    "atlas defined a series of signal regions in which to look for sparticle production , each tuned to enhance sensitivity in a particular region of the @xmath23-@xmath24 plane .",

    "table  [ tab : cuts ] summarises the remaining selection cuts for each region , whilst table  [ tab : results ] gives the observed and expected numbers of events .",
    "these numbers were used by the atlas collaboration to derive limits on @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the cross - section for new physics processes for which the atlas detector has an acceptance @xmath46 and a detector efficiency of @xmath47 .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the atlas collaboration has used the absence of evidence of sparticle production in 1 fb@xmath0 of data to place an exclusion limit at the 95% confidence level in the @xmath23-@xmath24 plane of the cmssm for fixed @xmath25 and tan@xmath55 , and for @xmath56 .",
    "although the stochastic susy model considered here may be considered a subset of the cmssm , it is non - trivial to recast this limit into a constraint on the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath18 . given a signal expectation for a particular model , however , one can easily evaluate the likelihood of that model using the published atlas background expectation and observed event yield in each search channel . by simulating points in the @xmath2-@xmath18 plane",
    ", we can therefore investigate the lhc exclusion reach in stochastic susy space , provided that we can demonstrate that our simulation provides an adequate description of the atlas detector .      in this paper",
    ", we use isajet 7.81 @xcite to produce susy mass and decay spectra then use herwig++ 2.5.1 @xcite to generate 10,000 monte carlo events .",
    "delphes 1.9 @xcite is subsequently used to provide a fast simulation of the atlas detector .",
    "the total susy production cross - section is calculated at next - to - leading order using prospino 2.1 @xcite , where we include all processes except direct production of neutralinos , charginos and sleptons since the latter are subdominant .",
    "the atlas setup differs from this only in the final step of detector simulation , where a full , geant 4 based simulation @xcite is used to provide a very detailed description of particle interactions in the atlas detector at vast computational expense .",
    "it is clear that the delphes simulation will not reproduce every result of the advanced simulation .",
    "nevertheless , one can assess the adequacy of our approximate results by trying to reproduce the atlas cmssm exclusion limits .",
    "we have generated a grid of points in the @xmath23-@xmath24 plane using the same fixed values of tan@xmath55=10 and @xmath25=0 as the published atlas result .",
    "we must now choose a procedure to approximate the atlas limit setting procedure .",
    "atlas use both @xmath57 and profile likelihood methods to obtain a 95% confidence limit , using a full knowledge of the systematic errors on signal and background .",
    "although the systematic error on the background is provided in the atlas paper , we do not have full knowledge of the systematics on the signal expectation , which may in general vary from point to point in the @xmath23-@xmath24 plane . rather than implement these statistical techniques , we take a similar approach to that used in  @xcite , and use the published @xmath44 limits to determine whether a given model point is excluded in a search channel .",
    "we use our simulation to obtain the @xmath44 value for a given model point , and consider the model to be excluded if the value lies above the limit given in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "this allows us to draw an exclusion contour in each search channel , and we estimate the combined limit by taking the union of the individual exclusion contours for each channel ( i.e. the most stringent search channel for a given model is used to determine whether it is excluded ) .    the procedure defined above neglects systematic errors on the signal and background yields and , as noted in  @xcite , this leads to a discrepancy between the delphes results and the atlas limits in each channel .",
    "we follow  @xcite in using a channel dependent scaling to tune the delphes output so that the limits in each channel match as closely as possible `` by eye '' .",
    "we obtain factors of 0.82 , 0.85 , 1.25 , 1.0 and 0.70 for the r1 , r2 , r3 , r4 and rhm regions respectively .",
    "comparisons between the resulting delphes exclusion limit and the atlas limit are shown in figure  [ fig : limits1 ] , where we observe generally good agreement in all channels .",
    "the largest discrepancy is observed in the rhm channel , where we find that one can not get the tail of the limit at large @xmath23 to agree with the atlas limit whilst simultaneously guaranteeing good agreement at low @xmath23 .",
    "this is likely to be due to the fact that we have effectively assumed a flat systematic error over the @xmath58 plane . whereas the atlas results use a full calculation of the systematic errors for each signal point .",
    "it is important to notice however that the _ combined _ limit will be dominated by regions r1 and r2 at low @xmath23 , and thus by choosing to tune the rhm results in order to reproduce the large @xmath23 tail , one can ensure reasonable agreement of the combined limit over the entire range .",
    "where disagreement remains , the delphes limit is less stringent than the atlas limit , and hence using it gives us a conservative estimate of the atlas exclusion reach .",

    "the atlas limit for this signal region is 17 fb , which excludes stochastic superspace points with @xmath59 in the region to the right of the light green colour . ]    figures  [ fig : colz1 ] and  [ fig : colz2 ] show the @xmath44 values ( including the systematic factors ) for each of the atlas search channels .",
    "@xmath44 is most strongly dependent on @xmath2 which is to be expected ; points at low @xmath60 have light coloured sparticles and will thus have large production cross - sections at the lhc . raising the mass scale",
    "essentially reduces the production cross - section leading to a corresponding decrease in the @xmath44 value as one travels left along the @xmath2 axis .",
    "there is little to no dependence of @xmath44 on the cutoff scale for a given value of @xmath2 .",
    "we can conservatively bound the region @xmath61 as consistent with 1 fb@xmath0 of lhc data based on atlas signal region r1 , which is the most constraining in the case of stochastic superspace .",
    "in this paper , we perform a systematic scan of the parameter space of the stochastic superspace model of soft supersymmetry breaking .",
    "its phenomenology is checked against constraints from direct sparticle searches , cold dark matter relic density and the branching ratio of the process @xmath1 .",
    "points that pass these conditions are analysed further , obtaining a value for @xmath44 , which can be directly compared to atlas search limits from the zero lepton channels .",
    "we find that the stochasticity parameter is restricted to the region @xmath61 , while the viable region of the cutoff scale , @xmath18 , shrinks with increased @xmath62 , bounded above by relic density concerns , and below from sparticle mass constraints .",
    "since a prime motivation for the the low - energy supersymmetry is a solution to the hierarchy problem , the increased bounds on sparticle masses seriously undermine its validity .",
    "the required tuning of parameters is estimated at the level of @xmath63 for @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "thus , stochastic supersymmetry still allows a region of parameters that provide a satisfactory solution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "however , as has been shown in @xcite , the mass of the lightest standard model - like higgs boson is predicted in a very narrow range @xmath65 in the minimal model .",
    "this range is outside the @xmath66 region for the higgs mass hinted in the very recent atlas @xcite and cms @xcite data .",
    "if the latest evidence for the higgs mass will be confirmed , the minimal model with stochastic supersymmetry will certainly be excluded , motivating research into a non - minimal implementation of stochastic superspace consistent with these results .",
