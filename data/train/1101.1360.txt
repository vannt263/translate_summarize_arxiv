    "it is known from observational cosmology that our universe is passing through a phase of acceleration .",
    "unfortunately , the present phase of acceleration of the universe is not clearly understood .",
    "standard big bang cosmology with perfect fluid assumption fails to accommodate the observational fact .",
    "however , an accelerating universe is permitted if a small cosmological constant ( @xmath4 ) be included in the einstein s gravity",
    ". there is , however , no satisfactory theory that explains the origin of @xmath4 which is required to be unusually small .",
    "moreover , standard big bang model without a cosmological constant is inevitably pleagued with a time like singularity in the past .",
    "the big bang model is also found to be entangled with some of the observational features which do not have explantion in the framework of perfect fluid model .",
    "consequently an inflationary epoch in the early universe is required @xcite to resolve the outstandinng issues in cosmology .",
    "it is not yet understood when and how the universe entered the phase .",
    "however , the concept of inflation is taken up to build a consistent scenario of the ealy universe .",
    "inflation may be realized in a semiclassical theory of gravity where one requires an additional inputs like existence of a scalar field which describes the matter in the universe .",
    "an alternative approach is also followed where gravitational sector of the einstein field equation is modified by including higher order terms in the einstein - hilbert action @xcite . to address the present accelerating phase of the universe once",
    "again attempts are made where theories with a modification of the gravitational sector taking into account higher order terms that are relevant at the present energy scale are considered .",
    "there are other approaches generally adopted considering modification of the matter sector by including very different kind of matter known as exotic matter namely , chaplygin gas and its variations @xcite , models consisting one or more scalar field and tachyon fields @xcite .",
    "while most of these models address dark energy part of the universe , other models based on non - equilibrium thermodynamics and boltzmann formulation , which do not require any dark energy @xcite , are also considered suitable for describing late universe .",
    "a viable cosmological model should accommodate an inflationary phase in the early universe with a suitable accelerating phase at late time .",
    "an interesting area of cosmology is to consider models which are free from the initial singularity also .",
    "emergent universe ( eu ) scenario is one of the well known choices in this field .",
    "eu models are proposed in different framework like brans - dicke theory @xcite , brane world cosmology @xcite , gauss - bonnet modified gravity @xcite , loop quantum cosmology @xcite and standard general relativity ( gr ) @xcite .",
    "some of these models are implemented in a closed universe @xcite while others in a flat universe @xcite . if eu be developed in a consistent way it might solve some of the well known conceptual problems not understood in the big - bang model .",
    "an interesting class of eu model in the standard gr framework has been obtained by @xcite considering a non - linear equation of state in a flat universe .",
    "the eu model evolves from a static phase in the infinite past into an inflationary phase and finally it admits an accelerating phase at late time .",
    "the universe is free from initial singularity and large enough to begin with so as to avoid quantum gravity effects .",
    "the non - linear equation of state is the input of the model which permits different composition of matter in addition to normal matter as cosmic fluid .",
    "the model has been explored in a flat universe as such universe is supported by recent observations .",
    "the eos considered in obtaining eu model by @xcite is @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are unknown parameters with @xmath8 always .",
    "different values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 corresponds to different composition of matters in the eu model . in the literature @xcite ,",
    "similar kind of non - linear eos has been considered as a double component dark energy model and analyzed to obtain acceptable values of model parameters .",

    "( [ eos1 ] ) is a special form of a more general eos , @xmath9 ; which permits chaplygin gas as a special case ( with @xmath10 ) @xcite .",
    "chaplygin gas is considered widely in recent times to build a consistent cosmological model .",
    "it interpolates between a matter dominated phase and a de sitter phase .",
    "later various modified forms of chaplygin gas were proposed @xcite to track cosmological evolution .",
    "for example models like modified chaplygin gas interpolates between radiative era and @xmath4cdm era .",
    "@xcite showed in their work that such interpolation is permissible even with @xmath11 and a string specific configuration may be phenomenologically realized with an eos considered by @xcite .",
    "recently using eq .",
    "( 1 ) for an eu model proposed by @xcite , we determined various constraints that are imposed on the eos parameters from observational data namely , snia data , bao peak parameter measurement and cmb shift parameter measurement @xcite .",
    "it was noted that an eu model is permitted with @xmath12 .",
    "it is found that the possibility of @xmath13 case is also permitted when we probe the contour diagram of @xmath14 plane with 95 @xmath15 confidence .",
    "the case @xmath13 corresponds to a composition of dust , exotic matter and dark energy in the universe which is certainly worth exploring . in this paper a specific eu model",
    "is taken up where the matter energy content of the universe comprises of dust , exotic matter and dark energy .",
    "using stern data ( table .",

    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 field equations for the model are discussed , in section 3 and 4 we the model is constrained with stern data and stern+bao data respectively .",
