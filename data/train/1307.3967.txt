    "new field of research in the investigation of temporal variation of the fundamental constants has been gaining the ground steadily in both the theoretical and experimental physics for the past few years @xcite .",
    "the important aspects for searching this variation are to establish theories suggesting violation of the einstein s equivalence principle and to support the models like kaluza - klein theory that attempts to unify gravity with the other three unified fundamental interactions @xcite .",
    "this may also probe the multi - dimensionality to space as predicted by the superstring theories @xcite .",
    "these theories predict temporal variation of the fundamental constants including the electromagnetic fine structure constant ( @xmath0 ) in the low energy limit at the cosmological time - scale .    from the experimental front , the signature of possible variation of @xmath1",
    "can be observed from three classes of measurements .",
    "_ geophysical method _ : the data obtained from the isotopic decay in the natural radioactive reactor at the oklo observatory can be used as a tool to probe the variation of @xmath1 as these isotopes corresponds to typically @xmath2 years old and signature of the discrepancy between the decay rate with the present laboratory value indicates a small deviation in the @xmath1 value in this time scale @xcite . _ atomic clock method _ : also , the high precision frequency measurements using the atomic and the singly charged ionic clocks can be used to probe variation of @xmath1 in an elegant manner . in these experiments the time dependency of @xmath1 is inferred by comparing the transition frequencies between at least two clocks @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of these types of experiments is related to their efficient control over the systematic errors .",
    "however , the time period involved to carry out these measurements is of the order of few years only and the typical choice of the candidates for the clocks are either the neutral atoms or the singly charged ions where the relativistic enhancements are typically small .",
    "_ astrophysical method _ : the most natural way of finding out the evidence of possible variation of this constant is by analyzing the atomic and molecular absorption spectra coming out of distant astronomical objects such as the high - red - shifted quasars @xcite .",
    "the time scale at which these events are occurred corresponds to again @xmath3 years back and the statistical uncertainties in these systems can be reduced using the many - multiplet methods @xcite .",
    "the impressive part of considering astrophysical investigation of variation of @xmath1 is that one can consider a large number of spectral lines for the analysis . as a matter of fact",
    ", the spectral lines from the highly charged ions can be investigated in this case which can have extra ordinary large enhancement of the relativistic effects @xcite . in this paper , we analyze the relativistic sensitivity coefficients in mn ix , fe x , co xi and ni xii ions which are not explored before .",
    "the considered mn ix , fe x , co xi and ni xii ions are of particular interest for analyzing their spectra as the ground states of these ions have the fine structure splittings .",
    "the transitions among these states can occur through the forbidden transitions and their wavelengths lie in the ultra - violet ( uv ) region @xcite .",
    "the next excited levels are the @xmath4-states which can decay to the above two lower states through the allowed channel . for an advantage ,",
    "these transitions have wavelengths in the optical region @xcite .",
    "it can be noticed that the fine structure transitions have one more leading order relativistic correction in @xmath5 than the optical transitions . as a fact , the ratios of transition frequencies in the above ions seem to be very promising quantities for carrying out the investigation of any temporal variation of @xmath1 by comparing these values from the spectra coming out of any astronomical objects with their corresponding laboratory values .",
    "it is identified from the solar extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) spectra line that most of them are the emission lines of fe x ion @xcite .",
    "these lines can be used to extract data for the electron density in the solar corona as proposed by jordan @xcite .",
    "mason and nussbaumer had also observed that under typical solar coronal condition , cl like ions such as fe x give rise to most of the prominent spectra @xcite .",
    "the red iron line corresponds to the forbidden transition between the fine structure levels of the ground state of fe x. the other ions co xi and ni xii are also important for the astrophysical study , but they are relatively less abundant in the astrophysical objects .",
    "quite a few emission lines of co xi are observed in the solar plasma , and in the spectra from theta - pinch plasma @xcite .",
    "some of the lines of co xi ranging the wavelengths in between 65 - 340@xmath6 have been observed and tabulated in @xcite .",
    "it is also revealed from the data analysis of high - resolution soft x - ray spectrum of nearby f - type star procyon that the emission lines contains spectra from mn ix and ni xii along with from other highly charged ions @xcite .",
    "moreover , these ions can be reproduced using the accelerators for their laboratory studies .",
    "thus , theoretical calculations of the spectral properties in these ions are necessary .    theoretical determination of the atomic states in the considered ions are very challenging owing to the fact that they contain five valence electrons in their outer most orbitals .",
    "there have been only few studies carried out for the evaluation of the lifetimes of the first excited states using semi - empirical , mean - field and configuration interaction ( ci ) methods ; however there are neither any theoretical calculations nor any observations of the lifetimes of the second excited states are available in the considered ions .",
    "in fact , the higher order relativistic effects are never investigated in these ions .",
    "we have developed here an all order perturbative method in the relativistic coupled - cluster ( rcc ) framework to carry out the study of correlation effects and relativistic corrections systematically in the first three low - lying states of the undertaken ions and would like to calculate precisely the electron detachment energies , the sensitivity coefficients for the variation of @xmath1 involving the first three transitions and the lifetimes of the first two excited states .",
    "we shall also demonstrate the roles of the higher order relativistic effects in the estimation of the sensitivity coefficients .",
    "the energy expression for a state of any multi - electron atomic system can be approximated to @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the atomic number of the atom , @xmath9 is the velocity of light , @xmath10 is the principal quantum number of the state and @xmath11 is the relativistic quantum number with angular momentum of the state @xmath12 .",

    "therefore , this sensitivity is large in the highly charged ions . for the theoretical investigation",
    ", this sensitivity can be estimated by considering a relativistic method to calculate transition frequency ( @xmath16 ) of a transition by expressing them into @xmath17 where @xmath18 corresponds to transition frequency with the laboratory value of the fine structure constant @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the taylor coefficient of the first derivative of @xmath16 and @xmath21 is known as the sensitivity coefficient for the variation of the fine structure constant . for the numerical estimate of the @xmath22-factor",

    "the other predicted values of the lifetime of this state in all these three ions @xcite are either obtained from the astrophysical observations or estimated using lower order many - body methods than our rcc method .",
    "we could not find out any reported values for the lifetimes of the above two excited states of mn ix in the literature .",
    "our estimated results for the lifetimes of the excited states in this ion will be useful for their measurements .",
    "we have developed a relativistic coupled - cluster method to calculate atomic wave functions of the states in ions which have one electron less than the closed - shell electronic configurations .",
    "we successfully employed this theory to calculate the wave functions in the highly charged mn ix , fe x , co xi and ni xii ions .",
    "the dirac - coulomb hamiltonian with other relativistic interactions such as breit , vacuum polarization and self energy corrections is used to incorporate both the relativistic and correlation effects more rigorously in the calculations .",
    "configuration interaction space is approximated at the singles and doubles excitation level , however they are elevated by the inclusion of the important triple excitations in a self - consistent manner through a perturbative approach .",
    "we have obtained the detachment energies within sub - one percent accuracy and estimated the sensitivity coefficients for the investigation of any possible temporal variation of the fine structure constant at the same level of accuracy .",
    "roles of various relativistic and correlation effects are demonstrated explicitly .",
    "further more , we determined the transition matrix elements due to the e1 , m1 and e2 channels from the considered excited states in the above ions . using these matrix elements",
    ", we evaluated the transition probabilities , the oscillator strengths and the lifetimes of the excited states and compared them with the available experimental and other predicted values .",
    "our estimated results are found to be more precise than the previously reported results .",
    "the corresponding experimental results for some of our reported values are not known , hence our calculated values will serve as the benchmark results for their future measurements .",
    "we thank yashpal singh for his partial contributions in the developed method .",
    "the calculations were carried out using prl 3tflop hpc cluster , ahmedabad .",
