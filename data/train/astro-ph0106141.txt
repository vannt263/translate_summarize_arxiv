    "a growing body of observational and theoretical evidence suggests that some massive globular clusters may contain more than @xmath1 neutron stars ( nss ) .",
    "however , the presence of even as few as @xmath9 nss is difficult to reconcile with the large ns `` kicks '' inferred from proper motion studies of single , young radio pulsars in the galactic disk .",
    "the problem is that globular clusters have central escape speeds @xmath10 , while it is widely thought that most nss are born with speeds @xmath5 .",
    "this is the essence of the ns _ retention problem _ in globular clusters .",
    "if one accepts the conventional wisdom regarding ns kicks , then only a very small fraction of nss that are remnants of isolated progenitors should be retained in a globular cluster .",
    "@xcite found that a maxwellian distribution in kick speeds , with a mean of @xmath11 , is consistent with data on pulsar proper motions .",
    "this distribution predicts that only @xmath12 of nss are born with speeds @xmath13 , and @xmath14 with speeds @xmath15 . if one adopts an initial mass function derived from stars in the solar neighborhood ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it can be shown that @xmath3 nss will be formed in a cluster that initially contains @xmath2 stars .",
    "a retention probability of @xmath16 predicts that @xmath17 nss should be present in a massive globular cluster such as 47 tuc , where we have assumed that the cluster has not lost a significant fraction of its mass .",
    "such a small number of nss in 47 tuc is incompatible with the observational sample of more than 20 millisecond radio pulsars @xcite when selection effects are taken into account .",
    "drukier ( 1996 ; using the results of brandt & podsiadlowski 1995 ) and @xcite have demonstrated quantitatively that if a ns is formed in a massive binary system , then there is a significant probability that the ns will remain in the binary following the supernova ( sn ) explosion , and that the recoil speed of the system could be sufficiently small to allow it to be retained in the cluster .",
    "while these studies provided a useful verification of the potential importance of massive binaries , they did not involve a systematic population study to determine a realistic ns retention fraction .",
    "our primary goal in this paper is to make a detailed quantitative assessment of the role of massive binaries in retaining nss in globular clusters .",
    "this calls for a realistic description of the population of primordial binaries , as well as a sufficiently detailed consideration of the relevant stellar evolution processes that precede the first sn explosion . to this end , we have developed a monte carlo population synthesis code that follows each of an ensemble of massive , primordial binaries from the main - sequence phase , through any important episodes of mass transfer , up to and immediately beyond the time of the first sn .",
    "we have attempted to make the paper self - contained , so that much of the relevant background material and associated references are provided .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in   [ sec : nsgc ] we review the evidence indicating that nss may be quite abundant in certain massive globular clusters .",
    "an historical overview of the debate regarding ns kicks is presented in   [ sec : kicks ] . in ",
    "[ sec : ps ] we describe the various elements of our monte carlo population synthesis code .",
    "a semi - analytic treatment of massive binary population synthesis and ns retention is given in   [ sec : est ] , which we intend to facilitate the interpretation of the results of our detailed numerical calculations presented in ",
    "[ sec : nsr ] .",
    "the main results of our study are reviewed in ",
    "[ sec : con ] , and we evaluate the possibility that binaries provide a robust solution to the retention problem . finally , we speculate in   [ sec : dis ] on possible alternative solutions to the ns retention problem .",
    "several tens of millisecond pulsars ( msps ) , a dozen bright x - ray sources , and numerous low - luminosity x - ray sources have been detected in the galactic globular cluster system .",
    "see table 1 for a list of clusters that may contain large numbers of nss .",
    "the nature of the pulsars is clear : these are rapidly spinning nss , many of which have binary companions .",
    "the luminous cluster x - ray sources are all low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) powered by accretion onto a ns .",
    "an accepted familial relationship exists between lmxbs and the majority of msps , the former being the evolutionary progenitors of the latter .",
    "recent observations @xcite provide tantalizing evidence that many of the low - luminosity x - ray sources may be msps for which radio pulsations have not yet been detected ( see , however , * ? ? ?",
    "more refined pulsar searches , deeper x - ray observations , and thorough theoretical population studies will advance our understanding of the cluster population of nss , and in turn may provide powerful new insights into the formation and evolution of globular clusters .",
    "we now briefly review what is known and what is speculated regarding nss in globular clusters .",
    "camilo et al .",
    "( 2000 ; see also freire et al .",
    "2000 ) , using the parkes radio telescope , have detected more than 10 msps in the globular cluster 47 tuc , bringing the current total to over 20 . with a cursory analysis of the selection effects and a reasonable pulsar luminosity function",
    ", @xcite estimated that 47 tuc may contain @xmath18 potentially observable msps , and therefore the total number of nss in 47 tuc is expected to be even larger .",
    "47 tuc is a rich and relatively nearby cluster ( distance @xmath19 ) , and thus has been the subject of much study , especially in recent years .",
    "unfortunately , other clusters with properties similar to 47 tuc have not yet received as much attention . however , there is compelling observational evidence that at least one other cluster contains in excess of 100 nss .",
    "@xcite found significant diffuse radio emission from the core of the massive globular cluster terzan 5 .",
    "these authors estimated that this diffuse component may be attributable to between 60 and 200 potentially observable pulsars , and claim that this range may represent a rather severe underestimate of the total number of pulsars in the cluster .",
    "thus far , two msps have been detected in terzan 5 @xcite .",
    "many of the members of the well - known class of bright x - ray sources in globular clusters , with x - ray luminosities @xmath20 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , exhibit type i x - ray bursts @xcite and are therefore accreting nss in binary systems .",
    "in fact , 7 of the 12 known bright sources have a well - measured or constrained binary period @xcite .",
    "each of these objects resides in a different globular cluster ( table 1 ) .",
    "while this sample of x - ray binaries does not constitute a large number of nss in itself , the existence and properties of these systems may have important implications regarding the evolution of the ns population in their respective host clusters ( see   [ sec : theory ] below ) .",
    "not as well known , and certainly not as well understood , is the class of low - luminosity cluster x - ray sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with @xmath21 , where the lower limit is set by detection sensitivities .",
    "prior to the launch of the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ , fewer than 50 of these faint sources had been discovered in the entire galactic globular cluster system ( see verbunt 2001 for a recent analysis of the _ rosat _ database ) , primarily with the _ rosat _ and _ einstein _ satellites .",
    "however , recent deep _ chandra _ observations of 47 tuc have revealed @xmath22 faint sources in this cluster alone @xcite , whereas only 9 had been confirmed previously @xcite .",
    "there is growing evidence that the majority of the faint x - ray sources in 47 tuc may be nss , perhaps msps that have not yet been detected at radio wavelengths .",
    "all of the 15 msps in 47 tuc with well - measured radio timing positions @xcite have counterparts in the _ chandra _ images @xcite .",
    "further multiwavelength observations are required to determine the true distribution of objects contributing to the population of low - luminosity sources .",
    "variations in the number of detected radio pulsars and x - ray sources from cluster to cluster may be attributed to the distances of the clusters , selection effects inherent in the observations , as well as differences between the intrinsic ns populations .",
    "predictions of the total number of potentially observable nss  in the form of msps or accretion - powered x - ray sources  present in a globular cluster are difficult .",
    "empirical likelihood estimates based on the observational sample are hindered by small - number statistics and uncertainties regarding selection effects .",
    "theoretical studies aimed at accounting for the numbers and properties of the detected pulsars involve models that utilize various uncertain stellar evolution and dynamical processes .",
    "large - scale population studies of the formation and evolution of x - ray binaries and msps in globular clusters have only recently been undertaken ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the dense stellar environment in a globular cluster allows for dynamical binary formation channels not possible in the galactic disk , such as two - body tidal capture ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the absolute probabilities of dynamical encounters depend on the local stellar environment and thus implicitly on the dynamical evolution of the cluster .",
    "this nonlinear linkage between _ local _ dynamical processes and the _ global _ cluster evolution poses significant computational problems , but the potential rewards are far - reaching .",
    "such population studies promise to be a powerful tool that relates the current ns population to the formation and evolution of globular clusters .",
    "preliminary calculations @xcite indicate that a large initial pool of single nss ( @xmath23 ) may be required to explain the handful of very short - period binary radio pulsars in 47 tuc ; i.e. , the formation efficiency is quite low .",
    "short - period binary msps and lmxbs in other clusters may be good indicators of an initially large number of nss in those clusters as well .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate the conditions that favor the retention of such a large ns population .",
    "it was suggested four decades ago by blaauw ( 1961 ; see also boersma 1961 ) , before the discovery of the first radio pulsar @xcite , that there may be a population of massive - star remnants ( neutron stars ) in the galaxy with anomalously large space velocities , acquired when the ns progenitor explodes in a binary system .",
    "if the orbit is circular and the explosion is spherically symmetric , then the compact remnant is liberated from its companion if more than one - half of the initial mass of the binary is lost in the sn .",
    "@xcite proposed this mechanism to explain the famous `` runaway '' o and b stars ( see hoogerwerf , de bruijne , & de zeeuw 2001 for a recent discussion ) .",
    "@xcite analyzed the data on some forty pulsars known at that time .",
    "they found that the pulsars had an average scale height of @xmath24 above the galactic plane , in contrast to the smaller scale height ( @xmath25 ) of massive o and b stars .",
    "@xcite concluded that pulsars are born with an average speed of @xmath26 , and attributed this speed to a binary origin .    by 1980 , 26 pulsars had reasonably accurate interferometrically determined proper motions .",
    "@xcite showed that the observed pulsars had a three - dimensional rms speed of @xmath27 , and a vertical scale height of @xmath28 .",
    "thus , pulsars are even faster and more dispersed than indicated in the study by @xcite .",
    "based on the data of @xcite , @xcite adopted a modified lorentzian distribution of pulsar speeds , @xmath29^{-2 } ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the rms speed .",
    "the best agreement with the data was found with @xmath31 .",
    "the next major step in the study of the kinematics of the galactic pulsar population came with the work of @xcite .",
    "this analysis considered a total of 99 pulsars , 86 of which had interferometric proper motions or upper limits , and an additional 13 pulsars with only scintillation speed measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . @xcite and",
    "@xcite noted a strong selection effect against detecting high - velocity pulsars .",
    "fast pulsars born in the galactic disk rapidly move away from the plane and may only spend a small fraction of their radio lifetimes in the flux - limited volume .",
    "the vertical egress of fast pulsars thus implies a mean speed for the detectable pulsar population that is lower than the true mean pulsar birth speed .",
    "@xcite attempted to account for this effect by utilizing only those pulsars with characteristic ages less than @xmath32 , thus reducing the analyzed sample to 29 objects . using a revised dispersion - measure distance scale @xcite , @xcite derived a mean pulsar speed of @xmath33 and indicated that @xmath34 of pulsars have speeds less than @xmath35 .",
    "the larger proportion of fast pulsars ( speeds @xmath5 ) began to cast doubt on the notion that the high velocities were acquired as a result of the binary `` slingshot '' effect ( see , however , iben & tutukov 1996 and the rebuttal by van den heuvel & van paradijs 1997 ) .",
    "@xcite    was the first to suggest that large pulsar speeds may result from an asymmetry intrinsic to the sn explosion .",
    "this is now a widely held view .",
    "proposed physical mechanisms for natal ns kicks include purely hydrodynamical models , as well as scenarios that involve asymmetric neutrino emission , possibly correlated with the orientation and strength of the magnetic field within the proto - neutron star @xcite .",
    "for a recent review of various natal kick mechanisms , see @xcite .",
    "harrison & tademaru ( 1975 ; see also lai , chernoff , & cordes 2001 ) have proposed an alternative mechanism for the acceleration of pulsars that involves asymmetric dipole radiation _",
    "after _ the pulsars has been formed , the so - called `` electromagnetic rocket '' mechanism .    since the work of @xcite , a number of authors have reanalyzed the pulsar proper motion data with more sophisticated treatments of selection effects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "each of these studies employed a different statistical methodology , but all found a mean three - dimensional pulsar speed in excess of @xmath36 . @xcite and",

    "@xcite found evidence for a bimodal kick distribution , with @xmath40 of the pulsars contained in a maxwellian component with a dispersion of @xmath41 , and the remaining nss contained in a high - speed component with a dispersion of @xmath42 . in all of these investigations ,",
    "a maxwellian distribution was adopted by convention .",
    "however , both @xcite and @xcite stress that , while it is likely that the mean birth speed of pulsars is large , and that high - velocity pulsars are under - represented in the observational sample , the data do not constrain the functional form of the underlying kick distribution ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , nor do the data suggest a physical mechanism for the kick .    for completeness , we also list a number of pieces of indirect evidence for ns kicks .",
    "\\(1 ) pulsar velocities @xmath43 have been inferred from pulsar - supernova remnant associations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by dividing the distance from the rough geometrical center of the remnant by the characteristic spin - down age of the pulsar ; however , the reliability of some of these estimates is questionable ( see * ? ? ?",

    "\\(3 ) @xcite have found that the b - star companion to the pulsar psr j0045 - 7319 in the smc has a spin that is inclined with respect to the orbital angular momentum vector , and may , in fact , have retrograde rotation .",
    "this is convincing evidence that the pulsar received a kick with a significant component perpendicular to the pre - sn orbital plane .",
    "\\(4 ) systems with moderate - to - high eccentricities ( @xmath44 ) seem to dominate the sample of be / x - ray binaries with measured orbital parameters ( see * ? ? ?",
    "these eccentricities may require kick speeds @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "however , a number of be / x - ray binaries ( xte j1543 - 568 , 4u 0352 + 30/x per , 2s 1553 - 54 , gs 0834 - 43 , @xmath46 cas ; see table 6 ) exhibit relatively low eccentricities ( @xmath47 ) and orbital periods sufficiently long that tidal circularization could not have played a role @xcite . a detailed study of x per/4u 0352 + 30 @xcite revealed that the present orbit ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) is entirely consistent with the neutron star having been born with no kick .",
    "this may indicate that the underlying ns kick distribution is not simply related to the speed distribution of isolated pulsars ( see   [ sec : rot ] ) .",
    "large uncertainties regarding natal ns kicks imply that a comprehensive population study must incorporate a variety of kick distributions . in our simulations of the formation of nss in globular clusters , we consider a single - component maxwellian kick distribution as well as the modified lorentzian proposed by @xcite ( see figure [ fig : kicks ] ) .",
    "aside from what little information can be inferred from the current cluster population of stars , there is insufficient data to tightly constrain the distributions in main - sequence masses and orbital parameters of the massive primordial binaries in globular clusters .",
    "however , a combination of theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that the process of star formation ( single and binary ) is quite generic in a qualitative sense ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , and that the general `` rules '' that apply to star formation in the galactic disk may also apply to regions of high stellar density , such as globular clusters .",
    "fortunately , there is a large body of work on the binary population in the galactic disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for these reasons , and for lack of any concrete alternative suggestions ,",
    "our population synthesis study of massive binaries in globular clusters parallels similar studies of massive binaries in the disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our population synthesis code is comprised of three basic elements , corresponding to the three main evolutionary stages of a massive binary : ( i ) the masses and orbital parameters are chosen from appropriate distribution functions , ( ii ) analytic approximations are used to follow the binary stellar evolution through any important episodes of mass transfer , and ( iii ) the dynamical influence of the first sn explosion is computed .",
    "we now discuss each of these elements in detail .",
    "we define a _ massive _ primordial binary as a system where at least one component has a large enough main - sequence mass that it would yield a neutron star remnant if left to evolve in isolation .",
    "the main - sequence mass threshold for ns formation is @xmath50 , with a weak dependence on metallicity ( see   [ sec : est ] ) .",
    "hereafter , we refer to the initially more massive component of the binary as the _ primary _ and the initially less massive component as the _ secondary_. the main - sequence masses of the primary and secondary are denoted by @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively , and we define the main - sequence mass ratio as @xmath53 .    various authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have found that the primary masses in close binaries are consistent with the initial mass function ( imf ) of single stars .",
    "we draw primary masses from a single power - law imf , which is appropriate for massive stars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "we choose values of @xmath56 in the range 23 , where @xmath57 corresponds to a salpeter imf @xcite . for our standard model ( see   [ sec : stan ] ) , we adopt @xmath58 .",
    "an isolated star with @xmath59 is assumed to leave a black hole remnant rather than a ns .",
    "the precise value of @xmath60 is unknown , but is probably @xmath61 .",
    "because the imf sharply decreases with increasing mass , our results do not depend strongly on the value of @xmath60 .",
    "it is generally believed that the main - sequence masses of binary components are correlated ( e.g. , abt & levy 1978 ; garmany , conti , & massey 1980 ; eggleton , fitchett , & tout 1989 ) . observations of massive binaries suggest that equal masses may be favored ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , presumably as a result of the formation process .",
    "however , serious selection effects hamper the determination of the true mass ratio distribution , and other authors have found that low - mass companions to massive primaries appear to be more likely ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for the distribution function , @xmath62 , we consider both increasing and decreasing functions of @xmath63 , as encapsulated by the power - law form @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "we take @xmath66 for our standard model ( see   [ sec : stan ] ) .",
    "it is often assumed in population studies of the sort we have undertaken that the orbits of primordial binaries are circular . however , since the process of binary formation is only poorly understood , there is no a priori justification for suggesting that massive , primordial binaries should have small eccentricities .",
    "the situation is less clear in globular clusters , where dynamical interactions may influence binary formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , it is expected that the binary will eventually circularize if the orbit is sufficiently compact that mass transfer will take place . from here on we only consider circular primordial binaries .",
    "there exists at least one important caveat to the circularization assumption stated above .",
    "eccentricities of @xmath67 are seen among the wide , interacting vv cephei binaries , which consist of a massive red supergiant and an early - type b star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the vv cephei systems are the widest of the known massive , interacting binaries , with periods @xmath68 , and their significant eccentricities may indicate that not enough time has elapsed for the system to circularize .",
    "the growth of the large red - supergiant envelope occurs over a relatively short timescale of @xmath69 , while the circularization timescale varies as @xmath70 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath71 is the binary semimajor axis and @xmath72 is the radius of the supergiant .",
    "therefore , the components of the observed vv cephei binaries have experienced strong tidal interactions only very recently , in terms of the evolutionary history of the more massive star .    the binary separation , @xmath71 , is chosen from a distribution that is uniform in the logarithm of @xmath71 ( abt & levy 1978 ; see , however , duquennoy & mayor 1991 ) : @xmath73^{-1 } a^{-1}\\ ] ] for given component masses , the lower limit , @xmath74 , is determined from the constraint that neither star overflows its roche lobe on the main sequence . the upper limit , @xmath75 , is somewhat arbitrary ; in practice , we assume @xmath76 .      owing to its larger mass , the primary will be the first star to leave the main sequence .",
    "the subsequent binary evolution depends on the size of the roche lobe that surrounds the primary . for circular orbits , the volume - equivalent radius of the roche lobe of the primary",
    "is well approximated by the formula due to @xcite : @xmath77 where @xmath71 in this equation represents the constant orbital separation .",
    "the radius of the roche lobe of the secondary , @xmath78 , is obtained by replacing @xmath63 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : roche ] ) with @xmath79 .    left to evolve in isolation , the primary would grow to a maximum radius of @xmath80 ( the value depends sensitively on mass , metallicity , and especially assumptions about stellar winds ) .",
    "so , if the orbit is sufficiently compact ( @xmath81 ) , the primary may grow to fill its roche lobe .",
    "the value of @xmath82 is used to determine the evolutionary state of the primary when it begins to transfer matter through the inner lagrange point .",
    "it is particularly important to distinguish between mass transfer that is dynamically stable ( proceeding on the nuclear or thermal timescale of the primary ) and mass transfer that is dynamically unstable ( proceeding on the dynamical timescale of the primary ) .",
    "for the case where the mass donor is more massive than the accretor , dynamical instability is typically attributed to one of two root causes .",
    "if the star grows faster than its roche lobe ( or the roche lobe shrinks faster than the star does ) , a phase of runaway mass transfer may ensue .",
    "in particular , stars with deep convective envelopes tend to expand in response to mass loss ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , while the roche lobe generally shrinks .",
    "also , for systems with extreme mass ratios , the primary may not be able to achieve synchronous rotation with the orbit , causing the components to spiral together ; this is the classic darwin tidal instability ( darwin 1879 ; see also hut 1981 ) . the evolutionary state of the primary when it fills its roche lobe is a good indicator of the physical character of the subsequent mass transfer and binary stellar evolution .",
    "following kippenhahn & weigert ( 1966 ; see also lauterborn 1970 and podsiadlowski , joss , & hsu 1992 ) , we distinguish among three evolutionary phases of the primary at the onset of mass transfer .",
    "case a evolution corresponds to core hydrogen - burning , case b refers to the shell hydrogen - burning phase , but prior to central helium ignition , and case c evolution begins after helium is exhausted in the core .",
    "these three cases ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : radev10 ] and [ fig : radev15 ] ) provide a rough framework for categorizing binary stellar evolution during mass transfer .",
    "of course , not all systems will undergo roche lobe overflow .",
    "a large fraction of binaries will be sufficiently wide that the primary and secondary evolve as isolated stars prior to the first sn .",
    "we refer to such detached configurations as case d.    of the three broad categories of mass transfer , case a evolution is potentially the most problematic .",
    "perhaps the most likely outcome is a merger of the two stars following a contact phase , wherein both stars fill their roche lobes , leaving a massive single star @xcite .",
    "for a recent detailed discussion of the complex evolution processes that occur during case a mass transfer and the possible outcomes , see nelson & eggleton ( 2001 ) and wellstein , langer , & braun ( 2001 ) .",
    "fortunately , the subtleties of case a evolution may essentially be overlooked in the present study .",
    "the range in orbital separations admitted by case a is @xmath83 , which comprises @xmath84 of the primordial binary population .",
    "in addition , if the majority of case a systems merge as expected , then a detailed consideration of case a evolution is unnecessary , since our focus is on how binarity impacts the retention problem . in our population synthesis code ,",
    "case a mass transfer is treated in precisely the same way as early case b mass transfer ( see below ) .",
    "this treatment is certainly unrealistic , but it is a highly optimistic scenario in regard to the retention problem , and so functions to provide the maximum retention fraction for the case a systems .",
    "two important subcases comprise case b. _ early _ case b ( case @xmath85 ) mass transfer occurs when the primary fills its roche lobe as it evolves through the hertzsprung gap ( subgiant branch ) . in this case , the envelope of the primary is still mostly radiative and the mass transfer is thought to be initially stable for a wide range of mass ratios . _ late _ case b ( case @xmath86 ) mass transfer occurs when the primary fills its roche lobe as it evolves up the first giant branch .",
    "case @xmath86 mass transfer is characterized by a deep convective envelope , in which case it is likely that mass transfer will initially take place on the dynamical timescale of the primary , leading to a common - envelope ( ce ) phase ( see   [ sec : mtanal ] ) .",
    "the range in orbital separations of case b systems is @xmath87 , which contains @xmath88 of the primordial binary population .    for stars of mass @xmath89 , core helium - burning",
    "is typically accompanied by a significant decrease in stellar radius ( see fig . [",
    "fig : radev10 ] ) , so that the primary can not fill its roche lobe during this time .",
    "after helium is exhausted in the core , the star develops a deep convective envelope and begins to ascend the hayashi track .",
    "we refer to this phase as late case c ( case @xmath90 ) .",
    "we assume that case @xmath90 mass transfer is dynamically unstable , as we do for case @xmath86 ( see , however , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for stars more massive than @xmath91 ,",
    "stellar evolution calculations do not provide a self - consistent physical picture that simultaneously accounts for observations of massive stars in high- and low - metallicity environments ( e.g. , the milky way and the smc , respectively ) . one main problem is to explain the ratio of blue to red supergiants among massive stars , as a function of metallicity ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for these massive stars ,",
    "it is possible for helium to ignite in the core while the star is traversing the hertzsprung gap and is still mostly radiative .",
    "it is unclear how the radius behaves during the subsequent phase of core helium - burning .",
    "the radius may shrink somewhat , so that roche lobe overflow is impossible during this phase .",
    "however , the radius may continue to increase after a short plateau ( a so - called `` failed blue loop '' in the hr diagram ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : radev15 ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is theoretically possible for mass transfer to begin during core helium - burning , but the allowed range in stellar radii is sufficiently small that we neglect this possibility . following core helium - exhaustion",

    "unless the initial mass ratio is close to unity , it is likely that the majority of case a , @xmath85 , and @xmath92 systems will evolve into a contact configuration @xcite . shortly after the primary first fills its roche lobe , the mass transfer rate rises to values of order @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the thermal timescale of the primary .",

    "one of two distinct outcomes follows the explosion : ( i ) the ns and the secondary are gravitationally bound , with new orbital parameters and a new cm velocity , or ( ii ) the binary is disrupted , with the ns and secondary receding along hyperbolic trajectories relative to the new cm . in the former case , the cm speed of the binary is compared to the cluster escape speed in order to determine if the ns , along with its binary companion , is retained in the cluster , while in the latter case the speed of the ns at infinity , computed in the pre - sn cm frame of reference , is compared to the escape speed .",
    "when the characteristic kick speed is large , the mean eccentricity for the bound post - sn binaries may approach @xmath153 . in a significant fraction of these systems , the closest approach of the ns immediately after the sn is smaller than the radius of the secondary , with the likely outcome that the ns spirals in to the envelope of the secondary to form a thorne - ytkow object ( leonard , hills , & dewey 1994 ; brandt & podsiadlowski 1995 ; see also   [ sec : psnev ] for a more thorough discussion ) .",
    "the computational procedure that we use to compute the dynamical influence of the sn explosion on the binary system is outlined in appendix b. this approach allows for the possibility that the pre - sn binary is eccentric , and , for completeness , the mathematical formalism also includes the effects of the interaction between the secondary and the sn ejecta .",
    "in the majority of our simulations , we apply a single escape speed to all of the stars and binaries in question .",
    "if this escape speed is identified with the depth of the potential well at the cluster center , then the computed retention fraction will be a maximum for a given set of parameters that describes the formation and evolution of the ensemble of binaries prior to the first sn .",
    "a more realistic cluster potential and spatial distribution of stars can only result in a smaller retention fraction .",
    "the flexibility of our population synthesis code makes it straightforward to assess how a more realistic model of the cluster effects our results ( see   [ sec : real ] ) .",
    "in order to facilitate the interpretation of our detailed population synthesis calculations , it is useful to develop some quantitative insight regarding how different assumptions influence the ns retention fraction .",

    "is thought to be @xmath50 .",
    "globular clusters have a metal content that is typically @xmath154 of the solar value , and it is expected that the mass threshold for ns formation may be as low as @xmath155 , but is probably not less than @xmath156 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the imf of @xcite therefore predicts that between @xmath157 and @xmath158 of single cluster stars should be sufficiently massive to produce nss .",
    "if it is assumed that all massive stars are single , then a cluster that initially contains @xmath2 stars should produce @xmath3 nss .",
    "the situation is less clear for nss born in binary systems , owing to the effects of mass transfer .",
    "mass transfer in the case a and case @xmath85 scenarios has the effect of interrupting the growth of the core of the primary , which implies a smaller final core - mass than if the primary evolved in isolation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "consequently , the stellar mass threshold for ns formation is increased above the conventional single - star value of @xmath159 , at least for solar metallicity . if mass transfer begins at a later stage of evolution ( i.e. , after central helium - burning ) , the final core - mass has already been established ( to within @xmath148 ) and the mass threshold is basically unchanged .",
    "thus , the fraction of primordial binaries that produce ns remnants is probably somewhat less than the corresponding fraction of single stars , for the same metallicity .",
    "the actual number depends on the proportion of case a and case @xmath85 systems and on the relation between the final core - mass and the evolutionary state of the primary at the time it overflows its roche lobe .",

    ".    stable and quasi - conservative mass transfer , which is expected in a significant fraction ( depending on the value of @xmath103 ) of the case @xmath85 and case @xmath92 systems , has two notable consequences : ( i ) the secondary accretes much of the hydrogen - rich envelope of the primary , and ( ii ) the final orbital separation is typically within a factor of a few of the initial separation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : albe ] ) .",
    "the increased mass of the secondary provides a deeper gravitational potential well for the helium star , which raises the likelihood that the orbit will remain bound following the sn and hence that the ns will be retained in the cluster .",
    "the modest change in orbital separation during stable mass transfer is in sharp contrast to the dramatic shrinkage that accompanies ce evolution ( see fig . [",
    "fig : ce ] ) . for the case of small natal ns kicks , there is a clear dynamical distinction between stable and unstable mass transfer with regard to the subsequent sn explosion . as a general rule , a ns kick can be considered `` small '' if it is appreciably less than the relative orbital speed of the components ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "first , consider the case of circular pre - sn orbits and _ vanishing kicks_. if the binary is intact after the sn , retention in the cluster is determined by the new center - of - mass speed , @xmath166 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the mass @xmath170 and the orbital speed @xmath169 used above correspond to the conditions immediately before the explosion , and will generally differ from their main - sequence values as a result of mass transfer .",
    "the factor that multiplies @xmath169 can be identified as the post - sn orbital eccentricity , @xmath171 , which gives the memorable result , @xmath172 .",
    "disruption of the binary must occur if the mass lost in the explosion is more than one - half of the initial systemic mass .",
    "in this case it can be shown that the speed of the liberated ns is simply equal to @xmath169 .",
    "therefore , regardless of whether or not the binary is unbound following the sn , the relevant speed that determines if the ns is retained in a globular cluster is proportional to the pre - sn orbital speed of the primary .",
    "these arguments are made more quantitative by considering a prototypical binary with a range of initial separations .",

    "the fall - off at large separations results from the high characteristic kick speed relative to the comparatively low orbital speeds ; many of these systems are left unbound following the sn . at sufficiently small orbital separations , which correspond to high orbital speeds , the mean cm speed of the bound post - sn binaries exceeds the cluster escape speed , and thus accounts for the decreased retention fraction at small separations .",
    "the location and height of the peak depend on the helium star mass . in light of the discussion above regarding vanishing kicks ,",
    "it is clear that a more massive helium star will result in a larger dynamical perturbation to the system at the time of the sn , simply by virtue of the increased mass loss .",
    "more mass loss results in a larger fraction of the orbital speed being transformed into cm speed for a bound post - sn binary ( see eq . [ [ eq : vcm ] ] ) , and also raises the likelihood that the system will be disrupted if the characteristic kick speed is large .",
    "the combination of these effects explains the trends in fig .",
    "[ fig : est ] , namely that , for a larger helium star mass , the height of the peak is reduced and its location shifts to larger separations ( i.e. , smaller orbital speeds ) .    if we know the typical pre - sn component masses and orbital separations among the systems that undergo stable or dynamically unstable mass transfer , fig .",

    "one version applies a given distribution in kick speeds ( e.g. , a maxwellian ) and a single central escape speed . with this version of the code",
    "we are able to discern which individual evolutionary pathways contribute most to the net ns retention fraction , and we can assess in a very detailed manner the influence of varying certain parameters .",

    "we now repeat the exercise of the last section , but with the modified lorentzian kick distribution proposed by @xcite .",
    "the qualitative feature of paczyski s distribution that distinguishes it from the maxwellian is its finite value at vanishing kick speeds .",

    "in fact , for the values of @xmath30 used to generate table 4 , the retention fraction of single nss dominates over the contribution from any of the other five cases of mass transfer .",
    "figure [ fig : ret_pac ] illustrates this point clearly ; the percentage of nss retained via binary channels is never more than a factor of two over the retained percentage of nss born from isolated progenitors .      up to this point",
    "we have discussed those calculations where the nominal central escape speed has been applied to all stars and binaries in question .",
    "the combination of competitive gas accretion processes , stellar collisions , and dynamical mass segregation in the early phases of cluster development and star formation may lead to a centrally concentrated population of massive stars ( see * ? ? ?",

    "we investigate the possibility that massive stars and binaries are born within a finite spherical volume , with a gravitational potential that is appropriate for a young globular cluster .    for simplicity",

    ", it is often assumed that any star that crosses a sphere of radius @xmath237 ( the tidal radius ) is lost from the cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",

    "it is a simple matter to convolve the grid of retention fractions with both the distribution of kick speeds and the distribution of escape speeds to obtain a net retention fraction , as a function of @xmath244 and @xmath72 .",
    "we have tabulated ( table 5 ) the net retention fraction for different values of @xmath244 and @xmath72 using the maxwellian kick distribution with @xmath188 and a cluster mass of @xmath248 . for @xmath249 and @xmath250 , the percentage of ns retained in the cluster is reduced by a factor of @xmath251 below the standard model value of @xmath252 ( see table 3 ) .",
    "thus , a realistic cluster potential and finite spatial distribution of stars is indeed an important consideration .",
    "the standard model (   [ sec : stan ] ) has a very striking feature : massive secondaries ( @xmath253 ) are prevalent among the retained binaries following the first sn ( see figs . [",
    "fig : postsn ] and [ fig : postsn_scat ] ) .",
    "the majority of these massive systems have periastron separations @xmath215 , which implies that most of the secondaries will begin to transfer material to the ns at some point .",
    "furthermore , the extreme mass ratios suggest that the mass transfer will be dynamically unstable , resulting in a spiral - in of the ns into the envelope of the secondary .",
    "it should be noted that the evolution of the secondary following mass transfer may not precisely resemble the evolution of an isolated star of the same mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "before we discuss the possible outcomes of the spiral - in , we mention an important caveat . extreme accretion rates ( @xmath254 ) onto the ns  rates far exceeding the standard , radiative eddington limit of @xmath255  may be possible if the gravitational energy is lost to neutrinos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "if this `` hypercritical accretion '' occurs while the ns spirals into the envelope of a massive secondary , it is likely that the ns will collapse into a black hole , although the three - dimensional nature of the hydrodynamical problem implies that this process is very uncertain . obviously , this outcome is not desirable in regard to the retention problem , since a ns is lost if it is transformed into a black hole .",
    "we now proceed under the assumption that the ns does not undergo hypercritical accretion during the spiral - in phase ; however , the ns may still collapse to a black hole at a later stage .",
    "the envelope of the massive secondary may be successfully ejected if the circularized orbital separation is @xmath256 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this applies to only a few percent of the systems in figs .",
    "[ fig : postsn ] and [ fig : postsn_scat ] .",
    "if the envelope is ejected , and the helium core of the secondary is exposed , the formation of a second ns is possible .",
    "however , the eventual sn explosion of the helium star is likely to send the first- and second - formed nss speeding out of the cluster , even if the kick to the second ns is small and the binary remains bound after the explosion ( see   [ sec : est ] ) .",
    "the much more likely outcome among the retained ns binaries is a complete coalescence of the ns and the massive secondary , resulting in the formation of a thorne - ytkow object ( to ; thorne & ytkow 1975 , 1977 ; biehle 1991 ; cannon 1993 ; podsiadlowski , cannon , & rees 1995 ) , where hydrostatic support is provided by gravitational energy release or exotic nuclear burning processes near the surface of the ns .",
    "the ultimate fate of the ns is unclear .",
    "if the ns survives , it will probably emerge as a rapidly rotating object with the slow speed of the retained post - sn binary .",
    "however , it is possible , and perhaps likely , that the ns will collapse into a black hole during the late stage of massive to evolution @xcite .",
    "in addition to the high - mass systems in figs . [",
    "fig : postsn ] and [ fig : postsn_scat ] , roughly @xmath257 of the retained binaries have low- to intermediate - mass secondaries ( @xmath258 ) , all of which are the product of dynamically unstable mass transfer prior to the sn .",
    "mass transfer onto the ns in the circularized binary is likely to be dynamically unstable for @xmath259 @xcite , while for secondaries of lower mass the system will exist for some time as a low- or intermediate - mass x - ray binary , which may ultimately yield a millisecond radio pulsar with a very low - mass companion .",
    "the ns retention fraction calculated within our standard model is @xmath7 for nss born in binary systems .",
    "reasonable variations of the parameters that describe the primordial binary population and binary evolution during mass transfer give a retained percentage between @xmath260 and @xmath261 ( table 3 ) .",
    "if we distribute the massive binaries within a sphere of some finite radius and embed the population in a realistic background gravitational potential , the retention fraction may be reduced by a factor of @xmath262 ( table 5 ) .",
    "if we suppose that one - half of the massive stars in a young cluster are in binaries , then the retention fraction is further reduced by a factor of two .",
    "therefore , a more realistic net retention fraction is probably of order @xmath16 , when we apply the maxwellian kick distribution with @xmath188 .    as compared to the contribution from single stars , binary systems do provide a much more efficient channel for retaining nss when the characteristic kick speed is large",
    ". however , it appears the net ns retention fraction may not be sufficient to explain the abundance of nss in globular clusters .",
    "in fact , even if as many as @xmath263 nss are formed out of @xmath2 stars , our standard model , combined with the binary fraction and realistic cluster potential , predicts that only 100 nss could have been retained .",
    "it is unlikely that such a small number of nss is compatible with what is observed in certain clusters ( e.g. , 47 tuc ) .",
    "we suggest that binaries alone to not provide a robust solution to the retention problem , and we now discuss alternative hypotheses .",
    "our standard model for the formation and retention of ns in globular clusters predicts a retention fraction of @xmath7 .",
    "additional layers of realism , including a finite spatial distribution of stars embedded in a background cluster potential , and a binary fraction of massive stars , may reduce this number by more than a factor of four .",
    "we suggest that our standard model requires significant modification in order for the results to be consistent with observations . here",
    ", we briefly speculate on possible alternative solutions to the retention problem .",
    "a very simple `` fix '' to the retention problem is to assume that the true underlying distribution in ns kicks has a much lower mean speed than the galactic pulsars suggest .",
    "such a distribution would require a substantial number of slowly - moving pulsars , which , for some reason , have not yet been detected .",
    "maybe the pulsar sample is too small , or perhaps some systematic effect is unaccounted for in studies of pulsar kinematics , or both .",
    "a complete consistency check is difficult , if not impossible , and must incorporate all of the uncertain theory of single star and binary stellar evolution .",
    "in addition , we require some rudimentary understanding of the physical mechanism that produces the largest ns kicks .",
    "one possibility is that small kicks preferentially occur in binary systems , in which case the associated ns is likely to remain bound to its companion following the sn and thus will not appear as an isolated pulsar .",
    "recently , a new class of high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) has emerged .",
    "these systems exhibit relatively low eccentricities ( @xmath47 ) and orbital periods sufficiently long ( @xmath264 ) that tidal circularization could not have played a significant role . a detailed analysis of one such system ( x per/4u 0352 + 30 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) revealed that the observed orbit is entirely consistent with the ns having been born with no kick whatsoever .",
    "table 6 lists names and orbital parameters of systems that belong to the class of wide , nearly circular hmxbs .",
    "it is interesting to note that the present orbit of xte j1543 - 568 @xcite is not precisely consistent with both zero kick and a perfectly circular pre - sn orbit ; the eccentricity is too small by a factor of @xmath265 .",
    "one or the other assumption must be relaxed . if we demand that the pre - sn orbit was circular , then it is straightforward to show that a very small kick of @xmath266 is required to produce the observed eccentricity , and that the direction of the kick does not have to be finely tuned .",
    "with some perspective , we can motivate a phenomenological picture that accounts for the population of wide , nearly circular hmxbs , and which is consistent with what we know about the galactic ns population .",
    "our model must satisfy three basic constraints .",
    "first , the systems listed in table 6 are quite wide and thus have not experienced the dramatic orbital shrinkage associated with dynamically unstable mass transfer ; the mass transfer in these systems was likely in accord with the stable case @xmath85 or @xmath92 scenario described in   [ sec : mtover ] .",
    "we propose that a significant fraction of those nss whose progenitors underwent case @xmath85 or @xmath92 mass transfer received only a small kick ( e.g. , @xmath10 ) .",
    "second , the model should be able to approximately reproduce the numbers and properties of the observed population of bright low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) in the galaxy .",
    "third , our basic picture should also be consistent with the observed kinematical distribution of isolated pulsars in the galaxy , on which the ns kick distributions are based .",
    "these latter two constraints are satisfied if we suppose that a ns received the usual large kick if its progenitor was allowed to evolve into a red supergiant ( i.e. , a single progenitor or case @xmath86 , @xmath90 , or d for a binary system ) .",
    "the standard formation channel for lmxbs involves a common - envelope phase in the case @xmath86 or @xmath90 scenario ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and so the nss in these systems would have received the conventional large kicks by our hypothesis . also ,",
    "within this framework , isolated , fast - moving pulsars are likely to have come from single progenitors or wide binaries that were disrupted owing to the sn .",
    "we repeated the retention study with the following assumptions regarding ns kicks .",
    "if the orbit of the primordial binary is sufficiently wide that mass transfer begins when the star is a red supergiant ( i.e. , case @xmath86 , @xmath90 , or d ) , the ns kick is chosen from a maxwellian distribution with @xmath188 , as in the standard model ( see   [ sec : stan ] ) . however ,",
    "if the mass transfer is stable and case @xmath85 or @xmath92 , we utilize a maxwellian kick distribution with @xmath267 . using the standard - model parameters given in table 3 , model 5 ,",
    "we calculate a net retention fraction contributed by binary channels of @xmath163 .",
    "therefore , we see that the above scenario greatly reduces the severity of the retention problem .",
    "figure [ fig : postsn_hmxb ] shows the distributions in orbital parameters and speeds for the retained ns binaries . on average , the systems in fig .",
    "[ fig : postsn_hmxb ] are wider , more circular , and are moving more slowly than the systems in fig .",
    "[ fig : postsn ] , which shows the same distributions , but for the standard model .",
    "there is a plausible physical argument that may support the empirically - motivated phenomenological hypothesis outlined above .",
    "young , isolated , massive stars are observed to rotate at @xmath268 of their breakup rates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . during the hydrogen - burning main sequence , the structure of the star changes sufficiently slowly that various hydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamical processes should be effective in enforcing nearly uniform rotation throughout much of the star @xcite",
    "immediately following the depletion of hydrogen in the core , the structure of the star changes dramatically ; the envelope expands to giant dimensions on a thermal timescale ( @xmath269 ) and the core contracts while conserving angular momentum .",
    "if the helium core is exposed during this rapid expansion phase as a result of mass transfer in a binary system ( case @xmath85 or possibly @xmath92 ; see figs .",
    "[ fig : radev10 ] and [ fig : radev15 ] ) , the nascent helium star is likely to be rapidly rotating . on the other hand ,",
    "if the star is allowed to evolve into a red supergiant , maxwell stresses may strongly couple the mostly convective and very slowly rotating envelope to the core , causing the core to spin down to the angular velocity of the envelope @xcite .",
    "this argument suggests a possible dichotomy in core - collapse dynamics between isolated stars and some stars born in close binary systems",
    ". it may be that a helium core exposed following case @xmath85 or @xmath92 mass transfer is rotating much faster than the core of an isolated star at a late stage of its evolution .",
    "dynamically , the collapse of a rapidly rotating core is certainly more phenomenologically complex than the collapse of an initially static core .",
    "however , it is not obvious a priori whether a rapidly rotating or slowly rotating core should ultimately yield a larger average natal kick to the ns .",
    "perhaps the rotation axis provides a preferred direction for the escape of neutrinos or the formation of jets and the ns receives a kick perpendicular to the orbital plane .",
    "another possibility is that rapid rotation stalls the collapse somewhat ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , allowing many rotations before the ns is formed .",
    "a large number of rotations of the collapsing core may have the effect of averaging out the asymmetries that give rise to large ns kicks @xcite . these speculations aside , we are motivated by empirical evidence to suggest that helium stars exposed following stable case @xmath85 or ( possibly ) @xmath92 mass transfer produce nss with small natal kicks , while nss formed following mass transfer at a later stage of evolution may receive the conventional large kicks .      thus far , we have considered only massive stellar progenitors of nss .",
    "however , if the mass of a white dwarf can be increased to the critical chandrasekhar value ( @xmath270 ) , the white dwarf may collapse to form a ns .",
    "this _ accretion - induced collapse _ ( aic ) scenario was proposed by grindlay ( 1987 ; see also bailyn & grindlay 1990 ) in the context of globular clusters to explain a number of things regarding cluster ns populations , the retention problem among them .",
    "two fundamentally different scenarios have been proposed for the formation of a ns via aic , which we now discuss in turn .",
    "a white dwarf may be `` grown '' to the chandrasekhar mass by the slow accumulation of material accreted from a stellar companion . in this scenario , if the white dwarf has a c / o composition it is more likely to explode in a type ia sn , than to collapse to form a neutron star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more favorable candidates for aic are white dwarfs with an o / ne / mg composition ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these are relatively rare white dwarfs with masses above @xmath271 .",
    "to grow the white dwarf to the chandrasekhar mass , however , requires some fine tuning in the accretion rate , which must lie in the relatively narrow range of about @xmath272 @xcite . for significantly lower accretion rates ,",
    "the burning of hydrogen to helium is likely to be unstable , leading to hydrodynamical nova explosions , which may eject at least as much mass as was accreted ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for larger transfer rates the white dwarf atmosphere will tend to swell to giant dimensions and may overflow its roche lobe , thereby losing much of the accreted matter .",
    "perhaps the most promising cases for obtaining mass transfer rates within the above narrow range occur for thermal timescale mass transfer via the roche lobe overflow in binaries with relatively unevolved companions in the mass range @xmath273 ( e.g. , supersoft x - ray sources ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another possibility occurs for the case of accretion from the strong stellar wind of a low - mass giant @xcite .",
    "a second possible aic channel involves the coalescence of two white dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "two white dwarfs in a close binary system will be drawn together as gravitational radiation removes orbital angular momentum .",
    "the negative mass - radius exponent of a white dwarf implies that the less massive component will first fill its roche lobe . like the standard aic scenario , which involves only one white dwarf ,",
    "the double white dwarf merger model has been proposed as an evolutionary pathway to the formation of type ia sne ( e.g. , iben & tutukov 1984 ; webbink 1984 ; saffer , livio , & yungelson 1998 , and references therein ) ; however , it is now considered more likely that this will lead to disruption of the lighter white dwarf ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . under the assumption that the merger does not produce a type ia sn , in order for the double white dwarf system to ultimately yield a ns , the sum of the masses must exceed the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "approximately 1 out of every 1000 primordial binaries should produce such a massive double white dwarf close enough to merge within a hubble time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if a sizable fraction of these systems can collapse to form a ns , rather than explode as a type ia sn , then perhaps as many as 1000 nss can be formed in this way in a globular cluster . however , binary population synthesis in a globular cluster is substantially more complex than in the galactic plane , owing to the dynamical interactions among binaries and single stars .",
    "we have not attempted to follow any of these channels in this work .",
    "this would certainly be a worthwhile future study to help quantify the formation rates of nss via aic in both globular clusters and in the galactic plane .",
    "finally , we note that there is no obvious reason why a ns formed via aic would be less subject to the same type of accelerations as those formed from collapsed cores of massive stars , especially if the ns velocities are acquired as a result of asymmetric neutrino emission or the post - natal electromagnetic rocket mechanism ( harrison & tademaru 1975 ; see also lai , chernoff , & cordes 2001 ) .",
    "tidal stripping of globular clusters is a theoretically well - studied phenomenon ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it has been shown ( see joshi , nave , & rasio for a recent discussion ) that , for a range in parameters that describe the initial cluster equilibrium model , a cluster may disrupt in the tidal field of the galaxy in less than @xmath274 , owing to the combined effects of mass loss during stellar evolution and the diffusion of stars across the cluster s tidal boundary ( effectively , its roche lobe ) .",
    "the survivability of a cluster depends on its location in the galaxy , its central concentration , and on the shape of the cluster imf ( in particular , the slope of the imf above @xmath275 ) .",
    "clusters with a high central concentration and a small proportion of massive stars are more likely to survive to core collapse , although as much as @xmath276 of the initial mass of the cluster may be lost before this phase is reached @xcite .",
    "the idea that a cluster may lose a very significant fraction of its mass , but still `` survive '' in some sense , brings to light the interesting and very real possibility that some of the globular clusters that presently have a mass of @xmath277 are , in fact , remnants of clusters with an initial mass in stars of @xmath278 .",
    "at least one such supermassive cluster has been discovered in the andromeda galaxy @xcite , and it has been speculated that this cluster is actually the core of a dwarf elliptical galaxy . for a cluster of initial mass @xmath279 , a net ns retention fraction of a few percent , along with a standard imf , implies possibly a thousand nss at the current epoch , which may be sufficient to explain the present pulsar and x - ray binary populations in globular clusters .",

    "<S> the mass transfer may be stable or dynamically unstable , depending on the structure of the mass donor and the mass ratio of the components . </S>",
    "<S> dynamically unstable mass transfer leads to a common - envelope phase and a dramatic reduction in the orbital separation , while a modest change in separation is expected if the transfer is stable . in either case </S>",

    "<S> it is assumed that the entire hydrogen - rich envelope of the initially more massive star is removed in the mass transfer episode , exposing the star s helium core . </S>",
