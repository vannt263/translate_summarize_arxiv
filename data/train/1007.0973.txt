    "we are interested in an active imager , such as a laser radar , comprised of a transmitter and a receiver in which we control the object illumination and form the image with the receiver . for such systems ,",
    "the spatial resolution is a function of two antenna patterns , viz .",
    ", the transmitter s illumination pattern on the object _ and  the receiver antenna pattern , set by the diffraction limit of its optics , projected onto the object .",
    "when floodlight illumination is employed , so that the entire object is bathed in light , the resolution limit is set by the receiver s rayleigh diffraction bound . if the transmitter and receiver are co - located , they can share the same optics so that their antenna patterns have identical rayleigh bounds whose product gives the overall resolution behavior .",
    "alternatively , if a small transmitter is located much closer to the object than is the receiver , it is possible to project very small spots onto the object to be imaged .",
    "if this is done in a precision scan , so that the receiver knows exactly where the transmitter is pointing at any instant in time , a simple energy measurement at the receiver will realize resolution limited by the transmitter s antenna pattern , regardless of the receiver s own rayleigh bound .",
    "however , creating that precision scan , and relaying the scan positions to the receiver , could easily be a major challenge , especially if the transmitter is mounted on a small unmanned air vehicle .",
    "the postselection technique of giovannetti _",
    "et al.circumvents that problem by allowing the scan pattern to be arbitrary , even random , so long as the object s region of interest is covered .",
    "_ _    suppose that a focused transmitter emits a @xmath4-going , quasimonochromatic , paraxial , linearly - polarized laser pulse with scalar complex envelope @xmath5 for @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the transverse coordinate vector , @xmath8 is the transmitter aim angle , and @xmath9 is the wave number at the center wavelength @xmath10 .",
    "we will normalize @xmath11 to have units @xmath12 , and take the pulse shape @xmath13 to satisfy @xmath14 , so that @xmath15 is the average transmitted photon number @xcite .",
    "this pulse transilluminates an object @xmath16-m away from the transmitter @xcite .",
    "the light that passes through the object is then collected by a diffraction - limited circular lens of diameter @xmath17 located @xmath18-m in front of the object .",
    "the focal length of this lens is such that it casts an image of the object at a distance @xmath19 beyond the lens . neglecting the propagation delay and correcting for image inversion , the photon - flux density in the image plane is then @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the object s field - transmission function",
    ", @xmath22 is the image magnification @xcite , and we see the transmitter and receiver s circular - pupil antenna patterns .    to exhibit the sub - rayleigh resolution capability of the scheme from @xcite we shall assume that : ( 1 ) the transmitter s antenna pattern fully resolves all significant features in @xmath21 @xcite ; ( 2 ) the image - plane photon counting array has pixels of area @xmath23 sufficiently small that diffraction , rather than pixel size , limits image resolution ; and ( 3 ) the photon counting array outputs pixel counts taken over the full @xmath3-s - long extent of @xmath13 . for a given illumination angle @xmath24 , the pixel counts are then statistically independent , poisson random variables with mean value , for the pixel centered at @xmath25 , given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the detector s quantum efficiency . if photon counts are collected from the pixel at @xmath25 while @xmath24 is randomly scanned over the object region , the unconditional probability of getting @xmath0 counts from that pixel is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the scan pattern s probability density function . postselecting those pixels",
    "for which @xmath0 counts have been registered , we get an image @xmath30 . for @xmath31 ,",
    "the poisson distribution is monotonically decreasing with increasing @xmath0 , whence @xmath32 where we have suppressed multiplicative constants and ignored the exponential term as it is independent of @xmath0 . here",
    "we see that the postselected image contains @xmath33 convolved with the @xmath0th power of the receiver s airy disk pattern , i.e. , a point - spread function that is @xmath1@xmath2 narrower than the airy disk itself when compared on a main - lobe area basis @xcite .",
    "note that violating the preceding monotonicity condition can lead to the `` donut - hole '' effect exhibited in the experiments described below .",
    "we demonstrate the concept of sub - rayleigh imaging with the setup shown in fig .  [",
    "f : setup](a ) .",
    "the object to be imaged in transmission was part of a u.s .",
    "air force ( usaf ) resolution target consisting of alternate opaque and clear stripes of width 125@xmath34 m ( 4 line pairs / mm ) , as indicated by the arrow in fig .",
    "[ f : image](a ) .",
    "a 532-nm laser was mounted on an @xmath35 translation stage that provided scan coverage over the entire object with a 20-@xmath34m - radius focused spot .",
    "we imaged the object through a @xmath36 = 25-cm diffraction - limited lens set in a 2-mm - diameter aperture .",
    "the optics provided 5.3@xmath37 image magnification , yielding a 660-@xmath34m - wide strip at the image plane . under conventional ( entire - object ) illumination , shown in the setup of fig .",
    "[ f : setup](b ) , the rayleigh diffraction bound for the imaging system at the image plane was 1.86 mm , which is @xmath12.8@xmath37 larger than the stripe width . figure  [ f : image](b ) shows the conventional - illumination image that was obtained using standard photodetection ( with all events counted ) : the stripes are unresolved , as expected .",
    "note that with full illumination of the object , we were not able to go beyond the rayleigh bound even with the @xmath0-photon detection scheme , indicating that focused illumination is a necessary requirement .",
    "the detector was a compact @xmath38 si single - photon avalanche diode ( spad ) array fabricated with a complementary metal oxide semiconductor ( cmos ) process @xcite .",
    "the si spad was a @xmath39-@xmath40 junction reverse - biased above its breakdown voltage and operated in the geiger mode with a detection efficiency of @xmath130% at 532 nm .",
    "each pixel of the cmos spad array consisted of one spad with its front - end active quenching and resetting electronics and a digital counting circuitry for in - pixel pre - processing . the pixel pitch for the array was 100@xmath34 m , and the spad had a fill factor of only 3.1% at each pixel due to the presence of on - chip electronics . owing to the large separation between spads",
    "we did not observe any cross talk .",
    "the average pixel dead time ( including all the electronic circuitry ) was 300ns .",
    "each spad delivered a digital output pulse for every single - photon detection event with no readout noise .",
    "the in - pixel counting circuitry would compute the number of single - photon events within its user - selectable integration time of 1@xmath34s or more and store the tally in an in - pixel memory cell . by measuring incident photons over a long integration time ,",
    "@xmath0-photon sensitivity in the time domain can be achieved at the single - pixel level .",
    "the array readout was performed through an 8-bit data bus without interrupting the next 1024-pixel frame of photon - counting integration , and the maximum frame rate was @xmath41/s .",
    "a typical integration time of each frame was tens of @xmath34s .      to implement sub - rayleigh imaging in fig .",
    "[ f : setup](a ) we manually scanned the focused beam in a random pattern , making sure that there was coverage for the entire area of interest . at each scan location",
    ", we recorded over 8000 measurement frames for image averaging that took less than 1 second to accomplish .",
    "the incident power was adjusted to have an average peak photocount @xmath42 = 14 per integration time ( for one pixel ) . for each measurement frame , each pixel with exactly @xmath0 photocounts ( after dark - count subtraction , measured separately ) was tagged as having an @xmath0-photon event .",
    "all other pixels were then tagged for zero @xmath0-photon events .",
    "the measurement process was then repeated at a different scan location until the object of interest was fully scanned .",
    "figure  [ f : image](c ) shows the resultant image for @xmath0 = 23 , revealing the three stripes that were lost under conventional illumination in fig .",
    "[ f : image](b ) .",
    "the color scale of fig .",
    "[ f : image](c ) has a large range to accommodate several pixels with very high event counts and therefore image details ( with lower event frequencies ) are obscured .",
    "figure  [ f : image](d ) shows the 3-d intensity profile of the same @xmath43 image of fig .",
    "[ f : image](c ) , except that we cap the event occurrence at 800 for pixels with over 800 events in order to make the lower - count pixels more visible , thus revealing the three stripes very clearly .",
    "according to theory , the expected enhancement of @xmath2 should yield a sub - rayleigh resolution of @xmath11.86/@xmath44 = 0.4 mm is qualitatively borne out by our results .",
    "note that the sub - rayleigh resolution still exceeds the 106-@xmath34m - limit set ( after magnification ) by the focused illumination at the object , as expected .",
    "we chose @xmath43 to be substantially larger than @xmath42 = 14 to avoid the  donut - hole \" problem . to illustrate this issue , fig .",
    "[ f : pointsource ] shows images of a point source obtained under various measurement conditions .",
    "the aperture diameter of the imaging optics in fig .",
    "[ f : setup](a ) was set to 3 mm with the same overall image magnification of 5.3 so that the rayleigh bound at the image plane ( spad array ) was 1.2 mm .",
    "we removed the usaf resolution target so that the 20-@xmath34m - radius focused spot at the object plane served as the point source , and no scanning was necessary for these images .",
    "we took @xmath132,000 measurement frames , recorded the photocounts at each pixel for each frame , binned them accordingly after subtracting dark counts , and processed the data .",
    "figure  [ f : pointsource](a ) shows the cross section of the rayleigh - bound image of the point source through the 3-mm - diameter aperture obtained by including all photocounts to yield an intensity profile averaged over the @xmath132000 frames .",
    "we measured @xmath45 and , as an indicator for the image size , we obtained the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath11 mm .",
    "figures  [ f : pointsource](b)(d ) are cross - sectional profiles obtained by selecting exactly @xmath0-photocounts for @xmath46 9 , 15 , and 23 , that are respectively smaller than , equal to , and greater than @xmath42 . for @xmath47 in ( b ) , the center portion of the point - source image usually received more than the threshold level @xmath0 and therefore had few exactly @xmath0-photon events . on the other hand , the photocounts away from the center decrease from @xmath42 until the photocount average matches the threshold @xmath0 where it shows a peak , and hence the image has a  donut - hole \" shape @xcite . for @xmath48 in ( c ) ,",
    "the profile is single - peaked and looks slightly narrower and steeper than the rayleigh - bound image in fig .",
    "[ f : pointsource](a ) which is much larger than the magnified size of the focused beam of 125 @xmath34 m ( fwhm ) at the image plane .",
    "when @xmath49 , as required for sub - rayleigh imaging , we observe in ( d ) that the profile for @xmath0 = 23 shows a much narrower peak with a fwhm width of @xmath10.4 mm that is smaller than the 1-mm width ( fwhm ) of the rayleigh - bound point source image in fig .",
    "[ f : pointsource](a ) .",
    "we also note that the @xmath0 = 23 event frequency is much lower than for @xmath0 less than or equal to @xmath42 , because such a large @xmath0 did not happen very often .",
    "our sub - rayleigh imaging has characteristics that are similar to @xmath0-photon interferometry , in which sub - wavelength ( @xmath50 ) interference patterns were obtained with coherent - state input and postselective @xmath0-photon detection @xcite .",
    "our point - source images suggest the following physical origin for the formation of the rayleigh diffraction bound and the basis for our sub - rayleigh imaging technique .",
    "the donut holes that form for @xmath47 are responsible for the diffractive spread of the imaging system . by removing the low-@xmath0 photocount events and those comparable to @xmath42 , one captures the much narrower profile for @xmath49 at the expense of longer acquisition times due to less frequent occurrences for high values of @xmath0 .",
    "we should also achieve similar results if we relax the measurement requirement from exactly @xmath0 for @xmath49 to a sum of all @xmath49 , whose resolution should be dominated by its lowest @xmath0 term due to its larger sub - rayleigh width ( @xmath51 ) and higher rate of occurrence .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated sub - rayleigh imaging resolution using a classical light source , tight focusing on the object , and @xmath0-photon photodetection .",
    "the sub - rayleigh technique removes the low-@xmath0 image components that contribute to the diffractive spread of the imaging system .",
    "the measured resolution enhancement of @xmath1@xmath2 is in good agreement with theory .",
    "the sub - rayleigh technique may find applications in which active illumination can be implemented to obtain a higher resolution image at the expense of longer acquisition times .",
