    "in diffractive interactions in hadron - hadron or photon - hadron collisions at least one of the beam particles emerges intact from the collision , having lost only a small fraction of its initial energy , and carrying a small transverse momentum .",
    "such interactions are described by the exchange of an object with vacuum quantum numbers , referred to as the pomeron in the framework of regge phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "similar reactions can also proceed when quantum numbers are exchanged through subleading reggeon and pion trajectories ; however , these contributions are negligible at small values of the energy loss .",
    "significant progress has been made in understanding diffraction in terms of quantum chromo - dynamics by studying the diffractive dissociation of virtual photons , @xmath0 , in deep inelastic @xmath3 scattering ( dis ) at hera ( for a review see  @xcite ) . in this process",
    ", a photon of virtuality @xmath4 diffractively dissociates interacting with the proton at a centre - of - mass energy @xmath5 and produces the hadronic system @xmath1 with mass @xmath2 . the fraction of the proton s momentum carried by the exchanged object is denoted by @xmath6 , while the fraction of the momentum of the exchanged object carried by the struck quark is denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "experimentally , diffractive @xmath3 scattering is characterised by the presence of a leading proton in the final state carrying most of the proton beam energy and , consequently , by a lack of hadronic activity in the forward ( proton ) direction .",
    "conservation of momentum implies that the system @xmath1 must have a small mass with respect to the photon - proton centre - of - mass energy , since @xmath8 .",
    "these signatures have been widely exploited at hera to select diffractive events by tagging the foward proton ( proton - tagging method  @xcite ) , by requiring the presence of a large gap in the forward rapidity distribution of particles ( lrg method  @xcite ) or by exploting the shape of the @xmath2 distribution , different in diffractive and non - diffractive events ( @xmath2 method  @xcite ) .",
    "a thorough comparison of these three selection methods has recently been carried out on a set of data collected with the zeus detector in the years 1999 and 2000  @xcite , when the detector was still equipped with the leading proton spectrometer ( lps ) .",
    "the different methods access different kinematic regions and are subject to different systematic uncertainties : in the lrg and @xmath2 methods , high @xmath2 values are not accessible since the non - diffractive background grows with @xmath2 and the rapidity gap moves more and more forward ( and is eventually confined to the beam pipe ) .",
    "moreover , the measured cross section includes a contribution from events of the type @xmath9 , in which the proton also dissociates into a state @xmath10 with low - mass @xmath11 , separated from @xmath1 by a rapidity gap .",
    "the statistical precision of the results is good because of the high acceptance of the central detector .",
    "conversely , low-@xmath6 samples selected by the proton - tagging method have little or no background from proton - dissociative events or from non - diffractive dis and allow access to higher values of @xmath2 . however , the statistical precision is poor because of the small acceptance of the proton taggers ",
    "approximately 2% at low @xmath6 in the lps case .",
    "in order to compare the reduced cross sections measured with the three methods , the different @xmath6 and @xmath11 coverages of the various samples have to be taken into account :    * the lps data extend up to @xmath6 of 0.1 and therefore include contributions from reggeon and pion trajectories ; the lrg sample is restricted to the region @xmath12 and thus mainly consists of diffractive events ; in the @xmath2 sample , the statistical subtraction of the non - diffractive events has been shown  @xcite to suppress the reggeon contribution ; * in the lps results , @xmath11 coincides with the protons mass , @xmath13 ; the lrg data are also corrected to @xmath14 ; the @xmath2 results are corrected to @xmath15 gev .    the amount of proton - dissociation background and the corresponding corrections were found to be the most crucial issue in the comparison and are therefore discussed in detail in the following .      the proton - dissociative system can either escape entirely undetected in the forward beam - pipe or leak partially into the detector acceptance and therefore be measured by the forward detectors ( forward plug calorimeter , fpc , and main calorimeter , cal ) . in the former case ,",
    "the background events are included in the measured cross section , of which they bias the normalisation . in the latter case , they are or are not rejected depending on the specific analysis cuts .    in the lps analysis the contribution from proton - dissociative events was studied with the pythia monte carlo ( mc ) and was found around 9% at @xmath16 , decreasing rapidly with decreasing @xmath6 . in the region @xmath17 this background is negligible . at low @xmath6 the ratio of the lrg and @xmath2 results to the lps ones",
    "can thus be used to quantify the total fraction of proton - dissociative events included in these samples .    in the lrg analysis the contribution from proton - dissociative events was also estimated with pythia .",
    "two proton - dissociative samples were selected , one with the fpc and one with the lps , the combination of which covers nearly the whole @xmath11 spectrum , including the lowest @xmath11 values .",
    "the generated pythia distributions for @xmath11 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 were reweighted to describe these samples , in particular the energy distribution in the fpc and the @xmath18 distribution in the lps .",
    "the average of the fpc and lps estimates provided a measurement of the proton - dissociative contribution to the lrg results of @xmath19 .    in the @xmath2 method the diffractive contribution is extracted as the observed number of events after subtracting the non - diffractive component from a fit to the @xmath20 distribution .",
    "proton - dissociative events measurable in the forward detectors lead to a reconstructed @xmath2 value higher than the actual photon - dissociative mass , hence to a distortion of the @xmath20 spectrum and , consequently , of the extracted diffractive signal . the role and the treatment of the proton - dissociation background",
    "is thus much more critical than in the lrg analysis : before the statistical subtraction of the non - diffractive background , all events need to be subtracted from the data which , according to a proton - dissociative mc , deposit anything measurable in the forward detectors .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that , on average , events with masses @xmath15 gev can not be detected .",
    "the sang mc was used to subtract events with @xmath21 gev from the data . to avoid the reggeon exchange region sang , like most of the proton - dissociative mcs , is generated with an upper @xmath11 cut , @xmath22 . hence , bin - by - bin the amount of subtracted events with @xmath21 gev depended on @xmath5 . on the contrary",
    ", monte carlo studies showed that in the lrg case the rapidity gap requirement eliminates the @xmath11 tail ; the correction becomes therefore independent of kinematics , as discussed in next section and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] .",
    "r0.45        the results obtained with the three methods were compared in bins of @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath6 in terms of the diffractive reduced cross section , @xmath23 .",
    "the latter coincides with the diffractive structure function , @xmath24 , if the ratio of the cross sections for longitudinally and transversely polarised virtual photons can be neglected .",
    "the three samples are only weakly correlated through systematics but statistically not independent : the lrg and @xmath2 data overlap by about 75% ; 0.7% of the lrg events have a proton measured in the lps and 35% of the lps events are also contained in the lrg sample .    the ratio of @xmath23 , extracted from the lps and lrg data , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] , is @xmath25 ; the last uncertainty reflects the normalisation uncertainty of the lps data , mostly related to the @xmath26 uncertainty due to the proton - beam optics . the ratio is independent of @xmath4 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , indicating that the two methods lead to compatible results for @xmath27 .",
    "it also confirms that contributions from proton - dissociative events in the lrg measurement do not significantly alter the @xmath4 , @xmath6 or @xmath7 dependences .",
    "the ratio translates into a proton - dissociative background fraction of @xmath28% .",
    "the agreement between this number and the result of the mc study discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : pdiss ] lends support to the present estimate of the proton- dissociation contamination in the lrg analysis .",
    "cross section measurements obtained with the lrg and @xmath2 methods are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp_mx ] , where also the previous @xmath2-method results  @xcite are shown .",
    "the lrg data were corrected to @xmath29 by statistical subtraction of the background estimated in sec .  [ sec : pdiss ] .",
    "the @xmath2 results were normalised to the lrg data with a scaling factor of 0.83 @xmath30 0.04 , obtained from a global fit ; this factor quantifies the amount of residual proton - dissociative background in the @xmath2 data due to masses below @xmath31 gev .",
    "the overall agreement between the two measurements is satisfactory .",
    "the different @xmath6 dependence for @xmath32 , more evident at low @xmath4 , may be ascribed to the fact that in the @xmath2 results the contribution of reggeon and pion trajectories is suppressed . in the low-@xmath4 region ,",
    "the @xmath4 behaviour is slightly different in the two data sets , with the @xmath2-method results decreasing faster with @xmath4 than the lrg results .",
