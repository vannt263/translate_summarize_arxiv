    "multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) radar has received considerable recent attention @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a mimo radar consists of multiple transmit and receive antennas and is advantageous in two different scenarios @xcite-@xcite , namely , widely separated antennas and collocated antennas . in the first scenario @xcite",
    ", the transmit antennas are located far apart from each other relative to their distance to the target .",
    "the mimo radar system transmits independent probing signals from its antennas that follow independent paths , and thus each target return carries independent information about the target .",
    "joint processing of the target returns results in diversity gain , which enables the mimo radar to achieve high target resolution .",
    "widely distributed mimo radar systems are shown to offer considerable advantages for estimation of target parameters , such as location @xcite and velocity @xcite . in the collocated scenario @xcite@xcite ,",
    "the transmit and receive antennas are located close to each other relative to the target , so that all antennas view the same aspect of the target . in this scenario ,",
    "the phase differences induced by transmit and receive antennas can be exploited to form a long virtual array with the number of elements equal to the product of the numbers of transmit and receive nodes .",
    "this enables the mimo radar to achieve superior resolution in terms of direction of arrival ( doa ) estimation and parameter identification @xcite .",
    "compressive sensing ( cs ) theory @xcite-@xcite states that a signal @xmath1 that exhibits sparsity in some domain , can be recovered from a number of samples that is much smaller than that required by nyquist theory . in particular , a signal of length @xmath2 that can be represented by @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) basis vectors in some space , can be recovered exactly with high probability from @xmath5 measurements .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the basis matrix that spans that space , and @xmath7 denote an @xmath8 matrix with @xmath9 , that is incoherent with @xmath6 and is referred to as the measurement matrix .",
    "the recovery proceeds by finding the coefficients of the @xmath3 basis vectors in the signal decomposition .",
    "this is formulated as an @xmath0-optimization problem , i.e. , @xmath10 throughput this paper , we will refer to recovery along these lines as the _",
    "cs approach_. the product @xmath11 is usually referred to as the _ sensing matrix_. according to the uniform uncertainty principle ( uup ) @xcite-@xcite , if every set of sensing matrix columns with cardinality less than the sparsity of the signal of interest is approximately orthogonal , then the sparse signal can be exactly recovered with high probability . in other words , cs recovery requires that @xmath7 is incoherent with @xmath6 . for an orthonormal basis matrix , use of a random measurement matrix",
    "leads to a sensing matrix that obeys the uup with overwhelming probability @xcite .",
    "the entries of such a measurement matrix can be taken from a gaussian distribution or symmetric bernoulli distribution .",
    "the rows of a fourier matrix or an orthonormal matrix could also compose a measurement matrix . in this paper , we term as _ the conventional approach _",
    "cs recovery using a gaussian measurement matrix .",
    "the application of cs to radar and mimo radar has been explored in @xcite-@xcite and @xcite-@xcite , respectively . in both @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the authors considered a uniform linear array as a transmit and receive antenna configuration and proposed to use a submatrix of the identity matrix as the measurement matrix . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "a cs - based mimo radar system implemented on a small scale network was proposed .",
    "the network consists of a number of transmit and receive nodes , each equipped with a single antenna , that are randomly distributed over a small area .",
    "each transmit node transmits a different narrowband signal .",
    "if the number of targets is small , the signal that is reflected by targets and is picked up at a receive node is sparse in the angle - range - doppler space .",
    "this fact can be exploited to achieve target detection and localization using only a small number of compressively obtained samples at each receive node , and/or by involving a small number of receive nodes @xcite .",
    "the approach of @xcite and @xcite was applied to the case in which the targets are located within a small range bin and the sampling is synchronized with the first target return . to improve performance in the presence of strong interference",
    "the columns of the sensing matrix were designed to incorporate information on the transmit waveforms .    in this paper , we consider a general scenario that does not confine the targets within a small range bin , nor does it require sampling synchronization . when the targets are separated by several range bins , different targets will introduce different delays in the received waveforms .",
    "in that case , the formulation of @xcite and @xcite no longer applies .",
    "this problem was considered in @xcite , where a step - frequency approach was proposed in order to improve range resolution . here , our goal is optimal or suboptimal measurement matrix design that decreases the coherence of the sensing matrix ( csm ) and/or enhances signal - to - interference ratio ( sir ) .",
    "the first design minimizes a performance penalty that is a linear combination of csm and the inverse sir .",
    "the measurement matrix is obtained by solving a convex optimization problem that involves high computational complexity .",
    "a suboptimal solution is also proposed that forces a specific structure to the measurement matrix .",
    "the second design targets only sir improvement ; it is constructed based on the transmit signal waveforms and accounts for all possible discretized delays of target returns within a given time window .",
    "it is shown that depending on the waveforms used , the latter measurement matrix can significantly improve sir while it results in csm comparable to that of the random gaussian measurement matrix .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we provide the signal model of a cs - based mimo radar system with targets falling in different range bins . in section iii",
    ", we introduce the two proposed measurement matrices and provide the sir analysis related to the second measurement matrix .",
    "simulation results are given in section iv for stationary targets .",
    "finally , we make some concluding remarks in section v.    _ notation _ : lower case and capital letters in bold denote respectively vectors and matrices .",
    "the expectation of a random variable is denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "superscripts @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote respectively the hermitian transpose and trace of a matrix .",
    "@xmath15 represents the @xmath16-th entry of the matrix @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 denotes an @xmath19 matrix with zero entries .",
    "let us consider a mimo radar system consisting of @xmath20 transmit antennas ( txs ) and @xmath21 receive antennas ( rxs ) that are randomly distributed over a small area ( colocated ) .",
    "each tx node transmits periodic narrowband pulses of duration @xmath22 and pulse repetition interval ( pri ) @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath24/@xmath25 denote the location of the @xmath26-th transmit / receive node in polar coordinates .",
    "let us also consider the presence of @xmath3 slowly - moving point targets located in different range bins ; the @xmath27-th target is at azimuth angle @xmath28 and moves with constant radial speed @xmath29",
    ".    let @xmath30 denote the range of the @xmath27-th target at time @xmath31 . under the far - field assumption ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath32 , the distance between the @xmath26th transmit / receive node and the @xmath27-th target @xmath33/@xmath34 can be approximated as @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "let us consider the return from the @xmath27-th target arriving at the @xmath37-th antenna during the @xmath38-th pulse , i.e. , @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 denotes the speed of light , the carrier frequency , and the reflection coefficient of the @xmath27-th target , respectively ; @xmath43 represents the transmit waveform of the @xmath26-th node . under the narrowband assumption , and due to the slow target speed",
    "so that the doppler shift is negligible , the baseband signal corresponding to ( [ rec_sig_1 ] ) becomes @xmath44 due to the closeness of the transmit and receive nodes , the distances between nodes and the target are approximately the same for all receivers .",
    "thus , the time delay in the waveforms , induced by the @xmath27-th target can be approximately based on the range corresponding to the initial sampling time , i.e. , @xmath45 , which is independent of the rx index .",
    "the @xmath37-th node compressively samples the return signal to obtain @xmath46 samples per pulse ( please refer to fig . 1 of @xcite for a schematic of the receiver ) .",
    "let @xmath47 denote the number of @xmath48-spaced samples of the transmitted waveforms within one pulse .",
    "the effect of the compressive receiver of fig .",
    "1 of @xcite is equivalent to pre - multiplying by matrix @xmath49 a @xmath48-sampled version of the received pulse .",
    "the size of @xmath49 is @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the maximum delay among the return signals normalized by @xmath48 and is known in advance . here",
    "the obtained samples are then placed in vector @xmath53 , which can be expressed in matrix form as @xcite @xmath54 where    1 .",
    "@xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the doppler shift induced by the @xmath27-th target ; @xmath57 is an @xmath58 matrix that contains the transmit waveforms of @xmath20 antennas as its columns and @xmath59^t$ ] ; 2 .",

    "@xmath64 and @xmath65^t$ ] . here",
    ", we assume that the target returns completely fall within the sampling window of length @xmath66 , and that @xmath48 is small enough so that the rounding error in the delay is small , i.e. , @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath68 is the interference of variance @xmath69 at the @xmath37-th receiver during the @xmath38-th pulse , arising due to the jammer signals and thermal noise .",
    "discretize the angle , speed and range space on a fine grid , i.e. , respectively , @xmath70 $ ] , @xmath71 $ ] and @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "let the grid points be arranged first angle - wise , then range - wise , and finally speed - wise to yield the grid points @xmath73 . through this ordering , the grid point @xmath74",
    "is mapped to point @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "the discretized step is small enough so that each target falls on some angle - speed - range grid point .",
    "then ( [ rec_sig ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath77 where @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 in matrix form we have @xmath81 , where @xmath82^t$ ] and @xmath83}_{\\mathbf{\\psi}_{lm}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] according to the cs formulation , @xmath84 is the sensing matrix and @xmath85 is the basis matrix .",
    "if the number of targets is small as compared to @xmath2 , then the positions of the targets are sparse in the angle - speed - range space and @xmath86 is a sparse vector .",
    "the locations of the non - zero elements of @xmath87 provide information on target angle , speed and range . all the receive nodes forward their compressed measurements to a fusion center .",
    "we assume that the fusion center has the ability to separate the data of different nodes from each other .",
    "this can be done , for instance , if the nodes send their data over different carriers .",
    "the fusion center combines the compressively sampled signals due to @xmath88 pulses obtained at @xmath21 receive nodes to form the vector @xmath89 . using the predefined measurement matrices , the discretization of the angle - speed - range space , and also knowledge of the waveform matrix @xmath90",
    ", the fusion center obtains an estimate of @xmath86 by applying the dantzig selector @xcite .",
    "in this section , we discuss the design of the measurement matrix in order to improve the detection performance of cs - mimo radar . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we assume that all the nodes use the same measurement matrix , denoted by @xmath91 , which does not vary with time .",
    "since the targets are moving slowly , the doppler shift within a pulse can be ignored .",
    "generally , there are two factors that affect the performance of cs .",
    "the first one is the coherence of the sensing matrix .",
    "uup requires low csm to guarantee exact recovery of the sparse signal .",
    "the second factor is sir .",
    "if the basis matrix obeys the uup and the signal of interest @xmath92 is sufficiently sparse , then the square estimation error of the dantzig selector satisfies with very high probability @xcite @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a constant .",
    "it can be easily seen from ( [ error_bound ] ) that an increase in the interference power degrades the performance of the dantzig selector .",
    "the goal of measurement matrix design is to reduce the coherence of the sensing matrix and at the same time increase sir .",
    "the coherence of two columns of the sensing matrix , @xmath96 , corresponding to the @xmath27-th and @xmath97-th grid point is given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 .",
    "let the interference waveform at the @xmath37-th receive node during the @xmath38-th pulse be gaussian distributed , i.e. , @xmath100 .",
    "let us also assume that the noise waveforms are independent across receive nodes and between pulses .",
    "then the average power of the interference equals @xmath101 the average power of the echo reflected by the @xmath26-th target located on the @xmath102-th grid point of the angle - range space is approximately equal to @xmath103 therefore , the sir equals approximately @xmath104    the precise manner in which csm and sir affect the performance of the cs approach is unknown .",
    "although theoretical bounds for the @xmath105-norm of the estimation error have been proposed @xcite-@xcite , those bounds might not be relevant in applications in which the quantities of interests are the locations of the non - zero elements of the sparse signal , rather than the non - zero values themselves .",
    "this is the case in the problem at hand . in @xcite , an upper bound on the error probability of sparse support recovery , i.e.",
    ", the total probability of missed detection and false alarm , under the optimal decision rule was derived .",
    "although that upper bound is related to the detection of non - zero elements , it can not be used for the design of the measurement matrix because it is rather loose , and further , it involves eigenvalues of submatrices of a given sensing matrix corresponding to all possible sparse patterns for the signal of interest . in this paper , we determine the measurement matrix by optimizing a linear combination of csm and the reciprocal of sir .",
    "the csm can be defined in various ways .",
    "let us define csm as the maximum coherence produced by a pair of cross columns in the sensing matrix .",
    "this criterion works well for a uniform sensing matrix but might not capture the behavior of the sensing matrix in cases in which the coherence of most column pairs is small @xcite .",
    "however , this coherence metric is widely used for the cs scenario due to its simplicity @xcite@xcite .",
    "the optimization problem becomes @xmath106 where @xmath107 is a positive weight , which reflects the tradeoff between the csm and sir .",
    "the problem of ( [ measure_opt ] ) is not convex . in order to obtain a solution ,",
    "let us first view ( [ measure_opt ] ) as an optimization problem with respect to @xmath108 .",
    "furthermore , let us set the norm of the columns of the sensing matrix to @xmath109 , i.e. , @xmath110 ; this will significantly simplify the expression for @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "now , ( [ measure_opt ] ) can be reformulated ( using the approximation ( [ measure_opt ] ) ) as @xmath113 which is a convex problem with respect to @xmath114 .",
    "the first term in the objective refers to the maximum coherence of cross columns in the sensing matrix ; the second term is proportional to the noise power which is a linear function of @xmath114 .",
    "once @xmath114 is obtained , the solution of ( [ measure_opt ] ) can be obtained based on the eigendecomposition @xmath115 , as @xmath116 where @xmath117 is a diagonal matrix that contains on its diagonal the nonzero eigenvalues of @xmath118 , and @xmath119 contains as its columns the corresponding eigenvectors .",
    "another definition for csm would be as the sum of the coherence of all pairs of columns in the sensing matrix ( scsm ) . with this measure of csm ,",
    "the minimization problem becomes @xmath120 simulation results show that the solution of ( [ measure_opt2 ] ) can increase the number of column pairs in the sensing matrix that have low coherence as compared to the solution of ( [ measure_opt_new ] ) .",
    "the latter solution tends to increase the coherence of some column pairs in the sensing matrix which had low coherence .",
    "this is intuitively expected because solving ( [ measure_opt_new ] ) requires more constraints than ( [ measure_opt2 ] ) . in this paper",
    ", we use scsm to design the measurement matrix .",
    "the above proposed methods for optimizing the measurement matrix reduce the coherence of cross columns in the sensing matrix without amplifying the interference .",
    "these methods improve the detection performance of the cs - based mimo radar system , but incur an increased computational load as compared to cs - based mimo radar that relies on the conventional measurement matrix .",
    "the number of complex variables entering the convex problem of ( [ measure_opt2 ] ) is @xmath121",
    ". the computation complexity would be prohibitively high for large values of @xmath122 .",
    "also , for a large number of grid points @xmath2 , we have to deal with a large number of constraints .",
    "the optimal measurement matrix might be obtained and stored offline based on knowledge of grid points in the angle - range space .",
    "however , it would need to be updated once the basis matrix changes with the search area of interest .",
    "this would bring heavy burden to radar systems and thus might render the real - time application impossible .",
    "therefore , ways to alleviate the computational load are worthy of investigation .",
    "a suboptimal scheme for this problem that involves lower complexity is discussed next .",
    "let us impose a structure on the measurement matrix to be determined as follows : @xmath123 where @xmath124 is an @xmath125 unknown matrix to be determined and @xmath91 is a @xmath126 gaussian random matrix .",
    "then the number of variables in @xmath124 can be controlled by changing the value of @xmath127 .",
    "we can obtain @xmath124 by solving ( [ measure_opt2 ] ) with @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "furthermore , the structure in ( [ subopt1 ] ) enables a two - step processing for cs - based mimo radar that simplifies the hardware of the receive nodes .",
    "in particular , a receive node linearly compresses the incident signal by using @xmath91 . at the fusion center",
    ", all the signals forwarded by receive nodes are first multiplied by @xmath130 and then jointly processed to extract target information .",
    "we can think of @xmath131 as a type of post processing . in this way",
    ", the received nodes require no information about @xmath131 , which reduces the communication overhead for the fusion center and nodes .    in order to render the convex problem tractable ,",
    "the norm of the columns in the sensing matrix is set to be a constant .",
    "this increases the number of constraints .",
    "if the number of variables is not sufficiently high , there might not be enough degrees of freedoms to decrease the coherence of the sensing matrix as compared to the original one .",
    "since the number of constraints equals the number of grid points , the number of constraints can be decreased by reducing the search area .",
    "this can be done by considering grid points around some initial angle - range estimates , if such estimates are available .",
    "although the suboptimal construction in ( [ subopt1 ] ) significantly reduces the number of variables , solving ( [ measure_opt2 ] ) still requires high computational load .",
    "further , the solution needs to be adapted to a particular basis matrix . in order to avoid these two shortcomings of @xmath133",
    ", we next propose another measurement matrix that targets sir improvement only .",
    "as in @xcite , we impose a special structure on the measurement matrix , i.e. , @xmath134 where @xmath7 is an @xmath135 zero - mean gaussian random matrix and @xmath124 is an @xmath136 deterministic matrix satisfying @xmath137^t$ ] .",
    "the above structure serves two purposes .",
    "first , the matrix @xmath124 can be selected to improve the detection performance of the cs approach at the receiver .",
    "second , @xmath138 is always gaussian regardless of @xmath124 . as will be shown next , with the appropriate @xmath124 ,",
    "@xmath138 may not result is higher csm as compared to the conventional measurement matrix .",
    "next , we discuss the selection of @xmath124 .",
    "the average power of the echo reflected by the @xmath27-th target with respect to node locations , conditioned on the transmit waveforms , is approximately equal to @xmath139 where @xmath140 and its @xmath141-th entry can be expressed as @xmath142 .",
    "as already noted , the doppler shift within a pulse is ignored in ( [ sig_power_k ] ) .",
    "since the nodes are uniformly dispersed on a disk of radius @xmath143 , the distribution of @xmath144 is given by @xcite @xmath145 so that @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the first - order bessel function of the first kind . thus , based on ( [ property ] ) we can obtain @xcite @xmath148 where @xmath149 .",
    "as observed in @xcite , the terms multiplied by @xmath150 are small enough and can be neglected .",
    "thus , the average power @xmath151 in ( [ sig_power_k ] ) can be further approximated by @xmath152    inserting @xmath138 into ( [ inter_power ] ) , the average power of the interference can be approximated as @xmath153 where @xmath154 and @xmath155 are the @xmath141-th entries of @xmath156 and @xmath157 , respectively .",
    "the approximation in ( [ inter_power1 ] ) uses the constraint @xmath158^t$ ] and the fact that @xmath159 for sufficiently large @xmath127 due to @xmath160 .",
    "based on ( [ sig_power_k1 ] ) and ( [ inter_power1 ] ) , the sir is given approximately by @xmath161 where @xmath162 is an @xmath163 matrix of rank @xmath20 .",
    "the maximization of @xmath164 over @xmath124 can thus be approximated by the problem @xmath165^t_{\\tilde{m}\\times 1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it can be easily seen that @xmath166 contains as its columns the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of @xmath167 .",
    "since the largest eigenvalue of @xmath168 is not greater than @xmath169 , the maximum @xmath164 is bounded by @xmath170 the upper bound is achieved when the rank of @xmath57 equals @xmath109 , i.e. , all the transmit nodes send out the same waveforms .",
    "when orthogonal waveforms are utilized , i.e. , @xmath171 , the @xmath164 reaches the lower bound .",
    "it can be shown that , when the transmit waveform are orthogonal , i.e. , @xmath172 , @xmath168 has @xmath20 nonzero eigenvalues which are all equal to @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , for a fixed @xmath127 , @xmath173 , the optimal @xmath124 contains the @xmath127 eigenvectors of @xmath174 corresponding to eigenvalue @xmath109 and achieves maximum @xmath164 equal to @xmath175 .",
    "since the maximum @xmath164 is independent of @xmath127 , any matrix containing @xmath176 , eigenvectors of @xmath177 corresponding to eigenvalue @xmath109 would give rise to the maximum @xmath164 .",
    "however , @xmath178 results in smaller csm than any @xmath127 less than @xmath20 due to the fact that the rank of @xmath179 is @xmath127 .",
    "therefore , the optimal @xmath124 is @xmath180 for the case of completely coherent transmit waveforms in which the upper bound in ( [ sir_bound ] ) is achieved , the resulting @xmath181 is rank deficient .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath182 is not achievable since it depends on the time delay induced by a target , @xmath183 , which is unknown . to address this issue",
    ", we replace @xmath164 in the objective function in ( [ sir_pro ] ) with the average @xmath164 , where the average is taken over all possible delays , and is denoted here by @xmath184 . assuming that the time delay induced by the @xmath27-th target follows a discrete uniform distribution , i.e. , @xmath185 ,",
    "we can write @xmath186 where @xmath187[{\\bf c}_{0}{\\bf x},\\ldots,{\\bf c}_{\\tilde{l}}{\\bf x}]^h.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , the optimization problem that maximizes @xmath188 can be rewritten as @xmath189^t_{\\tilde{m}\\times 1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the solution @xmath166 of the above problem contains as its columns the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of @xmath190 . unlike ( [ sir_pro ] )",
    ", we can not find a close - form solution to ( [ sir_pro1 ] ) that has sufficiently high rank .",
    "further , the problem of ( [ sir_pro1 ] ) is non - convex .",
    "inspired by the form of ( [ opti_sir ] ) , we propose a feasible @xmath124 by taking all possible delays into account as follows : @xmath191.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath192 contains eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues of @xmath193 , utilizing ( [ subopt_2 ] ) results in the average @xmath164 bounded by @xmath194 where @xmath195 denotes @xmath196 .",
    "one can see that _ bound _ 2 would be reduced to _ bound _ 1 when @xmath197 .",
    "next , we examine the resulting sir based on three types of waveforms , namely a rectangular pulse , independently generated quadrature phase shift keying ( qpsk ) waveforms and hadamard codes . in particular , we show that using @xmath138 can suppress interference uncorrelated with the transmit waveforms , and maintains coherence as low as that corresponding to the gaussian random measurement matrix .",
    "let us consider a conventional measurement matrix @xmath198 , which is an @xmath61 gaussian random matrix of unit column norm with @xmath199 .",
    "the average power of the interference is @xmath200 ( see ( [ inter_power ] ) ) .",
    "let @xmath201 be a square matrix , formed by shifting the main diagonal of @xmath202 up by @xmath26 positions .",
    "it can be easily seen that @xmath203 .",
    "the average power of the target returns from @xmath3 targets at a receive node , conditioned on the transmit waveforms , equals @xmath204 where @xmath205      the proposed measurement matrix @xmath206 results in the same average interference power as the matrix @xmath207 .",
    "the average power of the desired signal conditioned on the transmit waveforms , @xmath208 , however , will improve .",
    "like ( [ sig_power ] ) , @xmath209 can be partitioned into the sum of the autocorrelation , @xmath210 , and cross correlation , @xmath211 , of the returns from @xmath3 targets .",
    "it holds that @xmath212    for orthogonal , or randomly generated waveforms across the transmit nodes , @xmath210 always dominates the average power of the desired signal . in order to increase @xmath213 ,",
    "the quantity @xmath214 in ( [ sig_power_one ] ) needs to be as large as possible .",
    "@xmath215 can be expressed as @xmath216 where @xmath217 denotes the matrix that contains the rows of @xmath90 indexed from @xmath26 to @xmath218 .",
    "( [ seq_cor ] ) implies that the non - circular autocorrelation of the waveform sequence of a transmit node , i.e. , @xmath219 , should be insensitive to the shift .",
    "this essentially requires a narrowband signal .",
    "based on this principle , the best candidate is a rectangular pulse and the maximum @xmath209 equals @xmath220 the equality in ( [ sinr_rec ] ) holds only if the targets induce identical delays and the sampling window is of a length that exactly covers the duration of target returns .",
    "obviously , the transmit nodes can not use identical waveforms .",
    "this is because the transmit waveforms are required to be orthogonal , or randomly generated in order to maintain low csm .",
    "similarly , the minimum average power of the desired signal is achieved when randomly generated qpsk waveforms are used , because such waveforms cover the widest bandwidth for the fixed pulsed duration @xmath22 and the length of waveforms @xmath47 .",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath209 is approximately @xmath221 for orthogonal hadamard waveforms that are of smaller bandwidth than the randomly generated qpsk waveforms , the average power of the desired signal equals approximately @xmath222 recall that @xmath166 corresponding to the true delay gives rise to the maximum received signal power .",
    "adding the terms @xmath223 to @xmath124 ( see ( [ subopt_2 ] ) ) would lower @xmath210 .",
    "when a coarse delay estimate is available , we need to consider only delays around that estimate and thus the length of the sampling window can be shortened .",
    "this effectively reduces the number of possible delays that are considered for the construction of @xmath124 .",
    "therefore , @xmath210 can be improved for the waveforms considered above if a coarse delay estimate is available .",
    "let @xmath224 and @xmath225 denote the sir corresponding to measurement matrices @xmath138 and @xmath226 , respectively .",
    "when transmitting hadamard codes , the sir gain induced by using the proposed measurement matrix can be expressed as @xmath227 where @xmath228 for a fixed @xmath229 and @xmath47 , with @xmath230 , @xmath231 can be bounded as @xmath232 therefore , lower and upper bounds on the approximate sir gain using hadamard codes are given by @xmath233 similarly , the sir gain using randomly generated qpsk waveforms is bounded by @xmath234 as long as @xmath235 and @xmath236 , @xmath237 is always greater than 1 . when @xmath238 , the lower bound on @xmath239 is higher than that on @xmath237 . for a sufficiently long @xmath47 and moderate @xmath20",

    "we examine the effect of the proposed @xmath124 in ( [ subopt_2 ] ) on the csm . for simplicity ,",
    "the targets are considered to be stationary and the possible delays for constructing @xmath124 are based on the range grid points used to form the basis matrix .",

    "the same conclusion applies to @xmath254 as well , i.e. , the coherence of @xmath255 is approximately equal to that of matrix @xmath256 .",
    "since @xmath257 is more ill - conditioned than @xmath124 , the conditional number of @xmath258 is greater than that of @xmath257 .",
    "therefore , using @xmath138 increases the maximum csm as compared to the gaussian random measurement matrix with high probability . however , for a well conditioned @xmath124 , the increase of the maximum csm caused by @xmath138 is negligible .",
    "we have proposed two measurement matrices based on different performance metrics .",
    "the advantages and disadvantages of @xmath259 and @xmath138 are summarized as follows .    *",
    "_ complexity _ + solving @xmath259 involves a complex optimization problem and depends on a particular basis matrix , while @xmath260 requires knowledge only of all the possible discretized time delays .",

    "the tradeoff between csm and sir results in @xmath259 yielding lower sir than @xmath260 .",
    "therefore , @xmath259 is expected to perform better than @xmath260 in the case of low interference , while it should perform worse in the presence of strong interference .",
    "in this section , we demonstrate the performance of cs - based mimo radar when using the proposed measurement matrices @xmath261 and @xmath240 , respectively . we consider a mimo radar system with transmit and receive nodes uniformly located on a disk of radius @xmath262 m .",
    "the carrier frequency is @xmath263 .",
    "the received signal is corrupted by zero - mean gaussian noise .",

    "a jammer is located at angle @xmath264 and transmits an unknown gaussian random waveform .",
    "the targets are assumed to fall on the grid points .",
    "@xmath265 compressed measurements are forwarded to the fusion center by each receive node .",
    "the maximum possible delay is @xmath266 .",
    "figure [ sinr ] compares the numerical and theoretical sir produced using the rectangular - pulse , hadamard waveforms and randomly generated qpsk waveforms for the case of @xmath267 transmit nodes and @xmath268 receive node .",
    "the sir performance , shown in fig .",
    "[ sinr ] , is the average of @xmath269 independent and random runs .",
    "the theoretical sir of these three sequences is calculated based on ( [ sinr_rec ] ) , ( [ sinr_hadamard ] ) and ( [ sinr_random ] ) , respectively . the power of thermal noise is fixed to @xmath109 and the power of the jammer varies from @xmath270db to @xmath271db .",
    "applying the proposed measurement @xmath138 at the receivers , the rectangular pulse and hadamard waveforms produce a significant sir gain over the gaussian random measurement matrix ( grmm ) , while the random qpsk sequence achieves almost no gain .",
    "furthermore , the numerical sir performance follows the theoretical sir for all three sequences .",
    "figure [ sir_l1 ] demonstrates the sir performance obtained by averaging over @xmath272 independent runs corresponding to independent interference waveforms , for different values of the maximum time delay @xmath229 .",
    "we consider a case in which only one target exists and the jammer power is 225 .",
    "one can see that a decrease in @xmath229 can significantly improve sir yielded by qpsk waveforms when @xmath229 is less than @xmath262 .",
    "in contrast , hadamard waveforms and rectangular pulse produce almost the same sir for different values of @xmath229 .",
    "this indicates that for qpsk waveforms the prior information of possible delays enables sir improvement , while for the other two types of waveforms considered prior information did not make a difference .",
    "figure [ conditionanumber_maximumcoherence ] shows the histograms of the condition number and the maximum csm using @xmath138 for hadamard waveforms and the grmm produced in 100 random and independent runs .",

    "one can see that the numerical results fit the observations in section [ coherence_sopt2 ] , i.e. , @xmath240 increases the maximum csm as compared to the grmm with high probability . in fig .",
    "[ correlation_sequence ] we use histograms to compare the csm corresponding to adjacent columns over @xmath275 independent and random runs .",
    "although @xmath240 incorporates information about the waveforms , the distribution of the column correlation does not change significantly as compared to that of the conventional matrix . among the three types of waveforms , the rectangular pulse gives rise to the worst csm distribution , indicating that the performance of the proposed cs approach would be significantly degraded if rectangular pulses are transmitted .",
    "this is because the high autocorrelation of the rectangular pulse results in high csm independently of the measurement matrix used .",
    "we consider a scenario in which @xmath276 and three stationary targets exist .",
    "the azimuth angle and range of three targets are randomly generated in 100 runs within @xmath277 $ ] and @xmath278 $ ] , respectively .",

    "[ roc1 ] and [ roc2 ] that @xmath290 and @xmath291 with hadamard waveforms can improve detection accuracy as compared to the grmm in the case of mild and strong interference , respectively .",
    "since an increase in the tradeoff coefficient @xmath283 can enhance sir , @xmath290 obtained from ( [ measure_opt2 ] ) using @xmath287 performs better in the case of strong interference than using @xmath286 .",
    "note that the three measurement matrices give rise to similar performance for @xmath292 and @xmath293 .",
    "this is because the interference is sufficiently small so that all the measurement matrices perform well .",
    "again , one can see that the mfm is inferior to the cs approach although it uses far more measurements than the cs approach .",

    "it is obtained by solving a convex optimization problem .",
    "this measurement matrix requires a heavy computational load as compared to the conventional measurement matrix , and also needs to adapt to a particular basis matrix .",
    "the computational burden of solving @xmath295 can be alleviated through reducing the number of variables involved in the optimization problem .",
    "the second proposed measurement matrix @xmath291 targets improving sir only .",
    "it is constructed based on the transmit waveforms and also accounts for all possible discretized delays of target returns within the given time window .",
    "@xmath296 is dependent on the range grid only and requires much lower complexity than does @xmath290 .",
    "it is shown that @xmath291 based on reduced bandwidth transmit waveforms can improve sir , but on the other hand , using waveforms that are too narrowband increases the csm , thus invalidating conditions for the application of the cs approach .",
    "therefore , the waveforms must be chosen carefully to guarantee the desired performance using the second measurement matrix .",
    "numerical results show that @xmath290 and @xmath291 with the proper waveforms ( e.g. , hadamard codes ) can improve detection accuracy as compared to the gaussian random measurement matrix in the case of small and strong interference , respectively ."
