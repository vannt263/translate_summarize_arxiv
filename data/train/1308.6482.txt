    "the dynamics of particles suspended in a fluid plays an important role for a large set of problems ranging from sedimentation and fluidization processes in industrial - scale chemical reactors to capillary blood flow in human microcirculation .",
    "especially the shear - induced mass transport in suspensions of non - spherical particles , such as blood cells , has grown to a very active field of research recently  @xcite .",
    "all these examples have in common that the gap between the surfaces of either two particles or between one particle and the geometry confining the flow frequently becomes small as compared to the particle size .",
    "the consequence are hydrodynamic short - range interactions mediated by the interstitial fluid that increase in strength as the distance of the surfaces decreases and that can play an important role in suspension rheology  @xcite but also in the dynamics of the suspended particles themselves  @xcite .",
    "the smallness of the gap between the surfaces allows for the assumption of stokes flow .",
    "thus , the forces and torques on the surfaces appear as linear functions of their translation and rotation velocities which is most conveniently formulated in terms of a resistance matrix . furthermore , the smallness of the gap allows a lubrication - theoretical treatment of the interactions . while the lubrication limit is treated already by goldman _",

    "it is found that while the surface - normal force induced by a relative translation of the surfaces along the same direction diverges as @xmath5 , all other interactions show a weaker divergence proportional to @xmath6 or even remain finite .",
    "claeys and brady  @xcite complete the study by cox  @xcite , taking into account the third- and fourth - order expansion coefficients of the local surface geometry which are required to compute all diverging terms for all matrix elements .",
    "the results are employed later for the stokesian dynamics simulation of suspensions of prolate spheroids by the same authors  @xcite . a computationally more efficient model for oblate spheroids that neglects long - range hydrodynamic interactions and for the computation of lubrication interactions locally approximates the interacting surfaces as spheres is proposed by bertevas _",

    "already resolving them at separations of @xmath7 of the particle radius would require lattice resolutions that are finer and computationally more expensive than the ones necessary to obtain accurate drag coefficients and particle interactions at larger separations  @xcite .",
    "similar problems arise also in other simulation methods with finite resolution , such as finite element methods  @xcite , stochastic rotation dynamics  @xcite , or dissipative particle dynamics  @xcite . in the case of spherical particles",
    "it is common practice to address these issues by correcting the lb method for particles near contact with the asymptotic expressions known from lubrication theory . while many implementations correct only for normal lubrication forces resulting from a central approach of the spheres  @xcite , nguyen and ladd  @xcite account for the leading divergence terms of the weaker non - normal interactions as well . to the best of the authors knowledge , a comparably accurate method for aspherical particles does not exist up to now .",
    "in fact , present applications of the lb and momentum exchange method to suspensions of aspherical particles often do not account for lubrication interactions explicitly  @xcite , ignore the torque resulting from asymmetric encounters  @xcite , or defer the description of short - range interactions to an empirical model  @xcite . on the other hand , ding and aidun",

    "it therefore appears that the present literature shows some uncertainty regarding the degree of accuracy actually required from lubrication corrections in lb simulations as well as regarding how to implement a sufficiently accurate lubrication model for aspherical particles .",
