    "spin transport in quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) with spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) attracts much interest because of non - trivial spin dynamics in a laterally confined electron system connected to electronic reservoirs .",
    "the interest is stimulated also by direct observations of the spin - polarized electron current passing through the qpc in the presence of soi ( ref .  ) and recent experiments in which spin - filtering properties of qpcs were successfully used to manipulate the electron spin in nonmagnetic systems based on two - dimensional electron gas in gaas .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a signature of qpcs is the conductance quantization staircase that occurs in the systems when electrons move ballistically through independent conducting channels ( transverse quantization subbands ) .",
    "the conductance is well described by famous landauer formula  @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the transmission coefficient for @xmath2th conducting channel not including spin . with decreasing the barrier height @xmath3 in the qpc",
    ", the channels are successively opened giving rise to a steplike increase in the conductance @xmath4 .",
    "this effect was observed in many experiments .",
    "@xcite    in the presence of soi the situation becomes much more complicated .",
    "when passing through the qpc the electron flow acquires spin polarization , and therefore , spin conductance should be considered along with the charge conductance .",
    "a rather general consideration of the charge and spin transport in two - terminal ballistic structures with soi is based on the scattering matrix formalism .",
    "@xcite in this way landauer formulas for the charge and spin conductances were derived for a mesoscopic system coupled to electron reservoirs in which the soi vanishes .",
    "@xcite since the two conductances are generated by unique scattering matrix , they should correlate  @xcite .",
    "the ascertainment of such a correlation is obviously very important for the investigation of the spin transport since it enables one to identify correctly the spin - polarization mechanism in experiments .",
    "ref .   demonstrated the correlations between the spin and charge conductances and their quantization for transport through a cylinder with the soi acting in a stripe .",
    "in the case of qpcs the problem of the spin conductance quantization remains insufficiently investigated yet , though the qpcs are one of most important model systems in mesoscopic physics .",
    "there is no unique opinion about specific features of the spin conductance , considered as a function of the barrier height or the fermi energy , and their relation to the charge conductance features .",
    "moreover , the spin - polarization mechanism in qpcs is not well understood , though it is clear from recent works that two factors are important : intersubband transitions of electrons  @xcite and the presence of transition regions where a laterally confined part of the qpc ( quasi - one - dimensional channel ) widens to the size of electron reservoirs of higher dimensionality  @xcite .",
    "particularly , unusual trajectories were revealed by silvestrov and mishchenko  @xcite within the quasi - classical approach to exist in these regions .",
    "eto et al .",
    "@xcite suggested that intersubband transitions , owing to which the polarization arises , occur just in the outer side of the qpc adjoining to anode reservoir .",
    "numerical evaluations of the spin polarization are quite optimistic .",
    "they show that the polarization can exceed 50% ( refs  ) , but the estimated polarization is very different depending on the specific models and parameters of the qpc used by different authors in their numerical calculations . there is a lack of theoretical studies of the spin conductance dependences of on geometric parameters of the qpc , as well as on the barrier height in the qpc",
    ". numerous calculations of electron waveguides with step - like constrictions in the presence of the soi ( refs  ) do not clarify these questions since the results they give are very complicated because of strong interference effect .",
    "the present work aims to clarify the mechanism of spin polarization and find out characteristic features of the spin conductance within a realistic model of a qpc with soi , which would be consistent with experimental situation where the geometrical shape of the qpc is rather smooth .",
    "we develop an analytical theory by considering the qpc as a saddle point in two - dimensional potential landscape .",
    "this is a very reasonable model , which was successfully used  @xcite to explain the conductance quantization steps in good agreement with the experiments .    in this paper",
    "we generalize this model by including the soi . in doing this",
    "we suppose that the soi is localized in the vicinity of the qpc and is absent deep in the reservoirs .",
    "this is a natural assumption in the case where the soi of the rashba type is created by gates forming the qpc .",
    "moreover , in such a way the ambiguity of the spin current definition in systems with soi is avoided .",
    "the spin current is calculated in the reservoirs where it is well defined .",
    "@xcite to be specific we consider the spin current injected into the right reservoir when electrons driven by an applied voltage move from left to right . in addition , we restrict ourselves by the case where the soi is weak , more precisely , the characteristic energy of the soi is small compared with other characteristic energies ( such as the barrier height , the fermi energy and the intersubband energy ) . this assumption is well justified for the structures fabricated on the basis of such semiconductors as inas and gaas , which are used in present experiments with ballistic qpcs .    in the frame of this model ,",
    "the charge conductance practically coincides with the standard quantization staircase since the soi induced correction to eq .",
    "( [ conductance ] ) is of the second order in the soi strength .",
    "the spin current arises in the third order of the perturbation theory .",
    "the spin conductance is determined by definite combinations of three matrix elements of electron transitions , two of which are intersubband transitions and one is intrasubband transition .",
    "we take into account all possible transitions to find finally the spin conductance and analyze its dependence on the parameters of the saddle - point potential and the spatial distribution of the soi strength . in the case of the rashba soi ,",
    "the spin current is polarized in the plane of the qpc normally to the particle current .",
    "the spin conductance magnitude is found to depend strongly on the longitudinal and transverse lengths of the saddle - point potential landscape .",
    "the spatial distribution of the soi strength affects the form of the function describing the dependence of the spin conductance on the barrier height .",
    "a general feature of this function is the presence of a maximum and nearby inflection point , the position of which correlates with the charge conductance steps .",
    "in addition , we show how this feature is distorted by the interference effect in the qpcs with sharp potential landscape .",
    "consider a qpc as a constriction created by gates in two - dimensional electron gas .",
    "we approximate the potential landscape by the function @xmath5 with a saddle point : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the longitudinal coordinate , along which the current flows , @xmath8 is transverse coordinate , @xmath9 is effective mass of electrons .",
    "this model potential is attractive because it admits an exact analytical solution and well simulates the qpcs studied in experiments .",
    "suppose that the soi acts in a region of finite size in the vicinity of the qpc and is absent deep inside the electronic reservoirs .",
    "when a small bias voltage @xmath10 is applied across the source and drain reservoirs , an unpolarized electron flow falls on the qpc from the left reservoir , acquires the spin polarization in the qpc and goes to the right reservoir .    for the sake of simplicity",
    "we consider the case where the soi strength depends only on the coordinate @xmath7 . in the case of the rashba soi ,",

    "it allows one to roughly estimate the dependence of the spin conductance on @xmath116 and @xmath162 .",
    "other factor is connected with the shape of the spatial distribution of the soi strength and the form of the potential barrier in the qpc .",
    "it is this factor that determines the dependence of the spin polarization and spin conductance on the barrier height .",
    "note , that in the presence of the soi , the dependences of the spin conductance on barrier height @xmath3 and the fermi energy @xmath105 are qualitatively different , in contrast to the case without the soi , where they are similar .",
    "the general feature of the spin polarization as a function of @xmath3 is the presence of peaks and nearby inflection points located close to the charge conductance quantization steps .",
    "we argue that these peaks originate from the presence of the sharp maximum that the wave - function amplitude reaches in the qpc when the barrier height is varied .    in the case where the potential landscape of the qpc is sharp",
    ", the interference of electron waves distorts this feature of the spin conductance as well as the form of the quantization plateaus of the charge conductance .",
    "the studies presented in this paper were carried out with using the approximations which restricted the applicability of the results in the following points .",
    "\\(i ) the perturbation theory imposes a restriction on the soi strength .",
    "in general form this restriction in rather complicated because perturbing hamiltonian contains both @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "however , in the practically interesting case where the transmission coefficient in a given subband is not too small , the following rough estimation is obtained @xmath165 where @xmath166 , @xmath106 is the transverse quantization energy , @xmath167 is characteristic wave vector of electrons in the qpq . the inequality [ eq .",
    "( [ restrict ] ) ] is obtained for @xmath168 . under realistic conditions of experiments ,",
    "@xmath169 , @xmath170 . with using the soi parameter @xmath87 for inas and gaas",
    ", one sees that the restriction [ eq .  ( [ restrict ] ) ] is well satisfied .",
    "\\(ii ) the conclusions about spin current dependences on the soi strength and the barrier height @xmath3 pertain to the case where the variables @xmath7 and @xmath8 are separated in the unperturbed hamiltonian , particularly to the case of the adiabatic separation of variables .",
    "@xcite if variables are not separated , the effect of spin polarization can appear in the first approximation in the soi strength , but the spin current depends on the nonadiabaticity parameter .",
    "note that in this case the subbands are mixed even in the unperturbed state and therefore the conductance quantization plateaus are destroyed .",
    "the question of the spin polarization requires a separate study which will be published elsewhere .",
    "\\(iii ) important restriction consists also in ignoring the electron - electron interaction which is very essential at low density of electrons . in qpcs",
    "the electron - electron interaction is known to produce a strong change in the electron structure of the ground state and the electron transport in the regime where the conductance is lower than @xmath171 and transport anomalies are observed , such as `` 0.7 feature '' and zero - bias anomaly .",
    "@xcite their nature is not clarified to date , but the most probable origin is the appearance of a spin - polarized electron state . though our consideration is not applicable to this regime , one can expect that the soi can give rise to a strong effect under such conditions .",
