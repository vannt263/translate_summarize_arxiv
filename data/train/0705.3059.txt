    "the most optically luminous known quasars ( @xmath9 ) serve as valuable astrophysical probes of extreme accretion conditions and the distant universe .",
    "these objects have been found to date at ; their resulting @xmath10 magnitudes of and relatively bright multiwavelength fluxes allow them to be studied effectively with a variety of facilities across the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "even if they are radiating near the eddington limit with @xmath11 , their energy outputs require nuclear black holes and thus they are presumably associated with the most - massive galaxies ; today many of these objects have likely evolved into supergiant ellipticals found in the cores of rich clusters . as the most - luminous , non - transient emitters at high redshift ,",
    "these quasars have been useful in cosmological studies including measuring absorption lines from intervening line - of - sight material ( e.g. , rauch 1998 ; wolfe et  al .",
    "2005 ; and references therein ) , assessing the cold dark matter cosmogony ( e.g. , efstathiou & rees 1988 ; turner 1991 ; springel et  al .",
    "2005 ) , and constraining the accretion history of the universe ( e.g. , croom et  al .",
    "2004 ; richards et  al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et  al .",
    "2000 ) is now providing the most - complete selection of highly luminous quasars to date ( e.g. , schneider et  al .",
    "2005 , hereafter s05 ) .",
    "a large fraction of these objects , about 2/3 , lack pointed or serendipitous detections ( aside from at @xmath12 , where pointed  observations have detected a large fraction ; e.g. , vignali et  al .  2003 , 2005 )",
    "accordingly , we have started a project aimed at improving understanding of the  properties of the most - luminous known quasars over as broad a redshift range as possible .",
    "the emission from quasars probes the innermost regions of their accretion - disk coronae where any changes in the mode of accretion might be most evident , and spectroscopy provides constraints on intrinsic and intervening absorption .",
    "recent studies of the  spectra ( e.g. , page et  al .",
    "2005 ; shemmer et  al .  2005a , 2006a ; vignali et  al .",
    "2005 ) and x - ray - to - optical spectral energy distributions ( seds ; e.g. , strateva et  al .",
    "2005 ; steffen et  al .  2006 ,",
    "hereafter s06 ) of quasars have generally shown no clear changes with redshift , although some exceptions have been found ( e.g. , grupe et  al .",
    "2006 ; kelly et  al .  2007 ) and at lower luminosities  spectral evolution may be observed ( dai et  al.2004 ) .",
    "these results indicate that the inner regions of quasars are largely insensitive to the enormous changes in large - scale cosmic environment occurring over the history of the universe .",
    "there is evidence , however , that the photon index ( @xmath7 ) of the power - law spectrum increases as @xmath13 increases ( e.g. , shemmer et  al .",
    "2006b ) and that the x - ray - to - optical flux ratio ( @xmath8 ; tananbaum et  al .",
    "1979 ) drops with increasing luminosity .",
    "studies of the luminosity and redshift dependence of @xmath7 and @xmath8  benefit from the widest possible sampling of the luminosity - redshift plane ; such wide coverage is needed to break the luminosity - redshift degeneracy invariably present in flux - limited samples . by systematically studying the most - luminous quasars over the full redshift range where they exist in the universe , , it is possible to populate one important region of this plane , complementing efforts to fill other regions of luminosity - redshift space ( e.g. , s06 ) .",
    "systematic  measurements of the most - luminous quasars also serve to broaden the well - sampled luminosity range available for study and thereby minimize the possibility of confusion by spurious correlations ( e.g. , yuan et  al.1998 ) .    in this paper",

    "we adopt a cosmology with @xmath14  km  s@xmath15  mpc@xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "about half of our sample of highly luminous quasars has been drawn from the sdss dr3 quasar catalog ( s05 ) .",
    "the sdss , an optical imaging and spectroscopic survey that aims to cover about one - quarter of the entire sky , targets active galaxies for follow - up spectroscopy primarily based upon their @xmath18 ( fukugita et  al .",
    "1996 ) colors and magnitudes ( e.g. , richards et  al .  2002 ) .",
    "active - galaxy candidates at @xmath19 are spectroscopically targeted if their @xmath10 magnitudes are ; high - redshift candidates are targeted if ( the limit at @xmath20 is imposed to avoid saturation and fiber cross - talk problems in the sdss spectroscopic observations ) .",
    "the dr3 quasar catalog has been constructed from sdss spectroscopic observations over a solid angle of 4188 deg@xmath21 ( about 10% of the sky ) .",
    "given the large areal coverage , this catalog should contain representative members of the population of the most optically luminous quasars in the universe ; i.e. , other surveys are unlikely to find a population of quasars significantly more luminous than those studied here .",
    ", further supports this assertion . ] about 60% of the most optically luminous quasars in the sdss dr3 quasar catalog had been discovered in earlier surveys , such as the hamburg quasar survey ( e.g. , hagen et  al .",
    "1999 ) , the second byurakan survey ( e.g. , stepanian et  al .",
    "2001 ) , the university of michigan survey ( e.g. , macalpine & lewis 1978 ) , and the palomar digital sky survey ( dposs ; e.g. , djorgovski et  al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "we sorted the dr3 quasar catalog upon @xmath22 and considered the 33 most - luminous quasars in the catalog for _ chandra _  targeting ( see figure  [ dr3_mi_plot ] ) .",
    "the number 33 was chosen based upon practical  observing - time considerations , and this sample size is large enough to provide statistically meaningful results . of the 33 most - luminous quasars ,",
    "11 already had detections in archival data and were not targeted ; these archival data have been utilized in our study .",
    "the remaining 22 quasars were proposed via the _ chandra_cycle  7 guaranteed time observing program , and 21 of them were awarded observing time .",
    "one of our targets , sdss  j100711.81@xmath23053208.9 , was awarded to another _ chandra _  observer ( s.f .",
    "anderson ) as part of a program studying bright and extreme broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars .",
    "we do not consider the omission of sdss  j1007@xmath230532 from our sample to be statistically problematic .",
    "in fact , owing to its bal - quasar nature , this object would need to be removed from most of our analyses of @xmath8 , @xmath7 , and other properties in any case .",
    "our sdss sample thus includes 32 quasars with @xmath22 values of @xmath24 to @xmath25 , all of which have sensitive  coverage ; we adopt @xmath26 as a practical minimum luminosity for our sample .",
    "these 32 quasars span essentially the entire range of redshift ( ) over which such luminous objects are known , although the source statistics at @xmath12 are limited .      for the highly luminous and optically bright broad - line quasars under consideration here",
    ", the sdss is not expected to suffer from substantial incompleteness biases . however , some incompleteness is expected due to the sdss spectroscopic limit of @xmath20 and the fact that , at and , the sdss colors of quasars intersect the stellar locus ( e.g. , richards et  al .  2002 , 2006 ; s05 ) .",
    "furthermore , about 5% of quasars are expected to be missed by the sdss , largely due to image defects and source blending ( vanden berk et  al .",
    "we have searched for missed quasars more luminous than @xmath26 in the area covered by the dr3 quasar catalog using the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) combined with accurate sdss photometry ( since the photometry in ned is not uniform and can contain significant errors ) .",
    "we have found only two missed quasars : apm  08279 + 5255 at @xmath27 ( e.g. , irwin et  al .",
    "1998 ) and hs  1603 + 3820 at @xmath28 ( e.g. , dobrzycki et  al.1999).020212.8 in the sdss area , which is identified as an exceptionally luminous @xmath29 quasar by rengstorf et  al.(2004 ) . however , that identification relied on the assumption that the single feature seen in a spectrum was the mg  ii line .",
    "given this tenuous identification we obtained a spectrum of this source using the low resolution spectrograph ( lrs ) on the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ; ramsey et  al .",
    "our spectrum does not show the emission feature seen by rengstorf et  al . , and we identify this object as a galactic star and not a quasar . ] apm  08279 + 5255 is a gravitationally lensed bal quasar with @xmath30 that slightly violated the sdss spectroscopic limit .",
    "hs  1603 + 3820 has a very rich spectrum of associated heavy element absorbers ( e.g. , misawa et  al .",
    "2005 ) ; it is near the redshift range where the sdss colors of quasars intersect the stellar locus and was missed by the sdss quasar color - selection algorithm by just 0.02  mag in @xmath31 ( g.  t.  richards 2006 , private communication ) .",
    "fortunately , both apm  08279 + 5255 ( chartas et  al.2002 ) and hs  1603 + 3820 ( pi : dobrzycki ) have  detections in archival pointed _ chandra _  observations , and we include these quasars in our analyses below as appropriate .",
    "after these two additions , we expect @xmath32% incompleteness for @xmath33 broad - line quasars at in the area covered by the sdss dr3 quasar catalog .",
    "the observation log of our sample , including these two additional sources , appears in table  1 ; this 34 object sample will hereafter be referred to as the `` core '' sample .",

    "our best - fit value has smaller confidence contours than those of previous studies and has an @xmath366 consistent with zero .",
    "some monte carlo simulations have suggested that correlations among @xmath8 , , and  may arise from the effects of luminosity dispersion in optically selected , flux - limited samples ( e.g. , yuan et  al .",
    "1998 ; tang et  al .  2007 ) .",
    "however , these studies have usually examined the effects of luminosity dispersion over a much smaller total range in uv luminosity ( ) than our full sample covers ( ) . in  3.5 of strateva et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) the authors estimated the dispersions of and  ( @xmath371 and @xmath372 , when expressed in log units ) and , using simulations , showed that the dispersions can not be responsible for the non - unity @xmath36  slope they found .",
    "they estimated that @xmath373 is not larger than 1.4 and is plausibly @xmath374 for their sample , and we expect these values to hold for our sample as well .",
    "the strength of our sample ( which builds upon strateva et  al .",
    "2005 ) comes , in part , from the large luminosity range we cover , which is much larger than the value of the luminosity dispersion in either band .",
    "tang et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) , in their  3 , do not    take full advantage of the large luminosity range and examine only a subsample from s06 [ and the smaller , high - redshift sample from miyaji et  al .  ( 2006 ) ] , where the luminosity range covered is only slightly larger than the dispersion .",
    "comparison of the parametric fits calculated by tang et  al .",
    "( 2007 , see their figure 8) with our full sample shows very significant disagreement between the data and the fits , especially at high luminosities , where our sample of the most - luminous quasars helps considerably .",
    "tang et  al .  ( 2007 ) , in their  5 , consider selection effects using monte carlo simulations of a sample more similar to the full s06 sample .",
    "they assume the true slope of the @xmath36  relation is unity and assess how much the observed slope , @xmath360 , can differ from unity .",
    "they require unrealistic combinations of @xmath371 and @xmath372 ( e.g. , with @xmath375 ) in order to obtain values of @xmath360 as flat as the 0.709 that we measure in equation ( 7 ) .",
    "while our @xmath360 value may be biased somewhat downward owing to inevitable selection effects in the presently available samples , it seems unlikely that the true slope of the @xmath36relation could be unity for optically selected quasar samples .",
    "we have analyzed the  properties of a large and statistically representative sample of the most optically luminous quasars spanning @xmath0 to @xmath1 across a redshift range of @xmath24.5 .",
    "our total quasar sample consists of 59 sources , including 32 from the sdss , two additional quasars that were missed by the sdss selection criteria , and 25 comparably luminous @xmath3 quasars .",
    "all of these sources have sensitive  coverage from either targeted _ chandra _  observations or from archival _ chandra _ , _ rosat _ , or _",
    "xmm - newton _  observations ; 58 of the 59 sources ( 98% ) have detections .",

    "( 2006a ) .",
    "our main results , derived for radio - quiet , non - bal quasars that are not gravitationally lensed ( i.e. , our `` clean '' quasars ) , are the following :    * the mean  power - law photon index for our sample of the most - luminous quasars is , consistent with values found in earlier studies . * any intrinsic absorbing material for the most - luminous quasars has been constrained to have a mean column density of @xmath376  @xmath6 , showing that the most - luminous quasars typically have little intrinsic absorption . * using joint spectral fitting , we have found no significant change in @xmath7 with cosmic time over the redshift range @xmath24.5 . *",
    "the mean @xmath8  value of the most - luminous quasars is @xmath8  @xmath302 ; this is in agreement with earlier studies and agrees with the predicted value from s06 [ at a mean luminosity of ] to within @xmath304 . * in our sample",
    "there is no significant change in @xmath8  with redshift from @xmath24.5 when binned and compared to a constant model , consistent with results found in some earlier studies . *",
    "combining our sample with that of s06 and shemmer et  al.(2006a ) results in a clean sample of 372 quasars . using a parametric modelling method on this sample , we found @xmath8  is clearly dependent on , but shows no significant dependence on redshift ( for three different parameterizations of redshift dependence ) .",
