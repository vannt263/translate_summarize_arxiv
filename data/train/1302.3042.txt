    "high strength and good ductility define the two most important mechanical properties of metallic structure materials .",
    "@xcite in materials , strength is usually controlled by the occurrence of grain boundaries , cracks , dislocations and other micro - structural defects .",
    "if such defects were not present , the strength would be limited by the stress at which the lattice itself becomes unstable with respect to a homogeneous strain .",
    "this stress referred to as the ideal strength , is the possible maximum strength of an ideal single crystal .",
    "the ideal strength is an inherent property of a material which can offer insight into the correlation between the intrinsic chemical bonding and the crystal symmetry and has been accepted as an essential mechanical parameter of single crystal materials .",
    "@xcite    the experimental data on ideal strength are rather limited , since it is difficult to measure the ideal strength using experimental tools .",
    "there are only few experimental data that were obtained from tensile tests for whiskers  @xcite and from nanoindentation experiments .",
    "@xcite recently , calculations of ideal strength became of great interest because they represent an upper bound to the strength of any real crystal on the attainable stress .",
    "the ideal strength may be calculated under special loading conditions : ideal strength in tension , e.g. , for high symmetry directions of cubic crystals under uniaxial load , or ideal strength in shear , e.g. , for common slip systems @xmath6 and @xmath7 in body - centered cubic ( bcc ) crystals .",
    "@xcite    the ideal strength is one of few mechanical properties that can be calculated from first principles . the ideal strength of refractory metals ( such as mo , nb , v , and w ) , late transition metals ( such as cu , pt and au ) , elements crystallizing in the diamond structure ( si , ge , and c ) as well as some ordered alloys ( tial and ni@xmath8al ) have been extensively investigated .",
    "@xcite for example , luo _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and nagasako _ et al . _",
    "@xcite focused on the ideal tensile strength ( its ) of the bcc metals mo , nb , and v in the @xmath9 directions .",
    "accordingly , in all of them the deformation starts along the bain path , but branches away onto an orthorhombic path before the face - centered cubic ( fcc ) point is reached . in mo , this orthorhombic distortion does not influence the its ; however , in nb and v , the branching occurs before the maximum stress on the tetragonal deformation curve is reached and hence causes a significant decrease in the its .",
    "the stress - strain relations and the corresponding theoretical tensile strengths of ordered @xmath10-tial ( _ _ l__@xmath11 structure ) alloy exhibit strong anisotropy in different crystalline directions originating from the structural anisotropy of @xmath10-tial .",
    "@xcite in spite of all these theoretical efforts , the first - principles description of the its in random solid solutions is rather limited .",
    "the only attempt  @xcite employed the virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) to study the its of the binary ti - v for concentrations of ti equal to and higher than @xmath12 at.% .",
    "the results showed the more ti is present in the alloy the more the its is decreased .",
    "vanadium rich ternary v - cr - ti alloys are important candidate structure materials for the first - wall / blanket of future fusion reactors .",
    "@xcite these v - based alloys exhibit excellent mechanical properties , decent thermal creep behavior , high thermal conductivity , good resistance to irradiation - induced swelling and damage , and long operating lifetime in the fusion environment .",
    "@xcite considerable efforts have been made to find optimal v - based alloy compositions that can endure the extreme environment of fusion - reactors .",
    "the available experimental data indicates that reasonable properties can be achieved by introducing a few percent ti and cr into the v matrix .",
    "@xcite consequently , the ternary v - cr - ti system has attracted broad interest , and in particular the compositions with @xmath13 at.% cr and @xmath14 at.% ti have been intensively investigated .",
    "@xcite to the best of our knowledge , most experimental efforts on v - cr - ti alloys have been devoted to the ductile - brittle transition temperature before and after irradiation , swelling properties , and impact toughness as a function of cr and ti contents .    as a promising structure material for fusion reactors , v - based alloys",
    "must not only withstand radiation damage but should also keep intrinsic mechanical properties and structural strength .",
    "thus it is necessary to study fundamental mechanical properties , such as elastic properties , which were systematically investigated for v@xmath15cr@xmath16ti@xmath17 random alloys ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) in our former works .",
    "@xcite the second - order elastic constants describe the mechanical properties of materials in the small deformation region , where the stress - strain relations are linear .",
    "the ideal strength describes the mechanical properties of the material beyond the elastic region , which is important during the alloy design .    in this work ,",
    "we use the all - electron exact muffin - tin orbitals method ( emto ) in combination with the coherent - potential approximation ( cpa ) to investigate the its of elemental bcc v and mo solids as well as mo@xmath20tc@xmath21 and v@xmath15cr@xmath16ti@xmath17 ( @xmath22 ) random alloys as a function of concentrations .",
    "the primary purpose of our work is to give an account of the application of the emto method to the calculation of its in bcc nonmagnetic metals and random alloys .",
    "second , we aim to provide a consistent theoretical guide to further optimization of the composition of v - based alloys for structure material applications .    the structure of the manuscript is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : computationalmethod ] , we describe the computational tool and all important numerical details . the results are presented in section  [ sec : resultsanddiscussion ] . here",
    ", first we assess the accuracy of our calculations by considering pure mo and v and then we study the effects of the alloying elements on the ideal strength of mo - tc and v - ti - cr alloys .",
    "we continue in section  [ sec : discussion ] with a discussion about the anisotropy of the attainable ideal strength and the trend of the computed ideal strength of mo - tc and the v - based alloys for the case of an isotropic poisson contraction making use of band filling arguments , canonical band theory , and structural energy differences .",
    "to explain the anisotropy of the attainable ideal strength and the trend of the computed ideal strength of mo - tc and the v - based alloys .",
    "the first - principle method used in this work is based on density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite formulated within the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) generalized gradient approximation for the exchange - correlation functional .",
    "@xcite the kohn - sham equations were solved using the emto method .",
    "@xcite the problem of disorder was treated within the cpa and the total energy is computed via the full charge - density technique .",
    "@xcite    the emto method is an improved screened korringa - kohn - rostoker ( kkr ) method ,  @xcite where the full potential is represented by overlapping muffin - tin potential spheres . inside these spheres ,",
    "the potential is spherically symmetric and constant in between . by using overlapping spheres",
    ", one describes more accurately the exact crystal potential compared to conventional muffin - tin or non - overlapping methods .",
    "further details about the emto method and its self - consistent implementation can be found in previous works .  @xcite the accuracy of the emto method for the equation of state and elastic properties of metals and alloys has been demonstrated in a number of previous works .",
    "@xcitehowever , to our knowledge , no cpa - based alloy theory has previously been employed in the ab initio determination of the ideal strength of random solid solutions .",
    "this may be ascribed to the limited accuracy of the classical cpa - based electronic structure methods for systems with reduced crystal symmetry . in this respect ,",
    "the present work represents a pioneering demonstration of the emto - cpa approach in ideal strength calculations for random alloys .",
    "the principles of the response of bcc crystals to uniaxial loading were developed by milstein _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite the first step in its calculations is to compute the equilibrium lattice constant of the material in the ground state structure .",
    "the present alloys adopt the bcc structure . in the second step ,",
    "an uniaxial tensile strain @xmath23 is applied along a specific crystalline direction which mimics a certain tensile stress @xmath24 . for each value of the strain , we relaxed the deformed structures , partially under constraints described below , to make sure that no internal forces remain in the crystal in directions perpendicular to the applied stress . from the above steps , we obtained energy versus strain curves and derived stress versus strain data .",
    "the first maximum on the stress - strain curve defines the its @xmath25 for the selected strain path .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     our calculated seds clearly substantiate an increase of @xmath26 with cr addition , while the opposite effect is observed upon alloying with ti .",
    "the function @xmath27 follows the same trend .",
    "on the basis of our simple estimate of the ideal strength ( table  [ table : strendiff : alloy ] ) , we conclude with respect to bulk v an increase of @xmath25 for the v - cr binary alloys and a reduction of the ideal strength in case of v - ti binary alloys .",
    "our data affirms the larger relative change of @xmath25 for the @xmath0 $ ] direction compared with the relative change of @xmath25 for the @xmath4 $ ] direction .",
    "we find for the equi - composition alloy v-5cr-5ti , that its ideal strength almost retains the ideal strength of pure v.    here we would like to bring up an interesting and important detail related to the above correlations . for the @xmath0 $ ] distortions in v - cr - ti alloys",
    ", it is found that the composition dependence of the ideal strength correlates well with that of the seds and also with the one followed by @xmath28 , which is ultimately determined by the composition dependence of @xmath29 .",
    "@xcite however , for the @xmath4 $ ] distortions , the ideal strength vs. sed correlation is not followed by the @xmath30 .",
    "for instance , cr increases the @xmath4 $ ] ideal strength and the sc - bcc energy difference , but slightly decreases @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in other words ,",
    "the present results confirm the often quoted @xmath29 vs. fcc - bcc energy difference correlation .",
    "@xcite however , no such correlation seems to be valid between the @xmath31 ( or @xmath30 ) and the sc - bcc energy difference .    for mo - tc alloys",
    ", tc decreases the ideal strength compared to the value of mo .",
    "the reason is that bcc mo has with approximately @xmath32 electrons , as obtained from our emto calculation , a larger @xmath33-band occupation than v. according to band filling theory and dft calculations ,  @xcite the fcc - bcc sed of tc is smaller than the one of mo which means a destabilization of the bcc structure with respect to the fcc structure .",
    "thus , based on eq .  , the ideal strength of mo - tc should be smaller than that of mo , which is in line with the results from fig .",
    "[ fig : mo ] .",
    "using the emto method in combination with the cpa , we have investigated the ideal strength of bcc v - based alloys in the @xmath0 $ ] , @xmath5 $ ] , and @xmath4 $ ] directions and of mo in the @xmath0 $ ] direction . in the @xmath0 $ ] direction , we calculated the its of v and v - based alloys along the tetragonal and orthorhombic deformation paths .",
    "all other ideal strengths considered in this work correspond to isotropic poisson contraction , viz .",
    "no shape change was allowed perpendicular to the uniaxial stress .",
    "the present computed values for both v and mo are in good agreement with previous calculations and thus confirm that our methodology has the accuracy needed for such kind of calculations .    for mo - tc random alloy , we have found that adding tc to mo decreases its its . in the case of v - based alloys",
    ", we have obtained that cr addition increases and ti addition decreases the ideal strength of bcc v in all three crystallographic directions . as a consequence ,",
    "the ideal strength of v - cr - ti alloys remains virtually unchanged if equal amounts of cr and ti are introduced into the v host .",
    "we have shown that the observed alloying effects on the ideal strength can be understood on the basis of band filling arguments and structural energy differences .",
    "the strength of a material in the range of validity of hooke s law is characterized by its elastic constants . in our previous paper",
    "@xcite , we investigated the strengthening effects of cr and ti on the elastic constants of disordered v - cr - ti alloys and found that cr increases the tetragonal shear modulus ( @xmath29 ) and ti decreases it , while alloys with equi - concentrations have similar @xmath29 values as the elemental v. the effects of cr and ti on the @xmath31 elastic constant of v are somewhat smaller ( and have opposite signs ) compare to those obtained for @xmath29 . on this ground , combining our findings for the elastic regime and those obtained in this work for the ideal strength of v - cr - ti ternary alloys , we conclude that cr strengthens the its and @xmath29 of these v - based alloys and ti has a weakening effect on both its and @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , it is known ,  @xcite that the @xmath26 seds in nonmagnetic transition metals scale with their @xmath29",
    ". this relation can now be extended to our vanadium alloys : an increase of the @xmath33-band filling by alloying cr to v leads to increasing @xmath29 and ideal stress along the @xmath0 $ ] direction , which scales with the corresponding sed .",
    "the effect of adding ti to the v matrix ( decrease of the @xmath33-band filling ) is opposite to that of cr addition on both @xmath29 and @xmath25 .",
    "we have shown that no similar correlation between @xmath31 , ideal strength and sc - bcc structural energy difference can be established for the @xmath4 $ ] mode .",
    "the present results offer a consistent starting point for further theoretical modeling of the micro - mechanical properties of technologically important transition metal alloys .",
    "based on these achievements , we conclude that the emto - cpa approach provides an efficient and accurate theoretical tool to design the mechanical strength of nonmagnetic bcc random solid solutions and reveal the composition dependence of this fundamental physical parameter . nevertheless , in such applications",
    "one should always monitor the basic muffin - tin and single - site cpa errors and make sure that they remain at acceptable level as a function of the lattice distortion and chemical composition .",
    "the extension of the present investigation to the case of magnetic alloys ( such as the stainless steels ) and to other bravais lattices is in progress .",
