    "graphene is a very promising table - top laboratory to indirectly probe some of the fundamental mysteries of nature @xcite .",
    "the low energy regime of its @xmath3 electrons is very well described by an effective theory that shares many of the features of a massless dirac quantum field theory ( qft ) in the presence of a background spacetime .    in order for graphene to keep its promises ,",
    "we need to have full control of what sort of fields are there and what they represent in a field theory language . in the vast literature on the gauge fields of graphene ( see @xcite , and @xcite for a recent review ) , there are a variety of proposals , sometimes practically valuable for the applications to condensed matter physics , but most of the time unsatisfactory for probing fundamental physics .",
    "the landscape of proposals ranges from @xmath4 monopolelike gauge fields in the case of graphene membranes with intrinsic curvature ( the inflated graphene buckyballs of @xcite ) to a concurrence of a spin - connection field and a @xmath5 field , in the case of purely strained graphene @xcite ( although sometimes non - abelian fields are evoked in this case as well @xcite ) . even in the simplest case , that is purely strained graphene",
    ", there is some confusion : does the spin connection arising from straining graphene give physical effects or not ? and , what is the interpretation of the @xmath5 field from a fundamental point of view ?    in this paper , we try to clarify part of this confusion , having in mind to come back to the full scenario of gauge fields in graphene in a forthcoming work .",
    "our principal conclusions are the following : ( 1 ) when only strain is present , spin connection plays no role ; only the @xmath5 pseudogauge field gives physical effects .",
    "( 2 ) when intrinsic curvature is present , spin connection plays a crucial role , to the point that , for small strain , it is spin connection that dictates most of the physics . in addition , we also clarify why some confusion might arise in relation to the non - abelian structure ( that is the lorentz group ) behind the weyl ( abelian ) pure gauge field @xcite .    to do that",
    ", we proceed as follows .",
    "we start off with the fully relativistic approach , and proceed by seeing that the weyl field associated to strain ( that is what the spin connection reduces to in this case ) is a pure - gauge field , that can never give a physical effect , unless non - trivial topology is involved . since we are in a pure strain configuration ( elastic deformations ) , and we only focus on local properties ( our samples here have infinite size ) , non - trivial topology of the weyl field is excluded _ a priori_.",
    "later we show , for the first time explicitly , that this fully relativistic approach is equivalent to the standard ( non - fully relativistic , static hamiltonian ) approach .",
    "we do so by showing that all the terms one obtains through the latter method are there also in the former . having the equivalence , this closes the debate on the physical effects of the spin - connection for pure strain .    on the other hand ,",
    "a crucial issue arises for the meaning of weyl symmetry itself .",
    "in fact , the weyl field is a pure gauge _ also _ when the membrane has nonzero constant ( hence non - trivial ) intrinsic curvature , and we know that physical effects emerge from there @xcite .",
    "how can we reconcile this , on general grounds , with the previous result ?",
    "we have solved the issue by first finding the equations that the conformal factor of the @xmath0-dimensional theory has to satisfy , in the case of zero curvature ( pure strain ) and in the case of constant curvature .",
    "this is interesting on its own right , as we have found a nontrivial generalization to @xmath0 dimensions of the classic liouville equation of two - dimensional differential geometry of surfaces , and of @xmath6-dimensional conformal field theories ( cfts ) .",
    "we then realize that the key difference between the flat and curved case , although they both give standard weyl invariance , lie in the absence or presence , respectively , of constraints on the @xmath0-dimensional spacetime . therefore , in the curved case , the theory effectively lives in @xmath6 dimensions where weyl symmetry is anomalously broken .",
    "this is an interesting classical manifestation of a quantum weyl anomaly .",
    "the paper flow is as follows : in section  [ top - down ] we recall the results of previous work that we need here , and set the notation . in section  [ sigmasigma ]",
    "we find the connection between spatial and spatiotemporal conformal factors that allow us to conclude that the spin - connection can not give physical effects for pure strain .",
    "we focus the last part of this section on the nonzero constant curvature case .",
    "we leave to section  [ contact ] to show explicitly how the standard hamiltonian and strain tensor language can be recovered from the fully relativistic formalism . after this _",
    "top - down _ approach , in the section [ bottom - up ] , we use the tight - binding condensed matter hamiltonian description , and comment on the peculiarities of the only gauge field that can describe strain .",
    "this latter road , that we call _ bottom - up _",
    ", is actually necessary because , this kind of gauge field could not be guessed within standard qft in curved spacetime . in the concluding section",
    "we also offer some scenarios of fundamental physics that this peculiar gauge field could help to realize .",
    "as is well known ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the physics of the large wavelength @xmath3 electrons of graphene , at half - filling , can be efficiently encoded within the dirac massless two - dimensional _",
    "hamiltonian_. in our approach , we include time to make it fully relativistic , although with the speed of light @xmath7 traded for the fermi velocity @xmath8 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ; hence , we start from the @xmath0-dimensional action [ flatactionweyl2 + 1 ] a = i v_f d^3 q | ^a _ a , where @xmath9 are the flat spacetime coordinates , @xmath10 are the usual dirac matrices in three dimensions , and we expand around only one of the two dirac points , as we shall focus on strain .    as shown in @xcite , the metric @xmath11 can also describe strain ; hence , we shall use the customary dirac action in that curvilinear background .",
    "as also pointed out in @xcite , we recall that although the system is @xmath0 dimensional , the riemann tensor @xmath12 , @xmath13 , has only one independent component , proportional to the gaussian curvature , @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , surfaces of zero or constant @xmath14 , make the metric flat or conformally flat , respectively , and both cases can be treated at once within a formalism that uses [ metriccf2 + 1 ] g _ ( q ) = e^2 ( q ) _ , where @xmath15 , and the information about the metric being flat or not is encoded in the conformal factor @xmath16 . the coordinates where the metric can be explicitly written in a conformally flat fashion , [ cfcoordinates ] q^(t , x , y ) , are , in general , different from the original coordinates @xmath17 .    therefore , the natural candidate action to describe strained graphene is ( for a while we shall use @xmath18 ) [ actionweyl2 + 1 ] a = i d^3 q | e_a^^a ( _ + _ ) , where @xmath19 , with @xmath20 $ ] , the lorentz generators , @xmath21 is the inverse of the three dimensional vielbein @xmath22 ( the dreibein ) , @xmath23 is the spin connection , and being in @xmath0 dimensions , we can write the spin connection in the one - index notation [ omega2 + 1 ] ^a_= ^a b c _ b c . here , @xmath24 is the non - abelian index of the local lorentz group so(2,1 ) , and @xmath25 is the vector index on the spacetime manifold . in this formalism , the index @xmath24 , a tangent spacetime index , plays the role of an internal / gauge index .",
    "the metric can always be written in more suitable coordinates @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the same time for both coordinate systems , and @xmath28 are the _ spatial isothermal _ coordinates of the surface @xmath29    the single scalar function @xmath30 identifies the surface / graphene membrane .",
    "other isothermal coordinates can be found , say @xmath31 , but the function identifying the surface is always the same could be written as @xmath32 with conformal factor @xmath33 being @xmath34 $ ] and @xmath35 . on the other hand , using the coordinates @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , @xmath38 , with @xmath39 , we recover the standard metric of the sphere @xmath40 . ] : [ intrinsicsigma ] ( ( , ) , ( , ) ) = ( , ) .",
    "when the surface described by @xmath30 has zero or constant curvature , the two metrics and both describe the same spacetime , although with different coordinates , g _ ( q ) = e^2 ( q ) _",
    "= g _ ( ) ; hence , their gaussian curvature can not differ . due to the simple structure of the metric in the two coordinate frames , it is easy to compute the gaussian curvature & = & - e^- 2 [ ^2 ] + & = & e^- 2 where @xmath41 , and @xmath42 . clearly , the two conformal factors are related , @xmath43 : if we know @xmath44 , we can write @xmath45 , and then knowing @xmath46 , we obtain @xmath43 . nonetheless , we have the general equations that @xmath16 has to satisfy for the two cases , for @xmath47 , [ eqforsigmaflat ] = - ( _ a ) ( ^a ) , which corresponds to @xmath30 harmonic functions ( i.e. , solutions of @xmath48 ) , and for @xmath49constant [ eqforsigmacurved ] = - ( _ a ) ( ^a ) + e^ 2 , which corresponds to @xmath30 liouville functions ( i.e. , solutions of @xmath50 ) .",
    "let us focus on the flat case which , since it corresponds to pure strained graphene , is the one of interest here . in this case",
    ", besides the obvious constant solution of , @xmath51 , we also have [ sigmaflat ] _ flat = - ( t^2 - x^2 - y^2 ) + c .",
    "the constant @xmath52 could be set to zero , but we shall keep it , to later compare with the curved case . for the conformal factor , the metric reads @xmath53 hence , nothing constrains the norm of vectors just as for the minkowski case [ normflat ] q ^2 = g _ q^q^= that means that @xmath54 truly describes a flat three - dimensional spacetime .",
    "in order to see explicitly that is in fact the minkowski spacetime , take the following change of coordinates : @xmath55 on these coordinates the line element is @xmath56 , showing that the singularities appearing in the metric are simply coordinates singularities due to our choice of nonstandard coordinates . as a result of that , when we use @xmath57 in the spin connection of [ aomegacf ] _ _ a b = ^c_(_c a ^_b - _ c b ^_a ) _ , we can safely use @xmath58 as a proper dreibein , because it indeed connects the tangent space with a flat manifold . here",
    "@xmath59 , and @xmath60 , and we used the result that in three dimensions @xmath61 .      therefore the action for the metric is @xmath62 and when the dirac field is properly transformed [ psiweyl ] = e^- ( q )  , where @xmath63 refers to the minkowskian flat spacetime @xmath64 [ see ] , the action is simply [ flataction2 + 1 ] a = i d^3 q | ^a _ a  , which refers to the background metric @xmath64 , which in turn is the unstrained situation .",
    "strain is gone altogether .",
    "it has no physical effects .",
    "another way to see this , is to stop at the action , i.e. , _ before _ implementing the transformation of the spinor as in , and consider the gauge field @xmath65 .",
    "this gauge field is itself a pure derivative , hence it can not produce any physical effect through its field strength f_a",
    "b = _ a _ b - _ b _ a = ( _ a _ b - _ b _ a ) = 0 , as can be seen also by explicitly computing @xmath66 and @xmath67 with @xmath57 in .",
    "the result is zero @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , from here , we see that the very well - known pseudomagnetic field ( and , for what matters , even a putative pseudoelectric field ) induced by pure strain , can not be accounted for by the spin - connection / weyl pure - gauge field .",
    "let us now comment on @xmath65 . as seen , this is a pure gauge field associated to the local weyl transformations and .",
    "indeed , the weyl field transforms as w_w_- _ .",
    "the reason why we do not have here the full weyl gauge field , @xmath69 , but only its pure gauge part , is due to the local weyl invariance of ; see @xcite .",
    "like any other weyl field , @xmath65 is an abelian gauge field .",
    "abelian gauge fields are those routinely used in the graphene literature , @xcite and @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath65 carries information on the non - abelian structure of the local lorentz group that is encoded in the spin connection .",
    "this information is in the tangent space index `` @xmath24 '' of @xmath65 ; see , and discussion in between . indeed , ( local ) weyl transformations , in general , rephrase spacetime scaling as an internal transformation .",
    "non - abelian gauge fields have also appeared in various discussions on the gauge field approach to strained graphene @xcite .",
    "the above mentioned properties are common to the full weyl gauge field @xmath69 ; hence , they hold also for theories that do not have local weyl invariance .",
    "the extra property of @xmath65 is that it is @xmath70 ; i.e. the true degree of freedom is just one scalar , @xmath16 , the one related to the two - dimensional spatial phonon , @xmath30 , of the graphene membrane , as shown before .",
    "these facts are fully transparent in the coordinates @xmath54 in .",
    "when the coordinates are different , the three aspects of this gauge field(i ) scalar nature , ( ii ) abelian field , and ( iii ) non - abelian lorentz structure  get mixed together , and they may appear , in the standard coordinates / frames used in graphene , as originating from different gauge fields , as we show in section  [ contact ] .      apparently , all seems clear : when @xmath71 , which should describe pure strain , no physical effects can be described by the qft in the curved spacetime approach .",
    "nonetheless , we also saw that when the gaussian curvature of the membrane is constant , a similar procedure could be applied ; hence , this seems to lead to conclude that also in that case as well , there is no physical effect .",
    "however , as we shall now show , this is not the case .",
    "when one solves , e.g. , for negative curvature , @xmath72 , one obtains [ sigmacurved ] _ curved = - ( t^2 - x^2 - y^2 ) + r , and evidently the associated @xmath73 and @xmath74 are zero .",
    "nonetheless , this time the metric reads @xmath75 and the light - cone becomes essentially singular due to the change of signature , typical of horizons in black hole spacetimes .",
    "hence , the light - cone is a proper killing horizon , as shown already when considering hawking effects reproduced on graphene ; see , e.g. , @xcite . let us now see what happens to the length of a position vector , [ normcurved ] q ^2 = g _",
    "q^q^= r^2 > 0 . that is a dramatic difference with the previous case (",
    "amusingly , the difference comes about because of the different multiplicative constant factors : @xmath76 for the flat vs @xmath77 for the curved case ) . in the curved case",
    "the coordinates obey a constraint ; hence , the effective theory lives in one dimension less , with the coordinates that we call @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "the behavior of the flat and curved case is depicted in fig .",
    "[ newspacetimes ] . furthermore",
    ", the @xmath58 in the expression for the spin - connection is not the dreibein anymore : the manifold index @xmath25 now refers to a true curved space .",
    "all of this makes us conclude that the action that corresponds to the curved case ( in the negative curvature case ) is ^(2)_eff i d^2 p | ^(_+ _ ) , where everything has been dimensionally reduced to the two dimensions and , in particular , the metric is the induced curved metric : g^(2 ) _ ( p ) = _ a b . as well known , this two - dimensional theory has a quantum weyl anomaly . hence , interestingly , through the classical constraints we have a manifestation of a quantum weyl anomaly .    the weyl ( trace ) anomaly is known to be in one - to - one correspondence with the hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "this is an interesting road to pursue for an alternative computation of the hawking phenomenon on graphene as the one present in the literature @xcite .",
    "to make contact with the literature focused on the phenomenology of graphene ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) we need first to move from the action in the @xmath54 coordinates to the hamiltonian in the @xmath80 coordinates , keeping the curvature radius @xmath81 finite .",
    "for @xmath82 , the @xmath54 coordinates are t & = & e^t / r [ coord1 ] + x & = & e^t / r e^ ( ) [ coord2 ] + y & = & e^t / r e^ ( ) [ coord3 ] to write the hamiltonian in the @xmath83 coordinates , we have to consider the action , legendre - transform it = dtdd()=dt dd , and follow the steps presented in the appendix a. this gives , for @xmath84 , [ h2phiavf(x ) ] h = - i d d ^ ( ^i _ i^ j _ j + v_f + v_f ^i a_i ) where @xmath85 are the pauli matrices , we have re - introduced @xmath86 and @xmath8 , and [ phiexplicit ] = e^2 _ y [ aexplicit ] a_1 = - , a_2 = - , [ fermiveltensor ] _ i^ j = v_f (    cc v_1 & v_1   + v_2 & v_2   +    ) , with v_1 & = & + v_1 & = & - + v_2 & = & - + v_2 & = & - .    the computations here were carried on for the @xmath16 in , for which we can present the coordinates - ; hence , the expressions for @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89_i^{\\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\tilde j}$ ] depend of that choice .",
    "nonetheless , even though the detailed expression of those quantities change for @xmath16 in , the structure of the hamiltonian remains the same for the case of interest of pure strain .",
    "we see here that , through this top - down method , we were able to reproduce all the terms except one that customarily appear in the literature of strained graphene ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the latter is the one gauge field that gives unambiguous physical effects , and that couples to the spinors with an imaginary factor ( an instance that , on its own right , is an indication that such field can not be a weyl field , see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the next section",
    "we shall extensively comment on this field . before moving to that ,",
    "let us get one step closer to the language usually adopted in the graphene literature .",
    "in fact , the former expressions are written in the language of conformal factors @xmath30 for the membrane and in isothermal coordinates whereas the usual approach employs strain tensors @xmath90 ( where , as customary , the @xmath91 measures the departure from the unstrained position ) , and cartesian coordinates .    although we started off with a fully relativistic formalism , due to the structure of the metric , everything of the previous expressions necessarily depends only on the spatial coordinates .",
    "henceforth , we can focus on the spatial metric only and make the customary ansatz that , in cartesian coordinates @xmath92 , [ guij ] g_i j ( x , y ) _ i j + 2 u_i j . on the other hand , this metric is related through a coordinate change to the one in [ legesonsigma ] g_i j ( q ) = _ k l e^2 ( ) = l_i j e^2 ( ( q ) ) .",
    "this needs to be considered in its infinitesimal form , i.e. , @xmath93 , so that @xmath94 , which gives , at first order , @xmath95 ; hence , [ gutildeij ] g_i j ( x , y ) ( _ i j + 2 _ i j ) ( 1 + 2 ) . comparing the two expressions and , we obtain the wanted link between conformal factor , cartesian strain tensor , and isothermal strain tensor u_i j _",
    "i j + _ i j .",
    "near the dirac points ( with our choice of the basis vectors in fig .",
    "[ honeycomb ] , @xmath96 ) , we can describe the behavior of the @xmath3 electrons of graphene with the following dirac hamiltonian , @xmath97 where @xmath98 are two - component dirac spinors , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 , with @xmath101 the usual pauli matrices , all emerging from the honeycomb lattice structure of fig .",
    "[ honeycomb ] .    for strained graphene ,",
    "the slope of the fermi cone is changed and the dirac points are shifted @xcite , @xmath102 , where @xmath103 and @xmath104 , so that the hamiltonian is now @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath2 , or @xmath107 where @xmath108 .",
    "this is the usual pseudogauge field interpretation of the strain effect in the graphene sheet @xcite .",
    "the third rank anisotropic tensor @xmath109 , contracted with the strain tensor @xmath110 , is defined in appendix b , and will be analyzed in the following , as this will help to clarify the peculiar ( anisotropic ) nature of this gauge field .    for homogeneous strain , the unstrained fermion @xmath111 is related to the strained one @xmath98 via a phase transformation @xmath112 the modification of the hamiltonian in the presence of an inhomogeneous strain is computed in @xcite . in this case",
    "becomes @xmath113 where we follow the dirac prescription @xcite , @xmath111 is the unstrained solution . as a consequence of time - reversal symmetry , each dirac point",
    "is charged with opposite sign .",
    "we can select a point @xmath114 as a reference strain , i.e. , a point where the strain effect @xmath115 could be gauged away .",
    "the phase acquired in could be interpreted as the circulation from the zero strain region @xmath114 to the strained one @xmath116 .",
    "we stress on the fact that the solution is _ formal _ : once the curl of @xmath117 is non - zero , the integral in is path - dependent ( is a non - reversible process ) .",
    "once we realize that the effect of the inhomogeneous strain is to shift the momenta of the fourier modes in a space - dependent way , we can interpret the situation as the @xmath118 fermion is in presence of an _ effective _ gauge field @xmath119 , which could give us a non - zero effective magnetic field if the curl of @xmath119 is non - zero , giving rise to the characteristic landau levels .",
    "this gauge field , frequently called in the literature `` pseudo gauge field '' , is the one we announced in the preceding part of this paper .",
    "clearly , it could not have guessed from the qft in curved space description .",
    "we can follow the trail of the non - trivial behaviour of @xmath119 as the result of the contraction of the strain tensor @xmath110 with the third rank tensor @xmath109 .",
    "this tensor is nonisotropic , which is zero in two dimensions @xcite . ] and its presence is due to the triad @xmath120 specific to the structure of graphene , which is built from two sub - lattices @xcite .",
    "the nontriviality resulting from this contraction could be seen in a simple example @xcite .",
    "consider the deformation vector @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the maximum value of the strain and @xmath123 is the length of the graphene sample , as represented in fig .",
    "[ strained - graphene ] .",
    "this is a nonsingular vector field , in the sense that its curl and divergence is zero , so it is an irrotational vector field without any source or sink .",
    "however , we notice here that the vector field @xmath119 resulting from the contraction of the corresponding strain tensor with @xmath109 is a clockwise rotational vector field with constant curl , as we can see in fig .  [ pseudo - gauge - field ] .",
    "this means that not only does the displacement vector @xmath124 matter but also the _ orientation _ of this vector with respect to the near - neighbor vector triad @xmath125 .",
    "so , the @xmath109 carries some memory of the lattice structure ( short - distance behavior ) , even in the continuum limit ( large - distance behavior ) .    to see more concretely that this is the case",
    ", suppose that we have two unstrained graphene sheet samples .",
    "the honeycomb orientation of both samples are such that one of them , say it sample @xmath126 , has the vector @xmath127 of the triad parallel to the @xmath128-axis , as in fig .",
    "[ honeycomb ] , while sample @xmath129 has vector @xmath130 parallel to the @xmath131-axis , see fig .",
    "[ graphene - samples ] .",
    "the orientation of the triad are both the same .",
    "a direct computation shows that the @xmath109 tensor are different for sample @xmath126 and sample @xmath129 .",
    "now let us apply to both samples the same strain deformation vector shown in fig .",
    "[ strained - graphene ] . for the sample @xmath126 ,",
    "the pseudogauge vector field gives us a constant pseudomagnetic field @xmath132 , while for the sample @xmath129 the pseudo - magnetic field is zero .",
    "so , even though in the continuum limit the two samples only differ by their orientation , hence should be indistinguishable by isotropy , the pseudo - magnetic field keeps track of the honeycomb orientation at the lattice level .",
    "a detailed study of the so - called `` memory tensors '' in the graphene honeycomb and kagom lattices is found in @xcite .",
    "once the curl of @xmath117 is not zero , equation is not single - valued , as we can see if we take a loop around the origin .",
    "we are assuming that the variation of the strain tensor @xmath110 is very small so , following the lines of @xcite , we can envisage a process to extract a physical meaning of the solution , even if it is not single - valued .",
    "consider a small planar box on the graphene sheet ( but very large compared with the lattice length @xmath133 ) situated at @xmath134 ( see fig .",
    "[ geometric - phase ] ) .        in the case of unstrained graphene ( @xmath135 ) , the solutions for the @xmath3-electrons have the form are operators and the wave packets are these operators applied to the vacuum . ]",
    "now , the idea is to strain the graphene sheet in such a way that in the box the strain is homogeneous ( constant shift @xmath117 of the dirac point as in the previous section ) and the associated magnetic field is almost zero in that region .",
    "the solution of the @xmath3 electrons in the box could be written using the dirac prescription @xmath137 we can see that @xmath118 in is single valued in @xmath138 and @xmath134 locally . now let the box be transported around a loop @xmath52 .",
    "after completion of the loop , there will be a geometrical phase change that can be computed using berry s formula @xcite @xmath139 taking into account that the @xmath118 are normalized , we end up with the result @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the magnetic flux enclosed by the loop .",
    "when only strain is present , the only gauge field that has unambiguous physical effects , is the one just discussed in section [ bottom - up ] .",
    "the structure we saw there , is reminiscent of the gauge field arising in the aharonov - bohm effect , although strictly speaking , in order to have this effect , we need a magnetic flux line crossing the loop @xmath52 and a zero magnetic field outside the line .",
    "this is also reflected in the fact that the flux obtained in is not constant and depends on the area enclosed by the loop .",
    "however , it could be possible to imagine a strain vector concentrated in some region of the graphene and assumed to be zero outside this region . then ,",
    "this procedure , recover the aharonov - bohm result .",
    "the aharonov - bohm effect is not new in the graphene literature and some examples of strain vectors were proposed in order to see this effect with particular procedures , see for instance @xcite .",
    "this gauge field could not have guessed from a top - down approach based on the standard qft in curved spacetime .",
    "in fact , we saw here that if we define standard classical functions on graphene membrane the only fields emerging are the metric and the spin connection , which do not reproduce the behavior of this pseudogauge field .",
    "this @xmath5 field can be put in correspondence with quantum field theoretical structures , such as the quantum anomalies . to see it ,",
    "one just needs to realize that the origin of such gauge field is entirely quantum mechanical , and related to the fact that a `` translation '' in configuration space @xmath142 , that is the straining of the graphene membrane , is necessarily associated with a `` translation '' in momentum space @xmath143 .",
    "hence , in the first quantization language of the wave functions , those operations are carried on by quantum operators @xmath144 that , for the very meaning of quantum mechanics ( that is the heisenberg uncertainty principle ) need to obey [ anomaly ] u(t_1 , b_1 ) u(t_2 , b_2 ) = e^(_1 _ 2 - _ 2 _ 1 ) u(t_2 , b_2 ) u(t_1 , b_1 ) , that are recognized , in the second quantization language , as instances of the nontriviality of the quantum field theoretical vacuum , and in turn of the quantum anomaly @xcite .",
    "therefore , our simple table - top laboratory , can help explore yet another arena of fundamental physics , that is the deep meaning of the quantum anomaly .",
    "on the other hand , this pseudogauge field , for the use of graphene we have in mind , is intriguing also because , as explained in the paper , it is a memory of the lattice structure ( that is the physics of the wavelengths comparable to @xmath133 , the lattice spacing ) in the continuum limit ( that is the physics of the large wavelengths ) .",
    "that means that it is a relic at low energy of the high energy behavior of the system .",
    "this is yet another reason why we can not reproduce this field from a top - down approach , because in such approach the isotropy of the graphene membrane is tacitly assumed .",
