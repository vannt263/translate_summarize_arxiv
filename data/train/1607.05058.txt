    "in current opinion the quark - gluon picture @xcite well describes strong interactions . according to this picture",
    "the mesons are built out of quark ( q ) and antiquark ( @xmath0 ) which are coupled by gluon ( @xmath1 ) exchange .",
    "it is supposed that this model of interaction describes mesons having any signature @xmath2 and lying in any mass region .",
    "this property of description we call _ universality of the quark - gluon picture .",
    "the hypothetic @xmath1 is quark - less , flavor - less electrically neutral particle .",
    "it has property of self - interaction which implies the existence of bound states of two or more gluons .",
    "such an object is called glueball ( g ) and is a singlet state of su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "g has similar properties as the @xmath3 singlet state and can interfere with this singlet as well as with octet isoscalar state , forming in this way new su(3 ) isoscalar states .",
    "_    essential property of g is that it is not observed as a separate particle . to be observable",
    "it must interact with other hadrons . for this to be the case it should have ability to mix with larger unitary multiplet .",
    "being mixed with nonet of @xmath3 states it forms a decuplet @xcite .",
    "then it is subjected to restrictions of unitary symmetry @xmath4 on decuplet components @xcite .",
    "g can be detected as one of the three interfering unphysical components creating the physical isoscalar states of decuplet @xcite .",
    "if it dominates one of these states then it is considered as the `` glueball candidate '' . hence ,",
    "identification of the g is possible on the ground of unitary symmetry .",
    "the unitary symmetry is perceptible due to property of mesons to form multiplets which are collections of particles having different but definite flavors and the same signature @xmath2 .",
    "they form octets , nonets and decuplets .",
    "each multiplet belongs to some representation of unitary symmetry @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath4 multiplets are analogical to the @xmath5 multiplets describing properties of electromagnetic interaction .",
    "but there is an important difference . in the @xmath5 multiplets differences between masses",
    "are usually neglected .",
    "therefore , this symmetry is considered exact . in the strong interactions",
    "the multiplets gather the particles having _ a priori different masses .",
    "we call them multiplets of broken @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "it is believed that the breaking announces interaction . _    the most apparent effect of breaking @xmath4 symmetry is the difference between isotriplet and isodublet meson masses of the particles belonging to the same unitary multiplet , ( e.g. @xmath6 and @xmath7 mesons ) .",
    "this breaking is described by gell - mann  okubo ( gmo ) mass formula for the octet states .",
    "the gmo formula is universal .",
    "other breakings are much weaker @xcite and are masked by gmo one .",
    "they can be exhibited if description of the multiplet complies with gmo requirement .",
    "such a gmo - restricted multiplet is named the multiplet of _ flavor symmetry .",
    "the effect of its breaking is described as _ anomaly .",
    "as gmo breaking is universal the anomalies can be observed in all flavor symmetry multiplets larger than octet .",
    "anomalies of flavor symmetry are very interesting as they comprise information about the interactions which we want to investigate . _",
    "_    anomaly of flavor @xmath4 can be observed as the anomaly of multiplet mass pattern .",
    "also it can be seen due to pattern difference of two ( or more ) identical multiplets differing only in @xmath2 signatures or belonging to various mass regions .",
    "the investigating anomalies provide information on interaction breaking of the @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "we now consider the problem of how to recognize anomalies . in the next two sections we remind how the multiplets are described and define the standard multiplet which provides pattern for anomalies search .",
    "the flavor @xmath4 multiplets are described by the model of vanishing exotic commutators ( vec ) .",
    "the model introduces a system of master equations ( me ) describing the light meson flavor multiplets @xcite @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 is power index .",
    "symbols of particle @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath7 stand for the mass squared of physical mesons , coefficients @xmath13 express the octet contents of isoscalar states @xmath11 @xmath14 where @xmath13 are real numbers as @xmath15 and @xmath11 describe uncharged states .",
    "hence , @xmath16 and index @xmath17 runs over all isoscalar mesons of the multiplet .",
    "numbering of the isoscalar mesons is chosen so that @xmath17 increases with growing mass : @xmath18 the me are linear with respect to unknown coefficients @xmath19 .",
    "solution defines wave function of the flavor multiplets provided the conditions ( [ d ] ) are satisfied .",
    "the nonet and decuplet are described by the solution of me for the multiplets @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the octet masses @xmath12 and @xmath22 make the basic input of me ( [ a ] ) .",
    "there exists only one multiplet which is determined by this input . for other multiplets",
    "this input is insufficient .",
    "the vec description guarantees that all flavor multiplets comply with gmo breaking .",
    "the number of me depends on the multiplet .",
    "the minimal number is @xmath23 , the maximal one is greater by the number of independent mass formulae ( mf ) .",
    "this reflects the fact that , apart from the coefficients @xmath19 , the me determine also the mfs of the multiplet @xcite .",
    "me describe the nonets for @xmath20 .",
    "the vec model reveals some of their properties which were not discussed before .",
    "vec distinguishes three kinds of nonets @xcite :    * gell - mann - okubo ( gmo nonet ) having no mf , + * schwinger ( s nonet ) having one mf , + * ideal ( i nonet ) having two mf .    the i nonet is described by the solution of the following system of me : +    @xmath24    solving the first two equations we calculate @xmath25 , @xmath26 as the functions of masses . next , substituting the @xmath27 s into third and fourth equations we obtain two mfs which determine the masses of mesons @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "the solution of me which describes the i nonet can be given as @xmath30 where n and s are isoscalar states of the ideal nonet .",
    "this solution is an effect of gmo restriction individually acting on @xmath4 nonet states . as the gmo breaking",
    "mechanism is universal the solution ( [ g ] ) is also universal .",
    "the i nonet is the only meson multiplet having this property ; other nonets as well as decuplets are subjected to more complicated breaking .",
    "simplicity of this solution and its explicit connection with gmo - breaking mechanism makes i nonet a pattern enabling exhibition of the nonet anomalies by comparison .",
    "the possibility of confronting properties of different multiplets arise from the fact that they are described by the same vec model .",
    "s nonet is the most frequently appearing multiplet of the light mesons .",
    "it is observed for several @xmath2 mesons in various mass regions @xcite .",
    "the s nonet has one mf . to get the solution for @xmath27 @xmath32 of me we need an extra condition enabling us to evaluate @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "we can use experimental value of one of the masses and calculate the second one with the help of mf .",
    "but the pair of isoscalar meson masses determined in this way differs from the ideal masses ( [ g ] ) resulting from single gmo - breaking of @xmath4 .",
    "the change of s - nonet masses @xmath28 , @xmath29 toward the i - nonet ones discloses the existence of an extra breaking of the already gmo - broken @xmath4 nonet .",
    "that , in turn , suggests the existence of interaction between the i nonet and some unknown particle which causes their mixing and creates a decuplet .",
    "vec predicts two kinds of decuplets : @xmath33 which has no mf and @xmath31 complying with one mf @xcite .",
    "the situation sketched above is described by @xmath31 which is defined by the system of me :    @xmath34    the solution determines @xmath19 @xmath35 which define decuplet wave function if the conditions ( [ d ] ) are satisfied .",
    "then the solution defines also the mf of the decuplet @xmath36    the nature of an extra particle whose mixing with the i nonet creates the decuplet is undetermined .",
    "vec only requires that an extra particle extending i nonet to @xmath31 decuplet should be an su(3 ) singlet ; it accepts all _ extending singlets which are usually mentioned , like @xmath37 , hybrid or multi - quark .",
    "then it would be possible that each @xmath31 arises due to mixing with some specific extending singlet and can have individual properties .",
    "_    our purpose is the opposite .",
    "we look for such extending singlet which creates decuplet as universal structure and at the same time describes most of the flavor decuplets . among extending singlets mentioned above only the @xmath37",
    "is supposed to have the property of universality .",
    "therefore , we use this name everywhere .",
    "the masses of the @xmath31 decuplet satisfy the mass ordering rule ( mor ) @xcite @xmath38 mor divides accessible region of the @xmath11 meson appearance into three separate subregions which are delimited by @xmath12 and @xmath22 .",
    "the states in each subregion are uniformly dominated by @xmath39 , @xmath37 , @xmath40 : @xmath41 therefore , we may introduce more transparent notation @xmath42 where n , g , s are basic states of the decuplet isoscalars . + changing indexes one can express mor ( [ ja ] ) in more transparent form @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 are dominated by @xmath39 , @xmath37 , @xmath40 respectively .",
    "this notation is convenient for comparing the properties of the @xmath40 nonet states with the @xmath31 ones .",
    "let us confront s nonet and @xmath31 decuplet descriptions .",
    "+ @xmath40 nonet may be considered as deficient @xmath31 decuplet built on the same basis of octet states @xmath12 and @xmath22 .",
    "mor restrictions on the @xmath40 nonet are known for a long time @xcite .",
    "applying decuplet notation of @xmath39 , @xmath37 , @xmath40-dominated states to nonet isoscalar states @xmath11 we present the nonet mor restrictions as @xmath47 these relations tell us that @xmath37 is included in all @xmath40 nonets .",
    "this suggests its essential role in creating nonets and decuplets .",
    "probably , within these multiplets the suitable @xmath37 is always `` ready to use '' since it is built of the gluons mediating the interaction between quarks included in the multiplet .",
    "this way @xmath37 becomes one of the constituents of the isoscalar mesons .",
    "notice that @xmath48 mesons forming octet include neither scalar @xmath3 state nor @xmath37 one .",
    "observe that the nonet description does not explain the origin of s nonet anomalies .",
    "moreover , the nonets are distinguished by results of biased experiments ignoring possibility of decuplet appearing .",
    "perhaps , results of these measurements should be reanalyzed .",
    "the @xmath31 description looks more reliable .",
    "in such a case the nature of @xmath37 could be probably interpreted in the spirit of van der waals - like interaction .",
    "let us continue the comments .",
    "+ the comparison of the s nonet mor ( [ m]a , [ m]b ) with @xmath31 mor ( [ l ] ) shows that n , g , s - dominated nonet isoscalar states @xmath11 are in both multiplets similarly restricted and occupy the same positions in relation to @xmath12 and @xmath22 bounds .",
    "looking over particle data @xcite we find that the mesons @xmath49 should be g - dominated .",
    "the decay modes of @xmath50 and @xmath51 do not contradict these assignments ; the g dominated structure of @xmath52 meson established earlier @xcite is now confirmed ; the @xmath53 should have g dominated structure if it exists @xcite .",
    "if it is really the case the nature of these mesons have been for a long time notoriously misunderstood .",
    "revealing this misunderstanding must have far - reaching implications to meson spectroscopy .",
    "some of the implications can be seen immediately .",
    "as all s nonets include g - dominated @xmath45 state , it follows that in each of the nonets n - dominated @xmath44 or s - dominated @xmath46 state is missing .",
    "these two omissions reflect two different anomalies of the s nonets .",
    "these nonets describe sets of different particles and implications of anomalies are different .",
    "the axial - vector mesons @xmath54 and @xmath55 provide good illustration of such situation)a and ( [ m])b imply different domains of nonet mixing angle @xmath56 : for ( [ m])a @xmath57 while for ( [ m])b @xmath58 where @xmath59 is ideal mixing angle @xcite . ] .",
    "one of the implications concerns determination of the mass of axial - vector @xmath54 meson @xmath60 .",
    "as s nonet mor does not include the @xmath44 state ( [ m]a ) the @xmath39-dominated state is not represented in this s nonet .",
    "@xmath31 description requires in this region two particles : one isoscalar and one isovector .",
    "this suggests that observed very wide bump of this meson @xcite @xmath61 should be attributed to two states : @xmath62 observe that missing isoscalar state @xmath44 is n - dominated and its structure is similar to structures of the @xmath63 mesons .",
    "this leads to the problem of their separation .    among the @xmath55 mesons only the isoscalar @xmath64 and isovector @xmath65 ones",
    "have known masses .",
    "these masses suggest that s nonet of these mesons obeys mor ( [ m]b ) .",
    "according to the decuplet mor ( [ l ] ) the other mesons should satisfy the relations @xmath66 missing one of these particles as well as poor knowledge of remaining particles masses do not allow for further conclusions .",
    "although signals from g dominated and s dominated mesons should be located on opposite sides of @xmath22 it may be difficult to distinguish them .",
    "the attribution of @xmath45 properties ( [ n ] ) to @xmath51 is symbolic .",
    "anomalies of the s nonets provide the evidence for the existence of further ( beyond gmo ) mechanisms of su(3 ) breaking .",
    "the anomalies are caused by interactions which are unknown .",
    "to recognize their nature is just a purpose of the s nonet investigation .",
    "the anomalies provide much weaker breaking than the gmo one @xcite .",
    "this requires much more accurate data to make them observable .",
    "the present data ( partly old and skimpy ) enable completing few nonets but generally are insufficient for completing decuplets .",
    "therefore , in the interest of present and future development of meson spectroscopy it is necessary to increase accuracy of the data and extend the measurements to other @xmath2 mesons .",
