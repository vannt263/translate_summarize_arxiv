    "a light - induced potential applied to a bose - einstein condensate can be used to make high momentum daughter bec wavepackets , which propagate through the parent condensate @xcite .",
    "such technique have been used to make an atom laser @xcite , to study the coherence properties of condensates @xcite , and to study nonlinear four - wave mixing ( 4wm ) of coherent matter waves @xcite . in the process of a collision between two condensates ,",
    "inevitably , some atoms would scatter away , forming often a noticeable hallo around the region of collision .",
    "the hallo at the level above noise indicates a profuse elastic scattering losses , and has been observed in various experiments , for example @xcite .",
    "a scheme of such a process is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where the collision of two condensates having mean wavevector @xmath0 is shown in the momentum space .",
    "the condensates are denoted by large dots and marked as @xmath1 .",
    "atoms from these two counter  propagating wavepackets undergo elastic collisions and can be scattered out into all the modes permitted by the energy and momentum conservation ( a pair of such states is marked with small dots ) .",
    "these modes lie within the three dimensional shell , which in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is represented by the gray ring .",
    "the elastic scattering loss is not accounted for by the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) .",
    "recently , some modifications of the gpe were proposed in order to incorporate this loss into the mean field dynamics .",
    "this has been done either within the slowly varying envelope approximation by adding an imaginary part to the scattering length @xcite , or by including a stochastic component to mimic quantum field fluctuations @xcite .",
    "interesting results were also obtained using method based on the field theory formulation in the lowest order of the perturbation approximation @xcite .",
    "so as to test the validity of various approximate schemes an exact ( nonperturbative ) model of collisional losses was proposed @xcite .",
    "it is valid both in the regime of spontaneous initiation and bose enhancement .",
    "this model assumes spherical non - spreading gaussians for the colliding wave packets and is capable of treating the number of scattered atoms as well as their statistical properties through the higher order correlation functions .",
    "here we study this model in more detail , including the nature of the transition from spontaneous to stimulated scattering and statistical properties of scattered atoms .",

    "a system of bosons interacting via contact potential is described by the hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a field operator satisfying equal time bosonic commutation relations , @xmath4 is the atomic mass and @xmath5 determines the strength of the inter - atomic interactions . since the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) is of the fourth order in @xmath6 , the heisenberg equation governing the evolution of the field , @xmath7 is nonlinear and thus , in general , analytically and numerically untractable . however , for some physical systems , a bogoliubov approximation can be applied leading to linear heisenberg equations .",
    "the idea underlying this approximation states that for some cases the field operator might be split into two parts : @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the first contribution describes macroscopically occupied modes , where the fluctuations are usually small ; hence its operator character might be dropped ( @xmath8 becomes a c - number wave - function satisfying gpe ) .",
    "the second part @xmath9 , called , `` above mean field part '' , representing fluctuations , requires full quantum mechanical treatment .",
    "since the initial state of the system consists of two counter - propagating atomic wave - packets and the `` sea '' of unoccupied modes , bogoliubov approximation can be applied .",
    "the splitting of the bosonic field is performed in the following manner :    @xmath10    where the subscript @xmath0 denotes the mean momentum of the colliding condensates and @xmath11 satisfies the time - dependent gpe . upon inserting eq .",

    "first , we expect that for as long as the mean kinetic energy of the scattered atoms ( @xmath13 ) is much larger than the interaction energy ( @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the mean density of the atoms in the condensate ) , the mean field energy terms @xmath16 $ ] , can be dropped , leading to @xmath17\\hat{\\delta}^\\dagger({{\\bf r } } , t ) .",

    "the first term , @xmath18 , is a source term .",

    "an example of such a process is illustrated in fig .",

    "the above arguments imply that the bogoliubov equation ( [ full1 ] ) can be simplified by dropping the off - resonant term and leaving only the source term .",
    "the evolution equation for the @xmath9 field finally becomes @xmath26 to simplify the dynamics even further we define and compare three characteristic timescales of the problem .",
    "let @xmath27 and @xmath28 be the width and number of particles in each of the colliding condensates .",
    "then , the collisional time , ( the time it takes for each wave - packet to pass through its colliding partner ) is defined by : @xmath29 . another characteristic timescale of the problem is the linear dispersion time ( time of the spread of the wave - packet due to kinetic energy term ) , @xmath30 @xcite . in the same manner the nonlinear dispersion time , which is the time of ballistic expansion in thomas fermi approximation @xcite , can be defined : @xmath31 .",
    "the dynamics of the system depends on the relations between these timescales .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the following dimensionless parameters : @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "when the number of elastically scattered atoms is small in comparison with the total number of atoms in both wave - packets and both linear and nonlinear dispersion timescales are much longer than the collision time ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) , we can neglect the change in population and shape of the macroscopically occupied functions @xmath36 during the collision . in our model",
