    "in the past two decades , a lot of progress has been made in applying nonperturbative approaches based on principles of effective field theories to understand low - energy strong interaction phenomena .",
    "one prominent example is the combination of chiral lagrangians with unitarization techniques , i.e. , the so - called unitarized chiral perturbation theory ( uchpt )   @xcite . compared to other phenomenological methods , uchpt has a more transparent link to the theory underlying the strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , and , as a result , is in principle improvable in a systematic manner . over the years",
    ", it has provided new insights into the nature of various hadrons , from the well - established hadrons , such as the @xmath3 or the @xmath4  @xcite , to those of the newly observed @xmath5 particles , such as the @xmath6  @xcite or the @xmath7  @xcite .    at the heart of uchpt",
    "are the interaction kernels provided by chiral lagrangians , which are constrained by qcd and its approximate symmetries , such as chiral symmetry and heavy quark spin / flavor symmetry and their breaking pattern .",
    "exact two - body ( @xmath8-channel ) unitarity can be implemented in different ways and a widely adopted approach is the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) approach  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the bs approach provides exact unitarity but loses crossing symmetry , compared to conventional chiral perturbation theory .    to simplify the solution of the bethe - salpeter equation , the so - called on - shell approximation  @xcite is often adopted .",
    "it assumes that the interaction kernel can be put on the mass shell with the argument that the off - shell terms can be absorbed by the available coupling constants and physical hadron masses .",
    "a vast amount of applications has shown that such an approximation works very well .",
    "nevertheless , from a formal point of view , one may prefer to take into account the full off - shell effects to have an order - to - order correspondence with the underlying results of chiral perturbation theory .",
    "such off - shell effects have been studied for pion - pion interactions up to next - to - leading order ( nlo )  @xcite and for the interactions between the pseudoscalar octet and the ground - state baryon octet up to leading order ( lo )  @xcite and nlo  @xcite .",
    "these studies mainly focused on the description of physical observables such as phase shifts over a wide range of energies , except in ref .",
    "@xcite where the contribution to the nucleon mass as a function of the pion mass was studied .    in the present work ,",
    "we aim to explore whether the off - shell effects in uchpt can lead to an improved description of the light - quark mass dependence of physical observables . for this purpose",
    ", we perform a study of the scattering lengths of nambu - goldstone bosons ( ngbs ) off @xmath1 mesons  @xcite in uchpt up to next - to - leading order . to our knowledge , this is the first of such studies performed in the heavy - light sector , thus extending many previous studies performed with the on - shell approximation  @xcite .",
    "we will show that by taking into account the off - shell terms of the chiral potentials , one can achieve an improved description of the lqcd data  @xcite . on the other hand , no qualitative difference is observed and therefore our results provide further support to the on - shell approximation for the light - quark mass evolution of the scattering lengths .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the relevant chiral potentials up to nlo are summarized and the formalism to solve the bethe - salpeter equation with the full off - shell dependence is explained . in sec .",
    "iii , we study the latest lqcd simulations of the scattering lengths of nambu - goldstone bosons off @xmath1 mesons and discuss the implications on the pole position of the dynamically generated @xmath2 resonance .",
    "a short summary is given in sec .",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for the details of the chiral lagrangians describing the interaction of nambu - goldstone bosons and @xmath1 mesons .",
    "as explained there , the @xmath8 and @xmath9 channel exchange terms play a negligible role at least in the on - shell approximation . since our main interest in the present work is to compare the results of the on - shell approach and the off - shell approach , we consider only the lo ( weinberg tomozawa ) and nlo contact potentials channel exchange terms",

    "it should be noted that the mapping of the chiral potential into a matrix form is not unique , but as long as the matrix form allows us to rewrite the bs equation to an algebraic equation , they are all equivalent .    with the introduction of the matrix representation , the bethe - salpeter equation of eq .",

    "relativistic loop functions involving a heavy particle , whose mass does not vanish in the chiral limit , contain the so - called power - counting breaking ( pcb ) terms . in the one - baryon sector",
    ", various approaches have been proposed to remove the pcb terms , such as the heavy - baryon ( hb ) formulation  @xcite , the infrared ( ir ) formulation  @xcite , and the extended - on - mass shell ( eoms ) approach  @xcite ( see , ref .",
    "@xcite for a short review about their respective advantages and limitations ) .",
    "traditionally , in uchpt with the on - shell approximation , no attention is paid to this particular fact since the effects of the pcb terms are effectively absorbed by the so - called subtraction constants ( for a recent discussion see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the studies taking into account the off - shell terms of the chiral potentials ,",
    "the heavy - baryon formalism is adopted in refs .",
    "@xcite , the ir formulation in ref .",
    "@xcite , and an approach similar in spirit to the eoms formulation was adopted in refs .",
    "one should note that , however , because of the loss of exact crossing symmetry , in principle one can not remove the pcb terms by a redefinition of the available low - energy constants ( lecs ) at the working order in uchpt .",
    "therefore , all the three formulations , the hb , the ir , and the eoms , should be viewed only as an ansatz to calculate the loop diagrams .    in the present work , in order to compare with the results of the on - shell approximation , we calculate the loop functions @xmath35 in the modified minimal subtraction ( @xmath46 ) scheme as in the on - shell approximation  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we set the renormalization scale at 1 gev and add one single subtraction constant to the one - loop scalar 1-point and 2-point functions for all the channels , i.e. , replacing @xmath47 by @xmath48 .",
    "it is well known that in the off - shell scheme the loop functions become more divergent compared to the on - shell loop function . nevertheless , these loop functions are uniquely regularized in the modified minimal subtraction scheme . since in the off - shell scheme ,",
    "an order by order matching to the perturbative chpt results is possible , one can introduce ( at least ) a subtraction constant for each scalar function , which can vary between different coupled channels ( determined by isospin and strangeness ) . then matching to the perturbative results at",
    "the appropriate order will allow one to fix or constrain these subtraction constants .",
    "j. nieves and collaborators have studied this in great detail for both the pion - pion and pion - nucleon interactions .",
    "see , e.g. , refs .  @xcite . however , such studies are only possible if one has enough experimental data which allow the extra subtraction constants to be fixed .",
    "the situation in the present sector does not allow us to perform such a study .",
    "as we will see , even with only one common subtraction constant ( or renormalization scale ) we can already obtain a @xmath49 smaller than 1 .",
    "therefore , we will leave such a comprehensive study for a future work once more lqcd / experimental data become available .",
    "the scattering lengths of nambu - goldstone bosons off @xmath1 mesons have recently been studied on the lattice  @xcite and the @xmath2 is found to be a bound state in the @xmath50 channel  @xcite . for our purpose , we focus on the @xmath0 simulations of ref .",

    "they have obtained the corresponding @xmath1 and @xmath52 masses as well . using these heavy - light meson masses , together with those of their physics counterparts , we are able to determine the values of the lecs @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as a result , at nlo",

    "this result should not be a total surprise .",
    "in refs.@xcite , it was pointed out that the off - shell effects , which manifest themselves through diagrams renormalizing the vertices and the hadron masses , can be absorbed by the available lecs and physical masses .",
    "of course , such `` renormalizations '' are only possible at the physical point , because otherwise one may have to use light - quark mass dependent couplings .",
    "therefore , to study the light - quark mass evolution of physical observables , one may wish to explicitly keep all the off - shell effects .",
    "our results show that this may indeed improve the description of light - quark mass dependence .",

    "the dependences of the @xmath1 and @xmath52 masses on the pion and kaon masses are provided by the next - to - leading - order chpt as in ref .",
