    "clusters of galaxies are the largest bound systems in the universe and , as such , have been used to study how matter is distributed over extremely large scales .",
    "they provide useful constraints for theories of large - scale structure formation and evolution , and are valuable ( possibly coeval ) samples for studying galaxy evolution in dense environments .",
    "studies of the cluster two - point correlation function and the power spectrum are important probes of large scale structure and the scenarios of its formation .",
    "correlations between optically and x  ray selected ( e.g. , rosat , chandra , etc . ) clusters are also of considerable scientific interest , and will help us better understand the various selection effects present in both types of cluster samples .",
    "most of the optical studies to date have been limited by the statistical quality of the available cluster samples .",
    "for instance , the abell catalog ( abell 1958 , aco 1989 ) suffers from a non - objective selection process , poorer plate material , a bias towards centrally concentrated clusters , especially those with cd galaxies , a relatively low redshift cutoff ( @xmath3 ; bahcall & soneira 1983 ) , and strong plate  to  plate sensitivity variations .",
    "still , many far  reaching cosmological conclusions have been drawn from it ( i.e. bahcall & west 1992 ) , although later studies have sometimes shown these to be flawed .",
    "additionally , projection effects are a serious and difficult to quantify issue .",
    "these effects resulted in early findings of excess large  scale power in the angular correlation function ( bahcall & soneira 1983 ) , and later attempts to disentangle these issues relied on models to decontaminate the catalog ( sutherland 1988 , olivier _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 ) . unfortunately , some of these will plague any optically selected cluster sample , including our own , but objective selection criteria and a strong statistical understanding of the catalog can mitigate their effects .    other catalogs preceding ours",
    "have been generated using objective means ( apm , dalton _",
    "_ 1992 ; edcc , lumsden _",
    "the apm group , for instance , used digitized @xmath4 ( blue ) plates from the southern sky survey ; the use of a single , blue band provides no color information to distinguish galaxy types , and is a poor choice for cluster detection because clusters are better delineated by redder , early - type galaxies in the redshift range we probe ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the survey presented here utilizes at least one color ( two filters ) , and is based on high resolution , low scattered light scans of photographic survey material , providing excellent classification and photometry .",
    "additionally , this survey will eventually cover the entire high ",
    "latitude northern sky , a much larger area than some prior efforts ( such as the edcc ) .",
    "this paper presents the initial results of an optical cluster survey based on dposs data , from two fields covering @xmath0 square degrees .",
    "we use the 3 bands ( @xmath6 ) of the dposs survey ( djorgovski _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) calibrated with extensive ccd data into the gunn @xmath7 system . from this data , we construct color - color diagrams for galaxies detected in all 3 bands .",
    "predicated on the morphology - density relation ( dressler 1980 ) , where redder , early  tpye galaxies ( e / s0 ) are preferentially found in higher density regions , we select galaxies that are more likely to appear in clusters based on their colors . alternatively , this can be viewed as a means of excluding galaxies that are more common in the field .",
    "after the color cuts are applied , we use the adaptive kernel technique ( silverman 1986 ) to produce a surface density map of galaxies . a bootstrap method is then used to construct the corresponding significance map , from which density enhancements are selected using the focas peak finding algorithm . while previous surveys have tested , and sometimes utilized , standard photometry packages for cluster detection ( shectman 1985 , lumsden _",
    "1992 ) , the novelty of our technique lies in the use of a color  selection technique , over a very large area of the sky , with an adaptive kernel to generate the input galaxy density maps .    in the next section of this paper ,",
    "we briefly describe the input data derived from dposs .",
    "calibration and classification issues are briefly discussed , followed by our color selection procedure .",
    "the third section covers the density mapping and peak selection .",
    "the fourth section presents our initial results for two dposs fields ( @xmath0 square degrees ) , and compares our results with those from previous surveys . in the fifth section ,",
    "we discuss measurements of cluster properties directly from the calibrated plate photometry , including our attempts to estimate cluster redshifts using colors . in the final section",
    "we discuss future work and present our conclusions .",
    "the northern sky optical cluster survey is based on data from the digitized second palomar sky survey ( dposs , djorgovski _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) , a digitization of the poss ",
    "ii three  band photographic survey of the entire northern sky ( reid _ et al .",
    "each plate covers @xmath8 on the sky , with neighboring plates overlapping each other by @xmath9 .",
    "the plates are scanned at stsci ( lasker _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) , with @xmath10 pixels .",
    "the typical seeing in the digitized data ( combining both the effects of telescope seeing , and the scanning process ) is @xmath11 .",
    "the digitized data are processed into catalogs at caltech using the skicat system ( weir _ et al . _",
    "the end result of plate processing is a catalog of all objects detected down to the limiting magnitude of the plate ( @xmath12 ) , with various photometric , positional and shape parameters .",
    "this data is collected from all processed plates into the palomar norris sky catalog ( pnsc ) , expected to contain @xmath13 galaxies and @xmath14 stars .",
    "classification of each object is performed by a decision tree , which has been shown to be @xmath15 accurate for objects brighter than @xmath16 ( weir _ et al . _ 1995a ; odewahn _ et al .",
    "the data are calibrated into the gunn system using an extensive collection of ccd imaging data obtained at the palomar @xmath17 telescope .",
    "typical photometric errors for extended sources at in each band are @xmath18 at 19th magnitude ( odewahn _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) .",
    "each field in each band is processed individually .",
    "the three resulting catalogs are cross  matched to create a composite list of objects for the field .",
    "we require a detection in both the @xmath4 and @xmath19 bands so that we can measure at least one color .",
    "@xmath20 detections are not required because the @xmath20 data are not as deep as the other two bands , and suffer from large plate sensitivity variations . in practice , however , the relatively bright @xmath21 magnitude limit imposed to maintain accurate classification results in most objects ( @xmath22 ) being detected in all three bands .    finally , those areas on the plate containing saturated objects are masked .",
    "these areas often contain large numbers of falsely identified galaxies , as the plate processing software handles large , bright objects improperly",
    ". the masked areas , on average , cover @xmath23 of the plate .",
    "figure 1 shows field 447 , with the masked areas enclosed in boxes .",
    "these areas are not used in cluster detection .    in this paper",
    ", we present results for two fields : 447 ( @xmath24 ) and 475 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "these fields were chosen because they are at relatively high galactic latitude ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) where the effects of dust are expected to be small ( but see the discussion in section 5 ) , and because scans in all three bands were available when this project was started .",
    "the morphology - density relation ( dressler 1980 ) has been observed in galaxy clusters at low redshift for nearly two decades . late ",
    "type galaxies are dominant in the field population , whereas early  type galaxies are preferentially seen in high density regions .",
    "therefore , any technique that can eliminate field ( i.e. late  type ) galaxies on the basis of some simple observable parameter will enhance the contrast of galaxy clusters relative to the background .",
    "dressler & gunn ( 1992 ) presented photometric data for seven rich clusters .",
    "they show that cluster galaxies follow a well  defined sequence in the @xmath28 vs. @xmath29 color - color space , whereas field galaxies occupy a much larger area in this space . by defining a locus of `` cluster galaxies '' , and using only those objects which satisfy this color criterion , it is possible to preferentially discard field galaxies from the sample .",
    "such a procedure was utilized effectively by odewahn & aldering ( 1995 ) in their cluster detection program .",
    "the palomar distant cluster survey ( postman _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) , using deep , multi  color ccd data , also employed colors to detect clusters and estimate their redshifts .",
    "however , no other large ( all  sky ) , systematic cluster survey has been able to use color information for this purpose , as the data simply did not exist .",
    "figure 2 shows the @xmath28 vs. @xmath29 diagram for galaxies which are matched in the three plate catalogs ( @xmath6 ) for field 475 .",
    "we use only objects classified as galaxies on the @xmath4 or @xmath19 plate ( whichever has better seeing ) , with calibrated magnitudes @xmath30 , where our classification accuracy is @xmath15 ( weir _ et al . _ 1995b ; odewahn _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) . in practice",
    ", this imposes an approximate redshift limit of @xmath2 on our cluster detection .",
    "initially , we defined a strict locus of cluster galaxies in the @xmath28 vs. @xmath29 space , similar to the prescription given by dressler & gunn ( 1992 ) . however , inspection of our color ",
    "color diagrams shows that the @xmath31 photometry is poor , resulting in large scatter in the @xmath32 color .",
    "we have therefore chosen to make color cuts in the @xmath33 space only .",
    "the chosen cuts in @xmath33 have two motivations . on the blue side , @xmath34",
    ", we are excluding blue field galaxies at low @xmath35 . on the red side , @xmath36 ,",
    "we are excluding objects that have a high likelihood of being either misclassified stars , or at high redshift .",
    "these color limits are marked in figure 2 . clearly , a significant fraction ( @xmath37 ) of galaxies in our catalog lie outside our chosen @xmath33 range .",
    "we have also tested different color selection criteria , and find that only the lowest significance clusters , usually near the plate edges , are affected .",
    "in addition , the @xmath38corrected colors for both e and scd galaxies are shown , for the redshift range @xmath39 , for the gunn filters used to calibrate the data .",
    "the differences between the actual plate filter / emulsion combination and the ccd filters used for calibration do not introduce any significant effects .",
    "the sharp turn in the @xmath38correction curves occur at @xmath40 , where the 4000 break passes from the @xmath41 to the @xmath21 band .",
    "not surprisingly , we can see evidence for the locus of cluster galaxies along the @xmath38correction track for early - type galaxies , albeit with large scatter . from this figure , it is clear that we are seeing galaxies out to @xmath40 , although we are very incomplete above @xmath42 .",
    "this is not surprising , as an @xmath43 early - type galaxy will have @xmath44 at @xmath2 for any reasonable cosmology .",
    "for comparison , figure 3 shows the results of a similar analysis of a number of abell clusters imaged at the palomar @xmath17 telescope .",
    "the cluster galaxy sequence is very well delineated , but is clearly truncated for @xmath45 , as is well known ( abell _ et al .",
    "once a catalog of galaxies meeting our classification , magnitude , and color criteria has been created , we proceed to detecting candidate clusters .",
    "we have chosen to use the adaptive kernel ( ak ) technique ( silverman 1986 ) .",
    "this technique uses a two  stage process to produce a density map .",
    "first , at each point @xmath46 , it produces a pilot estimate @xmath47 of the galaxy density at each point in the map .",
    "we use a fixed epanechnikov kernel , @xmath48 of 15 width .",
    "based on this pilot estimate , it then applies a smoothing kernel whose size changes as a function of the local density , with a smaller kernel at higher density .",
    "this is achieved by defining a _ local bandwidth factor _ : @xmath49^{-\\alpha},}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the geometric mean of @xmath47 .",
    "we use a sensitivity parameter @xmath50 , which results in a minimally biased final density estimate , and is simultaneously more sensitive to local density variations than a fixed ",
    "width kernel ( silverman 1986 ) .",
    "this is then used to construct the adaptive kernel estimate : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the bandwidth .",
    "the choice of bandwidth is discussed below .",
    "this technique has many advantages over methods used by other surveys .",
    "first , the two  step process significantly smooths the low density regions , without affecting the high density peaks .",
    "the smaller kernel size at high density means that multiple clusters in high density regions ( e.g. , filaments ) are still separated .",
    "this technique may be more robust than percolation or friends  of  friends algorithms , which may link clusters in regions of high galaxy density , since they employ a fixed linking length .",
    "second , the ak does not require an assumed luminosity function or radial profile for the cluster , as did the matched filter of the pdcs . with our plate data ,",
    "the range in magnitude covered is small ( @xmath53 ) , so that fitting a luminosity function is a precarious endeavor .",
    "more importantly , perhaps , visual inspection of our candidate clusters shows that many ( perhaps most ) do not appear symmetric , so that any radially symmetric profile , assumed by some techniques like the matched filter ( postman _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) could produce biased results .",
    "we are attempting to avoid any bias towards rich , relaxed , evolved clusters ( which may occur if clusters are selected from x  ray surveys ) .",
    "this results in a catalog in which some clusters will have different physical properties than those discovered by other techniques and at other wavelengths .",
    "our density maps are created using @xmath54 pixels , resulting in a final map size of @xmath55 pixels for each field .",
    "the kernel itself has a bandwidth comparable to the abell radius of a cluster at @xmath56 , which is expected to be the median redshift of our cluster candidates .",
    "this combination of pixel size and bandwidth prevents us from over  resolving clusters into structural components , while maintaining a reasonable number of galaxies per pixel .",
    "once a density map has been constructed , we use the _ bootstrap _ technique ( press _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ) to build a significance map .",
    "this technique uses the input data set , @xmath57 , containing _",
    "n _ points , to generate synthetic data sets @xmath58 , @xmath59 , ... with the same number of points _",
    "n _ as the input set .",
    "these _ n _ points are selected at random from the input set , with replacement .",
    "this means that the same point can be selected more than once for each synthetic data set .",
    "we generate 500 synthetic data sets , each resulting in a density map @xmath60 , with map number @xmath61 and pixels @xmath62 .",
    "we define a mean map , @xmath63 , as :    @xmath64    and an analogous map @xmath65 :    @xmath66 ^ 2}}\\ ] ]    from these , we form a final significance map @xmath67 :    @xmath68    density maps and corresponding significance maps for fields 447 and 475 are shown in figures 4 and 5 .",
    "one can see that the structures seen in the significance map are also visible in the original density map .",
    "the significance map constructed using the bootstrap technique is then used to identify peaks in the galaxy distribution , which we mark as candidate galaxy clusters .",
    "we utilize the focas peak - finding algorithm ( jarvis & tyson 1981 ) to detect enhancements with @xmath69 significance , where @xmath70 is the @xmath71 of the background in the significance map . in practice , this is a very liberal detection threshold , in the sense that we accept a larger number of false detections in return for both enhanced completeness at higher redshift and lower richness .",
    "we also impose a minimum area requirement of 66 pixels , which corresponds to a circular region of @xmath72 mpc observed at @xmath73 .",
    "this yields 47 and 38 candidate clusters in fields 447 and 475 , respectively . to quantify our false detection rate ( which may be large at low significance )",
    ", we have undertaken a spectroscopic follow  up campaign to measure redshifts for all the cluster candidates in these two fields , with results to be presented in a future paper .",
    "the candidate clusters are marked in figures 4 and 5 , with abell clusters shown in green , and new clusters in white .",
    "we successfully recover all known abell clusters in these fields , and find a vastly larger number of new candidates .",
    "clearly , abell identified , in general , only the most significant density enhancements , although some rich clusters ( such as candidate 31 in field 475 , shown in figure 6 ) were still missed .",
    "after detection from the significance map , some simple properties ( such as size ) of the clusters are measured from the original density map .",
    "properties of the galaxy population of each cluster are derived from the input dposs galaxy catalogs .",
    "this helps to eliminate spurious detections , and allows us to compare our catalog with pre - existing catalogs . in this paper",
    ", we address properties measured directly from the plate data , while later papers will utilize additional ccd imaging and spectroscopic data obtained for the cluster candidates in these two fields for more detailed studies .      from the plate data , we wish to measure the redshift and richness of each cluster candidate .",
    "first we estimate the redshift assuming that each cluster candidate contains a single cluster , at one redshift , and is dominated by early - type galaxies .",
    "we count the number of galaxies as a function of color , @xmath74 , and the number as a function of @xmath21 magnitude , @xmath75 , inside the cluster area , as determined by focas from our galaxy density maps .",
    "the background galaxy color and magnitude distributions , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are determined from a large ( @xmath78 square degrees ) galaxy catalog around the north galactic pole , constructed from dposs data ( odewahn _ et al .",
    "this distribution , scaled to the appropriate area , is then subtracted from the color and magnitude distributions of each candidate cluster , and the median @xmath33 color and mean @xmath21 magnitude of the remaining galaxies calculated .",
    "figure 7 shows the @xmath74 distribution for a typical candidate before subtraction , the scaled @xmath76 background distribution , and the final @xmath79 distribution after background correction .",
    "as expected , the background galaxy counts are clearly bluer than the cluster galaxies .",
    "we also experimented with the use of locally derived background estimates .",
    "we found that the closer to the cluster the local background was determined , the lower the estimated cluster richness .",
    "this effect continues out to very large radii , and prompted the use of a global background estimate , which has been questioned in the past ( lumsden _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ) .",
    "this procedure was performed for 46 known abell clusters with measured redshifts @xmath80 , from 10 plates . however , in this case , we set the radius to the abell radius ( @xmath81 ) ( abell 1958 ) to measure the colors and magnitudes .",
    "we find that both the colors and magnitudes are equally well correlated with measured spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "we derive an empirical relation between redshift , median @xmath33 color , and mean @xmath21 magnitude using a bivariate least  squares fit : @xmath82    the @xmath71 of @xmath83 is @xmath84 .",
    "figure 8 shows the photometrically estimated redshift against the spectroscopically measured redshift for all 46 clusters .",
    "open circles show those clusters with only one galaxy with a spectroscopic redshift , and filled circles are clusters with two or more spectroscopic redshifts .    in practice",
    ", this must be an iterative procedure , because we do not initially know the redshift , and therefore the abell radius , for our cluster candidates .",
    "once a redshift is estimated , we then determine the abell radius ( @xmath85 ) for each candidate , and recenter on the median location of galaxies inside this radius .",
    "we then repeat the background correction and color and magnitude measurements inside @xmath86 , centered on the new location , and estimate the redshift anew .",
    "these steps are repeated until the redshift converges ; @xmath87 .",
    "the complete iterative procedure was also performed on the 46 clusters with measured redshifts . as expected , starting the process with the incorrect abell radius increases our errors .",
    "the final @xmath71 of @xmath83 is @xmath88 , with a mean offset of only @xmath89 .",
    "this error includes all random and systematic errors , such as plate  to  plate photometry , classification , background correction , and even incorrectly measured spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "approximately 50% of the 46 clusters used have only one galaxy with a measured redshift .",
    "this result does not vary strongly with the radius used ( @xmath90 or @xmath91 ) .",
    "in the future , as we gather more data , we will recalculate our photometric redshift estimator .",
    "additionally , we have ignored clusters with @xmath92 , as these are too extended for our technique to handle properly , and our photometric calibration for bright galaxies is currently too poor .",
    "we find the small errors from this photometric redshift technique to be remarkable , particularly in light of the data we are using .",
    "the data is taken from 10 plates in various parts of the sky , and therefore encompasses all of our photometric and classification errors , as well as varying amounts of extinction .",
    "the photometry is taken from photographic plates , where the quality is much lower than for ccds .",
    "additionally , the galaxy populations of these clusters must also vary ; the fraction of bluer , late  type galaxies is not constant with richness or redshift . in comparison , the apm group , utilizing a richness - dependent , magnitude  based redshift estimator , achieved similar errors over only a much smaller redshift range ( @xmath93 , dalton _",
    "1994 ) .",
    "we have attempted to estimate the richness of our cluster candidates in numerous ways .",
    "we tested abell s prescription ( counting galaxies between @xmath94 and @xmath95 mag , where @xmath94 is the magnitude of the third brightest galaxy ) , with and without a background correction applied , as well as simply counting all galaxies in the range @xmath96 .",
    "the richnesses of clusters with spectroscopic redshifts was measured from our catalog data , and compared directly to the data from abell ( 1958 ) . rather than use richness class ( which has a small range , is not continuous , and is dominated by poor clusters ) , we used the number of galaxies in the cluster .",
    "we find that there is a good correlation between our richness measures and those from abell for clusters at @xmath97 , but at higher @xmath35 , we consistently underestimate the richness .",
    "this effect is certainly not new ; scott ( 1953 ) demonstrated the redshift dependence of such a simple  minded richness measure .",
    "as expected , the degree of underestimation worsens as @xmath35 increases .",
    "this is due to the @xmath98 cut imposed due to classification . by @xmath99 , we are no longer able to sample a reasonable part of the luminosity function of the cluster , and at @xmath100 , only the very brightest cluster members are visible .",
    "we postpone discussion of richness estimation for a later paper .",
    "we plan to carry out further tests using objects fainter than @xmath16 , perhaps ignoring classification , as was done by croft _",
    ". at fainter magnitudes , the objects in a putative cluster should be predominantly galaxies , so that including them in a richness estimate may be feasible .",
    "this would force us to increase the limiting richness for a complete sample at higher redshift .",
    "we may also assume a schechter luminosity function , fitting only the bright end , and estimate a cluster s richness from the normalization of the lf .",
    "it should be noted that the apm survey did not encounter this problem because they limited themselves to @xmath101 for estimating richness and redshift .    in tables 1 and 2",
    "we provide the relevant information about the selected cluster candidates for fields 447 and 475 .",
    "column ( 1 ) gives the identification number of the candidate ; columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) show the right ascension and declination coordinates for j2000.0 ; column ( 4 ) shows the redshift estimated from our photometric technique ; and column ( 5 ) identifies which are abell clusters .",
    "where no estimated redshift is given our estimator failed to converge .",
    "an important consideration in the construction of an all  sky cluster catalog is extinction from dust in our galaxy . because the two fields considered in this paper are at high galactic latitude , the extinction correction is negligible .",
    "the mean extinction e@xmath28 derived from the schlegel _",
    "( 1998 ) maps is only @xmath102 and @xmath103 for fields 447 and 475 , respectively .",
    "nevertheless , our final all - sky catalog will use extinction corrected magnitudes and colors to derive cluster properties .",
    "it is also instructive to compare the @xmath104 iras map , and the galaxy surface density map , for another dposs field , number 479 , shown in figure 9 .",
    "it is clear that galaxies are extincted out of our detection threshold , creating false large - scale structure .",
    "this can not be avoided ; it is impossible to correct the color of a galaxy that is not detected .",
    "this effect has been largely ignored by past cluster surveys , which only corrected magnitudes of detected galaxies , or were restricted to areas of low extinction .",
    "( maddox , efstathiou & sutherland 1996 ) .",
    "this can have dire consequences for measurements of large scale structure , introducing false power on all scales .",
    "clusters are detected where the galactic extinction is low , and lost where the extinction is high .",
    "this non  uniform detection threshold across the sky must be accounted for when measuring the cluster ",
    "cluster correlation function , for instance .",
    "we have presented a simple but robust technique for generating an objective catalogue of galaxy clusters to @xmath2 over the entire high  galactic  latitude northern sky , using dposs data . with the multicolor nature of our data , and our demonstrated ability to measure redshifts photometrically , many scientific problems can be addressed .",
    "future papers will present cluster catalogs over large areas of the sky , stitched together seamlessly from individual field catalogs ( thus avoiding plate edge effects ) .",
    "fundamental astrophysical questions will be addressed , including the cluster ",
    "cluster correlation function and the evolution of galaxy populations in clusters .",
    "our observed cluster density , @xmath105 per square degree , is consistent with the detection of richness class 0 and higher clusters to @xmath2 .",
    "it is approximately 50% higher than the space density of clusters found by apm ( dalton _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ) .",
    "additionally , we have undertaken an extensive follow - up campaign , including deep ( @xmath106 ) 3-band ( @xmath7 ) ccd imaging at the palomar @xmath17 telescope , and multislit spectroscopy at the palomar @xmath107 hale telescope .",
    "every candidate in our two test fields will have both follow - up imaging and spectroscopy , with results to be presented in later papers .",
    "while this data will not free our sample of selection effects and biases ( most notably due to overlapping clusters ) , it will allow us to provide an unprecedented statistical understanding of our cluster catalog .",
    "the spectroscopy will provide redshifts of @xmath108 candidate clusters in the two fields described in this paper .",
    "we will be able to directly measure our false detection rate and the redshift distribution of our clusters .",
    "the ccd imaging will provide detailed constraints on our photometric and classification errors , in addition to enabling studies of cluster luminosity functions , galaxy populations , etc .",
    "the data may also be used in searches for clusters at higher redshift .",
    "finally , we note that the next large  area galaxy cluster catalogs will not be produced for some years",
    ". these will likely be redshift  selected samples from the 2df and sdss redshift surveys .",
    "the next complete photometrically selected sample , from the sdss imaging survey , is in the somewhat more distant future . until then , we hope that this modern catalog of galaxy clusters will be useful in broad  ranging , multi  wavelength studies by ourselves and other investigators .",
