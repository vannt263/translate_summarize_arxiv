    "coupled map lattices ( cmls ) are arrays of states whose values are continuous , usually within the unit interval , over discrete space and time . starting with turing s seminal work on morphogenesis [ turing 1952 ] , they have been used to study the behavior of complex spatiotemporal systems for 50 years .",
    "more recently , kaneko and collaborators have established many interesting results for cmls ( cf .",
    "kaneko [ 1993 ] , kaneko and tsuda [ 2000 ] ) as generalizations of cellular automata , whose state values are discrete .",
    "one key motivation for modeling spatiotemporally extended systems with cmls is to simplify the standard approach in terms of partial differential equations . and , of course",
    ", cmls would not have become accessible without the rapid development of fast computers with large storage capacities . within the last decades ,",
    "cmls have been applied to the study of areas as diverse as social systems , ecosystems , neural networks , spin lattices , josephson junctions , multimode lasers , hydrodynamical turbulence , and others ( cf .",
    "the special journal issues _ chaos _ * 2*(3 ) , 1992 , and _ physica d _ * 103 * , 1997 ) .    a compact characterization of a cml over two spatial dimensions with one time parameter is given by : @xmath0 for @xmath1 , the iterative logistic map characterized by the function @xmath2 is mostly used , where @xmath3 is a control parameter with @xmath4 , and @xmath5 represents the time step of the iteration .",
    "the indices @xmath6 are used to label the position of each cell ( or site ) in the lattice .",
    "@xmath7 is the number of cells defining the neighborhood of each cell ( with periodic boundary conditions ) , and @xmath8 runs over all neighboring cells .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 specifies the coupling between each cell and its neighborhood ( and is usually considered as constant over time and space ) .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath10 is a convex combination of the value at each individual cell and the mean value of its local neighborhood .    for @xmath11",
    ", there is no coupling at all ; hence , local neighborhoods have no influence on the behavior of the cml .",
    "this situation represents the limiting case of @xmath12 independently operating local objects at each lattice site . in the general case @xmath13 , the independence of individual cells",
    "is lost and the lattice behavior is governed by both local and global influences .",
    "cmls with a maximal neighborhood , @xmath14 , are often denoted as globally coupled maps .",
    "if the coupling is maximal , @xmath15 , the behavior of the entire cml is determined by global properties alone ( mean field approach ) .    the second term on the rhs in eq .",
    "( 1 ) contains the states of the neighboring map sites at the same time step @xmath5 at which the first term specifies the state of the site whose neighborhood is considered .",
    "this type of coupling , assuming a vanishing transmission time @xmath16 , is sometimes called `` future coupling '' [ mehta & sinha 2000 ] since it refers to a situation in which the neighborhood states are treated as if they act back from future to present . in this sense",
    ", we denote this type of coupling as `` non - causal '' . in order to take a finite transmission time @xmath17 into account",
    ", one can modify the second term in eq .",
    "( 1 ) such that @xmath18 is replaced by @xmath19 . in this way ,",
    "past states in the neighborhood of a site are considered to act on the present state of a given site with limited signal speed so that interactions are delayed rather than instantaneous . corresponding coupling scenarios , which we denote as `` causal '' coupling , have recently been studied by mehta & sinha [ 2000 ] , masoller et al .  [",
    "2003 ] , li et al .  [ 2004 ] , atay et al .  [ 2004 ] , and atmanspacher & scheingraber [ 2004 ] ( briefly a & s ) .",
    "another time scale important for the physical interpretation of eq .",
    "( 1 ) is the time interval @xmath20 assumed for the updating mechanism , i.e.  for the physical integration of signals from the neighborhood states with the state considered . if signals between cells are transmitted much slower than the time scale assumed for the updating mechanism , @xmath21 , the updating can be implemented ( almost ) instantaneously , or synchronously .",
    "if this is not the case , @xmath22 , updating must be implemented in an asynchronous way .",
    "this entails the additional problem of determining a proper updating sequence , which can be random or depend on particular features of the situation considered .",
    "much of the work on cmls so far was based on synchronous updating with future , or non - causal , coupling . for asynchronous updating as , for instance ,",
    "studied by lumer & nicolis [ 1994 ] , it was found that the behavior of cmls differs strongly from that of cmls with synchronous updating .",
    "additional results for asynchronous updating were reported by marcq et al .  [ 1997 ] , rolf et al .  [ 1998 ] , mehta & sinha [ 2000 ] , and a & s. particularly the last two references studied the behavior of cmls under causal rather than non - causal coupling .",
    "in contrast to the complexity and richness of the phenomenological behavior of cmls , investigating their stability properties simplifies the picture and bases the discussion on more fundamental considerations .",
    "the emergence of global properties from local properties of constitutents of a system are particularly interesting examples ( cf .  bishop & atmanspacher [ 2004 ] ) .",
    "for this reason , several authors have directed their attention to the analysis of the stability in cmls ( e.g. , mackey & milton [ 1995 ] , belykh et al .  [",
    "2000 ] , gade & hu [ 2000 ] , gelover - santiago et al .",
    "[ 2000 ] , mehta & sinha [ 2000 ] , jost & joy [ 2002 ] , lin & wan [ 2002 ] , anteneodo et al .  [ 2003 ] , a & s ) .    as a common feature of the ( so far ) few studies of asynchronous updating",
    ", it has been reported that it facilitates the synchronization and stabilization of cmls decisively .",
    "in particular , mehta & sinha [ 2000 ] demonstrated that the dynamics at individual lattice cells is strongly synchronized by coupling among cells . in a & s we showed that the local behavior at individual cells can be stabilized under causal coupling even if it is explicitly unstable .",
    "in other words , unstable local fixed points become stabilized as a consequence of their coupling to neighboring unstable fixed points . in this paper",
    "we study the dependence of this stabilization behavior upon variation of the degree of causal versus non - causal coupling for different kinds and sizes of neighborhood and different modes of updating . for this purpose",
    ", we represent the neighborhood term in eq .",
    "( 1 ) as a convex combination of causal and non - causal coupling : @xmath23 for @xmath24 , the case of full non - causal coupling as in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is recovered , while @xmath25 represents the case of full causal coupling as studied in a & s. note that convex combinations of causal and non - causal coupling as in eq .",
    "( 2 ) represent the situation of a causal coupling degree @xmath26 in each neighborhood site .",
    "this is different from a distribution of neighborhood sites with either full causal or full non - causal coupling even if this would give rise to the same overall @xmath26 .",
    "as an example , a neighborhood consisting of four sites with @xmath27 leads to behavior which is different from that obtained for two sites with full causal and two sites with full non - causal coupling ( although this also yields @xmath27 on average ) .",
    "the following section 2 presents the results of numerical simulations of cmls with synchronous and asynchronous updating , for different types and sizes of neighborhoods , for different coupling strengths @xmath13 , and for different degrees @xmath26 of causal coupling .",
    "it will be shown how the global stabilization of unstable local behavior depends on the degree of causal or non - causal coupling . in section 3 ,",
    "the results for different updating and different neighborhoods are compared and discussed .",
    "section 4 summarizes and concludes the paper , and some perspectives will be addressed .",
    "in this section , we present results from numerical simulations of two - dimensional coupled map lattices according to eq .",
    "since the focus of this contribution is on the stabilization of unstable behavior , we have to work within a parameter range in which the behavior of the logistic maps at each lattice site is unstable .    the quadratic function @xmath2 has two critical points , one at 0 and one at @xmath28 .",
    "the stability properties of these critical points are directly related to the derivative of the function @xmath2 at each of them . if the absolute value of the derivative is smaller ( greater ) than 1 , then the critical point is stable ( unstable ) .",
    "hence , the critical point at 0 is a stable fixed point for @xmath29 and unstable for @xmath30 .",
    "the critical point at @xmath28 is stable for @xmath31 and unstable for @xmath32 .    for our investigations , we focus on the more interesting unstable fixed point at @xmath28 and use the control parameter @xmath33 to demonstrate the results .",
    "( as far as the topic of this contribution is concerned , there is no basic difference in behavior for other values of @xmath3 as long as @xmath34 . )",
    "the corresponding unstable fixed point is located at 0.75 .",
    "we study the distribution of state values of a lattice of size @xmath35 ( @xmath36 cells with random initial conditions ) after a number of iterations which is large enough that transients have died out , usually after 10000 iteration steps .",
    "we consider different kinds of neighborhoods according to the second term of eq .",
    "results for both von neumann neighborhoods and moore neighborhoods will be presented , each of both order 1 and 2 .",
    "a von neumann neighborhood of order 1 includes the @xmath37 vertically and horizontally nearest neighbors of a given site .",
    "a moore neighborhood of order 1 includes the 4 diagonal nearest neighbors in addition , hence covering a square of @xmath38 cells in total .",
    "a von neumann neighborhood of order 2 is constructed by a moore neighborhood of order 1 plus the vertical and horizontal second neighbors of a given site , hence it consists of @xmath39 cells in total .",
    "a moore neighborhood of order 2 covers , in addition , all cells covering a square of side length 5 , hence @xmath40 cells in total .",
    "the behavior of cmls depends on the way in which the values at each cell are updated from one to the next iteration step . as two basic types of updating , we distinguish between synchronous updating , where all values are calculated subsequently but updated at once , and asynchronous updating , where all values are updated in the sequence in which they are calculated . for the latter procedure , it is crucial how the sequence is defined . in case of asynchronous updating ,",
    "those cells which are already updated affect the behavior of the cml before the update providing the next iteration step is complete .",
    "this does not happen in case of synchronous updating .",
    "the degree of causal versus non - causal coupling can be controlled by the parameter @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) . since updating mechanism and causal coupling introduce two time scales for a physically realistic interpretation of eq .",
    "( 2 ) , they are strictly relevant for the same time step only if @xmath41 .",
    "if this is not the case , we may `` simulate '' the effect of different time scales by rescaling @xmath42 ( or considering fractions or multiples of it ) so that it approximates @xmath20 . in this way , it is possible to study both causal and non - causal coupling in synchronous as well as asynchronous updating scenarios in a qualitative manner .      for the presentation of our results we use stability diagrams of the same kind",
    "as used in a & s. they are obtained by numerical runs of the cml given by eq .",
    "( 2 ) the runs are terminated after 10000 iteration steps for coupling strengths @xmath13 and for a degree @xmath43 of causal coupling .",
