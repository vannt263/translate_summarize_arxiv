    "the formalism of @xmath0-equivariant differential equations , ie . those equations whose associated vector field commutes with the action of a compact group @xmath0 has been developed by golubitsky , stewart and schaeffer in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . within this formalism , two methods for obtaining periodic solutions have been described : the @xmath1 theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ch.3 ) and the equivariant hopf theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "the equivariant hopf theorem guarantees the existence of families of small - amplitude periodic solutions bifurcating from the origin for all @xmath2-axial subgroups of @xmath3 , under some generic conditions .",
    "the @xmath1 theorem offers the complete set of possible periodic solutions based exclusively on the structure of the group @xmath0 acting on the differential equation .",
    "it also guarantees the existence of a model with this symmetry having these periodic solutions , but it is not an existence result for any specific equation .    in this article , we discuss the cases when @xmath0 is the tetrahedral group @xmath5 of symmetries of the tetrahedron and when @xmath0 is the octahedral group @xmath6 of rotational symmetries of the cube . as abstract groups , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are isomorphic to the symmetric group @xmath4 , but they correspond to nonequivalent representations both in @xmath7 and @xmath8 , generating nonconjugate subgroups of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively . identifying @xmath8 to @xmath11 yields two nonconjugate subgroups of @xmath12 .    for hopf bifurcation , the relevant action is that of @xmath3 , where @xmath13 acts by multiplication by @xmath14 in @xmath15 .",
    "it turns out that the matrix groups @xmath16 and @xmath17 coincide , although they correspond to inequivalent representations of @xmath18 .",
    "the analysis of equivariant hopf bifurcation is the same for both groups , but the interpretation is not the same for the two different representations of @xmath4 and hence the periodic orbits have different spatial and spatio - temporal symmetries .",
    "in addition , for the full group @xmath19 of symmetries of the cube , the matrix group @xmath3 is also the same as those above . as a consequence , we have one setup for bifurcation in @xmath11 with three different interpretations depending on which representation we consider .",
    "this raises the general question of the dynamical interpretation of equivariant bifurcation data for different representations of the same group that correspond to the same matrix group .",
    "a simple example is the group @xmath20 where the generator @xmath21 is mapped into @xmath22 in one representation , and to @xmath23 in another .",
    "the representations are not equivalent , but their image is the same matrix group and _ a fortiori _ the extension to @xmath24 has the same property .",
    "the situation in this article is even more special , in that the representations of @xmath4 have different images , but the image matrix groups for the extensions @xmath18 coincide , and they also coincide with the image of the extension of another group .",
    "a similar situation arises if the matrix groups of two inequivalent representations do not coincide but are conjugate within the group @xmath25",
    ". the conclusion would be the same , but it would not be so evident because the matrix groups would be different . the results in the present article indicate that this is a general problem worth studying .",
    "steady - state bifurcation problems with octahedral symmetry are analysed by melbourne @xcite using results from singularity theory . for non - degenerate bifurcation problems",
    "equivariant with respect to the standard action on @xmath7 of the octahedral group he finds three branches of symmetry - breaking steady - state bifurcations corresponding to the three maximal isotropy subgroups with one - dimensional fixed - point subspaces .",
    "hopf bifurcation with the rotational symmetry of the tetrahedron is studied by swift and barany @xcite , motivated by problems in fluid dynamics .",
    "they find periodic branches created at hopf bifurcation , as well as evidence of chaotic dynamics , bifurcating directly from the equilibrium  instant chaos .",
    "generic hopf bifurcation with the rotational symmetries of the cube is studied by ashwin and podvigina @xcite , also with the motivation of fluid dynamics .",
    "they also find evidence of chaotic dynamics , this time arising from secondary bifurcations from periodic branches created at hopf bifurcation . also relevant for this study",
    "are the extensive discussions of subgroups of @xmath9 and @xmath26 in articles by ihrig and golubitsky @xcite and by chossat and lauterbach @xcite , as well as in the books by golubitsky , stewart and schaeffer @xcite and by chossat and lauterbach @xcite .",
    "solutions predicted by the @xmath1 theorem can not always be obtained by a generic hopf bifurcation from the trivial equilibrium . when the group is finite abelian , the periodic solutions whose existence is allowed by the @xmath1 theorem that are realizable from the equivariant hopf theorem are described in @xcite .    in this article , we pose a more specific question : which periodic solutions predicted by the @xmath1 theorem are obtainable by hopf bifurcation from the trivial steady - state when @xmath0 is one of the groups discussed above ?",
    "we will answer this question by finding for each group that not all periodic solutions predicted by the @xmath1 theorem occur at hopf bifurcations from the trivial equilibrium . for this",
    "we analyse bifurcations taking place in four - dimensional invariant subspaces and giving rise to periodic solutions with very small symmetry groups . in particular , we find that some solutions predicted by the @xmath1 theorem for @xmath5-equivariant vector fields are not compatible with the @xmath3 action , and if they bifurcate from an equilibrium , they either have more symmetry or they arise at a resonant hopf bifurcation .",
    "this is also the case for @xmath27 .",
    "the relevant actions of the groups @xmath28 of symmetries of the tetrahedron , @xmath29 of rotational symmetries of the cube , @xmath19 of all symmetries of the cube and of @xmath3 on @xmath30 are described in section  [ section 1 ] , after stating some preliminary results and definitions in section  [ secpreliminary ] .",
    "hopf bifurcation is treated in section  [ sechopf ] , where we summarise some of the results of swift and barany @xcite on @xmath31 and of ashwin and podvigina @xcite on @xmath17 , together with the formulation of the same results when the group is interpreted as @xmath16 and as @xmath32 .",
    "this includes the analysis of hopf bifurcation inside fixed - point subspaces for submaximal isotropy subgroups , one of which we perform in more detail than in @xcite , giving a geometric proof of the existence of up to three branches of submaximal periodic solutions , for some values of the parameters in a degree three normal form .",
    "finally , we apply the @xmath1 theorem in section  [ sectionspatiotemporal ] where we compare the bifurcations for the three group actions .",
    "we start by giving some definitions from golubitsky and stewart s book @xcite .",
    "the reader is referred to this book and to chossat and lauterbach s @xcite for results on bifurcation with symmetry .",

    "we abuse notation saying that @xmath69 is a group of spatio - temporal symmetries of @xmath52 .",
    "this makes sense because the groups @xmath75 and @xmath67 are isomorphic ; the isomorphism being the restriction to @xmath68 of the projection of @xmath3 onto @xmath0 .    given an isotropy subgroup @xmath76 , denote by @xmath77 the normaliser of @xmath46 in @xmath0 , satisfying @xmath78 , and by @xmath79 the variety @xmath80 .",
