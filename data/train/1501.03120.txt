    "this last property has a very important consequence , namely that the dynamics of the whole gas depend on the quantity of real particles @xmath4 with respect to the total number of particles @xmath5 .",
    "our method is based on the introduction of a mixed 1d-2d log - gas whose stationary distribution is that of the spectrum of real ginibre matrices with @xmath4 real eigenvalues .",
    "this system is composed of @xmath5 interacting particles in a two - phase gas : @xmath4 of these particles are confined to the real axis and the other @xmath218 particles form @xmath219 pairs of complex conjugated particles outside the real axis .",

    "therefore , simulating the long term dynamics of the particle system will provide an approximation of @xmath21 .      in principle , it is possible to generate numerically the spectra of ginibre matrices conditioned on @xmath4 by drawing ginibre matrices at random and classifying them according to the number of real eigenvalues . however , for the events we consider , @xmath4 deviates from its expected value and @xmath7 decrease as @xmath146 , so that matrices with large @xmath4 are not readily accessible with such a strategy .",
    "as we dispose of an explicit form of the joint probability distribution of the eigenvalues under our constraint , standard sampling methods , such as the monte carlo algorithm described in appendix [ sec : mc ] , allow to access directly these rare events .",
    "unfortunately , they are not efficient for large matrices .",
    "the same limitations at large @xmath5 arise for simulations of the log - gas given that the system is stochastic and one needs to average over several runs to smooth out fluctuations . to overcome these",

    "we summarize our key findings , which can be considered educated guesses based upon known facts and numerical evidence ( see figure [ fig : contours ] ) .",

    "this closed curve varies continuously with @xmath49 .",

    "the gas provides a precise description of the minima of the potential   even at temperatures that differ from that corresponding to the eigenvalues of the ginibre ensemble . in particular , expansion of the energy of the system supplies further information on the microscopic organization of the particles at vanishing temperature . to this end , following the work for log - gases in dimension one  @xcite , two  @xcite or higher  @xcite , one shall compute the next - to - leading order terms of the energy .",
    "these terms correspond essentially to the microscopic arrangements of the particles .",
    "since we have shown that in the regime we consider with @xmath52 , there exists a macroscopic gap between the real axis and complex eigenvalues , the energy related to the microscopic interactions of real onto the complex eigenvalues and reciprocal forces vanish in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "once this has been noted , a direct application of the results in one and two dimensions  @xcite leads to state the following :    [ pro : renormalized ] for large @xmath5 , the equivalent energy of a ginibre matrix conditioned on having @xmath128 real eigenvalues enjoys the following expansion around @xmath284 the minimizer of the macroscopic energy : @xmath285 \\\\          - n\\big[(1-\\alpha ) \\int_{{\\mathbb{c } } } d\\mu^{c}_{\\alpha}\\log(\\mu^{c}_{\\alpha})+\\alpha \\int_{{\\mathbb{r } } } d\\mu^{r}_{\\alpha}\\log(\\mu^{r}_{\\alpha})\\big ] + o(n )      \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where the @xmath286 and @xmath287 are universal constants related to the dimension of the spaces where @xmath288 and @xmath289 are supported .    from this expansion",
    ", the minimization at zero temperature leads to state that the real eigenvalues crystallize  @xcite , and to the conjecture that the complex eigenvalues organize in a regular triangular lattice ( called abrikosov lattice in the superconductivity domain  @xcite ) , which is proved under the assumption that the organization is a regular lattice  @xcite .",
    "the main conclusions of our work can be outlined as :    1 .   despite the fact that the joint probability distribution of real ginibre matrices is always given the same compact formula above ( eq . ) ,",
    "the limit distributions of the empirical measure @xmath15 strongly depends on the number @xmath4 of real eigenvalues . when @xmath290 and @xmath9 , we prove that the empirical measure has a unique limit @xmath45 that significantly departs from the circular law .",
    "2 .   the key method in establishing the above result is an ldp theorem devised to take into account both real and complex eigenvalues .",
    "previous ldps discarded real eigenvalues , as in the unconstrained matrices , the fraction of real eigenvalues tends to zero .",
    "while we have provided the proof in the specific case of the real ginibre ensemble , it can readily be adapted to other situations , such as gases in higher dimensions with more general confining and repulsive potentials such as @xcite or heterogeneous gases @xcite with constraints ( fraction of particles restrained to a subspace ) .",
    "it also extends to gaussian @xmath36 and wishart ensembles conditioned on rare events ( such as anomalous proportions of eigenvalues in a given interval ) . in this sense",
    ", our approach provides a theoretical basis for the log - gas method used in  @xcite .",
    "these generalizations allow , for instance , to analyze the impact of anomalously large numbers of real eigenvalues on the spectra of random asymmetric matrices with some level correlations in the entries such as those in @xcite .",
    "3 .   one of the consequences of the ldp was to provide an asymptotic for @xmath291 which scales as @xmath292 $ ] . to our knowledge , this is the first derivation of large @xmath5 estimate for @xmath7 .",
    "4 .   the theoretical and numerical analysis of @xmath45 established that , unlike the circular law which is supported by a disk , the measure @xmath45 has two distinct components .",
    "the first is supported by a compact set of the complex plane that is well separated from the real line , and upon which @xmath45 has uniform density of mass @xmath293 .",
    "the second is supported by a segment in the real plane and has a density w.r.t .",
    "lebesgue s measure with mass @xmath49 . as @xmath49 increases to one , the support of the former shrinks to a single point and its complex conjugate whereas the latter tends to the semi - circular law on @xmath279 $ ] .",
    "the microscopic characterization of the particle distributions at zero temperature through the renormalized energy reveals that , ( i ) in the complex plane , particles organize in an abrikosov lattice , similar to the unmixed 2d gas , yet ( ii ) on the real line , they are crystallized similarly to the gaussian orthogonal ensemble in the zero temperature limit , but unlike real eigenvalues of unconstrained real ginibre matrices .",
    "the last two points above establish that the real ginibre ensemble constrained by @xmath41 interpolates between the circular and semi - circular law as @xmath49 shifts from zero to one at the macroscopic level . at the microscopic level",
    ", it is a mixture of the two extreme cases .",
    "this interpolation is distinct from the ones in which the circular law is progressively flattened on the real line with intermediate elliptic like support for the spectra @xcite .",
    "it reveals some of the rich characteristics of real random matrices due to their spectrum containing both real and complex eigenvalues .",
    "we now sketch the proof of the upper bound of the large deviations estimates :    we define @xmath294 the number of complex eigenvalues in @xmath295 . similarly to  @xcite , by a direct use of the joint pdf  , we find that the mass of a ball @xmath296 is : where @xmath297 the measure @xmath126 defined as : @xmath298 and the coefficient @xmath107 is such that @xmath108 .",
    "we hence have : @xmath299 allowing to conclude that : @xmath300 the first term in the right hand side converges towards a constant .",
    "the main difference with the proof of  @xcite is the fact that the right hand side of the inequality depends on @xmath5 . here , the sequence of real values @xmath301 is non - decreasing because of the inclusion property of the spaces @xmath64 .",
    "it is upper bounded by @xmath302 , and therefore converges towards this maximal value .",
    "this allows to conclude that : @xmath303 and by continuity of the map @xmath304 in the weak sense , we eventually have : @xmath305 \\leq   k + \\int_{{\\mathbb{c}}^2 } f_\\omega(z , z ' ) d{\\nu}(z)d{\\nu}(z').\\ ] ] our result follows by letting @xmath306 to infinity and using the monotone convergence theorem .",
    "an efficient method to approximate numerically the minimizer @xmath112 and the probability distribution of the proportion of real eigenvalues is to use the metropolis - hastings monte carlo algorithm .",
    "this method consists in constructing an ergodic markov chain whose stationary distribution is given by  . here",
    ", we evolve a @xmath5-particles system @xmath307 , but in contrast to the log - gas , the dynamics is now discrete , and the transition probability is based on the pdf  : a new configuration @xmath272 is drawn by modifying one of the eigenvalues at random and the markov chain has a transition towards @xmath272 if @xmath308 , and otherwise according to a bernoulli variable of parameter @xmath309 .",
    "when conditioning on very rare events , ( here for instance , a fixed number of real eigenvalues ) , cases satisfying the constraints have an extremely low probability of being explored , and more refined methods need to be developed in order to access these probabilities . in the present case ,",
