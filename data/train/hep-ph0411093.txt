    "the problem of dark matter ( dm ) of the universe was revealed about 70 years ago .",
    "several possible physical candidates were suggested since that time and several approaches to probe these candidates appeared .",
    "however , observed phenomena , which have unclear nature yet , could not be decisively matched with expected effects caused by existing candidates .",
    "an important step in exploration of dm problem was a development of direct searches for weakly interacting massive particles ( wimp ) .",
    "underground detectors were created in which effects of nucleus recoil induced by interaction of cosmic wimp with nucleus were searched for . a positive result at 6.3 sigma c.l .",
    "was obtained in the dama / nai underground set - up at the gran sasso national laboratory of i.n.f.n . by exploiting the distinctive wimp annual modulation signature @xcite .",
    "being model independent this positive result can not be directly compared with the single model - dependent negative results of other groups , which have also used different target - nuclei , different experimental strategies , different set - ups and all assumptions fixed at a single set @xcite .",
    "moreover , it can be shown @xcite that these negative results are actually not incompatible with the positive signal by dama / nai .",
    "on the other hand , an indirect probing of dm can be based on cosmic ray ( cr ) data .",
    "the presence of dm in galaxy in form of wimps can cause an appearance of cosmic particles of high energy due to an annihilation or decay of the wimps .",
    "an implication of these annihilation ( decay ) sources of cosmic rays could remove possible contradiction between observed cosmic ray fluxes and their predictions on the base of standard cosmic ray model .",
    "the result of dama / nai is a challenge for dm studies , expected to shed a light on the origin of dm .",
    "in fact , the existing physical candidates of dominant dm can hardly or not at all provide an explanation of the result of dama / nai .",
    "wimp candidates such as neutralino , axion , gravitino , sterile neutrino , axino , mirror ( shadow ) matter are able to compose all the required missing mass of the universe , however , all these candidates , except neutralino , are virtually sterile particles in respect to their interactions with an ordinary matter .",
    "therefore , it looks like the measurements of dama / nai as well as anomalies observed in cosmic rays spectra require a non - sterile dm which , in particular , could be a non - dominant dm component in the form of heavy neutrinos of the 4th generation @xcite .    a possibility to explain the dama / nai result within the framework of standard model extended to the 4th generation of fermions , revealed in @xcite , is the subject of current consideration .    the heavy neutrino ( @xmath11 ) is supposed to be a neutral fermion of a new 4th generation possessing the standard weak interaction .",
    "according to recent analysis of precision electroweak data@xcite , where possible virtual contributions of 4th generation particles were taken into account , a fit is compatible with the 4th neutrino , being dirac and ( quasi-)stable , in a mass range about 50 gev ( 47 - 50 gev is @xmath12 interval , 46.3 - 75 gev is @xmath13 interval ) @xcite and other 4th generation particles satisfying their direct experimental constraints ( above 80 - 130 gev ) . in the following",
    "we will assume that the 4th neutrino mass is about 50 gev .",
    "if the fourth neutrino is sufficiently long living or absolutely stable , its primordial gas from the early universe can survive to the present time and concentrate in the galaxy . in the case of charge symmetry of 4th generation particles",
    "the primordial 4th neutrinos can not account for a bulk of missing mass in the present universe . in the mass range about @xmath14",
    "gev the 4th neutrinos can make up @xmath15 of total density of the universe , being a non - dominant dm component .",
    "this leads to a scenario of multi component dark matter consisting of a subdominant heavy neutrino component and a sterile dominant component .",
    "a complex analysis of astrophysical effects induced by a presence of heavy neutrino ( non - sterile ) dm component is the purpose of present paper .",
    "it is worth noting that the 4th generation of quarks and leptons , considered here and neutralino , which is widely considered as the candidate for wimps , are naturally incorporated in the framework of heterotic string phenomenology .. it appeals to future multi - component dark matter analysis of the results of direct and indirect wimp searches .",
    "however , the astrophysical uncertainties revealed below even for the model of 4th generation neutrino , which is the simplest physical model and implies the minimal amount of parameters , demonstrate all the complications to be expected in such multi - component dark matter approach .",
    "we should remark that even if in principle the uhe neutrino of fourth family might produce a very exciting scattering with relic heavy neutrino ( a heavy - z - boson burst ) nevertheless the cosmic relic n are too diluted and poor in number to be anyway competitive with the much more abundant ( by @xmath16 order of magnitude ) and effective light neutrino @xcite scattering .",
    "so there is little consequence of any heavy - z - boson burst model interactions .",
    "the eventuality for a uhe neutrino ( produced , for instance in top - down models as @xcite ) to be a source of amplified resonant interaction with electron or quark ( as for susy uhe neutralino scattering into s - electron and s - quark channels @xcite ) is absent : there are not s - channel interaction able to overcome the electro - weak cross - sections but only much less effective t - channel processes . finally , the uhe n created by top - down models may nevertheless induce charged and neutral current interactions in neutrino detectors ( sk , uno,@xmath17 ) almost un - distinguishable from lighter uhe neutrino scattering in matter .",
    "this effect has just the ability to increase by a small factor ( @xmath18 ) the event rate in @xmath17 or euso neutrino induced events if top - down mechanism is the main source of uhecr .",
    "a contribution of heavy neutrinos @xmath19 to the total local density @xmath20 is given by a ratio @xmath21 approximately this parameter can be estimated as @xmath22 by assuming a dominance of cold dark matter ( cdm ) in the galaxy and by choosing the local fraction of relic heavy neutrinos equal to their contribution to the cosmological density of cdm .",
    "the results of dama / nai , based on measurements of an `` active '' dm component , i.e. in our assumptions on cosmic heavy neutrinos , give the fraction @xmath23 of heavy neutrinos in the local galactic density .",
    "heavy neutrinos interact with nuclei ( @xmath24 ) of dama / nai detector through the spin - independent coherent vector weak coupling .",
    "a spin - dependent axial weak coupling of neutrino and nuclei would contribute significantly within the considered mass range only if the corresponding wimp - nucleon cross section exceeds the spin - independent one by several orders of magnitude , what in general is not the case for the 4th neutrino .",
    "the value @xmath23 for heavy neutrinos is deduced from the result of dama / nai in term of @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the effective spin - independent wimp - nucleon cross - section @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the fermi constant , @xmath29 is the reduced mass of neutrino @xmath30 and nucleon ( @xmath31 gev ) , @xmath32 , @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 being numbers of protons and nucleons in nucleus respectively , @xmath36 is the weinberg angle .",
    "figure 1 shows a favorable region for heavy neutrinos of the 4th generation measured by dama and the fraction corresponding to a heavy neutrinos contribution to a local galactic density .",
    "the result of dama / nai takes into account existing uncertainties in dm distribution parameters , in form - factor of nuclei , and in the other experimental parameters @xcite .",
    "the fraction corresponding to a heavy neutrinos contribution was estimated by taking @xmath37 .",
    "note that the present work is based on the essentially updated dama / nai results in comparison with the previous works @xcite , @xcite .",
    "due to a concentration in galaxy heavy neutrinos can annihilate .",
    "the products of such annihilation contribute in cosmic ray fluxes and cosmic gamma radiation .",
    "observational data on cosmic positrons , antiprotons and gamma - radiation are sensitive to this contribution .",
    "an analysis of cosmic rays is complicated because a description of cr production and propagation contains significant uncertainties .",
    "observational data do not allow to choose parameters of physical models of cr in a unique way for cr origin ( injection spectra of each cr species ) and cr propagation ( diffusion coefficients and their energy dependence , parameters of convection , re - acceleration , magnetic halo parameters , matter distribution in galaxy , model of solar modulation etc . ) .",
    "recently a detailed study of cr models was performed in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .    in order to study effects of possible dm annihilation in galaxy ,",
    "it is reasonable to accept the most conservative cr model .",
    "eligible models should reproduce possible cr data which are the least sensitive to effects of wimp annihilation ( data on nuclear component of cr , its isotope composition ) .",
    "`` conventional model ( c ) '' in @xcite and `` diffusion re - acceleration model ( dr ) '' in @xcite are the most suitable .",
    "we will use in our consideration fluxes of secondary positrons , antiprotons and gamma - radiation predicted in these models as a `` background '' .",
    "dark matter annihilation sources will be included in these models to reproduce dm effects .",
    "an uncertainty in our analysis comes also from unknown distribution of subdominant heavy neutrino dm in the galaxy .",
    "there are many models of distribution of cdm in galaxy .",
    "we will use models for dominant dm , re - scaling a dark matter density in an appropriate way for a non - dominant heavy neutrino dm component . by fixing the density distribution of dm component in galaxy",
    "we relate the result of dama , sensitive to local density of dm , with results of cr analysis , sensitive to dm density distribution in solar neighborhood .    as a basic model for our estimations",
    "we select evan s halo model , which in @xcite was named as c2 .",
    "the values of parameters in this model are @xmath38 km / sec , @xmath39 gev/@xmath40 .",
    "density distribution of dm in galaxy is given by eq(41 ) of @xcite or eq(34 ) of @xcite with the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 kpc @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the radius in the galactic plane and the cylindrical coordinate axis perpendicular to it , @xmath46 is defined from a condition @xmath47 .    it is worth to note the chosen dm distribution is smooth and does not have a sharp profile near the galactic center ( gc ) .    also , to illustrate a dependence on a halo model choice , we will consider an isothermal halo model with a sharp behavior of density near gc .",
    "density distribution of the isothermal halo is given by @xmath48 with @xmath49 kpc , where @xmath44 is the distance from gc .",
    "note that the use of cuspy halo model , like navarro - frank - white model @xcite , leads to intermediate results .",
    "an excess of cosmic gamma - radiation observed by egret over predicted galactic @xmath50-emission , often called `` extragalactic '' @xmath50-background , can be considered as a possible effect of dark matter sources .",
    "a flux of cosmic gamma - radiation near the earth from annihilation of relic heavy neutrinos is defined by @xmath51 here @xmath52 is the product of cross section of @xmath53 annihilation and a relative velocity of neutrinos averaged over velocity distribution , @xmath54 is the number density of neutrinos in galaxy .",
    "an integration is performed along the line of sight with formally infinite upper limit , @xmath55 is the mean multiplicity of photons created in an act of annihilation for @xmath56 energy interval .",
    "the factor @xmath57 comes from the fact that the number densities of neutrinos and antineutrinos are equal to a half of their total number density @xmath58 . to obtain a distribution @xmath55 a code pythia 6.2 was used .",
    "figures 2 and 3 show @xmath50-fluxes at the earth from two directions : from the galactic center ( fig.2 ) and from a halo in the direction of galactic zenith ( fig.3 ) . corrected egret data for the halo were taken from @xcite , where egret data were re - analyzed in an advanced approach in which the galactic contribution was subtracted giving pure isotropic `` extragalactic '' @xmath50-radiation .",
    "dashed / solid lines in these figures show annihilation / annihilation plus background @xmath50-fluxes for neutrino mass ranging 47 - 80 gev .",

    "the low energy part of @xmath50-spectrum from halo ( fig.3 ) is not reproduced by annihilation of heavy neutrinos in the halo .",
    "however this low energy part can be explained by extragalactic emission based on a blazar population @xcite,@xcite .",
    "this emission is expected with a similar slope in spectra as data points exhibit .",
    "extraction of pure `` extragalactic '' @xmath50-flux in direction of galactic center ( gc ) is more complicated problem .",

    "the flux of charged particles from annihilation of heavy neutrinos in galaxy near the earth is defined by a diffusion of particles from @xmath53 annihilation to the region around the earth of the size as large as the characteristic diffusion length . for antiprotons , which do not experience significant energy loss , this region",
    "is determined by the size of halo where they are trapped by magnetic field .",
    "for positrons the size of region of dark matter annihilation sources contributing to a flux near the earth depends on energy loss of positrons .",
    "this does not allow positrons , created with an energy @xmath62 , to come with energy @xmath63 from distance strongly exceeding @xmath64 here @xmath65 is the diffusion coefficient which is energy ( rigidity ) dependent , @xmath66 is the rate of energy loss defined as @xmath67 charged cosmic particles experience a solar modulation . to take into account this effect",
    "we will use force - field model @xcite . in this approximation the intensity measured at the top of the earth s atmosphere ( inner heliosphere ) at the energy @xmath68 corresponds to a local interstellar ( lis ) intensity ( outer heliosphere ) through the relation @xmath69 here @xmath70 is the mass of cosmic particle , @xmath71 is the energy lost by the cosmic particles during their travel in the heliosphere .",

    "it is shown in @xcite this dependence during nineties ( positive half - cycle of the sun ) broke the force - field approximation for description of data on negatively charged particles ( electrons , antiprotons ) in low energy range . whereas positively charged particles were well described by the force - field model in that period .",
    "we will use data on cosmic positrons and antiprotons transformed into lis by eq(8 ) , what will lead to some underestimation of lis antiproton flux at low energy .",
    "note that the energy scale of modulation is detemnined by @xmath71 , being around @xmath72gev , and for @xmath73 gev effect of modulation is negligible .    for an estimation of positron flux from @xmath53 annihilation we adopted the diffusion approximation of positron propagation in galaxy without inclusion of the effect of diffusion zone boundaries @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that a strong energy loss of high energy cosmic @xmath74 makes their spectra dependent on the space distribution of density of @xmath74-sources .",

    "such parameters ( eq(9 - 10 ) ) allow positrons originated as far as at gc to contribute to the flux near the earth .",

    "can be referred to non - dominating heavy neutrinos dm assuming the minimal clump mass to be @xmath101 @xmath115 note , that fig.1 implies some deviation from such proportionality within a factor 1 - 100 at @xmath97 gev for an average local density ( which is deduced from dynamical observation to be within 0.17 - 1.7 gev/@xmath40 ) , if real local density ( in vicinity of the earth ) does not differ significantly from the average one .",
    "additional contribution into an enhancement of the neutrino annihilation rate will result from the clumps with a mass in the range @xmath116 .",
    "the enhancement from these clumps can be roughly estimated as a corresponding estimation in @xcite for @xmath107 reduced with respect to smaller relative compression of heavy neutrino density inside the given clumps as compared to that of dominant dm . in each such clump the relative compression of neutrino density , i.e. the ratio of densities inside a clump and outside it ( of homogeneous component near the clump ) , should be smaller than that of dominant component of matter ( cdm ) in accordance with @xcite @xmath117 as a first approximation we neglect details ( differences ) of density distributions of dominant component and heavy neutrinos inside these clumps .",
    "so , the factor @xmath118 is determined by squared ratio of densities above both for heavy neutrinos and for cdm . the enhancement factor for heavy neutrinos for a clump mass between @xmath107 and @xmath101",
    "can be estimated as @xmath119 where @xmath114 is the enhancement factor as predicted in @xcite ( for dominant dm component ) .",
    "factor @xmath118 increases with a decrease of clump mass @xcite , so a contribution from the clumps of mass @xmath109 , which are relatively less populated by heavy neutrinos , can be comparable with those of mass @xmath110 .",
    "for instance , for an index of primeval perturbation spectrum @xmath120 , index of power - like density distribution inside the clump @xmath121 at @xmath122 we have @xmath123 ( see fig.5 of @xcite ) , and assuming @xmath124 we obtain @xmath125 . for essentially smaller values of @xmath107 the contribution from clumps with @xmath109 is turned out to prevail .",
    "a density parameter @xmath23 should decrease as a square root of enhancement factor @xmath126 , so in example above we get @xmath23 by a factor 5 less at 50 gev than it is in fig.6 . for other values of neutrino mass of interest",
    "the result is virtually the same .",
    "an agreement between measurement of dama / nai and cr observation data is possible for the hypothesis of 4th neutrino with evan s halo model within allowed neutrino mass range below 50 gev ( see fig.7 ) .",
    "note that in our approximation we did not pay attention to a correction for given quantitative estimations of an effect of clumps due to a different dm density distribution in galaxy ( evan s ) than it was supposed in @xcite . also note , that a destruction of clumps near gc @xcite should partially decrease the enhancement of annihilation @xmath50-flux from gc due to clumps . this may improve agreement between results for photons from gc and the halo .    in the case",
    "if a minimal possible dm clump mass , @xmath107 , is greater than @xmath101 ( there is only a unique mass range ) , then the enhancement factor would be given by eq(13 ) with @xmath107 instead of @xmath101 .",
    "an annihilation signal as a signature of existence of dm particles like heavy neutrinos implies a condition of the presence of both particles and antiparticles . the case considered in the present article",
    "was based on an assumption of charge symmetry of 4th generation particles , i.e. an equality between the numbers of primordial 4th neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "such a statement can find physical foundation in superstring models .",
    "new charge(s ) is(are ) predicted there which , being strictly conserved , can be ascribed only to 4th generation particles @xcite .",
    "it accounts for absolute stability of the lightest particle bearing this charge ( assumed to be the 4th neutrino ) and an equality between particles and antiparticles of a new generation .",
    "an important consequence of a new charge is an effect of new interaction . in a wide class of models",
    "this charge is @xmath127-gauge charge which leads to existence of corresponding massless gauge bosons ( @xmath128-photons ) and to a coulomb - like interaction of 4th neutrinos .",
    "it was revealed in @xcite , that this new interaction does not influence significantly the results of 4th neutrino freezing out in early universe , but it can increase their annihilation signal in galaxy by a few hundred times .",
    "the matter is that in the considered range of neutrino masses ordinary electroweak @xmath129-bozon resonance annihilation channel dominates over the new channel of 2@xmath128annihilation and the main effect of new interaction is coulomb - like factor in the cross sections of slow charged particles .",
    "such factor , @xmath130 , first deduced by a.sakharov @xcite for coulomb interaction of slow electrically charged particles , in the case of coulomb - like interaction with `` fine structure constant '' @xmath131 has the form @xcite @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the speed of light and @xmath134 is the relative velocity of charged particles . at @xmath135 , what is the case for the period of 4th neutrino freezing out in the early unvierse ,",
    "this factor is close to 1 , but for @xmath136 , being the case for neutrinos in galaxy , it increases their annihilation rate by the factor of sakharov s enhancement @xcite @xmath137    it would provide a decrease of predicted the best - fit @xmath23 parameters as square root of that enhancement * ( being properly averaged over velocity distribution ) . *",
    "the account for this new coulomb - like interaction , possessed by 4th neutrinos , extends the possibility of unified explanation of cr and dama / nai data in the framework of 4th neutrino hypothesis for the most part of considered interval of neutrino masses .",
    "figure 8 corresponds to the case of @xmath138 , which is the most natural value for this coupling constant .",
    "the case of clumpiness of heavy neutrinos with new interaction , while being possible , is more complex and involves both factors ( @xmath118 and @xmath139 ) .",
    "its combined role will offer more tunable scenarios ; however for sake of simplicity we wil not take it into account here .    on the first sight sakharov s enhancement does not influence the annihilation rate of accumulated 4th neutrinos inside the earth and sun , which is defined by their capture rate .",
    "however , the existence of stable quark of 4th generation can make the picture more complicated .",
    "being compatible @xcite with the constraints on the abundance of anomalous isotopes , the presence of small amount of anomalous hadrons , containing this quark ( or antiquark ) and possessing the @xmath127-gauge charge can cause asymmetry in capture rates for 4th neutrino and antineutrino and thus influence their annihilation rate in earth and sun .",
    "a role of this gauge interaction , its charges and field in effects of heavy neutrinos as well as the account of possible existence of stable 4th generation hadrons requires a separate discussion .",
    "if neutrinos of 4th generation do not possess new @xmath127-gauge charge , there does not appear any fundamental reason for their absolute stability as well as for their strict charge symmetry .",
    "if charge symmetry is absent , which is the case for baryons in the universe , the 4th neutrinos would prevail over their antineutrinos ( or vise versa ) and they could decay .",
    "a magnitude of this asymmetry , being defined as the ratio of difference of present number densities of 4th neutrinos and 4th antineutrinos ( @xmath140 ) and present relic photon number density , is an additional parameter of the problem .",
    "this parameter should be much less than that of baryons in order not to exceed an essentially relative contribution of 4th neutrino into the density of cdm derived from measurements of dama ( fig.1 ) .",
    "a difference @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the relic heavy neutrino density in the case of charge symmetry , leads to an increase of relic 4th neutrino density by a few times and to an exponential decrease of density of relic 4th antineutrinos by a few orders of magnitude .",
    "as seen in fig.1 this would be especially favored for neutrino mass around 50 gev .",
    "if relic neutrinos survive to present time , their annihilation signals from galaxy and from the earth and sun weaken by a few orders of magnitude as compared to the symmetric case .",
    "however , in the asymmetric case another signature of 4th neutrino dm in cr is possible .",
    "neutrinos of 4th generation are unstable in this case and their decays in the galactic halo can lead to effects similar to the ones from stable neutrino annihilation . in this case cr data can be reproduced , if 4th neutrino decay lifetime is , for evan s density distribution , @xmath143 here @xmath23 is the local density fraction of neutrinos in charge asymmetric case .",
    "the value of the decay rate preferable for cr data changes weakly with variation of neutrino mass ( since it is defined by the observed cr fluxes ) , so uncertainty 0.2 - 2 in estimation ( [ unutime ] ) is mainly induced by uncertainty of best - fit @xmath23 parameters deduced from data of different cr species ( for evan s halo model ) .",
    "note that there is a difference by a factor 2 in energy release for annihilation reaction and decay process .",
    "but in the numerical estimations for the effects of decay the predictions for cr fluxes , induced by neutrino annihilation , can be used without significant change with only proper account for the change in the energy release , provided that hadron modes are present in decay with sufficient probability .",
    "parameter @xmath144 would provide for neutrino of mass about 47 - 70 gev with the lifetime given above an agreement between the measurement of dama / nai and cr data .",
    "so , preferable lifetime of 4th neutrino is @xmath145 years .",
    "note , that clumpiness does not affect the fluxes of products of heavy neutrino decay in the galaxy .",
    "also note , that the annihilation rate of neutrinos accumulated inside the earth and sun in the symmetric case corresponds to a timescale less than the age of solar system ( much less in case of the sun ) .",
    "so the decay rate with the lifetime above ( [ unutime ] ) is strongly suppressed as compared to a corresponding annihilation rate for the symmetric case .",
    "in the present work it was shown that the positive result at 6.3 sigma c.l . obtained in dama / nai and observed possible excesses in cosmic gamma - radiation , positrons and antiprotons can be in agreement within the framework of hypothesis of a 4th neutrino mass hidden nearby half the z - boson mass .",
    "the evident advantage of this hypothesis is the minimal number of physical parameters . in the simplest case",
    "it is only the mass of neutrino ( to be compared with minimally 5 parameters in the case of susy dark matter ) .    but even in this simplest case we have revealed the complex model dependence on the galactic mass distribution and cosmic ray diffusion .",
    "we have shown its compatibility within realistic values of heavy neutrino mass .",
    "the model may be naturally extended in the case of in - homogeneous ( clumpy ) galactic halo , new heavy neutrino interactions related to its necessary stability , relic neutrino asymmetry and it consequent unstability and decay . in those models there",
    "are room for better agreement between underground and cosmic rays signals .",
    "the lightest neutrino masses ( @xmath146 gev ) might be searched inside the old lep data regarding electron pair annihilations into one photon with missing energy @xcite ; the largest ones ( @xmath147 gev ) might be discovered by near future lhc search of invisible higgs boson decay@xcite .",
    "additional satellites and antimatter search in space might define the exact parameter range for this extension of the lepton sector , whose existence might be tested also in the search for a novel pair of 4th quark family@xcite .",
