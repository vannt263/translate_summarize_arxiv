    "the coming years will witness the emergence of a new generation of ground - based and space - born mm / sub - mm telescopes with sensitivities and frequency coverage that will allow us to study the interstellar medium ( ism ) in high-@xmath5 proto - galaxies in unprecedented detail .",
    "unfortunately , our expectations of how such objects will look in mm / sub - mm line emission are ill - informed due to the dearth of similar data locally .",
    "virtually all studies of local ( u)lirgs to date have been of low-@xmath3 co transitions or of single hcn / hco@xmath2 lines , and as a result we know very little about the properties of their dense , star - forming gas phase . while pioneering multi - line studies of low - intensity starbursts taught us the value of having many independent dense gas tracers ( nguyen - q - rieu et al .",
    "1992 ; jackson et al .  1995 ; paglione , jackson & ishizuki 1997 ) , the relatively benign star formation rates of such galaxies suggest they may not be optimal guides for the state of the ism in ( u)lirgs and high-@xmath5 starbursts . in the local universe , arp220 and",
    "ngc6240 are ideally suited for studies of the dense gas in extreme starburst galaxies as they have the most well - sampled fir / sub - mm spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of their category ( dopita et al .",
    "2005 ) and a large number of rotational lines of co  and some of hcn , cs and hco@xmath2  have already been observed . with this in mind , we used the 15-m james clerk maxwell telescope and the iram 30-m telescope , to observe hcn , cs , and hco@xmath2 molecular line emission towards these two sources ( greve et al .",
    "the final tally of high - density tracers observed is cs 21 , 32 , 54 , 76 ( arp220 only ) , hcn 10 , 32 , 43 , and hco@xmath2 10 , 32 , 43 . employing a large velocity gradient ( lvg ) to model the line ratios from each molecular species",
    ", we find that while hco@xmath2 , hcn , and cs all trace what in broad terms can be characterized as dense gas ( @xmath6 ) , the individual solutions point toward significantly different densities .",
    "_ in fact , we find that the cs emission emerges from gas with a density 10@xmath7 higher than what is derived from the hcn line ratios , and 100@xmath7 denser than the hco@xmath2 emitting gas .",
    "_ this is consistent with galactic surveys of cs lines , which have shown them to be unmistakable markers of very dense , high - mass star forming cores ( plume et al .",
    "1997 ; shirley et al .",
    "2003 ) , while hco@xmath2 with its smaller critical density is expected to trace less dense gas than both cs and hcn .",
    "thus , our findings strongly suggest that the recent claims that hco@xmath2 is a better tracer of the dense gas in ( u)lirgs ( graci - carpio et al .",
    "2006 ) does not hold in arp220 and ngc6240 .",
    "the temperature constraints provided by the three lvg solutions are remarkably similar ( @xmath8k ) .",
    "this may indicate that hco@xmath2 , hcn , and cs all trace the star forming part of the molecular gas reservoir , especially since the @xmath9-values are rather high , which could be due to the proximity of the gas phase probed to the star formation sites in both galaxies .    assuming the dense gas resides in virialized and optically thick ( in hcn 10 ) clouds , the associated total gas mass is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the hcn 10 line luminosity , and @xmath12 is the hcn - to - h@xmath13 conversion factor ( e.g.  radford , solomon & downes 1991 ) and is estimated from the best - fit lvg solution to the hcn line ratios . in a similar fashion",
    ", we can derive conversion factors and dense gas masses appropriate for hco@xmath2 and cs . combining the dense gas mass estimates obtained in this way , we find @xmath14 and @xmath15 for arp220 and ngc6240 , respectively .",
    "thus in both systems we find a remarkably narrow range in dense gas mass estimates and , given our strong constraints on the dense gas properties , they are likely to be amongst the most accurate ever obtained for any ( u)lirg . while consistent with dynamical estimates of the total mass , such large dense gas masses strongly suggest that the bulk of the total gas reservoir in arp220 and ngc6240 is in the dense phase  consistent with the notion that most of their ir luminosities are powered by star formation .",
    "evidence from galactic observations points to a common gas phase being responsible for the hcn and high-@xmath3 co line emission .",
    "this is indeed expected , as such a gas phase is intimately linked with ongoing star formation , so its warm and dense conditions are able to excite hcn , cs , hco@xmath2 as well as the high-@xmath3 co transitions . if this correlation between the high-@xmath3 co and hcn , cs , hco@xmath2 line emission is verified for ( u)lirgs in general , future ground - based large aperture telescopes ( alma , ccat , lmt ) will be able to capitalize from it , as it offers a more accessible observational window to the dense star forming molecular gas in galaxies , with the latter lines being much easier to observe than the high-@xmath3 co lines whose emission at @xmath16ghz is severely attenuated by the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the hi - fi instrument ( de graauw et al .  1998 ) onboard herschel should allow us to investigate whether the aforementioned concomitance of molecular line emission is widespread amongst starburst and ( u)lirgs .",
    "we have therefore used our constraints on the dense gas properties in arp220 and ngc6240 to predict the line fluxes of these transitions and the extent hi - fi will be able to detect these lines in ( u)lirgs at various redshifts ( fig .  [",
    "figure : predictions ] ) . for",
    "( u)lirgs in the redshift range @xmath17 , herschel / hi - fi will complement ground - based ( sub)mm facilities for which currently only the low-@xmath3 lines are accessible and thereby virtually complete the full rotational @xmath3-ladder for a number of important molecules in such systems . not only",
    "will this allow for a full inventory of the molecular ism in luminous starbursts and ( u)lirgs , but it will also provide us with a valuable data - base of low-@xmath5 templates with which to interpret the high-@xmath3 detections in extremely distant galaxies ( @xmath18 ) that alma will produce . characterizing these transitions relative to the lower ones for the local extreme starburst population  similar to the need of understanding local dust seds before interpreting the single - frequency detections of dust continuum in high-@xmath5 galaxies  will prove to be extremely valuable before embarking on the high-@xmath3 , high-@xmath5 ventures with alma .",
