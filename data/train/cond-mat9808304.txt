    "metal crystals in the body - centered tetragonal structure are known to have two total - energy minima as functions of tetragonal lattice constants @xmath0 and @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the minima are appropriately called equilibrium metallic phases , since they persist without applied stress and are stable under small tetragonal deformations . previous work by the authors  @xcite defined and discussed epitaxial bain paths ( ebp ) , which are sequences of tetragonal states that include the equilibrium tetragonal phases .",
    "these paths give the strained tetragonal states produced by isotropic epitaxial strain , i.e. , isotropic two - dimensional biaxial or in - plane strain , imposed on the ( 001 ) planes of the equilibrium phases . in the previous work the ebp for v , co , and cu",
    "were found using first - principles total - energy calculations and the ebp were compared with the paths produced by _",
    "stress on the phases , which were called in that work uniaxial bain paths .",
    "the ebp were shown to be directly useful in interpreting the bulk structure of epitaxial films determined , for example , by quantitative low - energy electron diffraction ( qleed ) .",
    "comparison of the measured structure of a film with the states on the ebp identifies the phase from which the film is produced by the epitaxial strain .",
    "thus a film of co on cu(001 ) was shown to be strained fcc co , but a film of co on fe(001 ) was shown to be strained body - centered tetragonal ( bct ) co , a metastable phase of co , whereas bcc co was shown to be unstable .    in the tetragonal plane ,",
    "whose coordinates are tetragonal lattice constants , the ebp is a continuous path that passes through the two phase points at the energy minima and through the saddle point of energy between the two minima .",
    "it was shown that between the minima a segment of the ebp exists which includes the saddle point , but not the minima , that consists of inherently unstable states .",
    "more generally , strained states of each phase , not just those on the ebp , were shown to be separated by a region of inherently unstable tetragonal states , so that an observed strained tetragonal state has a connection to just one equilibrium phase through stable but constrained states .",
    "the present work gives the ebp for six metals based on the published first - principles calculations for tetragonal structures by sliwko , mohn , schwarz and blaha  @xcite .",
    "the calculation procedures for finding the ebp , the contours of constant energy and the unstable region are described in sec.ii .",
    "the results are described in sec.iii with two tables and four figures .",
    "section iv discusses why the ebp is useful , the significance of the unstable region , and notes defects and generalizations of these calculations .",
    "the calculations of total energy @xmath2 . as a function of the tetragonal lattice parameters @xmath0 , the side of the square cross section , and @xmath1 , the height of the unit cell , used the power - series expansions given in ref.@xcite , whereas the calculations in ref.@xcite used the full - potential apw program wien95 directly .",
    "the power - series expansions were fitted in ref.@xcite to extensive first - principles calculations in the local - density approximation ( lda ) with wien95 .",
    "the expansions give @xmath2 within specified ranges of @xmath3 and volume per atom @xmath4 that include the minima and saddle point and have the form @xmath5 the coefficients @xmath6 are tabulated in ref.@xcite to eight significant figures and are available in electronic form from the authors . in eq.([eq1 ] ) @xmath7 is @xmath8 or @xmath9 , @xmath10 is @xmath11 and @xmath2 is obtained in the specified ranges to an accuracy stated to be better than @xmath12 mry  @xcite . some comments on this stated accuracy are made in sec.iv .",
    "a useful feature of the formula ( 1 ) is that analytical formulas for the first and second derivatives of @xmath2 may be readily derived .",
    "the ebp for each metal is found by calculating @xmath2 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 as a function of @xmath1 at constant @xmath0 , and locating the @xmath1 value for which @xmath2 has a minimum or , equivalently , locating the zero of @xmath13 .",
    "the minimum corresponds to the epitaxial film condition of zero normal stress on the ( 001 ) surface .",
    "as @xmath0 ranges over the structures between the phase points , the ebp is traced by these minima of @xmath2 at each @xmath0 . since",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath13 are evaluated easily , a dense grid of @xmath1 values permits simple interpolation to four significant figures for @xmath1,@xmath2 , and @xmath14 at the minimum of @xmath2 for any @xmath0 .",
    "the two phase points and the saddle point correspond to stationary points for @xmath2 , hence are located by interpolating on the ebp itself to find points where @xmath14 vanishes along with @xmath13 .",
    "two of the three stationary points are always cubic points , since at a cubic point if @xmath15 then also @xmath16 . the contours of constant @xmath2 are similarly found by interpolating the desired @xmath2 in a tabulation of @xmath17 at values of @xmath0 over a range of @xmath0 that covers the desired contour .",
    "tetragonal elastic constants at any @xmath0 and @xmath1 may be defined by    @xmath18    the @xmath19 differ from the usual elastic stiffness coefficients @xmath20 because the @xmath19 correspond to tetragonal deformations which maintain the square symmetry @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "to separate @xmath22 from @xmath23 requires breaking tetragonal symmetry , but is not possible if @xmath2 is known only from the power series ( 1 ) .",
    "however when the phase has cubic symmetry @xmath24 and @xmath23 can be evaluated .",
    "in fact : @xmath23 can be evaluated in two ways , i.e. , from @xmath25 and @xmath26 on the one hand , and from @xmath27 on the other hand .",
    "the correspondence of the two values is then a test of the accuracy of the power series representation of @xmath2 as will be noted in sec.iv .",
    "a strained tetragonal state will in general be maintained by applied in - plane and out - of - plane stresses determined by the derivatives @xmath14 and @xmath28 .",
    "however stability depends also on a condition on the second derivatives of @xmath2 which states that the second - order differential of @xmath2 is always positive , i.e. , that @xmath29\\ ] ] is greater than zero for all deformations @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "otherwise the structure would have a tetragonal deformation that lowers the energy , so that the structure can not be maintained by applied stresses .",
    "the condition @xmath32 is then a condition on the @xmath19 , namely , @xmath33 the lines along which @xmath34 can be calculated readily by finding the @xmath3 at which @xmath34 for the function @xmath35 at constant @xmath36 and using a range of @xmath36 to follow the line ; the analytical power series for the second derivatives of @xmath2 .",
    "obtained from ( 1 ) are convenient for the calculation .",
    "the slope of the ebp at the phase points can be expressed directly in terms of the elastic constants of each tetragonal or cubic phase , volume @xmath37 , @xmath38 if the phase point has cubic symmetry , eq.([eq5 ] ) simplifies , since then @xmath24 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the poisson ratio of the cubic phase , @xmath42 . in the figures @xmath43",
    "is chosen as the volume of the equilibrium phase of lower @xmath2 , hence eq.([eq5 ] ) or eq.([eq6 ] ) applied to the other equilibrium phase has a factor of the ratio of the @xmath36 of the other phase to @xmath43 on the right sides of eq.([eq5 ] ) and eq.([eq6 ] ) to get the slope of the plotted ebp .",
    "equations ( [ eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) relate the linear elastic approximation to the ebp of a phase directly to the elastic constants for a tetragonal noncubic phase or a cubic phase respectively .",
    "if the elastic constants of the phase are known from experiment or theory , the equations give the linear approximation to the ebp .",
    "then the measured bulk structure of a strained epitaxial film can be compared with the linear ebp to identify the equilibrium phase of that film .",
    "this identification is especially interesting for noncubic tetragonal phases , which are predicted to exist for all transition elements  @xcite , but are always metastable .",
    "hence they can not be made macroscopically , but may be stabilized by epitaxy , as was done in the case of bct co  @xcite .",
    "comparison of eq.([eq5 ] ) with eq.([eq6 ] ) shows that eq.([eq5 ] ) defines an effective poisson ratio for tetragonal phases .",
    "the results of calculation with the procedures and formulas of sec.ii are given in four figures and two tables .",
    "figures 1 to 3 plot the ebp of v , ti , and sr along with contours of constant @xmath2 on the @xmath44 tetragonal plane , where @xmath43 is the volume per atom of the more stable phase point ; the positions of the two phase points and the saddle point are marked .",
    "the composite fig.4 plots the ebp of rb , li , and k without the contour lines . the corresponding coordinates and the energy at each point referred to a zero at the more stable phase are given in table i. plotted in figs.1 , 2 and 3 are five contours of constant energy , i.e. , two contours at @xmath45 above the two minima , the contours through the saddle point , and the contours @xmath45 above and below the saddle - point energy .",
    "the values chosen for @xmath45 depend on the energy scale for each metal .",
    "the unstable region where @xmath46 , which includes the saddle point , is the region between the two lines of long dashes , and is shown in all four figures .",
    "table i also gives the stationary points of @xmath2 for tetragonal rb computed by milstein , marschall and fang  @xcite from an empirical potential fitted to experiment .",
    "ebp for v on the @xmath44 plane ( full line ) , phase point 1 bcc ( full circle ) , volume @xmath47 , @xmath48 ; saddle point fcc ( marked @xmath49 ) @xmath50 mry ; phase point 2 bct ( full circle ) , @xmath51 mry .",
    "energy contours are drawn ( short dashes ) at @xmath52 mry above the minima , through the saddle point and @xmath53 from the saddle point .",
    "the unstable region is between the lines of long dashes and includes the saddle point .",
    "the coordinates for the phase and saddle points are in table i. [ fig1 ]    the tetragonal elastic stiffness constants @xmath25 , @xmath27 , @xmath26 are given in table ii at the phase points and also the elastic stiffness constants found in ref.@xcite for the cubic phases of each metal .",
    "when the phase is cubic , the usual tetragonal elastic constants @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( found in two ways ) are given ; note that then @xmath54 . by symmetry , @xmath2 is stationary at the cubic points @xmath55 on the ebp , i.e. , @xmath56 at cubic points .",
    "however the cubic points can be saddle points as well as minima .",
    "the possible configurations have been classified in ref.@xcite in three cases , i.e. , case 1 : minimum at bcc ( @xmath57 ) , saddle point at @xmath58 , and minimum at fcc ( @xmath59 ) ; case 2 : minimum at bct ( @xmath60 ) , saddle point at bcc ( @xmath57 ) , minimum at fcc ( @xmath61 ) ; case 3 : minimum at bcc ( @xmath57 ) , saddle point at fcc ( @xmath61 ) , minimum at bct ( @xmath62 ) . then rb , k , li , sr are case 1 , ti is case 2 and v is case 3 .",

    "[ fig4 ]    for cubic symmetry @xmath84 vanishes ; even for the bct phases of ti and v , @xmath84 is much smaller than @xmath85 and @xmath86 , so the contours are still nearly vertical .",
    "formula ( 7 ) for the case of cubic symmetry with coefficients in terms of the @xmath20 is given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the principal result found here is the ebp between the phase points , which shows the effects of isotropic epitaxial strain on equilibrium phases .",
    "the ebp provides a basic elastic response of a material in tetragonal structure to a particular strain , one which is available experimentally , including the interesting case of negative strain in the plane .",
    "the ebp are found here from first principles in a well - defined approximation with errors of known magnitude , and include nonlinear effects .",
    "these ebp can then be compared directly with the strained bulk structures determined by qleed for epitaxial films .",
    "this comparison is illustrated for strained epitaxial ti films on al(001 )  @xcite , where the qleed point and its error limits ( from the uncertainty in the bulk value of @xmath1 ) are shown in fig . 2 to agree well with the calculated ebp .",
    "the @xmath43 used in evaluating @xmath87 for the qleed point is the measured hcp ti value , @xmath88 which is close to the fcc value .",
    "the presence on the ebp of an inherently unstable section separating strained fcc ti from strained bct ti is an important result of the theory .",
    "since the qleed point within its error limit lies on the fcc part of the ebp , the epitaxial film must be strained fcc ti .",
    "this result is particularly interesting because fcc ti does not appear on the usual pressure - temperature phase diagram .",
    "note that the theory gives directly the possible states of epitaxially - strained fcc ti , including any nonlinear elastic behavior of the crystalline phases .",
    "this comparison of measured structure with the theoretical ebp replaces the previous analysis , which assumed constant elastic stiffness coefficients and attempted to estimate the elastic coefficients of the cubic phases  @xcite .",
    "the use of linear elastic relations for identification of the equilibrium phase is compared to the use of the ebp for that identification in the case of co in ref.@xcite , where tetragonal states and the ebp are plotted on the @xmath89 plane , where @xmath90 is the layer spacing .",
    "these first - principles calculations , which do not use empirical information , have an advantage over empirical potentials fitted to measurements , since these calculations are as good for highly strained or even unstable states , which are not accessible to measurement , as they are for slightly strained equilibrium states .",
    "thus they provide a test of calculations based on empirical potentials , such as the potential used for rb in ref.@xcite .",
    "comparison in table i shows that the @xmath3 values of the saddle point differ by @xmath91 , that the minimum energy in ref.@xcite is at the bcc structure , rather than the fcc structure found here , and that the energy separation of the equilibrium phases in ref.@xcite has both a sign and a magnitude different ( smaller ) from what is calculated here .",
    "the power series representation of the tetragonal energies shows some defects , e.g. , the cubic points deviate from @xmath57 or @xmath92 . in table",
    "i , the two values of @xmath23 do not agree well in some cases .",
    "these defects are in the representation of the results of lda calculations .",
    "the most serious defect is in the saddle point of ti , which is bcc , but the power series finds the saddle point at @xmath93 rather than @xmath94 .",
    "a recalculation of the energy @xmath2 of ti directly with ` wien95 ` finds that the power series has missed an asymmetry in @xmath2 around the saddle point which shifts the position of the maximum .",
    "the direct calculation finds the maximum at @xmath57 as it should be ; it also verifies the minimum of fcc ti at @xmath95 .",
    "the deviation from symmetry at fcc ti and all other cubic phases is thus no more than @xmath96 , except for fcc rb , where the deviation is @xmath97 . in comparison with experiment",
    "all the calculated elastic stiffness coefficients are too large by at least @xmath91 and the volumes per atom are too small by @xmath8 to @xmath91 .",
    "these discrepancies from experiment are defects of the assumptions of the band calculations , i.e. , of the lda with semi - relativistic corrections .        2 despite the deviations from experiment , which may be reduced in subsequent calculations by more accurate formulation of the electronic structure equations , these results are of immediate practical value in interpreting measured film structures , and of conceptual value in providing a sharp distinction between , for example , a tetragonally strained bcc phase and a tetragonally strained fcc phase .",
    "a generalization of the tetragonal results to other structures suggests a new type ofphase diagram in which the various equilibrium phases , stable and metastable , are points in a parameter space which has structural parameters as coordinates .",
    "the present results suggest that each phase point is surrounded by a region of strained states and the regions are embedded in and separated by a continuous matrix of inherently unstable states that can not be stabilized by applied stresses .",
    "such a generalization for structures with considerable symmetry , such as the tetragonal structure , seems calculable by present codes .",
    "thanks are due to m. scheffler of the fritz - haber institute for discussion and encouragement and to k. schwarz and p. mohn of the technical university of vienna for information about their energy calculations .            the coefficient @xmath98 for ti in ref.@xcite should read @xmath99 instead of @xmath100 p.  mohn ( private communication ) .",
    "reference  3 also includes eight - figure coefficients for ca , but eleven figures in the coefficients are needed to get accurate results ; they can be obtained from the authors of ref.@xcite .    the relations between the @xmath19 and the @xmath20 in eq.([eq2 ] ) are derived by comparing second derivatives of @xmath2 obtained in two ways .",
    "one way uses eq.([eq2 ] ) and treats @xmath2 as a function of the two variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the second way treats @xmath2 as a function of three orthogonal variables @xmath101 and @xmath102 the two in - plane lattice constants , and @xmath1 , the out - of - plane lattice constant , and takes second derivatives with respect to @xmath101 or @xmath102 or the mixed second derivative with respect to @xmath101 and to @xmath1 , all at @xmath103 .",
