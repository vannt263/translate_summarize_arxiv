    "these notes are an introduction to factorization algebras and factorization homology in the context of topological spaces and manifolds .",
    "the origin of factorization algebras and factorization homology , as defined by lurie  @xcite and costello - gwilliam  @xcite , are to be found in topological quantum field theories and conformal field theories .",
    "indeed , they were largely motivated and influenced by the pioneering work of beilinson - drinfeld  @xcite and also of segal  @xcite . _ factorization homology _ is a catchword to describe homology theories _ specific _ to say oriented manifolds of a fixed dimension @xmath1 .",
    "there are also variant specific to many other classes of structured manifold of fixed dimension .",
    "typically the structure in question would be a framing or a spin structure or simply no structure at all .",
    "_ factorization algebras _ are algebraic structures which shed many similarities with ( co)sheaves and were introduced to describe quantum field theories much in the same way as the structure of a manifold or scheme is described by its sheaf of functions  @xcite .",
    "they are related to factorization homology in the same way as singular cohomology is related to sheaf cohomology .    unlike classical singular homology for which any abelian group can be used as coefficient of the theory , in order to define factorization homology , one needs a more complicated piece of algebraic data : that of an @xmath0-algebra - algebras are the piece of data needed in the case of framed manifolds . for other structured manifolds",
    ", one needs @xmath0-algebras equipped with additional structure ; for instance an invariance under their natural @xmath2-action in the oriented manifold case ] .",
    "these algebras have been heavily studied in algebraic topology ever since the seventies where they were introduced to study iterated loop spaces and configuration spaces  @xcite .",
    "they have been proved to also have deep significance in mathematical physics  @xcite , string topology  @xcite and ( derived ) algebraic geometry  @xcite .",
    "@xmath3-algebras are essentially the same thing as @xmath4-algebras , that is homotopy associative algebras . on the other hand , @xmath5-algebras are homotopy commutative algebras . in general",
    "the @xmath0- structures form a hierarchy of more and more homotopy commutative algebra structures .",
    "in fact , an @xmath0-algebra is an homotopy associative algebra whose multiplication @xmath6 is commutative up to an homotopy operator @xmath7 .",
    "this operator is itself commutative up to an homotopy operator @xmath8 and so on up to @xmath9 which is no longer required to be homotopy commutative .    since factorization homology depends on ( some class of ) both manifold and @xmath0-algebra , they also give rise to invariant of @xmath0-algebras .",
    "these invariants have proven useful as we illustrate in   [ s : applications ] .",
    "for instance , in dimension @xmath10 , factorization homology evaluated on a circle is the usual hochschild homology of algebras ( together with its circle action inducing cyclic homology as well ) . for @xmath11 ,",
    "factorization homology gives rise to an invariant of topological spaces ( sometimes called higher hochschild homology  @xcite ) which we recall in    [ s : comalgebracase ] .",
    "it is easier to study and interesting in its own since it is closely related to mapping spaces , their derived analogues and observables of classical topological field theories .",
    "we give the precise axioms of homology theory of manifolds in ",
    "[ s : homologytheorymfld ] .",
    "factorization homology can be computed using ech complexes of factorization algebras , which , as previously alluded to , are a kind of multiplicative , non - commutative analogue of cosheaves . definitions , properties and many examples of factorization algebras are discussed in    [ s : factalgebras ] .",
    "factorization algebras were introduced to describe observables of quantum field theories  @xcite but they also are a very convenient way to encode and study many algebraic structures which arose in algebraic topology and mathematical physics as we illustrate in   [ s : factalgebras ] . in particular , in   [",
    "s : stratifiedfact ] we study in depth locally constant factorization algebras on stratified spaces and their link with various categories of modules over @xmath0-algebras , giving many examples .",
    "we also give a detail account of various operations and properties of factorization algebras in ",
    "[ s : operationsforfact ] .",
    "we then (   [ s : applications ] ) review several applications of the formalism of factorization algebras and homology .",
    "notably to cohomology and deformations of @xmath0-algebras , ( higher ) deligne conjecture and also in ( higher ) string topology and for bar constructions of iterated loop spaces ( and more generally to obtain models for iterated bar constructions _ with _ their algebraic structure ) . in   [",
    "s : comfactalgebras ] , we consider the case of commutative factorization algebras and prove their theory reduces to the one of cosheaves .",
    "in particular , we cover the pedagogical example of classical homology ( with twisted coefficient ) viewed as factorization homology .",
    "factorization homology and factorization algebras generalize ideas from the axiomatic approach to classical homology of spaces ( and ( co)sheaf theory ) which we now recall .",
    "we then explain how they can be generalized .",
    "the usual ( co)homology groups of topological spaces are uniquely determined by a set of axioms .",
    "these are the _ eilenberg - steenrod axioms _ which were formulated in the 40s  @xcite .",
    "classically they express that an homology theory for spaces is uniquely determined by ( ordinary ) functors from the category of pairs @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) of spaces to the category of ( @xmath14)-graded abelian groups satisfying some axioms .",
    "such a functor splits as the direct sum @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the degree @xmath17 homology groups of the pair .",
    "this homology group can in fact be defined as the homology of the mapping cone @xmath18 of the inclusion of the pair .",
    "further , the long exact sequence in homology relating the homology of the pair to the homology of @xmath19 and @xmath20 is induced by a short exact sequence of chain complexes @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 is the singular chain complex ) .",
    "similarly , the mayer - vietoris exact sequence is induced by a short exact sequence of chain complexes .",
    "this suggests that the classical eilenberg - steenrod axioms can be lifted at the _ chain complex _ level .",
    "that is , we can characterize classical homology as a functor from the category of spaces ( up to homotopy ) to the category of chain complexes ( up to quasi - isomorphism ) .",
    "let us formalize a bit this idea .",
    "a _ homology theory _",
    "@xmath23 for _ spaces _ is a functor @xmath24 from the category @xmath25 of topological spaces to the category @xmath26 of chain complexes over @xmath27 ( in other words differential graded abelian groups ) .",
    "this functor has to satisfy the following three axioms .    1 .   _",
    "( homotopy invariance ) _ the functor @xmath23 shall send homotopies between maps of topological spaces to homotopies between maps of chain complexes .",
    "( monoidal ) _ the functor @xmath23 shall be defined by its value on the connected components of a space .",
    "hence we require it sends disjoint unions of topological spaces to direct sum , that is the canonical map @xmath28 is an homotopy equivalence ( here @xmath29 is any set ) .",
    "( excision ) _ there is another additional property encoding ( given the other ones ) the classical excision property as well as the mayer - vietoris principle .",
    "the additional property essentially stipulates the effect of gluing together two cw - complexes along a sub - complex .",
    "let us formulate it this way : assume @xmath30 and @xmath31 are inclusions of closed sub cw - complex of @xmath20 and @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath33 be the pushout of @xmath20 , @xmath32 along @xmath34 .",
    "the functoriality of @xmath23 gives maps @xmath35 and @xmath36 ; hence a chain complex morphism @xmath37 .",
    "functoriality also yields a natural map @xmath38 whose composition with @xmath39 is null .",
    "+ the _ excision axioms requires that the canonical map @xmath40 is an homotopy equivalence_. here @xmath41 is the mapping cone is injective , then @xmath42 is quasi - isomorphic to the quotient chain complex @xmath43 .",
    "see for instance  @xcite for mapping cones of general chain maps . ]",
    "( in @xmath26 ) of the map @xmath44 of chain complexes .",
    "we can state the following theorem ( which follows from corollary  [ c : ordinaryhomologyasfact ] and is the ( pre-)dual of a result of mandell  @xcite for cochains ) .",
    "[ t : eilenberg - steenrod ] let @xmath45 be an abelian group . up to natural homotopy equivalence , there is a unique homology theory for spaces , that is functor @xmath46 satisfying axioms 1 , 2 and 3 and further the _ dimension _ axiom : @xmath47    the functor in theorem  [ t : eilenberg - steenrod ] is of course given by the usual singular chain complex with value in @xmath45 .",
    "we can even assume in the theorem that @xmath45 is any chain complex , in which case we recover extraordinary homology theories .",
    "theorem  [ t : eilenberg - steenrod ] implies that the category of functors satisfying axioms 1 , 2 , 3 is ( homotopy ) equivalent to the category of chain complexes ; the equivalence being given by the evaluation of a functor at the point . to assign to a chain complex @xmath48 an homology theory ,",
    "one consider the functor @xmath49 .",
    "for a cw - complex @xmath20 , the singular cohomology @xmath50 can be computed as sheaf cohomology of @xmath20 with value in the constant sheaf @xmath51 of locallly constant functions on @xmath20 with values in @xmath45 .",
    "in particular , the singular cochain complex is naturally quasi - isomorphic to the derived functor @xmath52 of sections of @xmath51 . replacing @xmath51 by a locally constant sheaf ( with germs @xmath45 )",
    "yields cohomology with local coefficient in @xmath45 is a linear representation of a group @xmath53 and @xmath20 is the classifying space of @xmath53 , then one recovers this way the group ( co)homology of @xmath53 with value in @xmath45 ] .",
    "this point of view realizes singular cohomology ( with local coefficient ) as a special case of the theory of sheaf / ech cohomology which also has other significance and applications in geometry when allowing more general sheaves .",
    "note that the homotopy invariance axiom can be reinterpreted as saying that the functor @xmath23 is continuous . indeed , there are natural topologies on the morphism sets of both categories .",
    "for instance , one can consider the compact - open topology on the set of maps @xmath55 ( see example  [ ex : chains(k ) ] for @xmath26 ) .",
    "any continuous functor , that is a functor @xmath23 such that the maps @xmath56 are continuous , sends homotopies to homotopies ( and homotopies between homotopies to homotopies between homotopies and so on ) .    note also that excision axiom really identifies @xmath57 with a homotopy colimit .",
    "it is precisely the homotopy coequalizer @xmath58 which is computed by the mapping cone @xmath59 .",
    "further , in this axiom , we do not need @xmath23 to be precisely the cone but any natural chain complex quasi - isomorphic to it will do the job .",
    "this suggests to actually use a more flexible model than topological categories",
    ". a convenient way to _ deal simultaneously with topological categories , homotopy colimits _ ( in particular homotopy quotients ) _ and identification of chain complexes up to quasi - isomorphism _ is to consider the @xmath60-categories associated to topological spaces and chain complexes and @xmath60-functors between them ( see appendix  [ s : dkl ] , examples  [ e : hsset ] and  [ ex : chains(k ) ] ) .",
    "the passage from topological categories to @xmath60-categories essentially allows to work in categories in which ( weak ) homotopy equivalences have been somehow inverted but which still retain enough information of the topology of the initial categories .    furthermore , in the monoidal axiom , we can replace the direct sum of chain complexes by any symmetric monoidal structure , for instance by the tensor product @xmath61 of chain complexes .",
    "this yields the notion of homology theory for spaces with values in @xmath62 see    [ sss : axiomsforhh ] .",
    "the latter are not determined by a mere chain complex but by a ( homotopy ) commutative algebra @xmath19 . this theory is called factorization homology for spaces and commutative algebras and its main properties are detailled in   [ s : comalgebracase ] .",
    "in fact , already at this level , we see that one needs to replace the cone construction in the excision axiom by an appropriate derived functor .",
    "to produce invariant of manifolds which are not invariant of spaces , one needs to replace @xmath25 by another topological category of manifolds .",
    "for instance , fixing @xmath63 , one can consider the category @xmath64 whose objects are _ framed manifolds of dimension @xmath1 _ and whose morphisms are framed embeddings . in that case , an homology theory is completely determined by an @xmath0-algebra .",
    "the precise definitions and variants of homology theories for various classes of structured manifolds ( including the local coefficient ones ) and the appropriate notion of coefficient is the content of   [ s : homologytheorymfld ] .",
    "the ( variants of ) @xmath0-algebras which arise as coefficient of homology theory for manifolds can be seen as a special case of factorization algebras , and more precisely as locally constant factorization algebras , which are to factorization algebras what ( acyclic resolutions of ) locally constant sheaves are to sheaves .",
    "this point of view is detailed in  ",

    "<S> these notes are an expanded version of two series of lectures given at the winter school in mathematical physics at les houches and at the vietnamese institute for mathematical sciences . </S>",
    "<S> they are an introduction to factorization algebras , factorization homology and some of their applications , notably for studying @xmath0-algebras . </S>",
    "<S> we give an account of homology theory for manifolds ( and spaces ) , which give invariant of manifolds but also invariant of @xmath0-algebras . </S>",
    "<S> we particularly emphasize the point of view of factorization algebras ( a structure originating from quantum field theory ) which plays , with respect to homology theory for manifolds , the role of sheaves with respect to singular cohomology . </S>",
    "<S> we mention some applications to the study of mapping spaces , in particular in string topology and for ( iterated ) bar constructions and study several examples , including some over stratified spaces . </S>"
