    "the investigation of neutrino oscillations and the precision measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters brought extremely intense neutrino beams .",
    "in this situation , statistical uncertainties are negligible compared to those systematic uncertainties in the neutrino flux , neutrino - nucleus cross sections , and detector effects on both neutrino events selection and neutrino energy reconstruction .",
    "thus , the discovery and study of neutrino oscillations have renewed interest in neutrino - nucleus interactions .",
    "the high intensity neutrino beams allow to study these processes with unprecedented details .    in order to study neutrino oscillation effects in accelerator - based experiments ,",
    "the neutrino beams cover the energy range from a few hundred mev to several gev . in this energy range ,",
    "the dominant contribution to the neutrino - nucleus cross section comes from the charged - current quasielastic ( ccqe ) reaction and resonance production processes .",
    "the ccqe is the simplest interaction that represents a two - particle scattering process with single final - state proton and it may form a two track events sample . in this process",
    "the neutrino energy may be estimated using kinematic or calorimetric reconstruction .    the criteria used to select ccqe events is strongly influenced by both the target material and the detector technology . in",
    "fully active , fine - grained detectors with good resolution , selection techniques that relay on the identification of a single final state proton and lepton can be applied .",
    "one option for these detector designs is to make their active elements as water  @xcite , scintillator  @xcite bars or drift chambers  @xcite formed in to detector planes . a continuous series of these planes forms a region that serves as both primary target and tracking detector .",
    "another option for fully active and fine - grained detectors is liquid argon time projection chamber ( lar tpc )  @xcite which offers a relatively good particle identification .",
    "the high spatial resolution and energy measurement down to the mev scale provides information for low and high energy particles .",
    "this information allows reduced background for the events of interest and potentially improved cross section measurements .",
    "the lar tpc detectors are well - suited for long baseline @xmath1 appearance physics because of their high efficiency for @xmath1 signal events and low background from @xmath2 events  @xcite .",
    "therefore , there is a growing interest in measuring neutrino cross sections on argon .",
    "unfortunately , the cross section data for lepton scattering on argon in relevant energy range are rather scarce . there are only experimental data for inclusive 700-mev electron scattering off @xmath0ar  @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the structures of @xmath0ca and @xmath0ar nuclei are almost identical and for calcium precise measurements have been performed and are described below .",
    "high resolution exclusive @xmath3 experiments , where a proton is emitted with a direct knockout mechanism on @xmath0ca and @xmath4ca were carried out at tokyo  @xcite , saclay  @xcite , and nikhef  @xcite .",
    "specific quantum numbers and spectroscopic factors have been assigned to the peaks in the observed energy spectrum by studying the missing energy and momentum dependence of experimental cross sections .",

    "the comparison of different models with the data is described in refs  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we compute the exclusive , inclusive and total cross sections for the ccqe neutrino scattering from @xmath0ca and @xmath0ar using the rdwia model .",
    "the calculations of the inclusive cross sections are performed with our approach , which includes the final state interaction ( fsi ) effects in the presence of short - range nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath6 ) correlations in the ground state  @xcite .",
    "this approach was successfully applied in refs .",
    "first we compare our model in describing @xmath0ca@xmath7k and @xmath0ca@xmath5 data",
    ". then we apply it to the calculation of the ccqe cross sections for the neutrino scattering on @xmath0ca and @xmath0ar nuclei .",
    "the goals of this work are the following : ( a ) calculation of the rdwia ccqe @xmath8ar cross sections ,",
    "( b ) comparison of the total cross sections , scaled with the number of ( proton)neutrons in the target for ( anti)neutrino scattering on the carbon , oxygen , and argon targets , and ( c ) investigation of nuclear effects on these cross sections .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present briefly the formalism for the ccqe scattering process and basic aspects of the model used for the calculation .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "in this section we consider shortly the formalism used to describe electron and neutrino quasi - elastic exclusive @xmath9 and inclusive @xmath10 scattering off nuclei in the one - photon ( w - boson ) exchange approximation . here",

    "all information about the nuclear structure and fsi effects is contained in the electromagnetic and weak cc hadronic tensors , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which are given by the bilinear products of the transition matrix elements of the nuclear electromagnetic or cc operator @xmath46 between the initial nucleus state @xmath47 and the final state @xmath48 as @xmath49 where the sum is taken over undetected states .",
    "the experimental data of the @xmath3 reaction are usually presented in terms of the reduced cross section @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are phase - space factors for electron and neutrino scattering and @xmath53 is the corresponding elementary cross section for the lepton scattering from the moving free nucleon .",
    "the reduced cross section is an interesting quantity that can be regarded as the nucleon momentum distribution modified by fsi .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that reduced cross sections for ( anti)neutrino scattering off carbon and oxygen are similar to the electron scattering apart from small differences at low beam energy due to effects of coulomb distortion of the incoming electron wave function .",
    "we describe the lepton - nuclear scattering in the impulse approximation ( ia ) , assuming that the incoming lepton interacts with only one nucleon of the target , which is subsequently emitted , while the remaining ( a-1 ) nucleons in the target are spectators . when the nuclear current is written as a sum of single - nucleon currents , the nuclear matrix element in eq.([w ] )",
    "can write as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the vertex function , @xmath56 is the recoil - corrected momentum transfer , @xmath57 is the invariant mass , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the relativistic bound - state and outgoing wave functions . for electron scattering ,",

    "the simplest choice is to use the plane - wave function @xmath84 , assuming that there is no interaction between the ejected nucleon @xmath85 and the residual nucleus @xmath86 . in this plane - wave impulse approximation ( pwia )",
    "the exclusive cross section is factorized into the product of the phase - space factor @xmath87 , elementary off - shell lepton - nucleon scattering cross section , and the hole spectral function .",
    "thus , in the pwia the reduced cross section can be interpreted as the momentum distribution of the emitted nucleon when it was inside the nucleus . for more realistic description ,",
    "fsi effects should be taking into account . in the rdwia",
    "the distorted wave function @xmath84 is evaluated as a solution of the dirac equation containing a phenomenological relativistic optical potential .",
    "this potential consists of a real part , which describes the rescattering of the ejected nucleon and an imaginary part which accounts for its absorption into unobserved channels .    using the direct pauli reduction method  @xcite ,",
    "the system of two coupled first - order dirac equations can be reduced to a single second - order schrdinger - like equation for the upper component of the dirac wave function @xmath84 .",
    "this equation contains equivalent nonrelativistic central and spin - orbit potentials which are functions of the relativistic , energy dependent , scalar , and vector optical potentials .",

    "this code was successfully tested against @xmath88 data for electron scattering off @xmath89c and @xmath90o  @xcite and we adopted this program for neutrino reaction  @xcite .",
    "a complex optical potential with a nonzero imaginary part generally produces an absorption of the flux . for the exclusive @xmath91 channel",
    "this reflects the coupling between different open reaction channels .",
    "however , for the inclusive reaction , the total flux must be conserved . in refs .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the inclusive ccqe neutrino cross section of the exclusive channel @xmath91 is calculated with only the real part of the optical potential is almost identical when calculated via the green s function approach  @xcite , in which the fsi effects on inclusive reaction @xmath92 are treated by means of a complex potential , and the total flux is conserved .",
    "we calculate the inclusive and total cross sections with the edad1 relativistic optical potential in which only the real part is included .",
    "the inclusive cross sections with the fsi effects in the presence of the short - range @xmath6 correlations are calculated using the method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this approach",
    "the contribution of the @xmath6 correlated pairs is evaluated in the pwia .",
    "the fsi effects for the high - momentum component are estimated by scaling the pwia cross section with the @xmath93 function determined in ref .",
    "in this work the ipsm is assumed for the @xmath0ca and @xmath0ar nuclear structures . the model space for @xmath0ca@xmath94 consists of 1@xmath95 , 1@xmath96 , 1@xmath97 , 1@xmath98 , 2@xmath95 and 1@xmath99 nucleon - hole states in @xmath100k and @xmath100ca nuclei .        the model space for @xmath0ar@xmath94 consists of 1@xmath95 , 1@xmath96 , 1@xmath97 , 1@xmath98 , 2@xmath95 and 1@xmath99 nucleon - hole states in @xmath100cl , and 1@xmath95 , 1@xmath96 , 1@xmath97 , 1@xmath98 , 2@xmath95 , 1@xmath99 and 1@xmath101 nucleon - hole states in @xmath100ar .",

    "there is an overall good agreement between calculated cross sections , but the values of the electron cross sections at the maximum is systematically higher than those for ( anti)neutrino .",

    "then we calculated in the same approach the @xmath148 ratios in the presence of the @xmath6 correlations in the ground states of nuclei .",
    "note , in our calculations the averaged occupancies of the ipsm orbitals of @xmath89c , @xmath90o , and @xmath0ar are : @xmath149=0.89 , @xmath150=0.75 , and @xmath151=0.87 .",
    "the @xmath6 correlation effect , i.e. the difference between the cross sections as a consequence of different @xmath6 pair contributions was calculated as @xmath152=@xmath153 .",
    "the fsi effects are different between the cross sections due to interaction of the outgoing nucleons with the different residual nuclei .",
    "for example , @xmath154c for the neutrino or @xmath155b for the antineutrino scattering off the @xmath89c and @xmath156o for the neutrino and @xmath157n for the antineutrino scattering off @xmath90o .",
    "these effects were estimated as the difference @xmath158=@xmath159 , where the ratio @xmath23 is calculated in the rdwia approach is shown in fig . 9 and 10 .",
    "the total nuclear effect is sum @xmath160=@xmath161 .",
    "the result of the cross section comparison for the ( anti)neutrino scattering on carbon and oxygen as well as on carbon and argon is displayed in figs .",
    "12 and 13 , correspondingly . in these figures",
    "the differences @xmath162 and @xmath160 are shown as functions of neutrino energy .",
    "comparison of the cross sections for @xmath89c and @xmath90o shows that the nuclear structure effects for the neutrino and antineutrino interactions are small and similar .",
    "the function @xmath146 increases slowly with energy up to @xmath1262% at @xmath123=2.8 gev .",
    "the @xmath6 correlation effects decrease with increased ( anti)neutrino energy . for the neutrino(antineutrino ) scattering the function @xmath163 reduces from @xmath126 8%(7% ) at @xmath123=0.5 gev up to @xmath1264%(4% ) at @xmath123=2.8 gev .",
    "the fsi effects are higher for the antineutrino scattering than those for the neutrino interaction . for the neutrino ( antineutrino ) scattering the function @xmath164 decreases from @xmath1263%(9% ) at @xmath123=0.5 gev down to @xmath1262%(3.5% ) at @xmath123=2.8 gev and the total nuclear effect @xmath165=0.11(0.17 ) at @xmath123=0.5 gev and reduces down to 0.08(0.09 ) at @xmath123=2.8 gev .    to conclude , the main sources of the distinction between the carbon and oxygen cross sections are different @xmath6 pair contributions in the @xmath89c ( 11% ) and @xmath90o ( 25% ) ground states . for the antineutrino cross sections the fsi effects are the same order as @xmath6 correlation effects at @xmath166 1 gev .",
    "the precise measurement and accurate calculation of the @xmath6 correlation contributions are important for a reliable estimation of the difference between the @xmath89c and @xmath90o cross sections .",
    "comparison of the cross sections for @xmath89c and @xmath0ar shows that the nuclear structure effects at @xmath1670.5 gev are identical for neutrino and antineutrino interactions .",
    "the function @xmath146=0.06 at @xmath123=0.5 gev and increases slowly with energy up to @xmath1260.07 at @xmath123=2.8 gev .",
    "the @xmath6 correlation effects of 1 - 2% are small .",
    "the fsi effects are higher for the antineutrino scattering . for the neutrino ( antineutrino )",
    "interaction @xmath158 is about 0.045(0.13 ) for @xmath123=0.5 gev and reduces with energy down to 0.035(0.06 ) for @xmath123=2.8 gev and the total nuclear effect @xmath160=0.12 ( 0.18 ) at @xmath123=0.5 gev and @xmath1260.13(0.13 ) at @xmath123=2.8 gev .",
    "thus the nuclear structure and fsi effects give the dominant contribution to the difference between the @xmath89c and @xmath0ar total cross sections per neutron / proton .",
    "in this work , we study electron and ccqe ( anti)neutrino scattering on calcium and argon targets in different approaches ( pwia , rdwia , rfgm ) . the rdwia model were widely and successfully applied to the analysis of the available electron scattering data over a wide range of nuclei .",
    "first , the reduced cross sections for electron and ( anti)neutrino scattering off @xmath0ca calculated in the rdwia were tested against @xmath0ca@xmath3 data .",
    "we found that the result for ( anti)neutrino scattering are similar to those for electron scattering ( apart from the small differences due to the coulomb correction ) and the latter are in good agreement with the electron data . also it was shown that the reduced cross sections for the removal of the proton from the shells of @xmath0ca and @xmath0ar are very similar .",
    "the inclusive cross sections , calculated in the rdwia model , which has been modified with phenomenological spectroscopic factors and nucleon high - momentum components in the target were tested against @xmath0ca@xmath5 data .",
    "the results generally agree within about 14% . on the other hand , in the qe peak region",
    "the rfgm overestimates the value of the inclusive cross sections at low momentum transfer and the discrepancy with data reduces as this momentum increases .",
    "also , it was shown that the measured and calculated in the rdwia inclusive cross sections per nucleon for electron scattering off @xmath89c , @xmath90o , and @xmath0ca decreases with the mass - number of the target in the qe peak region .",
    "the ccqe total cross sections for ( anti)neutrino scattering on calcium and argon predicted by the rfgm are higher than those obtained in the rdwia and the difference decreases with ( anti)neutrino energy .",
    "the relative contribution of the @xmath168 channels to the ccqe total cross section is lower for heavier nuclei due to the fsi and @xmath6 pair effects . for ( anti)neutrino scattering on carbon , oxygen , and argon we compared the total cross sections ( scaled with the number of neutrons / protons in the target ) and found that the cross sections calculated within the rdwia for @xmath90o and @xmath0ar are lower than those calculated for @xmath89c . in the rfgm",
    "the cross sections for carbon are practically equal to those for oxygen and they are higher by about 2 - 5% than those for argon at @xmath1690.5 gev .",
    "we also studied different sources of the distinction between the @xmath89c , @xmath90o , and @xmath0ar cross sections per neutron / proton .",
    "we have found that the difference between the @xmath89c and @xmath90o cross sections is mainly due to different @xmath6 correlation contributions in the ground states of the nuclei and fsi effects .",
    "the main sources of the difference between the @xmath89c and @xmath0ar cross sections are the nuclear structure and fsi effects .",
    "thus the rdwia approach predicts that the ccqe differential and total cross sections per neutron / proton reduces slowly with the mass - number of the target due to the nuclear effects .",
    "although the model and theoretical ingredients adopted in the calculations contain approximations , our results can serve as a useful reference for long base - line neutrino oscillation experiments",
    "we thank l. lapiks for providing the nikhef data tables .",
    "we especially thank j. morfin , b. ziemer and d. perevalov for fruitful discussions and a critical reading of the manuscript .",
