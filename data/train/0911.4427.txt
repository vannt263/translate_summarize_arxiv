    "transport phenomena in superconductors have been heavily investigated for many years . recently , sub - micron scaled multi - terminal normal metal / superconductor ( ns ) devices came to renewed attention of both , experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite investigations , mainly because of a quantum mechanically non - local process called crossed andreev reflection ( car ) . in _",
    "andreev reflection , an electron impinging on the ns interface from the n side can enter the superconductor at subgap energies only by forming a cooper pair ( cp ) with a second electron . to maintain momentum conservation",
    "a hole is retro - reflected into the n contact . as depicted in figure  1a , in car",
    "the hole is reflected into a second contact n2 separated by less than the superconducting coherence length from the first contact n1 .",
    "the inverse process can be described as splitting of a cooper pair with the electrons entering two separate contacts .",
    "since ideally the two electrons retain their correlations from the superconductor , this process might provide a source of spin - entangled electron pairs in a solid - state environment @xcite .",
    "cooper pair splitting has been demonstrated very recently in a double quantum dot system @xcite , where the strong coulomb interaction in the quantum dots leads to a suppression of other competing transport mechanisms .",
    "in contrast , the experimental observation of car in metallic structures is more challenging because of other subgap processes of similar probability , namely elastic co - tunnelling ( ec ) and non - local charge imbalance ( ci ) .",
    "ec is the direct electron transfer from one contact to the other via virtual intermediate states in the superconductor .",
    "it has been shown theoretically that without interactions and to the lowest order in the tunnelling rate , ec exactly cancels the effects of car .",
    "several recent publications @xcite show experimentally that this cancellation can be lifted .",
    "various models have been proposed to understand these findings @xcite , for example dynamical coulomb blockade ( dcb ) and interactions via electromagnetic excitations of the environment @xcite . here",
    "we present data that support our previous interpretation in terms of dcb @xcite . in the main part of the paper , however , we focus on charge imbalance ( ci ) , i.e. on non - equilibrium effects in the superconductor .",
    "it is well - established that at finite bias charged quasi - particles ( qps ) are excited above the gap in the superconductor by tunnelling injection of electrons , which leads to ci in the superconductor @xcite , see figure  1b .",
    "these qps diffuse away from the injector contact and lead to a potential gradient in the superconductor , see figure  1c . distinguishing car from ci and ec is essential for the investigation of car and",
    "can be achieved by ferromagnetic contacts @xcite , the sign of the non - local signal @xcite , or the characteristic temperature @xcite or distance dependence @xcite .",
    "usually , several of these criteria have to be employed to discern the subgap processes .",
    "we show that non - local ci exhibits a strong characteristic dependence on a magnetic field applied parallel to the axis of the superconducting wire .",
    "this dependence is due to the reduction of the pair breaking time , well - described by the conventional ci description @xcite adapted to our non - local measurements .",
    "in addition , we study the contact resistance dependence of non - local ci and compare the results to a recent theoretical model of subgap processes in superconductors @xcite .",

    "the aluminum is about @xmath4 nm thick and has a resistivity of @xmath5 cm , a mean - free path of @xmath6 nm and a ` dirty limit ' coherence length of @xmath7 nm . in direct transport experiments",
    "we find a critical temperature of @xmath8k and a critical magnetic field of @xmath9mt ( at @xmath10k and with the field applied parallel to the superconducting wire ) .",
    "we concentrate on data obtained using the three contacts n4 , n5 and n6 , with the conductance vs. bias characteristics shown in figure  1e . while the junctions n5 and n6 have similar conductances , n4 exhibits roughly five times larger values .",
    "the characteristics can be fitted to the btk model @xcite , with an additional broadening parameter and the barrier strength @xmath11 used as fit parameters ( for n4 we also slightly adjusted the @xmath12k normal state resistance @xmath13 ) .",

    "the subgap feature is washed out and the signal becomes positive for all voltages .",
    "similar curves are obtained for the contact pair ( n4 , n5 ) , except that no zero - bias maximum develops ( not shown ) .",
    "we attribute a negative non - local resistance to car and a positive sign to ec or ci .",
    "the development of the local maximum at low temperatures for the data with the less transparent injector n6 is probably due to a shift in the relative strength of car and ec , caused by enhanced dynamical coulomb blockade @xcite .    to further support this interpretation",
    "we report here a zero - bias anomaly in the conductance of the junctions n5 and n6 , consistent with dynamical coulomb blockade . as an example , we plot the conductance of junction n6 at base temperature in figure  1f . here , superconductivity is suppressed by an external magnetic field of @xmath0 t , to avoid features due to the superconductor gap .",

    "we also plot the theoretically expected response due to dynamical coulomb blockade for a junction capacitance of @xmath0ff ( estimated from a plate capacitor model ) with a resistive environment @xcite .",
    "the only fit parameter is the environmental resistance , which we adjusted to @xmath39 .",
    "this value might be explained by the transmission - line response of the cryostat cables .",
    "the zero - bias anomaly is strongly suppressed at higher temperatures .",
    "we observe a similar feature in the conductance of n5 , but a constant conductance for n4 .",
    "when the latter is used as injector we observe no maximum at zero bias in the non - local signal .",
    "now we discuss the magnetic field dependence of the subgap signals . from direct conductance measurements of the aluminum strip",
    "we infer a critical field of @xmath40mt . in figure  2b ,",
    "a series of @xmath35 vs. @xmath36 curves of the contact pair ( n6 , n5 ) is shown for different magnetic fields applied parallel to the al wire . at bias potentials larger than the superconductor energy gap the non - local resistance",
    "is strongly reduced already for relatively small fields , @xmath41 .",
    "in contrast to this , the subgap features are not or only very weakly affected . at @xmath42 , e.g. for @xmath43mt ,",
    "the non - local response becomes zero for all voltages .",
    "these findings can be seen clearer in magnetic field traces for the contact pair ( n4 , n5 ) , which exhibits an appreciable non - local resistance at base temperature and zero bias , see figure  2c . at @xmath10k",
    "the signal is negative and we tentatively attribute it to car . we find that this signal is independent of @xmath44 for @xmath41 .",
    "only near @xmath45 the signal increases and reaches positive values .",
    "we note that the signal does not reach zero exactly for @xmath42 , possibly due to a small cross talk current in the device , though the signal does not change upon doubling of the measurement frequency .",

    "this inconsistent behaviour might be related to the different coherence lengths in the materials used for the superconductor wire and normal metal contacts , or the different sample geometries .",
    "however , we note that in contrast to our previous experiments @xcite , the out - of - phase part of the low - temperature signal in figure  2c has a similar amplitude as the in - phase signal , so that our results on car have to be considered as preliminary .",
    "in contrast to car , the magnetic field dependence of ci can be well understood by adapting the standard ci description @xcite to non - local experiments : we assume that the injected quasi - particles ( qps ) diffuse isotropically in the al wire ( ideally , the electric field in the superconductor is zero ) and that the qp concentration near the detector contact determines the induced voltage in a similar way as in local measurements .",
    "this leads to the following expression for the non - local resistance :    @xmath51    where @xmath52 denotes the ci relaxation time , @xmath53 the fraction of current that is carried by the injected qps at a given bias , @xmath54 the density of states of the normal state al , @xmath55 the injection volume , for which we insert the superconductor volume below the injector contact .",
    "@xmath56 is the zero bias detector conductance at the temperature of the experiment , normalized to the conductance of the junction in the normal state , and @xmath57 is the distance between injector and detector .",
    "the charge imbalance relaxation length @xmath58 is the distance over which the qp distribution function in a superconductor relaxes to its equilibrium value .",
    "it is related to @xmath52 by @xmath59 , with @xmath60 the electron diffusion constant in al .",
    "several processes influence @xmath52 , like inelastic electron - phonon scattering , pair breaking by spin - active impurities , orbital motion , a finite supercurrent or inhomogeneities in the order parameter @xmath61 .",
    "generally , the qp life time reads @xcite    @xmath62    around zero bias the injector current is small and we can ignore effects due to pair breaking of the supercurrent . for a homogeneous gap parameter",
    "this leads to @xmath63 with @xmath64 the orbital pair breaking and @xmath65 the inelastic scattering time .",
    "for the temperature dependence of the energy gap we use the standard bcs expression @xmath66 and for the magnetic field dependence @xmath67 with @xmath68 .",
    "the orbital pair breaking time as a function of @xmath44 is given by @xmath69 @xcite .    at zero bias",
    "the only fit parameters are @xmath70 and @xmath65 and we obtain @xmath71 and @xmath72ns , corresponding to @xmath73 m , for the fit shown in figure  2c .",
    "as expected , @xmath74 since the total current at zero bias is dominated by andreev reflection .",
    "the relaxation time is considerably smaller than reported for thick ( @xmath75ns ) and thin films ( @xmath76ns ) @xcite , but consistent with the reduced charge imbalance length found in other experiments on superconducting al wires @xcite .",
    "the reduction of @xmath65 for thin films was attributed to enhanced electron - electron scattering for films of thickness smaller than @xmath77 @xcite , which we estimate to @xmath78 nm at @xmath25k for our structures . we expect a similar additional suppression in thin wires .",
    "the finite bias experiments shown in figure  2d were performed at base temperature , which leads to a larger energy gap and a characteristic increase of ci at a larger field compared to figure  2c .",
    "in addition , the finite supercurrent at an increased bias leads to a reduction of the energy gap and we expect a reduction of the qp relaxation time due to additional pair breaking .",
    "the latter effect is strong only for large currents near @xmath45 , so that we can attribute the increase in @xmath35 with bias at @xmath46 to a change of @xmath70 : for a larger bias a larger fraction of the total current is generated by qp injection .",
    "we note that @xmath35 turns negative when the injected current is comparable to the critical current for given external parameters .",
    "we observe this effect in figure  2d for @xmath79 , as well as in the bias sweeps at elevated temperatures shown below in figure  3a .",
    "we attribute this phenomenon to the initial stages of the breakdown of superconductivity , possibly at phase - slip centers , which renders the current inhomogeneous .",
    "the previous section shows that the qp diffusion is well described by the standard theory .",
    "we now turn our attention to the contact resistance dependence of the ci induced non - local resistance .",
    "this is an important question since car and ec are strongly affected by the junction characteristics @xcite .",

    "c ) and d ) show the corresponding curves calculated in the model of reference @xcite with the experimental traces discussed in the text.,title=\"fig : \" ]    to obtain a reasonable signal strength , we performed the experiments at @xmath25k . in figure",
    "3a the non - local resistance @xmath35 is plotted vs. bias for a series of injector - detector pairs .",
    "the curves with the same injector contact are almost identical and can be clearly distinguished from the other curves .",
    "the distinction is most obvious if we use n4 as injector , with a considerably larger conductance than the other contacts . in contrast , using n4 as detector does _ not _ lead to a significant change in the non - local resistance , as can be seen for example for the pairs ( n5 , n4 ) and ( n5 , n6 ) .",
    "a comparison of the non - local resistance at zero bias between injector and detector pairs as a function of temperature is shown in figure  3b .",
    "we note the characteristic shape of the curve that allows one to identify ci @xcite .",
    "we find that near zero bias and for @xmath80k the non - local resistance becomes the same for all contact pairs and thus seemingly independent of the contact resistances . for bias potentials larger than the energy gap the corresponding curves are not identical and the signal amplitude depends stronger on the injector than on the detector resistance , see figure 3a .",
    "first we compare our data with the standard theory described by equation  1 and investigate the relative change between two curves . for the measurements with the same injector , @xmath70 and @xmath55",
    "are identical and we expect that only the distance between the contacts and the normalized conductance @xmath81 are relevant . as an example , using the experimentally determined @xmath81 at @xmath25k and the ci length obtained in the previous section , we expect a factor of @xmath82 between data points from the pairs ( n5 , n4 ) and ( n5 , n6 ) at the same bias . in figure  3c",
    "these two curves are replotted on a smaller scale .",
    "we obtain a factor @xmath83 between these two curves at zero bias .",
    "the standard deviation is even larger for the other pairs .",
    "we therefore conclude that the deviation from the standard description of ci is not significant due to the low signal - to - noise ratio . at higher bias",
    "the deviation from equation  1 is more pronounced , as shown in figure  3a , where the expected non - local resistance at @xmath84mv is indicated by a green and a blue arrow for the pairs ( n5 , n6 ) and ( n6 , n5 ) , based on the values of the pairs ( n5 , n4 ) and ( n6 , n4 ) , respectively .",
    "however , in this regime an appreciable supercurrent is flowing in the device and we do not expect equation  1 to hold exactly .    swapping the injector and detector contacts",
    "allows one to compare signals independent of the contact distance . in this scheme , however , it is necessary to estimate @xmath70 and the injection volume , each introducing considerable errors .",
    "for example , by assuming that @xmath70 is similar for two contacts ( e.g. for large bias @xmath85 ) one finds a factor of @xmath86 between the curves with swapped contacts ( n4 , n6 ) and ( n6 , n4 ) .",
    "this is not supported by our data , see figure  3b , which shows that @xmath70 varies between the contacts even at zero bias .",
    "our experimental results can be understood quantitatively by the model put forward in reference @xcite , which we adapt slightly so that the experimental junction parameters in table  1 can be used .",
    "the non - local resistance of our device in terms of conductances reads @xmath87 where @xmath88 ( @xmath89inj , det ) is the local conductance of the injector and detector and @xmath90 are the energy dependent spectral conductances of the ns barriers @xcite : @xmath91 with @xmath92 the heaviside function .",
    "the general expression for the non - local conductance @xmath93 is presented in reference @xcite .",
    "provided the charge imbalance length @xmath58 is shorter than the length of a superconducting wire ( which is the case in our experiments ) , we find @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 is the superconducting wire cross - section .",
    "note that at zero bias and in the limit @xmath97 , i.e. close to the critical temperature or the critical magnetic field , equation [ rnl1 ] reduces to equation [ rnl ] with @xmath98 .",
    "one can see that for @xmath99 the resistances of the ns barriers cancel out and do not enter the expression for the non - local resistance , which depends on the barrier properties only through the btk parameters @xmath100 .",
    "furthermore , in both limits of high and low temperatures also these factors drop out and one arrives at the following simple expressions for the non - local resistance @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the normal state resistances of the superconducting wire segments of lengths @xmath58 and @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "thus , we find that the non - local resistance in these limits only depends on the distance between the junctions and the properties of the superconducting wire , but not on the properties of the ns barriers .    in figure  3c ,",
    "numerically calculated @xmath35 curves based on the above equations are shown for @xmath25k , with material and contact characteristics from the experiments , including @xmath105 m from the magnetic field dependence .",
    "we stress that no fit parameters are used for these plots .",
    "we find that the calculations quantitatively reproduce our data .",
    "the two curves with larger contact separation exhibit a reduced non - local resistance compared to the other curves , which could not be resolved in the experiment .",
    "figure  3d shows calculated temperature sweeps , which compare very well to the experimental curves . for this comparison we have subtracted a small constant from the data , since the model does not account for negative non - local resistance , because no electron interactions are considered in this model . in this model , the swapping of the injector and detector results in identical curves , also in agreement with our data .",
    "in summary , we report measurements of the non - local resistance in a multi - terminal superconductor / normal metal device . we show a zero - bias anomaly at base temperature in the normal state of the superconductor consistent with dynamical coulomb blockade , which might be partly responsible for lifting the balance between crossed andreev reflection ( car ) and elastic co - tunnelling .",
    "we then focus on charge imbalance ( ci ) and demonstrate a characteristic magnetic field dependence , which provides a novel tool to distinguish car and ci in future experiments . by comparing our data to a generalization of the standard description of ci",
    ", we can extract the inelastic quasi particle relaxation time and find a reduction relative to literature values probably due to the reduced dimensions of the superconductor wire .",
    "in addition we present a set of experiments where we analyze systematically pairs of injector and detector contacts .",
    "to generate ci , we chose a rather high temperature , at which the superconducting and the normal junction resistances differ only weakly , which results in only small differences in the curves .",
    "the results suggest that the contact resistances influence the non - local ci only weakly .",
    "this finding is reproduced in a theoretical model adapted to incorporate experimentally accessible parameters .",
    "this model does not require additional adjustable parameters and agrees quantitatively with our data .",
