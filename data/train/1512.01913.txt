    "ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) is an important phenomenon which can be used to probe magnetic properties of ferromagnetic materials besides many other applications @xcite .",
    "microwave absorption is usually measured in traditional fmr experiments , and the absorption lineshape around fmr is a lorentzian function of microwave frequency for a fixed static magnetic field . the peak position and peak width can be used to determine magnetic anisotropy and the gilbert damping coefficient @xcite . in recent years , the electrical detection of fmr , in which a dc - voltage is measured on a sample around fmr , becomes very popular due to the high accuracy of dc - voltage measurements and only microns sample size needed @xcite .",
    "this technique has been used by many groups @xcite in recent years to extract spin pumping and the spin hall angle that measures the strength of both the spin hall effect ( she ) and the inverse spin hall effect ( ishe ) .",
    "however , the experimentally extracted material parameters show a large discrepancy for the same materials with similar experimental setup . for example",
    ", the spin hall angle of pt obtained by different groups differs from each other by two orders of magnitude @xcite due to different interpretations of the dc - voltage signal .",
    "the dc - voltage in an electrical detection of fmr can come from two sources .",
    "one is the generalized ohm s law in which the well - known anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr ) and anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) couple the magnetization motion with the electric current ( see the discussion below ) @xcite .",
    "this coupling between the magnetization and microwave - induced electric current results in the so - called spin rectification effect @xcite that gives rise to a detectable dc - voltage inside a magnetic layer or multilayer at fmr .",
    "the other dc - voltage source is the ishe : a spin current converts into a transverse charge current via ishe inside a multilayer , and the charge current , in turn , gives rise to a dc - voltage . in the popular spin - hall - angle experiments",
    "@xcite , the spin current comes from spin pumping by magnetization precession at fmr @xcite . to use the electrical detection of fmr as a probe of material properties",
    ", one needs to separate different dc - voltage sources .",
    "a common way is the symmetry analysis of dc - voltage lineshapes .",
    "the ishe contribution to dc - voltage is normally assumed to have a symmetric lineshape @xcite , resembling microwave absorption curves .",
    "the amr contribution to dc - voltage can be symmetric @xcite , antisymmetric @xcite or asymmetric @xcite although resistance normally links to energy dissipation .",
    "on the other hand , the ahe contribution can be antisymmetric @xcite or vanishing small @xcite because the hall effect does not necessarily involve energy dissipation , depending on material properties and experimental setup .",
    "so far , most analyses @xcite assume that the static response of magnetization is always along the external magnetic field so that the microwave - induced magnetization precession is around the external static magnetic field . furthermore , the two off - diagonal matrix elements of the dynamic magnetic susceptibility are assumed to be opposite to each other .",
    "however , both assumptions are questionable for layer / multilayer samples .",
    "interfacial spin - orbit interactions and/or other interactions may modify the magnetic anisotropy of a film @xcite . as we shall see below",
    ", the dynamic magnetic susceptibility of a sample with non - zero magnetic anisotropy is not a polder tensor in general . for a given experimental setup",
    ", the dc - voltage due to amr and ahe is very sensitive to the dynamic magnetic susceptibility since the spin rectification effect comes from the phase lag of radio frequency ( rf ) magnetization precession and rf current .",
    "thus , the dynamic magnetic susceptibility at fmr is a central quantity .    in this work ,",
    "we obtain general expressions of the dynamic magnetic susceptibility matrix of an arbitrary magnetic material near fmr based on the casuality principle and the fact that microwave absorption at fmr is a lorentzian in microwave frequency at a fixed static magnetic field .",
    "the dynamic magnetic susceptibility is not a polder tensor in general .",
    "it becomes a polder tensor when the sample is isotropic or uniaxial with the static magnetic field along its easy - axis .",
    "the matrix is fully characterized by a few constants that can be determined by traditional microwave absorption experiments .",
    "interestingly , the linear response coefficient of the magnetization to the total rf field , the sum of the applied external rf field and the internal rf field due to the magnetization precession , is a polder tensor .",
    "however , this coefficient is not the dynamic magnetic susceptibility , and can not be measured directly . furthermore , under a fixed rf , the susceptibility matrix elements may have multiple peaks in the field at a fixed microwave frequency in contrast to a single peak in frequency at a fixed field .",
    "the multiple field peaks come from the non - monotonic behavior of the total effective magnetic field to the externally applied static magnetic field . with the knowledge on the dynamic magnetic susceptibility matrix , it is possible to separate the contributions of the amr to the dc - voltage from that of the ahe .",
    "we also show that another broad peak may appear in the susceptibility matrix elements if the resonance frequency is not very sensitive to the externally applied magnetic field . in turn",
    ", a broad peak might also appear in the field - dependence of the microwave absorption curves as well as the dc - voltage lineshape .",
    "this peak is not from the resonance , and its shape is not lorentzian .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we first reformulate the generalized ohm s law for a magnetic metal , and explain how a dc - voltage can come out of the spin rectification at fmr .",
    "then we derive the expression of the dynamic magnetic susceptibility matrix both as a function of microwave frequency or as a function of static magnetic field .",
    "the experimental method of determining the matrix is then given .",
    "with the dynamic magnetic susceptibility matrix , we analyse the dc - voltage from amr and ahe .",
    "section iii uses several examples to verify the general form of the dynamic magnetic susceptibility matrix obtained in sec .",
    "we show how multiple fmr peaks in field at a fixed frequency can come from the non - monotonic behavior of the effective field in applied field , and how a non - resonance peak can arise when the resonance frequency ( or effective field ) is not sensitive to the externally applied static magnetic field .",
    "the conclusion is given in sec .",
    "iv , followed by acknowledgement .",
    "the electrical detection of fmr is based on the generalized ohm s law in a polycrystalline ferromagnetic metal @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the magnitude of magnetization @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are respectively the magnetic field and the electric current density .",
    "@xmath5 is the longitudinal resistivity when @xmath2 and @xmath4 are perpendicular with each other .",
    "@xmath6 is the difference between @xmath7 and the longitudinal resistivity @xmath8 when @xmath2 is parallel to @xmath4 , and the @xmath9-term is called amr . @xmath10 and @xmath11 describe respectively the ordinary and anomalous hall effects .",
    "is in fact the most general linear response of electric field of a polycrystalline magnet to an applied electric current density .",
    "it could be understood by the following reasoning . for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume that there is no external field ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "for the linear response of the electric field @xmath13 to an electric current density @xmath4 , the most general expression of @xmath13 must be @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a rank-2 cartesian tensor that depends on @xmath2 since @xmath2 is the only available vector .",
    "it is well - known that a cartesian tensor of rank 2 can be decomposed into the direct sum of a scalar of function of @xmath1 , a vector that is a function of @xmath1 multiplying @xmath2 , and a traceless symmetric tensor of a function of @xmath1 multiplying @xmath16 .",
    "thus the most general expression of @xmath13 is @xmath17 .",
    "this is exactly eq . , and",
    "no new physics is obtained from this reasoning .",
    "however , things are very different if we carry out the similar analysis for a polycrystalline magnetic film lying in the @xmath18-plane .",
    "although the polycrystalline sample is isotropic in the film plane , @xmath19 is an available vector and @xmath20 should be a function of both @xmath2 and @xmath19 .",
    "since three vectors ( @xmath2 , @xmath19 , and @xmath21 ) and three traceless symmetric tensors ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 ) , can be constructed out of @xmath2 and @xmath19 we have , with similar reasoning as we used early for polycrystline magnetic bulk , @xmath25\\cdot\\mathbf j+\\rho_2(\\hat z\\hat z-1/3)\\cdot\\mathbf j= \\rho_{\\perp } \\mathbf j - r_1 \\mathbf j \\times \\mathbf m+ ( \\delta\\rho / m^2 ) ( \\mathbf m\\cdot\\mathbf j)\\mathbf m-\\rho_1\\mathbf j \\times \\hat z + r_2 ( \\hat z\\cdot\\mathbf j)\\mathbf m+r_3(\\mathbf m\\cdot\\mathbf j)\\hat z -r_4 m_z \\mathbf j + \\rho_2(\\hat z\\cdot\\mathbf j)\\hat z$ ] , where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 . the @xmath29-term may be interpreted as the spin - hall term if the sign of @xmath29 for spin - up electrons is opposite to that for spin - down electrons .",
    "it is known that spin - orbit interactions can lead to a term like this .",
    "obviously , @xmath30 contributes to the longitudinal resistivity along @xmath31direction .",
    "interestingly , three new terms are obtained : 1 ) a current perpendicular to the film induces an electric field in @xmath2 direction ( the @xmath32-term ) .",
    "2 ) a current along @xmath2 direction generates an electric field in @xmath19 direction ( @xmath33-term ) .",
    "3 ) the @xmath34-term says that resistance of the film depends on @xmath35 linearly .",
    "of course , the coefficients of these terms depend , in principle , on @xmath1 .",
    "it should be pointed out that the interfacial effects are very common in physics .",
    "@xcite generally speaking , all new terms should exist in polycrystalline magnetic films .",
    "of course , their values depend on microscopic interactions that lead to these terms .",
    "however , these terms are not the subjects of this study although they deserve a careful and in - depth investigation @xcite . we shall only concentrate on amr and ahe in eq . .",
    "let us come back to dc - voltage in the electrical detection of fmr in which electric current density @xmath36 comes from the rf electric field only , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are respectively the microwave frequency and the phase lag of the electric current with the electric field .",
    "@xmath38 is a material parameter that depends on the complex electric conductivity .",

    "@xmath41 is the phase difference between the rf electric field and @xmath42 inside the sample , and its value depends on the particular experimental setup and the material parameters like dielectric constant .",
    "for example , @xmath43 in those experiments @xcite in which the rf magnetic field is generated by the rf electric current .",
    "however , in other experiments @xcite with microwave cavities , @xmath41 differs from @xmath38 .",
    "since both @xmath38 and @xmath41 are material parameters and depend on experimental setup , we will treat them as input parameters .",

    "@xmath53 reads as @xmath54 where the first and the second terms on the right - hand side ( rhs ) come from the amr and the last two terms arise respectively from the ordinary and anomalous hall effects .",
    "it is convenient to define a cartesian coordinate system @xmath55 , where @xmath31axis is along @xmath40 .",

    "] ] once the phase difference @xmath58 between @xmath59 and @xmath42 is given by experimental setup and material parameters , the dc - voltage depends on how @xmath45 responds to @xmath42 , or the dynamic magnetic susceptibility near fmr .",
    "it is important to obtain the dynamic magnetic susceptibility @xmath60 because the dc - voltage in electrical detection of fmr depends on @xmath60 . under a microwave radiation , magnetization precession",
    "is governed by the landau - liftshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation@xcite : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the effective field which includes the applied static magnetic field @xmath3 , rf magnetic field @xmath63 and anisotropy field .",
    "@xmath64 is the gilbert damping coefficient .",
    "this is a nonlinear equation that has many interesting physics , including spin wave emission by magnetic domain wall motion @xcite , and can only be solved for a few special issues @xcite . however ,",

    "since the total energy of a system can not increase or decrease indefinitely , the time average of the energy change rate should be zero , @xmath74 so that the average microwave absorption ( by the sample ) rate @xmath75 should be equal to energy dissipation rate @xcite .",

    "this finding may explain why the polder tensor was so widely misused in analyses . although the dynamic magnetic susceptibility and dc - voltage near the fmr should depend on , in principle , the magnetic anisotropy , we show that they are fully determined by a few parameters instead of a function .",

    "our results provide a reliable way to extract the dc - voltage induced by spin pumping and the ishe .",
