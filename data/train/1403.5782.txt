    "we consider the generalized veneziano amplitude  @xcite and its application in analyses of decays of heavy quarkonia .",
    "specifically we focus on the decays of vector charmonia , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath0 and @xmath1 to three pions .",
    "decays of charmonia have been investigated by markii , cleo , babar , bes and more recently by besiii  @xcite .",
    "one of the original motivations was to verify perturbative qcd  @xcite .",
    "the qcd calculations are based on the assumption that the initial quarkonium wave function and the wave functions of the light hadrons in the final state factorize .",
    "the latter is supposed to be produced through a calculable short distance process that follows annihilation of the @xmath2 pair .",
    "the predicted ratio of branching ratios , @xmath3 appears , however , to be significantly above the the measurements , which determine this ratio to be of the order of @xmath4 .",
    "the di - pion spectrum is dominated by the @xmath5 resonance and this so - called @xmath6 puzzle still remains largely unresolved  @xcite .",
    "to better understand its origin may require gaining further information about @xmath2 wave functions and/or light quark production dynamics .",
    "these can be determined , at least indirectly , by comparing microscopic model predictions with measurements of charmonium couplings to light quark resonances other then the @xmath5 meson . in this paper",
    "we discuss methods for determining these couplings .",
    "to be able to determine which resonances are produced in a given reaction it is necessary to perform a partial wave analysis ( pwa ) . while the full reaction amplitude is a function of the energies , momenta and helicities of external particles , partial waves emerge after the amplitude is projected onto waves with well defined angular momenta .",
    "these are associated with resonances appearing in the intermediate states . in data",
    "analysis , partial waves are often used from the start without reference to the underlying reaction amplitude . a finite sum of partial waves , however , can not reproduce singularities of the full amplitude and analyses based solely on a model for partial waves are insensitive to a large set of dynamical constraints . without prior knowledge , using only the energy dependence of a single partial wave , it is difficult to determine resonance parameters unambiguously . on the other hand the full amplitude does in principle contain information about all resonances .",
    "in particular the asymptotic behavior in the cross - channel energy variable is given by the leading regge pole of the direct channel partial waves .",
    "partial waves possess a rich analytical structure which extends beyond the energy dependence at fixed angular momentum .",
    "they are analytical functions of complex angular momentum and the motion of singularities in the angular momentum plane as a function of energy gives a connection between resonances of varying spins and masses .",
    "this connection is specific to the underlying dynamics responsible for resonance formation .",
    "for example , a linear rise of a regge pole trajectory is a manifestation of confinement and is related to the existence of an infinite number of bound states .    while it is unknown how to construct reaction amplitudes that take full advantage of s - matrix constraints ,",
    "when applicable , the veneziano model and its various extensions are a good starting point in developing amplitude models . in this paper , using the veneziano model , we want to show how important it is to go beyond individual partial waves and to illustrate the benefits of considering the full amplitude by applying the model to the specific case of charmonium decays .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ m ]",
    "we give a brief description of the veneziano model .",
    "there is an extensive literature on the subject and for more details we refer the reader to  @xcite and references therein . in section  [ rp ]",
    "we discuss the procedure used to isolate selected poles .",
    "the amplitudes obtained in this section are used in section  [ an ] to analyze di - pion mass distributions from charmonium decays . summary and outlook are given in section  [ sum ] .",
    "properties of the veneziano model will be illustrated by considering the decays of vector charmonia , @xmath0 and @xmath1 to three pions , @xmath7 .",
    "for simplicity , we neglect the pion mass since @xmath8 : in units of gev , @xmath9 is the mass squared of the decaying particle .",
    "the generalization to other reactions that involve four external particles is in principle straightforward and a number of 2-to-2 and 1-to-3 process have been considered this way in the past .",
    "it is worth noting that the original paper by veneziano  @xcite deals with another vector - to - three pion decay , namely @xmath10 .",
    "the main difference between @xmath11 and charmonium decays is that in the latter the @xmath12 phase space is significantly larger and direct production of several di - pion resonances above the @xmath5 is possible .    in the veneziano model",
    "the amplitude @xmath13 , describing a decay of a vector meson with momentum @xmath14 and helicity @xmath15 to three pions , @xmath16 , after the isospin tensor @xmath17 has been factored out , is given by @xmath18 .",
    "\\label{a}\\ ] ] here @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the standard mandelstam variables , @xmath21 and the scalar functions @xmath22 are given by @xmath23 with @xmath24 being positive integers and @xmath25 .",
    "the lower limit on @xmath26 guarantees that @xmath27 has the expected high - energy behavior ( see below ) and the upper limit eliminates double poles in overlapping channels . the leading , linear regge trajectory @xmath28",
    "is denoted by @xmath29 for short .",
    "finally @xmath30 is a kinematical factor , @xmath31 originating from presence of an odd - number of pions ( unnatural parity ) in the final state .",
    "the veneziano formula exhibits the expected behavior of the amplitude in the large-@xmath32 limit , with the qcd boson spectrum saturated by narrow resonances and confinement resulting in linear regge trajectories .",
    "this spectrum is manifested in the singularities of the amplitudes @xmath33 , which have simple poles . for given @xmath34",
    ", there is an infinity of @xmath35-channel poles labeled by a nonnegative integer @xmath36 that are located at @xmath37 , satisfying    @xmath38    in the vicinity of the pole the amplitude @xmath33 is given by @xmath39 where the residue , @xmath40 is a polynomial in @xmath41 of the order @xmath42 .",
    "we thus conclude that for each @xmath36 the full amplitude of eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) , in each channel ( @xmath35 , @xmath41 and @xmath20 ) , describes a finite number of degenerate , narrow ( zero ) width resonances that have spins in the range , @xmath43 . the additional unit of angular momentum arrises from the angular dependence of the kinematic factor @xmath30 . the integers @xmath34 and @xmath26 determine which resonances contribute ( poles ) to the amplitude .",
    "it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ pole],[b ] ) that amplitudes with @xmath44 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath45 , have poles whose location is determined by the leading trajectory and from all subsequent daughter trajectories .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath46 have poles originating from the @xmath47 daughter and subsequent daughters , @xmath48 from the @xmath49 and all subsequent daughters , _ etc . _",
    "the daughter trajectories are defined by , @xmath50 so that the leading trajectory @xmath51 corresponds to @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the @xmath47 daughter and so on .",
    "the trajectories and the spectrum are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - spectrum ] .",
    "spectrum in the @xmath35-channel of the generalized veneziano amplitude model of eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) .",
    "the leading and daughter regge trajectories are marked by thin solid lines and the resonances by dots at integer values of the spin @xmath54 marked on the vertical axis .",
    "the dashed and dotted lines are drawn to illustrate which resonance contribute to two amplitudes , chosen to be @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively . all ( infinite number ) of resonances on , and to the right of the dashed line contribute to @xmath55 , and all resonances on , and to the right of the dotted line contribute to @xmath56 . in the plot ,",
    "parameters of the trajectory , @xmath57 and @xmath58 were chosen arbitrarily . ]    for fixed-@xmath41 , the asymptotic behavior of @xmath33 at large-@xmath35 reflects the presence of an infinite number of resonances in the @xmath41-channel . using stirling s formula one finds , @xmath59 for large-@xmath35 the kinematical factor in eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) contributes an additional power of @xmath35 so that , the full amplitude has the expected regge limit , @xmath60 that arises from the leading , @xmath44 trajectory .",
    "as described in the preceding section , for given @xmath34 and @xmath26 the amplitude @xmath22 contains an infinite number of poles .",
    "since production of resonances is reaction dependent , it is necessary to find a mechanism that allows for the residues to be process dependent and in particular for the possibility that some of them vanish if a resonance formation is forbidden , _",
    "e.g _ by a conservation law .",
    "one possibility is to consider linear combinations @xmath61 the coefficients @xmath62 need to be chosen in such a way that @xmath63 s only couples to resonances that contribute to the process in question . in the case considered here , of an isoscalar boson decaying to three pions , isospin conservation demands each pair of pions to be produced in the isospin-1 state , which together with bose statistics forbids production of spin - even resonances in @xmath35 , @xmath41 and @xmath20 channels .    one way to proceed is to construct combinations of @xmath22 s that result in @xmath63 containing only a finite number of regge poles .",
    "as will be shown below , this requires an infinite number of terms in eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) . alternatively one can attempt data analysis with a finite number of linear combinations of the @xmath22 s and let the fit determine the coefficients @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "we find the first approach more appealing particularly in the context of resonance production .",
    "resonance properties are constrained by unitarity .",
    "this forces regge trajectories to be non - linear , but the veneziano model relies on trajectories that are real and linear .",
    "even though there are extensions of the veneziano model that introduce non - linear trajectories  @xcite , it is far simpler to implement unitarity at the level of an isolated regge pole  @xcite .",
    "an amplitude that contains only a finite number of resonance poles , however , does not reproduce the regge limit in the crossed channel . and it is important to preserve the asymptotic behavior since it helps constraining the background under directly produced resonances . thus to take the full advantage of the veneziano model , we will , at the end , need to consider an infinite number of poles . before we impose the asymptotic behavior on the forms given by eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) , it is nevertheless useful to ask what choice of @xmath62 s produces an @xmath63 that contains only a finite number of resonance poles . since the @xmath64 amplitudes contain an infinite number of poles , in order to cancel all , but a finite number of them , an infinite number of @xmath62 s in eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) must be non - vanishing .",
    "it is not difficult to find a relation between the coefficients that decouples all , but a finite number of poles .",
    "consider , for example , keeping only the pole at @xmath65 , _",
    "i.e. _ at @xmath66 .",
    "this pole is only present in the amplitude @xmath67 since amplitudes with @xmath68 have poles at @xmath69 ( _ cf . _",
    "[ fig - spectrum ] ) .",
    "there is only one amplitude @xmath70 so a single coefficient @xmath71 determines the residue and ultimately coupling to the pole at @xmath72 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath67 , however , also has poles at higher masses located at @xmath73 with residues that are polynomials in @xmath41 of the order of @xmath74 , respectively . if we only want to keep the pole at @xmath65 , these higher mass poles of @xmath67 must be canceled by the same poles in amplitudes @xmath22 with @xmath75 .",
    "specifically , the pole in @xmath67 at @xmath76 can only by canceled by the same pole in the two amplitudes : @xmath77 , @xmath78 , since for @xmath79 no other @xmath22 contains this pole .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath55 and @xmath80 are polynomials in @xmath41 of the order of @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "we can therefore uniquely determine the two coefficients , @xmath83 and @xmath84 in terms of @xmath71 so that the first order polynomial in @xmath41 at the @xmath85 pole of @xmath67 is identical to the first order polynomial @xmath41 at the pole of @xmath55 and @xmath80 .",
    "this way we can make the sum of residues between the three amplitudes , @xmath86 and @xmath80 at the pole @xmath87 vanish identically . similarly , at the @xmath88 pole of @xmath67 , the residue is an @xmath89 polynomial in @xmath41 .",
    "this pole is also present in @xmath55 and @xmath80 with residues order , @xmath89 and @xmath81 polynomials , respectively , and it is also present in @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 with residues of the order of @xmath89 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "with @xmath83 and @xmath84 already fixed , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 are now uniquely determined in terms of @xmath71 by the requirement that the total residue of the @xmath88 pole , which is an @xmath89 polynomial in @xmath41 , vanishes .",
    "continuing in this way all poles in @xmath35 satisfying @xmath96 can be eliminated .",
    "it is easy to check that this is achieved by setting , for @xmath75 @xmath97 the resulting amplitude @xmath63 is then given by @xmath98 where the subscript indicates the location of the pole .",
    "this simple result could have been anticipated .",
    "the combination of the @xmath99 functions in @xmath33 can be written as an infinite sums of simple poles in @xmath35 .",
    "the amplitude is symmetric in @xmath35 and @xmath41 , therefore if all poles but the one at @xmath100 are left , by @xmath101 symmetry @xmath63 must also contain a pole in @xmath41 but not a double pole .",
    "this leaves eq .",
    "( [ a=1 ] ) as the only possibility .",
    "as expected once the infinite number of poles has been eliminated @xmath63 no longer exhibits the regge limit .",
    "we will return to this point in the following subsection .",
    "this elimination procedure can be generalized to produce amplitudes with isolated poles at any higher , integer value of @xmath29 for example , to construct an amplitude with a single pole in @xmath35 at @xmath102 , one starts with the three amplitudes @xmath103 , @xmath104 and determines the coefficients @xmath62 for @xmath105 in terms of @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 that remove all poles at @xmath106 .",
    "the most general structure of the amplitude with the pole at @xmath107 only is therefore given by @xmath108 the first factor in the numerator guarantees that @xmath109 does not have the double pole at @xmath110 .",
    "it is followed by a product of two monomials in @xmath111 that generate @xmath89 polynomial in @xmath35 or @xmath41 at the pole located at @xmath112 or @xmath113 , respectively .",
    "having three parameters @xmath114 , @xmath104 determining the amplitude @xmath115 enables to decompose the residue in terms of an arbitrary linear combination of partial waves with @xmath116 .",
    "we note , however , that once the kinematic factor @xmath30 is taken into account , _ cf . _",
    "( [ a ] ) , the @xmath102 pole actually represents ( narrow ) resonances with spins @xmath117 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath114 , @xmath104 can therefore be chosen to decouple the @xmath118 isobar .",
    "in general we find that an amplitude @xmath119 , which has a single pole at @xmath120 or @xmath121 is given by @xmath122      the large - s behavior of the amplitude @xmath119 , is given by @xmath123 .",
    "the expected , regge asymptotic behavior , however , should be @xmath124 , _ cf . _ eqs .",
    "( [ as1],[regge ] ) .",
    "the regge behavior can only emerge from an infinite number of poles , therefore we need to modify the procedure outlined above and allow for an infinite number of poles to be present in @xmath63 .",
    "if we include an infinite number of poles located at say , @xmath125 where @xmath126 is chosen such that @xmath127 , ( @xmath128 is the regge trajectory slope ) , these poles will contribute a smooth background in the decay region .    with the @xmath129 s given by eq .",

    "( [ a = n ] ) to an amplitude with proper regge asymptotics is given by @xmath140    in the following we use these amplitudes to describe @xmath141 and @xmath1 , three pion decays .",
    "both , the @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays show a clear signal of @xmath5 production . in additional",
    "there is indication of higher mass resonance production in @xmath1 decays .",
    "this is not necessarily the case in @xmath0 decays , nevertheless the single @xmath5 does not saturate the spectrum either . in the past we attempted to describe the @xmath0 decay distribution with additional partial waves .",
    "we found that interference effects are strong and even after adding @xmath142 interactions up to @xmath143 the description remained quite poor . continuing to expand the partial wave basis to cover even higher mass region would lead to a quite unconstrained analysis . on the other hand with the amplitudes developed in this paper ,",
    "all partial waves are related to the same regge trajectory and that gives a very strong constraint on amplitude analysis .",
    "we will thus attempt to fit the di - pion mass distribution using a combination of amplitudes given by eq .",
    "( [ af ] ) truncated up to some maximal value of @xmath144 . for di - pion mass",
    "up to @xmath145 which is accessible in @xmath1 decay , resonances with masses corresponding to @xmath34 up to @xmath146 can be directly produced .",
    "we have found however that when using only the di - pion mass projection the fit is quite insensitive to amplitudes with @xmath34 larger than @xmath147 . in the following",
