    "the motivation of this paper is to enrich the class of _ non - elementary amenable _ groups .",
    "a group @xmath0 is amenable if there exists a finitely additive translation invariant probability measure on all subsets of @xmath0 .",
    "this definition was given by john von neumann , @xcite , in a response to banach - tarski , and hausdorff paradoxes .",
    "he singled out the property of a group which forbids paradoxical actions .",
    "the class of _ elementary amenable groups _ , denoted by @xmath1 , was introduced by mahlon day in @xcite , as the smallest class of groups that contain finite and abelian groups and is closed under taking subgroups , quotients , extensions and directed unions .",
    "the fact that the class of amenable groups is closed under these operations was already known to von neumann , @xcite , who noted at that at that time there was no known amenable group which did not belong to @xmath1 .",
    "no substantial progress in understanding this class has been made until the  80s , when chou , @xcite , showed that all elementary amenable groups have either polynomial or exponential growth , and rostislav grigorchuk , @xcite gave an example of a group with intermediate growth .",
    "grigorchuk s group served as a starting point in developing the theory of groups with intermediate growth , all of them being non - elementary amenable . in",
    "the same paper chou showed that every simple finitely generated infinite group is not elementary amenable .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the topological full group of cantor minimal system is amenable . by the results of matui , @xcite , this group has a simple and finitely generated commutator subgroup , in particular , it is not elementary amenable .",
    "this was the first example of infinite simple finitely generated amenable group .",
    "currently there are only two sources of non - elementary amenable groups : groups acting on rooted trees and topological full groups of cantor minimal systems . in @xcite",

    "we describe an explicit generating set , and give a simple direct proof .",
    "subsequent paper  @xcite gives a less direct proof of the finite generation of special subgroups @xmath7 of the topological full groups in the case of expansive action .",
    "the groups @xmath7 are closely related to the derived subgroups of the full groups ( in particular , they coincide in the case of the actions of abelian groups ) , but precise relation is still not well understood .",
    "it was proved in @xcite , that the commutator subgroup of @xmath6 $ ] is simple .",
    "the topological full groups that correspond to interval exchange transformation group were studied in @xcite .",
