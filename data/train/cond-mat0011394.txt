    "decades after the original proposal,@xcite and after the first successful measurement , @xcite the frictional drag effect between separated but coupled electron subsystems is still attracting a lot of interest . in part",
    "this is due to the possibility of a direct view of interactions between charged carriers , which play a key role in central questions of condensed matter physics like superconductivity and quantum hall effects . after the initial theories based on the direct coulomb drag mechanism,@xcite electron - electron interactions mediated by other channels , such as phonon exchange @xcite and electron - phonon collective modes,@xcite",
    "have been explored as sources of frictional drag at low temperatures .",
    "however , recent experiments showed that further theoretical developments are still necessary before obtaining a quantitative view of this problem@xcite . at intermediate temperatures ,",
    "the importance of plasmons has been predicted theoretically by flensberg _",
    "et al _ , @xcite and confirmed experimentally by hill _",
    "et al _ , @xcite but",
    "the discrepancies between theoretical and experimental results are significant .",
    "gven and tanatar @xcite made a detailed consideration of the optical phonon contribution to the plasmon drag , and obtained an improvement on the theoretical result for the case where optical phonons are of little importance on the drag force due to difficulty of exciting them @xcite at temperatures where plasmons dominate .",
    "at the same time some studies concluded that the rpa should be substituted by more detailed many - body theories @xcite when estimating the frictional force . besides those studies focusing on the mechanism of frictional drag between 2d-2d electron - electron fermi gas subsystems , intensive theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite works have been done on a 2d-2d electron - hole fermi gas , and also in other cases @xcite .",
    "most works on coulomb drag are made in the linear regime , in such a way that the temperature is assumed to be the same for the two subsystems , and equal to that of the heat bath .",
    "it is well - known , however , that hot electron effects occur in semiconductor microstructures@xcite , where electrons can be easily heated or cooled by very low electric voltage or photon excitations . in",
    "non - equilibrium situations , as it is the case in a coulomb drag experiment , there is no reason to assume , from the very beginning , the two system at the same temperature of the heat bath .",
    "the question of thermalization of non - equilibrium systems is of interest also in several other fields in physics @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the frictional drag in the non - equilibrium regime resulting from the direct coulomb interaction , the e - e interaction mediated by virtual and real ta and la phonons , optic phonons , plasmons , and ta and la phonon - electron collective modes .",
    "the frictional drag is described by a non - equilibrium green s function method , which has been applied successfully in the development of quantum transport theory in semiconductors .",
    "we believe that allowing in the calculation different temperatures for the two systems , what is the central point in the present work , a new viewpoint is brought to this developing area .    in the lei - ting formalism",
    "@xcite used to describe non - linear transport in semiconductor structures , the balance equations are established by separating the center - of - mass from the relative motion . the hamiltonian becomes @xmath0 , where @xmath1 corresponds to the motion of the center - of - mass , @xmath2 corresponds to the time developing part due to external field , @xmath3 is the hamiltonian of relative electron system , and @xmath4 represents the scattering by impurities and phonons . the last term is the one which causes the dissipation of momentum and energy .    in order to obtain the equation of motion for the density matrix , we take as initial state an equilibrium state of a system free of the interactions @xmath5 and @xmath2 . the real system is obtained by adiabatically switching on @xmath4 and @xmath2 at the infinite past time , till the present non - equilibrium state .",
    "then , the final state density matrix of the relative electron system can be expanded in terms of the density matrix of the initial state .",
    "if we choose a proper initial state close to the final state of the relative electron system , a good result can be reached by keeping only the term in first order of perturbation .",
    "this approach has made the lei - ting balance equation an efficient tool to calculate the non - linear transport properties in semiconductors , since the numerical calculation involved is greatly simplified .",
    "however , this technique has not yet been employed in the electron - electron frictional drag phenomena , mostly because of the complexity of the many - body effect due to the inter - subsystem electron - electron interaction .",
    "we noticed that the @xmath4 is important for configuring the ensembles of the system for this problem , so higher order terms must be considered . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not convenient to include those higher order terms in the usual version of the formalism . in this paper",
    ", we propose a way to circumvent this difficulty in the case of the frictional drag problem .",
    "the hamiltonian is written as@xmath6 , with ensemble average density matrices @xmath7 and @xmath8 corresponding to @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",

    "the validity of this approximation is the same as in the standard version , as we can see by considering the hamiltonian @xmath21 and expanding @xmath8 in terms of @xmath22 .",

    "we start by considering the interaction only through the coulomb electron - electron ( e - e ) potential .    as in the original lei - ting balance equation formalism",
    ", we choose an initial equilibrium system composed of independent subsystems ( electron gases in well 1 and 2 , and phonons ) in the hamiltonian @xmath50 , with the initial density matrix @xmath51 . for the density matrix of the final relative electrons of the hamiltonian @xmath52 , we use @xmath53 , which we assume to be close to the steady state of the relative electrons .",
    "the reason why we include @xmath54 into the density matrix is that the e - e interaction , which is very special and much stronger than other interactions such as electron - impurity and electron - phonon interaction , should give important contributions to the ensemble average for the final state of the relative electrons .",

    "we believe that local field corrections to our result give similar results as discussed in other places .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that effects of the optic phonon directly causing , or mediating , the frictional drag were considered in refs . and . here",
    "the optic phonon contribution is taken into account just by using the static dielectric constant @xmath101 as the background dielectric function.@xcite an argument in favor of this assumption is that the plasmon energy is much smaller than those of optic phonons , and at the plasma frequency the optic phonon contribution to dielectric function is practically frequency independent .",

    "the calculation is performed in a range of values of @xmath116 and @xmath117  suitable for analyzing the relative importance of the electron - phonon collective mode for the la and ta phonons .",
    "the solid lines represent results of different values of the phonon mean free paths ( the same for la and ta phonons ) , namely @xmath118 .  in the two upper curves ( @xmath119,@xmath120 ) the electron - phonon collective modes",
    "dominate the contribution . in the lower curve ( @xmath121 )",
    ", however the main contribution comes from the virtual and real phonon terms .",
    "similarly to previous studies@xcite , our theoretical results fit qualitatively well the experimental data from ref .",
    "( filled circles ) , but several quantitative inconsistencies still remain . for instance , at low temperatures the calculated peak of the acoustic phonon",
    "is displaced to the high temperature side .",
    "if we allow @xmath122 and @xmath123 to be different and diminish the value of @xmath122 to reduce the contribution of la phonons , the peak moves to the low temperature side . in dotted line , we show the drag resistivity including only the contributions of  the ta phonons ( @xmath124 ) , together with the coulomb interaction . comparing with the experimental result ,",
    "this seems to indicate that ta phonons have a longer mean free path then la phonon , which can result in the dominance of ta phonons in the frictional drag force as mentioned in ref .",
    "however , even though the position of the calculated peak can coincide with the experimentally observed by fitting @xmath122 and @xmath123 , the value of the maximum can not reach the experimental result in this low carrier density case . at intermediate temperatures ( @xmath125 ) ,",
    "the plasmon begin to dominate the contribution to frictional drag force , which reaches its maximum at about ( @xmath126 , as calculated in ref",
    "our conclusion is that the la phonons enhance the plasmon peak at intermediate temperatures , in the same way as the optic phonon , @xcite , while the ta phonons have little influence at this temperature range .",
    "however , our calculation gives a smaller frictional drag force , and a higher peak temperature than what is observed experimentally . in fig .",
    "2(b ) , we show the dependence of the drag resistivity on the temperature , as in fig .",
    "2(a ) , with a different carrier density , @xmath127 , and several ta and la mean free paths , namely , @xmath128 .",
    "differently from the previous low density regime , we find a very short phonon mean free path , @xmath129 , when fitting the experimental result .",
    "since samples differing just by the carrier densities are expected to have the same order of the phonon mean free path , this points to a disagreement between theoretical and experimental results for the density dependence of the frictional drag force .",
    "if the la phonon is excluded from the calculation , as denoted by the dotted curve , even a very long mean free path for ta phonon , @xmath130 , results in a very small frictional drag force .",
    "next , we relax the condition @xmath131 , allowing for the driving well to have a different temperature from that of the drag well . in fig .",
    "3(a ) and ( b ) we calculate the dependence of the drag resistivity on the normalized temperature divided by the fermi temperature of the drag well , @xmath132 .",
    "electrons in the drag well are assumed in thermal equilibrium with the phonons .",
    "curves are plotted for different ratios @xmath133  .",
    "it is found that a small change of that temperature ratio affects little the phonon drag peak at low temperatures , but modifies greatly the plasmon peak at intermediate temperatures . when the driving electrons are cooler than the drag electrons , the frictional drag force increases greatly . in the reverse case",
    "the plasmon peak diminishes , or even disappears . if we take a detailed look at the frictional drag , given by eq.([tr ] _ )",
    "_ , we find that the changes introduced by non - equilibrium come mainly from the second term .",
    "it reflects the modification of the correlation function by the drift energy of electrons in the driving well , and it is of second order in the equilibrium .    in fig .",
    "4(a ) we calculate the non - equilibrium drag resistivity divided by that obtained in equilibrium , as a function of the temperature ratio @xmath134 , at various @xmath135 , in the case of matching densities @xmath136 . at low temperatures ( @xmath137 ) ,",
    "a small change on the temperature of the driving electron gas makes little effect on the value @xmath138 , as shown by the almost flat solid curve at @xmath139 . at higher temperatures ,",

    "4(b ) as functions of the temperature of the drag well .",
    "results are also shown for the matching electron density @xmath115 .",
    "the sensitivity of the plasmon contribution to the temperature difference @xmath140 is a direct result of the non - linearity of the correlation function over frequency , confirming that a correct approach to the coulomb drag effect must contain the non - equilibrium assertive of the present work .",
    "where @xmath144 .",

    "the contribution from acoustic phonons comes mainly from @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is a linear function of @xmath80 in the range of the corresponding phonon energy ( with the parameters used in this paper ) .",
    "this leads to the fact that the acoustic peak in fig .",
    "3 does not show any non - equilibrium trace . on the other hand ,",
    "the plasmon energy is higher than the energy of the single particle excitation , and the corresponding non - linearity of @xmath152 invokes strong non - equilibrium character for drag resistivity @xmath148 due to plasmons .",
    "5 shows the drag resistivity @xmath148 in equilibrium cases ( solid curves ) as a function of the ratio @xmath153 of the electron densities at different drag temperatures , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , and @xmath158 in comparison with the experimental results .",

    "the results with bare coulomb interaction is shown in equilibrium cases by dotted curves , and in non - equilibrium cases with @xmath161 by dashed curves .    in conclusion",
    ", we have studied the momentum transfer rate between two nearby separated electron gases , which are coupled via the coulomb interaction and phonon mediated interaction .",
    "we focused on the non - equilibrium configuration , and a theory was developed to describe the frictional drag force felt by one electron gas as a result of the relative drift of the other , taking into account the possibility of difference on the subsystems temperatures .",
    "it was found that a cooler ( hotter ) driving electron gas greatly enhances ( decreases ) the frictional force caused by plasmons .",
    "this behavior results from the fact the plasmons locate in a region of the @xmath162 space where the correlation function shows a nonlinear frequency dependence , and they modifies little the acoustic phonons force because the latter are important mainly in the region of the energy - momentum space where the correlation function is linear with the frequency .",
