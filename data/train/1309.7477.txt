    "we provide exact formulae for length sets , delta sets , and catenary degrees .    although elements in leamer monoids are arithmetic sequences in @xmath1 of a fixed step size , the atomic properties of @xmath0 differ greatly from the numerical monoid @xmath1 from which they are derived .",
    "in particular , many of the computable invariants for numerical monoids ( e.g.  delta sets , see  @xcite ) are harder to establish in leamer monoids . thus , investigating special cases ( i.e.  arithmetical leamer monoids ) becomes both necessary and fruitful .",
