    "the study of magnetotransport in two dimensional ( 2d ) electronic systems regained considerable interest since the observation of kravchenko _ et al . _ @xcite that the resistance of high mobility , high density silicon mosfets decreases and saturates to a residual value as the temperature is reduced .",

    "@xcite the conflict between ref .",

    "\\(d ) large , positive magnetoresistance for magnetic fields parallel to the layer .",
    "\\(e ) a crossover from metallic to insulating characteristics for large enough parallel magnetic fields .",
    "the zero field crossover from metallic to insulating behavior was identified by some authors as a second order phase transition .",
    "@xcite scaling theory has been constructed @xcite and even reentrant transition to an insulating phase , at still higher densities , has been argued to occur for holes in gaas .",
    "@xcite    notwithstanding the remarkable similarities between the magnetoresistance and temperature / density dependences of the different material systems and samples listed above , some gross differences should be appreciated :    \\(i ) while the weak field magnetoresistance in silicon samples is negative in all regimes , it is positive for holes in gaas in most of the metallic regime ( high carrier concentration ) .",
    "\\(ii ) while only single band is observed in silicon samples , the 2dhg in gaas samples , in most of the metallic regime , is characterized by two distinct bands .",
    "these bands are manifested in two shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) frequencies , as well as in classical , positive magnetoresistance .",
    "\\(iii ) the relative resistance change with temperature in different materials vary between about 1% for electrons in gaas to an order of magnitude in silicon mosfets .",
    "\\(iv ) the `` critical resistance '' at the mit varies substantially from sample to sample and between different material systems .",
    "in contrast to some early claims it can deviate substantially from one resistance quantum @xcite .",
    "\\(v ) the large effect of back gating in gaas 2dhg @xcite is absent for electrons in silicon @xcite or is at least very different @xcite .",
    "the extent to which the magnetotransport in different 2d systems is universal is hence unclear at this point .",
    "the multivalley band structure of silicon , the short range potential fluctuations in silicon as opposed to the long range ones in gaas , the strong spin - orbit coupling in iii - v materials , not to mention obvious differences in effective masses and zeeman factors , might all turn out to be important .",
    "a wide spectrum of mechanisms has been proposed to account for these features , including a new type of superconductivity , @xcite a novel metallic phase induced by disorder enhanced interactions @xcite ( this direction is based on the earlier works in ref .  ) , wigner glass and non - fermi liquid , @xcite a new liquid phase , @xcite impurity scattering , @xcite temperature dependent screening , @xcite spin effects , @xcite interband scattering , @xcite band structure effects , @xcite and classical percolation .",

    "@xcite we reported magnetotransport measurements done on a high mobility 2dhg sample .",
    "concentrating on the high density regime we were able to show that the metallic characteristics result from inelastic scattering between the two heavy hole bands split by the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the positive magnetoresistance observed in that sample was fully accounted for by the well known classical two band formulae @xcite and the resistance increase with temperature was shown to result from the enhancement of coulomb scattering between the two spin - orbit split bands .",
    "that work thus explained the metallic characteristics with well known semiconductor physics without invoking a novel metallic phase or any other `` new '' physics .",

    "the data conform with previous magnetotransport measurements on 2dhg .",
    "@xcite careful analysis then shows that well - known physics accounts for all data .",
    "the emerging picture is briefly as follows .",
    "it is well known , both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite , that the bulk heavy hole band in assymmetric gaas / algaas heterostructures is split by spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the resulting sub - bands are manifested by two sdh frequencies , as well as by a classical , lorentzian shaped , positive magnetoresistance ( pmr ) .",
    "the band splitting energy , @xmath0 , vanishes at @xmath1 and increases with @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite at low densities , when @xmath0 at the fermi energy is small and the elastic scattering time , @xmath3 , is short , @xmath4 , the two bands are strongly mixed and spin - orbit splitting is unimportant .",
    "the resulting magnetoresistance is negative and dominated by weak localization ( wl ) and hole - hole coulomb interaction . as the temperature",
    "is increased , these quantum corrections are suppressed and the sample becomes more conductive . at high densities ,",
    "the sub - band splitting is large and @xmath3 is long , thus @xmath5 .",
    "the two sub - bands are hence distinguishable .",
    "the weak field magnetoresistance is positive and dominated by weak anti - localization ( wal ) induced by inter sub - band scattering ( effectively , spin - orbit scattering ) , hole - hole interaction ( altshuler - aronov correction @xcite ) , and classical two band magnetoresistance .",
    "a slightly higher magnetic field suppresses the quantum corrections in the cooperon channel while the classical magnetoresistance persists . at still higher fields ,",
    "the classical magnetoresistance is also suppressed and the magnetoresistance turns negative due to hole - hole interaction in the diffuson channel .",
    "the metallic characteristic , @xmath6 , in the high density regime is traced to the enhancement of inelastic inter sub - band scattering as well as the suppression of quantum corrections ( especially the wal ) with increased temperature .",
    "the weight of quantum corrections relative to the classical effect depends on sample resistivity .",
    "the quantum corrections are negligible in high mobility samples and very important in the low mobility ones close to the mit .",
    "the weak temperature dependence of the resistivity at the mit merely reflects effective cancellation of the resistance increase with temperature due to inelastic interband scattering and suppression of wal , against resistance decrease with temperature due to the suppression of hole - hole interaction .",
    "our analysis thus explains how the sample crosses over from an insulator at low densities to a `` metal '' at higher densities .",
    "moreover , we account for the change from negative to positive magnetoresistance as the density is increased .",

    "the existence of two bands is manifested in three phenomena ; a lorentzian pmr , two sdh frequencies , and finally , wal correction to the conductivity . while the sdh frequencies merge into a single frequency when the gap becomes smaller than the scattering rate ( @xmath75 ) , the wal remains visible down to considerably smaller gaps provided the temperature is low enough .",

    "<S> the magnetotransport of two dimensional holes in a gaas / algaas heterostructure is studied experimentally and theoretically . </S>",
    "<S> spin - orbit splitting of the heavy hole band is manifested at high carrier densities in two shubnikov - de haas frequencies , classical positive magnetoresistance , and weak antilocalization . the latter effect combined with inelastic scattering between the spin - orbit split bands </S>",
    "<S> lead to metallic characteristics , namely resistance increase with temperature . at lower densities , </S>",
    "<S> when splitting is smaller than the inverse elastic scattering time , the two bands effectively merge to yield the expected insulating characteristics and negative magnetoresistance due to weak localization and interaction corrections to the conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> the `` metal to insulator '' transition at intermediate densities is found to be a smooth crossover between the two regimes rather than a quantum phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> two band calculations of conventional interference and interaction effects account well for the data in the whole parameter range . </S>"
