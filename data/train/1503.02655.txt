    "structural and dynamical parameters of gcs as described by surface brightness and velocity profiles can be fitted by a number of different models .",
    "the models include those of the empirical , single - mass , modified isothermal spheres @xcite , the isotropic multi - mass @xcite , the anisotropic multi - mass @xcite , and the power - law surface - density profiles @xcite . since the pioneer work of @xcite , three models are often used in the fits .",

    "@xcite considered that these clusters should be as close an analogy as possible to the halo clusters in the milky way .",
    "the observations used in the present work come from the _ hst _ programs 5914 , of which the sample star clusters were observed by the _ hst_/wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) in f555w and f814w bands .",

    "the parameters of the sample star clusters are listed in table 1 , which will be used in following sections .",
    "the data analysis procedures to measure surface brightness profiles of clusters have been described in @xcite . here",
    "we briefly summarize the procedures .",
    "surface photometries of each cluster were obtained from the drizzled images , using the iraf task ellipse .",
    "the center position of a sample cluster was fixed at a value derived by object locator of ellipse task , however an initial center position was determined by centroiding .",
    "elliptical isophotes were fitted to the data , with no sigma clipping .",
    "we ran two passes of ellipse task , the first pass was run in the usual way , with ellipticity and position angle allowed to vary with the isophote semimajor axis . in the second pass , surface brightness profiles on fixed , zero - ellipticity isophotes were measured , since we choose to fit circular models for the intrinsic cluster structure and the point spread function ( psf ) as @xcite did . in order to derive required smooth profiles by ellipse , we filtered the images of the sample clusters with an median filter except for r12 and r14 , since the profiles of these two clusters are smooth enough . as @xcite adopted , we filtered the images of the sample clusters with an @xmath7 @xmath8 median filter except for h10 and c20 . for c20 , we filtered its images with an @xmath9 @xmath8 median filter , and for h10 , we filtered its images with an @xmath10 @xmath8 median filter , in order to derive smooth profiles of these two clusters .",
    "figures 2 and 3 plot the ellipticity ( @xmath11 ) and position angle ( p.a . ) as a function of the semimajor axis ( @xmath12 ) in the f555w and f814w bands for the sample clusters .",
    "the errors were generated by the iraf task ellipse , in which the ellipticity errors were obtained from the internal errors in the harmonic fit , after removal of the first and second fitted harmonics .",
    "figure 2 shows that the ellipticities are generally large at small radii for most sample clusters .",
    "figure 3 shows that the position angles are occasionally wildly varying for some sample clusters .",
    "this is likely to be produced by internal errors in the ellipse . in the far outer parts of the clusters , the ellipticities and the position angles",
    "are poorly constrained due to the low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "it is true that the ellipticities are very different between small radii and large radii for most sample clusters .",
    "so , the final ellipticity and position angle for each cluster were calculated as the average of the values between 0.2 and 1.5 arcsec ( indicate by dashed lines in figures 2 and 3 ) obtained in the first pass of ellipse , where the quantities are more stable .",
    "table 1 lists the average ellipticity and position angle for every star cluster .",
    "errors correspond to the standard deviation of the mean .",
    "in addition , the ellipticities in the different bands are very different at small radii , since the random fluctuations due to individual stars make the fits meaningless at small radii .",
    "raw output from package ellipse is in terms of counts s@xmath13 pixel@xmath13 , which needs to multiply by @xmath14 to convert to counts s@xmath13 @xmath15 .",
    "a formula is used to transform counts to surface brightness in magnitude calibrated on the vegamag system ,    @xmath16    as noted by @xcite , occasional oversubtraction of background during the multidrizzling in the automatic reduction pipeline leads to `` negative '' counts in some pixels , so we worked in terms of linear intensity instead of surface brightness in magnitude . with updated absolute magnitudes of the sun @xmath17 from table 2 of @xcite , the equation for transforming counts to surface brightness in intensity",
    "is derived ,    @xmath18    converting from luminosity density in @xmath19 to surface brightness in magnitude was done according to @xmath20    the zeropoints , conversion factors , and coefficients used in these transformations for each filter are from table 2 of @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the final , calibrated intensity profiles for the sample gcs but with no extinction corrected are listed in table 2 .",
    "the reported intensities are calibrated on the vegamag scale . in table 2 ,",
    "column 6 gives a flag for each point , which has the same meaning as @xcite and @xcite defined .",
    "the points flagged with``ok '' are used to constrain the model fit , while the points flagged with `` dep '' are those that may lead to excessive weighting of the central regions of clusters ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "in addition , points marked with `` bad '' are those individual isophotes that deviated strongly from their neighbors or showed irregular features , which were deleted by hand .",
    "the psf models are critical to accurately measure the shapes of objects in images taken with _ hst",
    "_ @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we chose not to deconvolve the data , instead fitting structural models after convolving them with a simple analytic description of the psf as @xcite and @xcite did for m31 star clusters ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "a simple analytic description of the psfs for the wfpc2 bands has been given by @xcite , which will be adopted here .",
    "when we fit models to the surface brightness profiles of the sample clusters , we will correct the intensity profiles for extinction .",
    "the effective wavelengths of the wfpc2 f555w and f814w bands are @xmath21 5439.0 and 8012.2  @xcite . with the extinction curve @xmath22 taken from @xcite with @xmath23 , two formulas for computing @xmath24 and @xmath25 are derived : @xmath26 , and @xmath27 ( also see table 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , for easy comparison with catalogs of the gcs in the milky way ( see section 4 for details ) , we transform the wfpc2 magnitudes in the f555w band to the standard @xmath28 .",
    "@xcite has given transformations from wfpc2 to standard @xmath29 magnitudes both on observed and synthetic methods ( see their table 22 ) .",
    "as synthetic transformations are based on larger color range and more safely employed , they should be considered the norm , unless some indicated cases @xcite .",
    "we used the synthetic transformation from f555w to @xmath28 magnitude on the vegamag scale with a quadratic dependence on dereddened @xmath30 . with the magnitudes in @xmath28 and @xmath31 bands and reddening values listed in table 1 , we found the @xmath30 values of all the sample clusters",
    "are larger than 0.4 .",
    "so , the following transformation formula from @xcite was applied here , @xmath32 for which we estimated a precision of about @xmath33 mag .",
    "as @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite did , we used three structural models to fit star cluster surface profiles .",
    "these models are developed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ( hereafter `` king model '' , `` wilson model '' and `` srsic model '' ) .",
    "@xcite have described the three structural models in detail , here we briefly summarize some basic characteristics for them .",
    "king model is most commonly used in studies of star clusters , which is the simple model of single - mass , isotropic , modified isothermal sphere .",
    "wilson model is defined by an alternate modified isothermal sphere based on the ad hoc stellar distribution function of @xcite , which has more extended envelope structures than the standard king isothermal sphere @xcite .",
    "srsic model has an @xmath2 surface - density profile , which is used for parameterizing the surface brightness profiles of early - type galaxies and bulges of spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite found that some classical gcs in m31 which exhibit cuspy core profiles are well fitted by srsic model of index @xmath34 .",
    "the clusters with cuspy cores have usually been called post - core collapse ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .      after the intensity profiles were corrected for extinction ( see section 2.4 for details ) , we fitted models to the brightness profiles of the sample clusters .",
    "we first convolved the three models with psfs for the filters used .",
    "given a value for the scale radius @xmath35 , we compute a dimensionless model profile @xmath36 and then perform the convolution ,    @xmath37dx^\\prime dy^\\prime , \\label{eq : convol}\\ ] ]    where @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 was approximated using the equation ( 4 ) of @xcite ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",

    "the uncertainties of observed intensities listed in table 2 were used as weights .",
    "we plot the fitting for the sample clusters in figures 413 .",
    "the observed intensity profile with extinction corrected is plotted as a function of logarithmic projected radius .",
    "the open squares are the data points included in the model fitting , while the crosses are points flagged as `` dep '' or `` bad '' , which are not used to constrain the fit @xcite .",

    "the blue dashed lines represent the shapes of the psfs for the filters used .",
    "as @xcite did , the values of mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath1 values ) , which were used to derive the dynamical parameters , were determined from the population - synthesis models of @xcite , assuming a @xcite initial mass function .",
    "the ages and metallicities used to compute @xmath1 values in the @xmath28 band are listed in table 1 .",
    "the basic structural and various derived dynamical parameters of the best - fitting models for each cluster are listed in tables 35 , with a description of each parameter / column at the end of each table ( see * ? ? ? * for details of the calculation ) .",
    "the uncertainties of these parameters were estimated by calculating their variations in each model that yields @xmath41 within 1 of the global minimum for a cluster , while combined in quadrature with the uncertainties in @xmath1 for the parameters related to it ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .    at last , we constructed and listed the fundamental plane of the sample clusters in table 6 , defined by @xcite using mass surface density instead of luminosity surface density in the `` @xmath44 '' parameters defined by @xcite .",
    "@xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47      @xcite presented ellipticities , position angles and surface brightness profiles for four sample clusters ( h38 , m9 , r12 and u49 ) , and they also determined structural parameters using @xcite model fits for them .",
    "these authors used the same @xmath48 images as we used here .",
    "they filtered the images of the clusters with an @xmath7 @xmath8 median filter .",
    "@xcite presented the ellipticities to be less than @xmath49 for h38 , m9 and r12 comparing with @xmath49 for m9 and r12 and @xmath50 for h38 obtained here .",
    "@xcite presented the ellipticity of u49 to be @xmath51 comparing with @xmath52 obtained here .",
    "in fact , @xcite only plotted the distributions of ellipticities and position angles for four clusters between 0.45 and 4.2 arcsec , and did not calculate the average values .",
    "when we plot the distributions of ellipticities and position angles for them between 0.45 and 4.2 arcsec , we find that , except for r12 , the distributions of ellipticities and position angles for the other three sample clusters obtained here are in agreement with those of @xcite .",
    "we indicated in section 2.2 that we did not filter the images of r12 because its surface brightness profiles are smooth enough ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "however , beyond @xmath53 in the f555w band and @xmath54 in the f814w band , the ellipticity and the position angle of r12 can not be derived here because of low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "figure 14 compares the values of cluster parameters obtained here with those in @xcite , including the concentration @xmath55 , scale radius @xmath35 , and central surface brightness @xmath56 .",
    "it is evident that , in general , our results are in agreement with those derived by @xcite , and systematic differences are not found .",

    "however , when we calculate the final ellipticity of u137 as the average of the values between 0.5 and 1.5 arcsec as @xcite did , we derive the ellipticity of u137 to be 0.05 and 0.11 in the f555w and f814 bands , respectively , which are in good agreement with those of @xcite .      one eventual use for the material presented in section 3.2 should be to facilitate the comparison of dynamical star cluster @xmath1 values to the population - synthesis model values that we calculated here . for the star clusters of m33 , the determinations of @xmath1 values are very limited : only @xcite measured observed velocity dispersions for four sample clusters using high - dispersion spectra from the hires echelle spectrograph on the keck i telescope .",

    "figure 15 shows that there is generally good agreement between the observed and predicted velocity dispersions except for r12 .",
    "however , it is true that , because of the limited sample clusters , this conclusion should be confirmed based on a large sample objects . the mean ratio between the observed and",
    "predicted velocity dispersions is @xmath63 , with an interquartile range of @xmath64 .",

    "in addition , fits to clusters in the milky way are performed in the @xmath28 band , allowing us direct comparison without being concerned about possible color gradients ( see section 4 ) .      in order to determine which model can fit the structure of clusters best",

    "we discussed the properties of the sample gcs here combined with gcs in the milky way @xcite and m31 @xcite .",
    "in general , the properties of m33 , m31 and the galactic clusters fall in the same regions of parameter spaces .",
    "we investigated two forms of the fp , including the correlation of velocity dispersion , radius , and mass density , and the correlation of binding energy with the total model mass .",
    "the tight correlations of cluster properties indicate a tight fp for clusters , regardless of their host environments .",

    "<S> we obtained ellipticities , position angles and surface brightness profiles for them . </S>",
    "<S> in general , the ellipticities of m33 sample clusters are similar to those of m31 clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the structural and dynamical parameters are derived by fitting the profiles to three different models combined with mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath1 values ) from population - synthesis models . </S>",
    "<S> the structural parameters include core radii , concentration , half - light radii and central surface brightness . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical parameters include the integrated cluster mass , integrated binding energy , central surface mass density and predicted line - of - sight velocity dispersion at the cluster center . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity dispersions of four clusters predicted here agree well with the observed dispersions by larsen et al . </S>",
    "<S> the results here showed that the majority of the sample halo globular clusters are well fitted by king model as well as by wilson model , and better than by srsic model . in general </S>",
    "<S> , the properties of clusters in m33 , m31 and the milky way fall in the same regions of parameter spaces . </S>",
    "<S> the tight correlations of cluster properties indicate a `` fundamental plane '' for clusters , which reflects some universal physical conditions and processes operating at the epoch of cluster formation . </S>"
