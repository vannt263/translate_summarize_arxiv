    "results are shown in table  [ tab : weaksr ] for the 8600k , @xmath72 model .",
    "the abundances are up to a factor of 3 lower if the @xmath73 model is used , but the agreement between the first and second spectra is still within 0.1 dex for the lower microturbulence .",
    "the weaker , sri lines , which are less sensitive to microturbulence , magnetic broadening , and surface gravity give mean abundances of @xmath56.3 and @xmath56.4 for the lower and higher values of @xmath51 respectively .    we have not experimented extensively with stratification .",
    "the parameters used to get a fit for @xmath124077 ( see below ) give unacceptably high abundances from the weak sri lines .",
    "the `` standard '' stratification parameters , @xmath38 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 , reduces the abundance difference between the first and second spectra though only by a little , and the overall abundances increase by more than a dex .",
    "we conclude that a reasonable mean abundance for the atmosphere of hr 710 is @xmath76 .",
    "this is a factor of 2.5 higher than the abundance found by ryabchikova , et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for the strontium star @xmath11 equ .",
    "it comports well with our assertion , based on fig .",
    "[ fig:4305 ] , that strontium is somewhat stronger in hr 710 than @xmath11 equ .",
    ".abundances from weaker subordinate sr lines : 8600k , @xmath77.[tab : weaksr ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     our preferred values give @xmath78 , conveniently near the most probable observational value for white dwarf masses according to weidemann ( 1990 ) .",
    "this supports the assertion of czesla and schmitt ( 2007 ) that the secondary of hr 710aa  is clearly a very plausible candidate for the observed x - ray emission ... \" .",
    "these authors discuss a magnetically confined wind - shock model .",
    "bonsack ( 1981 ) also discussed a 15.88-day magnetic period . with @xmath79",
    ", this period leads to an equatorial velocity of 5.2kms@xmath4 , incompatible with the adopted @xmath80 . to reconcile this period with the observed @xmath80 , we would need to assume a stellar radius nearly double that used .",
    "this is not compatible with the luminosity of the star .",
    "the present work on hr 710 shows that it is difficult to explain the profiles of strong caii and srii lines with a simple abundance - stratified model .",
    "overall , we strongly support the stratification models , but find indications that refinements are necessary .",
    "different stratification parameters were required for the k - line and the irt of caii , while srii lines also required adjustments of the parameters for individual lines .",
    "it remains to be seen if theoretical work can explain the large elemental abundances of the best - fit stratification models .",
    "these require very high abundances in the deep photosphere in order to explain the observed , broad wings . in the case of calcium ,",
    "traditional diffusion calculations have explained low photospheric abundances ( am stars ) .    among a number of uncertainties in the present discussion",
    ", we note that our stratification model ( @xmath30 ) may ( a ) not have explored the optimum domains of parameter space , or ( b ) have been too simplistic . regarding the latter point , we note the sophisticated approach of kochukhov , et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .    eventually , it will prove necessary to approach the modeling of the spectra of these stars with improved methods .",
    "useful modifications of our procedures might include changing the @xmath81 relation in the high photosphere .",
    "this has already been shown to give fits to the balmer lines ( kochukhov , bagnulo , & barklem 2002 ) , and can give nibs on the k - line ( cowley , hubrig , & kamp 2006 ) . in the last reference , it was also pointed out that sharp k - line nibs could result if the gas pressure in the upper atmosphere were lowered .",
    "calculations done in lte must be considered provisional until supported by work done with non - lte .",
    "this is especially true for the upper atmospheres , where the total radiative flux is very nearly constant , independent of local conditions .",
    "the core of the ca k - line is formed highest of lines considered in this work , and cowley , hubrig & kamp showed that lte calculations were only slightly modified by non - lte .",
    "the greatest challenge of the observations of strong - line profiles of cp stars is to the theoretician .",
    "it is straightforward to make ad hoc adjustments to a model until a profile is fit .",
    "it is quite another to justify such modifications with rigorous calculations .",

    "calculations near series limits need to account for overlapping lines , as well as the `` dissolution '' of some discrete upper levels by various perturbations from the plasma bath of the emitting and absorbing atoms .",
    "we have implemented the scheme outlined in cowley ( 2000 ) in conjunction with a probability function @xmath83 for the existence of discrete upper levels .",
    "the specific routine was from barklem ( 2004 ) .",
    "the basic assumption is that we can calculate the total opacity due to both bound - bound and quasi - continuous absorption by considering only a wavelength region near a given bound - bound transition .",
    "these regions extend from the halfway points between transitions to level @xmath84 and @xmath85 , and from @xmath85 to @xmath86 .",
    "we shall refer to these regions as the _ n - local regions .",
    "_ following the reference cited , we define an @xmath85-dependent cross section , such that for a paschen line @xmath87 the integral here is assumed to extend _ only _ over the n - local region .",
    "the cross sections so defined are in excellent agreement with those found in topbase ( cunto , et al .",
    "1993 ) for photon energies below the ionization limit .",
    "line absorption in the n - local region is calculated in the usual way , but with the product @xmath88 diminished by the occupation probability @xmath83 . however , the line profile is truncated at each end of the n - local region .",
    "the ordinary continuous opacity is then augmented by an amount necessary to bring the total absorption into agreement with the above equation . in this way",
    "the total absorption merges smoothly with the known photoelectron absorption cross section at the series limit , as has been known for many years ( sugiura 1927 ) ."
