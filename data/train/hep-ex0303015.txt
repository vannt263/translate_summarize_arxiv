    "the beam delivery system ( bds ) of the jlc is @xmath0  km long and consists of four parts : switch - yard , collimator , final focus system ( ffs ) , and beam dump as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdslayout ] .",
    "the bds serves multiple purposes : ( i ) to switch beams from the main linac or the bypass line to the first or second interaction point ( ip ) , ( ii ) to create a finite crossing angle at the ip , ( iii ) to collimate the beams to eliminate possible backgrounds at the detector , ( iv ) to focus the beams at the ip , ( v ) to protect the machine from damages due to beam aborts , and ( vi ) to dump the spent beams after collision safely .",
    "the design of the jlc bds is based on that of nlc bds , because of the close similarity of the overall machine design and parameters .",
    "a notable difference , however , exists between jlc and nlc in a layout of the bds .",
    "it arises from the beam crossing angle at the first ip ; jlc has a small angle of 7  mrad while nlc has 20  mrad .",
    "figure  [ fig : bds_jlc ] shows the geomtry of a jlc bds .",
    "the aspect ratio in this diagram is highly distorted to illustrate the bending of the beam lines and the beam crossing angle at the ip .",
    "figure  [ fig : bdsoptics ] shows the optics functions in the collimator and final focus sections . in the following we assume the electron beam energy of 250  gev .",
    "a full simulation program , lcbds  @xcite , has been developed to simulate the entire bds .",
    "the lcbds uses geant4  @xcite to model the individual beamline elements including drifts , all ( dipole , quadrupole , sextupole , octapole , and decapole ) magnets , collimator elements ( spoiler , absorber , and energy slit ) , and a beampipe .",
    "physics processes currently included in the code are multiple scattering at the beamline elements , electromagnetic shower and photon conversion to muon pairs . in order to gain reasonable statistics ,",
    "we increase the muon production cross section by a factor of 100 to generate events and , then , scale down the results by the same factor . in order to verify the tracking capability of the simulation ,",
    "the transportation of the core beam has been simulated from the entrance of the bds to the ip and the results are compared with the beam profile shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdsoptics ] obtained by using sad program  @xcite .",
    "the core beam is assumed to have a size of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and an angular dispersion of @xmath3 and @xmath4 at the entrance of the bds .",
    "figure  [ fig : size ] shows the beam size at the ip obtained by the lcbds .",
    "the results ( 214.5 nm and 2.73 nm in @xmath5 and @xmath6 directions , respectively , in rms ) well reproduce the design values ( 211  nm and 2.7  nm ) .",
    "the sources of the background can be categorized as follows :    1 .",
    "upstream background : background produced upstream of the ip .",
    "this includes synchrotron radiation generated at the final focus quadrupole and bending magnets , and muons produced in electromagnetic showers arising from lost halo electrons / positrons . because the collimators are designed to scrape off halo particles , muons are produced predominantly at the collimators .",
    "ip background : background generated at the ip . produced via @xmath7 collisions at the ip are disrupted primary beams , beamstrahlung photons , @xmath7 pairs from beam - beam interactions , radiative bhabhas and hadrons from two - photon interactions .",
    "downstream background : background produced downstream of the ip .",
    "this concerns secondary neutrons produced at the extraction line and beam dump . a large number of low - energy neutrons can drift back and back - shine the detector .",
    "we report on - going efforts to identify background sources based on the lcbds simulation .",
    "synchrotron radiation photons reached at the ip are predominantly generated at the final quadrupole magnets .",
    "photons generated at the bending magnets upstream of the final quadrupole magnets also reach at the ip .",
    "figure  [ fig : sor_space ]  ( a ) shows the spatial distribution of the synchrotron radiation photons arising from a nominal beam ( core beam ) containing @xmath8 electrons . the extent of @xmath6 distribution is limited within @xmath9  mm . the @xmath5 distribution , however , is wider and has a long tail extending to @xmath10  cm .",
    "this is due to photons generated at the bending magnets .",
    "these photons are mostly contained within the beampipe ( nominally with a radius of 2  cm ) even without any mask and therefore , will not be serious background to the detector .",
    "the energy distribution of the photons is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sor_energy ]  ( a ) .",
    "the mean photon energy is @xmath11  mev .",
    "synchrotron radiation photons originating from the beam halo , electrons with large amplitudes , can be more spread and could become serious background . in the current design the collimator section removes halo particles with amplitudes larger than @xmath12 or @xmath13 from the beam center .",
    "the size and material of spoilers and absorbers used in our simulations are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdscomp ] .    in order to simulate the collimator section performance and the remaining synchrotron radiation , we generate the beam halo electrons that distribute uniformly over @xmath14 and @xmath15 region , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the nominal beam size at the entrance of the bds .",
    "the angular distribution of the halo is also uniform over @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the spatial and energy distributions of the resulting photons ( without any mask near the ip ) are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : sor_space ]  ( b ) and [ fig : sor_energy ]  ( b ) .",
    "these photons are still contained in the beampipe and will further be reduced by a mask system .      the collimator section in turn can become a source of the background .",
    "muon pairs can be produced via photon conversions in the electromagnetic showers created by the lost halo electrons .",
    "figure  [ fig : muonip ] shows the energy and spatial distributions of the muons reached at the ip if the bds is not equipped with any muon shield .",
    "the average muon energy is @xmath20  gev .",
    "the probability for a 250  gev electron lost at the collimator to produce a muon at the ip ( without muon shield ) is estimated to be @xmath21 .",
    "figure  [ fig : muonvertex ] shows where along the bds those muons are produced .",
    "they are produced predominantly at the collimator section .",
    "the magnetized iron pipes surrounding the beam pipe have been considered as an option of the muon shield .",
    "its design and detailed simulation are under study .",
    "we have presented some of the early results obtained using a beam delivery system simulation based on geant4 . this program , lcbds , has successfully reproduced the beam profile as designed .",
    "we have shown the results on the synchrotron radiation and muons produced in the jlc beam delivery system .",
