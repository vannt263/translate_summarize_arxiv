    "<S> since the dielectric tensor matrix elements involved in the optical interband transitions are of the form @xmath58 with @xmath59 being an odd parity operator , clearly , transitions between states of the same parity will be strongly suppressed whereas transitions between states of different parity will dominate . </S>",

    "<S> even though a spiral order has been suggested from experiment  @xcite , we have considered , for simplicity , a zigzag magnetic order as in na@xmath0iro@xmath1 for the calculations .    </S>",

    "<S> this strong mixing of character , which remains in the magnetic calculations , explains why the b peak in li@xmath0iro@xmath1 is much stronger than in na@xmath0iro@xmath1 ; the suppressed odd to odd transition in na@xmath0iro@xmath1 evolves into a mixture of enhanced and suppressed transitions in li@xmath0iro@xmath1 .    </S>",

    "<S> nevertheless , we have shown that the main features observed in optical conductivity are related to the underlying symmetries of the molecular orbital basis , which is a manifestation of the fact that spin - orbit coupling is not the only determining interaction in these materials .    in summary </S>",

    "<S> magnetism and a nonzero @xmath61 were necessary in order to reproduce the experimental insulating gap in both systems . </S>",
    "<S> using the fact that the narrow bands of na@xmath0iro@xmath1 are well described in terms of quasi - molecular orbitals , we showed that the strength of the various interband contributions to the optical conductivity can be well described in terms of the parity of the quasi - molecular orbitals , namely weight suppression in like - parity transitions and weight enhancement in unlike - parity transitions . </S>",
    "<S> we also predict the shape of the optical conductivity for li@xmath0iro@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to na@xmath0iro@xmath1 , in li@xmath0iro@xmath1 the quasi - molecular orbitals strongly overlap and parities mix . </S>",
