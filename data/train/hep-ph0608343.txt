    "one of the reasons why rare k decays are interesting is the good theoretical control reached over their predictions in the sm . in this section",
    ", the ingredients needed are shortly reviewed .",
    "the electroweak processes driving the rare semi - leptonic k decays are the @xmath3 box , @xmath4 and @xmath5 penguins@xcite , and lead to the amplitude @xmath6 with @xmath7 , @xmath8 . without the dependence of the loop functions @xmath9 on the quark masses ,",
    "ckm unitarity would imply vanishing fcnc ( gim mechanism ) .",
    "now , looking at these dependences , combined with the scaling of the ckm elements , one can readily get a handle on the importance of each quark contribution .    for @xmath10 ,",
    "only the @xmath4 penguin and @xmath3 box enter , @xmath11 , and light quark contributions are suppressed . since , in addition , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , indirect cp - violation is small . for @xmath14 ,",
    "the @xmath15 and @xmath16 parts contribute .    for @xmath17 , the photon penguin enters with its scaling @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "direct cp - violation is still short - distance dominated thanks to @xmath20 , but not indirect cp - violation , completely dominated by the long - distance @xmath21-quark photon penguin , @xmath22 .    for @xmath23 ,",
    "the structure is similar to @xmath0 , up to the change @xmath24 ( no single - photon penguin ) .",
    "finally , for charged leptons , there is also the double - photon penguin , which gives a cp - conserving contribution ( @xmath25 ) to @xmath1 and @xmath23 , and is completely dominated by long - distance ( @xmath21-quark ) .",
    "having identified the relevant electroweak structures , both perturbative and non - perturbative qcd effects have now to be included .",
    "this is done in three main steps :    _ step 1 _ : integration of heavy degrees of freedom ( top , w , z ) , including perturbative qcd effects above @xmath26 .",
    "this generates local fcnc operators , and fermi - type four fermion local operators .",
    "_ step 2 _ : resummation of qcd corrections ( running down ) . at the @xmath27 threshold ( similar for @xmath28 ) , four - fermion operators are combined to form closed @xmath27 loops , which are then replaced by a tower of effective interactions in increasing powers of ( external momentum)/(charm mass ) .",
    "the lowest order consists again of the dim.6 fcnc operators , while dim.8 operators are corrections scaling naively like @xmath29 .",
    "_ step 3 _ : to get the amplitude , it remains to compute the matrix elements of all the operators obtained .",
    "those of dim.6 semi - leptonic operators can be extracted from @xmath30 decays ( with chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) corrections ) .",
    "contributions from four - quark operators are represented directly in terms of meson fields in chpt , such that non - local @xmath21-quark loops are represented as meson loops .",
    "the price to pay are some unknown low - energy constants , to be extracted from experiment . for dim.8 operators ,",
    "an approximate matching is done with the chpt representation of the @xmath21-quark contributions .",
    "a high level of precision is attained for these modes .",
    "dim.6 fcnc operators from the @xmath31-quark are known at nlo , while @xmath27-quark ones have recently been obtained at nnlo@xcite .",
    "the matrix elements for these operators are known from @xmath32 , including the leading isospin corrections @xcite . for @xmath33 ,",
    "residual @xmath27-quark effects from dim.8 operators , along with long - distance @xmath21-quark effects have also been computed@xcite . for @xmath34 , icpv is of about 1%@xcite while the cp - conserving contribution is less than 0.01%@xcite .",
    "the sm predictions are @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the error on @xmath34 is dominated by @xmath37 , while for @xmath38 , which receives a significant @xmath27-quark contribution , it breaks down to@xcite scales ( 13% ) , @xmath39(22% ) , ckm , @xmath40 , @xmath41 ( 37% ) and matrix - elements from @xmath32 and light - quark contributions ( 28% ) .",
    "further improvements are thus possible through a better knowledge of @xmath39 , of the isospin breaking in the @xmath42 form - factors , or by a lattice study of higher - dimensional operators .      here",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "the @xmath31 and @xmath27 quark contributions , known to nlo , generate both the dimension - six vector @xmath43 and axial - vector @xmath44 operators .",
    "the former produces the @xmath45 pair in a @xmath46 state , the latter in both @xmath47 and @xmath48 states .",
    "indirect cp - violation is related to @xmath49 , dominated by the chpt counterterm @xmath50@xcite .",
    "na48 measurements give @xmath51@xcite .",
    "producing @xmath45 in a @xmath46 state , it interferes with the contribution from the @xmath52 operator , arguably constructively@xcite .",
    "the cp - conserving contribution from @xmath53 proceeds through two - photons , i.e. produces the lepton pair in either a helicity - suppressed 0@xmath54 or phase - space suppressed @xmath55 state .",
    "the lo corresponds to the finite two - loop process @xmath56 , @xmath57 , exactly predicted by chpt , and produces only 0@xmath54 states .",
    "higher order corrections are estimated using experimental data on @xmath58 for both the @xmath59 and @xmath55 contributions@xcite .    altogether , the predicted rates are @xmath60 and @xmath61 for constructive ( destructive ) interference .",
    "the errors are detailed in @xcite .",
    "overall , the error on @xmath50 is currently the most limitative and better measurements of @xmath49 would be welcomed .",
    "finally , the integrated forward - backward ( or lepton - energy ) asymmetry ( see refs in @xcite ) is generated by the interference between cp - conserving and cp - violating amplitudes . while for @xmath62 , no reliable prediction can be made because of the poor theoretical control on the @xmath55 contribution , the situation is better for @xmath63 , for which the @xmath59 contribution is under control . though the error is large , it can be used to fix the interference sign since @xmath64 or @xmath65 depending on sign@xmath66 .",
    "the short - distance ( sd ) piece from @xmath31 and @xmath27-quarks is known to nlo and nnlo@xcite , resp . , and is helicity - suppressed .",
    "indirect cp - violation is negligible .",
    "the long - distance ( ld ) contribution , from the matrix elements of @xmath53 , proceeds again through two - photons .",
    "still , there are three differences with respect to @xmath67 .",
    "first , the contribution from the imaginary part of the photon loop , estimated from @xmath68 , is much larger than sd , and already accounts for the bulk of the experimental @xmath2 rate .",
    "second , while the charged meson loop in @xmath69 is acting like a cut - off , and a finite result is found , now the two photons arise from the axial anomaly , and @xmath70 is divergent .",
    "though still with a large theoretical error , the dispersive @xmath71 part was estimated using experimental information on @xmath72 and the perturbative behavior of the @xmath73 loop@xcite . finally , both sd and ld produce the lepton pair in the same 0@xmath74 state and interfere with an unknown sign , which depends on that of @xmath75 . in this respect ,",
    "the progress made in @xcite for treating @xmath68 points towards constructive interference between sd and ld .",
    "as shown there , confirmation of this sign could be obtained from better measurements of @xmath76 or @xmath77 .",
    "being suppressed in the standard model , and in addition , the sm predictions being under theoretical control , makes the rare @xmath78 decays ideal to get clear signals of new physics ( np ) .",
    "even if lhc finds np signals before kaon experiments , it will remain essential to probe the @xmath79 sector . indeed , in general ,",
    "np models involve many new flavor breaking parameters .",
    "experimental information will be necessary to establish their structure , and thereby , give us some hints about a possible higher level of unification .",
    "model - independently , the present measurement of @xmath80 limits the possible effects in @xmath81 , as expressed by the grossman - nir bound@xcite , @xmath82 , corresponding to @xmath83 ( 90% ) , about 50 times the sm prediction .",
    "many models have been considered along the years , like for example the enhanced ew penguins@xcite , little higgs@xcite , extra dimensions@xcite , ... which are encoded into @xmath84 fcnc operators , or leptoquark interactions@xcite , r - parity violating susy@xcite , ... which can give rise also to new scalar / tensor fcnc interactions .",
    "we will here concentrate on the mssm .    * * mssm at large tan**@xmath85 * : * when @xmath86 say , the higgs couplings to quarks get significant higher - order loop effects . of interest for @xmath0",
    "is the charged higgs contribution to the @xmath4 penguin@xcite , which exhibits a @xmath87 behavior , is sensitive to @xmath88 and is slowly decoupling when @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath90{c}\\text{\\includegraphics[width=65mm]{fignp1.eps }   } \\\\",
    "\\text{\\includegraphics[width=72mm]{fignp2.eps }   } \\end{array } $ ]    * * mssm at moderate tan**@xmath85 * : * in this case , the chargino penguins are dominant@xcite . also , the single mass insertion approximation is not sufficient , and these contributions probe the double @xmath91 insertion .",
    "many works have analysed the phenomenological consequences of these effects .",
    "let us concentrate on two questions of relevance for future experiments .",
    "first , how large the effect on @xmath92 can be , given the current measurement of @xmath93 .",
    "this has been answered in @xcite , which showed that the gn bound can still be saturated in the mssm .",
    "a full scan over the parameters was performed , using adaptive numerical algorithms ( fig.[fignp1 ] , top ) .",
    "a second question , especially relevant after a susy discovery at lhc , is how does the constraint from @xmath0 on the trilinear terms @xmath94 compare with those from other k and b physics observables .",
    "this has been answered in @xcite .",
    "fig.[fignp1 ] ( bottom ) shows that the @xmath0 decays are the most sensitive probe of that sector .    *",
    "minimal flavor violation : * if the sm yukawas remain the only source of flavor - symmetry breaking also beyond the sm , the fcnc remain tuned essentially by the ckm matrix , hence are suppressed@xcite . this hypothesis can be enforced model - independently , or , e.g. , within the mssm . in this latter case , since the @xmath31-quark yukawa is large , sizeable trilinear @xmath94 terms are still allowed . as said previously , the @xmath0 modes are very sensitive to that sector .    still , mfv does its job perfectly in killing any large deviation with respect to the sm . though the mfv analyses in the literature differ in their parametrization , statistical treatment of errors , extraction of ckm elements and in the resulting correlations among observables , they all agree that the enhancement of @xmath0 never exceeds 25%@xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 pair of decays is interesting at least for three reasons .",
    "first , compared to @xmath0 , they can probe helicity - suppressed operators .",
    "second , compared to @xmath95 , the theoretical control on the sm part is better and further , @xmath2 is not sensitive to tensor operators",
    ". finally , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are two modes with very similar dynamics , but for the very different lepton masses .",
    "this makes them ideal to probe np effects through their signatures in the pair@xcite .     against @xmath98 for various np scenarios@xcite.,width=245 ]    * vector and axial - vector operators : * the @xmath99 operators , already present in the sm , arise for example from eewp@xcite , mssm , ... in general , these models also affect @xmath0 , and the sensitivity is slightly lower for @xmath1 than for @xmath34 . anyway , they should not be disregarded because , contrary to the neutrinos , they offer the possibility to disentangle np effects in @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "indeed , @xmath102 produces the final lepton pair also in a helicity - suppressed @xmath48 state , hence contributes differently to @xmath96 and @xmath97 , while the @xmath103 contribution is identical ( up to phase - space corrections ) .",
    "this is depicted by the red region in fig.[fignp2 ] , which corresponds to the region in the @xmath104 plane spanned leaving @xmath102 and @xmath100 operator coefficients arbitrary ( but keeping lepton universality ) . taking all the errors into account , this translates into the bounds @xmath105 with @xmath106 .    finally , the contribution from emo operator @xmath107 can always be absorbed into a redefinition of @xmath100@xcite , and thus possible np contributions to it can not be disentangled .",
    "* scalar and pseudoscalar operators * , @xmath108 , induce a cp - conserving ( cp - violating ) contribution , respectively . when these operators are helicity - suppressed , only the muon mode is significantly affected .",
    "such a situation corresponds for example to the mssm at large @xmath109 , where they arise from neutral higgs penguins and are sensitive to down - squark mass insertions@xcite .",
    "combined with general @xmath110 operators , the blue regions in fig.[fignp2 ] can be spanned .",
    "specific models like the mssm can generate both @xmath111 and @xmath112 operators , contributing to @xmath23 . working out their relation , the current @xmath113 corresponds to the yellow region in fig.[fignp2 ] .",
    "if the ( pseudo-)scalar operators are helicity - allowed , the electron mode becomes more sensitive , simply because of the phase - space suppression .",
    "such types of operators can arise from leptoquark tree - level exchanges@xcite or sneutrino exchanges in susy without @xmath114-parity@xcite .",
    "still , operators contributing to @xmath115 will also be generated .",
    "such contributions to an otherwise helicity - suppressed mode are very constrained by @xmath116 , and should not lead to a perceptible impact in fig.[fignp2 ] .    * tensor and pseudotensor operators * , * * @xmath117 and @xmath118 induce a cp - violating ( cp - conserving ) contribution , respectively . * * in case these operators are helicity - suppressed , being in addition phase - space suppressed , their impact on @xmath97 is smaller than for scalar and pseudoscalar operators .",
    "in addition , in models like the mssm , they are further suppressed by loop factors@xcite and their impact can be expected to be small .    on the other hand , if helicity - allowed , there are at present no constraint on them , since they do not contribute to @xmath23 .",
    "this is depicted by the green region in fig.[fignp2 ] .",
    "rare k decays are very clean and sensitive probes of new physics .",
    "they are promising not only to eventually get clear signals , but also to constrain the nature of the new physics at play through the pattern of deviations they could exhibit with respect to the sm predictions .",
