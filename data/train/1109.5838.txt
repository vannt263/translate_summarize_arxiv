    "a nearly scale invariant primordial scalar power spectrum , along with the assumption of the concordant , background cosmological model ( i.e. the spatially flat , @xmath1cdm model ) , seems to be in remarkable agreement with the data from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) of the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) ( for the most recent observations , see refs .",
    "@xcite ; for earlier results , see refs .",
    "@xcite ; for constraints on different inflationary scenarios , see refs .",
    "but , specific features in the primordial spectrum seem to improve the fit to the data to a reasonable extent ( for an inherently incomplete list , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , although the statistical relevance of such results remains difficult to assess .",
    "notably , while a sharp drop in power on scales corresponding to the hubble scale today has been found to fit the low cmb quadrupole better  @xcite , a burst of oscillations of a suitable amplitude and over a certain range of scales seem to provide a considerably improved fit to the outliers in the cmb angular power spectrum near the multipoles of @xmath2 and @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "moreover , interestingly , oscillating inflaton potentials that generate small modulations over a wide range of scales in the perturbation spectrum have also been found to perform better against the data than the more conventional power law spectrum  @xcite .",
    "as is well known , a featureless , scale invariant perturbation spectrum can be produced by a suitably long epoch of slow roll inflation ( see any of the following texts  @xcite or reviews  @xcite ) .",
    "however , generating features in the scalar power spectrum require one or more periods of deviation from slow roll inflation  @xcite .",
    "for instance , it is found that one needs a large deviation from slow roll in order to produce a sharp drop in power , say , so as to fit the low quadrupole  @xcite .",
    "the larger the deviation from slow roll , the sharper the drop is found to be and , in fact , a brief departure from inflation  which leads to a sharp rise in power _ and _ a couple of oscillations before the spectrum turns nearly scale invariant  has been found to provide a good fit to the data at the lower multipoles  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a small and short burst of deviation from slow roll seems sufficient to generate the oscillations that result in a much better fit to the outliers near the multipoles of @xmath2 and @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "while certain features indeed lead to a better fit to the data than the standard power law primordial spectrum , the improvement in the fit is often arrived at with the introduction of extra parameters . as we pointed out above ,",
    "the statistical significance of features achieved at the cost of additional parameters , say , from the bayesian point of view  @xcite , remains to be investigated satisfactorily .    during the last few years",
    ", a variety of approaches have been developed to determine the extent of non - gaussianities in the wmap data ( for an inexhaustive list , see refs .",
    "@xcite ; in this context , also see the recent reviews  @xcite ) .",
    "many of these analyses seem to indicate that the cmb may possibly possess reasonably large amount of non - gaussianities .",
    "for instance ,",
    "the wmap seven year data constrains the parameter @xmath0 that is often introduced to characterize the extent of the non - gaussianity to be @xmath4 in the local limit , at @xmath5 confidence level ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ; also see the reviews  @xcite ) .",
    "while a gaussian primordial spectrum ( which corresponds to a vanishing  @xmath0 ) lies within @xmath6-@xmath7 , evidently , the mean value seems to indicate a rather large amount of non - gaussianity .",
    "the ongoing planck mission  @xcite is expected to reduce the above - mentioned uncertainty in the wmap s determination of @xmath0 by a factor of about four or so . on the theoretical side ,",
    "it has been realized that , if planck indeed detects a reasonable amount of non - gaussianity , then it can act as a powerful tool to substantially constrain the plethora of inflationary models that seem to be allowed by the currently available data  @xcite .",
    "for example , it has been established that the canonical scalar field models which lead to a nearly scale invariant primordial spectrum contain only a negligible amount of non - gaussianity , with the magnitude of @xmath0 turning out to be much smaller than unity  @xcite .",
    "hence , these models will cease to be viable if non - gaussianity turns out to be substantial .",
    "however , it is known that primordial spectra with features , generated due to one or more deviations from slow roll inflation , can lead to reasonably large non - gaussianities  @xcite .",
    "( it should be mentioned that , initial states other than the bunch - davies vacuum can also lead to features and , possibly , relatively substantial non - gaussianities  @xcite .",
    "but , we shall not consider such situations in this paper . ) therefore , if non - gaussianity indeed proves to be large , then , either one has to reconcile with the fact that the primordial spectrum contains features or one has to pay more attention to non - canonical scalar field models such as , say , the d - brane inflation models  @xcite .",
    "often , the efforts in evaluating the non - gaussianities when features arise in the primordial spectrum due to a departure from slow roll have involved numerical computations  @xcite , and it is instructive to consider a model wherein it may be possible to evaluate them analytically . in this work , we shall consider the starobinsky model  @xcite , which involves the canonical scalar field and consists of a linear inflaton potential with an abrupt change in the slope at a given point .",
    "the change in the slope causes a brief period of fast roll , which leads to a sharp rise in power and oscillations in the scalar spectrum for modes that leave the hubble radius just before and during the period of fast roll .",
    "the important aspect of the starobinsky model is that the scalar power spectrum can be evaluated analytically and , under certain conditions on the parameters , the analytic spectrum matches the exact spectrum , computed numerically , extremely well",
    ". we shall focus on the equilateral limit and illustrate that , remarkably , under the same conditions , all the contributions to the scalar bi - spectrum too can be calculated completely analytically and expressed entirely in terms of the three parameters that describe the starobinsky model .",
    "we shall also discuss the ranges of the parameters over which the non - gaussianity in the model can be large .    at this point , we ought to mention that non - gaussianities in the starobinsky model have , in fact , been computed earlier  @xcite .",
    "but , since the formalism followed in the earlier work is rather different from the approach that we shall adopt , carrying out an exact comparison between the two efforts turns out to be difficult .",
    "while the non - gaussianity parameter in the equilateral limit obtained in both the approaches lead to a sharp peak near the characteristic scale associated with the problem , we find the approach we have adopted here is able to capture the finer details as well .",
    "we believed that this can attributed to the @xmath8 formalism adopted in the earlier work , which is essentially applicable on super hubble scales . despite the additional efforts that were made to take into account the contributions due to the decaying mode  which become important when deviations from slow roll occur ( in this context , see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite)we find that the approach still proves to be insufficient to arrive at the exact form for the final result .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the following section",
    ", we shall outline the essential aspects of the starobinsky model .",
    "we shall first describe the background evolution in the model , and then go on to discuss the scalar power spectrum that arises in the model .",

    "[ sec : so ] with a brief summary and outlook .",

    "this , in turn , implies that inflation does not end even though the slow roll approximation breaks down temporarily with the higher order slow roll parameters becoming large ( see discussion below ) .",

    "careful analysis points to the fact that , in order to achieve this relation at late times , one needs to actually take into account the property that , strictly , the hubble parameter is not a constant .",

    "in contrast , one finds that the step in the power spectrum and the bi - spectrum reverse direction when @xmath565 , with the lower level of the step being located at large wavenumbers .",

    "while the tilt ensures a good fit to the data at the higher multipoles , a sharp cut - off can improve the fit to the outliers at the lower multipoles that we had discussed in some detail in the introductory section .",
    "one finds that , in the presence of a suitable spectral tilt , the best fit value of @xmath566 proves to be about @xmath573 ( see the fourth reference in refs .",
    "@xcite ; also , according to the article , the best fit value for @xmath163 is @xmath574 ) and , therefore , the domain @xmath575 is favored by the data .",
    "this implies that @xmath576 is about @xmath577 from the mean value , whereas @xmath578 is further away , being at @xmath579 , from the mean value .",
    "clearly , had these results been obtained for the exact case of the starobinsky model ( i.e. in the absence of the overall tilt that has been introduced by hand ) , low values of @xmath566 , such as @xmath578 , would be ruled out . in summary , as is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : fnl ] , the starobinsky model can result in a power spectrum that remains reasonably consistent with the data while at the same time lead to an @xmath0 that is as large as a few , at most @xmath580 .",
    "indeed , it would be interesting to strengthen such a conclusion by carrying out an explicit comparison of the power spectrum in the starobinsky model with the data and also studying the exact implications of an oscillatory , scale dependent , @xmath0 for the non - gaussianities in the cmb .    though the starobinsky model , with parameters that are consistent with the data , in itself , may not lead to a large @xmath0 , we believe that the starobinsky model with a much smaller @xmath566 , and hence a rather large @xmath0 can be considered to effectively capture certain aspects of other models that are known to lead to a better fit to the data than the conventional , power law , primordial spectrum .",

    "however , the step turns out to be sharper ( than in the case of the best fit value of @xmath581 ) , and the oscillations at the higher level of the step , before the spectrum turns scale invariant , are fewer .",
    "the starobinsky model with a much smaller  @xmath566 can broadly be considered to mimic the sharper step that arises in punctuated inflation .",
    "therefore , if one naively extends the results of the starobinsky model to punctuated inflation , it suggests that there can exist scenarios which lead to a sharp step in the power spectrum ( along with certain characteristic oscillations ) , an improved fit to the data as well as a reasonably large @xmath0 .",
    "as we have argued before , prior experience suggests that , when departures from the slow roll arise , it is the fourth term in the interaction hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hint ] ) that leads to the most significant contribution to the bi - spectrum .",
    "however , such a conclusion has largely been based on numerical analysis , which typically involves working with specific values ( or , at the most , a limited range of values ) for the parameters of the model concerned . since we have been able to arrive at analytic expressions for all the different contributions to the bi - spectrum for the starobinsky model ,",
    "it is interesting to investigate whether such a conclusion indeed applies for a wide range of the parameters of the model or if there exist certain values of the parameters for which other terms can possibly contribute as much as or even more than the fourth term .",
    "let us quickly recall some essential properties of the various contributions to the bi - spectrum , arising out of the interaction hamiltonian and the field redefinition . while the contributions due to the first , the second and the third terms in the interaction hamiltonian involve @xmath582 , the fourth term contains @xmath264 , whereas the fifth and the sixth terms depend on  @xmath583 [ cf .",
    "( [ eq : cg1])([eq : cg6 ] ) ] . also , note that , apart from the difference in the dependence on the slow roll parameter  @xmath41 , the first , the third , the fifth and the sixth terms depend on the curvature perturbation and its derivative in the same fashion , viz .",
    "they depend linearly on the curvature perturbation and quadratically on its derivative .",
    "in contrast , the second term does not depend on the derivative of the curvature perturbation at all , while the fourth term depends linearly on the derivative and quadratically on the curvature perturbation itself .",
    "further , the additional seventh term arising due to the field redefinition depends on the late time behavior of @xmath43 and the fourth power of the curvature perturbation . in a slow roll inflationary scenario",
    ", one can anticipate that the first , the second , the third and the seventh terms lead to contributions of similar magnitudes to the bi - spectrum , while the contributions due to the fourth , the fifth and the sixth terms can be expected to be suitably suppressed in amplitude due to the presence of the additional slow roll parameter .",
    "in fact , these expectations are broadly corroborated by the results obtained  @xcite .    when there arise deviations from slow roll , as we have repeatedly mentioned , it is the fourth term that is expected to dominate , with the first , the second , the third and the seventh terms proving to be of roughly similar order , but smaller in amplitude than the fourth term .",
    "the contributions of the fifth and the sixth terms can be expected to be further smaller in amplitude .",
    "these expectations are confirmed by fig .",
    "[ fig : gall ] , wherein we have plotted the absolute values of all the contributions to the bi - spectrum in the equilateral limit that we have focused on .     times the absolute values of @xmath584 ( in light green ) , @xmath351 ( in red ) , @xmath330 ( in blue ) , @xmath585 ( in purple ) and @xmath271 ( in dark green)that we had plotted in the earlier figures ( i.e. in figs .",

    "the hierarchy of the various contributions to the bi - spectrum is evident from the figure.,width=566 ]    it is worth pointing out here that the slightly higher amplitude of the second term in contrast to the contributions due to the first and the third terms can be attributed to the fact that the second term does not involve any derivative of the curvature perturbation .",
    "we shall return to this point a little later in our discussion .",
    "since the hierarchy of the different contributions changes as one moves from the slow roll to a fast roll regime , it is interesting to identify the domain where the hierarchy shifts in the starobinsky model .",
    "recall that , a crucial assumption of the starobinsky model is that it is the constant  @xmath72 in the potential which is dominant near the discontinuity .",
    "once this condition is satisfied , the departures from slow roll can essentially be described in terms of the ratio @xmath566 . upon plotting the various contributions for different @xmath566",
    ", we find that , deviations from the slow roll hierarchy begin to occur even for an @xmath586 as small as  @xmath587 .    , which essentially reflects the amplitude of the contribution due to the second term @xmath351 in contrast to the fourth term @xmath330 , has been plotted as a function of @xmath162 for a few different values of the ratio @xmath570 .",
    "we should stress again that @xmath588 depends only on @xmath566 and @xmath162 .",

    "the upward spikes correspond to the wavenumbers at which @xmath330 vanishes , so that the contribution due to @xmath351 turns dominant .",
    "even apart from these specific locations , it is evident that @xmath588 can be as large as @xmath589 in a domain which admits fast roll .",
    "since @xmath417 can be possibly as large as @xmath267 with the assumptions and approximations of the starobinsky model continuing to remain valid , this indicates that @xmath351 can be of the order of @xmath330 in a fast roll regime.,width=566 ]    with the analytic results that we have at hand , it is also worthwhile to investigate whether the fourth term remains the dominant term for all values of the parameters of the starobinsky model when deviations from slow roll occur or if there exist regimes where the hierarchy is mixed or even , possibly , absent .",
    "motivated by such an aim , let us enquire if , say , the second term @xmath351 can probably be as large as the fourth term @xmath330 for any set or a range of parameters of the starobinsky model .",
    "let us consider , for instance , the ratio @xmath590 where @xmath591 and @xmath561 are the contributions to the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath0 due to the terms @xmath351 and @xmath330 in the equilateral limit . as we have discussed , the first slow roll parameter before the transition , viz .",
    "@xmath417 , is expected to be small . in plotting the earlier figures , we have worked with parameters such that @xmath592 ( cf .",

    "interestingly , we find that the quantity @xmath588 can be expressed completely in terms of @xmath566 and , as in the case of all the other perturbed quantities , its dependence on the wavenumber arises only through the ratio @xmath162 . in fig .  [",
    "fig : q ] , we have plotted the absolute value of the quantity @xmath588 as a function of @xmath162 for a few different values of the ratio  @xmath566 .",
    "it is clear from the figure that , there does exist ranges of parameters of the starobinsky model for which @xmath595 and , therefore , @xmath596 , in domains that could admit departures from slow roll ( i.e. when @xmath566 deviates sufficiently from unity ) . to our knowledge , this conclusion is new , since , in the literature , @xmath330 has always been considered to be the dominant term when deviations from slow roll occur .",
    "moreover , we believe that this is the first time that this phenomenon has been explicitly illustrated .",
    "this suggests that , it is plausible that the hierarchy is different in different regions of the parameter space of a model .",
    "however , a cautionary remark needs to be added to arriving at such a conclusion .",
    "recall that , in our evaluation of @xmath329 , we had neglected certain terms in the quantity @xmath597 [ see our remarks that immediately follow eq .",
    "( [ eq : fkp - at ] ) ] . as a result ,",
    "a concern could arise that , for the parameters discussed above , the neglected terms contribute sufficiently to restore the hierarchy wherein @xmath330 is the dominant term during fast roll .",
    "but , we have also analyzed the issue using a numerical code  @xcite and our preliminary results seem to confirm the above conclusion , viz . that the neglected terms are not significant enough to restore the commonly expected fast roll hierarchy .    .",

    "but , in order to converge on a viable set of parameters , a few points concerning certain aspects of the starobinsky model and the results that we have obtained requires some emphasis .",
    "in particular , as @xmath338 , we find that @xmath588 has the following simple form : @xmath600 in this limit , @xmath601 for small @xmath566 , while @xmath602 , when @xmath566 is large .",
    "these behavior are clearly reflected in fig .  [ fig : q ] .",
    "so , if we require @xmath588 to be large , we can either work with a high enough @xmath566 and focus on small wavenumbers , or choose an @xmath566 that is suitably smaller than unity which permits sufficient deviation from slow roll and also possibly leads to @xmath596 at large wavenumbers .",
    "however , recall that the regime @xmath575 seems to be favored by the cmb data . with these points in mind , let us now focus on arriving at a set of parameters in the @xmath603 domain which leads to @xmath595 . since , given a @xmath168 , @xmath31 is already determined by cobe normalization , choosing an @xmath417 fixes @xmath25 .",
    "we find that , if we work with the earlier values of @xmath168 and @xmath31 ( listed in the caption of fig .",
    "[ fig : potstaro ] ) , while set @xmath604 , corresponding to @xmath605 and @xmath599 , the hierarchy of the contributions is indeed different , with @xmath351 being of the same order as @xmath330 at large wavenumbers .",
    "this point is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : gall - h ] wherein we have plotted the various contributions @xmath606 for these values of the parameters . of course , such a low value of @xmath566 lies about @xmath607 away from the best fit value of @xmath581 that we had mentioned earlier .",
    "given that the starobinsky model in itself has not been directly constrained ( only certain variations around it have been tested precisely ) , this could indicate that the above choice of @xmath566 is possibly not completely ruled out by the data .",
    "however , in the case of the starobinsky model , it seems to us that , an altered hierarchy of the contributions to the bi - spectrum is systematically associated with regions of the parameter space that is not favored by the cmb data .",
    "if this is indeed true , this obviously tones down the importance of this modification to the hierarchy in the starobinsky model .",
    "but , as we had discussed in the previous sub - section , the starobinsky model with a smaller  @xmath566 may be considered to mimic other models that provide a good fit to the data .",
    "it is possible that one may encounter such altered hierarchies in these models .",
    "before we conclude , let us briefly touch upon the possible reasons for the variations to the hierarchy .",
    "we find that the understanding gained on the hierarchy of the different contributions to the bi - spectrum has been largely based on the behavior of the slow roll parameters .",
    "needless to mention , in addition to the slow roll parameters , the various contributions involve the curvature perturbation and its derivative as well . in a slow roll inflationary scenario ,",
    "the amplitude of the curvature perturbation evolves monotonically once it leaves the hubble radius .",
    "in particular , while the amplitude of the mode @xmath102 quickly goes to a constant value , its time derivative @xmath608 dies down as @xmath609 at super hubble scales .",
    "because of such a monotonic behavior of the curvature perturbation during slow roll , in such situations , the hierarchy is largely dependent on the slow parameters themselves",
    ". however , when departures from slow arise , it is known that the modes which leave the hubble radius just before or during the periods of deviations from slow roll can evolve strongly around the time of hubble exit .",
    "in fact , at super hubble scales , the amplitude of these modes can be enhanced or suppressed compared to their amplitudes at hubble exit ( in this context , see , for instance , refs .",
    "therefore , it is seems that , when departures from slow roll occur , the hierarchy can be different based on a mixture of the non - trivial evolution of the slow roll parameters and the curvature perturbation .",
    "we believe that this is an interesting aspect that demands further investigation .",
    "as we had discussed in some detail in the introductory section , models that lead to features in the primordial spectrum gain importance due to the fact that certain features can lead to a better fit to the cmb data than the conventional , nearly scale invariant scalar power spectrum , as is generated by slow roll inflation .",
    "the generation of features in the primordial spectrum requires one or more periods of of fast roll .",
    "while the scalar power spectrum and the bi - spectrum can be evaluated in a model independent fashion in the slow roll approximation , such a model independent approach seems difficult when departures from slow roll arise .",
    "this is essentially due to the fact that the deviations from slow roll can occur in a multitude of forms and it is impossible to describe all possible deviations in terms of a limited number of variables or parameters ( for a broader effort , that attempts to capture a certain class of departures from slow roll , see ref .",
    "in fact , in the literature , numerical computations are often resorted to in order to investigate scenarios involving fast roll .",
    "in such a situation , the starobinsky model provides a welcome relief as it allows the background as well as the scalar power spectrum to be evaluated analytically to a very good approximation , even though it contains departures from slow roll . in this work",
    ", we have shown that the scalar bi - spectrum can also be computed analytically .",
    "simultaneously , we have also been working towards numerically computing the scalar bi - spectrum and the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath0 in the starobinsky model .",
    "preliminary investigations indicate that the analytic expressions we have obtained match the numerical results quite well  @xcite , which reflect the extent of the accuracy of the assumptions and approximations of the starobinsky model .",
    "interestingly , we have found that , in the starobinsky model , for certain values of the parameters , the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath0 in the equilateral limit can be as large as indicated by the currently observed mean values , with the possible limitation that this occurs in a region of the parameter space that is not favored by the current cmb data .",
    "we had focused here on the equilateral limit and , clearly , it is imperative that we extend the analysis to other configurations such as , say , the squeezed limit  @xcite .",
    "further , there exist a few other models in the literature which allow the background and the perturbations to be evaluated analytically , and it is worthwhile to evaluate the bi - spectrum in these models too .",
    "we are currently investigating these issues .",
    "this appendix contains some additional information pertaining to the evaluation of certain non - trivial integrals we had encountered in the text .      in this sub - section",
    ", we shall provide a few details regarding the evaluation of the integrals @xmath430 and @xmath431 .",
    "let us start with the expression  ( [ eq : i13 ] ) for @xmath430 .",
    "as we had mentioned , the integral can be evaluated by writing  @xmath459 as a polynomial in the variable @xmath443 , and computing the integral term by term .",
    "if we write @xmath610 we find that the coefficients @xmath464 are given by @xmath611 where @xmath612 and @xmath613 if @xmath438 and @xmath614 if @xmath436 .",

    "if @xmath438 , then we find that @xmath619 , @xmath620 and @xmath621 . upon using the expression  ( [ eq : p1-e ] ) , @xmath430 can be written as @xmath622 which can be integrated to yield @xmath623,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath624 is the incomplete gamma function ( see , for example , ref .",

    "it is convenient to split the sum over @xmath626 into two parts as follows : @xmath631\\biggr\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have taken the limit @xmath396 . in terms of the exponential sum function @xmath465 and the exponential integral function @xmath445 ,",

    "<S> while a featureless , nearly scale invariant , primordial scalar power spectrum fits the most recent cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data rather well , certain features in the spectrum are known to lead to a better fit to the data ( although , the statistical significance of such results remains an open issue ) . in the inflationary scenario , </S>",
    "<S> one or more periods of deviations from slow roll are necessary in order to generate features in the scalar perturbation spectrum . over the last couple of years </S>",
    "<S> , it has been recognized that such deviations from slow roll inflation can also result in reasonably large non - gaussianities . </S>",
    "<S> the starobinsky model involves the canonical scalar field and consists of a linear inflaton potential with a sudden change in the slope . </S>",
    "<S> the change in the slope causes a brief period of departure from slow roll which , in turn , results in a sharp rise in power , along with a burst of oscillations in the scalar spectrum for modes that leave the hubble radius just before and during the period of fast roll . </S>",
    "<S> the hallmark of the starobinsky model is that it allows the scalar power spectrum to be evaluated analytically in terms of the three parameters that describe the model , viz . </S>",
    "<S> the two slopes that describe the potential on either side of the discontinuity and the hubble scale at the time when the field crosses the discontinuity . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the bi - spectrum of the scalar perturbations in the starobinsky model in the equilateral limit . remarkably , we find that , just as the power spectrum , all the different contributions to the the bi - spectrum too can be evaluated completely analytically and expressed in terms of the three paramaters that describe the model . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the quantity  @xmath0 , which characterizes the extent of non - gaussianity , can be expressed purely in terms of the ratio of the two slopes on either side of the discontinuity in the potential . </S>",
    "<S> further , we find that , for certain values of the parameters , @xmath0  in the starobinsky model can be as large as the mean value that has been arrived at from the analysis of the recent cmb data . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate that the usual hierarchy of contributions to the bi - spectrum can be altered for certain values of the parameters . </S>",
    "<S> altogether , we find that the starobinsky model represents a unique scenario wherein , even when the slow roll conditions are violated , the background , the perturbations as well as the corresponding two and three point correlation functions can be evaluated completely analytically . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> , the starobinsky model can also be used to calibrate numerical codes aimed at computing the non - gaussianities . </S>"
