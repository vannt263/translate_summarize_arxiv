    "examples [ x1tau1 ] and [ garside ] from the previous section show that the number of crossings may grow cubically or quadratically with word length .",

    "there is an elementary relation between the total number of crossings @xmath63 and @xmath76 , the maximal number of crossings of any pair of strands , which is given multiplying by the number of pairs , @xmath78 .",
