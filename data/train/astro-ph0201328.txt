    "the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) is a measurement of the sum of the light produced by all extragalactic sources over cosmic time .",
    "when it is integrated over the full spectral range , the so - called cosmic background is a fossil record of the overall activity of all galaxies from their birth until now .",
    "it can be considered as the global energetic budget available for any model aiming at simulating the birth and fate of galaxies during the hubble time .",
    "however the physical origin of this light will remain unknown until we have pinpointed the individual sources responsible for it .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to demonstrate that an important new result has come from the combination of a series of deep extragalactic surveys performed in the mid - infrared ( mir ) at 15@xmath0 m with the isocam camera ( cesarsky et al .",
    "1996a ) onboard the infrared space observatory ( iso , kessler et al .",
    "1996 ) : we suggest here that the galaxies detected in these surveys , which median redshift of @xmath13 was measured from a sub - sample of isocam galaxies , contribute dominantly to the cosmic infrared background ( cirb ) , i.e. the ebl integrated over all wavelengths within @xmath14= 5 to 1000@xmath0 m .",
    "the cirb was recently detected and measured thanks to the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) instruments firas ( far infrared absolute spectrometer ) and dirbe ( diffuse infrared background experiment ) ( puget et al .",
    "1996 , fixsen et al .",
    "1998 , lagache et al .",

    "1998 , finkbeiner et al .",
    "2000 ) from 100@xmath0 m to 1 mm .",
    "it peaks around @xmath15 140@xmath0 m and was found to represent at least half and maybe two thirds of the overall cosmic background ( see gispert , lagache & puget 2000 ) .",
    "hence the cirb reflects the bulk of the star formation that took place over the history of the universe . by resolving it into individual galaxies",
    ", we would therefore pinpoint the times and places where most stars seen in the local universe were formed .",
    "two physical processes were considered for its origin : nucleosynthesis , i.e. stellar radiation in star forming galaxies , and accretion around a black hole , i.e. active galactic nuclei . in both cases ,",
    "the light is not directly coming from its physical source but is reprocessed by dust , i.e. absorbed and re - radiated thermally by the `` warm '' dust .",
    "both processes are probably related ( see genzel et al .",
    "1998 ) , but energetic considerations , based on the presence of massive black holes and on the amount of heavy elements in local galaxies , suggest that star formation should by far dominate in the cirb over agn activity ( madau & pozzetti 2000 , franceschini et al .",
    "however , until the individual galaxies responsible for the cirb are found and studied in detail , this result will remain theoretical .    the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in the ir of local galaxies peaks above @xmath1060@xmath0 m and typically around 80 @xmath1 20@xmath0 m ( see sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "as a result , the distant galaxies responsible for the peak of the cirb detected by cobe around @xmath16 @xmath10 140@xmath0 m should be located below @xmath4 1.3 and present a redshift distribution peaked around @xmath4 0.8 , if their seds do not strongly differ from those of local galaxies .",
    "as we will see this is also the redshift range of the galaxies detected at 15@xmath0 m with isocam .",
    "the isocam extragalactic surveys were performed with two filters , lw2 ( 5 - 8.5@xmath0 m ) and lw3 ( 12 - 18@xmath0 m ) , centered at 6.75 and 15@xmath0 m respectively . the 6.75@xmath0 m sample of sources is strongly contaminated by galactic stars , whereas stars are rather easily distinguished from galaxies at 15@xmath0 m using optical - mir colour - colour plots . as a consequence , we are only concerned here by the 15@xmath0 m galaxies . moreover ,",
    "the observed 6.75@xmath0 m light is no more produced by dust emission for galaxies more distant than @xmath4 0.4 because of k - correction ( redshifted stellar light dominates the 6.75@xmath0 m band above this redshift ) , whereas the observed 15@xmath0 m light is mostly due to dust emission for galaxies up to @xmath4 2 .",
    "about 1000 galaxies detected in the 15@xmath0 m surveys were used to produce number counts ( i.e. surface density of galaxies as a function of flux density ; see elbaz et al .",
    "the steep slope of the 15@xmath0 m counts below @xmath17 mjy indicates the presence of an excess of faint sources by one order of magnitude in comparison with predictions assuming no evolution of the 15@xmath0 m luminosity function with redshift .",
    "the presence of broad emission features in the mir spectrum of galaxies alone can not explain the shape of the number counts and a strong evolution of either the whole luminosity function ( xu 2000 , chary & elbaz 2001 ) or preferentially of a sub - population of starburst galaxies evolving both in luminosity and density ( franceschini et al . 2001 , chary & elbaz 2001 , xu et al . 2001 ) is required in order to fit the isocam 15@xmath0 m counts . in the present paper , we suggest that these isocam galaxies are in fact dusty starbursts responsible for the bulk of the cirb .    in sect .",
    "[ resolve ] , we compare the sensitivity of different extragalactic surveys in several wavelength ranges to detect the galaxies responsible for the cirb . it is suggested that mir is presently the most efficient technique to detect dusty starbursts up to @xmath4 1.3 .    in sect .",

    "it represents a lower limit to the 15@xmath0 m ebl , which remains unknown .",
    "once the redshift distribution and sed of these galaxies is determined , it becomes possible to estimate their contribution to the cirb .    in sect .",
    "[ mirtracer ] , we demonstrate that mir luminosities at 6.75 , 12 and 15@xmath0 m are strongly correlated with the bolometric ir luminosity ( from 8 to 1000@xmath0 m ) for local galaxies .",

    "are obtained for the full sample of isocam galaxies used to produce these number counts , the redshift distribution of these galaxies can be inferred from a few sub - samples : hdfn ( aussel et al . 1999 , 2001 ) , cfrs-14 ( flores et al .",
    "1999 , 2002 ) , cfrs-03 ( flores et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the ultra - deep isocam survey of the hdfn samples a flux density range where most of the evolution observed in the number counts takes place and where the bulk of the 15@xmath0 m igl is produced .",

    "this redshift distribution is consistent with the twice larger sample of isocam galaxies detected in the cfrs fields cfrs-14 and cfrs-03 ( flores et al .",
    "1999 , 2002 ) .",
    "at the median redshift of @xmath87 0.8 , the observed 15 and 140@xmath0 m wavelengths correspond to about 7@xmath0 m ( isocam - lw2 filter ) and 80@xmath0 m ( iras bands ) in the rest - frame of the galaxies .",
    "luminosities at both wavelengths are correlated ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : correl]d ) .",
    "if the correlations between mir and fir luminosities remain valid up to @xmath4 1 , then they can be used to compute @xmath31 .",
    "we have checked with a sample of galaxies detected both in the mir with isocam and in the radio with the vla and wsrt , that the mir - fir and radio - fir correlations are consistent up to @xmath4 1 .",
    "this comparison independently validates our estimate of the bolometric ir luminosity of the isocam galaxies , although it is not clear whether the radio - fir correlation works also up to @xmath4 1 .",
    "the fraction of active nuclei responsible for the 15@xmath0 m luminosity of isocam galaxies was estimated from the deepest soft and hard x - ray surveys available at present by the xmm - newton and chandra x - ray observatories in the lockman hole and hdfn respectively ( fadda et al . 2001 ) .",
    "it was found that about ( 12@xmath15)@xmath5 of the isocam galaxies are powered by an agn and that the agn contribution to @xmath86 was about ( 17@xmath16)@xmath5 . the agn contribution to @xmath31",
    "was found to be as low as @xmath10 4@xmath5 assuming that they all share the sed of the local seyfert 2 , ngc 1068 .",
    "this is a conservative choice since ngc 1068 presents the flattest ir sed that we know .",
    "however , we note that the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) peaks around 30 kev ( see fig.1 of wilman , fabian & nulsen 2000 ) , while both xmm - newton and chandra were limited to energies below 10 kev .",
    "it is therefore possible that a population of hard x - ray agns was missed by these surveys .",
    "but as claimed by the authors of these deep x - ray surveys , the bulk of the cxb had been resolved into individual galaxies in the lockman hole and hdfn images . moreover , using estimates of the present comoving density of black holes , madau & pozzetti ( 2000 ) calculated that less than 20@xmath5 of the cirb could be due to dusty agns .    for the remaining star forming galaxies",
    ", we used a library of template seds , reproducing the mir - fir correlations , to compute their ir luminosity and contribution to @xmath31 .",
    "we find that ligs and uligs produce about 60@xmath5 of @xmath86 .",
    "the comoving density of ir luminosity produced by these luminous ir galaxies was about ( 70@xmath135 ) times larger at @xmath4 1 than today , while in the same redshift interval the @xmath88-band or uv luminosity densities only decreased by a factor @xmath10 3 .",
    "since the ir luminosity measures the dusty star formation rate of a galaxy , this also implies that the comoving density of star formation , due to luminous ir galaxies , decreased by a similar factor in this redshift range , i.e. much more than expected by studies at other wavelengths affected by dust extinction .",
    "this indicates that a large fraction of present day stars were formed during a dusty starburst event .",
    "we estimate a contribution of isocam galaxies to the peak of the cirb at @xmath15 140@xmath0 m of ( 16@xmath15 ) nw m@xmath2 sr@xmath3 as compared to the measured value of ( 25@xmath17 ) nw m@xmath2 sr@xmath3 from cobe .",
    "this study therefore suggests that the isocam galaxies are responsible for the bulk of the cirb .",
    "we have started a systematic spectroscopic follow - up of these galaxies with the aim of studying their physical properties and the origin of their large sfr .",
    "franceschini et al .",
    "( 2001 ) estimated their baryonic masses to be of the order of @xmath89 by fitting their optical and near - ir luminosities with template seds ( from silva et al .",
    "1998 ) and assuming a salpeter initial mass function ( from 0.15 to 100@xmath11 ) .",
    "their colors are similar to field galaxies of similar magnitudes ( cohen 2001 ) , hence they could not have been selected on the basis of their optical colors .",
    "the technique which consists in using the spectral slope in the uv domain to correct luminosities from extinction ( meurer , heckman & calzetti 1999 ) fails to differentiate the luminous dusty galaxies detected with isocam from other field galaxies in the hdfn+ff ( cohen 2001 ) .",
    "this was to be expected since this technique only works for galaxies with @xmath90 ( meurer et al .",
    "2000 ) while most isocam galaxies are more luminous than this threshold . a property of the isocam galaxies that may give a hint on their origin is their association with small groups of galaxies . a preliminary study of 22 isocam - hdfn galaxies by cohen et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found that nearly all isocam galaxies belonged to small groups , while the fraction of field galaxies with similar optical magnitudes belonging to such groups was 68@xmath5 .",
    "the study of the full sample of isocam - hdfn galaxies by aussel et al .",
    "( 2001 ) shows that all of them belong to physical groups , hence suggests that dynamical effects such as merging and tidal interactions are responsible for their large sfr .    the space ir telescope facility ( sirtf ) will soon provide a powerful insight on the fir emission of distant dusty starbursts and its 24@xmath0 m band , less affected by confusion ,",
    "should prolongate their detection up to @xmath91 .",
    "extending the redshift range surveyed by isocam to such redshifts is particularly important to measure the direct ir emission of the distant population of lyman break galaxies , whose dust extinction remains highly uncertain ( steidel et al .",
    "however , the direct measurement of the mir and fir emission of distant galaxies will only become possible with the launch of the next generation space telescope ( ngst ) and herschel ( first ) satellite scheduled for 2009 and 2007 .",

    "we wish to thank h.flores and a.blain for fruitful comments and a.boselli for sharing his isocam catalog with us .",

    "<S> we find that the galaxies unveiled by isocam surveys are responsible for the bulk of the cirb , i.e ( 16 @xmath1 5 ) nw m@xmath2 hz@xmath3 as compared to the ( 25 @xmath1 7 ) nw m@xmath2 hz@xmath3 measured with the cobe satellite , with less than 10@xmath5 due to agns . since the cirb contains most of the light radiated over the history of star formation in the universe , this means that a large fraction of present - day stars must have formed during a dusty starburst event similar to those revealed by isocam . </S>"
