    "the ever smaller size of quantum dots implies small capacitances and accordingly large charging energies . indeed in most recent realizations of coupled quantum dots , coulomb repulsion represents the largest energy scale @xcite such that states with different electron numbers are energetically well separated",
    ". then the quantum dot array can be controlled by gate voltages and , despite a possible coupling to electron reservoirs , the dynamics is restricted to a few states with a specific electron number .",
    "this forms the basis for many realizations of spin or charge qubits .",
    "while quantum information processing is usually performed in closed systems , the possibility to couple quantum dots to electron source and drain may be useful as well .",
    "it not only can be exploited for qubit readout @xcite , but also allows one to determine the relevant system parameters .",
    "for example , upon increasing the source - drain bias , an increasing number of levels enters the voltage window such that a current measurement provides the spectrum of the coupled quantum dots . the dominating feature in the current - voltage profile",
    "is provided by the mentioned charging effects which cause coulomb blockade .",
    "further blockade mechanisms come about when in addition spin effects @xcite or phononic excitations @xcite play a role . moreover , in a dimer chain , the interplay of coulomb interaction and the topology may cause edge - state blockade @xcite .",
    "it is particularly visible in the shot noise properties of the transport process .",
    "experimental evidence for edge - state blockade will be facilitated by a high tunability of the inter - dot tunneling .",
    "a possible way to circumvent this problem is driving the conductor by an electric dipole field .",
    "then for not too small frequencies , the driving essentially renormalizes the inter - dot tunnel coupling @xcite and , thus , allows the emulation of a dimer chain with highly tunable tunneling . in the corresponding transport setting , i.e. , in the presence of electron source and drain , one expects a corresponding current suppression @xcite which has been measured in double quantum dots @xcite .",
    "moreover , the driving may have significant impact on the shot noise @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we explore the possibility for edge - state blockade in ac driven quantum dot arrays such as those sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "it is based on the recent finding that the topological properties of ac driven dimer chains can be controlled via the amplitude of a driving field @xcite .    in the regime of strong coulomb repulsion and relatively small dot - lead tunneling , an established way to describe transport are master equations of the bloch - redfield type @xcite . in combination with a floquet theory for the central system ,",
    "they can be applied to periodically driven transport problems including to the computation of shot noise @xcite .",
    "the computation of the required dissipative kernels , however , may be numerically demanding . in certain limits",
    ", however , the master equation assumes a convenient lindblad form which is easier to evaluate . for its efficient numerical treatment , we extend a previously developed matrix - continued fraction method @xcite to the computation of shot noise .     and inter dimer coupling @xmath0 , connected to the electron source ( left ) and drain ( right ) with rate @xmath1 .",
    "the applied external ac field generates an oscillation of the onsite energies with frequency @xmath2 which depends on the positions of the quantum dots , @xmath3 , therefore the inter and intra dimer distances , @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively , become relevant even for the tight - binding description . ]",

    "we consider an array of quantum dots coupled to a time - dependent electric dipole field such that the onsite energies oscillate in time with a position - dependent amplitude , see fig .",

    "the static part is given by the su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) hamiltonian @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the fermionic annihilation operator for an electron on site @xmath8 located at position @xmath3 .",
    "we will focus on a dimer chain with an even number of sites , @xmath9 , and alternating tunnel matrix elements @xmath10 .",
    "the ac field couples via the dipole operators of the chain such that the hamiltonian of the driven chain reads @xmath11 with @xmath3 the position of site @xmath8 .",
    "the distances between two neighboring sites are @xmath5 and @xmath12 , which implies a unit cell of length @xmath4 .",
    "the driving is determined by its frequency @xmath2 and amplitude @xmath13 .",
    "the topological properties of the ssh model stem from a chiral ( or sub - lattice ) symmetry @xmath14 with @xmath15 . in second quantization , this symmetry operation can be written as @xmath16 in essence , it provides a minus sign for all creation and annihilation operators with an odd site number since @xmath17 consequently , all nearest - neighbor hoppings acquire a factor @xmath18 which explains the mentioned chiral symmetry of @xmath19 .",
    "the time - dependent part of the hamiltonian consists of local terms @xmath20 which are invariant under transformation with @xmath14 .",
    "however , the sinusoidal driving allows us to obtain a minus sign via shifting the time by half a driving period , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 . formally , this can be expressed as @xmath23 we refer to this symmetry relation as `` generalized chirality '' , owing to its resemblance to the generalized parity present in symmetric bistable potentials driven by a dipole force @xcite .",
    "a consequence of the generalized chirality is that the propagator of the chain , @xmath24 , obeys the relation @xmath25 thus , the one - period propagator can be split in two symmetry - related parts , a fact that has been identified as a condition for non - trivial topological properties of a periodically driven system @xcite .",

    ", such numerical propagation schemes often lack efficiency .",
    "therefore we aim at implementing a matrix - continued fraction method @xcite which in the context of mesoscopic transport has been employed recently for the computation of time - averaged currents @xcite . here",
    "we extend this scheme to the computation of the zero - frequency noise .    for convenience ,",
    "we write the two equations of motion in block matrix notation , @xmath49 with the shorthand notation @xmath50 . to derive a matrix - continued fraction scheme , we have to bring this equation into the form of a tridiagonal recurrence relation @xcite . in the present case , this is hindered by the fact that @xmath51 depends on the time - dependent current @xmath48 which may contain higher - order harmonics . here",
    "however , we find that reliable results for the noise can still be obtained when @xmath48 is replaced by its time average .",
    "we test this assumption in [ sec : i(t ) ] .",

    "with the latter condition we compute @xmath64 and @xmath65 by iterating eqs .   and",

    "the main energy scale of the ssh hamiltonian is the bandwidth @xmath68 .",
    "if it is much smaller than the energy quanta of the driving field , @xmath69 , one may employ a high - frequency approximation to derive an effective time - independent hamiltonian that captures the long - time - dynamics of the driven system .",
    "this typically results in an effective hamiltonian with parameters renormalized by bessel functions . in this way , the ac - driving offers a possibility for tuning system parameters .",
    "a classic example is the suppression of tunneling in bistable potentials @xcite and superlattices @xcite by the purely coherent influence of an ac field .    in a dimer chain driven by an external electric field ,",

    "by contrast , the current almost vanishes in the whole topological region , i.e. , whenever the weaker condition @xmath90 is fulfilled .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the physical origin of this current suppression is not a completely vanishing effective tunnel matrix element , but must be related to topology and the corresponding edge states formed at the source and at the drain .",
    "these edge states possess two characteristic features .",
    "first , they are exponentially weakly connected and , second , they are energetically well separated from the bulk states . as a consequence , they may trap electrons and thereby interrupt the transport process such that one observes _ edge - state blockade_. as compared to its counterpart in time - independent chains @xcite , this blockade is characterized by a broad region with vanishing current , while the cdt - like suppression of current in the trivial region has a parabolic shape .      for less tunable static chains , it has been proposed to identify edge - state blockade by its characteristic shot noise properties @xcite . in particular",
    ", it has been found that the small current in the blockade regime obeys poissonian statistics ( @xmath91 ) , while the transport in the trivial regime is characterised by electron bunching @xcite .",

    "[ fig : cdt ] and select two particular driving amplitudes , one corresponding to trivial topology ( solid lines ) , the other to non - trivial topology ( dashed lines ) . for trivial topology , the current is rather insensitive to weak dissipation .",
    "the main reason for this is that in the trivial region , the transport occurs via the delocalized eigenstates of the chain while coherences between these states play a minor role @xcite . accordingly , decoherence is not a relevant issue . for non - trivial topology , by contrast",
    ", the current grows with an increasing dissipation strength @xmath102 .",
    "a physical picture for this behavior is the direct transport between edge states .",
    "since the splitting of the edge state doublet is exponentially small , the current is rather weak .",

    "we have investigated the influence of an ac driving on the current through a ssh chain whose first and last site is coupled to an electron source and drain , respectively . owing to their topological properties and the corresponding presence of edge states ,",
    "such chains have potential applications in quantum information processing . in the present case",
    "the topological properties can be controlled in a very flexible manner via driving frequency and amplitude . in",
    "topologically non - trivial parameter regions , edge states emerge and significantly influence the fano factor of the current . in turn",
    ", the fano factor may be used to measure the topological phase diagram .    for the computation of the shot noise , we started from a generalized master equation which leads to a numerical propagation scheme which",
    ", however , is not very efficient for large system sizes . to circumvent this problem ,",
    "we have developed a matrix - continued fraction method which is applicable whenever the time - dependence of the current expectation value is weak , as is the case for our model .    within a high - frequency approximation",
    ", we have mapped the driven chain to an effective time - independent model whose tunnel matrix elements are dressed by bessel functions . then in the topologically trivial region , the transport occurs via many mutually exclusive channels .",
    "as is typical for such mechanisms , we found super poissonian shot noise . in the non - trivial region , by contrast , poissonian long - distance tunneling between a pair of edge states dominates . at the zeros of bessel functions , the effective tunnel matrix elements and , thus , the current , vanish .",
    "as an interesting feature of driving - induced edge state blockade , not only the behavior of the fano factor , but also the shape of the current suppressions depends on topology .    in summary , we have shown that ac fields not only allow one to tune the topological properties of a ssh chain , but also that shot noise measurements may serve for detecting floquet topological transitions .",
