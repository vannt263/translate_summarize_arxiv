    "after the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of @xmath1cr @xcite , @xmath2dy @xcite , and @xmath3er @xcite atoms with large magnetic dipolar interaction , there have been renewed interest in the study of cold atoms , both theoretically and experimentally . the anisotropic long - range dipolar interaction acting in all partial waves in these atoms is basically different from isotropic short - range s - wave interaction acting in nondipolar atoms .",
    "polar bosonic molecules with much larger permanent electric dipole moment are also candidates for possible bec experiments @xcite .",
    "dipolar becs have novel distinct properties . due to the anisotropic dipolar interaction ,",
    "the stability of a dipolar bec depends on the scattering length as well as the trap geometry @xcite .",
    "the shock and sound waves also propagate anisotropically in a dipolar bec @xcite .",
    "anisotropic collapse has been observed and studied in a dipolar bec of @xmath1cr atoms @xcite .",
    "anisotropic rotons @xcite and anisotropic critical superfluid velocity @xcite have been suggested and studied in dipolar becs .",
    "distinct stable checkerboard , stripe , and star configurations in dipolar becs have been identified in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) optical lattice as stable mott insulator @xcite as well as superfluid soliton @xcite states .",
    "anisotropic solitons in 2d have also been suggested in dipolar becs @xcite .",
    "a new possibility of studying universal properties of dipolar becs at unitarity has been suggested @xcite .",
    "after the realization of bec of alkali - metal atoms , degenerate nondipolar gas of fermionic @xmath4li @xcite , @xmath5k @xcite , and @xmath6sr @xcite atoms were observed .",
    "later , superfluid states of paired @xmath4li @xcite and @xmath5k @xcite fermi atoms have been investigated . more recently",
    "a degenerate dipolar gas of fermionic @xmath0dy atoms with large magnetic dipole moment has been created and studied @xcite .",
    "realization of quantum degeneracy in @xmath0dy atoms should be considered as a doorway for the study of anisotropic superfluidity in dipolar fermions .",
    "fermionic polar molecules , such as @xmath5k@xmath6rb , of large permanent electric dipole moment are also considered for this purpose @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5k@xmath6rb molecule in the singlet rovibrational ground state has an electric dipole moment of 0.6 debye , thus leading to a dipolar interaction larger than in the case of @xmath0dy atoms by more than an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "one advantage of studying the effect of dipolar interaction in a degenerate dipolar fermi gas over that in a dipolar bec is the remarkable stability of the degenerate fermi gas .",
    "a bec is usually fragile or short - lived for many experiments due to three - body loss through molecule formation .",
    "the three - body loss is highly suppressed in a degenerate fermi gas due to pauli repulsion among identical fermions . on the other hand",
    "a theoretical study of a bec is much simpler than that of a degenerate fermi gas @xcite due to the existence of a simple order parameter and a simple mean - field gross - pitaevskii equation in the former case .",
    "a microscopic description of a degenerate fermi gas is complicated due to the difficulties with the antisymmetrization of a many - fermion system and finding an appropriate simple order parameter .",
    "drastic approximations are often necessary to achieve this goal for fermions .",
    "there have been several different theoretical descriptions for a degenerate nondipolar fermi gas @xcite .",
    "there have also been a few studies of the degenerate dipolar fermi gas employing different types of approximations @xcite .",
    "however , for a description of some macroscopic observables of a degenerate fermi gas , a simple hydrodynamic description @xcite often seems appropriate which does not require a precise antisymmetrization of the dynamics @xcite .",
    "the effect of antisymmetrization is included approximately via an appropriate energy or lagrangian density .",
    "a minimization of the energy leads to a well - founded variational approximation @xcite .",
    "an euler - lagrange equation derived from such a lagrangian provides further improvement over the variational results .",
    "here we present a description of the degenerate spin polarized fermi gas based on such a hydrodynamic model @xcite .",
    "the present theoretical formulation for the degenerate dipolar fermi gas starts in section [ iia ] with the standard equations of classical hydrodynamics @xcite with the appropriate equation of state including the kinetic energy of fermions filling the fermi sea and the dipolar interaction among them .",
    "the equivalent of the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation for the dipolar gas is obtained by setting the velocity field equal to zero in the hydrodynamic equations .",
    "an equivalent classical energy density is written using the local - density approximation ( lda ) @xcite",
    ". a quantum pressure term is then introduced in the lda energy density .",
    "with such a quantum pressure term , a nonlinear schrdinger - type equation is derived for the density of fermions . for a moderate number of fermions ( greater than 100 or so ) ,",
    "the quantum pressure term is negligibly small and hence has insignificant effect on the result .",
    "however , the inclusion of the quantum pressure term allows one to write a dynamical equation for fermions in the form of a nonlinear schrdinger equation to study the dynamics .",
    "the lda or the tf approximation , on the other hand , allows only the investigation of static properties of the system .",
    "for example , these approximations can not be used to study the sound propagation dynamics in fermions as in section [ iiib ] . in section [ iib ]",
    ", we present a gaussian variational approximation for the problem described by the lda energy density . in section [ iic ] ,",
    "simplified models are derived in reduced dimensions , appropriate for cigar and disk shapes of the degenerate dipolar gas when there is a strong trap in radial or in axial directions , respectively . in section [ iid ] , using the hydrodynamic model , we obtain an analytic expression for the anisotropic sound velocity in the degenerate dipolar gas . in section [ iiia ] , we present numerical results for stationary properties @xmath7 shape , size , and chemical potential @xmath7 of a trapped degenerate fermi gas of @xmath0dy atoms , and compare with results from appropriate models in reduced dimensions and variational approximation . in section [ iiib ] , the anisotropic sound propagation in an infinite dipolar degenerate gas",
    "is demonstrated numerically and the velocities so obtained are compared with the analytical results of section [ ii ] d. finally , in section iv we present a summary of our study .",
    "the normal one - component fermi gas can be in the collisionless regime where collision is rare or in the collisional hydrodynamic regime where frequent collision due to the dipolar interaction allow the system to settle to local equilibrium , where the system can be described by simple hydrodynamic equation rather than a detailed multi - particle description .",
    "here we consider the system in such a configuration .",
    "a semi - quantitative estimate for the validity of a hydrodynamic description is given by the condition that relaxation time @xmath8 is small compared to the time scale @xmath9 defined by average trap frequency @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "for contact interaction this condition can be expressed in terms of the scattering length to measure the strength of atomic interaction @xcite .",
    "the strength of dipolar interaction is usually measured in terms of the convenient length @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the magnetic moment of an atom of mass @xmath13 and @xmath14 the permeability of free space . using this length scale to measure dipolar interaction ,",
    "the condition for the validity of hydrodynamic description can be expressed as @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number of atoms , @xmath17 the oscillator length , @xmath18 the temperature , @xmath19 the fermi temperature and @xmath20 an universal function and can be taken of the order of unity @xcite under experimental conditions .",

    ", a degenerate fermi gas may not be fully irrotational and allows rotational components in the velocity field , not allowed in the present hydrodynamic formulation .",
