    "the short length of the analyzed trajectory is justified because structural properties are calculated for each water molecule , effectively improving the sampling by three order of magnitudes ( there are 1024 water molecules ) . repeating the analysis with a longer equilibration time reproduced the same results .",
    "tip5p data was collected up to 230  k , just before the approaching of the glass - transition @xcite .",
    "the position of the maximum density was obtained from 1  ns long simulations after 10  ns of equilibration in the npt ensemble .",
    "the temperature of maximum density was extracted by polynomial fitting around the maximum .",
    "variations from the literature ( see table  [ table : density ] ) may be due to size effects and a different treatment of the electrostatics .",

    "the tetrahedral order parameter for a water molecule @xmath0 is calculated as    @xmath5    where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are any of the four nearest water molecules of @xmath0 and @xmath8 is the angle formed by their oxygens@xcite .",
    "the averaged value of this order parameter over an ensemble of water molecules is denoted as @xmath9 .",
    "water structure forming capabilities were investigated by analyzing the hydrogen - bond network of each water molecule in the simulation box together with its first and second solvation shells .",
    "a maximum of four hydrogen - bonds per molecule was considered .",

    "water structures were grouped into four archetypal configurations of population p@xmath10 : the fully coordinated first and second solvation shells for a total of 16 hydrogen - bonds ( p@xmath11 , see fig .  [ fig : p4 ] for a schematic representation ) ; the fully coordinated first shell , in which one or more hydrogen bonds between the first and the second shells are missing or loops are formed ( p@xmath12 ) ; the three coordinated water molecule ( p@xmath13 ) and the rest ( p@xmath14 ) . within this representation",
    "the sum over the four populations is equal to one for each temperature .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : micro_pop ] , the temperature dependence of the four microscopic water structures is shown . among the different water models ,",
    "the qualitative behavior is strikingly similar .",
    "three main types of temperature scalings were observed : increasing population with decreasing temperature ( enthalpically stabilized ) ; increasing population with increasing temperature ( entropically stabilized ) ; with a maximum , where a turnover between enthalpic and entropic stabilization takes place at a model dependent temperature . all four water configurations fall into one of these three main classes .",
    "the population of the fully ordered structure , p@xmath11 , increases with decreasing temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig : micro_pop ] , red empty circles ) .",
    "consequently , this configuration is enthalpically stabilized .",
    "this is not the case when defects in the hydrogen bond structure are introduced ( p@xmath15 , filled red circles ) . for this configuration",
    "the population increases with decreasing temperature until it reaches a maximum in correspondence to a rapid increase of the population of the fully - coordinated configuration .",
    "the maximum is located in a temperature range close to the temperature of maximum density of the model under consideration ( dashed vertical line ) . finally ,",
    "both p@xmath13 and p@xmath14 are mainly entropically stabilized , showing larger populations at higher temperatures .",
    "taken together , these results indicate that specific water configurations dominate at each temperature range : full - coordination extending to at least two solvation shells at low temperatures , four - coordinated configurations with no spatial extension at intermediate temperatures and mainly disordered ones at higher temperatures .    despite these similarities ,",
    "an important difference among the models is the temperature range at which the relative configurations become dominant .",
    "for example , the maximum population of p@xmath15 for the spc model was observed around @xmath16  k ( table  [ table : density ] .",
    "this is not the case for tip4p/2005 , where the maximum is located at a 40  k larger temperature .",
    "the same behavior was observed comparing the temperatures at which p@xmath11 and p@xmath13 are equal ( e.g. , around 270 k for tip4p/2005 ) .",
    "these observations suggested that a temperature shift factor ( @xmath17 ) exists among the models .",
    "using tip4p/2005 as a reference , we found a temperature shift factor for each model ranging from 65  k to 6  k ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : deltats ] and table  [ table : density ] ) .",
    "tip4p/2005 was chosen as reference for its ability to reproduce the density curve @xcite . applying this shift to the data allowed the superposition of all models onto four master curves , one for each structural configuration , as shown in the monochrome plot at the bottom right of fig .",
    "[ fig : micro_pop ] .",
    "our observation is consistent with previously found phase diagram shifts among different water models @xcite as well as in the presence of ions @xcite but in this case we could superimpose all models onto a master curve .",
    "unfortunately , tip5p had to be excluded from the superposition because all points show an increased curvature with respect to the other models , consistent with the increased curvature of the isobaric density at 1 atm  @xcite .",
    "the structural temperature shift is larger for three - site models ( fig .",
    "[ fig : deltats ] ) with a spread of up to 65k for tip3p . on the other hand ,",
    "four - site models deviate less .",
    "both spc - e and tip4p are characterized by a temperature shift with respect to tip4p/2005 of around 20k . in general ,",
    "models providing a better estimation of the position of the density maximum deviate less .     with respect to the tip4p/2005 model .",
    "tip5p was excluded from the superposition analysis ( see text for details ) .,width=302 ]     data when a skinner definition @xcite for the hydrogen bond is used.,width=302 ]      at all temperatures , water models with smaller shifts provide an improved stabilization of the fully coordinated configuration .",
    "( alternatively , it can be said that these models destabilize poorly hydrogen - bonded configurations ) . to make this point clearer , the free energy of the fully coordinated configuration at 230k was calculated ( fig .",
    "[ fig : energy]a and methods ) . at this temperature p@xmath11 is appreciably large for all water models .",
    "comparison with the temperature shifts of fig .",
    "[ fig : deltats ] indicates a remarkable correlation where even the small differences between spc - e and tip4p are respected interestingly , enthalpy and free energy correlate very well within the same model family .",
    "this is particularly clear when looking at the three sites models ( i.e. , the trend for tip3p , spc and spc / e ) , suggesting a different entropic contribution between three and four sites models which is systematic .",
    "finally , the average value of the tetrahedral order parameter @xmath9 @xcite of the fully coordinated configuration calculated at the same temperature is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy]c . in first approximation ,",
    "the parameter correlates well with the structural shift although not as good as the free energy ( ) .    .",

    "four - site models were compared to tip4p/2005 ( filled circles ) .",
    "three - site models were compared to spc / e ( empty circles ) .",
    "crosses refer to the case when tip4p/2005 was used as reference for the three - site models.,width=340 ]          it is worth commenting on the relation between the structural temperature shifts found in this work and the model - dependent temperature of maximum density . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tshifts ] and table  [ table : density ] , the relationship between the structural @xmath17 and the density @xmath20 temperature shifts is linear within the three or the four - sites models ( filled and empty circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : tshifts ] ) .",
    "however , when comparing all models together using tip4p/2005 as reference a small systematic deviation is observed ( filled circles and crosses in the figure ) .",
    "this is due to the relation that exists between the populations p@xmath21 and the density .",
    "it is noted that the relative position of the p@xmath15 maximum with respect to the temperature of maximum density ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : micro_pop ] , see also table  [ table : density ] ) depends on the model family . for four - sites models the two temperatures",
    "are identical , while for three and five - sites models the maximum of p@xmath15 is found at a higher and a lower temperature , respectively .",
