    "since the seminal papers by bell @xcite and kochen - specker @xcite we know that quantum mechanics is incompatible with the assumptions of local realism ( lr ) and non - contextuality ( nc ) .",
    "nc / lr hypothesis states that all measurable properties of a physical system do not depend on the context in which they are measured . more precisely ,",
    "suppose a given physical system has properties @xmath0 that yield outcomes @xmath1 with some probability distributions @xmath2 .",
    "suppose that the property @xmath3 can be co - measured with the property @xmath4 giving us a probability distribution @xmath5 or it can be co - measured with the property @xmath6 giving a probability distribution @xmath7 .",
    "we say that @xmath3 can be measured in the context of @xmath4 or @xmath6 .",
    "nc / lr states that there exists a joint probability distribution @xmath8 such that @xmath5 and @xmath7 are recovered as marginals .",
    "note that it might be impossible to measure @xmath8 for some reasons .",
    "for instance , in quantum theory , one can not co - measure two orthogonal components of spin .",
    "nc / lr can be extended to more properties @xmath9 and is equivalent to the existence of a joint probability distribution ( jpd ) for all the properties @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "nc / lr is a very plausible hypothesis based on our everyday experience .",
    "the colour of your car , defined by its spectral profile , would be the same regardless if you looked at it together with prof .",
    "kochen or prof .",
    "all classical theories of matter are compatible with nc / lr .    in nc / lr tests , context can be established in two different ways .",
    "the most common one , which we call bell scenario , is to assume that @xmath3 is measured in alice s laboratory whereas @xmath4 and @xmath6 , who provide context for @xmath3 , are measured in spatially separated bob s laboratory .",
    "we guarantee the lack of mutual influence between measurements in different laboratories by invoking the fact that information can not propagate faster than light ( in fact , it is enough to assume that there is a finite speed of information propagation ) .",
    "the less common but more general scenario , which we call kochen - specker one , is where there is no division into subsystems and all observables are measured on the same system .",
    "the context for @xmath3 is provided by @xmath11 whose lack of influence on @xmath3 is guaranteed by the so - called no - disturbance assumption .",
    "it is therefore clear that lr is a special case of nr and no - signaling is a special case of no - disturbance .",
    "no - disturbance has not been justified by any general principle such as the finite propagation of information but it can be tested for any physical system .",
    "simply measure @xmath3 alone and then measure @xmath3 followed by measurement of @xmath4 .",
    "repeat the whole procedure in reverse order .",
    "do the same for @xmath3 and @xmath6 .",
    "if obtained statistics for @xmath3 , i.e. , the probability distribution @xmath12 is the same in all scenarios then you conclude that no - disturbance holds .",
    "this way we can verify that quantum mechanics is a no - disturbance theory .",
    "classical theories of matter are , by their very foundations , no - disturbance theories .",
    "it was bell who showed that lr can be tested experimentally in bell scenario @xcite .",
    "experiments followed @xcite clearly demonstrating that quantum mechanics violates lr .",
    "the kochen and specker @xcite assertion that indivisible quantum mechanical systems are contextual seemed to be impossible to test experimentally in kochen - specker scenario until the paper by klyachko - can - biniciouglu - schumovsky ( kcbs ) @xcite whose kcbs inequality was tested experimentally @xcite .",
    "it is interesting from the sociological point of view that it took 50 years to experimentally test kochen - specker theorem whereas bell scenario was tested within 20 years of its formulation .",
    "more formally , bell and kochen - specker scenario can be tested via violation of non - contextuality inequalities .",
    "many such inequalities have been derived for both scenarios .",
    "all derivations start from assuming that there is a jpd for all observables used to test a given system .",
    "one then manipulates this hypothetical jpd to obtain an expression that involves only measurable marginal probability distributions and it is bounded from below and above by certain bounds resulting from the assumption about the existence of jpd .",
    "however , inequalities that test lr and nc can be formulated in many ways .",
    "for example , the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality @xcite uses correlation functions between four measurements , but the same four - measurement scenario can be a base for a derivation of an inequality that utilizes only probabilities @xcite , or give rise to an inequality involving entropies of these measurements @xcite .",
    "each of these inequalities requires a different approach to the jpd problem .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask whether there exist some more general approach that treats all types of inequalities on the same footing and that uses some other assumption than the existence of jpd .    here",
    ", we expand the idea of schumacher @xcite that bell inequalities can be expressed as a violation of the properties of the distance measure , and show that such a unification is possible for a large class of inequalities .",
    "this can be done under an assumption that an information distance between measurements is well defined on any pair of measurements ; even on measurements that can not be jointly measured . as a consequence ,",
    "triangle inequality for a distance measure is always obeyed for any three measurements .",
    "moreover , we show that properties of the distance measure imply a monogamy relation between violations of some of these inequalities .    as mentioned above",
    ", bell scenario is a special case of kochen - specker scenario at least from the mathematical point of view .",
    "there are some researchers who give a special status to bell scenario claiming that no - disturbance can not be experimentally verified .",
    "they give a simple argument saying that a physical system can have a memory of what context has been used and then return outcomes compatible with no - disturbance hypothesis .",
    "it is indeed an open problem but we do not want to discuss it here . our goal is to study the properties of contextual theories . in this sense , this paper can be considered as a purely mathematical speculation that we nevertheless hope will be useful in deepening our understanding of why nature is fundamentally non - classical .",
    "in this section we postulate a new principle that we call _ the triangle principle_. this principle allows us to derive a large class ( we explain later exactly what class it is ) of non - contextuality and bell inequalities as well as their monogamies .",
    "we start with an abstract metric space with a distance function @xmath13 between any two points @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "consider an arbitrary discrete subset of points @xmath16 , @xmath17 , ... that belong to this space .",
    "it can be easily shown that @xmath18 is the shortest distance between @xmath16 and @xmath17 and that any other path from @xmath16 to @xmath17 that goes through @xmath19 other points in this subset @xmath20 is never shorter than @xmath18 .",
    "more formally , @xmath21 to prove this one simply starts with a triangle inequality @xmath22 since @xmath23 does not appear in ( [ ineq ] ) , one uses another triangle inequality to bound this element from above @xmath24 which after substitution to ( [ i2 ] ) gives @xmath25 the above procedure , that utilizes triangle inequality , is applied untill all elements from ( [ ineq ] ) are obtained . a schematic picture corresponding to the case of five points is presented in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] .     in a metric space",
    "the shortest distance from @xmath3 to @xmath4 is always @xmath26 ( red line ) .",
    "this can be shown via multiple application of the triangle inequality .",
    "dashed lines represent distances that do not occur in an alternative path from @xmath3 to @xmath4 ( solid black lines ) , but are used to show that the length of this path is never shorter than @xmath26 . ]",
    "let us consider an experiment where we measure some properties of a physical system denoted as @xmath27 .",
    "each property @xmath14 yields an outcome @xmath28 with probability @xmath29 .",
    "we further assume that only certain pairs of properties can be simultaneously measured .",
    "for instance , it is possible to obtain the probability distribution @xmath5 for @xmath3 and @xmath4 but not for @xmath3 and @xmath6 etc .",
    "we are not interested in probability distributions involving more than two properties although they might be measurable in the experiment .",
    "we introduce a distance function @xmath13 between two probability distributions @xmath29 and @xmath30 having a joint probability distribution @xmath31 .",
    "this function must be 1 .",
    "non - negative and @xmath32 if and only if @xmath33 2 .",
    "symmetric @xmath34 3 .",

    "_ it is defined for binary random variables ( @xmath37 ) as @xmath38    _ entropic distance @xcite .",
    "_ definition is as follows @xmath39 where @xmath40 is shannon conditional entropy , therefore @xmath41 .",
    "interestingly , it is also a distance measure if one replaces shannon entropy by algorithmic entropy @xcite .",
    "_ kolmogoroff distance .",
    "_ it reads @xmath42 where @xmath43 denote some particular events , for instance , for binary variables we could have @xmath44 .",
    "it is a simple exercise in venn diagrams to prove that @xmath45 is a proper distance measure .",
    "we are ready now to formulate the triangle principle :    _ a distance measure @xmath13 is well defined on all marginal distributions @xmath46 regardless if they can be measured or not .",
    "_    in the next section we show that this principle unifies correlation , probability and entropic bell and non - contextuality inequalities for @xmath47 cyclicaly compatible measurements in a more general framework .",
    "to illustrate this principle we consider non - contextuality inequalities for @xmath47 binary measurements @xmath48 ( each @xmath49 takes only two values ) that are cyclically compatible , i.e. , measurement @xmath49 can be jointly measured with @xmath50 ( modulo @xmath47 ) @xcite .",
    "first , we explicitly present the cases of @xmath51 followed by an arbitrary @xmath47 .",
    "the case @xmath52 is particularly interesting since if @xmath16 is co - measurable with @xmath17 , @xmath17 with @xmath53 , and @xmath53 with @xmath16 , one may think that all three observables are jointly measurable .",
    "this is true in quantum mechanics , however one can consider generalized probabilistic theories ( gpt ) in which pairwise compatible measurements are not jointly compatible @xcite .",
    "a special version of this problem was studied by specker , who considered @xmath49 to be three exclusive events @xcite .",
    "we use notation @xmath54 to denote that @xmath49 occured , and @xmath55 to denote that it did not occur . due to exclusivity",
    "the following holds : @xmath56 we refer to this inequality as the specker inequality or the specker principle .",
    "it is obeyed in classical and quantum theory but it can be violated in gpt @xcite .",
    "let us consider three binary measurements @xmath57 and invoke the triangle principle , i.e. , assume that there is a well defined information distance between all three measurements .",
    "therefore , the inequality ( [ ineq ] ) gives @xmath58 we show that this general inequality is equivalent to a correlation inequality , an entropic inequality , or a probability inequality ( specker s inequality ) , if one chooses a proper distance function .",
    "although these three inequalities are satisfied in quantum theory , we show that they can be violated in general probabilistic theories ( gpt ) . therefore , gpt do not obey the triangle principle .",
    "_ covariance distance .",
    "_ the inequality ( [ n3 ] ) becomes @xmath59 which gives @xmath60 the above inequality is clearly the correlation non - contextuality inequality discussed in @xcite .",
    "although it is obeyed in quantum theory , it can be violated up to 3 in gpt by the following no - disturbance probability distribution @xmath61 with all the remaining probabilities equal to zero . in all further example",
    "we only list non - zero probabilities in any given probability distribution .",
    "_ entropic distance . _",
    "the entropic version of ( [ n3 ] ) gives @xmath62 it is also obeyed in quantum theory , however the gpt no - disturbance distribution @xmath63 leads to its violation , i.e. , one gets a contradiction that @xmath64 .",
    "note that the distribution ( [ p2 ] ) violates the inequality ( [ n3c ] ) , but the distribution ( [ p1 ] ) does not violate ( [ n3e ] ) .",
    "however , as was shown by chaves @xcite , distributions that violate correlation inequalities can be mixed with some non - contextual distributions to give distributions that violate entropic inequalities .",
    "for example , ( [ p2 ] ) can be obtain from an even mixture of ( [ p1 ] ) and a non - contextual distribution , that obeys both ( [ n3c ] ) and ( [ n3e ] ) @xmath65    _ kolmogorov distance .",
    "_ we define three events @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",

    "we get @xmath78 which after substitution of @xmath79 and division by 2 leads to the specker s inequality @xmath80 this inequality is violated up to @xmath81 by the gpt distribution ( [ p1 ] )      this case naturally describes a bipartite bell scenario in which alice measures @xmath16 and @xmath53 while bob measures @xmath17 and @xmath82 .",

    "however we use the triangle principle which assumes that these distances , although unaccessible , are well defined .",
    "we show that depending on the distance function the inequality ( [ n4 ] ) becomes the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality @xcite , the schumacher inequality @xcite , or the clauser - horne ( ch ) inequality @xcite .",
    "all three inequalities can be violated in qunatum theory provided a quantum state and measurement setups are properly chosen .",

    "_ application of the entropic distance to ( [ n4 ] ) results in the schumacher inequality , which was already defined using a distance approach @xmath89 it is also important to mention similar entropic inequalies due to braunstein - caves ( bc ) @xcite and due to cerf - adami ( ca ) @xcite .",

    "moreover , these measurements can not be naturaly distributed between two observers , therefore they are applied to a single indivisible system .",
    "this time there are ten possible distances , but only five of them are measurable and are involved in the inequality ( [ ineq ] ) @xmath98 the remaining five distances can not be measured , however the triangle principle assumes that they are properly defined and that the inequality ( [ n5 ] ) holds .",

    "we apply the kolmogorov distance to ( [ n5 ] ) and follow exactly the same steps as for @xmath52 .",
    "we arrive at @xmath108 which is a version of the kcbs inequality expresed in terms of probabilities @xcite .",
    "the discussion of cases @xmath51 shows that application of the covariance and the entropic distances readily generates correlation and entropic inequalities for general @xmath47 .",
    "the correlation inequalities that are generated are of the form @xmath109 where @xmath110 .",
    "they exactly correspond to inequalities discussed in @xcite .",
    "the entropic inequalities @xmath111 are @xmath47 element versions of schumacher inequalities @xcite and resemble n - cycle conditional entropic inequalities studied in @xcite .",
    "in fact , these inequalities are symmetrized versions of conditional entropic inequalities .",
    "note that our model also applies to a bipartite bell scenario if @xmath47 is even and measurements @xmath112 are performed by alice whereas @xmath113 are performed by bob . in this case",
    "there is an additional number of distinces that can be evaluated from the experimental data .",
    "namely , every distance between alice s and bob s measurement is well defined . in this bell scenario",
    "the inequalities ( [ gnc ] ) and ( [ gne ] ) correspond to the chained bell inequalities @xcite and to the symmetric version of the multi - setting bc inequalities @xcite , respectively .    on the other hand , the form of probability inequalities that are generated via application of the kolmogorov distance depend on whether @xmath47 is even or odd . for odd @xmath47",
    "one can generate inequalities that involve @xmath47 cyclicaly exclusive events @xmath114 defined as @xmath115 .",
    "next , one considers the kolmogorov distance for @xmath116 , @xmath117 for @xmath118 and @xmath119 for @xmath120 .",

    "the case of even @xmath47 has to be explored in more details . the inequalities involving @xmath47 cyclicaly exclusive events can be violated in quantum theory and in gpt only for odd @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "we showed that for @xmath83 one can obtain a different type of inequality , namely the ch inequality .",
    "however , the application of kolmogorov distance to scenarios with @xmath122 ( even ) remains to be explored .",
    "the monogamy relation between two non - contextuality ( or bell ) inequalities can be explained as a trade - off between the violations of these inequalities .",
    "the more the first inequality is violated the less is the second . in the most interesting case ,",
    "if one inequality is violated the other is satisfied and vice versa .",
    "the monogamy relation can be studied either on a general level of gpt @xcite , or within quantum theory @xcite .",
    "monogamies in gpt are resulting from general principles like no - signaling and no - disturbance that refer to probabilities , whereas in quantum theory they derive from the very properties of operators in the hilbert space .    here",
    "we focus ont the gpt case .",
    "in particular , we show that instead of refering directly to probabilities ( no - signaling / no - disturbance ) , one can refer to general properties of a distance ( triangle inequality ) to derive monogamy relations .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that once a monogamy relation is derived for a general distance , it authomaticaly applies to every distance measure .",
    "we show how to derive a monogamy relation between a bell inequality ( @xmath83 ) and non - contextuality inequality ( @xmath97 ) @xcite and a monogamy relation between two bipartite bell inequalities ( @xmath83 ) @xcite , however we speculate that our method can be easily applied to more general cases .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that there exists a monogamy trade - off between kcbs and chsh inequalities ( corresponding to the covariance distance ) . here",
    "we show that this result can be generalized to an arbitrary distance function @xmath13 .",
    "consider two parties alice and bob sharing a bipartite system .",
    "alice has five cyclicaly compatible measurements on her subsystem @xmath123 and she randomly choses to perform two of them @xmath124 and @xmath125 ( modulo 5 ) .",
    "bob can perform one of two measurements @xmath126 or @xmath127 on his subsystem .",
    "alice s measurements can be used to test the following distance inequality ( non - contextuality inequality if one assumes jpd ) @xmath128 on the other hand , bob s measurements and two incompatible measurements of alice ( say @xmath129 and @xmath130 ) can be used to test another distance inequality ( bell inequality if one assumes jpd ) @xmath131    next , we show that if one inequality is violated , the other one is necessarily obeyed .",
    "in particular , it is enough to use the fact that the triangle inequality is always obeyed for compatible measurements to show that the following must hold @xmath132 we start with a triangle inequality @xmath133 and then we expand the last term using another triangle inequality @xmath134 we repeat this procedure one more time to obtain @xmath135 next , we follow similar steps to obtain @xmath136 finaly , we sum ( [ m1 ] ) and ( [ m2 ] ) to get ( [ mono ] ) .",
    "consider three parties ( alice , bob and charlie ) sharing a tripartite system .",
    "each of them performs one of two measurements on their subsystems @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "note , that due to spacelike separation the measurements @xmath124 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 ( @xmath142 ) are mutualy compatible .",
    "next , consider two bell inequalities @xmath143 using the same methods as in the previous example we can show that @xmath144 and @xmath145 the sum of these two inequalities gives the monogamy relation @xmath146",
    "the triangle principle is an assumption about nature on the same footing as the nc / lr assumption .",
    "both assume some mathematical properties of observed and un - observed probability distributions in nature .",
    "nc / lr assumes an existence of a hypothetical jpd that can not be obtained in an experiment .",
    "the triangle principle assumes an existence of a function assigning numbers corresponding to distances between non - measurable properties .",
    "mathematicaly speaking , nc / lr treats measurements and outcomes as points in a space with a measure ( probability ) , whereas the triangle principle introduces a metric to this space which allows us to study the relation between these points using a geometric intuition .",
    "as we showed , this allows us to unify different types of non - contextuality and bell inequalities in a more general framework and to derive more general monogamy relations .",
    "we would like to highlight once more that _ the triangle principle _ leads to distance inequalities that are mathematically identical to known bell and non - contextual inequalities but they are based on different assumptions . therefore , their violations do not imply contextuality in kochen - specker scenario and lack of local realism in bell scenario .",
