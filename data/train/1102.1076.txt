    "at the very origin of the theory of quantum groups is the search of an algebraic procedure for constructing solutions of the quantum yang - baxter equation @xmath4 the unknown @xmath5 of this equation is an endomorphism of @xmath6 for some finite - dimensional vector space @xmath7 .",
    "this endomorphism depends on a parameter @xmath8 , and we denote by @xmath9 the endomorphism of @xmath10 acting via @xmath5 on the product of the @xmath11th and @xmath12th factors , and via @xmath13 on the remaining factor .",
    "the yang - baxter equation appeared in several different guises in the literature on integrable systems ( see @xcite for a nice selection of early papers on the subject ) .",
    "as is well known , drinfeld and jimbo showed how to associate a solution of ( [ yb ] ) with every irreducible finite - dimensional representation @xmath7 of a quantum loop algebra @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath15 is a simple complex lie algebra , @xmath16 $ ] is its loop algebra , and @xmath14 denotes the quantum analogue of the enveloping algebra of @xmath17 with parameter @xmath18 not a root of unity .",
    "this gives a strong motivation for studying the category @xmath19 of finite - dimensional representations of @xmath14 , and many authors have brought important contributions ( see @xcite ) . in particular",
    "the simple objects of @xmath19 have been classified by chari and pressley , an appropriate notion of @xmath0-character has been introduced by frenkel and reshetikhin , and , when @xmath15 is of simply laced type , nakajima has calculated the irreducible @xmath0-characters in terms of the cohomology of certain quiver varieties .    after reviewing these results in the first two lectures",
    ", we will turn to more recent attempts to understand the tensor structure of @xmath19 . in the case of @xmath20 , chari and pressley",
    "@xcite proved that every simple object is a tensor product of kirillov - reshetikin modules .",
    "these irreducible representations ( which are defined for every @xmath15 ) are very particular .",
    "they also come from the theory of integrable systems @xcite where they were first studied in relation with row - to - row transfer matrices .",
    "however , if @xmath15 is different from @xmath21 , the kirillov - reshetikin modules are not the only prime simple objects and the situation is far more complicated .",
    "thus , already for @xmath22 we do not know a factorization theorem for simple objects .    in the last lecture",
    ", we will explain a general conjecture ( for @xmath15 of simply - laced type ) which would imply that the prime tensor factorization of many simple objects can be described as the factorization of a cluster monomial into a product of cluster variables .",
    "in retrospect , this should not be too surprising , since one of the first applications of cluster combinatorics given by fomin and zelevinsky was the proof of zamolodchikov s periodicity conjecture for @xmath23-systems @xcite , also intimately related with the representation theory of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "our conjecture , which involves a positive integer @xmath24 , is now proved when @xmath2 @xcite , but the general case remains open .",
    "in this first lecture , we review the definition of quantum loop algebras , the classification of their finite - dimensional irreducible representations , and the notion of @xmath0-character . for simplicity ,",
    "we only consider quantum loop algebras of simply laced type @xmath25 .",
    "we also formulate the @xmath26-systems satisfied by the @xmath0-characters of the kirillov - reshetikhin modules .",
    "all this is illustrated in the case of @xmath27 .",
    "we briefly explain the connection with the yang - baxter equation . finally , we introduce some interesting tensor subcategories of the category of finite - dimensional representations , which will be used in  [ sect_4 ] .    for a recent and more complete survey on these topics , see @xcite .",
    "let @xmath15 be a simple lie algebra over @xmath28 of type @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "we denote by @xmath31 $ ] the set of vertices of the dynkin diagram , by @xmath32_{i , j\\in i}$ ] the cartan matrix , and by @xmath33 the set of simple roots .",
    "let @xmath16 $ ] be the loop algebra of @xmath15 .",

    "this is an algebra over @xmath28 defined by a presentation with infinitely many generators @xmath36 and a list of relations which we will not repeat ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these relations depend on @xmath18 which we assume is not a root of unity . if @xmath37 denote the chevalley generators of @xmath15 then @xmath38 is a @xmath0-analogue of @xmath39 , @xmath40 is a @xmath0-analogue of @xmath41 , and @xmath42 stands for the @xmath0-exponential of @xmath43 . in fact",
    "@xmath14 is isomorphic to a quotient of the quantum enveloping algebra @xmath44 attached by drinfeld and jimbo to the affine kac - moody algebra @xmath45 .",
    "it thus inherits from @xmath44 the structure of a hopf algebra .",
    "our main object of study is the category @xmath19 of finite - dimensional @xmath14-modules .",
    "since @xmath14 is a hopf algebra , @xmath19 is an abelian monoidal category .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath19 is not semisimple .",
    "we denote by @xmath46 its grothendieck ring . given two objects @xmath47 and @xmath48 of @xmath19 ,",
    "the tensor products @xmath49 and @xmath50 are in general not isomorphic .",
    "however , they have the same composition factors with the same multiplicities , so @xmath46 is a commutative ring . for every @xmath51 there exists an automorphism @xmath52 of @xmath14 given by @xmath53 ( this is a quantum analogue of the automorphism @xmath54 of @xmath17 . )",
    "each automorphism @xmath52 induces an auto - equivalence @xmath55 of @xmath19 , which maps an object @xmath47 to its pullback @xmath56 under @xmath52 .      by drinfeld",
    "s presentation , the generators @xmath57 and @xmath40 are pairwise commutative .",
    "so every object @xmath47 of @xmath19 can be written as a finite direct sum of common generalized eigenspaces for the simultaneous action of the @xmath42 and of the @xmath40 .",
    "these common generalized eigenspaces are called the _ l_-weight - spaces of @xmath47 .",
    "( here _ l _ stands for `` loop '' ) .",
    "the @xmath0-character of @xmath47 , introduced by frenkel and reshetikhin @xcite , is a laurent polynomial with positive integer coefficients in some indeterminates @xmath58 , which encodes the decomposition of  @xmath47 as the direct sum of its _ l_-weight - spaces .",
    "more precisely , the eigenvalues of the @xmath59 in an _ l_-weight - space @xmath7 of @xmath47 are always of the form @xmath60 for some nonzero complex numbers @xmath61 .",
    "moreover , they completely determine the eigenvalues of the @xmath62 and of the @xmath42 on @xmath7 .",
    "we encode this collection of eigenvalues with the laurent monomial @xmath63 the collection of eigenvalues ( [ eq24 ] ) , or equivalently the monomial ( [ eq23 ] ) , will be called the _ l_-weight of @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "one then defines the @xmath0-character of @xmath65 by @xmath66 where the sum is over all _",

    "2.4 ) ) .",
    "the laurent polynomial @xmath67 depends only on the class of @xmath47 in @xmath46 , and the induced map @xmath68 is an injective ring homomorphism .",
    "the subalgebra of @xmath14 generated by @xmath69 is isomorphic to @xmath70 .",
    "hence every @xmath65 can be regarded as a @xmath70-module by restriction .",
    "the _ l_-weight - space decomposition of @xmath47 is a refinement of its decomposition as a direct sum of @xmath70-weight - spaces .",
    "let @xmath71 be the weight lattice of @xmath15 , with basis given by the fundamental weights @xmath72 .",

    "we denote by @xmath108 the corresponding simple object of @xmath19 . in particular , the modules @xmath109 are called the fundamental modules .",
    "it is known ( * ? ? ?",
    "2 ) that the grothendieck ring @xmath46 is the polynomial ring over @xmath110 in the classes of the fundamental modules .      for @xmath83 , @xmath111 and @xmath51 , the simple object @xmath112 with highest _ l_-weight @xmath113",
    "is called a kirillov - reshetikhin module .",
    "thus @xmath112 is an affine analogue of the irreducible representation of @xmath70 with highest weight @xmath114 . in particular for @xmath115 , @xmath116 coincides with the fundamental module @xmath117 . by convention",

    ", one can calculate inductively the expression of any @xmath120 $ ] as a polynomial in the classes @xmath124 $ ] of the fundamental modules .",
    "thus , one can obtain the @xmath0-characters of all the kirillov - reshetikhin modules once the @xmath0-characters of the fundamental modules are known .",
    "let us illustrate the previous statements for @xmath125 . here",
    "@xmath126 , and we may drop the index  @xmath11 in @xmath87 , @xmath127 , @xmath89 , @xmath128 , @xmath120 $ ] .",
    "we have @xmath129 .",

    "then , chari and pressley have proved that the simple module @xmath95 with highest _",

    "let us briefly indicate how quantum loop algebras give rise to families of solutions of the quantum yang - baxter equation . a nice introduction to these ideas",
    "is given by jimbo in @xcite .",
    "consider the tensor product @xmath150 of kirillov - reshetikhin modules for @xmath27 .",
    "for a generic choice of @xmath151 , the @xmath0-segments @xmath152 and @xmath153 are in general position , and therefore @xmath150 is irreducible .",
    "moreover , since the grothendieck group is commutative , when the tensor product is irreducible it is isomorphic to @xmath154",
    ". therefore , there exists up to normalization a unique isomorphism @xmath155 now , if @xmath156 is another @xmath0-segment in general position with @xmath152 and @xmath153 , then @xmath157 and @xmath158 are two isomorphisms between the irreducible modules @xmath159 and @xmath160 , hence they are proportional .",
    "these intertwinners can be normalized in such a way that @xmath161 putting @xmath162 where @xmath71 is the linear map from @xmath154 to @xmath150 defined by @xmath163 , it follows that @xmath164 moreover it can be seen that @xmath165 only depends on @xmath166 , thus setting @xmath167 and @xmath168 , we obtain that @xmath169 that is , @xmath5 is a solution of the yang - baxter equation ( [ yb ] ) .",
    "these solutions were obtained by tarasov @xcite .",

    "in fact , for @xmath172 , eq .  ( [ eqkr1 ] ) shows that the tensor product @xmath173 is not irreducible , and one can check that @xmath173 is not isomorphic to @xmath174 .",
    "more generally , the same method can be applied to any finite - dimensional irreducible representation @xmath175 of @xmath14 , using the general fact that @xmath176 is irreducible except for a finite number of values of @xmath8 .",
    "we shall return to this special feature of quantum loop algebras in  [ sect_4 ] .",
    "since the dynkin diagram of @xmath15 is a bipartite graph , we have a partition @xmath177 such that every edge connects a vertex of @xmath178 with a vertex of @xmath179 .",

    "therefore , the description of the simple objects of @xmath19 essentially reduces to the description of the simple objects of @xmath183 .",

    "the characters of the irreducible finite - dimensional @xmath70-modules are identical to those of the corresponding @xmath15-modules , and are thus given by the classical weyl character formula .",
    "moreover , kashiwara s theory of crystal bases gave rise to a uniform combinatorial description of these characters , generalizing the young tableaux descriptions available for @xmath203 .",
    "the situation is much more complicated for @xmath14 . indeed , there is no analogue of weyl s formula in this case , and it is believed that only kirillov - reshetikhin modules ( and their irreducible tensor products ) have a crystal basis ( see @xcite for the existence of crystals of kr - modules for @xmath15 of classical type ) .",
