    "the fundamental structural feature of frames that are not riesz bases is the overcompleteness of its elements . to date , even partial understanding of this overcompleteness has been restricted to limited examples , such as finite - dimensional frames , frames of windowed exponentials , or frames of time - frequency shifts ( gabor systems ) .",
    "the ideas and results presented here provide a quantitative framework for describing the overcompleteness of a large class of frames .",
    "the consequences of these ideas are : ( a )  an array of fundamental new results for frames that hold in a general setting , ( b )  significant new results for the case of gabor frames , as well as a new framing of existing results that clarifies their meaning , and ( c )  the presentation of a novel and fruitful point of view for future research .",
    "due to the length of this work , it is natural to present it in two parts .",
    "the first part , containing the theoretical and structural results that have driven the research , forms this paper .",
    "the second part , containing the applications to gabor frames , will appear in the paper @xcite ( hereafter referred to as `` part  ii '' ) .    at the core of our main results is theorem  [ densityredundancy ] .",
    "the precise statement of the theorem requires some detailed notation , but the essence of the result can be summarized as follows .",
    "we begin with two frames @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath2 is a discrete abelian group , and introduce a notion of the localization of  @xmath9 with respect to @xmath10 .",
    "the idea of localization is that it describes the decay of the coefficients of the expansion of elements of @xmath9 in terms of the elements of @xmath10 . to make this notion of decay meaningful , a map @xmath11 from the index set @xmath12 into the index set @xmath2 is introduced . with this setup ,",
    "theorem  [ densityredundancy ] establishes a remarkable equality relating three seemingly unrelated quantities : certain averages of @xmath13 and @xmath14 of frame elements with corresponding canonical dual frame elements , which we refer to as _ relative measures _ , and the density of the set @xmath6 in @xmath2 .",
    "this equality between density and relative measure is striking since the relative measure is a function of the frame elements , while the density is solely determined by the index set  @xmath12 and the mapping @xmath5 .",
    "the impact of theorem  [ densityredundancy ] comes in several forms .",
    "first , the result itself is new , and its consequences along with related ideas discussed in more detail below represent a significant increase in the understanding of the structure of abstract frames .",
    "second , the application of theorem  [ densityredundancy ] and our other new theorems to the case of gabor frames yields new results , which will be presented in part  ii .",
    "these recover as corollaries the existing density results known to hold for gabor frames , but in doing so , shows them in a new light , as the consequence of more general considerations rather than of a particular rigid structure of the frames themselves .",
    "the notions of localization , approximation , and measure are interesting and useful new ideas which we feel will have impact beyond the results presented in this paper .",
    "in particular , it will be interesting to see to what degree wavelet frames fit into this framework , especially given recent results on density theorems for affine frames @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in addition to the fundamental equalities relating density and measures discussed above , we obtain a set of additional significant results , as follows .    first , we provide a comprehensive theory of _ localization _ of frames .",
    "localization is not a single concept , but a suite of related ideas .",
    "we introduce a collection of definitions and describe the implications among these various definitions .",
    "we also introduce a set of _ approximation properties _ for frames , and analyze the interrelations between these properties and the localization properties .",
    "second , we explore the implications of the connection between density and overcompleteness . we show that in any overcomplete frame which possesses sufficient localization , the overcompleteness must have a certain degree of uniformity . specifically , we construct an infinite subset of the frame with positive density which can be removed yet still leave a frame .",
    "we obtain relations among the frame bounds , density of the index set @xmath12 , and norms of the frame elements , and prove in particular that if @xmath9 is a tight localized frame whose elements all have the same norm then the index set @xmath12 must have uniform density .",
    "third , we explore the structure of the dual frame , showing that if a frame is sufficiently localized then its dual frame is also .",
    "we also prove that any sufficiently localized frame can be written as a finite union of riesz sequences .",
    "this shows that the feichtinger conjecture ( which has recently been shown to be equivalent to the famous _ kadison  singer conjecture _",
    "@xcite ) is true for the case of localized frames .",
    "in part  ii we apply our results to derive new implications for the case of gabor frames and more general systems of gabor molecules , whose elements are not not required to be simple time - frequency shifts of each other , but instead need only share a common envelope of concentration about points in the time - frequency plane .",
    "these include strong results on the the structure of the dual frame of an irregular gabor frame , about which essentially nothing has previously been known beyond the fact that it consists of a set of @xmath15 functions .",
    "we prove that if an irregular gabor frame is generated by a function @xmath16 which is sufficiently concentrated in the time - frequency plane ( specifically , @xmath16 lies in the modulation space @xmath17 ) , then the elements of the dual frame also lie in @xmath17 .",
    "we further prove that the dual frame forms a set of gabor molecules , and thus , while it need not form a gabor frame , the elements do share a common envelope of concentration in the time - frequency plane .",
    "moreover , this same result applies if the original frame was only itself a frame of gabor molecules .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next subsection will give a more detailed and precise summary and outline of our results .",
    "section  [ section2 ] introduces the concepts of localization and approximation properties and presents the interrelations among them .",
    "we also define density and relative measure precisely in that section .",
    "the main results of this paper for abstract frames are presented in section  [ mainsec ] .",
    "the main body of our paper begins in section  [ section2 ] , where , following the definition of density in section  [ densitysec ] , we define several types of localization and approximation properties for abstract frames in sections  [ localizationsec ] and  [ approxsec ] .",
    "localization is determined both by the frame @xmath7 and by a reference system @xmath8 .",
    "we assume the reference system is indexed by a group of the form @xmath18 with a metric on @xmath2 defined as follows . if @xmath19 , set @xmath20 if @xmath21 , otherwise @xmath22 .",
    "then given @xmath23 , set @xmath24 the metric is then @xmath25 for @xmath16 , @xmath26 .",
    "our results can be generalized to other groups ; the main properties of the group defined by that are used are that @xmath2 is a countably infinite abelian group which has a shift - invariant metric with respect to which it is locally finite",
    ". the reader can simply take @xmath27 without much loss of insight on a first reading .",
    "the additive structure of the index set @xmath2 of the reference system does play a role in certain of our results .",
    "however , the index set @xmath12 of the frame @xmath9 need not be structured .",
    "for example , in our applications in part  ii we will have an irregular gabor system @xmath28 , which has as its index set an arbitrary countable subset @xmath29 , while our reference system will be a lattice gabor system @xmath30 , indexed by @xmath31 .",
    "a set of approximation properties for abstract frames is introduced in definition  [ approxdef ] .",
    "these are defined in terms of how well the elements of the reference system are approximated by finite linear combinations of frame elements , or vice versa , and provide an abstraction for general frames of the essential features of the homogeneous approximation property ( hap ) that is known to hold for gabor frames or windowed exponentials ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we list in theorem  [ relations ] the implications that hold among the localization and approximation properties .",
    "in particular , there is an equivalence between @xmath32-column decay and the hap , and between @xmath32-row decay and a dual hap .    in section  [ selflocsec ]",
    "we introduce another type of localization . instead of considering localization with respect to a fixed reference sequence , we consider localizations in which the reference is the frame itself ( `` self - localization '' ) or its own canonical dual frame .",
    "theorem  [ selflocthm ] states that every @xmath33-self - localized frame is @xmath33-localized with respect to its canonical dual frame .",
    "the proof of this result is an application of a type of noncommutative wiener s lemma , and is given in appendix  [ selflocappend ] .",
    "we define the density of an abstract frame @xmath7 in section  [ densitysec ] .",
    "we assume there is some associated mapping @xmath5 .",
    "for example , in the gabor case , @xmath34 is an arbitrary countable sequence in @xmath35 while @xmath31 , and @xmath11 maps elements of @xmath12 to elements of  @xmath2 by rounding off to a near element of @xmath2 ( note that @xmath11 will often not be injective ) . then density is defined by considering the average number of points in @xmath6 inside boxes of larger and larger radius . by taking the infimum or supremum over all boxes of a given radius and then letting the radius increase , we obtain lower and upper densities @xmath36 . by using limits with respect to an ultrafilter @xmath37 and a particular choice of centers @xmath38 for the boxes , we obtain an entire collection of densities @xmath39 intermediate between the upper and lower densities ( for background on ultrafilters , we refer to ( * ? ? ?",
    "3 ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "a ) ) .    the relative measure of an abstract frame sequence @xmath7 with respect to a reference frame sequence @xmath8 is introduced in section  [ relativemeasure ] . for simplicity , in this introduction",
    "we discuss only the case where both are frames for the entire space ; in this case we speak of the _ measures _ of @xmath9 and @xmath10 instead of the _ relative measures_. furthermore we will discuss here only the case where @xmath10 is a riesz basis , so that its measure is @xmath40",
    ". let @xmath41 denote the discrete `` box '' in @xmath2 centered at @xmath42 and with `` side lengths '' @xmath43 ( see equation for the precise definition ) .",
    "let @xmath44 denote the preimage in @xmath12 of @xmath41 under the map  @xmath5 .",
    "we declare the lower measure of the frame @xmath9 to be @xmath45 and make a similar definition for the upper measure @xmath46 ( note that @xmath47 for all  @xmath48 ) .",
    "we also define the measure @xmath49 with respect to an ultrafilter @xmath37 and a particular choice of box centers @xmath50 .",
    "thus , as was the case with the densities , we actually have a suite of definitions , a range of measures that are intermediate between the lower and upper measures .",
    "note that if @xmath9 is a riesz basis , then @xmath51 for every  @xmath48 , so a riesz basis has upper and lower measure  @xmath40 .",
    "the definition of relative measure becomes more involved when the systems are only frame sequences , i.e. , frames for their closed linear spans . in this case , the relative measures are determined by averages of @xmath52 or @xmath53 , respectively , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the orthogonal projections onto the closed spans of @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",
    "the precise definition is given in definition  [ redundancydef ] .",
    "section  [ necessarysec ] presents two necessary conditions on the density of a frame . in theorem",
    "[ necessary ] , we show that a frame which satisfies only a weak version of the hap will satisfy a nyquist - type condition , specifically , it must have a lower density which satisfies @xmath56 . in theorem  [ finitedensity ] , we show that under a stronger localization assumption , the upper density must be finite .",
    "the connection between density and overcompleteness , which is among the most fundamental of our main results , is presented in section  [ connectsec ] .",
    "we establish a set of equalities between the relative measures and the reciprocals of the density .",
    "specifically , we prove in theorem  [ densityredundancy ] that for frame @xmath9 that is appropriately localized with respect to a riesz basis  @xmath10 , we have the following equalities for the lower and upper measures and for every measure defined with respect to an ultrafilter @xmath37 and sequence of centers @xmath50 in @xmath2 : @xmath57 moreover , we actually obtain much finer versions of the equalities above which hold for the case of a frame sequence compared to a reference system that is also a frame sequence .",
    "the left - hand side of each equality is a function of the frame elements , while the right - hand side is determined by the index set alone . as immediate consequences of these equalities",
    "we obtain inequalities relating density , frame bounds , and norms of the frame elements .",
    "in particular , we show that if @xmath9 and @xmath10 are both localized tight frames whose frame elements all have identical norms , then the index set @xmath12 must have uniform density , i.e. , the upper and lower densities of @xmath12 must be equal .",
    "thus tightness necessarily requires a certain uniformity of the index set .",
    "the equalities in suggest that relative measure is a quantification of overcompleteness for localized frames . to illustrate this connection ,",
    "let us recall the definition of the _ excess _ of a frame , which is a crude measure of overcompleteness .",
    "the excess of a frame @xmath58 is the cardinality of the largest set @xmath59 such that @xmath60 is complete ( but not necessarily still a frame ) .",
    "an earlier paper @xcite showed that there is an infinite @xmath61 such that @xmath60 is still a frame if and only if there exists an infinite set @xmath62 such that @xmath63 the set @xmath59 to be removed will be a subset of @xmath64 , but , in general , the technique of @xcite will construct only an extremely sparse set @xmath59 ( typically zero density in the terminology of this paper ) .",
    "if @xmath65 , then will be satisfied for some @xmath64 ( see proposition  [ infiniteexcess ] ) , and so some infinite set can be removed from the frame .",
    "we prove in section  [ positivesec ] that if a frame is localized and @xmath66 , then not merely can some infinite set be removed , but this set can be chosen to have positive density .",
    "we believe , although we can not yet prove , that the reciprocal of the relative measure is in fact quantifying the redundancy of an abstract frame , in the sense that it should be the case that if @xmath9 is appropriately localized and @xmath66 , then there should be a subset of @xmath9 with density @xmath67 which can be removed leaving a subset of @xmath9 with density @xmath68 which is still a frame for  @xmath69 .",
    "the last of our results deals with the conjecture of feichtinger that every frame that is norm - bounded below ( @xmath70 ) can be written as a union of a finite number of riesz sequences ( systems that are riesz bases for their closed linear spans ) .",
    "it is shown in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite that feichtinger s conjecture equivalent to the celebrated kadison  singer ( paving ) conjecture . in section  [ rieszsec ]",
    ", we prove that this conjecture is true for the case of @xmath33-self - localized frames which are norm - bounded below .",
    "this result is inspired by a similar result of grchenig s from @xcite for frames which are sufficiently localized in his sense , although our result is distinct .",
    "another related recent result appears in @xcite .",
    "we believe that localization is a powerful and useful new concept . as evidence of this fact",
    ", we note that grchenig has independently introduced a concept of localized frames , for a completely different purpose @xcite .",
    "we learned of grchenig s results shortly after completion of our own major results .",
    "the definitions of localizations presented here and in @xcite differ , but the fact that this single concept has independently arisen for two very distinct applications shows its utility . in his elegant paper , grchenig has shown that frames which are sufficiently localized in his sense provide frame expansions not only for the hilbert space  @xmath69 but for an entire family of associated banach function spaces .",
    "grchenig further showed that if a frame is sufficiently localized in his sense ( a  polynomial or exponential localization ) then the dual frame is similarly localized .",
    "the following notation will be employed throughout this paper .",
    "@xmath69 will refer to a separable hilbert space , @xmath12 will be a countable index set , and  @xmath2 will be the group given by with the metric defined in .",
    "we implicitly assume that there exists a map @xmath5 associated with @xmath12 and  @xmath2 .",
    "the map @xmath11 induces a semi - metric @xmath71 on @xmath12 .",
    "this is only a semi - metric since @xmath72 need not imply @xmath73 .",
    "the finite linear span of a subset @xmath74 is denoted @xmath75 , and the closure of this set is @xmath76 .",

    "the _ frame operator _",
    "@xmath95 is a bounded , positive , and invertible mapping of @xmath69 onto itself .",
    "the _ canonical dual frame _ is @xmath96 where @xmath97 . for each @xmath98",
    "we have the _ frame expansions _ @xmath99 .",
    "we call @xmath9 a _ tight frame _ if we can take @xmath100 , and a _ parseval frame _ if we can take @xmath101 .",
    "if @xmath9 is any frame , then @xmath102 is the _",
    "canonical parseval frame _ associated to @xmath9 .",
    "we call @xmath9 a _ uniform norm frame _ if all the frame elements have identical norms , i.e. , if @xmath103 for all @xmath104 .    a sequence which satisfies the upper frame bound estimate in , but not necessarily the lower estimate ,",

    "if we also have @xmath70 , then we say the sequence is norm - bounded below .",
    "we will also consider sequences that are frames for their closed linear spans instead of for all of @xmath69 .",
    "we refer to such a sequence as a _ frame sequence_. if @xmath7 is a frame sequence , then @xmath109 will denote its canonical dual frame within @xmath110 .",
    "the orthogonal projection @xmath55 of @xmath69 onto @xmath111 is given  by @xmath112    a frame is a basis if and only if it is a riesz basis , i.e. , the image of an orthonormal basis for @xmath69 under a continuous , invertible linear mapping .",

    "the canonical dual frame @xmath109 is the unique sequence in @xmath111 that is biorthogonal to  @xmath113 , i.e. , @xmath114 .",

    "_  @xmath118 .",
    "these lower and upper densities are only the extremes of the possible densities that we could naturally assign to @xmath12 with respect to @xmath11 .",
    "in particular , instead of taking the infimum or supremum over all possible centers in we could choose one specific sequence of centers , and instead of computing the liminf or limsup we could consider the limit with respect to some ultrafilter .",
    "the different possible choices of ultrafilters and sequences of centers gives us a natural collection of definitions of density , made precise in the following definition .",
    "let @xmath37 be a free ultrafilter , and let @xmath50 be any sequence of centers @xmath119 .",
