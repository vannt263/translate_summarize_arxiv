    "the standard model for strong , weak , and electrodynamics has been very successful . nonetheless , most physicists expect that the next generation of very high energy accelerator experiments that are able to produce resonances with masses around the @xmath1 scale will find physics beyond what is in the minimal standard model .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "firstly , the mechanism for weak symmetry breaking in the minimal standard model , a single scalar doublet , is the simplest but has no direct confirmation from experiment .",
    "secondly , an awkward fine - tuning of parameters must be made , order by order in perturbation theory , to keep the physical mass of the higgs scalar very light compared to the ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "this is called the hierarchy problem and is the motivation for most of the proposed extensions of the minimal standard model with new physics at the weak scale .",
    "models with new degrees of freedom at the weak scale typically give rise to unacceptably large flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) if the new physics can couple at tree level to the quarks and the most general couplings are allowed .",
    "the minimal standard model does not have such a problem because of the gim mechanism .",
    "more generally , the large fcnc problem does not arise if the @xmath2 quark flavor symmetry is only broken by a single pair of higgs yukawa coupling matrices @xmath3 and @xmath4 . this way of suppressing fcnc",
    "is called minimal flavor violation ( mfv )  @xcite . in mfv , only scalars with the same gauge quantum numbers as the higgs doublet or color octet scalars with the same weak quantum numbers of the higgs doublet can yukawa couple to the quarks @xcite .",
    "therefore it is of interest to study the properties of such scalars .",
    "models with several color singlet , weak doublet scalars have been extensively studied . in  @xcite",
    ", certain decays of color octet scalars were studied in the context of pati - salam unification . here",
    ", we continue the phenomenological analysis of color octet scalars begun in @xcite .",
    "the tree level pair production cross section for charged or neutral color octet scalars was computed in  @xcite .",
    "the precision electroweak variables @xmath5 and @xmath6 were also computed is small . ] and a number of fcnc processes were considered . here , we calculate the one - loop production rate for a single neutral octet scalar through gluon fusion , @xmath7 .",
    "we also derive the constraint on the strength of the coupling of color octet scalars to up - type quarks that arises from experimental data on @xmath8 .",
    "this constraint restricts the magnitude of the the @xmath7 cross  section .",
    "the standard model quark yukawa couplings of the quarks to the higgs doublet @xmath9 are @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are flavor indices , and gauge indices have been omitted .",
    "repeated flavor indices are summed over .",
    "the yukawa couplings generate the mass matrices @xmath13 for the charge @xmath14 and @xmath15 quarks when the higgs field gets a vacuum expectation value @xmath16 . in the minimal standard model",
    "the only couplings that violate the @xmath2 quark flavor symmetry are the yukawa matrices @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we can view the theory as being invariant under the flavor group if the yukwawa matrices are endowed with the transformation property , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is an element of @xmath19 , @xmath20 is an element of @xmath21 and @xmath22 is an element of @xmath23 .    in this paper",
    "we add to the minimal standard model a single weak doublet of color octet scalars @xmath24 . according to mfv ,",
    "its yukawa couplings to the quarks are , @xmath25 where the matrices @xmath26 and @xmath27 also transform as @xmath28 and are composed from @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "so , @xmath29 and @xmath30 note that there is a term in the ellipses of eq .",
    "( [ series ] ) proportional to @xmath31 ; however , it does not give rise to flavor changing neutral current effects , so we neglect it .",
    "we will assume that the @xmath32 are small and that terms with more powers of the yukawa couplings are more suppressed and can be neglected .",
    "diagonalizing the quark mass matrices we find , in the quark mass eigenstate basis , that the couplings of the octet scalars take the form , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the ckm matrix and @xmath35 , @xmath36 are the charge @xmath14 and charge @xmath15 quark masses .",
    "since the top quark is by far the heaviest quark we can approximate the above by , @xmath37 the term proportional to @xmath38 gives rise to a tree level contribution to flavor changing neutral current processes like @xmath39 mixing from @xmath40 exhange . however , the leading contribution to @xmath41 does not involve @xmath38 and experimental data on this process provides an important constraint on @xmath42 .",
    "the parameter @xmath43 is constrained from data on the precision electroweak variable @xmath8 ; this is discussed in the next section .",

    "it is convenient to decompose the neutral complex octet scalars into two real scalars , @xmath52 then the tree level mass spectrum is  @xcite , @xmath53    in this paper we focus on color octet scalars with masses greater than @xmath54 .",
    "the mass splittings are expected to be small compared with this and so we neglect the mass splittings between the various color octet scalar states for the remainder of this paper .",
    "color octet scalars with masses between @xmath55gev and @xmath56tev can have a dramatic impact on the rate for higgs production at the lhc @xcite .",

    "the contribution to the effective hamiltonian for @xmath57 proportional to @xmath58 was also considered . here",
    "we complete the analysis of precision electroweak physics in this theory by computing @xmath8 , the ratio of the @xmath59 width to final hadronic states containing a @xmath60 and @xmath61 quark to the total hadronic width .",
    "we write the coupling of the @xmath59 boson to quarks @xmath62 as , @xmath63 where @xmath64 are the projectors @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "we use a supercript `` @xmath67 '' to denote the tree level standard model value of the coupling , @xmath68 we take the value of @xmath69 from the measured vector and axial vector lepton couplings at the @xmath59 pole ; then corrections to @xmath59 vacuum polarization effects from the octet scalars are absorbed into it .",
    "zbbgraphs     +    the down yukawa coupling parameter , @xmath42 , is constrained by the @xmath70 partial width to be significantly less than @xmath71 when @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , we neglect the down yukawa coupling to the @xmath60 quark , as well as neglecting quark masses other than the top .",
