    "let us now turn to the discussion of different models for the @xmath1 interaction .",

    "( [ eqleading]).@xcite        although here we are considering elastic production at small momentum transfer @xmath17 , the timelike vector meson with mass @xmath4 has to be produced from the spacelike ( or real ) photon with virtuality @xmath3 .",
    "this means , that even if there is no transverse momentum transfer , @xmath53 , there has to be a difference @xmath54 in the longitudinal momentum of the two gluons @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "therefore the identification with the ordinary diagonal gluon distribution @xmath8 is only a good approximation for very small values of @xmath9 and @xmath17 , and in the general case the process @xmath55 depends on off - diagonal parton distributions.@xcite their importance for diffractive vector meson production will be discussed in the following .",
    "off - diagonal ( also called `` skewed '' or non - forward ) parton distributions are much studied recently . in the case of small @xmath17 scattering",
    "the skewedness comes from the difference between @xmath9 and @xmath46 of the two gluons @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and the cross section can be shown to be proportional to the square of a skewed gluon distribution , @xmath56 here @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is the mass squared of the intermediate @xmath60 pair .",
    "( taking the leading imaginary part of the amplitude corresponds to cutting the amplitude as indicated by the dashed line in fig .",

    "another important issue is the treatment of the vector meson wave function . as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and eq .",
    "( [ eqfac ] ) it enters the amplitude via a convolution with the scattered @xmath13 fluctuation . in eq .",
    "( [ eqleading ] ) the non - relativistic approximation was adopted .",
    "this means , that quark and antiquark equally share the longitudinal momentum of the photon , i.e.  @xmath71 , and that there is no internal ( transverse ) momentum @xmath72 in the @xmath13 bound state .",
    "therefore , in this naive approximation , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "while this simplification may be suitable for heavy mesons like the @xmath7 , it is clear that the non - relativistic approximation has to break down for light quarks .",
    "various groups have worked on improving this approximation by including the fermi motion of the quarks in the meson by using a nontrivial wave function.@xcite different models for the meson wave function were used which lead to quite different correction factors : whereas in gaussian models there is no strong suppression @xcite , the large @xmath72 tail typical for wave functions from non - relativistic potential models seems to lead to large corrections @xcite . on the other hand , considering that within these potential models a big part of the @xmath75 corrections comes from a regime , where @xmath72 is bigger than the quark mass itself , these large corrections may well be an artefact of the non - relativistic approximation .",
    "another related problem is the question , which mass for the quarks should be used in the perturbative formulae .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eqleading ] ) is written in terms of the vector meson mass @xmath4 .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite , the full expressions used to include higher order ( relativistic ) corrections contain the quark mass @xmath76 instead of @xmath4 .",
    "as the ratio @xmath77 enters with a high power , this difference is not negligible and should be taken into account in the calculation of the @xmath75 corrections applied to eq .",
    "( [ eqleading ] ) .",
    "in addition , it is well known that there are other relativistic corrections , which in principle have to be taken into account in a consistent way .",
    "as pointed out by hoodbhoy @xcite , gauge invariance is only preserved if higher fock states ( @xmath78 , @xmath79 ) are included in the wave function . in doing",
    "so he arrives at the conclusion , that the relativistic corrections to the quark propagators plus the corrections from the higher fock states amount to only a few percent for @xmath6 production , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "after all large relativistic corrections can probably be excluded , but , as different approaches lead to quite different results there remains a considerable uncertainty and the issue a hot topic .      in this section we will discuss an alternative approach , which avoids the meson wave function and leads to results which are in surprisingly good agreement with available data .",
    "it was proposed in @xcite for @xmath10 meson electroproduction , where the hard scale is provided by @xmath3 , not by @xmath80 .",
    "dependence @xmath81 with @xmath82 gev@xmath83 for @xmath84 gev@xmath85 and the @xmath2 behaviour of the cross section @xmath86 indicate that @xmath10 meson electroproduction is not a soft , but mainly a hard process . ] due to the tiny @xmath87 and @xmath88 quark masses , in the case of the @xmath10 non - relativistic approximations can not be justified , and the wave function is not very well known .",
    "now the crucial problem was , that all naive predictions for the ratio of the longitudinal to the transverse cross section , which are based on the perturbative formula ( [ eqleading ] ) , lead to @xmath89 this is much too steep and incompatible with experimental data ( see below ) .",
    "the inclusion of effects from a light cone wave function for the @xmath10 does not change the picture considerably .",
    "receives large contributions from the small @xmath72 region , which is non - perturbative . but those contributions would cause the transverse cross section to fall off even faster with increasing @xmath3 and therefore worsen the problem @xcite . ]",
    "these observations indicate that the main effects are not coming from the @xmath10 wave function and lead to the proposal of a different model in @xcite : there the cross section for @xmath10 production is predicted via perturbative @xmath90 and @xmath91 quark pair electroproduction together with the principle of parton - hadron duality ( phd ) @xcite .",
    "phd means that the integral of the parton ( @xmath13 ) production cross section over a mass interval @xmath92 is approximately equal to the sum over all ( corresponding ) possible hadron production cross sections in the same mass interval . in the region",
    "@xmath93 the production of more complicated partonic configurations ( like @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , etc . )",
    "is heavily suppressed . on the hadronic side the @xmath10 resonance ( plus the small admixture of the @xmath97 ) with its decay into two ( three ) pions",
    "completely saturates the cross section .",
    "therefore we can well approximate the @xmath10 production cross section @xmath98 by @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 have to be chosen to embrace the @xmath10 resonance appropriately , i.e.  @xmath102 gev@xmath85 .",

    "( [ eqphdrho ] ) corrects for the contributions from @xmath97 production .    the perturbative formulae for the @xmath13 production cross section",
    "are derived from the amplitudes depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and can be written in terms of the conventional spin rotation matrices @xmath103 ( see @xcite for details ) : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the electric charge of the quark @xmath61 , @xmath34 the electromagnetic coupling and @xmath106 the polar angle of the quark @xmath61 in the @xmath13 rest frame with respect to the proton direction ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "@xmath108 are integrals over the gluon @xmath49 and given by @xmath109 with @xmath110 being the unintegrated gluon distribution and @xmath111 in eqs .",
    "( [ eqsigmalt ] ) the different rotation matrices appropriately reflect the different spin states of the @xmath13 produced from longitudinal and transverse photons , and the integrals @xmath112 contain the scattering off the proton via the two gluon exchange .",
    "channel helicity conservation ( schc ) , i.e.  the produced @xmath10 has the helicity of the virtual photon . however , there are small violations of schc ( e.g. @xmath113 ) which can be successfully described in a framework similar to the one discussed here . for a discussion of recent measurements of the 15 spin density matrix elements of @xmath10 production compared to different theoretical predictions",
    "see @xcite . ]",
    "in order to pick up only those @xmath90 , @xmath91 configurations which correspond to the quantum numbers of the @xmath10 , one has to project out the @xmath114 states .",
    "this can be easily done on amplitude level with the same rotation matrices @xmath103 , see @xcite .",
    "( even higher spin states like the @xmath115 can be projected out using the corresponding @xmath88 function @xcite . )",

    "( [ eqsigmalt ] ) , and therefore @xmath117 becomes calculable without a large uncertainty from the treatment of the ( non - perturbative ) infrared region .    for the complete numerical predictions one also has to include the contributions from the real part of the amplitudes and the skewed gluon distribution as discussed above .",
