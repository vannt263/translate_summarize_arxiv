    "the study of strongly interacting matter has been an area of contemporary research for quite sometime now .",
    "such studies are usually made in the extreme condition of temperature and/or density .",
    "the high temperature ( @xmath4 ) studies are more relevant to the ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions while the investigations involving high chemical potential ( @xmath5 ) or extreme case of cold matter are more appropriate to astrophysics @xcite .",
    "it should , however , be noted that efforts are being directed recently to also study the properties of a very dense system in the laboratory where matter with predominantly large chemical potential might be formed @xcite .",
    "we here restrict ourselves to zero temperature and investigate some of the properties of quark matter in presence of a weak magnetic field .",
    "it has been shown recently that the degenerate quark matter can show para - ferro phase transition below a critical density @xcite . to examine this possibility , in ref.@xcite , a variational calculation was performed .",
    "subsequently , various other calculations were also performed in different formalisms to investigate such a possibility with varied conclusions @xcite .",
    "the issue of spontaneous phase transition in dense quark system at zero temperature was also examined in @xcite by invoking relativistic fermi liquid theory ( rflt ) . in particular , this was accomplished by calculating the chemical potential ( @xmath5 ) and energy density of degenerate quark matter in terms of the landau parameters ( lps ) .",
    "the rflt was first developed by baym and chin @xcite to study the properties of high density nuclear matter .",
    "however , the formalism developed in ref.@xcite is valid for unpolarized matter and lps calculated there are spin averaged",
    ". here , on the other hand , we deal with polarized quark matter which requires evaluation of the lps with explicit spin dependencies .",
    "recently , in @xcite the authors have studied the magnetic properties of degenerate quark matter in presence of weak uniform external magnetic field @xmath6 .",
    "similar investigation was also made in ref.@xcite by evaluating the effective potential and employing quark magnetic moment as an order parameter .",
    "these calculations were , however , restricted to the case of unpolarized matter . on the contrary ,",
    "our concern here is the magnetic properties of polarized quark system .",
    "consequently , we first determine various spin combination of lps such as spin symmetric @xmath7 and spin anti - symmetric @xmath8 parameters and express quantities like magnetization and magnetic susceptibility in terms of these parameters .",
    "it is needless to mention that unlike @xcite , the expressions for @xmath3 and @xmath9 , as presented here , depend on the spin polarization parameter @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 correspond to densities of spin - up and spin - down quarks , respectively .",
    "it is well known that the calculations of lps require evaluation of the forward scattering amplitudes which are plagued with infrared divergences arising out of the exchange of massless gluons .",
    "formally , such divergences can be removed by using hdl corrected gluon propagator .",
    "this can also be achieved by introducing screening mass for the gluons .",
    "such regularizations are necessary for the evaluation of individual lps . on the other hand , in various physical quantities like the ones we calculate here , the lps appear in particular combinations where such divergences cancel at least to the order with which we are presently concerned .",
    "the plan of the article is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we derive the expressions of lps for polarized quark matter . in sec iii , we calculate magnetic susceptibility in terms of lps with explicit spin dependencies both with bare and hdl corrected gluon propagator . in sec .",
    "iv we summarize and conclude .",
    "in this section we calculate lps for spin polarized quark matter .",
    "we are dealing with quasi - particles whose spins are all eigenstates of the spin along a given direction _ viz . _ @xmath13 .",
    "the quasiparticle interaction can be written as the sum of two parts _ viz . _",
    "spin symmetric ( @xmath14 ) and anti - symmetric ( @xmath15 ) parameters @xcite :    f_pp^ss & = & f_pp^sym+(ss ) f_pp^asym .",
    "assuming that the spins are randomly oriented with respect to the momentum , we take average over the angles @xmath16 and @xmath17 corresponding to spins @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the angular averaged interaction parameter is given by @xcite :    [ ang_av_pp ] _",
    "pp|_p = p_f^s , p=p_f^s&= & f^ss_pp|_p = p_f^s , p=p_f^s    @xmath20 here the spin may be either parallel ( @xmath21 ) or anti - parallel ( @xmath22 ) @xcite . thus the scattering possibilities are denoted by @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 etc .",
    "the interaction parameters can now be redefined as ,    f_pp^++&=&f_pp^sym+f_pp^asym  =  f_pp^ + f_pp^+-&=&f_pp^sym - f_pp^asym  =  f_pp^-+    once these interaction parameters are known , the flps can be determined by expanding @xmath26 into the legendre polynomial :    f_l^ss=(2l+1)p_l()f_pp^ss , where @xmath27 .",
    "we define symmetric and anti - symmetric part of lps @xmath28 what one does to dealing with the isospins in nuclear matter @xcite :    f^+(-),sym_l&=&(f^++()_l+f^+-(-+)_l ) + f^+(-),asym_l&=&(f^++()_l - f^+-(-+)_l ) it should be noted here that , @xmath29 .",
    "the dimensionless lps are defined as @xmath30 @xcite , where @xmath31 is the density of states at the fermi surface , which can be written as ,    [ dos ] n^s(0)&= & ( _ ps-^s ) + & = & ( ) |_p = p_f^s here , @xmath32 is the color factor , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the spin dependent quasi - particle energy and chemical potential respectively .",
    "it is evident from eq.([dos ] ) that for spin polarized matter , the density of states is spin dependent .",
    "this , as we shall see , makes the calculation cumbersome . in the above expression @xmath35",
    "is the inverse fermi velocity @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is given by @xcite    v_f^s&= & -    with the bare propagator , the angular averaged spin dependent interaction parameter yields @xcite    f^++_pp|_p = p=p_f^+&=&-.[pp_int ] + f^+-_pp|_p = p_f^+,p=p_f^-&= & \\{1-}.[pm_int ] + here , @xmath38 is the quark mass , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the fermi momentum of the unpolarized matter @xmath42 .",
    "similarly , @xmath43 can be obtained by replacing @xmath44 with @xmath45 and @xmath46 with @xmath47 in eq.([pp_int ] ) .",
    "one can find dimensionless lps , @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( suppressing spin indices ) by considering oge interaction .",
    "but both of these @xmath48 exhibit infrared divergences because of the term @xmath49 that appear in the denominator of the interaction parameter ( see eq.([pp_int ] ) ) .",
    "this divergence disappears if one uses hdl corrected gluon propagator to evaluate the scattering amplitudes @xcite .    to construct hdl corrected gluon propagator with explicit spin dependence one needs to evaluate the expressions for longitudinal @xmath50 and transverse @xmath51 polarization which have been derived in @xcite .",
    "we borrow the results directly :    _ l(k_0,k ) & = & ( c_0 ^ 2 - 1)_s= p_f^s_f^s , [ pil ] + _ t(k_0,k)&=&c_0_s = p_f^s^2 [ pit ] .",
    "here , @xmath52 , is the dimensionless variable and @xmath53 .",
    "it might be noted here , that the expressions for @xmath54 and @xmath55 look rather similar to what one obtains in the case of unpolarized matter ( @xmath56)@xcite with only difference in @xmath57 . in the static limit _",

    "similarly one may determine other combination of lps like @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 etc . in fig.[flp",
    "] , density dependence of symmetric and anti - symmetric combination of dimensionless lps is shown .",
    "similar plots for the lps in isospin asymmetric nuclear matter can be found in @xcite .",
    "there , however , the calculated lps are finite , as the nucleon - nucleon interactions involve exchanges of massive mesons like @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 etc .",
    "it is interesting to note that the results of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter for the lps are qualitatively same as those of dense quark system .",
    "now , we proceed to calculate the magnetic susceptibility for which an uniform magnetic field @xmath6 is applied along the @xmath13 axis .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility is defined as @xcite    [ mag_sus01 ] _ m & = & _ f where @xmath69 is the magnetization for each flavor . here",
    ", the magnetic field is considered to be significantly weak for which the spinors remain unaffected and only modification enters through the single particle energy . here , we consider one flavor quark matter and suppress the flavor indices .",
    "in presence of constant magnetic field @xmath6 , the magnetization depends on the difference of the number densities @xmath70 , where [ nodensity ] n_ps=[1+exp  ( _ ps -- g_d(p)_qsb)]^-1 . in the last equation , @xmath71 denotes the dirac magnetic moment and @xmath72 is the gyromagnetic ratio .",

    "the expression of @xmath9 may be compared with the one presented in @xcite to see the difference between the unpolarized and polarized matter .",
