    "the phase diagram of la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 shows different ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases as well as insulating and metallic phases @xcite and huge magnetoresistive effects have been discovered in thin films of manganites @xcite near doping levels @xmath5 , where the ferromagnetic curie temperature and conductivity are highest .",
    "we investigated the film growth and magnetotransport properties of thin films with doping levels @xmath6 .",
    "the thin films were laserablated onto mgo substrates . due to the rather large lattice mismatch",
    "the films will show a high number of defects at the substrate film interface and epitaxial strain is released at the early stages of film growth .",
    "thus for our 270 nm thick films the doping effects should not be obscured by lattice strain . in x - ray diffraction only ( 00@xmath7 ) reflections could be observed for films with doping levels @xmath8 . for higher @xmath9",
    "additionally a competing ( @xmath10 ) oriented growth was visible .",
    "the rocking curve widths @xmath11 were in the range @xmath12 .",
    "the systematic decrease of the lattice constants with doping shown in fig .  1 indicates a stoichiometric transfer from the target to the film .",
    "the values for the undoped compounds are taken from literature @xcite .",
    "scanning electron microscopy and scanning force microscopy showed for @xmath13 island growth while for higher doping rectangular platelike structures were seen .",
    "measurements of the temperature dependence of the spontaneous magnetisation in a magnetic field of 50 mt with a squid magnetometer , showed that the ferromagnetic metallic region of the phase diagram in the film coincides with that of bulk material @xcite .",
    "the low temperature values normalized per formula unit ( f.u . )",
    "are displayed in fig .  1 .",
    "above @xmath14 the vanishing magnetic hysteresis is in agreement with an antiferromagnetic insulating state .",
    "however , the sample with @xmath15 shows again a ferromagnetic hysteresis loop .    the low temperature coefficient of the resistivity is positive only for films with @xmath16 as is shown in fig .",
    "the curie temperature samples in this regime showed polaronic conduction @xcite .",
    "outside this doping range the temperature coefficient is always negative . for clarity we plotted in fig",
    ".  2 only a selection of the curves revealing the metal - insulator transition in this doped films .",
    "the metallic samples have beeen measured by a standard four point technique .",
    "the huge changes in resistance for films outside the metallic regime required the use of an electrometer circuit for measurements above 100 m@xmath17 .",
    "leakage currents were minimised by use of guarded teflon insulated triaxial cables allowing measurements up to 10 t@xmath17 .",
    "a pronounced negative magnetoresistance was observed for all the insulating samples below the magnetic phase transition temperaures with @xmath18 .",
    "however , the transport mechanism is different for low ( @xmath19 ) and high ( @xmath20 ) doped samples . on the low doped ferromagnetic side of the phase diagram a variable range hopping ( vrh ) transport describes the measured data well as is obvious from fig .",
    "application of a magnetic field increases the hopping probability without qualitatively changing the temperature dependence @xmath21 .",
    "this is different for the ca - rich samples where a vrh like transport can not be identified .",
