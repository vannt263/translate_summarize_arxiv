    "the pion form factor is a convenient way to study the transition from perturbative to nonperturbative qcd .",
    "this transition is typically expected to occur at a smaller @xmath0 than for the nucleon , and should thus be more easily attainable in experiments and in lattice studies .",
    "also , the asymptotic normalization of the pion form factor is known in terms of @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , lattice simulations of the pion form factor benefit from the complete absence of `` disconnected '' quark diagrams.@xcite    some experimental data already exist , another experiment is in progress right now at jefferson lab , and measurements at higher @xmath0 are planned for the future.@xcite .",
    "pioneering lattice qcd studies were carried out in the 1980s@xcite , and only recently has the pion form factor been revisited using lattice methods.@xcite in light of the substantial experimental effort , it is important to produce lattice qcd results with significantly smaller quark masses than have yet been employed , and eventually to attain larger values of @xmath0 .",
    "unquenched simulations will also be important . here",
    ", after a general discussion of correlation functions , the issue of smaller quark masses will be addressed using quenched wilson data .",
    "the electromagnetic form factor is obtained in lattice qcd simulations by placing a charged pion creation operator at euclidean time @xmath2 ,        a charged pion annihilation operator at @xmath3 , and a vector current insertion at @xmath4 as shown in fig .",
    "[ threepoint ] .",
    "a standard determination of 12 columns in the inverse of the quark matrix provides the two propagators that originate from @xmath2 .",
    "the remaining propagator is obtained for any particular annihilation operator , having definite momentum @xmath5 , by a two step procedure : the propagator from @xmath2 to @xmath3 is multiplied by the annihilation operator and that product is used as the input for a second 12-column linear algebra step .",
    "this determines the entire thick quark line of fig .",
    "[ threepoint ] .",
    "the momenta at the source ( @xmath6 ) and at the insertion ( @xmath7 ) can then be varied freely without computing new propagators . since the largest @xmath0 is attained in the breit frame ( @xmath8 ) , the simple choice of @xmath9 is not always desirable .",
    "the form factor , @xmath10 , is defined by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the chosen vector current .",
    "@xmath10 can be extracted from ratios of lattice correlation functions .",
    "the three - point correlator is @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote either `` local '' or `` smeared '' . inserting complete sets of hadron states and requiring @xmath16 , gives @xmath17 similarly for the two - point correlator , @xmath18 finally , consider operators that are temporally local , but spatially smeared democratically among the three spatial axes : @xmath19 from this discussion , it is found that the following expression for the form factor is independent of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and all time exponentials : @xmath22 where the indices @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be either @xmath26 ( local ) or @xmath27 ( smeared ) . for a conserved current , @xmath28 .",
    "our initial explorations have used the ( quenched ) wilson action with @xmath29 , so @xmath30 fm .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used except for the quark temporal boundaries , which are dirichlet .",
    "hopping parameters and lattice sizes are shown in table  [ masstable ] ; the resulting pseudoscalar and vector meson masses are also listed .",
    "notice that the smallest pion mass is less than 300 mev , and therefore significantly below those used in previous studies of the pion form factor .",
    "the pion operators are fixed at @xmath31 and @xmath32 except for the @xmath33 lattices , where @xmath34 . the standard point - split",
    "conserved vector current is used .",
    "a gauge - covariant gaussian smearing is employed at the source , @xmath35 the various results shown here are based on the analysis of between 80 and 155 configurations .",
    ".the chosen hopping parameters and numbers of lattice sites , along with the computed pseudoscalar and vector meson masses . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "representative plots of the data are shown in fig .",
    "[ plateaus ] . for each of the smaller hopping parameters",
    ", there is a reasonable plateau at timesteps sufficiently far from the pion operators ( timesteps 0 and 14 ) . for @xmath36 and 0.1566 , the possible plateau spans only a few timesteps .",
    "correlated fits to the data have produced fig .",
    "[ finalplot ] which shows the form factor as a function of @xmath0 for each available @xmath37 . for comparison ,",
    "the monopole curve @xmath38 is also shown where @xmath39 denotes the physical @xmath40 meson mass .",
    "notice that the experimental measurements from ref .",
    "@xcite lie on the monopole curve . for each @xmath37",
    "the lattice results also display a monopole form , and @xmath10 is found to decrease with decreasing quark mass as expected since the effective vector meson mass of the monopole form also shrinks with decreasing quark mass .",
