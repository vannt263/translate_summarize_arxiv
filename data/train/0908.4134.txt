    "after the seminal discovery of the characteristic quantum hall effect ( qhe ) in graphene @xcite , attention has been focused on the effect of disorder @xcite .",
    "randomness , which is important in the qhe in ordinary 2deg , is particularly crucial since it affects such key factors in the lattice ( as opposed to dirac field ) models of graphene such as the _ chiral _ ( a - b sub - lattice ) symmetry@xcite , and the scattering between the valleys ( k and k ) .",
    "note that the valley degeneracy has a topological origin as the doubling of the massless dirac fermions on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "it is then natural that the nature of disorder crucially affects the electronic structure .",
    "a potential disorder ( including random site energies ) destroys the chiral symmetry , whereas a disorder in bonds respects the symmetry , while the spatial correlation in the disorder controls the inter - valley scattering . in order to explore these , here we adopt the honeycomb lattice rather than the effective dirac model to investigate how the spatial correlation of disorder affects the landau level structure , especially the stability of the @xmath0 landau level which is essential to the characteristic qhe in graphene .    in the case of a potential disorder with degraded chiral symmetry",
    ", the quantum hall transition at the @xmath0 landau level has been shown to be robust in an effective dirac model @xcite .",
    "in such a model , however , the criticality of the transition at @xmath0 is described by the ordinary quantum hall transition , with nothing special about the criticality at the @xmath0 transition . in the previous paper @xcite",
    ", we have shown that for the bond disorder , which preserves the chiral symmetry , the criticality at @xmath0 transition is anomalously sensitive to the spatial correlation of disorder .",
    "as soon as the correlation length of the bond disorder exceeds few lattice constants of the honeycomb lattice , the @xmath0 landau level becomes anomalously sharp and the associated hall transition exhibits the anomalous criticality , which corresponds to a fixed point of the dirac fermion with chiral symmetry @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we present another example to reinforce our arguments that the anomalous hall transition is a general property of the chiral - symmetric random systems .",
    "namely , we consider systems with random phases in the transfer integrals , which corresponding to the case of random magnetic fields piercing the hexagons in honeycomb lattice .",
    "the tight - binding model for the honeycomb lattice is described by the hamiltonian @xmath1 , where the transfer integral @xmath2 is real while the peierls phases @xmath3 satisfy the requirement that the sum of the phases around a hexagon is equal to the magnetic flux piercing a hexagon in units of the flux quantum @xmath4 .",
    "random bonds are introduced as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the uniform and the random components , respectively .",
    "the random components @xmath7 are assumed to have a gaussian distribution , @xmath8 , with a variance @xmath9 and a spatial correlation , @xmath10 with a correlation length @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the position of the bond @xmath13 and @xmath14 the ensemble average .    on the other hand , random magnetic fields are introduced as @xmath15 .",
    "this type of disorder , being another disorder in bonds , also preserves the chiral symmetry . here",
    "@xmath16 represents the uniform part of the magnetic field , while @xmath17 the random magnetic fluxes for hexagons each located at position @xmath18 .",
    "we assume that the random component @xmath19 obeys a gaussian distribution with a variance @xmath20 and a spatial correlation @xmath21 with a correlation length @xmath22@xcite . in the following ,",
    "all lengths are measured in units of the bond length @xmath23 of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "let us recapitulate how these types of disorder preserve the chiral symmetry ( even for each realization of disorder ) .",
    "there exists a local unitary operator @xmath24 that anti - commutes with the hamiltonian , @xmath25 , which defines the chiral symmetry , and @xmath26 . in the case of the honeycomb lattice",
    ", the lattice sites can be decomposed into @xmath27 and @xmath28 sublattices .",
    "the operator @xmath24 can then be given as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 denotes the summation over the a sublattice sites . with this choice of @xmath24",
    "we can readily verify that the fermion operator @xmath31 is transformed as @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath34 for @xmath35 . due to this chiral symmetry",
    ", the energy levels always appear in pairs @xmath36 even in the presence of disorder .",
    "for instance , if we have an energy eigenstate @xmath37 satisfying @xmath38 , the state @xmath39 is an eigenstate with energy @xmath40 since @xmath41 .",
    "a special situation arises for zero - energy states , for which the eigenstates @xmath42 and @xmath43 are degenerated .",
    "the eigenstates can then be made simultaneous eigenstates @xmath44 of the operator @xmath24 with @xmath45 .",
    "the eigenstate @xmath46 has non - zero amplitudes only on the @xmath47 sublattice .",
    "the fact that the zero - energy states can be an eigenstate of @xmath24 implies that the zero - energy states has an extra symmetry , so that the criticality at zero energy can be especially sensitive to the presence or otherwise of the chiral symmetry @xcite . obviously , the potential disorder breaks this symmetry .",
    "the density of states @xmath48 is evaluated by the green function @xcite @xmath49 , where @xmath50 stands for the total number of sites and @xmath51 an infinitesimal imaginary part of energy for evaluating the green function numerically .",
    "we have carried out calculations for values of @xmath52 reduced from @xmath53 down to @xmath54 to confirm that the anomaly in the density of states at the @xmath0 landau level discussed below is not affected by the value of @xmath51 .",
    "the system size considered is a @xmath55 rectangular system with periodic boundaries in @xmath56 direction , where @xmath57 axis is assumed to be parallel to the zigzag direction of the honeycomb lattice . in actual calculations ,",
    "the landau gauge for the corresponding bricklayer lattice @xcite is adopted .",
    "first , we consider the random bonds in a uniform magnetic field ( @xmath58 ) . in the previous paper @xcite ,",
    "we have clearly demonstrated for such a model that when the correlation length @xmath11 exceeds few bond lengths , the @xmath0 landau level becomes anomalously sharp and the associated quantum hall transition shows an almost exact fixed - point - like criticality even in a finite system ( fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] ) .",
    "this sharply contrasts with the result for the uncorrelated case @xmath59 , for which the @xmath0 landau level is broadened in the same way as @xmath60 landau levels .",
    "the anomalous sensitivity to the correlation of disorder occurs only for the @xmath0 landau level .",
    "we have examined the density of states for other values of @xmath9 and @xmath16 , and confirmed that the anomaly at the @xmath0 landau level is commonly observed for @xmath61 . here",
    "we show the density of states as a function of the fermi energy and the correlation length @xmath11 for @xmath62 and @xmath63 in fig .",
    "it is again clearly seen , as has been seen in the case of @xmath64 @xcite , that the @xmath0 landau level becomes anomalously sharp compared to other landau levels as soon as the correlation length @xmath11 is greater than the lattice constant .    in actual graphene samples ,",
    "the scale of ripples is estimated to be of order of @xmath65 nanometers @xcite , which is much greater than the lattice constant @xmath66 @xcite , and the magnitude of disorder is likely to be much smaller .",
    "our result therefore clearly indicates that the bond disorder induced by ripples should not broaden the @xmath0 landau level .",
    "( the hall conductivity ( @xmath67 ) ) as a function of the fermi energy ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "the chern number for each realization of disorder is evaluated by using the lattice gauge technique@xcite .",
    "the results for the correlation length @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 are shown for plateaus @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 with the disorder strength @xmath77 , the magnetic field @xmath63 , and an average over 300 samples for the system size @xmath78 . ]     of the random bonds .",
    "the system - size is @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "the imaginary part of energy @xmath81 . ]",
    "let us next show the results for another model , namely the random magnetic field model with @xmath82 , where no randomness is assumed for the amplitude of the transfer energies ( @xmath83 ) . for this model , we consider both the small random field case , @xmath84 ( case 1 ) , and the large random field case , @xmath85 ( case 2 ) .",
    "for @xmath86 the distinct landau level structure is present ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath0 landau level is again anomalously sensitive to the spatial correlation of random magnetic fields : when the correlation length @xmath22 exceeds few lattice constants , the width of the @xmath0 landau level becomes a sharp , delta - function - like peak .",
    "indeed , the shape of the @xmath0 landau level for @xmath87 is almost exactly given by the lorentzian distribution @xmath88 , indicative of a zero intrinsic width .",
    "this again contrasts with the @xmath60 landau level .    for @xmath89 ( case 2 ) , on the other hand , the landau level structure is mostly washed out for @xmath60 landau levels , which is not surprising since the fluctuation of the magnetic field is larger than its mean value .",
    "surprisingly , @xmath0 landau level exhibits an anomalous behavior , where the delta - function - like behavior arises when the correlation length of the random magnetic field exceed few lattice constants , even though the field fluctuation width is much greater than the average field ( fig.[fig3 ] ) .     when the fluctuation of the magnetic field is smaller than its mean ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "the parameters are @xmath90 for a system size @xmath79 , @xmath91 and the imaginary part of energy @xmath81 . ]    ) .",
    "the parameters are @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) for a system size @xmath79 , @xmath91 and the imaginary part of energy @xmath94 . ]",
    "in order to check that the above anomalies are a consequence of the preserved chiral symmetry , we have also evaluated the density of states for the case of the spatially correlated potential disorder , where the hamiltonian is given by @xmath95 , where random site energies @xmath96 are assumed to obey a gaussian distribution with a variance @xmath97 and a spatial correlation @xmath98 .",
    "the result for @xmath99 and @xmath100 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] confirms that no anomaly exists at the @xmath0 landau level .",
    "as we increase the correlation length @xmath101 keeping the magnitude of disorder @xmath97 fixed , all the landau levels are broadened @xcite .      to summarize",
    ", we have investigated the anomalous behavior of the @xmath0 landau level of the qhe system on a honeycomb lattice .",
    "two types of bond disorder that preserve the chiral symmetry have been considered , namely the randomness in the magnitude of the transfer integrals ( random bonds ) and that in their phases ( random magnetic fields ) .",
    "it is clearly demonstrated that in both cases the @xmath0 landau level is anomalously sensitive to the spatial correlation of disorder , where an anomaly at the @xmath0 landau level appears as soon as the correlation length exceeds few bond lengths .",
    "this indicates that the absence of the mixing between two valleys are essential to the anomaly at the @xmath0 landau level .",
    "we have also confirmed that the anomaly does not exist for the correlated potential disorder , where the chiral symmetry is broken .",
    "the results suggest that the anomaly at the @xmath0 landau level is generic to the graphene system with long - range disorders that preserve the chiral symmetry .",
    "this implies that the bond disorder induced by ripples in graphene should not broaden the @xmath0 landau level ; conversely , if a broadening is observed in experiments , that must be caused by other origins , such as the potential disorder from charged impurities in substrates .",
    "experimentally , a narrower @xmath0 landau level of grephene has been reported by measuring the activation energy gaps @xcite , which may be related to the present analysis .",
    "more elaborate analysis on the nature of the disorder is an interesting future problem .",
