    "recently , it has been claimed in a series of articles  @xcite that the cosmic dark energy component could be explained naturally by the trans - planckian energy of a scalar field with a suitable non - linear dispersion relation in the trans - planckian regime .",
    "such dispersion relations , which relate the frequency @xmath4 to the wave - number @xmath5 of a scalar field wave - packet , and which depart from the standard linear dispersion relation in the trans - planckian regime are a way of modeling phenomenologically the unknown physics for sub - planckian wavelengths .",
    "they have been used extensively in the recent literature in the context of black - hole physics  @xcite and of the inflationary trans - planckian problem  @xcite .    in the particular case considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , the dispersion relation departs from its standard linear form and approach a decreasing exponential at large wave - numbers .",
    "this type of dispersion relation could possibly emerge from string theory  @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that the energy density of the modes of sub - planckian wavelengths and sub - hubble frequencies ( referred to as `` tail '' modes ) is naturally of the same order as the critical energy density today and has the same equation of state as a cosmological constant .",
    "hence , it could account without fine - tuning for the dark energy .",
    "the energy density contained in the tail today has been calculated in ref .",

    "the equation of state of the tail modes has been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite and its cosmological evolution has been solved to argue that the cosmic coincidence problem ( why does the dark energy dominate now ? ) is solved .    in this paper",
    "we argue that this model does not and can not work for several reasons .",
    "we first argue that the energy density and equation of state of the `` tail '' modes depend directly on the choice of initial data for the scalar field , and that this latter can not be specified _ unambiguously _ since there is no preferred initial vacuum state ( section  [ sec : ii ] ) .",
    "this implies that any cosmological consequence derived depends directly on the ad - hoc choice of initial data ( initial quantum state ) .",
    "we then show that the violation of the wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( wkb ) approximation in the remote past for all co - moving wave - numbers , which is inevitable in the present scenario , implies the continuous production _ at all times _ of a large amount of quanta with physical wave - number @xmath2 ( section  [ sec : iii ] ) .",
    "this finding is in agreement with general arguments given by starobinsky  @xcite ( this latter work did not however study the present scenario ) .",
    "we evaluate the amount of energy density produced for modes of physical wave - number and frequency @xmath6 for various choices of initial data and conclude that it is generically of order @xmath7 .",
    "this process takes place at all times , and since the energy density produced is much larger than the background energy density , it implies that the semi - classical perturbative framework on which the model of refs .",
    "@xcite rests breaks down . in an earlier study , devoted to constructing an effective stress - energy tensor for theories with non - linear dispersion relations  @xcite",
    ", we already criticized this model by arguing that it led generically to the wrong equation of state .",
    "we revisit this issue further in section  [ sec : iv ] , where we prove that the effective energy - momentum tensor we derived earlier is well - behaved , thus disproving an improper claim of ref .",
    "@xcite and confirming our earlier criticisms .",
    "we provide a summary of our conclusions in section  [ sec : v ] .",
    "refs .  @xcite consider a scalar field , @xmath8 , with a non - linear dispersion relation that is linear in the sub - planckian regime and approaches a decreasing exponential at trans - planckian wave - numbers ( i.e. for @xmath9 , @xmath10 being a fundamental characteristic scale ) .",
    "this dispersion relation is shown in fig .",
    "this scalar field is assumed to describe the density ( scalar ) perturbations and/or the primordial gravitational waves .",
    "the `` tail '' modes are thus interpreted as a bath of gravitons of super - planckian wavelengths and sub - hubble frequencies .",
    "this scalar field is treated as a test - field ( its back - reaction on the background is neglected ) and is quantized on the curved cosmological background . assuming that the `` tail '' modes of this field are initially in a well chosen vacuum state as @xmath11 ( @xmath12 denoting conformal time ) ,",
    "the occupation number at late times ( @xmath13 ) of quanta extracted out of the vacuum by the dynamical background has been calculated in ref .",
    "this occupation number can then be used to calculate the energy density stored today in the `` tail '' .",
    "this is the thread of the calculation performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which we now follow in some detail",
    ". this discussion will take us to the two main arguments that we bring forward against this model ( given in this section and the following ) .",
    "_ vs _ @xmath5 .",
    "region i ( hashed area ) corresponds to the `` tail '' modes for which @xmath14 [ and @xmath15 .",
    "region ii corresponds to the sub - horizon modes ( @xmath16 ) that are outside of the tail , while region iii corresponds to the super - horizon modes @xmath17 .",
    "the fundamental scale @xmath18 is also indicated.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the equation of motion of a scalar field @xmath19 in a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) space - time with scale factor @xmath20 reads : @xmath21\\mu_k=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is a coupling parameter to gravity and a prime denotes differentiation with respect to conformal time .",
    "@xmath23 is the co - moving wave - number and @xmath24 is the co - moving frequency .",
    "@xmath25 for tensor perturbations degrees of freedom and @xmath26 for a conformally coupled field .",
    "the scale factor is taken to be a power law in conformal time , @xmath27 , and the following dispersion relation , parameterized by two parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 with @xmath30 in order to insure that the dispersion relation is linear for small wave - numbers , is introduced : @xmath31,\\ ] ] with @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "a problem with this dispersion relation is that it depends on the power - law index @xmath34 of the scale factor .",
    "if taken literally , this means that the dispersion relation , or the physical frequency of a given mode , changes as the scale factor power - law index @xmath34 changes between various cosmological eras ( e.g. inflation / radiation domination / matter domination ) .",
    "more importantly one easily sees that the above dispersion relation has a pathological behavior in the radiation ( @xmath35 ) or matter ( @xmath36 ) dominated eras .",
    "in fact , for @xmath37 , it implies @xmath38 as @xmath39 , whereas one should instead reach the linear dispersion relation in that regime with @xmath40 . since ref .",
    "@xcite focused on the case of de sitter space - time with @xmath41 , we set @xmath41 in the above dispersion relation , i.e. , the above @xmath42 should be understood as @xmath43 .",
    "this reformulated dispersion relation thus coincides with that used in ref .",
    "@xcite for de sitter space .",
    "however , in the matter dominated era , for instance , we have @xmath44 and the general class of solutions to the field equation obtained in ref",
    ".  @xcite does not hold anymore .",
    "the linear dependence of @xmath42 on @xmath12 is lost for background metrics other than de sitter , but the linear dependence of @xmath4 on @xmath5 is preserved in the small @xmath5 limit for all metrics , which is obviously an imperative .",
    "the field equation can finally be rewritten as : @xmath45 -(1 - 6\\xi ) \\frac{\\beta(\\beta+1)}{\\eta ^2}\\biggr\\}\\mu _ k=0\\ , , \\ ] ] with , again , @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "the solution to this equation depends on the value of @xmath22 and @xmath34 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the contribution of the @xmath47 $ ] term is assumed to be negligible at early times .",
    "however the above equation shows that this is not the case ; denoting by @xmath48 the term in curly brackets in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) , one has @xmath49 as @xmath50 and the term @xmath51 is always dominant in that limit if @xmath52 ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) .",
    "therefore , in the limit @xmath52 and @xmath11 the two independent solutions to the field equation are power - laws in @xmath12 : @xmath55 this is an important point as it implies that the mode function does not behave as a plane wave in the limit @xmath11 when @xmath52 .",
    "the solution to the field equation in this limit is reminiscent of the mode freezing in inflationary theories for fields with linear dispersion relations and @xmath25 when the mode exits the horizon .",
    "it is also argued that the term in @xmath56 can be absorbed at late times in a redefinition of the dispersion relation .",
    "however this can not be correct since by construction , the dispersion relation @xmath57 depends only on @xmath5 , i.e. time only enters via @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , one can absorb a term @xmath58 into @xmath59 only if @xmath41 ( de sitter space - time ) , as inspection of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) reveals . in effect , the curly bracket of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) can then be rewritten as @xmath60 times a function of @xmath61 .",
    "but , in that particular case , the redefined modified dispersion relation does not have an exponential shape anymore , since @xmath4 approaches a constant ( @xmath62 ) as @xmath63 .",
    "however , this should not give the impression that the corresponding solution is a plane wave since , evidently , the co - moving frequency @xmath64 which enters eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) still behaves as @xmath65 .",
    "moreover in the case of a matter or radiation dominated cosmology , one can not absorb the scale factor term in the dispersion relation .",
    "nevertheless one can also assume @xmath66 .",
    "in that case , it is possible to find an exact solution to the equation of motion in de sitter space - time .",
    "indeed , for a conformally coupled field , the term @xmath56 disappears from the field equation and the equation becomes simpler .",
    "note however that the scalar field can not correspond to tensor perturbations degrees of freedom since these are minimally coupled to the metric .",
    "let us consider @xmath26 for the moment .",
    "a solution to the field equation , given in ref .",
    "@xcite reads :    @xmath67    where @xmath68 is an hypergeometric function and @xmath69 and @xmath70 are expressed in terms of @xmath28 and @xmath29 as :    @xmath71    this solution is valid only for de sitter space - time with @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) . as already mentioned , this is due to the fact that , with the reformulated dispersion introduced above , the linear dependence of @xmath42 in the conformal time is lost for other scale factors .",
    "however similar solutions for other metrics can be obtained if the dispersion relation is tuned to the power - law evolution of the scale factor , i.e. if the parameter @xmath42 remains linear in @xmath12 ( possibly at the expense of linearity of @xmath4 in the small @xmath5 limit , see above ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eq:2 ] ) has in fact two independent solutions ( see below ) and the choice  ( [ eq:4 ] ) represents only one branch of the solution , which is moreover written on the branch cut of the hypergeometric function @xmath68 . at early times ( @xmath54 , i.e. @xmath74 ) , this solution ( [ eq:4 ] ) does not oscillate and it blows up is singular at @xmath75 .",
    "one can also solve eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) for @xmath66 and @xmath41 in the limit @xmath50 . in this case",

    "it is more convenient to write the general solution to the field equation , with @xmath26 , as @xmath85 , where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are two independent solutions given by :    @xmath88    since @xmath69 is pure imaginary , and @xmath70 is real , one concludes easily that @xmath89 .",
    "the wronskian of these two solutions is non - zero , and can be used to relate the coefficients @xmath90 and @xmath91 so as to obtain canonical commutation relations for the field operator and its adjoint . since only one branch of the solution was given in ref .",
    "@xcite , the canonical commutation relations for the field and its adjoint could not be satisfied .",
    "more precisely , it can be checked that the solution given in eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) is real .",
    "this is due to the fact that it involves an hypergeometric function of the form @xmath92 with @xmath93 and @xmath94 in that case and @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , one has @xmath96 and the mode function is indeed real .",
    "it follows that the wronskian of the solution considered in ref .",
    "@xcite vanishes : @xmath97 . using the properties of hypergeometric functions",
    ", one can check that both independent solutions @xmath86 and @xmath87 behave as @xmath98 in the limit @xmath54 , i.e. these mode functions blow up .",
    "this result is consistent with eq .",
    "( [ footeq ] ) since , in the tail , the two branches @xmath86 and @xmath87 are linear combinations of the bessel functions @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , we have shown that neither in the case @xmath99 nor in the case @xmath66 does the mode function behave as a plane wave in the tail .",
    "thus the initial state of the field can not reduce to the bunch - davies adiabatic vacuum , contrary to the claim  @xcite : `` _ we show that there is no ambiguity in the correct choice of the initial vacuum state .",
    "the only initial vacuum is the adiabatic vacuum obtained by the solution to the mode equation _ '' .",
    "the usual prescription to remove the ambiguity on the choice of vacuum state in curved space - time , i.e. for constructing a vacuum state which is closest to the definition of vacuum in minkowski , is indeed to rely on the wkb approximation to construct vacua of successively higher adiabatic order  @xcite . in this scenario",
    "@xcite , this construction can not be performed for a simple reason : the wkb approximation , which quantifies the adiabaticity of the quantum mode evolution is violated at all times for modes contained in the tail , i.e. modes with @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the wkb condition can be written in the form @xmath102",
    "@xcite , where @xmath48 denotes the term in curly brackets in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) as before , and @xmath103 . in effect",
    "the wkb solution @xmath104 exactly verifies the following equation @xmath105 . therefore it is a good approximation to the solution of the actual mode equation @xmath106 if the above inequality @xmath102 is satisfied ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "the expression for @xmath107 is cumbersome , but since we are interested in the regime @xmath108 , we may use the limiting form of the dispersion relation :    @xmath109    if @xmath26 , then @xmath110 and @xmath111 . in order to understand the behavior of @xmath112 ,",
    "it is convenient to introduce the physical wave - number @xmath113 such that @xmath114 [ in the case @xmath25 , one has @xmath115 .",
    "this wavenumber @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the physical wavenumber that gives the lower limit of the tail , as indicated in fig .",

    "the meaning of the physical wave - number @xmath120 is the following ( see fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] ) . if @xmath121 but @xmath122 ( i.e. , within region ii ) , the mode is outside of the tail with @xmath123 . if however @xmath124 , the mode is in the tail with @xmath125 ( region i of fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] ) .",
    "then @xmath124 means that @xmath126 which implies in turn @xmath127 , hence the wkb approximation is violated at all times in the tail .",

[ fig0 ] ) , the dominant term is @xmath130 in the expression of @xmath131 , namely @xmath132 , hence @xmath133^{-1}$ ] , which for @xmath41 ( de sitter ) and @xmath134 ( minimal coupling ) reduces to @xmath135 . in this case",
    ", it can be shown that the wkb approximation does not give the right behavior for the mode function even though @xmath136 is smaller than unity  @xcite , and that the wkb approximation is not valid either .",
    "again , note that outside of the tail ( region ii of fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] ) the wkb approximation is valid .",
    "the calculation is the same as in the previous paragraph , since for @xmath121 and @xmath108 , one has @xmath137 since @xmath123 .",
    "thus one finds @xmath138 outside the tail even for @xmath139 .    to summarize this discussion the wkb condition",
    "is violated by the present dispersion relation in the tail ( region i in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] ) at all times and an initial vacuum state can not be constructed unambiguously . outside of the tail ( region ii of fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] ) , for @xmath123 or @xmath121 , the wkb approximation is a good approximation .",
    "one can also verify that the construction of an initial vacuum state by minimization of the energy content does not work in this case , see ref .",
    "this point is one major obstacle to the scenario proposed in ref .",
    "since there is no preferred initial vacuum state , all cosmological conclusions drawn depend directly on the particular choice of the initial state , hence on the choice of initial data . at the very best",
    ", one has to fine - tune the initial conditions to obtain a given amount of energy in a given part of the spectrum .",
    "the standard calculation of the amount of energy contained at late times in a given co - moving wave - number mode is done by decomposing the solution at late times ( outside the tail ) in terms of positive and negative frequency plane waves , as    @xmath140    the squared modulus of the bogoliubov coefficient @xmath141 then will give the occupation number of quanta produced in the mode of co - moving wave - number @xmath142 .",
    "note that , in principle , the coefficients @xmath143 and @xmath141 can be slowly varying functions of time , and the above expression implicitly involves a wkb approximation to first order in which the time evolution of @xmath143 and @xmath141 is neglected .",
    "the corresponding vacuum is an adiabatic vacuum to first order .    in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath141 is calculated in the limit @xmath144 as @xmath145 .",
    "however the limit @xmath13 does not hold in an inflationary universe with @xmath146 and @xmath53 since @xmath147 is singular as @xmath148 .",
    "one needs to match the background evolution to a decelerated universe as @xmath149 . in effect , if one wishes to calculate the contribution of the tail modes to the energy density _ today _ , it is necessary to calculate the evolution of the modes from the inflationary era up to today .",
    "note that the dynamical evolution of the tail modes depends _ a priori _ strongly on the background scale factor dynamics .",
    "this calculation could not be performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , since the solution given in terms of the hypergeometric function is not valid at late times in the radiation dominated or matter dominated eras unless the parameter @xmath42 of the dispersion relation is tuned to the evolution of the scale factor , but the dispersion relation would become pathological as we saw before for @xmath150 with @xmath37 . furthermore , as explained above , the solution to the field equation given in ref .",
    "@xcite [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) ] describes only one branch of the solution . finally , one can not compute @xmath141 for modes still contained in the `` tail '' at late times by matching the solution to plane waves as done in ref .",
    "@xcite since for those modes , the wkb approximation is never valid so that the out solution can not be decomposed in a sum of plane waves .",
    "thus the calculation of the bogoliubov coefficient @xmath141 performed in ref .",
    "@xcite can not apply to modes contained in the `` tail '' today .",
    "in this section we calculate the amount of energy density created in quanta that redshift out of the `` tail '' , and show that it leads to a severe back - reaction problem . in ref .",
    "@xcitethe energy density contained in the tail is calculated as @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the physical wave - number such that @xmath153 today .",
    "this expression for @xmath154 is ill - defined due to the double integration element @xmath155 in the absence of a dirac function on the mass shell . the total energy density @xmath156 is defined analogously but the lower bound is extended to @xmath157 .",
    "then , it is argued that @xmath158 during inflation . note that if @xmath159 and @xmath154 is constant ( corresponding to a acuum - like equation of state as suggested ) in order to account for the dark energy then the above statement yields @xmath160 .",
    "if this holds during inflation , one faces a severe back - reaction problem since the background energy density during inflation is @xmath161 orders of magnitude below @xmath162 , and the overall calculation framework ( a test quantum scalar field on a classical background ) breaks down .",
    "as we argue in this section , it is actually a generic prediction of this model that @xmath163 _ at all times_. this result @xmath163 is in agreement with a recent work by starobinsky  @xcite , which showed that models with dispersion relations such that the wkb approximation is not valid in the far past when the physical wave - number @xmath164 implies a very substantial amount of particle production .    in the following",
    "we calculate the amount of energy density stored in modes with physical wave - number @xmath165 .",
    "the calculation follows the line of thought indicated in the previous section . since in the range",
    "@xmath166 the wkb approximation is valid , one can decompose the solution to the field equation in terms of plane waves as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : planew ] ) when modes enter this regime . as long as @xmath138 one can neglect the time evolution of @xmath141 , and it is natural to interpret @xmath167 as the occupation number of particles in mode @xmath142 . as argued earlier this decomposition in plane waves can not be made for modes that are still contained in the tail .",
    "one can then calculate the amount of energy density @xmath168 stored in the log interval around the physical wave - number @xmath5 and the corresponding fractional density parameter @xmath169 in units of the background energy density :    @xmath170    using @xmath171 .",
    "the fractional density parameter must be smaller than unity _ at all times _ and _ for all physical wave - numbers _ , otherwise back - reaction is significant and all semi - classical first order calculations are unreliable . in the following",
    "we calculate this quantity @xmath172 for a physical wave - number @xmath173 , i.e. , once the wavelength becomes larger than the fundamental scale . it can be expressed _ via _",
    "@xmath141 in terms of the constants that parametrize the choice of initial data .",
    "our goal here is to study the dependence of the amount of energy density created in modes of physical momenta @xmath6 on the initial data , for which there is no definite prescription as we argued in the previous section .      in the case of conformal coupling @xmath26",
    "there exists an exact solution to the field equation written in terms of the two independent solutions @xmath86 and @xmath87 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mu1mu2 ] ) .",
    "one can then calculate the bogoliubov coefficient deep in the region where the wkb approximation is valid , for instance around @xmath174 by decomposing this exact solution in plane waves .",
    "however the coefficients of the hypergeometric function in term of which the exact solution hence @xmath141 are written are of order @xmath175 . for values of these coefficients that are relevant for our cosmological applications ( i.e. @xmath176 during inflation ) ,",
    "the numerical calculation of the hypergeometric function turns out to be too involved and we have been unable to calculate @xmath141 in a reasonable amount of time for @xmath177 . therefore we take a different approach and approximate the exact solution in the tail @xmath178 by the solution derived in terms of bessel functions in eq .  ( [ footeq ] ) , and that in the region @xmath179 by the plane wave solution .",
    "the bogoliubov coefficient @xmath141 of the plane wave solution is obtained by matching the two solutions and their first derivatives at the transition point @xmath180 .",

    "the energy - momentum tensor derived by varying the action with respect to the metric is the sum of the energy - momentum tensor of the scalar field and that of @xmath362 .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to flrw space - times by choosing @xmath363 .",
    "this approach is consistent as @xmath362 satisfies its field equation [ see eq .  (",
    "15 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ] , and the scalar field also satisfies its field equation . in frlw space - time , the energy - momentum tensor of the four - vector ( i.e. the part which depends only on @xmath362 ) vanishes since @xmath362 is constant  @xcite , hence the remainder is the scalar field energy - momentum tensor , which is conserved as shown above .",
    "we consider this scalar field as a test field , which we quantize on the curved background .",
    "the dynamics of the background can be specified by adding matter fields to the action without modifying our approach . indeed",
    "the matter field energy - momentum tensor will be separately conserved .",
    "therefore our earlier criticisms on the equation of state of the trans - planckian modes apply .",
    "we also note that a recent paper by frampton  @xcite argues that by adding higher order terms of the form @xmath364 in the effective lagrangian , one can obtain a correct equation of state , i.e. similar to that of vacuum . here",
    "@xmath365 denotes a three - dimensional laplacian expressed in a generally covariant way on space - like hyper - surfaces ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for explicit definitions ) .",
    "the choice @xmath363 then reduces this term to the usual three - dimensional laplacian on constant time hyper - surfaces for flrw space - times .",
    "however , as should be obvious , the only terms that can enter the energy - momentum tensor _ via _ this new term always contain derivatives of the form @xmath366 when @xmath367 .",
    "those terms vanish when one picks @xmath362 to be constant as above . for @xmath368 ,",
    "i.e. the lowest order term of the expansion , one can check that the variation of @xmath369 with respect to the metric or its first derivative always induces a term proportional to a derivative of @xmath362 that is either spatial or temporal .",
    "this calculation can be found in eqs .",
    "( b3 ) and ( b4 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ( the substitution @xmath370 in this calculation can be made without changing the result since the equation is written in a generally covariant way ) .",
    "therefore we conclude that the addition of terms proposed by frampton can not lead to any difference with respect to the energy - momentum tensor we proposed earlier .",
    "hence such terms can not account straightforwardly for a vacuum - like equation of state in this scenario .",
    "the difference with the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite probably lies in the choice of normalization of @xmath362 : ref .",
    "@xcite claims that , in a cosmological context , @xmath371 ( @xmath147 is the scale factor ) .",
    "however , @xmath372 is a scalar , while @xmath60 is the component of a rank two tensor so that this choice of normalization is manifestly not covariant . of course",
    ", it can be made covariant at the expense of the introduction of a second vector field but this does not seem to be the case in ref .",
    "this implies that the lagrangian proposed by frampton is generally not covariant .",
    "of course the correct normalization for @xmath362 in a cosmological context is always @xmath373 ( up to the sign convention ) , and @xmath362 can be written as @xmath374 if the frlw metric is written in terms of conformal time , or @xmath375 if the metric is written in terms of cosmic time .",
    "to finish , let us also note that it is claimed in ref .",
    "@xcite that `` _ the tail modes are still frozen at present ... thus the energy of the tail is a contribution to the dark energy of the universe : up to the present it has the equation of state of a cosmological constant term _ '' . here , that the tail modes are frozen means @xmath376 , the solution to the field equation when the term @xmath56 dominates ( for @xmath25 ) .",
    "but there is no logical relationship between these modes being frozen and the equation of state being that of a cosmological constant . as a matter of fact the equation of state of the modes of wavelengths larger than the horizon size for a scalar field with a linear dispersion relation takes the form @xmath377 .",
    "the derivation of the equation of state requires to define correctly a stress - energy tensor when such non - linear dispersion relations are taken into account ( and thus when lorentz invariance is broken ) as we did in ref .",
    "@xcite . note also that there is a contradiction between the above claim of ref .",
    "@xcite and the whole content of the recent paper by bastero - gil and mersini  @xcite which calculates the equation of state of the trans - planckian modes and finds that it is not the equation of state of the vacuum but that it approaches it only at late times .",
    "in this article , we have examined in detail the scenario proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite which attributes the dark energy to the properties of a scalar field with a dispersion relation that decreases exponentially with trans - planckian wave - number @xmath378 .",
    "we have demonstrated that this mechanism does not work , mainly for two reasons .",
    "( i ) the mode function of the scalar field does not behave as a plane wave as @xmath54 in the so - called `` tail '' ( i.e. , the part of the non - linear dispersion relation where @xmath125 and @xmath379 ) .",
    "this implies that there is no definite prescription for constructing a well - defined initial vacuum state , hence that the choice of initial data is entirely arbitrary .",
    "this situation is similar to the problem of setting initial data for cosmological perturbations in the absence of an accelerated expansion era ( but with linear dispersion relations ) , in which case the data would have to be specified on super - horizon scales where the mode function does not oscillate and is frozen by the expansion . in the scenario of refs .",
    "@xcite the wkb approximation is not valid at all times for modes in the tail .",
    "this explains that the notion of adiabatic vacuum can not be used to set up initial data and the initial state proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite is thus ad - hoc .",
    "it also brings us to the second objection against this scenario : ( ii ) since all modes originate in the tail of the dispersion relation , the breakdown of the wkb approximation for a given physical wave - number at early times implies the continuous production of a substantial number of quanta with physical wave - numbers @xmath380 .",
    "the breakdown of the wkb approximation can indeed be seen as the signal of a strongly non - adiabatic evolution which is generically associated with particle production in expanding space - times .",
    "we have calculated the amount of energy density produced in modes of physical wave - number @xmath18 as a function of the two parameters that characterize the ( arbitrary ) choice of initial data .",
    "we have shown that this energy density is generically of order @xmath7 .",
    "the production of energy density in quanta with wave - numbers @xmath6 in excess of the background energy density @xmath381 implies the breakdown of the perturbative semi - classical framework used for the calculation , and renders all claims irrelevant .",
    "there is a small region of parameter space in which this energy density can be tuned down to zero , but the fine - tuning in the choice of initial data is of order @xmath3 .",
    "such a fine - tuning at the time of inflation is of order @xmath382 and is probably acceptable , but today , it is of the same order as the celebrated fine - tuning of the cosmological constant problem ."
