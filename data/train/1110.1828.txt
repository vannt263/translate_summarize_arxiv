    "the `` cosmological principle '' derives from copernicus discovery that can be stated as follows : when the origin of coordinates is placed in the centre od the sun , the description of the motions of planets becomes simpler . in later centuries",
    "further discoveries indicated that the position of the sun in the universe is not in any way privileged .",
    "ultimately , this conclusion assumed a fundamentalist form : all positions in space are equivalent ; every observer will see the same large - scale image of the universe .",
    "this `` cosmological principle '' is not a summary of knowledge based on observations , but a postulate .",
    "just as all other hypotheses , it requires observational verification .",
    "progress in observing technology , with still farther regions coming into view , produced no justification for this principle : only more structures were becoming visible . nevertheless , we are told that the universe is homogeneous `` at a sufficiently large scale '' .",
    "the definition of this `` sufficient scale '' is far from precise ( `` a few '' hundred megaparsecs ) .",
    "this is the size of the `` fundamental cell '' of the universe , which should be repetitive  but it is so large that details of mass distribution at its edges and beyond are fuzzy .",
    "traditionally , structures are described by solutions of einstein s equations linearised around homogeneous models .",
    "this method has problems :    \\1 .",
    "it is impossible to determine the radius of convergence of a series of approximations when we know only the first and sometimes the second term  as is always the case in cosmology .",
    "\\2 . in practice ,",
    "one demands that the parameter of a perturbative calculation is smaller than 1 ( but this is not a sufficient condition ) . in cosmology",
    ", there are two such parameters : the density contrast @xmath0 and the curvature contrast @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the mass density in the background model , @xmath3 is the difference between the value of density at the location considered and @xmath2 , @xmath4 is the curvature of a 3-dimensional space of constant time in the background model , @xmath5 is the analogue of @xmath3 ) . _",
    "both _ must be small .",
    "the curvature contrast alone is not any measure of goodness of approximation @xcite .",
    "but @xmath6 is not fulfilled in most objects considered in cosmology :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     \\3 . among the solutions of the linearised einstein equations",
    "there are such that are not approximations to any exact solution @xcite .",
    "inhomogeneous models are not alternatives , but _",
    "generalisations _ that reduce to the traditional ones in the limit of spatial homogeneity .",
    "one should not expect that observations will tell us that one class is fine , and the other should be rejected .",
    "the relation is similar to that between a globe and a map of a region of the earth .",
    "a globe portrays the earth as a perfect sphere , but a map of a small area will show mountains and other features .",
    "the metric of this model follows from _ assumed symmetries of spacetime _ : @xmath7.\\ ] ] if the matter in the model has zero pressure , then @xmath8 obeys @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are arbitrary constants and @xmath12 is the cosmological constant .",
    "@xmath13 + @xmath13 + @xmath13 +    the _ redshift _ @xmath14 is defined by    @xmath15    for the r  w models the redshift is : @xmath16    the _ luminosity distance _ between an observer at @xmath17 and the source of light at @xmath18 is defined as the flat - space distance to a source that would give the same observed flux of radiation , corrected for the recession velocity of the source . in the r ",

    "tolman @xcite model is @xmath28 where @xmath29 obeys ( from the einstein equations ) :    @xmath30    the functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 are arbitrary .",
    "the integral of ( [ 3.10 ] ) contains one more arbitrary function , @xmath33  the `` timetable '' of the initial explosion .",
    "for example , when @xmath34 the solution of ( [ 3.10 ] ) is @xmath35 the r  w limit of l ",
    "t is @xmath36    the l ",
    "t model is spherically symmetric around one centre . it does not represent the whole universe , but a single structure embedded in an r  w background .",
    "w background can contain several l ",
    "t regions .",
    "the hypothesis of accelerated expansion of the universe arose from observations of type ia supernovae .",
    "such a supernova is the final stage of evolution of a white dwarf in a binary system .",
    "the maximal absolute luminosity of all supernovae of this class is assumed to be the same .    by measuring the redshift of these supernovae",
    ", one can calculate the distance to them , _ assuming that the universe we live in is r  w with known parameters , and so the hubble law is exactly fulfilled _  and then calculate the expected flux of radiation through a unit surface area to be observed on the earth .",
    "it turned out that the actually observed maximal flux is smaller than expected , as if the supernovae were farther from us than we thought . in order to explain this discrepancy , _ the previously used universe model had to be modified_. _ attempts to fit various r  w models to the observed luminosities _ led to the best fit achieved when @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "a positive value of @xmath40 means that the universe has to expand with acceleration .",
    "this gave rise to the puzzle of `` dark energy '' ( that would propel the acceleration ) and to research programs aimed at solving it . but is this the only possible explanation of the  dimming of supernovae \" ?",
    "the interpretation of observations is possible only when _ the background geometry of the space is pre - assumed_. the statements in italics in the text above indicate the points at which this prior assumption intervened .",
    "this last remark must be exactly understood because its mistaken understanding created a false legend . what we have to explain is the relation between the observed luminosity of the type ia supernovae and their redshifts , i.e. we have to reproduce the function @xmath41 in our model .",
    "_ the `` accelerated expansion '' of the universe is not an observed phenomenon , but an element of interpretation of observations , forced upon us by the r  w models . _",
    "if we can re - create the observed @xmath41 in a decelerating inhomogeneous model , then the `` accelerated expansion '' becomes an illusion .",
    "this can be achieved using the l ",
    "t model @xcite .",
    "we assume that the observer is at the symmetry centre and that @xmath42 const , ( the same @xmath43 as in the r  w model ) .",
    "for @xmath33 take the implicit definition : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the present value of the hubble coefficient .",
    "the trick is that @xmath14 and @xmath47 are taken from observations , but the definition of @xmath41 is no longer ( [ 3.5 ] ) .",
    "instead , @xmath48 is taken from an l ",
    "t model with @xmath49 , and this defines @xmath33 .",
    "equations for @xmath33 can now be solved numerically .",
    "comparison with ( [ 3.8 ] ) shows that ( [ 4.1 ] ) defines the same relation between @xmath50 and @xmath14 as in the `` standard '' r  w model with @xmath37 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "however , we achieved this with @xmath49 , i. e. with decelerated expansion  as dictated by the laws of gravitation that we all know .",
    "had we used the l ",
    "t model rather than r  w to interpret the observations , there would be no need for the `` dark energy '' and `` accelerated expansion '' .    using this l ",
    "t model one can explain the `` dimming of supernovae '' in an intuitively clear way . with a non - constant @xmath51 of suitable shape ( see fig .",
    "[ imitaccel ] ) , each l  t matter shell that intersects our past light cone is older by @xmath52 than a @xmath49 r  w shell that would intersect the light cone at the same point . therefore , at this intersection , the l ",
    "t shell expands slower than an r  w shell would do .",
    "the @xmath52 increases toward the past , and so does the difference between the expansion velocities . in this way",
    "t model imitates the acceleration of expansion relative to the @xmath53 r  w model .",
    "@xmath54 .",
    "generic light rays sent from the same source at different times to the same observer pass through different sequences of intermediate matter particles @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ nonrep ] ) . as a consequence",
    ", the observer should see distant objects drift across the sky .",
    "under most favourable conditions , the drift rate would be 10@xmath55 to 10@xmath56 arc second per year , but should be detectable after a few years of monitoring a given source , using devices that are already under construction .",
    "this drift does not exist in the r  w models .",
    "@xmath54    inhomogeneities in mass distribution in the path of light rays cause directional variations of temperature of the cmb radiation .",
    "several investigations @xcite showed that no variations larger than @xmath57 should be expected .",
    "this agrees with the measured values .",
    "thus , the high isotropy of the cmb radiation does not imply that we live in an r  w model ",
    "the interaction between mass inhomogeneities and light is simply very weak .",
    "@xmath54    as the universe evolves , the redshifts of astronomical objects change with time . for the @xmath12cdm model @xmath58 for @xmath59 . for the giant void models",
    "( see next section ) @xmath60 is expected for all @xmath14 .",
    "thus , a detection of a negative redshift drift for all @xmath14 would be a proof against dark energy .",
    "however , the converse is not true , as there are gpc - scale inhomogeneous models that also have @xmath58 for low @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "@xmath54    in every model that begins with a big bang ( r  w included ! ) the observed angular diameter of distant objects decreases with distance up to a certain location , and then increases as the observations approach the big bang . the position of the minimum puts constraints on a model @xcite and is a consistency check that may rule out some models .",
    "astrophysicists are unusually tolerant toward a loose approach to mathematics .",
    "papers written in such a style planted errors in the literature , which were then uncritically cited and came to be taken as established facts . in this section ,",
    "characteristic examples of misconceptions are presented ( marked by @xmath61 ) together with their explanations ( marked by * @xmath62 * ) .",
    "@xmath63 the l ",

    "`` weak singularity '' _ at the centre @xcite , where the scalar curvature @xmath64 has the property @xmath65 .    * @xmath62 * @xmath65 is not a singularity by any accepted criterion @xcite .",
    "it only implies a discontinuity in the gradient of mass density  a thing common in nature ( e.g. on the surface of the earth ) . at the centre",
    ", @xmath66 implies a conical profile of density  also a nonsingular configuration .",
    "@xmath63 decelerating inhomogeneous models with @xmath49 can not be fitted to the @xmath41 relation that implies acceleration in @xmath12cdm .",
    "this is because the following equation prohibits @xmath67 @xcite @xmath68 ( @xmath69 is the deceleration parameter , @xmath70 is the hubble parameter , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the density and shear of the cosmic medium ) .    * @xmath62 * equation ( [ 6.1 ] ) is based on approximations that are not explicitly spelled out @xcite .",
    "an approximate equation can not determine the sign of anything .",
    "@xcite provide explicit counterexamples to ( [ 6.1 ] ) . if the approximations are taken as exact constraints imposed on the l ",
    "t model , they imply the vacuum ( schwarzschild ) limit . moreover , the @xmath69 of ( [ 6.1 ] ) , although it coincides with the deceleration parameter in the r  w limit , is not a measure of deceleration in an inhomogeneous model .",
    "@xmath63 there is a _",
    "`` pathology '' _ in the l ",
    "t models that causes the redshift - space mass density to become infinite at a certain location ( called _ `` critical point '' _ ) along the past light cone of the central observer @xcite .    *",
    "@xmath62 * the `` critical point '' is the apparent horizon ( ah ) , at which the past light cone of the central observer begins to re - converge toward the past .",
    "this re - convergence had long been known in the r  w models @xcite , and the infinity in density is a purely numerical artefact  a consequence of trying to integrate past ah an expression that becomes 0/0 at the ah .",
    "ways to handle this problem are known @xcite .",
    "@xmath63 fitting the l  t model to cosmological observations , such as number counts or the hubble function along the past light cone , results in predicting a _ huge void _ , at least several hundred mpc in radius , around the centre ( too many papers to be cited , literature still growing ) .",

    "the giant void is not implied @xcite .",
    "@xmath63 the _ bang time function must be constant _",
    "because @xmath73 generates decaying inhomogeneities , which would have to be `` huge '' in the past , and this would contradict the predictions of the inflationary models ( private communication from the referees of @xcite ) .",
    "* @xmath62 * the l ",
    "t models are not supposed to apply prior to the emission of cmb because the pressure in them is zero .",
    "thus , their predictions for times close to the big bang can not be taken literally .",
    "moreover , the occurrence of inflation is not in any way proven .",
