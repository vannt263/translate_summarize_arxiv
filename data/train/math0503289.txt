    "the busemann - petty problem asks whether origin symmetric convex bodies in @xmath0 with smaller hyperplane sections necessarily have smaller volume .",

    "the lower dimensional busemann - petty problem ( ldbp ) in @xmath0 asks the same question with @xmath1-dimensional subspaces in place of hyperplanes .",
    "bourgain and zhang @xcite proved that this problem has a negative answer if @xmath7 , see @xcite for another solution .",
    "the cases @xmath3 are still open in dimensions @xmath8 .",
    "in this paper we study the lower dimensional busemann - petty problem in the hyperbolic space .",
    "namely , let @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 be origin - symmetric convex bodies in @xmath4 , @xmath12 , such that @xmath13 for every @xmath1-dimensional totally geodesic plane through the origin .",
    "does it follow that @xmath14    for the case @xmath15 the answer is trivially affirmative , since in all directions the radius of @xmath10 does not exceed the radius of @xmath11 . in this paper",
    "we prove that the answer to the hyperbolic lower dimensional busemann - petty problem is negative for every @xmath16 .",
    "it is well - known ( see @xcite or @xcite ) that the hyperbolic space @xmath4 can be identified with the interior of the unit ball @xmath17 in @xmath18 with the metric :    @xmath19    this is called the poincar model of the hyperbolic space in the ball . the geodesic lines in this model are arcs of the circles orthogonal to the boundary of the ball @xmath17 and straight lines through the origin .",
    "since for any two points in the hyperbolic space there exists a unique geodesic connecting them , the definition of convexity in the hyperbolic space will be analogous to that in the euclidean space ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter i ,  12 ) ) .",
    "a body @xmath10 ( compact set with non - empty interior ) is called _ convex _ , if for every pair of points in @xmath10 , the geodesic segment joining them also belongs to the body @xmath10 .    in order to distinguish between different types of convexity in the unit ball , we use the following system of notations .",
    "let @xmath10 be a body in the open unit ball @xmath17 . the body @xmath10 is called h - convex , if it is convex in the hyperbolic metric defined in the ball @xmath17 . similarly it is called e - convex , if it is convex in the usual euclidean sense .",
    "analogously , h - geodesics are the straight lines of the hyperbolic metric and e - geodesics are the usual euclidean straight lines .",

    "if @xmath25 then the radial function @xmath26 is the euclidean distance from the origin to the boundary of @xmath10 in the direction of @xmath27 .",
    "the volume element of the metric ( [ eqn : metric ] ) equals    @xmath28 therefore the hyperbolic volume of a body @xmath10 is given by the formula : @xmath29 note that in the polar coordinates of @xmath0 the latter formula looks as follows : @xmath30 similarly , if @xmath31 is a @xmath1-dimensional hyperbolic totally geodesic plane through the origin ( as mentioned above , this is just a @xmath1-dimensional euclidean plane through the origin ) , then the volume element of @xmath31 in the metric ( [ eqn : metric ] ) is @xmath32 therefore the hyperbolic @xmath1-volume of the section of @xmath10 by @xmath31 is given by the formula : @xmath33 or in polar coordinates : @xmath34    even though our main object is hyperbolic geometry , let us briefly mention that , along with the hyperbolic and euclidean metrics , we can define the spherical metric in the unit ball @xmath17 : @xmath35 the geodesic lines in this model are arcs of the circles intersecting the boundary of the ball @xmath17 in antipodal points and straight lines through the origin .",

    "we will use a construction similar to ( * ? ? ?",

    "( note , that @xmath96 is well - defined , since @xmath11 lies entirely in the unit ball @xmath17 and the denominator in the latter formula is never equal to zero ) .",
    "clearly the body @xmath96 is the image of @xmath11 under the map : @xmath97 it can be checked directly that the cylinder is mapped into the surface of revolution obtained by rotating the hyperbola @xmath98 about the @xmath94-axis , and the top and bottom spherical caps are mapped into flat disks .",
    "the latter follows from the fact that ( [ eqn : map ] ) maps s - geodesics into e - geodesics .",
    "indeed , without loss of generality we may consider a s - geodesic given by the equation : @xmath99 in some 2-dimensional plane .",
    "the image of this s - geodesic under the map ( [ eqn : map ] ) is an e - geodesic @xmath100 .",
    "the body @xmath11 constructed above is not smooth .",
    "but we can approximate it by infinitely smooth e - convex bodies that differ from @xmath11 only in a small neighborhood of the edges .",
    "since the body @xmath96 is obtained from @xmath11 by ( [ eqn : m ] ) , and the denominator in ( [ eqn : m ] ) is never equal to zero , the body @xmath96 is also infinitely smooth .        let the height of the cylindrical part of @xmath11 be equal to @xmath103 and the height of its image under ( [ eqn : map ] ) equal to @xmath104 ( see the picture below ) .",
    "since the radius of the cylinder equals @xmath93 , when @xmath105 tends to zero the top and bottom parts of the body @xmath11 get closer to the sphere @xmath106 . recalling the definition of the radial function of @xmath96 :",
    "@xmath107 one can see that the height @xmath104 of the body @xmath96 approaches infinity as @xmath108 .            to estimate the first integral we use the binomial theorem , @xmath111 where the last inequality was obtained by putting @xmath112 in all the terms of the binomial expansion , except for the third term .",
