    "in the following two scenarios for the extraction of the fundamental parameters from experimental data will be discussed .",
    "the first example is vintage supersymmetry as an example for the precision achievable at the lhc when supersymmetry provides a multitude of signatures .",
    "the second example is difficult supersymmetry , be it that most , but not all of the supersymmetric partners are not observed , or that only a light higgs boson is observed and its properties measured at the lhc .    in a supersymmetric theory , each fermionic degree of freedom",
    "has a bosonic counter part and vice versa .",
    "squarks , sleptons , neutralinos and charginos are the partners of the quarks , leptons , neutral and charged gauge and higgs bosons .",
    "supersymmetric theories have `` no '' problems with radiative corrections , they predict a light higgs boson with a mass less than 150  gev , provide interesting phenomenology at the the tev scale and may provide a link to the planck scale .",
    "many different models describe the phenomenology of supersymmetry . in the following sections ,",
    "three of these will be discussed : msugra as an example of a model with few parameters , most of which are defined at the grand unification scale ( gut ) , decoupled scalars supersymmetry ( dss ) as an example where a part of the supersymmetric spectrum is unobservable at the lhc , and the mssm as a an example of a model defined at the electroweak scale with many parameters . determining this model ( in contrast to msugra )",
    "may allow to measure grand unification of the supersymmetric breaking parameters .",
    "r  parity is conserved in the following thus supersymmetric particles ( cascade-)decay to the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) . in the following",
    "the lightest neutralino will play the role of the lsp .",
    "it is stable , neutral and weakly interacting .",
    "the lsp is a candidate for dark matter .",
    "the experimental signature for supersymmetry at colliders is missing transverse energy due to the presence of the undetected lsp(s ) .    in the present absence of supersymmetric signals",
    "it is necessary to define benchmark points in order to study the potential of supersymmetry discovery and measurement .",
    "the reference point sps1a",
    "@xcite has been studied intensely in the past years in lhc as well as ilc simulations  @xcite : in sps1a gluinos and squarks have masses of the order of 500600  gev , light sleptons have masses of 150  gev and the higgs boson is at the lep limit .",
    "the difficulties of determining the fundamental parameters from measurements can be illustrated by taking msugra as an example .",
    "the mass of the smuon depends on m@xmath0 , m@xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the mass of the chargino depends on m@xmath1 and @xmath2 , thus the same parameter has an impact on different measurements . additionally the experimental errors can be correlated and each theoretical prediction also has an error associated to it .",
    "thus in order to disentangle the system to obtain the best possible precision on all parameters , a global ansatz is necessary .    for each observable in addition to a precise `` experimental '' determination , a precise theory prediction must be associated .",
    "this means the most up to date calculations for masses , branching ratios , cross sections as well as dark matter predictions have to be used .",
    "a summary of different tools is listed in  @xcite .",
    "the first study of this type was performed in  @xcite .",
    "the fittino  @xcite and sfitter  @xcite collaborations studied the reconstruction of parameters with sophisticated techniques which will be described later .",
    "while no direct observation of a supersymmetric particle is available , the theoretical predictions of precision observables are sensitive , via radiative corrections , to the parameters of supersymmetry .",
    "a wealth of precise measurements such as the mass of the w  boson and the top quark mass have been made at lep  @xcite and the tevatron  @xcite . additionally precise measurements in the b ",
    "sector , such as the branching ratio of b@xmath3s@xmath4 have been performed .",
    "the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ( @xmath5 ) is known with very good precision and wmap has provided a measurement of the relic density .",
    "plane as well as the contours including and excluding the wmap measurements . ]",
    "the comparison of the predictions with the measurements allows to determine the parameters of msugra  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : ewposusy ] shows the best ",
    "fit point in the @xmath6 plane . due to",
    "@xmath5 a positive sign of @xmath7 is favored .",
    "it is intriguing to note that the sps1a point , a point considered to be overly optimistic at the time of its definition , is close to the best ",
    "fit point .",
    "this approach can be taken a step further by fitting the phenomenological mssm , a weak scale model with about 20 supersymmetric parameters . using a bayesian approach with a linear prior and a logarithmic prior",
    ", one can infer on the mssm parameters as shown in  @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the results on the prior should disappear as more information ( such as supersymmetric mass measurements ) become available .",
    "it is interesting to note that in this study the preference for a positive sign of the @xmath7 parameter from the muon anomalous magnetic moment is not observed .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     [ tab : higgschannels ]    at this point all supersymmetric parameters have been determined , therefore the complete particle spectrum can be deduced . from the spectrum and its couplings the relic density",
    "is predicted  @xcite . neglecting the theoretical error and performing the analysis in msugra",
    ", a precision of about 2% is expected at the lhc with an improvement by an order of magnitude expected from the ilc .",
    "the precision depends on the exact nature of the parameter set and is not valid in all scenarios .",
    "the precision compares well to the one expected by the planck satellite which was successfully launched recently .",
    "thus the confrontation of the collider prediction of the relic density and the measurement of the cosmic microwave background fluctuation will provide for interesting physics studies in the future .",
    "while one can hope for the lhc discovery of sps1a - like supersymmetry as hinted by the analysis of precision observables of the electroweak sector , b - sector and the relic density , difficult scenarios must also be envisaged .",
    "one of these is dss , also known as split - susy ( @xcite and references therein ) . in these models the scalars are too heavy to be produced at the lhc .",
    "however several observables are still present : the mass of the lightest higgs boson , the mass difference between the second lightest neutralino and the lsp , the cross section of the tri  lepton signal , ratios of the decay of supersymmetric particles to the z boson and the gluino production cross section . putting all of this together",
    ", the dss parameters can be determined and measured at the lhc .",
    "this is an indication that the lhc can also handle difficult scenarios .",
    "another difficult scenario at the lhc would be that only a light boson with a mass of about 120  gev is discovered at the lhc but no ( other ) new particles .",
    "the expected measurement channels and their experimental and theoretical errors are shown in table  [ tab : higgschannels ] .",
    "while an ilc is capable of a model independent search for the higgs boson , at the lhc the search and measurement is restricted to well defined final states .",
    "studying the precision of the determination of the higgs couplings could shed light on new physics .",
    "the study presented here  @xcite uses essentially the same montecarlodata as  @xcite with two important differences : in agrement with more recent experimental studies by atlas and cms  @xcite , the tth@xmath3bb signal is reduced by 50% . on the other hand the new theoretical analysis of the zh(@xmath3bb )",
    "( subjet analysis )  @xcite is used , confirmed by atlas within 10%  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical errors on the production cross section are between 7% and 13% .",
    "the errors on the branching ratio calculations are between 1% and 4% ( c quarks ) .",
    "the experimental errors have a statistical uncorrelated component and a several sources of systematic error which are highly correlated among measurements .",
    "determining the higgs couplings from this system is therefore similar to the determination of supersymmetric parameters , i.e. , the same techniques can be used to extract the couplings .",
    "the additional difficulty to be mastered as some of the channels are in the poisson regime is the convolution of the flat , gaussian and poisson errors .",
    "the parameters are defined in the following way for tree level couplings : @xmath8 as deviations from the standard model value . for the loop induced couplings such as the @xmath9h and ggh couplings , the definition is as follows @xmath10 the additional term @xmath11 is the modification of the jjh effective coupling induced by a deviation of the tree level couplings of the particles in the loop .    as in the supersymmetric case ,",
    "first a full dimensional likelihood map is calculated from which the bayesian and frequentist projections are possible . in the higgs analysis",
    "however no true secondary minima exist and the noise effects of the bayesian integration are large , essentially washing out the signal",
    ". therefore only the frequentist projection is pursued .",
    "two main observations can be made after the projections to two dimensions : there is a general positive correlation among all couplings with the exception of the bbh coupling .",
    "this is due to the fact that for a higgs boson mass of 120  gev the total width is dominated by the decay to b - quarks ( approximately 90% ) .",
    "the total width enters in the denominator of every observable , whereas the individual partial widths , proportional to the couplings ( squared ) enter in the numerator .    the second observation , as shown in figure  [ fig : higgscouplings ] ( left ) , is that as long as no additional contributions in the loop induced couplings are allowed ( @xmath12 fixed to 0 ) , a preference for the correct sign of the tth coupling with respect to the wwh coupling is observed .",
    "this is due to the higgs decay channel to photons .",
    "allowing genuine anomalous couplings in the loop induced couplings destroys this distinction completely as the additional parameter allows for the compensation of the sign preference without a penality to be paid in the @xmath13 value .",
    "it is also illustrative to remember what the lhc can not do in addition to what it can do .",
    "all observables are have the structure ( simplified ) of cross section times branching ratio .",
    "expressed in partial widths we have @xmath14 .",
    "as partial widths are proportional to the square of the couplings , the structure becomes @xmath15 .",
    "thus if a coupling not measured at the lhc , e.g. hcc is much larger than expected , the total width will increase , but the coupling determination would show deviations from the standard model , i.e. , couplings smaller than expected .",
    "a simultaneous determination of the individual couplings and the total width is not possible as no model independent channel is available .",
    "thus the lhc can measure absolute couplings only under the assumption that all non  measured couplings are equal to their standard model prediction .    with this caveat in mind , assuming an integrated luminosity of 30  fb@xmath16 , the higgs boson couplings can be determined with a precision of 30% ( wwh ) to 50% ( tth ) . as before toy experiments were used to obtain these results",
    "the precision is somewhat affected  @xcite by whether effective couplings are allowed to vary or not .",
    "the effect is of the order of up to 20% ( relative ) .",
    "if the ratios of couplings are analysed instead of the couplings and the wwh coupling is used as reference , the precision is of the order of 30% . while part of the theoretical and experimental error cancel and therefore one could expect some improvement , with an integrated luminosity of 30  fb@xmath16 the statistical error is still dominant .",
    "the conclusions could therefore change as more data will become available .    in figure  [ fig : higgssubjet ] ( left )",
    "the ( bbh , wwh ) coupling plane is shown using the full sensitivity of the analysis . in the same figure",
    "( right ) the impact of removing the analysis completely is shown .",
    "the spread of the central region is much larger .",
    "the subjet analysis is essential for the higgs coupling determination at the lhc because of the importance of the bbh coupling for low higgs boson masses .",
    "once the higgs couplings are determined one can ask whether the precision is sufficient to exclude new physics .",
    "the task looks daunting given the precision of the individual couplings .",
    "however not only the individual couplings are important but also their correlations .",
    "the loglikelihood is used as an estimator take all correlations into account .    in the gluophobic higgs",
    "@xcite model the stop quark and top quark contributions cancel to reduce the ggh coupling to 24% of the standard model value , i.e. the cross section for gluon fusion processes is reduced by a factor 25 . in this case at 90% c.l .",
    "46% of the toy experiments are not described by the standard model .    in a second scenario",
    "the parameter set sps1a was moved out of the decoupling region by modifying the mass of the cp ",
    "odd higgs boson a , the top tri  linear coupling and @xmath2 .",
    "some of the channels are enhanced , others are reduced by almost 40% . at 90% c.l .",
    "77% of the toy experiments are not described by the standard model .",
    "if vintage supersymmetry , as hinted by the electroweak fits , is found at the lhc , a large number of measurements will be available which can be translated into the fundamental parameters of msugra and even the mssm . to unambiguously determine the parameter set and measure grand unification of the breaking parameters however the ilc will be necessary .",
    "the lhc is prepared to determine the fundamental parameters in difficult scenarios , e.g. , if only a higgs boson is discovered at the lhc .",
    "a determination of the higgs couplings can shed light on new physics .",
    "the extraction of the fundamental parameters of any theoretical model is a formidable task which requires a close collaboration of experimentalists and theorists to develop the sophisticated analyses to determine the fundamental parameters at the lhc ( and beyond at the ilc ) whatever nature has in store .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the organizers for the wonderful conference .",
    "most of the work presented in this paper are the results of the sfitter collaboration consisting of tilman plehn , michael rauch and rmi lafaye with michael dhrssen and claire adam .",
    "i am indebted to all of them for their help in the preparation of the talk and the manuscript .",
