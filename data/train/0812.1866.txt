    "through the understanding of d - branes and string duality ( see , for example , the text book by polchinski  @xcite ) , a more fundamental underling theory called m - theory has been expected and each string theory is realized as various limits in m - theory . although this m - theory is expected , we have only poor understanding .",
    "its low energy effective theory is given by the eleven dimensional supergravity and it would be a theory of membrane compared from a string theory which is a theory of string .",
    "the strong string coupling limit of iia string theory opens up the eleventh space and is described by m - theory .",
    "it is conjectured that m - theory in an infinite momentum frame is described by bfss matrix model  @xcite .",
    "the quantization of a membrane worldvolume theory is very challenging and one of difficulty is the nonlocality associated with the deformation of membrane without changing its volume ( see , for example , a review by taylor  @xcite ) . in string theory",
    ", the open string and closed string duality appears in many situations and has provided many powerful techniques .",
    "one important idea behind bfss matrix model is also based on the open - closed string duality and the worldvolume theory of multiple d0-brane , ( which is governed by open string fluctuations ) describes the target space dynamics , i.e. the gravity in the target space ( which is governed by closed string fluctuations ) .",
    "therefore another direction to approach to m - theory is studying the effective action for multiple membrane .",
    "recently bagger and lambert ( bl ) constructed a new three dimensional n=8 superconformal theory using a three algebra  @xcite ( see also  @xcite by gustavsson ) .",
    "since bl theory satisfies all the properties which multiple membrane should have , it is expected to describe multiple membranes .",
    "for bl theory with @xmath6 gauge symmetry , the moduli space  @xcite is discussed and the theory is conjectured to describe a two membrane system in an orbifold space  @xcite .",
    "soon after the work by bagger - lambert , aharony , bergman , jafferis and maldacena ( abjm ) generalize their idea and constructed three dimensional n=6 superconformal theories which contain bl theory as a special case  @xcite .",
    "abjm also show the membrane configuration in the eleven dimensional orbifold space time ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the level of chern - simons coupling ) for their n=6 theory with @xmath9 gauge symmetry . since the matter fields are charged under @xmath10 in @xmath11 and then @xmath10 is not decoupled from @xmath12 in abjm theory , bl theory with @xmath13 may not describe a multiple membrane system .",
    "however @xmath10 gauge coupling is ir free and the bl theory and abjm theory with @xmath14 gauge symmetry may be connected by a renormalization flow .",
    "the target space superalgebra is studied in bl theory with the central element which suggests the target space is an eleven dimensional space  @xcite .",
    "it is also discussed that bl theory with the nambu - poisson algebra turns out be an action of single m5-brane  @xcite .",
    "therefore we may still expect that bl theory describes multiple membranes .",
    "if so , it worths studying a possibility that multiple membrane dynamics can describe a target space dynamics , as parallel to that the d - brane dynamics describes the target space dynamics",
    ".    one important consequence of open - closed string duality is probing the target space from d - brane scattering using d - brane effective theory , i.e. super yang - mills theory ( sym )  @xcite where the one loop effective potential reproduces the newton potential in the target space .",
    "we then expect a similar correspondence in m - theory , and in this note we study the one loop effective potential around a relatively moving membrane background in bl theory and see if the potential is understood as the newton potential in the target space . since the target space is discussed to be an orbifold @xmath7 , we study a small @xmath8 case in order to probe the whole spacetime otherwise the one spacial direction is effectively compactified in a large @xmath8 case ( @xmath15 is a subgroup of a @xmath10 and we can always define one spacial direction generated by this @xmath10 for any value of @xmath8 .",
    "we call this direction the compactified direction . )",
    ". however the coupling constant is proportional to @xmath16 , the theory is strongly coupled for a small @xmath8 and the perturbation will not be a good expansion . despite of that we still expect the one loop effective potential qualitatively gives a correct answer , since we expect that an one loop open membrane amplitude can be reinterpreted as a tree closed membrane amplitude , and also we treat a small deviation from bps state .",
    "this situation is similar to bfss matrix model .",
    "one should take a large n limit ( n is the size of matrix ) to recover the eleven dimensional lorentz invariance , and the matrix model should give a controllable description at a shorter distance than the plank length  @xcite at which we may expect the spacetime no longer looks like a eleven ( or ten ) dimensional classical spacetime . despite of these , even for a finite n ( n is the size of matrix ) , the one loop effective potential reproduces the newton potential .    with this expectation in mind , we study the membrane scattering and compute the one loop effective potential in bl theory .",
    "the membrane scattering in abjm theory is mentioned in  @xcite and that in lorentzian bl theory is discussed in  @xcite . from our calculations , we find that the potential is understood as the newton potential and the total dimension of target space , which is read from the exponent of the power law behavior , is ten",
    ". the potential does not show a different behavior depending on the value of @xmath8 .",
    "thus in a large @xmath8 limit , the potential consistently becomes the one computed from d2-brane sym action .",
    "this result suggests that the open membrane , described as a perturbation from the background , always wraps the compactified direction even @xmath8 is finite and small , and the bl theory can probe only remaining ten dimensions .    using the three dimensional sym action for multiple d2-branes , the membrane scattering has been discussed .",
    "polchinski and pouliot discussed the membrane scattering with momentum transfer along the eleventh direction ( m - momentum transfer ) corresponds to an instanton process  @xcite .",
    "we will see that the same happens in bl theory .    in the next section",
    ", we review the moduli space of bl theory and introduce the general form of small velocity which corresponds to motion of membranes . in sec.3",
    ", we compute the one loop effective potential around backgrounds with several velocities and discuss what bl theory can probe about the target space . in sec.4 , we summarize and conclude .",
    "+   + during the preparation of present paper , we received the paper  @xcite .",
    "the authors calculate 1-loop effective potential of abjm theory and see an agreement with the newton potential on @xmath17 .",
    "after a suitable gauge transformation , the vacuum configuration ( with the gauge fields and fermions are zero ) is @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are real values , and the index @xmath21 is the index for the three algebra .",
    "there are two sets of eight values @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and then @xmath30 and @xmath31 are related with the position of two membranes in the eight dimensional transverse directions in the target space . the moduli space should be divided by the gauge symmetry .",
    "the discrete symmetry @xmath32 act on two vectors like : @xmath33 and the moduli space becomes @xmath34 .",
    "the moduli space should be further divided by the continuous gauge symmetry .",
    "since the gauge fields have the chern - simons coupling , the continuous symmetry which keeps the chern - simons term invariant and @xmath35 is @xmath36 : @xmath37 where @xmath38 . then the moduli space is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a dihedral group and for @xmath41 it is just @xmath42 and the target space is expected to @xmath43 .",
    "this @xmath15 is a subgroup of @xmath10 , and this @xmath10 generate one spacial direction and we call this direction the compactified direction even for a finite @xmath8 . in the large @xmath8 limit , this direction is identified and the bl theory reduces to the weakly coupled iia theory  @xcite .",
    "using @xmath1 global symmetry , the form of @xmath44 can be written @xmath45     coordinate , ( @xmath46 ) and ( @xmath47 ) .",

    "when @xmath54 and @xmath55 , one can integrate out massive gauge fields and obtain @xmath56 ( plus free @xmath10 ) sym theory , i.e. d2-brane action , at the leading order in @xmath57  @xcite . if @xmath58 then turns on , @xmath56 gauge symmetry is broken down to @xmath10 and the masses of massive gauge bosons are given @xmath59 . therefore @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the gauge coupling of sym and @xmath62 is the distance between two branes . since only the product @xmath63 appears in the lagrangian , there is an ambiguity for @xmath61 ( and @xmath62 ) .",
    "we know there is a symmetry under the exchange of @xmath64 and @xmath58 , and in @xmath65 limit the theory reduces to the d2-brane system , and thus we choose @xmath66 and @xmath67 in this note .    since we would like to discuss the scattering of membranes , we introduce the small time dependence into @xmath68 . solving the equations of motion for @xmath69 and @xmath68 under @xmath35",
    ", we obtain @xmath70 and except that @xmath71 , all the @xmath72 and @xmath73 are free .",
    "we note that the constraint @xmath71 comes from the equation of motion for @xmath74 which is the gauge field corresponds to the continuous symmetry   and means that the momentum along the compactified direction is set to be zero",
    ". this may be the similar situation to that one light - cone direction is compactified and the momentum along that direction is set to be constant in bfss matrix model .",
    "in the previous section , we review the moduli space and the general form of velocity which satisfies the equation of motion . in this section",
    "we study the one loop effective potential around the background with non - zero velocities . in string theory",
    ", d - brane scattering has been discussed using sym theory and the one loop effective potential reproduces the newton potential in the target space .",
    "thus we expect we can probe the target space from the one loop potential which we will compute in this section .    from the relation which comes from the gauge field @xmath75",
    ", one spacial direction is special and there is no momentum transfer along the direction .",
    "although we expect that the target space is eleven dimensions , this observation implies we can only probe ten dimensions , not eleven dimensions . on the other hand ,",
    "the action has @xmath1 global symmetry and ( supersymmetric ) conformal symmetry and we may expect we can probe eleven dimension according to the discussion by  @xcite .",
    "thus we compute the gravitational potential by applying the idea of computing the gravitational potential from sym theory , to clarify which observation is correct . + before going to the calculation , we notice that the regularization in chern - simons theory is not simple .",
    "a dimensional regularization naively breaks the gauge invariance due to the difficulty of analytic continuation of @xmath76 .",
    "another regularization is adding yang - mills term and a careful study on the regularization methods has been done in  @xcite .",
    "the one loop corrections in bl theory have been discussed with these regularization procedure  @xcite . in our calculation of one loop graphs ,",
    "a dimensional regularization can be adapted .",
    "we first study the case where only @xmath79 and @xmath80 are non - zero . in order to study",
    "the one loop effective potential , we just have to keep quadratic terms in the lagrangian around the background .",
