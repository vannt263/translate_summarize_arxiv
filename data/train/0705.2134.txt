    "after snia@xcite and wmap@xcite observations during last decade , the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe is a major challenge of particle physics and cosmology .",
    "there are currently three candidates for the _ dark - energy _ which derives this accelerated expansion :    * a non - zero cosmological constant@xcite , * a dynamical cosmological constant ( quintessence scalar field)@xcite , * modifications of einstein theory of gravity@xcite    the scalar field model like quintessence is a simple model with time dependent @xmath2 , which is generally larger than @xmath3 . because the different @xmath2 leads to a different expansion history of the universe , the geometrical measurements of cosmic expansion through observations of snia , cmb , and baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) can give us tight constraints on @xmath2 .",
    "one of the interesting way to study the scalar field dark energy models is to investigate the coupling between the dark energy and the other matter fields .",
    "in fact , a number of models which realize the interaction between dark energy and dark matter , or even visible matters , have been proposed so far @xcite .",
    "observations of the effects of these interactions will offer an unique opportunity to detect a cosmological scalar field @xcite .    in this paper , after reviewing shortly the main idea of the three possible candidates of dark energy and their cosmological phenomena in section ii , we discuss the interacting dark energy model , paying particular attention to the interacting mechanism between dark - energy with a hot dark - matter ( neutrinos ) in section iii . in this so - called mass - varying neutinos ( mavans )",
    "model @xcite , we calculate explicitly cosmic microwave background(cmb ) radiation and large scale structure(lss ) within cosmological perturbation theory . the evolution of the mass of neutrinos is determined by the quintessence scalar filed , which is responsible for the cosmic acceleration today .",
    "recently , perturbation equations for this class of models are nicely presented by brookfield et al .",
    "@xcite , ( see also @xcite ) which are necessary to compute cmb and lss spectra . a main difference here from their works is that we correctly take into account the scattering term in the geodesic equation of neutrinos , which was omitted there ( see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "we will show that this leads significant differences in the resultant spectra and hence the different observational constraints . in section iv",
    ", we discuss three different types of quintessence potential , namely , an inverse power law potential , a supergravity potential , and an exponential type potential . by computing cmb and lss spectra with these quintessential potentials and comparing them to the latest observations , the constraints on the present mass of neutrinos and",
    "coupling parameters are derived . in conclusion",
    "we discuss two important points of this work on the impact of the scattering term of the boltzmann equation and on the stability issue in the interacting dark - energy model . in appendix",
    "a , the explicit calculation for the consistency check of our calculations in section iii is shown .",
    "since we were asked to show explicit derivation of geodesic equation after our first draft was released , we show them in appendix b.",
    "recent observations with supernova ia type ( snia ) and cmb radiation have provided strong evidence that we live now in an accelerating and almost flat universe . in general",
    ", one believes that the dominance of a dark - energy component with negative pressure in the present era is responsible for the universe s accelerated expansion .",
    "however there are three possible solutions to explain the accelerating universe .",
    "the einstein equation in general relativity is given by the following form : @xmath4 here , @xmath5 term contains the information of geometrical structure , the energy - momentum tensor @xmath6 keeps the information of matter distributions , and the last term is so called the cosmological constant which contain the information of non - zero vacuum energy .",
    "after solve the einstein equation , one can drive a simple relation : @xmath7 in order to get the accelerating expansion , either cosmological constant @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) becomes positive or a new concept of dark - energy with the negative pressure ( @xmath10 ) needs to be introduced .",
    "another solution can be given by the modification of geometrical structure which can provide a repulsive source of gravitational force .",
    "in this case , the attractive gravitational force term is dominant in early stage of universe , however at later time near the present era , repulsive term become important and drives universe to be expanded with an acceleration .",
    "also we can consider extra - energy density contributions from bulk space in brane - world scenario models , which can modify the friedmann equation as @xmath11 . in summary",
    ", we have three different solutions for the accelerating expansion of our universe as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "probing for the origin of accelerating universe is the most important and challenged problem in high energy physics and cosmology now .",
    "the detail explanation and many references are in a useful review on dark energy@xcite .    in this paper , we concentrate on the second solution using the quintessence field . in present epoch",
    ", the potential term becomes important than kinetic term , which can easily explain the negative pressure with @xmath12 .",
    "however there are many different versions of quintessence field : k - essence@xcite , phantom@xcite , quintom@xcite , .... etc . , and to justify the origin of dark - energy from experimental observations is really a difficult job .",
    "present updated value of the equation of states(eos ) are @xmath13 without any supernova data@xcite .",
    "as explained in previous section , it is really difficult to probe the origin of dark - energy when the dark - energy does nt interact with other matters at all .",
    "here we investigate the cosmological implication of an idea of the dark - energy interacting with neutrinos .",
    "for simplicity , we consider the case that dark - energy and neutrinos are coupled such that the mass of the neutrinos is a function of the scalar field which drives the late time accelerated expansion of the universe . in previous works by fardon et al.@xcite and r. peccei@xcite ,",
    "kinetic energy term was ignored and potential term was treated as a dynamical cosmology constant , which can be applicable for the dynamics near present epoch .",
    "however the kinetic contributions become important to descreibe cosmological perturbations in early stage of universe , which is fully considered in our analysis .      equations for quintessence scalar field",
    "are given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the potential of quintessence scalar field , @xmath16 is additional potential due to the coupling to neutrino particles @xcite , and @xmath17 is the mass of neutrino coupled to the scalar field .",
    "@xmath18 is @xmath19 , where the dot represents the derivative with respect to the conformal time @xmath20 .",
    "energy densities of mass varying neutrino ( mvn ) and quintessence scalar field are described as @xmath21 from equations ( [ eq : rho_nu ] ) and ( [ eq : p_nu ] ) , the equation of motion for the background energy density of neutrinos is given by @xmath22        we work in the synchronous gauge and line element is @xmath23~,\\ ] ] in this metric the chirstoffel symbols which have non - zero values are @xmath24 where dot denotes conformal time derivative .",
    "for cmb anistropies we mainly consider the scalar type perturbations .",
    "we introduce two scalar fields , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , in k - space and write the scalar mode of @xmath27 as a fourier integral @xcite @xmath28~,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "the equation of quintessence scalar field is given by @xmath31 let us write the scalar field as a sum of background value and perturbations around it , @xmath32 .",
    "the perturbation equation is then described as @xmath33 where @xmath34 to describe @xmath35 , we shall write the distribution function of neutrinos with background distribution and perturbation around it as @xmath36 then we can write @xmath37 where @xmath38 for numerical purpose it is useful to rewrite the equations ( [ eq : dvidphi ] ) and ( [ eq : delta(dvidphi ) ] ) as @xmath39 note that perturbation fluid variables in mass varying neutrinos are given by @xmath40 the energy momentum tensor of quintessence is given by @xmath41 and its perturbation is @xmath42 this gives perturbations of quintessence in fulid variables as @xmath43      we have to consider boltzmann equation to solve the evolution of vmn .",
    "a distribution function is written in terms of time ( @xmath20 ) , positions ( @xmath44 ) and their conjugate momentum ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the conjugete momentum is defined as spatial parts of the 4-momentum with lower indices , i.e. , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 .",
    "we also introduce locally orthonormal coordinate @xmath48 , and we write the energy and the momentum in this coordinate as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 .",
    "the relations of these variables in synchronous gauge are given by @xcite , @xmath51 next we define comoving energy and momentum @xmath52 as @xmath53 hereafter , we shall use ( @xmath54 ) as phase space variables , replacing @xmath55 by @xmath56 . here",
    "we have splitted the comoving momentum @xmath57 into its magnitude and direction : @xmath58 , where @xmath59 .",
    "the boltzmann equation is @xmath60 in terms of these variables . from the time component of geodesic equation @xcite , @xmath61 and the relation @xmath62",
    ", we have @xmath63 our analytic formulas in eqs.([eq : eq - a]-[eq : eq - b ] ) are different from those of @xcite and @xcite , since they have omitted the contribution of the varying neutrino mass term .",
    "we shall show later this term also give an important contribution in the first order perturbation of the boltzman equation .",
    "we will write down each term up to @xmath64 : @xmath65 we note that @xmath66 and @xmath67 are @xmath64 .      from the equations above , the zeroth - order boltzmann equation is @xmath68 the fermi - dirac distribution @xmath69 can be a solution . here",
    "@xmath70 is the number of spin degrees of freedom , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the planck and the boltzmann constants .",
    "the first - order boltzmann equation is @xmath73 following previous studies , we shall assume that the initial momentum dependence is axially symmetric so that @xmath74 depends on @xmath75 only through @xmath76 and @xmath77 . with this assumption ,",
    "we expand the perturbation of distribution function , @xmath74 , in a legendre series , @xmath78 then we obtain the hierarchy for mvn @xmath79 where @xmath80 here we used the recursion relation @xmath81 we have to solve these equations with a @xmath76-grid for every wavenumber @xmath82 .",
    "to determine the evolution of scalar field which couples to neutrinos , we should specify the potential of the scalar field .",
    "a variety of quintessence effective potentials can be found in the literature . in the present paper",
    "we examine three type of quintessential potentials .",
    "first we analyze what is a frequently invoked form for the effective potential of the tracker field , i.e. , an inverse power law such as originally analyzed by ratra and peebles @xcite , @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are parameters .",
    "we will also consider a modified form of @xmath15 as proposed by @xcite based on the condition that the quintessence fields be part of supergravity models .",
    "the potential now becomes @xmath86 where the exponential correction becomes important near the present time as @xmath87 .",
    "the fact that this potential has a minimum for @xmath88 changes the dynamics .",
    "it causes the present value of @xmath2 to evolve to a cosmological constant much quicker than for the bare power - law potential @xcite . in these models",
    "the parameter @xmath84 is fixed by the condition that @xmath89 at present .",
    "we will also analyze another class of tracking potential , namely , the potential of exponential type @xcite : @xmath90 this type of potential can lead to accelerating expansion provided that @xmath91 . in figure ( [ fig : energy_densities ] ) , we present examples of evolution of energy densities with these three types of potentials with vanishing coupling strength to neutrinos .      for an illustration",
    "we also plot examples of evolution of energy densities for interacting case with inverse power law potential ( model i ) in fig .",
    "( [ fig : energy_densities_coupled ] ) . in interacting dark energy cases ,",
    "the evolution of the scalar field is determined both by its own potential and interacting term from neutrinos .",
    "when neutrinos are highly relativistic , the interaction term can be expressed as @xmath92 where @xmath93 denotes the energy density of neutrinos with no mass .",
    "the term roughly scales as @xmath94 , and therefore , it dominates deep in the radiation dominated era .",
    "however , because the motion of the scalar field driven by this interaction term is almost suppressed by the friction term , @xmath95 .",
    "the scalar field satisfies the slow roll condition similar to the inflation models , @xmath96 .",
    "thus , the energy density in scalar field and the mass of neutrinos is frozen there .",
    "these behaviors are clearly seen in figs .",
    "( [ fig : energy_densities_coupled ] ) and ( [ fig : mass_evolution ] ) .      as was shown in the previous sections",
    ", the coupling between cosmological neutrinos and dark energy quintessence could modify the cmb and matter power spectra significantly .",
    "it is therefore possible and also important to put constraints on coupling parameters from current observations . for this purpose",
    ", we use the wmap3 @xcite and 2df @xcite data sets .",
    "the flux power spectrum of the lyman-@xmath85 forest can be used to measure the matter power spectrum at small scales around @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "it has been shown , however , that the resultant constraint on neutrino mass can vary significantly from @xmath98ev to @xmath99ev depending on the specific lyman-@xmath85 analysis used @xcite .",
    "the complication arises because the result suffers from the systematic uncertainty regarding to the model for the intergalactic physical effects , i.e. , damping wings , ionizing radiation fluctuations , galactic winds , and so on @xcite .",
    "therefore , we conservatively omit the lyman-@xmath85 forest data from our analysis .    because there are many other cosmological parameters than the mavanu parameters , we follow the markov chain monte carlo(mcmc ) global fit approach @xcite to explore the likelihood space and marginalize over the nuisance parameters to obtain the constraint on parameter(s ) we are interested in .",
    "our parameter space consists of @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the baryon and cdm densities in units of critical density , @xmath103 is the hubble parameter , @xmath20 is the optical depth of compton scattering to the last scattering surface , @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the amplitude and spectral index of primordial density fluctuations , and @xmath106 are the parameters of mavans defined in section iii .",
    "we have put priors on mavans parameters as @xmath107 , and @xmath108 for simplicity and saving the computational time .",
    "our results are shown in figs.([fig : ratra_tri ] ) - ( [ fig : exp_tri ] ) . in these figures",
    "we do not observe the strong degeneracy between the introduced parameters .",
    "this is why one can put tight constraints on mavans parameters from observations . for both models",
    "we consider , larger @xmath85 leads larger @xmath2 at present .",
    "therefore large @xmath85 is not allowed due to the same reason that larger @xmath2 is not allowed from the current observations .",
    "on the other hand , larger @xmath109 will generally lead larger @xmath110 in the early universe .",
    "this means that the effect of neutrinos on the density fluctuation of matter becomes larger leading to the larger damping of the power at small scales .",
    "a complication arise because the mass of neutrinos at the transition from the ultra - relativistic regime to the non - relativistic one is not a monotonic function of @xmath109 as shown in fig.([fig : mass_evolution ] ) .",
    "even so , the coupled neutrinos give larger decrement of small scale power , and therefore one can limit the coupling parameter from the large scale structure data .    one may wonder why we can get such a tight constraint on @xmath109 , because it is naively expected that large @xmath109 value should be allowed if @xmath111 .",
    "in fact , a goodness of fit is still satisfactory with large @xmath109 value when @xmath111 .",
    "however , the parameters which give us the best goodness of fit does not mean the most likely parameters in general . in our parametrization ,",
    "the accepted total volume by mcmc in the parameter space where @xmath112 and @xmath113 was small , meaning that the probability of such a parameter set is low .",
    "we find no observational signature which favors the coupling between mavans and quintessence scalar field , and obtain the upper limit on the coupling parameter as @xmath114 and the present mass of neutrinos is also limited to @xmath115 for models i , ii and iii , respectively .",
    "when we apply the relation between the total sum of the neutrino masses @xmath116 and their contributions to the energy density of the universe : @xmath117 , we obtain the constraint on the total neutrino mass : @xmath118 in the neutrino probe dark - energy model .",
    "the total neutrino mass contributions in the power spectrum is shown in fig [ fig : nu - mass - ps ] , where we can see the significant deviation from observation data in the case of large neutrino masses .",

    "before concluding the paper we should comment two important points of this paper : the impact of the scattering term of the boltzmann equation in sec.iii and on the stability issue in the present models .",
    "recently , perturbation equations for the mavans models were nicely presented by brookfield et al .",
    "@xcite , ( see also @xcite ) which are necessary to compute cmb and lss spectra . a main difference here from their works is that we correctly take into account the scattering term in the geodesic equation of neutrinos , which was omitted there ( see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "because the term is proportional to @xmath167 and first order quantity in perturbation , our results and those of earlier works @xcite remain the same in the background evolutions .",
    "however , as will be shown in the appendix , neglecting this term violates the energy momentum conservation law at linear level leading to the anomalously large isw effect . because the term becomes important when neutrinos become massive , the late time isw is mainly affected through the interaction between dark energy and neutrinos .",
    "consequently , the differences show up at large angular scales . in fig .",
    "( [ fig : comparison - cmb - spectrum ] ) , the differences are shown with and without the scattering term .",
    "the early isw can also be affected by this term to some extent in some massive neutrino models and the height of the first acoustic peak could be changed .",
    "however , the position of the peaks stays almost unchanged because the background expansion histories are the same .    as shown in @xcite , some class of models with mass varying neutrinos suffers from the adiabatic instability at the first order perturbation level .",
    "this is caused by an additional force on neutrinos mediated by the quintessence scalar field and occurs when its effective mass is much larger than the hubble horizon scale , where the effective mass is defined by @xmath168 .",
    "to remedy this situation one should consider an appropriate quintessential potential which has a mass comparable the horizon scale at present , and the models considered in this paper are the case @xcite .",
    "interestingly , some authors have found that one can construct viable mavans models by choosing certain couplings and/or quintessential potentials @xcite .",
    "some of these models even realises @xmath169 . in fig.([fig : m_eff ] ) , masses of the scalar field relative to the horizon scale @xmath170 are plotted .",
    "we find that @xmath171 for almost all period and the models are stable .",
    "we also dipict in fig.([fig : m_eff ] ) the sound speed of neutrinos defined by @xmath172 with a wavenumber @xmath173 mpc@xmath174 .    in summary , we investigate dynamics of dark energy in mass - varying neutrinos .",
    "we show and discuss many interesting aspects of the interacting dark - energy with neutrinos scenario : ( 1 ) to explain the present cosmological observation data , we do nt need to tune the coupling parameters between neutrinos and quintessence field , ( 2 ) even with a inverse power law potential or exponential type potential which seem to be ruled out from the observation of @xmath175 value , we can receive that the apparent value of the equation of states can pushed down lesser than -1 , ( 3 ) as a consequence of global fit , the cosmological neutrino mass bound beyond @xmath176 model was first obtained with the value @xmath177 .",
    "more detail discussions and theoretical predictions on the equation of state and on the absolute mass bound of neutrinos from beta decays and cosmological constrains will appear in the separated paper @xcite .",
    "the form of @xmath178 can be also obtained by demanding conservations of energy and momentum , i.e. , demanding that @xmath179 .",
