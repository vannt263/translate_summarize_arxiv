    "the particle content of the state of a quantum field is an observer - dependent notion .",
    "the best known and most extreme example of this dependence is the case of unruh  dewitt detectors following constant acceleration trajectories in minkowski spacetime , where one or several quantum fields are set to be in their natural vacuum states .",
    "these accelerated detectors , when coupled to the quantum fields , detect a particle spectrum with thermal planckian shape and temperature proportional to their acceleration .",
    "this is the well - known _",
    "unruh effect , _ first proposed by unruh in  @xcite .    to probe the quantum state of a field ,",
    "one has to use some form of particle detector .",
    "probably the best known idealized model of a particle detector is the so - called unruh ",
    "dewitt detector  @xcite .",
    "formally , it consists of a point - like particle with at least two internal energy levels , coupled to a scalar field by means of a simple monopole ( scalar ) interaction .",
    "one can interpret the probability of the detector increasing its internal energy by an amount @xmath0 , due to the interaction with the field , as the probability of the presence of a particle of this same energy @xmath0 in the quantum field .",
    "but the behaviour of a particle detector not only depends on the state of the quantum field , but also on the specific trajectory in spacetime followed by the detector .",
    "thus , this notion of particle will also depend on the trajectory being followed by the detector .",
    "for example , if we make the detector follow an eternal constant acceleration trajectory , and set the quantum state for the field to be the vacuum state ( vacuum as seen by inertial observers ) , we recover the thermal spectrum characteristic of the unruh effect .    for trajectories with ( eternal ) constant acceleration , and in general for ( eternal ) stationary trajectories , it is clear that the probability of excitation of the detector per unit of time is constant along the trajectory . on the other hand , when we want to deal with more general trajectories , several non - trivial issues arise .",
    "the quantity we wish to define is the probability transition rate at some instant of the trajectory .",
    "that is , for an ensemble of identical detectors following the same trajectory we wish to calculate the proportion of them that becomes excited per unit time around some instant of the trajectory .    for a specific implementation of this proposal",
    ", one could use for example a switching function controlling the detector interaction , so that the detector is coupled to the field only during some limited period of time .",
    "excitations of the detector could then ( loosely ) be interpreted as particles detected during this particular period of time . however , in general the introduction of a switching function leads to spurious transitions ( even for inertial observers ) due to the switching process itself  @xcite .",
    "instead , we will follow a somewhat different procedure , first introduced in  @xcite . using the interaction picture",
    ", we formally calculate the probability of transition of a detector coupled to the field ( in a constant time - independent manner ) , but up to some proper time @xmath1 .",
    "then , we differentiate with respect to the instant @xmath1 to calculate what we shall call the _ response function _ , which is the quantity we are looking for .",
    "this quantity is well - defined , and finite , ( at least for a wide class of ` non - anomalous ' trajectories ) .",
    "we will also provide a clear and detailed physical interpretation of this response function in terms of realistic multicomponent detectors , further developing the interpretation pointed out in  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the sharp cut - off implicitly generated when evaluating the probability of excitation only up to some specific instant , has the potential to introduce new regularization problems .",
    "these problems have been already discussed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "we will make use of a formula presented in  @xcite that avoids these problems , and that is particularly useful for our purposes .",
    "a particularly interesting regime for an unruh  dewitt detector is that in which it follows a trajectory with a slowly - varying acceleration @xmath2 .",
    "one expects that in this regime the detector perceives thermal radiation with a slowly - varying temperature , proportional to the acceleration at each instant of the trajectory with the usual unruh formula",
    "@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "we may call it the _ adiabatic regime . _",
    "if we neglected derivatives of the acceleration higher than the first , the regime would in physical units be defined as the one in which @xmath4 .",
    "( this is a constraint on the _ jerk _ in terms of the instantaneous acceleration . )",
    "setting @xmath5 as usual , this constraint is commonly rephrased as @xmath6  @xcite . as explained in  @xcite ( in a different and more general context ) , this is a physically reasonable requirement : if we want the detector to perceive a thermal spectrum with temperature @xmath7 , the _ relative _ change in the acceleration @xmath8 during the time needed to detect a particle of the typical energy in the spectrum , @xmath9 , must be small . in this paper , we will attain this adiabatic regime precisely as a zeroth order approximation of a general asymptotic expansion of the response function of the detector , which we shall call the _",
    "adiabatic expansion_. this is an expansion in powers of the derivatives of @xmath2 .",
    "as we said , a thermal planckian spectrum with temperature proportional to the acceleration is obtained at lowest order .",
    "the other terms will be corrections to that result due to non - adiabaticity , and will become of higher importance the further away we are from the adiabatic regime .",
    "we begin in section  [ expressions ] with a review of the definitions of the physical quantities involved in the description of an unruh  dewitt detector and their physical meaning , followed by a brief discussion of the regularization problems .",
    "we also generically describe a one - dimensional trajectory with a time - dependent acceleration .",
    "then , in section  [ adiab ] we use the expressions introduced in the previous section to calculate the adiabatic expansion of the response function , and in section  [ high_energy ] we discuss its relation to the high - energy behaviour of the detector . in section",
    "[ example ] , we use the adiabatic expansion with an example of a time - dependent accelerated trajectory and discuss the results . we conclude in section  [ summary ] with a brief summary .",
    "throughout the article , we will use natural units @xmath10 . let us consider a quantized klein ",
    "gordon real massless scalar field @xmath11 , defined in a flat @xmath12 spacetime background , interacting with a localized detector @xmath13 , which carries its own clock measuring proper time @xmath1 , and which sweeps out some trajectory @xmath14 through spacetime .",

    "for this reason , one could be tempted to call this function _ click - rate function _ , characterizing the numbers of excitations produced per unit of time .",
    "however , this interpretation is not always completely appropriate as one can check that this function can sometimes attain negative values , indicating de - excitation of the detector , typically in moments of decreasing acceleration .",
    "nevertheless , as we will show below , its behaviour provides important insights regarding the time development of the detection process , and therefore in the particle perception process ( see also the discussion in  @xcite ) .",
    "one could attempt to build more complicated models of more realistic detectors by incorporating notions of irreversibility and detector latency , but such refinements do not seem crucial to the questions we will explore .      in this paper , we are considering a multi - part macro - detector that is always switched on , and we measure average number of micro - detectors excited at some time @xmath1 .",

    "hence the result that @xmath139 vanish for @xmath148 follows directly noting that ( [ derivs - coefs ] ) is proportional to the @xmath147th derivative of a polynomial of degree @xmath153 ( at most ) .",
    "this means that the expansion of the @xmath147th term in the adiabatic expansion @xmath157 in inverse powers of @xmath113 will start from the term with @xmath158 .",
    "the adiabatic expansion up to order @xmath147 gives us automatically the high - energy behaviour up to order @xmath159 .",
    "this relation is natural , because higher energies should depend crucially only on what happens in smaller intervals of time . and",
    "the slower the evolution of the acceleration is , the better a short interval of time `` represents '' what happens in larger intervals .",

    "we have to say one final word about the high - energy expansion .",
    "in  @xcite it is shown that , for a finite - time detector as described in subsection  [ real_detectors ] , the response function falls off faster than any power of @xmath113 when @xmath137 .",
    "thus , it seems that the high energy expansion we have found here is just an artifact of an infinite switching - on time , and a sharp switch - off .",
    "this is true if one considers the power expansion as the tendency of the response function _ for arbitrarily high energies . _",
    "as it is already mentioned in  @xcite , the inverse power behaviour will always be cured with a much faster falloff in this limit , if the detector is switched carefully ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "but one can still use the high energy expansion just as a tool for calculating the response function _ for a fixed @xmath113 _ with arbitrarily good precision .",
    "recalling considerations done in subsection  [ real_detectors ] , as far as one makes sure that the effects due to the switching processes are negligible with respect to the precision desired , the use of the series is perfectly justified , and does give the response function for a finite - time detector .",
    "we will now consider a particular case for the acceleration function @xmath2 , given by @xmath162 .",
    "\\label{g - sw}\\ ] ] the detector begins with no acceleration in the asymptotic past , then starts to increase its acceleration smoothly and , after a transient period of about @xmath163 in proper time , it asymptotically tends to reach a final acceleration that we will normalize to be equal to @xmath164 ( which , together with @xmath165 , determines a natural system of units for the problem ) .",
    "note that this parameter @xmath163 is closely related to the ( inverse of the ) parameter @xmath95 used in order to obtain the adiabatic expansion  ( [ rate - series ] ) .    for this particular acceleration history",
    "the regularized wightman function @xmath99 can be found analytically with the help of symbolic manipulation software ( such as mathematica ) . on the other hand",
    ", the response function needs to be calculated numerically , something we achieve with very high precision , thus providing a very good profile with which we can compare the various expressions obtained in this paper .",
    "let us describe some numerical results .",
    "first , consider the case @xmath166 , so that the acceleration is very slowly varying ( in comparison to the timescale set by its asymptotic value , of the order of @xmath164 ) . in figures  [ dt-1000-en-0 ] to  [ dt-1000-en-3 ] , we plot some graphs of the response function @xmath167 for different values of @xmath113 . we also plot what would be the response function if the detector were just detecting a thermal bath with temperature proportional to @xmath2 , ( the zeroth order approximation , as it is discussed in section  [ adiab ] ) , and the result when using the adiabatic approximation up to the third order .     for @xmath168 , @xmath166 .",
    "dots are the numerical solution , the solid line is the thermal spectrum approximation , and the dashed line ( fully covered by the solid one ) the third order adiabatic approximation . ]     for @xmath169 , @xmath166 .",

    "dots are the numerical solution , the solid line is the thermal spectrum approximation , and the dashed line the third order adiabatic approximation . ]",
    "first of all , we see that , for all the energies considered , the fit with the adiabatic expansion up to the third order is virtually perfect . on the other hand , for low energies the match with the thermal detection seems to be perfect , while for higher energies the results start to differ",
    ". this might seem surprising when taking into account the results found in subsection  [ high_energy ] : the adiabatic expansion up to order @xmath147 coincides with the high energy expansion up to order @xmath159 , so that the higher the energies that we measure , the better the thermal approximation will be .",
    "in particular , the zeroth order adiabatic approximation _ must be exact _ for arbitrarily high energies . and this is true , simply because both the exact result and the approximation are actually zero .",
    "but it is true _ for the absolute difference between the exact value and the approximation . _",
    "what figures  [ dt-1000-en-0 ] to  [ dt-1000-en-3 ] make evident is the _ relative difference , _ in comparison with the magnitude of the exact result ( see the values in the vertical axis ) .",
    "and although the absolute difference between the numerical results and the thermal curve for arbitrarily low energies ( figure  [ dt-1000-en-0 ] ) _ is greater _ than for energies @xmath172 ( figure  [ dt-1000-en-3 ] ) , in a relative sense the difference is negligible for low energies , while for high energies it is much more important . moreover , for energies still of the order of @xmath172 , it is the contribution of the zeroth order term to the total spectrum which is actually negligible with respect to higher order contributions . in particular , the `` bell shape '' that appears in that figure corresponds , to a very good approximation , to the first term in the high energy expansion  ( [ high_de_total ] ) , proportional to @xmath173 .    finally ,",
    "note also that , for @xmath174 , the three curves plotted in all the figures converge to each other .",
    "this is to be expected , since in this region the acceleration approaches a constant value , and thus the zeroth order adiabatic approximation must tend to the exact result .",
    "we will now plot the response function for the case @xmath175 ( figures  [ dt-5-en-0 ] to  [ dt-5-en-2 ] ) .     for @xmath168 , @xmath175 .",
    "dots are the numerical solution , the solid line is the thermal spectrum approximation , and the dashed line the third order adiabatic approximation . ]     for @xmath176 , @xmath175 .",

    "dots are the numerical solution , the solid line is the thermal spectrum approximation , and the dashed line the third order adiabatic approximation . ]    in this case , we are much further away from the adiabatic regime . in contrast to the previous case , even for arbitrarily low energies , deviations from the thermal response function can be clearly seen .",
    "the adiabatic approximation ( up to third order ) starts to fail for lower energies , but it is still virtually exact for higher energies . here",
    "differences with the third order approximation are bigger for lower energies _ even in a relative sense .",
    "_ this is again in agreement with the fact that adiabatic expansion gives `` for the same price '' the high energy expansion .",
    "note in particular that in figure  [ dt-5-en-0 ] the third order expansion seems to be a worse approximation than the zeroth order .",
    "this is what one must expect when staying far from the adiabatic regime , as we are dealing just with an asymptotic series , without ( in general ) any guarantee of convergence .",
    "in this article , we have first calculated the transition probability for an unruh  dewitt detector in minkowski spacetime , when interacting with a klein  gordon massless real scalar field in its minkowski vacuum state .",
    "the detector is set to be in its ground state in the asymptotic past , and we calculate the transition probability when it follows a trajectory @xmath177 up to some time @xmath1 .",
    "we then consider a cumulative multipart macro - detector , as an ensemble of many unruh  dewitt micro - detectors with suitably small coupling constant .",
    "this allows us to use first - order perturbation theory to calculate the average number of detectors that are excited at some time @xmath1 . ignoring the detector s internal details , and taking the derivative with respect to the time @xmath1",
    ", we calculate what we have called the response function @xmath91 at some time @xmath1 and some energy @xmath113 of the detected particle .",
    "we also justify why , and up to what precision , we can consider an idealized situation with an infinite switching time ( from the remote past ) and a sharp switch - off of the detector at @xmath1 when calculating the response function .    using the general expression for accelerated trajectories in one dimension , we manage to write the response function as a functional of the acceleration @xmath92 .",
    "then , we expand in powers of a formal adiabaticity parameter , which is inserted _ by hand _ to control how fast the acceleration changes . after calculating the expansion in terms of this formal parameter , we remove it from each term in the expansion .",
    "the zeroth order term is the thermal spectrum with temperature proportional to the instantaneous acceleration .",
    "that is the well - known unruh effect result .",
    "higher - order terms involve increasingly higher - order derivatives of the acceleration function , ( jerk , snap , etcetera ) .",
    "we see that all the individual terms in the adiabatic expansion tend to zero in the high - frequency limit .",
    "there is no ultraviolet catastrophe for any of these terms .",
    "we also see that the even - order terms decay to zero much faster than any inverse power of @xmath113 , while odd terms of order @xmath147 in the adiabatic expansion are of order @xmath158 . in other words ,",
    "the adiabatic expansion to order @xmath147 automatically gives the high - frequency expansion to order @xmath159 .",
    "finally , we use the adiabatic expansion with a simple but representative example of switch - on function for the acceleration . the numerical results obtained reflect most of the aspects we have discussed in the article .",
    "this example shows that the adiabatic expansion is a useful tool for generalizing the study of the unruh effect to trajectories with variable acceleration .",
    "further generalizations could include ( among many other possibilities ) more than one - dimensional trajectories , non - monopole coupling with the field to study possible anisotropies in the radiation , or the same problem for a field theory in a curved spacetime .",
