    "there are two types of classical relativistic direct interaction theories ( rdit ) , namely , manifestly poincar - invariant four - dimensional formulations and three - dimensional approaches @xcite . applying each of them to the description of real physical @xmath0-particle systems we come across the problem of space - time interpretation of some formal constructions . in four - dimensional approaches difficulties",
    "are caused by the presence of redundant variables specific to many - time formalisms and in three - dimensional ones they are caused by the so - called no - interaction theorem . in the relativistic hamiltonian mechanics , this theorem forbids identification ( in the interaction zone ) of canonical variables @xmath1 with physical ( covariant ) position coordinates @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ; @xmath4 ) which transform as a space part of the events in the minkowski space - time @xcite . in the lagrangian formulation @xcite the no - interaction theorem asserts that the interaction lagrangian depends inevitably on all higher time derivatives @xmath5 , @xmath6 , of the physical particle coordinates .",
    "this theorem is essentially related to the use of individual particle variables ( pv ) in both the hamiltonian and lagrangian approaches .    in papers",
    "@xcite the following approach to the construction of rdit was proposed .",
    "the starting point is the 3-dimensional poincar - invariant lagrangian formalism @xcite with using the physical coordinates @xmath2 and with allowing the connection to field theories via the fokker - type formalism @xcite .",
    "these aspects of the lagrangian description along with the possibility to use the nther theorem for obtaining the conservation laws @xcite are the main advantages of this approach from the point of view of the physical interpretation of the theory .",
    "the next step is a transition to the canonical hamiltonian formalism admitting the quantization of the theory @xcite .",
    "another aspect of rdit is the problem of how to separate the motion of the system as a whole from the internal motion of its constituents .",
    "this problem can be solved in a manner similar to that of the non - relativistic mechanics case by introducing center - of - mass variables ( cmv ) .",
    "relativistic generalization of the non - relativistic notion of the center - of - mass is ambiguous .",
    "the most frequently used are , firstly , the center - of - inertia ( covariant center - of - mass ) whose coordinates @xmath7 are transformed by the poincar group as 3-coordinates of the minkowski - space points , and , secondly , the center - of - spin ( or canonical center - of - mass ) with the canonical coordinates @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "external variables @xmath8 and @xmath9 describing the motion of a system as a whole , along with the corresponding set @xmath10 , @xmath11 of @xmath12 internal variables are often used in the relativistic hamiltonian mechanics @xcite-@xcite .    in the relativistic lagrangian formalism",
    "it is natural to choose the coordinates of the center - of - inertia @xmath13 as external position variables and to formulate the problem of constructing the relativistic lagrangian mechanics of an @xmath0-particle system in terms of cmv .",
    "this set also contains @xmath14 internal variables @xmath15 @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the internal variables @xmath15 may be introduced by postulating their transformation properties with respect to the poincar group .",
    "the corresponding relations which are written down in section 2 constitute the prerequisites which enable us to find a connection between cmv and pv and , accordingly , between the relativistic lagrangians in terms of these two classes of variables .",
    "an important feature of cmv is the existence of the poincar - invariant interaction lagrangians which depend only on a finite number of time derivatives ( section 3 ) .",
    "the transition to the hamiltonian formalism ( section 4 ) leads to the well - known bakamjian - thomas model supplemented by the relations between the canonical variables and the physical particle positions . in sections 5 and 6",
    "the first - order quasi - relativistic approximation ( up to @xmath16 terms ) is considered from both the classical and the quantum mechanical viewpoints .",
    "relativistic corrections to the energy spectrum of a two - particle system with coulomb - like interactions are calculated as an illustration .",
    "since the external variables @xmath7 describe the motion of an @xmath0-particle system as a whole , we require their transformation properties with respect to the poincar group to be the same as those of the physical coordinates @xmath2 of a single point particle . in the instant form of dynamics",
    "@xcite they are @xcite : @xmath18 here @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are generators of time and space translations , space rotations , and boosts , respectively , and @xmath23 is the total time derivation operator . as usual , the dot denotes the time derivation ( e.g. , @xmath24 are the components of the external velocity @xmath25 ) .",
    "we postulate further that similar to the case of non - relativistic mechanics the internal cmv @xmath15 are the components of the translationally invariant 3-vectors @xmath26 @xmath27 which do not depend explicitly on time : @xmath28 the transformation of these variables with respect to boosts is determined by the poincar group structure .",
    "it can be shown that the commutation relations of the poincar algebra @xmath29 , along with equations ( [ t_r])([t_r ] ) , lead to the following conditions @xcite : @xmath30 the expressions for generators @xmath31 of the poincar group in terms of cmv may be obtained from equations ( [ t_r])([tr ] ) immediately @xcite .",
    "the evolution of a particle system is described by the solutions of the euler - lagrange - ostrogradsky equations @xmath32 following from the variational principle @xmath33 .",
    "the conditions of poincar invariance of equations ( [ el ] ) may be expressed by the system of first - order differential equations for the lagrange function : @xmath34 where the auxiliary functions @xmath35 have to satisfy the compatibility conditions : @xmath36 with @xmath37 being the structure constant tensor of the poincar group @xmath17 .",
    "for this group the relations ( [ cc ] ) admit the following set of functions @xmath35 : @xmath38 in which case the conditions ( [ pi ] ) of poincar invariance take on the form : @xmath39    the structure of equations ( [ cc ] ) is quite different from the structure of the poincar invariance conditions in terms of pv @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "whereas the interaction lagrangian as a function of the particle variables is defined on @xmath40 , equations ( [ cc ] ) admit lagrangians that depend on cmv and their time derivatives of finite orders .",
    "the simplest structure of @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 here @xmath43 and @xmath44 is an arbitrary function of scalar products of the vectors @xmath45\\,,\\qquad { \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\beta$}}_b = \\gamma{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\dot\\alpha$}}_b - c^{-1}\\gamma^2[{\\bf\\ddot r } { \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\alpha$}}_b]\\,,\\\\ { \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\gamma$}}&=&\\gamma{\\bf\\ddot r } + c^{-1}\\gamma^2[{\\bf\\dot r}{\\bf\\ddot r}]+c^{-2}\\gamma({\\bf\\dot r}{\\bf\\ddot r } ) { \\bf\\dot r}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] contrary to @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the @xmath48 dependence of @xmath41 is not necessary .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ l ] ) depending on a finite number of cmv can be made equivalent to the lagrangian defined on an infinite - dimensional set of pv @xmath49 , only if the cmv are functions of all these pv .",
    "the set of equations ( [ t_r])([tr ] ) with generators @xmath50 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , determined in terms of pv @xcite , may be regarded as the basis for determining these functions @xcite .    using the nther theorem for lagrangians with higher derivatives @xcite-@xcite we found ten integrals of motion @xmath51 corresponding to the poincar - invariance of the theory , based on lagrangian ( [ l ] ) . from their analysis",
    "we obtain @xcite the following equation of external motion @xmath52 = { \\bf k}_0\\ ] ] in the rest frame of reference ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the equation @xmath57 = 0\\,,\\ ] ] being the consequence of ( [ em ] ) , was obtained in @xcite for classical particles with a spin ; it is a three - dimensional form of the well - known mathisson equation .",
    "spin * s * is equal to the internal angular momentum of the system .",
    "solving ( [ em ] ) in a coordinate system with the origin at point @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the value of integral @xmath60 in the rest frame and the o@xmath61 axis is directed along spin @xmath62 , we see that point @xmath63 describes a circular motion in a plane orthogonal to the spin : @xmath64 here , frequency @xmath65 ; @xmath66 and @xmath67 are constants of the integration . taking into account the usual non - relativistic limit procedure , in accordance with which the center of mass is at rest as measured in the rest frame , we must set @xmath68 .",
    "indeed , as @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) , the limits of the trigonometric functions in equation ( [ circ ] ) do not exist .",
    "this means that in the set of solutions of equations ( [ el ] ) for the lagrangian ( [ l ] ) we keep only those which satisfy the standard free - particle equation @xmath71 .",
    "there are several ways to obtain the hamiltonian formulation corresponding to the lagrangians with higher derivatives and with supplementary conditions , like @xmath71 @xcite . here",
    "we use an approach close to that of @xcite .",
    "let us perform a change of the variables @xmath72 , where @xmath73}{m(e+mc^2)}\\,,\\\\ { \\bf q}_b&=&\\gamma{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\rho$}}_b - \\frac{c^{-2}\\gamma^2}{\\gamma + 1}{\\bf\\dot r}({\\bf\\dot r}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\rho$}}_b)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] relation ( [ qr ] ) is a definition of the canonical center - of - mass @xcite . in terms of new variables ,",
    "the lagrangian ( [ l ] ) has the form : @xmath74 where @xmath75 contains only the terms which do not contribute to the equations of motion if the external equation of motion @xmath71 is satisfied .",
    "therefore , the term @xmath75 may be omitted in equation ( [ l_td ] ) and , thus , the transformation to the hamiltonian description may be performed in the usual manner on the basis of lagrangian @xmath76 . using the legendre transformation we construct hamiltonian @xmath77 corresponding to lagrangian @xmath76 : @xmath78 where @xmath79 we note that the external momentum variable @xmath13 is a motion integral ( the total momentum of the system ) .",
    "expression ( [ hbk ] ) for @xmath77 reproduces the particle - system hamiltonian of the bakamjian - thomas model @xcite .",
    "the advantage of our way of constructing this model is the possibility to express the internal hamiltonian @xmath80 in terms of the interaction lagrangian which , in turn , may be related to some field models @xcite . on the other hand , in our approach",
    "the canonical variables @xmath81 , and @xmath82 have a definite relation to the lagrangian cmv @xmath83 and their time derivatives @xmath84 and , therefore , to the individual particle variables @xmath85 , at least in the approximations in the parameter @xmath16 .",
    "let us consider the main steps of our approach in the first - order approximation in @xmath16 ( i.e. quasi - relativistic or post - newtonian approximation ) .",
    "we use the following sufficiently general form of a quasi - relativistic two - particle lagrangian with static non - relativistic potential @xmath86 @xcite : @xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath66 and @xmath89 are arbitrary constants and @xmath90 is an arbitrary function . for interactions which correspond to the linear field theories",
    ", we have @xmath91 and constants @xmath66 and @xmath89 depend on the tensor structure of interaction @xcite .",
    "for example , we have @xmath92 for a vector interaction , and @xmath93 for a scalar interaction .",
    "further we consider a specific case of interactions which correspond to the non - relativistic long - range potential @xmath94 where @xmath67 is a constant of the interaction .",
    "we suppose that the galileo - invariant function @xmath90 has the form : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the constant .",
    "let us note five significant cases covered by the interaction described in a quasi - relativistic approximation by the lagrangian of type ( [ lqr ] ) where functions ( [ u(r ) ] ) and ( [ u_1 ] ) enter :    * @xmath97 , and @xmath98 : the darwin lagrangian which describes an electromagnetic interaction of two point charges ; * @xmath99 , and @xmath100 : the einstein - infeld - hoffmann lagrangian which describes a gravitational interaction of two point masses ; * @xmath101 , and @xmath102 : a gravitational interaction of charged bodies ( the baaski lagrangian @xcite ) ; * @xmath103 , and @xmath104 : a gravitational interaction in the ppn - formalism @xcite which classifies suitable theories of gravitation ( i.e.  those which do not contradict the four classical experiments , satisfy the conditions of the lorentz - invariance , and admit @xmath0-particle lagrangian functions ) in the first - order approximation in @xmath16 ; * @xmath105 , and @xmath98 : the lagrangian of the quasi - relativistic approximation of the whitehead - shield theory of gravitation @xcite where the massless tensor field of the second rank as an intermediate field is assumed .",
