    "the 22-yr cycle of solar activity is a magnetic cycle which consists of two 11-years sunspot cycles .",
    "the 22-yr cycles begin on even sunspot cycles according to the zrich numbering ( @xcite ) and manifest themselves in reversal of polarity of sunspots ( hale s law ) . from one 11-yr cycle to another",
    ", the polarity of the preceding ( @xmath0 ) and following ( @xmath1 ) sunspots reverses .",
    "this reversal corresponds to the changing of the toroidal magnetic field ( @xmath2-component ) . during even - numbered cycles @xmath3 ( the direction of the magnetic vector coincides with the direction of solar rotation ) in the northern ( @xmath4 ) hemisphere and @xmath5 in the southern ( @xmath6 ) hemisphere",
    "this relation is reversed during odd - numbered cycles . in parallel with this , the poloidal magnetic field , or background field ( @xmath7-component ) , shows a 22-yr periodicity ( @xcite ) , and other studies ( @xcite ) have suggested that the low - latitude and polar fields similarly show a 22-yr periodicity .",
    "furthermore , these studies have hinted at a shorter term periodicity of about 2  yr ( high - frequency component ) .",
    "in addition , during the periods of the three - fold polar magnetic field reversals which occur during some sunspot cycle maxima , the temporal separation of the zones of alternated polarity of the magnetic field on @xmath8 charts is approximately equal to 1.52.5 years ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "similar periodicities were found in variations of radio flux on @xmath9 ( @xcite ) , flares and sunspot areas ( @xcite ) . the high - frequency , 2-year , component is substantially weaker than the main 22-year cycle and its intensity varies with time .",
    "the two year component more clearly appeared in northern hemisphere in cycle 20 and in southern hemisphere in cycle 21 ; its value was smaller in cycle 22 ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the biennial cycle represents a challenge to the solar dynamo theories which usually explain only the main cycle . in this letter",
    ", i present a new evidence of the two components of the solar cycle , and an attempt to explain the results in term of parker s dynamo theory ( @xcite ) .",
    "using kitt peak magnetograph data we show how synoptic ( longitude independent ) magnetic field patterns evolve through cycles 21 and 22 . each of the synoptic maps is represented by the values of @xmath10 as a function sine latitude and carrington longitude .",
    "the carrington coordinate system is a reference frame rotating rigidly at the rate which corresponds to the synodic rotation rate of sunspots at a latitude of about @xmath11 .",
    "the observed line - of - sight components ( @xmath10 ) averaging over all longitudes for each carrington rotation is represented in figure  1b .",
    "the time step in the time set of values @xmath10 corresponds to carrington rotation period ( @xmath12 days ) .",
    "the relative sunspot number is shown in figure  1a .",
    "component @xmath7 ( figure  1c ) , was calculated from observational data assuming that the true average field direction is radial and @xmath13 .",
    "the radial component will be easily found at all latitudes besides near the poles :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is colatitude .    to separate the high - frequency component in the data , we apply a difference filter by computing @xmath16 for different time intervals @xmath17 .",
    "this is a reasonable procedure if the poloidal magnetic field consists of two components and is represented as two dynamo waves :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the amplitude of the low - frequency radial component of the magnetic field ; @xmath20 is ratio between amplitudes of low - frequency and high - frequency components ; @xmath21 is the frequency of the hale s solar cycle ; @xmath22 is the frequency of biennial cycle ; @xmath23 is a phase .",
    "the expression for the @xmath24 can be written as    @xmath25    when @xmath26 , @xmath27 as it took place in cycle 20 , then the low - frequency term dominates in the expression for @xmath7 ( equation  [ field ] ) and the high - frequency term prevails in the expression for @xmath28 ( equation  [ deriv ] ) .",
    "thus , presuming the existence of the double magnetic cycle , one finds that the low - frequency term prevails in the @xmath7-component , while the high - frequency term dominates in @xmath29 .",
    "contour plots of @xmath24 as a function @xmath30(or @xmath31 ) and time , _ t _ , measured in carrington rotation are represented in figure  1d for @xmath32 . during the cycles 21 and 22 the zones of increasing and decreasing strength of the surface magnetic field appear in both the @xmath4 and @xmath6 hemispheres ( see figure 1d ) .",
    "the width of these zones is approximately 2 years .",
    "this result coincides with investigations done earlier based on wilcox and mount wilson synoptic maps .",
    "corresponding power spectra for @xmath24 show that the component with period @xmath33 years is dominant in both hemispheres ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these results are the basis of our suggestion of a two component of solar cycle .",
    "the possible explanation of the double magnetic cycle is that the magnetic fields are generated by parker s dynamo acting in convective zone .",
    "the low - frequency component is generated at the base of the convective zone due to large scale radial shear @xmath34 ; @xmath35 is the angular velocity .",
    "the high - frequency component may be generated in subsurface regions due to latitudinal shear @xmath36 or due to radial shear .",
    "the recent investigations of solar interior rotation show a significant radial gradient of angular velocity exists in subsurface of the convective zone together with the latitudinal gradient of the angular velocity ( @xcite ) .",
    "for simplicity we use only latitudinal shear for generation of the high - frequency component .",
    "cartesian coordinates are employed , with @xmath37 denoting the radial , @xmath38 the azimuthal and @xmath39 the latitudinal coordinate .",
    "we consider axisymmetrical solutions ( @xmath40 ) .    at the base of the convection zone turbulence",
    "is suppressed by strong magnetic field ( @xcite ) and , therefore , diffusivity in the first layer @xmath41 will could be less then @xmath42 in the second layer .",
    "the axisymmetrical mean magnetic field is decomposed into toroidal and poloidal parts .",
    "the following set of equations describe evolution of the magnetic field in thin layers at the levels @xmath43 and @xmath44 :    @xmath45    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the toroidal magnetic field and @xmath48 is the azimuthal vector potential which gives poloidal field , @xmath49 is diffusivity and @xmath50 is a kinetic helicity , @xmath51 is the variable part of kinetic helicity .",
    "the first and the second equations in the both systems ( [ x1 ] ) and ( [ x2 ] ) are a generation of parker s equations for large - scale radial shear @xmath52 and large - scale latitudinal shear @xmath53 correspondingly .",
    "we have used the third equation in the both systems @xmath54 according to kleeorin and ruzmaikin ( 1982 ) in a simple form , for feedback of the magnetic field on the helicity . in these equations",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 are parameters of the feedback .",
    "these two non - linear differential equation systems describe the evolution of two independent sources of the magnetic field . in the frame of this model",
    "it is difficult to explain observed variations of the high - frequency component .",
    "therefore , we assume that the erupted low - frequency magnetic field can influence the physical conditions in the region where high - frequency component operates , through modifying the helicity there .",
    "this allows the high - frequency component to vary with time . in this case , the equation for @xmath57 becomes @xmath58 , where the parameter @xmath59 captures the feedback of the low - frequency component of the magnetic field on the helicity in regions where the high - frequency component is found . following weiss et al .",
    "( 1984 ) the solutions of these equations were found as @xmath60 and @xmath61 , i m @xmath62 for @xmath43 level and the same expressions for @xmath44 level where @xmath37 is replaced by @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath63 are complex functions as @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "it is convenient to present the system in dimensionless units .",
    "since there will be an underlying periodicity in all calculations , we use those periods as relative units of time . in relative units",
    "@xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is some mean value of the kinetic helicity .",
    "therefore , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are represented as dynamo numbers in our model .",
    "therefore , set of the partial differential equations reduced to the following equations were then solved numerically .",
    "@xmath74    @xmath75    we have investigated solutions of these two non - linear systems as functions of the parameter @xmath59 .",
    "results for three principal cases , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are represented in figure  3 , where @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , which are in the reasonable range for the sun . if @xmath85 we have two independent sources of the magnetic field which together generate low - frequency and high - frequency signatures ( fig .  2  a ,  b ) .",
    "for a weak interaction between these sources ( @xmath86 ) we still get a low and high frequencies response .",
    ".  2  c ,  d ) .",
    "moreover , the high- frequency component becomes more regular , and consequently is decreased when @xmath59 increases . with further increase of the feedback of the low - frequency magnetic field on the helicity near the top surface",
    "the high - frequency component disappears and only a low - frequency mode regime is established ( fig .",
    "2  e ,  f ) .",
    "therefore , in the case of weak interaction between two sources of magnetic field it is possible to obtain a stable double magnetic cycle .",
    "our model simulates the double magnetic cycle and temporal variations of the biennial cycles from one 11-year cycle to another . according to the magnetograph data ( @xcite )",
    "the 2-year component more clearly appeared in the northern hemisphere in cycle 20 and in the southern hemisphere in cycle 21 . in cycle 22",
    "it was present in both hemispheres but was of lower amplitude .    in our model ,",
    "a reduced high - frequency component occurs when the erupted magnetic field of the main ( hale s ) cycle imposes the helicity in the regions of generation of the high - frequency component .",
    "the high - frequency component is more pronounced when the effect of erupting magnetic fields of the main cycle on helicity in this region is small .",
    "thus , this simple model provides a qualitative explanation of the double magnetic cycle .",
    "the next step to a quantitative model is in development of a 2d model in spherical geometry , since this simple model gives only a qualitative picture of the two - components of the solar magnetic cycle .",
