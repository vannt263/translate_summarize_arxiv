    "our conjecture is that the interaction between the two main parameters of the system @xmath24 and @xmath23 should allow us to obtain the true minimizers via a double - limit . in other words , for every value of @xmath23",
    "there is a corresponding orbit which minimizes the functional @xmath25 , and since along this orbit the hamiltonian has to constantly assume a certain value @xmath202 , the minimization process should imply a direct connection between the parameters .",
    "consequently , it is interesting to investigate this ansatz from the numerical viewpoint .     for three different values of @xmath203 ( red , green , blue ) .",

    "however , the period scaling law of the orbits precisely at these fold points , which is shown in ( b ) as three dots corresponding to the three folds in ( a ) and a suitable interpolation ( black line ) , does not converge as @xmath16 ( grey reference line with slope @xmath205 ) . ]",
    "a first possibility is to establish a connection between the two parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 via a direct continuation in both parameters , starting from certain special points , such as the fold points detected in sections  [ ssec : contmu]-[ssec : conteps ] .",
    "however , it turns out that this process does not lead to the correct scaling law for minimizers of @xmath206 as shown in figure  [ fig : figtwop ] .",
    "another option is instead to check if among the critical points of the euler - lagrange equation   we have numerically obtained there are also the minimizers of the functional @xmath25 respecting the power law  . in  @xcite , boundary conditions on the interval @xmath207 $ ] are also included in the variational formulation , and from the results obtained from the continuation in @xmath23 , one may expect that high values of @xmath24 would not be able to fit them , since the period is always too high .",
    "lower values of @xmath24 , instead , seem to have sufficiently small period .",
    "hence , one could fix one of those ( for example , @xmath208 ) and look at what happens as @xmath19 .",
    "the hope is that the @xmath16 leading - order scaling for the period naturally emerges .",
    "unfortunately , this does not happen , as we can see in figure  [ fig : fig5 ] ; the lower branch seems to give a linear dependence on @xmath23 , while the upper branch gives a quadratic one .     for the numerical data computed with @xmath197 ( black line ) : @xmath209 , blue ; @xmath12 , green ; @xmath210 , red . ]",
    "the reason why from this naive approach the @xmath16 leading - order scaling does not emerge lies in the lack of connection with the minimization process .",
    "however , figure  [ fig : fig5 ] demonstrates that there are several nontrivial scalings of natural families of periodic orbits as @xmath192 .",
    "so far , we have just assumed that the hamiltonian value of the minimizers should be `` low '' , but indeed there is a strict connection between the values of @xmath23 one is considering and the value of @xmath24 of the minimizers .",
    "in other words , there is not a unique value of @xmath24 given by the minimizers for every @xmath23 small but minimizers move over different hamiltonian energy levels as @xmath192 .",
    "starting from this consideration , another option , which turns out to be the correct one to recover the scaling  , is to use the periodic orbits from numerical continuation to compute the numerical value of the functional @xmath25 as a function of the period @xmath174 fixing different values of @xmath23 in a suitable range , such as : @xmath211.\\ ] ]    then , we obtain different parabola - shaped diagrams where we can extract the value of the period minimizing the functional ( figure  [ fig : fig7 ] ) .",
    "when plotting these values related to the value of @xmath23 for which they have been computed , one obtains the results shown in figure  [ fig : fig6 ] .",

    "in summary , we have shown that geometric singular perturbation theory and numerical continuation methods can be very effective tools to understand nonconvex multiscale variational problems via the euler - lagrange formulation .",
    "we have proven the existence of a class of singular periodic orbits based upon a fast - slow decomposition approach and we have shown that these orbits persist for @xmath23 small .    the geometric insight was used to determine a starting solution for numerical continuation in the context of a reduced three - dimensional fast - slow system .",
    "then we studied the dependence of periodic orbits on the singular perturbation parameter as well as the hamiltonian energy level set parameter arising in the reduction from a four- to a three - dimensional system .",
    "the parameter space is structured by several fold points .",
    "furthermore , we were able to study the shape of non - minimizing periodic orbits for very broad classes of parameters .",
    "finally , we showed that several natural scaling laws for non - minimizing sequences of periodic solutions exist and also confirmed numerically the leading - order scaling predicted by mller for minimizing sequences .    based upon this work",
    ", there are several open problems as well as generalizations one might consider .",
    "in particular , it would be desirable to extend the persistence result to the general class of singularly - perturbed hamiltonian fast - slow systems  ; this is the subject of ongoing work .",
    "another important observation of our numerical study are the intricate orbits that seem to arise when parts of the slow segments start to interact with the singularities @xmath70 where the critical manifold is not normally hyperbolic .",
    "the natural conjecture is that the additional small fast loops that we observe numerically could correspond to homoclinic `` excursions '' in the fast subsystem anchored at points close to @xmath70 .",
    "the blow - up method  @xcite is likely to provide an excellent tool to resolve the non - normally hyperbolic singularities ; see e.g.  @xcite where the existence of complicated fast - slow periodic orbits involving loss of normal hyperbolicity is proven .",
    "the construction of an initial orbit has been one of the hardest problems to tackle .",
    "it was solved using analytical and numerical tools , after discarding several other plausible approaches .",
    "the smst algorithm @xcite has been a helpful tool to determine good starting points on the slow manifolds and then use an initial value solver to obtain segments of a complete whole orbit .",
    "although our approach works well in practical computations , there are interesting deep numerical analysis questions still to be answered regarding the interplay between certain classes of fast - slow `` initial guess '' starting orbits and the success or failure of newton - type methods for the associated bvps .",
    "in particular , can one prove certain geometric conditions or restrictions on @xmath23 to guarantee the convergence for the first solution ?",
    "another highly relevant direction would be to extend our approach to more general classes of functionals .",
    "there are many different singularly - perturbed variational problems , arising e.g.  in materials science , to which one may apply the techniques presented here . in this context",
    ", it is important to emphasize that we expect that particularly other non - convex functionals could be excellent candidates for future work .    from the viewpoint of applications",
    ", it would be interesting to study the practical relevance of non - minimizing sequences of periodic solutions .",
    "although we expect the long - term behavior to be governed by minimizers , it is evident that non - minimizing periodic orbits can have a high impact on time - dependent dynamics , e.g. , either via transient behavior , via noise - induced phase transitions , or as dynamical boundaries between different regimes .",
