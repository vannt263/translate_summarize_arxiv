    "observational evidence for the presence of dark matter @xcite exists at a variety of length scales .",
    "it is most obvious at galactic scales ( @xmath1 ) where the rotation curves of spiral galaxies have been found to be asymptotically flat , way beyond the radii of their visible disks @xcite .",
    "measurements of rotation curves have also been performed for elliptical @xcite and low - surface - brightness ( lsb ) galaxies @xcite with similar discrepancies . the dark matter to baryonic matter ratio inferred from the rotation curves differs from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "extreme cases such as galaxies whose rotation curves do not require dark matter @xcite have also been discovered.@xmath2 , there seems to be some controversy on whether they have a significant dark matter component @xcite . a recent paper claims to have discovered globular clusters dominated by dark matter @xcite . ]    at the scale of galaxy clusters ( @xmath3 ) , the virial theorem is used ( assuming virialization of the galaxies and gas within the cluster ) to infer the mass distribution within the cluster from the distribution of the radial velocities of member galaxies @xcite , and the temperature and density distributions of the hot gases ( the intracluster medium ( icm ) ) measured by x - ray satellite observatories @xcite .",
    "strong and weak gravitational lensing also provide independent measurements of the cluster s mass @xcite .",
    "these determinations of the dynamical masses of the galaxy clusters disagree with their visible masses , giving rise to the so - called virial discrepancy .    at the cosmological scale ( @xmath4 )",
    ", the amount of dark matter in the universe can be inferred from the positions and heights of the acoustic peaks in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy data @xcite .",
    "the most popular model which is consistent with various cosmological structure formation constraints is the one in which a non - zero cosmological constant @xmath0 ( dark energy ) is assumed in addition to the existence of collisionless cold dark matter ( cdm ) @xcite however , the @xmath0cdm paradigm is not without its problems at and below the galactic scale . in particular ,",
    "@xmath5-body simulations of cdm evolution @xcite predict a ` cusp ' in the dark matter distribution toward the galactic center whereas observations indicate the presence of a ` core , ' i.e. the ` core / cusp problem ' @xcite .",
    "an alternative to the introduction of dark matter to explain the discrepancy between the visible and inferred masses would be to modify the laws of gravity .",
    "the most prominent of such approaches is modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) of @xcite . in mond ,",
    "the equation of motion is modified from @xmath6 to @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the critical acceleration . ] which separates the two regions of behavior .",
    "the two regions are connected by an interpolating function @xmath9 where @xmath10",
    "the choice of interpolating functions @xmath11 is arbitrary , and an often used functional form is @xmath12 for a given ( baryonic ) source mass @xmath13 , its gravitational attraction on a test mass @xmath14 is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the usual newtonian acceleration without dark matter .",
    "then the above modification to the equation of motion implies @xmath17 on the outskirts of galaxies , this implies @xmath18 leading to flat rotation curves as well as the baryonic tully - fisher relation @xcite @xmath19 the most amazing thing about the mond approach is that it succeeds in fitting the rotation curves of a large set of galaxies with the single universal parameter @xmath8 which is consistently found to be @xcite @xmath20 other studies of mond in the context of rotation curves include @xcite .",
    "given that the hubble parameter is @xmath21/c \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( see table 4 of @xcite ) it has been noted that @xmath22 suggesting that mond may have cosmological origins @xcite .",
    "the application of mond to galaxy clusters has been less successful .",
    "@xcite shows that assuming the value of @xmath8 found from galactic rotation curves , fitting mond to galaxy clusters does reduce the virial discrepancy , but not sufficiently so , mainly due to large portions of the clusters remaining in the @xmath23 regime .",
    "mond also has difficulty explaining the weak gravitational lensing of the bullet cluster @xcite .",
    "thus , even with mond , the introduction of dark matter may be unavoidable at cluster scales , which negates the original motivation for mond .      if one is to stay within the dark matter paradigm , the uncanny success of mond at galactic scales , where collisionless cdm has problems , makes one ponder whether it would be possible to combine the salient features of mond and cdm into a new framework of dark matter .    from the relativistic point of view",
    ", the choice between the introduction of dark matter and the modification of gravity amounts to which side of einstein s equation , @xmath24 one chooses to modify .",
    "the same terms could be interpreted differently depending on which side of the equation one places it , e.g. vacuum energy vs. cosmological constant . thus if a particular modification works on the left - hand - side ( a relativistic extension of mond , for example )",
    ", one could move it to the right - hand - side and reinterpret it as due to a new type of dark matter .",
    "this is also evident in the non - relativistic mond equation , eq .",
    "( [ mond - eqm ] ) , when rewritten as @xmath25 interpreting @xmath13 as the mass of baryonic matter enclosed within a sphere of radius @xmath26 , one could write the left - hand - side as @xmath27 and interpret @xmath28   \\;\\equiv\\ ; m f_\\mathrm{mond}(a / a_c ) \\ ; , \\label{fdef}\\ ] ] as the mass of non - baryonic dark matter enclosed within the same sphere .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ mond - eqm2 ] ) can be written as @xmath29 \\;=\\ ; a\\;. \\label{mond - eqm3}\\ ] ] solving this equation for the acceleration @xmath30 will also determine @xmath31 .",
    "the dark matter distribution determined in this fashion would precisely reproduce the results of mond without modifying inertia or the law of gravity .",
    "note , however , that this type of dark matter can be expected to be quite different from any other type of dark matter heretofore considered , be it cold , warm , hot , or mixed .",
    "first , @xmath32 is proportional to @xmath13 , so the dark matter must track the baryonic matter .",
    "second , @xmath32 is dependent on @xmath8 .",
    "this can be interpreted as due to the dark matter being knowledgable about the hubble parameter @xmath33 .",
    "third , the dependence on @xmath30 , which must be introduced to cancel the dimensions of @xmath8 by taking the ratio @xmath34 , but is a parameter that must be determined by solving the equation of motion , means that the dark matter distribution is closely linked to the consistency of the dynamics .",
    "as far as the knowledge of @xmath35 is concerned , @xcite have argued that the acceleration scale @xmath36 may arise naturally within cdm models if one considers the energy dissipation ( cooling ) and collapse of baryonic matter into the central regions within galactic cdm haloes ( which do not collapse ) .",
    "because of the baryonic collapse , gravity in the central regions of galaxies is dominated by baryonic gravity , while that in the outskirts is dominated by cdm gravity . due to the scaling properties of this process , @xmath36",
    "is argued to set a universal scale at which this transition occurs . for clusters , on the other hand ,",
    "gravity is everywhere cdm dominated and this transition does not occur , explaining the failure of mond . in the @xcite approach ,",
    "therefore , the cdm obtains information on @xmath36 from the simple fact that it is evolving in a universe expanding at the rate of @xmath37 , whereas the coincidence @xmath38 is more of a numerical accident . and even with this knowledge , cdm has problems at the galactic scale as mentioned above .",
    "if a dark - matter model is to reproduce the success of mond , two questions must be answered :    1 .",
    "what should the function @xmath39 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ mond - eqm3 ] ) be ? 2 .",
    "what dynamics must the dark - matter have to reproduce such a mass distribution ?    beginning with the first question , the asymptotics of the mond interpolating function @xmath11 only demand @xmath40 which is not much of a constraint .",
    "also , though we are trying to reverse engineer mond , one eventually wishes to predict mondian behavior from a dark - matter model based on fundamental principles .",
    "first and foremost , the dark matter must know about @xmath41 via some fundamental principle and not by accident . to this end , @xcite used standard gravitational thermodynamics , and verlinde s idea of entropic gravity @xcite , to argue that in a de sitter space with cosmological constant @xmath0 , the equation of motion should read @xmath42 \\;=\\ ; \\sqrt{a^2 + a_0 ^ 2 } - a_0^{\\phantom{1 } } \\ ; , \\label{mdm - eqm}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 is given by the cosmological constant @xmath0 as @xmath45 despite its appearance , eq .",
    "( [ mdm - eqm ] ) does not modify general relativity ( gr ) since the derivation of the right - hand - side is based on gr .",
    "the information on @xmath46 is conveyed to the dark - matter via the temperature of the de sitter horizon .",
    "@xcite dubbed the hypothetical dark matter which satisfies eq .",
    "( [ mdm - eqm ] ) ` mondian dark matter ' ( mdm ) , but the equation of motion is distinct from eq .  ( [ mond - eqm3 ] ) . unfortunately the name conjured among the community the idea that mdm was a hybrid theory , which it is not .",
    "we therefore choose to rename the model ` modified dark matter ' ( mdm , same acronym ) to clarify that it is a dark - matter model , albeit an exotic one .    as the mdm distribution function , @xcite chose @xmath47 which goes to zero in the limit @xmath48 , and reproduces the flat galactic rotation curves .",
    "note that @xmath49 and not @xmath50 as in eq .",
    "( [ fmondasymp ] ) .",
    "as we will show in section 2 , this form is suggested by the heuristic arguments based on gravitational thermodynamics presented in section 2 .",
    "this choice is , of course , arbitrary and a case of reverse engineering .",
    "@xcite proposed that quanta which obey infinite statistics @xcite may exhibit the necessary dynamics to predict such behavior , but the details have yet to be worked out .",
    "we note in passing , however , that quanta of infinite statistics can not be expressed as excitations of a local quantum field theory ( qft ) and are intrinsically ` non - local ' in nature , indicating that they have at least one feature that may be required of mdm .    despite lacking a dynamical theory , which precludes performing numerical simulations , @xcite confronted the proposed mdm distribution with galactic rotation curves to see if it has merit from the phenomenological point of view .",
    "it was found that the mdm distribution does indeed provide a good fit to the data , and with a single fitting parameter ( the mass to luminosity ratio of the galaxy ) as opposed to three ( two of which are correlated ) for the well - known dark matter mass profile of @xcite ( nfw ) .",
    "this could indicate some hidden structure connected to the cosmological constant within the cdm mass profiles .    in this paper , we seek to extend our investigation of mdm to galaxy clusters .",
    ".  ( [ fmdm1 ] ) is not expected to work , given that it closely resembles mond which does not work either .",
    "we therefore begin by seeking a generalization of eq .",
    "( [ fmdm1 ] ) which also places the expression onto a firmer theoretical footing .",
    "we then confront the galaxy cluster data to demonstrate the merit of the improved / generalized mdm distribution functions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ mdmprofile ]",
    "we review our derivation of eq .",
    "( [ mdm - eqm ] ) , based on gravitational thermodynamics , and provide a theoretical justification for the mdm profile proposed by @xcite and studied by @xcite , albeit with a slight rescaling . in section  [ galaxyclusterfits ] ,",
    "we generalize the mdm mass profile to account for galaxy cluster data as well as galactic rotation curves and confront the new distribution with the virial mass profiles of 13 low - redshift , relaxed galaxy clusters .",
    "section 4 is devoted to summary and discussion . in the appendix we present the successful fit of the generalized mdm mass profile to galactic rotation curves .",
    "we find that the mdm mass profile is sensitive to the cosmological constant on both the cluster and galactic scales .",
    "this in turn may constrain the nature of cdm .",
    "as mentioned above , the missing mass problem in the context of einstein s equation @xmath51 can be solved in two ways : change the source @xmath52 by adding a new energy - momentum tensor , or change the einstein tensor @xmath53 .",
    "cdm is an example of the first option , one in which the extra energy momentum tensor is independent of the original baryonic tensor .",
    "the second option is a modification of gravity .",
    "modifications to inertia , such as in milgrom s scaling , should naturally emerge from this second option ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , one could also recast einstein s equation such that the energy - momentum part contains the cosmological constant term , @xmath54 , and the question arises whether the cdm mass profiles could know about the cosmological constant .",
    "this is the idea of modified dark matter ( mdm ) .",
    "given the nature of the cosmological constant problem , the mdm approach should , at heart , be based on quantum gravity . however , quantum gravity is a very difficult problem ; so our proposal is to look at the thermodynamic reformulation of einstein s theory and search for a commensurate modification of the energy momentum tensor that accounts for the cosmological constant .",
    "the reason for this is that gravitational thermodynamics ( the prototype of which is black hole thermodynamics ) is the only place where quantum theory and physics in accelerating frames are ( currently ) precisely related .      in presenting this idea",
    "we follow the approach of @xcite .",
    "we consider a local observer with acceleration @xmath30 in a spatially flat de sitter space ( i.e. one dominated by a positive cosmological constant @xmath0 , in which @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) . in such a space , the thermodynamic relation @xmath57 has @xmath58 as the unruh temperature associated with the local accelerating ( rindler ) observer @xcite @xmath59 the acceleration @xmath30 can be interpreted as surface gravity on the associated ( rindler ) horizon .",
    "the entropy @xmath60 is then associated with the area of this horizon @xmath61 and the energy @xmath62 is the integral of the energy momentum tensor @xmath63 where @xmath64 are appropriate unit vectors .    the link between this thermodynamic equation and einstein s equations is given by the raychaudhuri equation . for an instantaneously stationary local rindler horizon",
    "the shear and vorticity terms can be neglected , effectively leaving : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the appropriate affine parameter and @xmath67 are the unit tangent vectors to the appropriate geodesic whose cross sectional area @xmath68 is being focused .    taking the above expressions , along with the expressions for the hawking - unruh temperature @xmath58 and the bekenstein - hawking entropy @xmath60 , it then follows that @xmath69 and thus that @xmath70 .",
    "the local divergenceless of @xmath52 then sets @xmath71 ( via the bianchi identity ) , and we recover einstein s equations .",
    "even the correct factor of @xmath72 comes from the factor of @xmath73 , the periodicity of the euclidean time in the temperature formula , and the @xmath74 from the entropy formula .",
    "the local acceleration , @xmath30 , in this context just sets the correct units between the entropy and energy .",
    "our modification to jacobson s argument is to _ introduce a fundamental acceleration that is related to the cosmological constant_. since we wish to preserve the holographic scaling of the area ( to remain consistent with einstein s theory ) _ and _ still have a standard energy - momentum tensor , we are compelled to change something in the thermodynamic expression that can be interpreted both from the point of view of inertia and from the point of view of a mass source",
    ". we must therefore preserve the entropy but change the temperature such that the additional part of the energy momentum tensor `` knows '' about the inertial properties that temperature knows about .",
    "this corresponds to a change in equation  ( [ firstlaw ] ) such that the change in temperature amounts to a particular change in energy that leaves the entropy unchanged .",
    "the constancy of the entropy @xmath75 is a form of infinitesimal adiabaticity .",
    "to change the temperature we turn to our local observer with acceleration @xmath30 in de sitter space , and thus with total acceleration @xmath76 ( where @xmath77 ) .",
    "the unruh temperature experienced by this observer is @xcite @xmath78 however , since de sitter space has a cosmological horizon , it has a horizon temperature associated with @xmath44 .",
    "we thus define the following _ effective _ temperature , so that for zero acceleration we get zero temperature @xmath79 this reduces to the usual temperature for rindler observers by neglecting @xmath44 .",
    "note that @xmath80 our model is thus : @xmath81 in which @xmath75 remains unchanged and where we define , in analogy with the normalized temperature @xmath82 , the normalized energy @xmath83 therefore , energy is not changed in an arbitrary way , but instead in accordance with the change in temperature that should be fixed by the background .",
    "if we now require that @xmath84 , so that we have _ locally _ what einstein s theory would give in the newtonian limit , then we have , at least from the point of view of the temperature , milgrom s scaling .",
    "there is , however , a key advance in our argument : milgrom s scaling emerges as the difference between the temperature of an accelerated observer in de sitter space and the background temperature of the cosmological horizon , in the limit of accelerations small compared to the acceleration associated with the surface gravity of the cosmological horizon .",
    "milgrom s scaling ( mond ) ( @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) sets the value of @xmath8 from the hubble scale ; @xmath44 is related to milgrom s critical acceleration @xmath8 as @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "how does this argument relate to the idea of ` missing ' mass ?",
    "it follows from equation  ( [ deftilde ] ) that @xmath88 where the entropy @xmath60 is still given by equation  ( [ hbek ] ) , so that the einstein tensor is untouched . however , due to the change in temperature the energy is changed .",
    "if we rewrite the temperature as @xmath89 where the @xmath58 part corresponds to the unruh temperature of the observer moving with the newtonian acceleration @xmath90 ( in the correspondence limit @xmath91 ) , then we can also write @xmath92 if we interpret the original @xmath93 as corresponding to baryonic matter , then @xmath94 thus the energy momentum tensor of the extra sources ( which we will identify with missing mass ) has to be related to the energy momentum tensor of ordinary visible matter ( via equation  ( [ intgr ] ) ) .",
    "finally , by expanding the formula for the de sitter temperature we have a relation between the energy momentum tensors of the dark ( prime ) and visible ( unprime ) matter @xmath95 which for energy density ( i.e. the @xmath96 components ) is @xmath97 the @xmath32 in the above expression is what we call ` dark matter . '",
    "this dark matter profile is similar to the one in our original papers on mdm @xcite , but with the appearance of the factor of @xmath98 as opposed to the original @xmath99 ( which was motivated by the tully - fisher relation ) .",
    "the exact forms , without any expansion , are @xmath100 and @xmath101 respectively .",
    "this gives rise to the idea of ` entropic force ' , where : @xmath102 and @xmath103 respectively .",
    "our dark matter mass profile thus `` knows '' about the visible matter as well as the cosmological background , and it also knows about the inertial properties of the moving masses in that background , since it is directly tied to the visible matter , the cosmological constant @xmath104 , and the inertial properties ( acceleration @xmath30 ) .",
    "in essence , we have a vacuum origin of the fundamental acceleration and also a quantum origin of the mass profile that could lead to the observed galactic rotation curves . from our perspective ,",
    "flat galactic rotation curves are a quantum gravity effect at large scales .",
    "in principle , the above mass profile , eq .",
    "( [ fmdm2 ] ) , fixed by the ratio of the corresponding unruh - hawking temperatures ( in the limit of small @xmath105 ) can be modified due to some well - known physical effects associated with a change of scale .",
    "for example , the temperature can be changed via the tolman - ehrenfest formula @xcite @xmath106 where the @xmath107 is essentially determined by the gravitational potential @xmath108 , @xmath109 ( in the units @xmath110 ) , and the dimensionful factor @xmath111 is determined by the boundary conditions of the problem .",
    "the questions are what gravitational potential should be used in our case and what sets the value of @xmath111 . for example , for a constant background gravitational field ,",
    "i.e. the linear potential , we are led to consider the following modification of the mass profile : @xmath112}\\left(\\dfrac{a_0}{a}\\right)^2 \\;,\\ ] ] where the dimensionless factor @xmath113 is really determined by the ratio of dimensionful @xmath111 at different scales ( in our case , the cluster and galactic scales ) .",
    "it is interesting that the same prefactor can be obtained in the context of conformal gravity by rewriting the frw cosmological line element in the schwarschild coordinate system ( the linear potential also being the direct analogue of the newtonian potential for conformal gravity ; see @xcite ) .",
    "note that the prefactor @xmath114 $ ] is only the leading term in a more general expression that involves higher order terms in @xmath26 .    regarding the value of @xmath113 we note that the boundary value of the temperature is set by the ratio @xmath115 , which scales as distance squared , because @xmath116 .",
    "thus , in principle , @xmath113 can increase with distance .",
    "however , our argument is too heuristic to determine the form of this scaling .    in what follows",
    "we show that the mass profile given in equation  [ clustermassp ] very nicely fits the cluster data and reproduces the relevant virial mass profile , with @xmath117 and @xmath118  kpc .",
    "however , on galactic scales , given our previous successful fits of the galactic rotation curves , @xmath119 and also @xmath26 is much smaller than @xmath120 .",
    "thus , in going from the galactic to the cluster scales , @xmath113 needs to change by two orders of magnitude .",
    "this is not completely unrealistic , given our heuristic thermodynamic reasoning , but we have to admit of being ignorant of the underlying reason for this .",
    "we compare mdm mass profiles with the observed ( virial ) mass profiles in a sample of 13 relaxed galaxy clusters given in @xcite .",
    "this sample was chosen for several reasons .",
    "firstly , they analyzed all available _ chandra _ data which were of sufficient quality to determine mass profiles robustly out to large radii ( @xmath121 and extended past @xmath122 in five clusters ) , spanning a temperature range of 0.7  9  kev .",
    "this provides us with a significant sample size with data covering radii from the inner , cooling region out to the virial radius .",
    "secondly , their fitting models were given enough degrees of freedom to get very accurate data fits , which allows us to compare mdm mass profiles to these very accurate models .",
    "thirdly , whenever possible , data from two different x - ray observatories , _ chandra _ and rosat , were compared and combined in order to ensure that derived cluster brightness profiles agree in the overlapping regions . at large radii , the _ chandra _ field of view limits the statistical accuracy of surface brightness profiles . to overcome this problem , @xcite combined rosat - pspc and @xmath123 data in cases where the pspc observations were sufficiently deep ( see table  [ tab : clusters ] , adapted from @xcite ) .",
    "the main goals of the analysis were to extract accurate temperature profiles and surface brightness profiles out to a large fraction of the virial radius .",
    "spectral analysis to obtain temperature profiles is presented in @xcite , and details of the x - ray surface brightness profiles is presented in @xcite .",
    "the observed mass profiles are inferred from temperature ( @xmath58 ) and gas density ( @xmath124 ) measurements assuming spherical symmetry and hydrostatic equilibrium @xcite : @xmath125 where @xmath126 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath127 is the mass of a proton , and @xmath128 is the mean molecular weight for a plasma with primordial abundances .    the vast majority of the baryons in galaxy clusters are contained in a hot , diffuse gas ( @xmath129k and densities @xmath130  particles per cubic centimeter ) . in such conditions , the primary emission process is due to thermal _",
    "bremsstrahlung_. recombination of electrons with heavier elements also contributes to the x - ray spectrum allowing for meaurements of the ionization and chemcial abundances of the plasma . the traditional model for the gas density in galaxy clusters",

    "the gas mass density is then given by @xmath136 for the plasma with primordial helium abundance and a metalicity of @xmath137 for heavier elements .",

    "while function parameter errors were not reported , inspection of their figures 3  15 indicate that 10% is a reasonable estimate .",
    "they also mention in the text that monte carlo simulations suggest statistical errors in gas density determinations of @xmath142 .    for comparison ,",
