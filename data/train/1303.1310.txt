    "<S> . we will show in this letter that the exchange coupling constants from first principles corroborate that zncu@xmath0(oh)@xmath1cl@xmath2 is a near perfect realization of a kagom antiferromagnet with a dominant coupling of @xmath22  k. however , there are small corrections to this picture : a next - nearest neighbour coupling in the kagom layer of @xmath4 and in particular some interplanar couplings between @xmath5 and @xmath23 could actually be relevant for the nature and excitations of the spin liquid ground state in herbertsmithite .    we perform density functional theory calculations with the full potential local orbital ( fplo ) basis set  @xcite using generalized gradient approximation ( gga )  @xcite and gga+u functionals . </S>",
    "<S> the exchange couplings , @xmath24 , are obtained from total energy calculations for different cu spin configurations in supercells of various sizes  @xcite . before proceeding to herbertsmithite , we test our methods on kapellasite , a polymorph of herbertsmithite , which has been investigated before , both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we use the structure of kapellasite as given in ref .   and determine the hydrogen position by relaxation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the structure is shown in figure  [ fig : kapellasite ] . </S>",
    "<S> we create two different supercells : a @xmath25 supercell with @xmath26 symmetry and 10 inequivalent cu positions with the purpose of resolving four interlayer couplings , and a @xmath27 supercell with @xmath28 symmetry that provides symmetry inequivalent 3rd nearest neighbours in the kagom plane . using gga+u with @xmath29  ev and @xmath30  ev , we find two significant couplings , @xmath31  k and @xmath32  k ( see table  [ tab : jkapellasite221u6 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> . other couplings like @xmath12 are significantly smaller ( around 1  k ) , and we find interlayer couplings to be negligible ( see appendix  [ appa ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the numbers we give are converged to sub - kelvin precision with our choice of spin configurations ; however , different sets of spin configurations will lead to slightly different values so that we estimate the uncertainty of the exchange constants for both compounds discussed in this work to be around 1  k. systematic studies on the influence of the choice of exchange and correlation functional and other technical variations in the dft determination of exchange couplings have been performed by some of us in refs .  . </S>",
    "<S> table  [ tab : jkapellasite221u6 ] is in very good agreement with the observation of ref .   that experimental data are compatible with a @xmath3-@xmath11 model with @xmath33  k and @xmath34  k. note that the ratio between @xmath3 and @xmath11 depends on the choice of @xmath35 as the antiferromagnetic @xmath11 in particular is inversely proportional to @xmath35 ( see appendix  [ appa ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> even more recently , the high temperature series expansion method was refined to fit both magnetic susceptibility and specific heat data , yielding the set of parameters @xmath36  k , @xmath37  k , @xmath38  k  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we can proceed with some confidence to analyze the heisenberg hamiltonian parameters of herbertsmithite .    </S>",
    "<S> we use the structure of zncu@xmath0(oh)@xmath1cl@xmath2 ( herbertsmithite ) with @xmath39 space group determined by shores _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite which is shown in figure  [ fig : structure ]  ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> a big difference with respect to the polymorph kapellasite is that zn is now between kagom layers rather than in the centers of its hexagons . in figure  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bsdos ] , we present the bandstructure and density of states . at the fermi level , we find cu @xmath40 states which hybridize with o @xmath41 and cl @xmath42 states . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , zn plays no role at @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the dirac - point - like feature at @xmath44 for an energy of 0.2  ev above the fermi level becomes an avoided crossing with a tiny gap in a fully relativistic calculation . </S>",
    "<S> based on our experience with azurite , another complex quantum spin system containing cu@xmath45 ions  @xcite and the fact that kapellasite , the polymorph of herbertsmithite briefly analyzed above , was shown to have longer ranged competing interactions  @xcite , we determine all exchange constants up to cu - cu distances of 8.6   . in order to allow for determination of the diagonal coupling in the kagom lattice , @xmath18 , we double the unit cell along * a * and prepare a structure with @xmath46 space group and 12 inequivalent cu sites . as appropriate for cu , we employ a gga+u exchange correlation functional with @xmath29  ev , @xmath30  ev and atomic - limit double - counting correction  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> total energies for nine different spin configurations allow us to calculate the eight exchange coupling constants listed in table  [ tab : j ] . </S>",
    "<S> the three couplings within the kagom layer are shown in figure  [ fig : structure ]  ( b ) , and the geometry of the three most important interlayer couplings is presented in figure  [ fig : structure ]  ( c)-(e ) . to avoid confusion , we number the coupling constants @xmath24 strictly according to ascending cu - cu distances . </S>",
    "<S> while the absolute values of the exchange constants obtained from these calculations are dependent on the choice of the @xmath35 value in the gga+u calculations , as already pointed out for kapellasite , one expects that the antiferromagnetic exchange constants follow a @xmath47 law while the ferromagnetic exchange constants should be less sensitive to the @xmath35 value . </S>",
    "<S> this trend is also observed in the case of herbertsmithite when we compare the exchange constants obtained for @xmath29  ev , @xmath48  ev and @xmath49  ev ( see appendix  [ appb ] ) . in order to have also a quantitative description of the exchange constants and not only ratios , we take as reference the results obtained for @xmath29  ev , guided by the experience with other copper - based materials as mentioned above .    within the kagom layer , </S>",
    "<S> the most important correction to the presently discussed hamiltonian for herbertsmithite is the next - nearest - neighbour coupling @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical investigations of the kagom lattice with nearest and next - nearest neighbour interactions indicate that the nature of the spin liquid ground state could depend on such a next nearest coupling  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> messio _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have even extended the range of the couplings to the 3rd nearest neighbour across a hexagon ; our set of parameters would put herbertsmithite in the @xmath50 spin liquid phase , in agreement with ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> very recently , the heisenberg model on the kagom lattice with nearest and next - nearest neighbour couplings has been studied with a pseudofermion functional renormalization group method  @xcite ; very good agreement with the inelastic neutron scattering experiment of ref .   is reached for the next nearest neighbour interaction in the plane @xmath51 which is very close to our value .    </S>",
    "<S> now we come to the interlayer couplings . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , it is important to note that while each cu site has four interactions via @xmath3 , four via @xmath17 and six via @xmath18 , the interlayer bonds are numerous : there are four @xmath12 bonds , six @xmath9 bonds , eight @xmath19 bonds , six @xmath20 bonds and six @xmath21 bonds . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we find @xmath12 to be an antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling of size @xmath23 , and @xmath19 a ferromagnetic interlayer coupling of size @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> previous studies based on the spin - rotation - invariant green s function method showed that a stacked kagom system remains short - range ordered independent of the sign and strength of the interlayer coupling  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have performed a first test of the relevance of the interlayer couplings for susceptibility and specific heat using high temperature series expansion  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this method has been very useful to discuss the kagom lattice heisenberg model  @xcite as well as various additional terms  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that at least in the region of applicability of this method the effect of interlayer couplings is noticeable . </S>",
    "<S> we hope that our results inspire more precise manybody calculations that could establish the consequences of interlayer couplings for the low temperature properties of herbertsmithite .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> our _ ab initio_-based analysis of the cu - cu exchange coupling constants in kapellasite and herbertsmithite provides a detailed description of these materials . </S>",
    "<S> our results for the dominant interactions are in excellent agreement with experiments . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we are able to resolve the strength and sign of weaker , but not negligible , exchange interactions that were not known up to now and are important for understanding the behavior of these materials at low temperatures . both polymorphs , even though they are realizations of a perfect kagom lattice , show a few remarkable differences . </S>",
    "<S> the nearest neighbor cu - cu exchange interaction is strongly antiferromagnetic in herbertsmithite ( @xmath8 k ) and weakly ferromagnetic in kapellasite ( @xmath52 k ) due to the fact that the cu - o - cu angle in herbertsmithite is @xmath53 compared to @xmath54 in kapellasite . </S>",
    "<S> kapellasite shows a significant antiferromagnetic 4th nearest neighbor coupling along the diagonal of the cu hexagon ( @xmath11 ) which is negligible in herbertsmithite since the exchange path in kapellasite is through the in - plane zn situated in the center of the hexagons . also , the stacking of the kagom layers in both polymorphs is crucial for understanding the interlayer exchange couplings . in kapellasite , </S>",
    "<S> the kagom layers are stacked in a similar fashion as in the layered tiocl  @xcite or cs@xmath2cucl@xmath55  @xcite where interactions are mostly of van der waals nature . in this situation , </S>",
    "<S> the interlayer couplings are comparatively small ( see appendix  [ appb ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in herbertsmithite the interlayer cu - cu couplings are partly through zn orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to relatively significant antiferromagnetic ( @xmath12 ) and ferromagnetic ( @xmath19 ) interlayer couplings . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the ratio between the dominant intralayer coupling @xmath3 and the dominant interlayer coupling remains large enough for this system to be considered a very good realization of a two - dimensional kagom lattice and only at low temperatures should the smaller @xmath24 become important . </S>",
    "<S> this and the importance of couplings other than the dominant ones for the spin - liquid behavior in these materials should be investigated in the future . in particular , it would be interesting to determine also the couplings of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya and ring exchange terms in the hamiltonian from first principles .    </S>",
