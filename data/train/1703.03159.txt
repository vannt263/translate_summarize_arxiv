    "in the last several years high - index dielectric nanoparticles and nanostructures  @xcite proved to be a promising platform for various nanophotonic applications , in particular for the design of functional nanoantennas  @xcite , enhanced spontaneous emission  @xcite , photovoltaics  @xcite , frequency conversion  @xcite , raman scattering  @xcite , and sensing  @xcite .",
    "the great interest in such nanostructures is caused mainly by their ability to control the electric and magnetic components of light at the nanoscale  @xcite , while exhibiting low dissipative losses inherent to the materials with a negligible concentration of free charges  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been demonstrated that nanoantennas composed of high - index nanoparticles have the ability to realize directional scattering of the incident light and to effectively transform the near field of feeding quantum sources into propagating electromagnetic waves  @xcite .",
    "modification of the spontaneous emission rate of a quantum emitter induced by its environment , known as the purcell effect  @xcite , is not so pronounced in all - dielectric structures  @xcite , as in microcavities  @xcite or plasmonic nanoantennas  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that optical resonances of high - index nanoparticles are characterized by relatively low quality factors and large mode volumes , which results in low efficiency of light - matter interaction .",
    "however , it was recently shown that this disadvantage can be overcome by relying on the van hove singularity of a chain of high - index nanoparticles  @xcite .",
    "such approach allows to substantially enhance the local density of optical states ( ldos ) at the location of a quantum source and thus achieve high values of the purcell factor with relatively small dielectric nanostructures while leaving unaltered all their other advantages .",
    "high - index dielectric nanostructures are also of a special interest for nonlinear nanophotonics , because they can exhibit strong nonlinear responses .",
    "it was recently predicted and experimentally demonstrated that photoexcitation of dense electron - hole plasma ( ehp ) in silicon ( si ) nanoparticles  @xcite and nanodimers  @xcite by femtosecond laser ( fs - laser ) pulses is accompanied by a dramatic modification of the radiation properties , whereas generation of ehp in germanium nanoantennas can even turn them into plasmonic ones in the mid - ir region  @xcite .",
    "here , we propose a highly tunable all - dielectric nanoantenna , consisting of a chain of si nanoparticles excited by an electric dipole source , which allows for tuning its radiation properties via electron - hole plasma photoexcitation .",
    "we theoretically and numerically demonstrate the tuning of radiation power patterns and purcell factor by pumping several boundary nanoparticles in the chain with relatively low peak intensities of fs - laser pulses .",
    "moreover , we show that the proposed nanoantenna , being driven by fs - laser pulses , allows unidirectional launching of surface plasmon waves ( fig .",
    "[ concept ] ) , making this solution attractive for all - optical light manipulation systems .",
    "to briefly recall the origin of the _ van hove singularity _",
    ", let us consider a general periodic one - dimensional system supporting a set of guided modes . decomposing its green tensor into a series of eigenmodes",

    "the divergence of the purcell factor , occurring at the point of zero group velocity , is known as a van hove singularity .",
    "this expression clearly suggests that the purcell factor benefits from slow light modes of the structure . in reality",
    ", its finite size prevents this divergence , but nevertheless largely enhanced purcell factor can still be traced to the van hove singularity of the original structure .    ) of waveguiding modes in the infinite dielectric chain .",

    "we choose si particles with dielectric permittivity @xmath6 close to 16 in the operational frequency range  @xcite .",
    "the nanoparticles have all the same radius @xmath7 and the center - to - center distance between neighboring particles is @xmath8 .",
    "the optical properties of nanoparticle - based nanoantennas can be understood from the infinite chain modal dispersion  @xcite .",
    "therefore we start by calculating the optical properties of the infinite structure with an analytical approach , based on the well - known coupled - dipole model .",
    "each particle is modeled as a combination of magnetic and electric dipoles with magnetic @xmath9 and electric @xmath10 momenta , oscillating with frequency @xmath11 [ @xmath12 . in the cgs system",
    "this approach leads to the linear system of equations : @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the dyadic product , @xmath17 is the unit @xmath18 tensor , @xmath19 is the unit vector in the direction from @xmath20-th to @xmath21-th sphere , and @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the distance between the centers of @xmath20-th and @xmath21-th spheres , @xmath24 is the permittivity of the host medium , @xmath25 is the host wavenumber , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the frequency .",

    "the blue and red curves correspond to transverse magnetic ( tm ) and transverse electric ( te ) modes , respectively , which are the only modes excited by the dipole source with the chosen orientation .",
    "both of these modes are characterized by induced magnetic and electric moments ( except the points at the band edge ) . due to the spectral separation of resonances of the single particle , the magnetic moments are dominant in the first branch ( tm ) , and electric moments in the second one ( te ) .",

    "it can be seen that the group velocity @xmath3 drops to zero at the band edge around @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "since the symmetry of the ed source matches the symmetry of the tm staggered mode ( and not the te one ) , we may expect significant enhancement of the purcell factor for a finite system around the first frequency .    to confirm this expectation",
    ", we calculate the purcell factor using the green s tensor approach  @xcite : @xmath40\\cdot { \\bf{z}}\\ ] ] with @xmath41 being green s tensor of an electric dipole in the center of chain ( point of the dipole source localization ) and @xmath42 being the unit vector pointing in the @xmath43 direction ( fig .",

    "we observe that increasing the number of nanoparticles @xmath5 gives rise to enhancement of purcell factor .",
    "for example , the maximal value of the purcell factor for @xmath48 reaches 250 .",
    "along with the calculations shown in fig .",

    "our aim is to utilize this effect to engineer highly tunable nanoantennas , for which relatively low intensities of external laser pulses can control and cause a dramatic modification of the optical properties of the material , and consequently the radiation properties ( intensities of emission and power patterns ) of the nanoantenna . to enable the switching of the nanoantenna properties we employ the nonlinear response caused by _ electron - hole plasma photoexcitation _ the in boundary particles of the si nanoantenna .",
    "to describe ehp - induced tuning of the nanoantenna , we employ the analytical approach developed in ref .",
    "the dynamics of volume - averaged ehp density @xmath50 is modeled via the rate equation @xmath51 where , @xmath52 are the volume - averaged absorption rates due to one- and two - photon processes , and @xmath53 is the ehp recombination rate which depends on ehp density  @xcite .",
    "the absorption rates are written in the usual form as @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where angle brackets denote averaging over the nanoparticle volume , and @xmath56 with @xmath37 being two - photon absorption coefficient .",
    "the relaxation rate of ehp in c - si is dominated by auger recombination @xmath57 with @xmath58  s@xmath59@xmath60 ( ref .",

    "the decrease of the purcell factor approximately by a factor of 2 in all cases ( i  iii ) , along with the spectral broadening , are caused by symmetry breaking of the chain and corresponding decrease of the quality factor of the van hove singularity mode .",
    "the ehp photoexcitation also modifies the radiation pattern of the nanoantenna , fig .  [",

    "for example , in the case of @xmath5=8  [ fig .",
    "[ 3fig](b)iii ] , the directivity in the left direction is two times larger that in the right one .",

    "these spectra qualitatively agree with our analytical calculations presented above .",

    "moreover , the numerical calculations reveal that the sharpest effect of ehp photoexcitation on the radiation pattern manifests itself when three boundary particles are illuminated [ see inset in the fig .",

    "silicon has a particularly large tpa coefficient between 600 and 700 nm  @xcite .",
    "we set the wavelength of pump pulse to 650 nm in order to avoid the interference between pump and dipole source signals . estimating the enhancement factors for @xmath79 and @xmath80 for a si nanoparticle on a substrate and using equations ( [ plasma ] ) to calculate the dynamics of ehp density , we find that a 200 fs pulse with peak intensity of 35  gw/@xmath81 and 25  gw/@xmath81 provides @xmath78 @xmath71 ehp in the nanoparticle on a glass and silver substrates , respectively , during @xmath82 ps that should be sufficient for obtaining the degree of tuning demonstrated above .",
