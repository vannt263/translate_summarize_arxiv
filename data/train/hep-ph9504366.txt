    "three jet production in @xmath3 annihilation was investigated in details at petra and later at tristan energies @xcite in connection with the critical tests of perturbative qcd . in particular",
    "the difference between energy spectra of quark and gluon jets and quark and gluon jet multiplicities provided important information for quantitative tests of quantum chromodynamics .    besides the studies of hadronic final state as a result of direct @xmath4 annihilation , the measurement of the two photon processes @xmath5 at petra and tristan shows high physics potential .",
    "new tests are possible in lep experiments , especially the precise meauserement of the photon structure function and hadron production at high @xmath0 @xcite    at present time new experimental possibilities connected with the generation of @xmath6 beams by compton backscattering of the laser beam on a high energy electron beam @xcite are discussed extensively @xcite .",
    "investigation of the jet phenomena in @xmath7 collisions at the energy of several hundred gev is one of the most interesting questions for @xmath7 colliders phenomenology .    in this paper",
    "we discuss three jet production in the region of large @xmath0 originated from t - channel quark exchange between the colliding photons . at next linear colliders energy",
    "there are two other possible mechanisms for the jet production in high @xmath0 region with the cross sections of the same order @xcite : ( 1 ) gluon exchange between two pairs of quark jets ( 2 ) @xmath8 boson production .",
    "however , they have different final state topologies and can easily be distinguished from the mechanism under consideration . at smaller @xmath0",
    "the photon looks more like the hadron - like object and special treatment beyond the simple qcd tree approximation is necessary .",
    "the aims of this paper are the calculation of high @xmath0 quark and gluon jets energy spectra in @xmath7 collisions and comparison of the results with the @xmath3 case .",
    "the first order qcd calculation for three jet production in @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) gives the following well - known result for the spectra @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the energy fractions of quark , antiquark and gluon @xmath14 satisfying the equality @xmath15    distribution ( 1 ) defines the topology of the final state ( or topology of the primary process ) in @xmath3 collision . since quarks and gluons are unobservable , in the following various fragmentation models are used to generate real event samples .",
    "however , event generation will be beyond our analysis at present stage .",
    "the calculation in @xmath4 case for two feynman amplitudes only ( gluon is radiated from quark or antiquark leg ) is not technically difficult .",
    "in @xmath7 case we have 6 amplitudes represented in fig.1 .",
    "symbolic calculation for the corresponding 21 squared amplitudes could be more complicated . however , it is much simplified because the compact form of the result for the sum of 21 squared diagrams can be obtained @xcite : @xmath16 }              { \\prod_{i=1}^{3}\\,(p_ip_4)\\,(p_ip_5)}\\ ] ] we reproduced this formula using comphep package @xcite for generation of symbolic result and reduce system @xcite in the following algebraic transformations .    for the process",
    "@xmath17 we are using the kinematical variables    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the angle between particle 1 and particle 4 in the c.m.s . of ( 1,2 ) , @xmath20 is the helicity angle between the planes ( 1,4 ) and ( 3,4 ) in the c.m.s of ( 3,5 ) .",
    "the phase space in these variables takes the form    @xmath21    in the case of @xmath22 process the matrix element has collinear singuliarities only . in the case of @xmath23 process additional t - channel singuliarity appears .",
    "the denominator of the squared amplitude contains four momenta products ( see more details in the appendix )    @xmath24    where    @xmath25    integration over @xmath20 leads to the structures @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the denominator ( see more details in appendix ) . for this reason besides the poles of matrix element for the scattering in forward - backward directions ( no gluon emission from final quark ) there are parametrically dependent poles at    @xmath28    corresponding to the t - channel singuliarity in the diagrams with gluon emission from the quark leg .",
    "( in this case the antiquark is emitted in the opposite hemisphere at zero angle ) .",
    "while integrating over @xmath29 we introduced kinematical cuts @xmath30 and @xmath31 for quark near the forward pole and the poles defined by ( 13 ) .",

    "the cross section is an order of magnitude larger than for @xmath4 case .",
    "the shape of the spectra are similar .    in the case when there are no additional methods of quark and gluon jet identification the spectra are not measurable separately and the usual way of analysis is jet ordering in energy . in fig.3",
    "we show single differential spectra of quark and gluon jets in the case of @xmath4 and @xmath7 collisions . in the @xmath4 case quark and gluon",
    "jet spectra show large difference giving the possibility of good jet discrimination .",
    "for instance , about 70% of the jets at @xmath38 less than @xmath39 are gluon jets and about 50% of the jets at @xmath38 between @xmath40 and @xmath41 are quark jets . in the @xmath7 case",
    "the difference between the spectra is also well pronounced and identification possibilities of the quark and qluon jets by energy ordering seem not worse than for @xmath4 case .",
    "improvement of jet identification in some experimental situations could be provided by flavor tagging @xcite or comparison of @xmath42 and @xmath43 event topologies [ 1 ] .",
    "probably some combination of different methods can give optimal results .",
