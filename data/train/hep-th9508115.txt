    "the calogero - sutherland model describes interacting particles on a circle @xcite .",
    "recent interest in the model arose from its relation with the haldane - shastry chain ( @xmath3 ) and also with the random matrix theory .",
    "moreover , it has proven to be a good model to study fractional statistics",
    ".    there has been several works devoted to derive the correlation functions in the calogero - sutherland model @xcite . in particular , the density - density correlation functions were obtained . the green function where the annihilation operator acts before the creation operator was also computed . recently , zirnbauer and haldane obtained the green function with the creation operator acting first for the special values @xmath4 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we compute this green function in a simple way for all the rational values of @xmath0 using jack polynomial techniques .",
    "the method we use is closly related to our preceeding paper @xcite , but the computation is more involved .",
    "there are also new physical phenomenas : contrary to what one might naively expect , the intermediate states do not consist only of one particle which propagates out of the fermi sea .",
    "there is an additional contribution where one particle propagates in one direction , @xmath1 particles in the opposite direction and @xmath2 holes .",
    "the model is defined on a circle of length @xmath5 and the hamiltonian given by  : @xmath6 where we use units in which @xmath7 .",
    "its eigenfunctions are known and written  : @xmath8 with  : @xmath9 and @xmath10 is a symmetric function of the variables @xmath11 .",
    "the functions @xmath10 are symmetric polynomials in the variables @xmath12 and they are labeled by a partition @xmath13 .",
    "they are known as the jack polynomials @xmath14 .",
    "the properties of these polynomials were recently studied in the mathematical literature @xcite .",
    "the emergence of fractional statistics is seen by considering the spectrum of @xmath15 .",
    "this spectrum is like a free spectrum and is described by a set of quasi - momenta @xmath16 .",
    "the momentum and energy are given by additive laws  : @xmath17 and interaction between the particles is encoded in the fact that the quasi - momenta @xmath16 obey a generalized exclusion principle  : @xmath18 where @xmath19 are positive integers or zero .",
    "the ground state is described by the configuration of @xmath16 s the most densely packed around the origin , @xmath20 .",
    "for @xmath21 odd , the ground state momenta are  : @xmath22 by analogy with the fermion case ( @xmath23 ) we call this configuration the fermi sea . to describe the elementary excitations it is convenient to multiply the quasi - momenta @xmath16 by @xmath1 so that they differ by integer numbers .",
    "then , the fermi sea can be described by a set of occupied quasi - momenta separated by @xmath24 unoccupied ones . in this occupation number representation",
    ", a particle corresponds to one @xmath25 followed by @xmath24 zeroes and a hole corresponds to a sequence of @xmath1 zeroes .",
    "note that the effect of removing @xmath1 particles from the fermi sea is to create @xmath2 holes ( see figure 1 ) .    0.5 cm    12.0 truecm    0.5 cm    *",

    "0.4 cm    this description does not tell which type of excitations are produced when one acts with a specific operator .",
    "this information can only be obtained by considering the properties of the wave functions . in the next part",
    ", we use these properties to obtain the green function form factor .",
    "the quantity of interest here is the green function with the creation operator acting before the annihilation operator .",
    "the results in this section follow the paper @xcite where the notations are defined .",
    "it is written  : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a complete basis of states with @xmath31 particles and @xmath32 has n particles .",
    "this complete set of states can be expressed in terms of jack polynomials in @xmath31 variables  : @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xmath36 is an arbitrary integer and the partition @xmath13 is such that @xmath37 in order to avoid double counting of states .",
    "the quasi - momenta @xmath16 entering the expression of the energy and momentum ( 4 ) of the state @xmath38 are given in terms of @xmath13 by  : @xmath39    the vacuum state @xmath40 has been chosen in such a way that the quasimomentum of the @xmath31 particle is at the left of the fermi sea of the @xmath21 particle vacuum .",
    "another possible choice would have been to put this particle to the right by replacing the exponent of @xmath41 by @xmath42 in the expression ( 8) of @xmath40 .",
    "if @xmath0 is an integer , these two states belong to the same hilbert space and the two definitions give the same form factor in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "if @xmath0 is not integer , we shall see that the two possible choices give different form factors in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "the action of @xmath43 is to remove a particle at the positions @xmath44 , therefore setting the variable @xmath41 to 1 .",
    "the matrix element we need to compute is  : @xmath45 for all @xmath13 .",
    "it is possible to expand the jack polynomial in @xmath31 variables on polynomials in @xmath21 variables  : @xmath46 and here @xmath47 is different from zero only when @xmath13 covers @xmath48 and when the difference between @xmath13 and @xmath48 is at most a box per column . when these conditions are satisfied , the coefficient is given by@xcite  : @xmath49 the notations here are as follow : @xmath50 is a box on a young tableau identified by its coordinates @xmath51 . given a box , @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the number of boxes on its right and @xmath54 the number of boxes under it .",
    "the notation @xmath55 indicates that the quantities are evaluated with respect to the partition @xmath13 and @xmath56 denotes the set of columns of @xmath13 which have the same length as the corresponding column of @xmath48 .    the product in ( 11 )",
    "can also be expanded on jack polynomials with the relation @xcite  : @xmath57 with coefficient @xmath58  : @xmath59 with notations defined above .",
    "the results of @xcite are proven for @xmath0 integer but it is simple to extend the proof to arbitrary rational @xmath0 using kaneko s generalized selberg integrals @xcite .",
    "this coefficient is zero whenever the partition @xmath60 has more than @xmath2 legs or more than @xmath61 arms for @xmath62 .",
    "this is at the origin of the selection rule for the intermediate states . using these expansions and the orthogonality relation for the jack polynomials @xcite  : @xmath63 we find the matrix element @xmath64  : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the partition @xmath48 with @xmath36 columns added ( or subtracted when @xmath36 negative ) . in this expression @xmath66",
    "is a partition with at most @xmath2 legs , therefore @xmath67 .",
    "the correlation function is now written  : @xmath68 the evaluation of @xmath64 in the thermodynamical limit is our main result .",
    "all the quantities entering ( 17 ) are known from the mathematical literature and can be also found in @xcite .",
    "there is a first contribution coming from @xmath69 and @xmath70 which will be denoted @xmath71 .",
    "it this part , the only partitions contributing correspond to young tableaux , @xmath13 , having one  arm \" or one part , @xmath72 , with @xmath73 an arbitrary positive integer or young tableaux having @xmath21 parts of length @xmath74 denoted @xmath75 .",
    "each type of tableaux account for a particle propagating on a different side of the fermi sea . in the thermodynamical limit ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath76 where we used the variable  : @xmath77 and @xmath78 with @xmath79 .",
    "this is interpreted as the propagation of one particle over the fermi sea . for @xmath23 , the fermions , we find the correct result .",
    "the contributions for @xmath80 are present for finite @xmath21 but in the thermodynamic limit they are suppressed by factors of @xmath21 .",
    "the only remaining contribution is for @xmath81 .",
    "it comes from partitions @xmath13 which are of the form  : @xmath82    8.0 truecm    0.4 cm    * fig.2 : * young tableaux contributing to the correlation for @xmath26",
    ".    0.4 cm    here the @xmath83 s @xmath84 and @xmath85 are non negative integers and correspond to @xmath1 particles propagating in the forward direction and one particle in the backward direction outside the fermi sea .",
    "the @xmath86 @xmath87 are bounded by @xmath21 and are related to the momenta of the holes inside the fermi sea .",
    "when we take the continuum limit with the following variables  : @xmath88 we obtain the second part of the correlation function .",
    "the expression is given by  : @xmath89    the energy and momentum are  : @xmath90 and the constant  : @xmath91    the form factor @xmath92 is equal to  ;    @xmath93    @xmath94\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the appendix we give the main lines of the derivation of @xmath95 and we argue that this expression can be simplified to a single contour integral  : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a contour surrounding the points @xmath98 as in the figure 3 .    0.5 cm    12.0 truecm    0.5 cm    * fig.3 : * contour of integration .",
    "the branch cuts of the integrand are represented by dashed lines .    0.4 cm    when @xmath99 , this expression of @xmath95 coincides with the result obtained by zirnbauer and haldane @xcite",
    ". for @xmath0 integer ( or , equivalently , @xmath100 ) this result is rigorous and proves the conjecture in @xcite .",
    "the free fermion case @xmath23 is special in the sense that the second contribution to the form factor vanishes .",
    "we tested numerically the equality of the integrals ( 28 ) and ( 29 ) for @xmath99 and @xmath101 .",
    "this completes the computation of the form factor of the advanced green function for all rational values of the coupling constant @xmath0 .",
    "we computed the advanced green function in the calogero - sutherland model using jack polynomial techniques .",
    "the computation done here follows from the techniques already used in @xcite .",
    "the final expression for the form factor we obtain is the same for @xmath0 integer or not .",
    "there is however a big difference between the two cases .",
    "if @xmath0 is an integer , the form factor is invarient under a parity transformation ( change of sign of all the quasimomenta which define the intermediate state @xmath102 ) .",
    "if @xmath0 is not an integer , one particle propagates in the forward direction and q particle propagate in the backward direction but there is no contribution coming from a particle propagating in the backward direction and q particles in the forward direction .",
    "the form factor is thus not invariant under a parity transformation .",
    "the origin of this phenomena can be traced back to two possible inequivalent @xmath31 particles vacua .",
    "had we chosen the other possibility , we would have obtained the form factor conjugated under parity .",
    "the physical meaning of this phenomena is not clear to us .",
    "the results presented here simplify drastically in the continuum limit . finding a way to do these computations directly in this limit would be of great interest .",
    "the complexity of the part described by @xmath95 in our results show that simple bosonic vertex operators do nt seem to reproduce the right answer .",
    "note however that the integrals over the variables @xmath103 in the first expression of @xmath95 bear striking similarities with the screening operators which occur in the coulomb gaz representation of conformal field theories @xcite",
    "we wish to thank m.r .",
    "zirnbauer for discussions about the form factors and m. bauer and s. nonnenmacher for helping us with the complex analysis .",
    "f. lesage is supported by a canadian nserc 67 scholarship and a canadian postdoctoral fellowship .",
    "let us go back to the expression for the form factor  : @xmath65 and let us look at this expression for a fixed partition @xmath13 and a negative integer @xmath36 . then the coefficient @xmath104 forces the partition @xmath66 to have @xmath2 legs and @xmath61 arms . since @xmath36 is negative , the partition @xmath48 must have @xmath85 columns and then @xmath2 legs and @xmath61 arms .",
    "the main difficulty of the computation is to make the summation in ( a1 ) on the partitions @xmath48 such that @xmath105 . as explained in @xcite , only cases for which @xmath106 are allowed .",
    "the case considered in figure 2 corresponds to @xmath26 .",
    "again , we characterize the partition @xmath13 by the numbers @xmath107 which define the quasi - particle momenta in the continuum limit . in this case",
    "the partition @xmath13 is of the form  : @xmath108 and @xmath48 can be read similarly from the figure  : @xmath109          0.4 cm when we keep @xmath110 fixed , we must sum over the possibilities @xmath111 corresponding to the black boxes in the figure . the restriction that @xmath112 is a one dimensional strip gives the following constraints on the @xmath110 s  : @xmath113    if we use the variables appropriate for the continuum limit @xmath114 and we will use @xmath115 .",
    "the sum over the @xmath110 s in the intervals defined by ( a2 ) become integrals over the continuum variables @xmath116s . this correspond to the shaded parts in the figure .",
    "let us concentrate on the sum over @xmath117 , factorizing out the part which is independent of @xmath117 .",
    "this sum results in the following expression  : @xmath118.\\ ] ] here @xmath119 is the ensemble for which @xmath120 and we have to sum over all possibilities @xmath121 .",
    "the symbol @xmath122 means the cardinal of the ensemble . before taking the thermodynamical limit of this expression , we note the following property  : @xmath123 = \\frac{\\partial_{v_1} ...",
    "\\partial_{v_p}\\prod_{i < j}(v_i - v_j ) \\prod_{i=1}^pf(v_i ) } { \\prod_{i < j}(v_i - v_j)\\prod_{i=1}^pf(v_i ) } \\ ] ] this expression , which comes from the definition of the derivative , can be also written as  : @xmath124 and it is unchanged if a quantity of order one in @xmath125 is added .",
    "let @xmath126 have the form @xmath127 . to first order in @xmath125",
    ": @xmath128 replacing this in ( a5 ) and putting @xmath129 gives the large @xmath21 limit of the sum in ( a3 ) , with @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 , @xmath133 .",
    "it remains to do the integrals over the variables @xmath116 s .",
    "when we multiply ( a7 ) by the part depending explicitly on @xmath110 and factor out the part which is independent of @xmath110 we obtain the following multiple integral  : @xmath135\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] doing explicitly these integrals is not an easy task .",
    "however , a careful analysis of this expression suggests it can take the simpler form of a single contour integral . in the following",
    "we present the arguments leading to this conjecture .",
    "the integral @xmath119 can be regarded as a complex function of the variables @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "we try to obtain the limit of @xmath119 when the points @xmath98 collapse onto the point @xmath138 and @xmath139 . due to the antisymmetry of the integrand as a function of @xmath140 , changing counterclockwise @xmath141 and @xmath142",
    ", @xmath143 just multiplies the integral by a phase @xmath144 .",
    "we expect then branch points at @xmath145 .",
    "the singular part of the integral responsible of these branch points can be calculated :        further simplification arises when we specialize the variables @xmath150 .",
    "this operation is delicate when done on an expression like ( a7 ) , so it is easier to restart from the discrete version ( a4 ) and put @xmath151 .",
    "the sum reduces over the ensembles @xmath152  : @xmath153 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{g(v ) } \\sum_{s=0}^p ( -1)^s { p \\choose s } g(v+as)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath154 here the notation @xmath155 is used . in the last term of the equality ( a10 ) one recognizes the discrete @xmath156 derivative of @xmath157 . using stirling s formula and the homogeneity of @xmath158 we get in the large @xmath21 limit  : @xmath159 .\\ ] ] note that the powers @xmath160 and @xmath25 have opposite sign in ( a7 ) and ( a11 ) .",
