    "in a series of papers published last year @xcite we introduced the concept of strongly correlating liquids and demonstrated by computer simulations that this includes a large class of model liquids . specifically , the fluctuations which are in many cases strongly correlated are those of the configurational parts of pressure and energy , i.e. , the parts in addition to the ideal gas terms , coming from the interatomic forces .",
    "recall that for any microscopic state , energy @xmath0 and pressure @xmath1 have contributions both from particle momenta and positions :    @xmath2    here @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the kinetic and potential energies , respectively , and @xmath5 is the `` kinetic temperature '' , proportional to the kinetic energy per particle.@xcite the configurational contribution to pressure is the virial @xmath6 , which is defined@xcite by    @xmath7    for a liquid with pair interactions , if @xmath8 is the pair potential and @xmath9 is the distance between particles @xmath10 and @xmath11 , we have    @xmath12    strong @xmath13 correlation , if present at all , is observed under conditions of fixed volume , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ wu_nvt_nvp](a ) .",
    "the degree of correlation is quantified by the standard correlation coefficient @xmath14 , defined@xcite by    @xmath15    here and henceforth , unless otherwise specified , angle brackets @xmath16 denote thermal nvt ensemble averages ; @xmath17 denotes deviation from the average value of the quantity in question .",
    "we call liquids with @xmath18 strongly correlating .",
    "another characteristic quantity is the `` slope '' @xmath19 , which we define@xcite as the ratio of standard deviations :    @xmath20    in the limit of perfect correlation ( @xmath21 ) @xmath19 becomes equal to the standard linear - regression slope for @xmath6 as a function of @xmath4 at fixed volume .    in paper i@xcite of this series",
    "it was shown that strongly correlating liquids are typically those with van der waals type attraction and steep repulsion , which in simulations are often modelled by combinations of one or more lennard - jones type potentials .",
    "typical slope values for the latter are of order 6 , depending slightly on state point ( in the limit of very high density or temperature the slope converges slowly to 4 ) . experimental data for argon were analyzed and shown to be consistent with strong correlations ( @xmath22 ) in the region of the phase diagram where quantum effects are not important .",
    "it is worth noting that the class of strongly correlating liquids does not simply correspond to radially symmetric pair potentials .",
    "firstly , two metallic systems with many - body potentials were found to be strongly correlating ; it is probably true for metallic systems in general , although this needs to be confirmed .",
    "also many molecular liquids are strongly correlating .",
    "in fact , any potential with an inverse power - law dependence on distances ( not necessarily based on pair interactions ) is perfectly correlating .",
    "secondly , there exist radially symmetric pair potentials which are not strongly correlating , for example the dzugutov system.@xcite one reason for strong correlation not to hold in some molecular systems is the presence of coulombic terms in the potential . by themselves",
    "these would give strong correlation , but their combination with lennard - jones forces typically leads to weak correlation .",
    "this was detailed in paper i , which presented results from simulations of 13 different model liquids . in our present understanding based on these simulations , liquids with two length scales in their potentials",
    "are rarely strongly correlating .",
    "paper ii@xcite in this series analyzed the case of the standard single - component lennard - jones liquid in detail .",
    "building on the fact that inverse power - law potentials @xmath23 are perfectly correlating , the results of this analysis can be summarized as follows : ( 1 ) almost all of the fluctuations in @xmath6 and @xmath4 come from interparticle separations in the region of the first peak of the radial distribution function @xmath24 ; ( 2 ) in this region the lennard - jones potential is approximated very well by the sum of an inverse power law with exponent @xmath2518 and a linear term @xmath26 ; ( 3 ) when volume is fixed , the parts of @xmath6 and @xmath4 that come from the linear term are almost constant .",
    "our initial and simpler explanation of strong @xmath27 correlations ( ref .  ) was based on the dominance of close encounters , i.e. , that it is only the nature of the repulsive part of the potential that matters for the strong correlations .",
    "this explanation , however , is adequate at high pressure / density only",
    ". it does not explain the requirement of fixed volume , nor the fact that strong correlation is observed even at zero pressure , as well as for the low - temperature / low - pressure ( classical ) crystal . to see that an explanation at the individual pair interaction level is generally inadequate ,",

    "these are sums over the pair interactions a given particle has with its neighbors ; summing over all particles gives the total potential energy and virial , respectively .",
    "if strong correlation held at the level of single pair interactions , it would also hold at the particle level , but it clearly does not .",

    "section  [ ipl - etc ] begins with a discussion of the scaling properties of systems with inverse power - law ( ipl ) potentials , the natural starting point for a discussion of the hidden scaling properties of strongly correlating liquids .",

    "we illustrate with simulation results the key property that the linear term contributes significantly to the virial and potential energy fluctuations when the volume may fluctuate , but little when it is fixed .",
    "hence it gives rise , approximately , to a volume - dependent term in the free energy of the type discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "this leads to an inherited approximate scaling property , which we refer to as `` hidden scale invariance '' since it is not immediately obvious from the intermolecular potential .",

    ". the last main section , sec .",
    "[ thermo ] , comprises two topics under the heading `` thermodynamics of strongly correlating liquids '' .",
    "first we discuss the relation of pressure - energy correlation to the thermodynamic grneisen parameter @xmath31 , showing that the slope @xmath19 ( eq .  ( [ slopedefinition ] ) ) is larger than @xmath31 by roughly a factor involving the ratio of excess ( configurational ) to total specific heats ( constant volume ) .",
    "this ratio is around two for many simple liquids .",
    "@xcite the second part formulates the property of strong correlation in the energy - bond language known as `` network thermodynamics''.@xcite",
    "the purpose of this section is to summarize the properties of inverse - power law potentials and identify which of these properties are inherited by strongly correlating liquids and which are not .",
    "inverse power - law ( ipl ) potentials  sometimes referred to as soft - sphere potentials  have been used in liquid state theory for many years as convenient model systems.@xcite such potentials have a number of simple properties .",
    "ipl potentials have , however , been considered unrealistic because their predicted equation of state is quite wrong and because they have no stable low - pressure liquid phase and no van der waals loop , problems which derive from the fact that ipl potentials are purely repulsive . moreover ,",
    "the correct ipl exponent fitting the lennard - jones ( lj ) liquid is around @xmath32 ( papers i and ii , refs . ) , not @xmath33 as one might naively guess from the repulsive @xmath34 term of the lj potential ; this may have confused people searching from an effective ipl description of the lj liquid . a major point made in this series of papers",
    "is that when interpreted correctly , ipl potentials are much more realistic than generally thought , because they describe well a number of properties of strongly correlating liquids . for reference we now briefly summarize the since long well - established properties of ipl liquids .",
    "consider @xmath35 identical particles in volume @xmath36 interacting by a pair potential of the form @xmath37 ; we make the pair assumption for simplicity but note that the below argument generalizes immediately to any potential that is an euler homogeneous function of the position coordinates . from the standard partition function",
    "the ( helmholtz ) free energy @xmath38 is conveniently written@xcite as the ideal gas term plus the nontrivial `` excess '' free energy , @xmath39 .",
    "the first term is the free energy of an ideal gas at same volume and temperature , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the particle number density and @xmath42 is the thermal de broglie wavelength .",
    "the excess free energy is given@xcite by    @xmath43    whenever @xmath44 this expression leads to a free energy with a well - defined extensive thermodynamic limit ( @xmath45).@xcite    it follows from eq .",
    "( [ fex ] ) that the excess free energy of an ipl liquid is given as follows in terms of a function of density @xmath46 to the power @xmath47 over temperature @xmath48 , @xmath49 ( klein s theorem@xcite ) :",
    "@xmath50    this implies that a number of derived quantities are also functions of @xmath51 . as important examples ,",
    "recall the following standard identities : the excess entropy : @xmath52 , the potential energy : @xmath53 , the virial @xmath54 , the excess isothermal bulk modulus : @xmath55 , the excess isochoric specific heat per unit volume : @xmath56 , the excess pressure coefficient : @xmath57 . from eq .",
    "( [ fex_ipl ] ) it follows that these three quantities are functions of the single variable @xmath51 ; more accurately one has [ where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60x\\phi'(x)$ ] , and @xmath61    @xmath62    the functions @xmath63 all depend on @xmath64 , but for simplicity of notation we have not indicated this explicitly .",
    "dividing across by the dimensional factors on the right hand side ( for example @xmath65 in the case of potential energy and virial ) , one arrives at dimensionless forms of the excess entropy , potential energy , etc .",
    "that are functions of @xmath51 only .",
    "turning now to the dynamics , consider the standard molecular dynamics ( md ) case where the equations of motion are newton s equations .",
    "( @xmath67 ) is a solution to newton s equations .",
    "then it is straightforward to show that @xmath68 is also a solution if @xmath69 . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath66 refers to equilibrium ( nve or nvt ) dynamics at a state point with density @xmath70 and temperature @xmath71 , then @xmath68 refers to equilibrium dynamics at density @xmath72 at temperature @xmath73 ( temperature scales as the mean - square velocity and velocities get a factor @xmath74 ) . using the above relation between @xmath75 and @xmath76 this implies    @xmath77",
    "this means that two states with different densities and temperatures but same @xmath51 have dynamics that scale into one another by simple scalings of space and time . in particular ,",
    "if for any quantity @xmath78 one defines the relaxation time @xmath79 via @xmath80 , it follows that any two states with same @xmath51 have same `` reduced '' ( dimensionless ) relaxation time @xmath81 , if this quantity is defined by @xmath82 where the characteristic thermal time @xmath83 is defined by @xmath84 .",
    "similarly , if one defines the reduced diffusion constant @xmath85 by @xmath86 where @xmath87 , then @xmath85 is the same for the two states .",
    "summarizing ,    @xmath88    finally we note that it follows from the above scaling property that    @xmath89    thus the boltzmann factors of the two configurations are the same and , consequently , the scaling of the dynamics holds also for stochastic dynamics ; this observation , in a generalized form , is the starting point of paper iv in this series . by the same argument the structure of states with same @xmath51 are identical ,",
    "provided lengths are scaled by @xmath90 .",
    "this section discusses how a large class of potentials inherits a number of ipl properties to a good approximation , thus justifying the term `` hidden scale invariance '' .",
    "consider a general potential between particles @xmath10 and @xmath11 , rewriting it ( as can always be done ) as a sum of an ipl potential plus the difference , denoted `` diff '' :    @xmath91    for any configuration , @xmath92 , the potential energy is then the sum of an `` ipl '' term and a `` diff '' term , and the excess free energy is given by    @xmath93    we now investigate consequences of the assumption ( sec .",
    "iii ) that @xmath94 to a good approximation is only a function of volume : @xmath95  at least for states that carry boltzmann weights of any significance .",
    "the approximate identity @xmath96 means that the second exponential can be moved outside the integral , and we get :    @xmath97    from this follows directly that    @xmath98    which implies    @xmath99    while the systems under consideration here have the same excess entropy as the `` hidden '' ipl , several quantities have contributions from the @xmath100-term .",
    "these quantities do not obey ipl scaling .",
    "in contrast , the scaling behavior for dynamics and structure _ is _ inherited : consider two state points with the same @xmath51 .",
    "for the pure ipl system ( @xmath101 ) the two state points have the same dynamics and structure as argued in the previous section .",
    "letting @xmath102 simply shifts the energy surface , which changes neither the dynamics nor the structure.@xcite this scenario  scaling of the dynamics , but not the equation of state  is exactly what is observed experimentally for a large number of viscous liquids .",
    "for example in van der waals liquids relaxation times are found to be a function of @xmath51 ( using @xmath64 as an empirical parameter),@xcite but the scaling does not apply to the ( excess ) pressure with the exponent determined from the scaling of relaxation time , as required for ipl scaling.@xcite    in the following section we provide numerical evidence that there are indeed systems that to a good approximation fulfil the assumption introduced above that @xmath94 is a function of volume only .",
    "in this section we examine the extent to which the lennard - jones ( lj ) potential may be approximated by an `` extended inverse power - law '' potential ( including a linear term , eq .",
    "( [ v_eipl ] ) below ) , by considering the fluctuations at a particular state point of the lj fluid .",
    "we choose a state point whose pressure is near zero , because here it is particularly clear that single - pair effects are insufficient to explain the strong @xmath27 correlation ( fig .",
    "1 ) .    the analysis of paper ii took its starting point in assuming that the approximating inverse power law should match the potential closely at a particular value of interparticle separation .",
    "an important conclusion of the analysis was , however , that the success of the ipl approximation derives not from its behavior near any particular @xmath103-value , but rather from the fact the difference from the real potential is close to linear over the whole first - peak region . in this section",
    "we re - examine the idea that the fluctuations are well described by an inverse power - law potential and the argument for why the difference term almost does not fluctuate .",
    "we show explicitly that the latter contributes little to the fluctuations at constant volume , but significantly when the volume is allowed to fluctuate as in the npt ensemble .",
    "this demonstrates that the lj potential is of the type considered in the previous subsection .",
    "we wish to determine to what extent the lj potential    @xmath104    can be matched , for the purpose of describing fluctuations of potential energy and virial at fixed volume , by an inverse power law    @xmath105\\,.\\ ] ]    here @xmath106 indicates an optional constant . to start with , how should the exponent @xmath64 and the coefficients @xmath78 and @xmath106 be chosen ?",
    "an obvious choice , followed in the first part of paper ii , is to require that the two potentials , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , should agree as much as possible around a particular value of @xmath103 , denoted @xmath109 .",
    "given @xmath109 , if we require the functions and their first two derivatives to match at @xmath109 , this determines all three parameters @xmath78 , @xmath64 and @xmath106 .",
    "the exponent @xmath64 is given ( paper ii ) by    @xmath110    here the notation @xmath111 refers to one kind of @xmath103-dependent effective inverse power - law exponent , based on the ratio of the second and first derivatives . for @xmath112",
    "this simply returns @xmath64 .",
    "otherwise it gives a local matching of the @xmath112 to @xmath113 .",
    "this leaves effectively one parameter to vary , namely @xmath109 , which must be less than the minimum @xmath114 where @xmath115 diverges .",
    "the parameter @xmath109 may be chosen to optimize the match of the fluctuations in total energy and virial .",
    "for an nvt simulation at @xmath28k and near - zero pressure , the best fit was obtained with @xmath116 ( while the exponent implied by the slope [ eq . ( [ slopedefinition ] ) ] , @xmath117 , was slightly smaller , 18.9 ) .    later in paper",
    "ii it was demonstrated that there is no particular reason why the potentials should match close at a particular value of @xmath103 , since the fluctuations have contributions from the whole first - peak region , including beyond the potential minimum .",
    "the reason that any kind of matching is possible over this region  where @xmath107 clearly does not resemble a power law  is that a linear term may be added to the power - law potential almost without affecting the fluctuations _ as long as the volume is held constant_. the analysis of paper ii , which also included an in - depth treatment of the perfect lj ( fcc ) crystal which is also strongly correlating , showed that the more relevant @xmath103-dependent effective exponent is the higher order @xmath118 defined by    @xmath119    this also returns @xmath64 for @xmath112 , but since it does not involve the first derivative , it returns @xmath64 even if a linear function of @xmath103 is added to the potential as in the extended inverse power - law potential ( eipl ) defined by    @xmath120    this potential fits the lj potential very well around its minimum ( paper ii ) and thus includes part of its attractive part .",
    "there are several possible ways of choosing the `` best '' eipl to match the real potential",
    ". these will give slightly different exponents and coefficients @xmath78 , @xmath106 and @xmath121 .",
    "we do not investigate them here ; rather the purpose is to validate the basic idea of the extended inverse power - law ( eipl ) approximation .",
    "therefore we choose a simple matching scheme , whereby we match the fluctuations to those of the inverse power - law potential , without including a linear term , in order to determine @xmath64 and @xmath78 . for simplicity",
    "we take the exponent directly from the observed fluctuations : @xmath122 where @xmath19 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ slopedefinition ] ) . to fix the coefficient @xmath78 , agreement with the potential energy and virial fluctuations",

    "the difference quantities @xmath127 and @xmath128 are defined as    @xmath129    a perfect match of the fluctuations would mean that @xmath127 and @xmath128 have zero variance .",
