    "are shown by solid curves as functions of deformation @xmath0 . ]    a substantial enhancement of the shell effect is expected in accordance with the so - called bridge orbit bifurcations .",
    "typically , bridge orbits emerge between two quite different periodic orbits when their periods cross in the deformation - action ( @xmath87 ) plane @xcite .",
    "for instance , consider the two - dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator ( ho ) perturbed by a nonlinear term . in pure ( unperturbed ) ho system , there are two isolated diametric orbits along principal axes .",
    "when the two oscillator frequencies encounter in a rational ratio , all the classical orbits of lissajous figures become periodic with same periods and stabilities , namely , they form a doubly degenerate family .",

    "if a perturbation is imposed and the above dynamical symmetry is slightly broken , the degenerate family will be replaced by the bridge orbit(s ) , which emerge from one diameter at smaller deformation and then submerge into the other diameter at larger deformation . since the loci or two diameters in phase space are quite distant from each other , bridge orbits will travel a long way in the phase space from one to the other during the bifurcation scenario .",

    "the stationary points indicated by solid and open circles correspond to periodic orbits . with increasing @xmath0 , bridge orbit",
    "bifurcation occurs as follows :    1 .",
    "there are two periodic orbits p ( stable ) and q ( unstable ) .",
    "2 .   the stable orbit p bifurcates and a new orbit b emerges .",
    "p turns unstable ( p ) afterwards .",
    "a local family of quasiperiodic orbits ( indicated by the shaded range ) are formed around orbits p and b. 3 .",

    "the quasiperiodic orbit family extends from p to q. 4 .",
    "orbit b approaches the orbit q. 5 .",
    "orbit b submerges into the orbit q , and q becomes stable ( q ) afterwards .",
    "thus , due to the coherent contribution of the quasiperiodic orbit family , the bridge orbit is expected to make a significant contribution to the level density and leads to an enhancement of the shell effect .",
    "since the family formed around the bridge orbit is extended between two orbits p and q which are distant from each other in the phase space , this bifurcation is related with the restoration of a somewhat global dynamical symmetry in comparison to the simple bifurcations .",
    "note that the bridge orbit does not appear for every crossing of two orbits in @xmath90 plane .",
    "the appearance of bridge orbits might be an indication of the existence of global approximate dynamical symmetry .",
    "using the scaling invariance of our radial power - law potential model , the semiclassical analysis becomes quite simple .",
    "since the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) has the scaling property @xmath91 the equations of motion are invariant under the scale transformation @xmath92 therefore , classical dynamics does not depend on energy @xmath30 , and classical trajectories at any energy @xmath30 can be obtained from those at the certain reference energy @xmath93 by the scale transformation @xmath94 thus we have the same set of periodic orbits regardless of energy .",

    "we have shown that this anomalously strong enhancement of shell effects in the nonintegral system has a close relation to the bridge bifurcations of periodic orbits having almost the same periods , which are similar to the situation in rational ho system .",
    "its relation to the fact that the tetrahedral magic numbers are exactly the same as those for spherical ho might also be an interesting problem .    in evaluating the semiclassical level density , the gutzwiller formula overestimates the amplitude factor and we could not reproduce the shell structures in the bifurcation region , which we are most interested in .",
    "one of the ways to overcome this problem will be the use of uniform approximations @xcite .",
    "one may suspect that the bifurcations in three - dimensional systems might be quite complicated in comparison to the two - dimensional case where all the basic bifurcation scenarios are classified by catastrophe theory @xcite .",
    "fortunately , we can expect that most of the bifurcations might be analyzed in the same way as in two - dimensional systems .",
    "since the monodromy matrix has a unit eigenvalue at the bifurcation point , four eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix of bifurcating orbits must be decomposed into two conjugate / reciprocal pairs .",

    "a practical procedure might be complicated , but it is of great interest to us to estimate semiclassical level densities and shell correction energies in the bifurcation regions and reproduce the anomalous shell effect obtained for the tetrahedral state .    for more quantitative discussions on nuclear systems , one should take account of the spin - orbit coupling .",

    "a part of the numerical calculations were carried out at the yukawa institute computer facility .",
    "let us consider the tetrahedron whose four vertices are located at @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "the equations of four faces are @xmath154 on the surface of the tetrahedron , one of the above four equations is satisfied , namely , @xmath155 it is transformed into spherical coordinates @xmath156 as @xmath157 with @xmath158 where @xmath159 and @xmath160 are the legendre polynomial and associated legendre function , respectively .",
    "the functions @xmath18 and @xmath19 are both symmetric under the transformations of the tetrahedral group .",
    "the equation of tetrahedral surface can be obtained as the least positive root of the above fourth - order equation of @xmath161 .",
    "writing @xmath162 , this equation becomes @xmath163 if one introduces a parameter @xmath15 and modifies the above equation as @xmath164 @xmath21 gives the sphere @xmath165 , and @xmath23 gives the equation identical to eq .",
    "( [ eq : shape_tetra2 ] ) , namely , the tetrahedron . thus , by varying the parameter @xmath15 from 0 to 1 , one can smoothly interpolate the sphere and tetrahedron keeping the tetrahedral symmetry .",
    "the tetrahedral group @xmath20 contains 24 symmetry transformations which are classified into five classes : identity @xmath166 , eight rotations @xmath119 , six rotatory reflections @xmath118 , three rotations @xmath167 and six reflections @xmath120 .",
    "here we follow the notations in ref .",
    "this group has five irreducible representations ( irreps ) : two one - dimensional irreps @xmath168 , @xmath169 , one two - dimensional irrep @xmath39 , and two three - dimensional irreps @xmath170 , @xmath171 . the quantum spectra can be obtained by a diagonalization of the hamiltonian within the bases of each irrep .",
    "after the complete decomposition of the bases , the dimension of the hamiltonian matrix for irreps @xmath172 , @xmath39 , and @xmath173 are about 1/24 , 1/12 , and 1/8 , respectively , of the total number of bases . thus one can highly reduce the numerical loads by the basis decomposition .    for the construction of the basis , the irreps of the rotational group are employed .",
    "the basis function of the rotational group is given by spherical harmonics @xmath174 .",
    "they form reducible representations of the group @xmath20 , and the decomposition to each irrep can be carried out by the projection method @xcite .",
    "the projection operator onto the irrep @xmath41 is given by @xmath175 where the sum is taken over all the symmetry transformations @xmath176 of the group @xmath20 , @xmath177 is the order of the group @xmath20 , @xmath178 is the dimension of the irrep @xmath41 , and @xmath179 is the character of @xmath176 in the irrep @xmath41 . by applying the @xmath180 on @xmath174 ,",
    "a linear combination of the bases of irrep @xmath41 included in @xmath174 is extracted .",
    "@xmath181 can be calculated by the euler angle representation of the transformation @xmath176 as @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the rotation with euler angles @xmath184 , and @xmath185 is the wigner s @xmath186 function .",
    "the complete set of the bases in irrep @xmath41 are obtained by extracting all the linearly independent functions out of @xmath187 functions @xmath188 @xmath189 by the gramm - schmidt orthogonalization process .",
    "the spectrum in irrep @xmath39 is doubly degenerated and the bases can be further decomposed into two parts by the parity with respect to a reflection @xmath120 . the spectrum in irreps @xmath173 are triply degenerated and the bases are also decomposed by @xmath120 into two parts : one is doubly degenerated and the other is of no degeneracies . in obtaining spectra , one has only to consider the non - degenerated part , which corresponds to @xmath190 for the irrep @xmath170 and @xmath191 for the irrep @xmath171 .    in the current numerical calculations , we diagonalized the hamiltonian using the spherical harmonic oscillator bases with 41 major shells ( @xmath192 ) .",
    "the largest decomposed matrix ( for the irrep @xmath170 ) has the size 1650 among 12341 single - particle bases in total .",
    "the maslov index @xmath193 for a periodic orbit ( po ) is practically obtained as the sum of two contributions @xcite .",
    "one is from the number of conjugate points @xmath194 , singularities of the semiclassical propagator , and the other is the number of negative eigenvalues @xmath195 of the matrix @xmath196 which arises when one evaluate the trace integral by means of a stationary phase approximation . here , @xmath197 is the action integral along the po @xmath198 and @xmath199 is an arbitrary point on the orbit .",
    "each of those two contributions ( @xmath194 and @xmath195 ) depends on the choice of the initial point @xmath200 or the choice of coordinate set , but the sum @xmath201 does not depend on such conditions .",
    "the matrix ( [ eq : sqq ] ) is directly connected to the monodromy matrix @xcite and there are no difficulties in obtaining @xmath195 .",
    "let us consider the way of counting conjugate points with respect to initial point @xmath200 .",
    "conjugate points are classified into three kinds of singularities : turning points , focal points and caustics . at the turning point ,",
    "the velocity becomes zero and the orbit forms a cusp there . at the focal points , a group of orbits ejected from initial point @xmath200 with momentum directions slightly deviated from @xmath202 concentrates into the original orbit with respect to one direction . at caustics , the orbit contacts with the envelope formed by the above group of orbits .",
    "the focal points and caustics along the orbits correspond to the singularities of the determinant @xmath203 namely the zeros of the determinant @xmath204 the suffixes imply the local cartesian coordinates where the first axis is taken along the po and the second and third axes are perpendicular to it .",
    "let us consider two orbits in vicinity of the po , whose initial momentum @xmath202 is infinitesimally shifted towards the second and third axes , respectively , by @xmath205 then , the deviations of those orbits from po are @xmath206 and one has @xmath207 together with turning points @xmath208 , the total number of conjugate points is obtained by counting the zeros of the quantity @xmath209 along po @xmath210 .",
