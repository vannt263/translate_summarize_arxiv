    "the liquid - gas ( lg ) phase transition in nuclear matter remains illusive and a hot research topic despite of the great efforts devoted to understanding its nature and experimental manifestations by the nuclear physics community over many years@xcite .",
    "for a recent review , see , e.g. , refs.@xcite .",
    "most of the previous studies have focused on the lg phase transition in symmetric nuclear matter . while in an asymmetric nuclear matter",
    ", the lg phase transition is expected to display some distinctly new features because of the isospin degree of freedom and the associated interactions and additional conservation laws@xcite .",
    "this expectation together with the need to understand better properties of asymmetric nuclear matter relevant for both nuclear physics and astrophysics have stimulated a lot of new work recentlyliko97,ma99,wang00,su00,lee01,li01,natowitz02,li02,chomaz03,sil04,lizx04,chomaz06,li07 .",
    "moreover , the study on the lg phase transition in asymmetric nuclear matter has received recently a strong boost from the impressive progress in developing more advanced radioactive beams that can be used to create transiently in terrestrial laboratories large volumes of highly asymmetric nuclear matter . though significant progress has been made recently in studying properties of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter and the lg phase transition in it , there are still many challenging questions to be answered . among the main difficulties",
    "are our poor understanding about the isovector nuclear interaction and the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy @xcite .",
    "fortunately , recent analyses of the isospin diffusion data in heavy - ion reactions have allowed us to put a stringent constraint on the symmetry energy of neutron - rich matter at sub - normal densities betty04,chen05,lichen05 .",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate how the constrained symmetry energy may allow us to better understand the lg phase transition in asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "moreover , both the isovector ( i.e. , the nuclear symmetry potential ) and isoscalar parts of the single nucleon potential should be momentum dependent .",
    "however , effects of the momentum - dependent interactions on the lg phase transition in asymmetric nuclear matter were not thoroughly investigated previously .",
    "we report here our recent progress in investigating effects of the isospin and momentum dependent interactions on the lg phase transition in hot neutron - rich nuclear matter within a self - consistent thermal model using three different interactions@xcite .",
    "the first one is the isospin and momentum dependent mdi interaction constrained by the isospin diffusion data in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the second one is a momentum - independent interaction ( mid ) which leads to a fully momentum independent single nucleon potential , and the third one is an isoscalar momentum - dependent interaction ( emdyi ) in which the isoscalar part of the single nucleon potential is momentum dependent but the isovector part of the single nucleon potential is momentum independent .",
    "we note that the mdi interaction is realistic , while the other two are only used as references in order to explore effects of the isospin and momentum dependence of the nuclear interaction .",
    "in the isospin and momentum - dependent mdi interaction , the potential energy density @xmath0 of a thermally equilibrated asymmetric nuclear matter at total density @xmath1 , temperature @xmath2 and isospin asymmetry @xmath3 is expressed as follows  @xcite , @xmath4 in the mean field approximation , eq .",

    "@xmath7    in the above the isospin @xmath8 is @xmath9 for neutrons and @xmath10 for protons , and @xmath11 is the phase space distribution function at coordinate @xmath12 and momentum @xmath5 .",
    "the detailed values of the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite and have been assumed to be temperature independent here .",
    "the isospin and momentum - dependent mdi interaction gives the binding energy per nucleon of @xmath15 mev , incompressibility @xmath16 mev and the symmetry energy of @xmath17 mev for cold symmetric nuclear matter at saturation density @xmath18 @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the different @xmath20 values in the mdi interaction are introduced to vary the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy while keeping other properties of the nuclear equation of state fixed @xcite .",
    "we note that the mdi interaction has been extensively used in the transport model for studying isospin effects in intermediate - energy heavy - ion collisions induced by neutron - rich nuclei li04b , chen04,chen05,lichen05,li05pion , li06,yong061,yong062,yong07 .",
    "in particular , the isospin diffusion data from nscl / msu have constrained the value of @xmath20 to be between @xmath21 and @xmath22 for nuclear matter densities less than about @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "we will thus in the present work consider the two values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 with @xmath24 giving a softer symmetry energy while @xmath25 giving a stiffer symmetry energy .",
    "the potential part of the symmetry energy @xmath26 at zero temperature can be parameterized by @xcite @xmath27 ( % \\frac{\\rho } { \\rho _ { 0}})^{g(x ) } , \\label{epotsym}\\]]where the values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 for different @xmath20 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .      in the momentum - independent mid interaction ,",
    "the potential energy density @xmath30 of a thermally equilibrated asymmetric nuclear matter at total density @xmath1 and isospin asymmetry @xmath3 can be written as @xmath31the parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are determined by the incompressibility @xmath35 of cold symmetric nuclear matter at saturation density @xmath36 as in ref .",

    "we calculate the chemical potential isobars at @xmath70 mev , which is a typical temperature of lg phase transition .",
    "the solid curves shown in the left panel of fig .

    "the values of the critical pressure are @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 mev@xmath73@xmath80 for the mdi interaction with @xmath24 , mid interaction with @xmath24 , mdi interaction with @xmath25 and mid interaction with @xmath25 , respectively .    shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ mudelta ] is the chemical potential isobar as a function of the isospin asymmetry @xmath3 at @xmath70 mev by using the emdyi interaction with @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "compared with the results from the mdi and mid interactions , the main difference is that the left ( and right ) extrema of @xmath81 and @xmath82 do not correspond to the same @xmath3 but they do for the mdi and mid interactions as shown in the left panel .",
    "the chemical potential of neutrons increases more rapidly with pressure than that of protons in this temperature . at lower pressures , for example , @xmath72 mev/@xmath80 as shown in panel ( a )",
    ", the rectangle can be accurately constructed and thus the gibbs conditions ( [ coexistencemu ] ) and ( [ coexistencep ] ) have two solutions . due to the asynchronous variation of @xmath81 and @xmath82 with pressure , we will get a limiting pressure @xmath83 above which no rectangle can be constructed and the coexistence equations ( [ coexistencemu ] ) and ( [ coexistencep ] ) have no solution .",

    "the two different values of @xmath3 correspond to two different phases with different densities and the lower density phase ( with larger @xmath3 value ) defines a gas phase while the higher density phase ( with smaller @xmath71 value ) defines a liquid phase . collecting all such pairs of @xmath86 and @xmath87 thus forms the binodal surface .",

    "mignon  is the coexistence phase of liquid phase and gas phase .",
    "interestingly , we can see from fig .",
    "[ pdelta ] ( a ) that the stiffer symmetry energy ( @xmath25 ) significantly lowers the critical point ( cp ) and makes the maximal asymmetry ( ma ) a little smaller .",
    "meanwhile , the momentum dependence in the interaction ( mdi ) lifts the cp in a larger amount , while it seems to have no effects on the ma point .",
    "in addition , just as expected , the value of @xmath20 does not affect the equal concentration ( ec ) point while the momentum dependence lifts it slightly ( by about @xmath89 mev/@xmath80 ) .",
    "these features clearly indicate that the critical pressure and the area of phase - coexistence region in hot asymmetric nuclear matter is very sensitive to the stiffness of the symmetry energy with a softer symmetry energy giving a higher critical pressure and a larger area of phase - coexistence region .",
    "meanwhile , the critical pressure and the area of phase - coexistence region are also sensitive to the momentum dependence .",
    "the mdi interaction has a larger area of phase coexistence region and a larger value of the critical pressure , compared to the result of mid interaction in the temperature of @xmath70 mev .",
    "[ pdelta ] ( b ) displays the section of the binodal surface at @xmath70 mev by using the emdyi interaction with @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we can see that the curve is cut off at the limiting pressure with @xmath84 and @xmath90 mev/@xmath80 for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "we can also see that the limiting pressure and the area of phase - coexistence region are still sensitive to the stiffness of the symmetry energy with a softer symmetry energy ( @xmath24 ) giving a higher limit pressure and a larger area of phase - coexistence region in this temperature .    comparing the results of the mdi and mid interactions shown in fig .",
    "[ pdelta ] ( a ) , we can see that for pressures lower than the limiting pressure , the binodal surface from the emdyi interaction is similar to that from the mdi interaction .",
    "this feature implies that the momentum dependence of the symmetry potential has little influence on the lg phase transition in hot asymmetric nuclear matter while the momentum dependence of the isoscalar single nucleon potential significantly changes the area of phase - coexistence region for pressures lower than the limiting pressure . for pressures above the limiting pressure",
    ", the momentum dependence of both the isoscalar and isovector single nucleon potentials becomes important .",
    "in summary , we have studied the liquid - gas phase transition in hot neutron - rich nuclear matter within a self - consistent thermal model using three different nuclear effective interactions , namely , the isospin and momentum dependent mdi interaction constrained by the isospin diffusion data in heavy - ion collisions , the momentum - independent mid interaction , and the isoscalar momentum - dependent emdyi interaction . at zero temperature ,",
    "the above three interactions give the same eos for asymmetric nuclear matter . by analyzing liquid - gas phase transition in hot neutron - rich nuclear matter with the above three interactions , we find that the boundary of the phase - coexistence region is very sensitive to the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "a softer symmetry energy leads to a higher critical pressure and a larger area of the phase - coexistence region .",
    "in addition , the area of phase - coexistence region are also seen to be sensitive to the isospin and momentum dependence of the nuclear interaction . for the isoscalar momentum - dependent emdyi interaction ,",
