    "previous work@xcite on dilute emulsions has shown that , when coarsening is solely caused by a diffusive flux of dissolved dispersed - phase molecules between droplets ( ostwald ripening@xcite ) , coarsening may be prevented by the addition of a sufficient number of molecules that are insoluble in the continuous phase and hence _ trapped _ within droplets .",
    "the trapped molecules provide an osmotic pressure which counteracts the laplace pressure due to surface tension@xcite ( which drives coarsening ) ; resulting in ` osmotic stabilisation ' . a quantitative criterion for stability , valid even for emulsions with polydispersity in both the droplets sizes and number of trapped molecules they contain , was given in @xcite .",
    "it was also found in @xcite that for an ` insufficiently stabilised ' emulsion ( without enough trapped species to obey the required criterion ) , the subsequent coarsening was qualitatively unaltered from that without any of the trapped species @xcite .",
    "the only effect was is to reduce the effective volume fraction of the coarsening droplets by an amount corresponding to the final volume of a population of small droplets that attain coexistence with the coarsened bulk phase .",
    "the latter are prevented from entirely dissolving by the trapped molecules they contain .",
    "when the effective volume fraction is reduced to zero , full stability is achieved .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss whether analogous conditions exist for the osmotic stabilisation of concentrated emulsions and foams containing trapped insoluble molecules in the dispersed phase ; we again consider both the monodisperse and the polydisperse case .",
    "previously the use of nitrogen as a trapped species to stabilise foams has been investigated with theory@xcite , experiment@xcite , and computer simulations@xcite , but theoretical conditions for stability of foams with nonspherical bubbles were not found .",
    "the use of other trapped gases to inhibit dissolution ( as opposed to coarsening ) of spherical bubbles is addressed in@xcite where the effect of condensation of the included gases is also addressed ; we do not consider this here . in our work , we treat the idealised case of a fully insoluble trapped species ( perfect trapping ) whereas in many cases the results will be modified by residual solubility effects ( considered for the dilute case in@xcite ) .",
    "some gases are , however , practically insoluble in water , for example c@xmath6f@xmath7 @xcite ; and in the case of emulsions , the insoluble limit is easily achieved ( by using oligomeric species ) . for simplicity",
    "we do not consider the effects of residual solubility in the present work .    from now on",
    "we use mainly the language of foams , in which the trapped and soluble gas are treated as ideal , but the work is also applicable to dense emulsions whose droplets contain an ideal mixture of soluble and trapped molecules .",
    "the only distinction between these cases is that foams are compressible , but in fact much of the paper concerns _ effectively incompressible _ foams , in which pressure differences between bubbles are negligible compared with their mean pressures , and the total bubble volume is conserved .",
    "the osmotic stabilisation of foams is a far more complex proposition than for dilute emulsions . in a dilute emulsion ,",
    "each droplet is spherical with an internal pressure that is increased by the droplets laplace pressure , which is directly related to the bubble",
    "s volume through its spherical geometry , and equals @xmath8 for a droplet of radius @xmath9 and surface tension @xmath10 .",
    "since nonspherical foam bubbles in contact have no simple relationship between their volume and surface area , there is no direct relationship , in a concentrated foam , between a bubble s pressure and its volume .",
    "a bubble @xmath1 with a radius of curvature @xmath11 at its plateau borders has a laplace pressure of @xmath12 , and an internal pressure of @xmath13 . given a connected domain of the liquid phase , the atmospheric pressure @xmath3 equals the pressure in the plateau borders ( we ignore the effects of gravity throughout ) .",
    "the drier the foam , the smaller the borders and the larger the laplace pressure , so that if osmotic stabilisation of a foam or emulsion required the pressure of trapped molecules to balance the laplace pressure ( as it does in the dilute case ) osmotic stabilisation would be hard to achieve .",
    "however , another relevant length scale is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the volume of bubble @xmath1 .",
    "since the curvature of adjacent bubble - bubble faces are of order @xmath16 , the pressure differences between adjacent bubbles ( which are responsible for coarsening ) , are of order @xmath17 .",
    "so if the osmotic stabilisation of a foam merely requires the partial pressure of trapped molecules to balance @xmath18 , then osmotic stabilisation is a reasonable proposition .",
    "we shall confirm below that this is so .",
    "the reduction in the driving force for coarsening from the level suggested by the laplace pressure has long been recognised ( see e.g. , @xcite ) but the implications of this for stabilisation by trapped species has not previously been addressed in detail .    in what follows we first give in section [ dilutefoams ] some results for the dilute case ( based on @xcite ) , and then investigate what factors determine the pressure within concentrated foam bubbles .",
    "we follow the approach of princen@xcite , and study the osmotic compression ( at atmospheric pressure @xmath3 ) of previously spherical foam bubbles by an osmotic pressure @xmath4 .",
    "section [ compressed / drained ] discusses the disjoining pressures between bubbles , the uniformity or otherwise of the osmotic pressure @xmath4 , and the condition for mechanical equilibrium with an excess bulk gas phase created by coarsening .",
    "the increase in a bubble s pressure above that of a bulk gas is defined by @xmath19 , and we argue that typically @xmath20 .",
    "this is explicitly confirmed in section [ 2dmodel ] for princen s monodisperse 2d model .",
    "we call @xmath5 the _ geometric pressure _ and identify it ( rather than laplace pressure ) as the driving force for coarsening , in general .",
    "a formal condition for osmotic stabilisation is derived in section [ stabfoamcond ] , and examined for various limiting geometries .",
    "we discuss @xmath5 for polydisperse foams in section [ 2dpolysystems ] , and consider exceptions to our estimate that @xmath20 which might arise under certain conditions ( which we argue to be uncommon ) .",
    "we then use the geometric pressure to further investigate the stability requirements of polydisperse foams .",
    "the coarsening of insufficiently stabilised foams is studied in sections [ coarsenfchapt]-[fys ] , starting with a simple mean - field model in section [ rapidr ] . by considering dissipation rates for the diffusive flux of gas between bubbles and for the viscous rearrangement of bubbles , we are able to predict ( as a function of various parameters ) the rate - limiting mechanism and the associated growth rate ( section [ dissiprates ] ) .",
    "section [ elasticd ] shows that when bubble rearrangements are sufficiently rare , elastic stresses may arrest coarsening .",
    "section [ fys ] extends this to the case of a finite yield strain beyond which bubble rearrangements will cause the foam to flow , finding that a foam s initial state then determines whether coarsening will still occur .",
    "we conclude in section [ conclusions ] with a brief summary and discussion of our results .",
    "a `` dilute foam '' comprises of spherical gas bubbles floating freely in a solvent .",
    "following @xcite , we treat the bubbles as macroscopic objects and neglect their entropy of translation .",
    "firstly we consider the size ( and hence composition ) at which spherical bubbles , containing both soluble and trapped gas molecules , may coexist with a bulk gas phase ( for example , formed by one bubble in the foam becoming macroscopic ) .",
    "the gas pressure @xmath21 within a spherical bubble labelled @xmath1 is increased above the atmospheric pressure by its laplace pressure @xmath8 : @xmath22    we consider bubbles with @xmath23 soluble gas molecules and @xmath24 trapped gas molecules , and treat the gases as ideal .",
    "then @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , @xmath27 are the partial pressures of the soluble and trapped gas molecules respectively , and for the soluble gas molecules @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the chemical potential of a bulk gas phase of soluble molecules at atmospheric pressure @xmath3 . using eqs.[dilp_i],[dilmu1 ] and @xmath30 , we may write @xmath31 as @xmath32 so that when @xmath33 , @xmath34 and bubbles may coexist with a bulk gas phase ( at pressure @xmath3 ) . using the ideal gas law for the trapped species @xmath35 , such coexistence requires @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "this expression determines a ` coexistence volume ' , @xmath38 , at which the laplace pressure and the partial pressure of trapped gas balance .",
    "solving for @xmath38 we have @xmath39 this is identical to the coexistence volume for a dilute incompressible emulsion droplet , of interfacial tension @xmath10 , containing @xmath24 molecules of a trapped species @xcite .    at coexistence with a bulk gas phase , @xmath40 and @xmath41 ,",
    "so from the ideal gas law the number of soluble gas molecules in bubbles is @xmath42 similarly in two dimensions , dilute ( circular ) bubbles will coexist with a bulk gas phase only if their areas @xmath43 , with @xmath44 they then contain @xmath45 soluble gas molecules with @xmath46",
    "now we consider `` nondilute foams '' in which bubbles press on one another and are distorted into nonspherical shapes@xcite .",
    "following princen@xcite , we consider the compression of a previously dilute foam under an osmotic pressure @xmath4 .    in a nondilute foam",
    "a typical bubble s interface consists of gently curved faces which contact adjacent bubbles , and highly curved regions at the plateau borders .",
    "although bubble faces press on one another with a disjoining pressure , this typically results in a negligible direct contribution to the free energy@xcite ; we may assume that the disjoining forces only _ indirectly _ affects a bubble s free energy , by distorting its shape and increasing surface area .",
    "put differently , throughout the foam the surface tension @xmath10 is taken constant , independent of the volume fraction of gas present .",
    "following equation [ dilmu1 ] ( the ideal gas law ) we obtain @xmath47 for nondilute bubbles as @xmath48 , where @xmath29 is the chemical potential of a bulk gas of soluble molecules subject to pressure @xmath49 .",
    "were such a bulk gas to arise by coarsening , @xmath49 would balance both the atmospheric pressure @xmath3 and the osmotic pressure @xmath4 ; defining @xmath50 we require @xmath51 ( see figure [ bulkgasp ] ) @xcite .",
    "so for nondilute foam bubbles we have @xmath52 as we compress the system with a semipermeable membrane , the previously spherical bubbles will distort in shape and the continuous phase will flow@xcite so that the additional pressure is evenly distributed amongst bubbles .",
    "( this contrasts with granular materials for example@xcite . ) in the simplest scenario of 2d , monodisperse foams , the bubbles are compressed into monodisperse hexagons with ` rounded ' corners , and equal internal pressures .",
    "however , compression of a general polydisperse foam will result in bubbles deforming into various shapes ; a given bubble will have a pressure which depends not only on its volume ( as for spherical bubbles ) , but on the arrangement and pressures of _ all _ of its neighbours .",
    "the above discussion may be clarified by noting that bubble interfaces which press on one another , do so with a radius of curvature at most of order @xmath16 ( where @xmath9 is the radius of a bubble with the same volume in an uncompressed state ) .",
    "hence pressure differences between bubbles are of order @xmath18 .",
    "so if @xmath4 exceeds @xmath18 then the increase in bubbles pressures will ( to within terms of order @xmath18 ) , be homogeneous throughout the foam @xcite .",
    "so we define the increase in a bubble s pressure above that of bulk gas ( @xmath53 ) , by @xmath54 and expect @xmath5 to be of order @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath5 reduces to the laplace pressure of the @xmath1th dilute , uncompressed ( @xmath55 ) , spherical 3d bubble , for which the increase in pressure above a coexisting bulk gas is @xmath56 .",
    "but in a compressed state @xmath5 is no longer the laplace pressure , for the latter is @xmath57 , with @xmath11 the radius of curvature at a plateau border of droplet @xmath1 .",
    "since we consider an ideal mixture of soluble and trapped gases , then eq .",
    "[ pgdef ] requires @xmath58 , which substituting into eq .",
    "[ munonideal ] gives @xmath59 so since a bulk gas formed by coarsening has @xmath60 , a bubble can coexist with a coarsened bulk gas phase when @xmath61 .",
    "we note @xmath5 as defined by eq .",
    "[ pgdef ] is generally not easy to calculate from geometric considerations .",
    "nonetheless the origin of @xmath5 for a spherical bubble is geometrical , and @xmath5 of a nondilute foam bubble is determined by packing geometry , so we refer to @xmath5 as a bubble s `` geometric pressure '' . to confirm the reasonableness of our arguments for the magnitude of @xmath5 ,",
    "the following section considers a 2d model for which @xmath21 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are exactly calculable .",
    "we first clarify what it means for a foam to be `` incompressible '' .",
    "if @xmath62 then variations in a bubble s pressure are negligible compared with its actual internal pressure .",
    "so a bubble s gas density is approximately unaffected by its geometric pressure , and hence we may treat such bubbles as effectively incompressible .",
    "we emphasise that bubbles with @xmath63 may only be treated as incompressible with respect to _ coarsening _ ( which changes their geometric pressures ) ; such systems are _ not _ incompressible under changes in @xmath3 or @xmath4 ( which changes their laplace pressures as well ) .",
    "we now study a monodisperse , incompressible 2-dimensional foam , at osmotic pressure @xmath4 .",
    "( in appendix [ fbalance ] an alternative argument confirms the results for an equivalent , but compressible model . ) for @xmath64 monodisperse bubbles will form an hexagonal array , with bubbles distorted into approximately hexagonal shapes but with rounded corners ( see figure [ 2dmodelfig ] ) . for simplicity the film thickness between adjacent bubbles",
    "is taken to be negligible .",
    "we note that an equivalent system of osmotically compressed , monodisperse _ cylindrical _ emulsion droplets was considered by princen@xcite .",
    "princen s calculation for the osmotic pressure is used later .    since the bubbles are taken to be incompressible , the osmotic pressure @xmath4 does work by removal of the continuous liquid phase from bubbles plateau borders .",
    "writing the area of liquid associated with each bubble as @xmath65 ( with @xmath65 given as the sum of one third of the volume of liquid at each of its plateau borders ) , then since we consider a monodisperse system with bubbles of area @xmath66 , the osmotic pressure is given by@xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the interfacial length of bubble @xmath1 .",

    "[ pgdef ] we defined @xmath69 . since the monodisperse system considered here has hexagonal symmetry , by analogy with the laplace pressure of a circular bubble we propose that @xmath5 may be calculated by considering the increase in a bubble s interfacial length with an isotropic expansion at fixed liquid area @xmath65 .",

    "having established a general definition of geometric pressure ( eq . [ pgdef ] ) , and shown that it corresponds ( in at least one special case ) to an isotropic expansion at fixed liquid content , we now use conservation of the total number of gas molecules and total number of bubbles to derive a criterion to ensure the formation of a stable distribution of foam bubbles .",
    "we take the bubble size distribution to be composed of two parts , a ` coarsening ' part of the distribution , and a ` stable ' part consisting of bubbles which have shrunk to a stable size at which they coexist with the coarsening bubbles . for a sufficient quantity of trapped species the assumption of the bubble distribution having a coarsening part",
    "is found to be inconsistent , enabling us to derive a stability criterion for foams .",
    "these arguments have strong similarities to those in @xcite , but are considerably generalised .",
    "we take @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 as the number densities of bubbles overall , in the stable part of the distribution , and in the coarsening part of the distribution respectively .",

    "however , the above condition enables us to investigate the requirements for stability .",
    "this is done in sections [ exact ] and [ sdf ] below .",

    "the area of liquid associated with each bubble becomes negligible compared to @xmath137 as the foam becomes increasingly dry .",
    "note also that the dry monodisperse hexagonal foam is , even without trapped species , already dynamically stable with respect to infinitesimal volume changes of a single cell but not with respect to geometric reorganisation so as to create five - sided and seven - sided cells .",
    "such a foam is , however , unstable with respect to homogenous cell shrinkage throughout the system ( with the excess gas forming a bulk coexisiting phase ) , whereas sufficient trapped species , as calculated above , will restore full thermodynamic stability in this sense .",
    "we accept that the distinction between stability and metastability becomes blurred , especially as the geometry of the foam becomes more complex .",
    "the edges of bubbles in a reasonably dry 2d foam ( @xmath138 ) , meet with an angle approximately equal to @xmath139 .",
    "if the edges met with an angle of _ exactly _ @xmath139 , then bubbles would need to have _ exactly equal _ radii of curvature at their plateau borders , and hence _ equal _ bubble pressures @xmath94 .",
    "since the curvatures between adjacent bubbles remain of order @xmath140 , then as a foam becomes increasingly dry , bubbles pressure differences become increasingly small compared with the mean bubble pressure ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "so provided a polydisperse foam is sufficiently dry , then @xmath20 and @xmath142 .    in a sufficiently _ wet _ and polydisperse foam ,",

    "we will assume that for a given @xmath4 the distribution of @xmath24 is sufficiently narrow that we may neglect any tiny bubbles residing wholly within plateau borders of larger ones ( see above , and appendix [ polydappendix ] ) .",

    "[ tdepfstab ] in more detail . by assuming that @xmath146 and @xmath24",

    "( that is , there will always be some number of trapped molecules per bubble beyond which coarsening will be prevented . )",
    "equation [ gammacurve ] shows that , for a monodisperse 2d foam , @xmath158 is bounded above even in the dry limit ( in contrast to the laplace pressure ) . also since @xmath159 ( see appendix [ fbalance ] ) , then for @xmath157 to increase without bound , @xmath146 and @xmath9 will need to be correlated in a very specific way . on balance , all these arguments suggests that @xmath157 remains bounded as a polydisperse foam evolves .",

    "the trapped molecules prevent bubbles from entirely disappearing . the resulting foam morphology and coarsening kinetics",
    "will be determined by two main factors .",
    "the first is the ` excess volume fraction ' of dispersed phase , defined as the total volume fraction of gas which ultimately will coexist with a stable ensemble of shrunken bubbles , in osmotic and mechanical equilibrium with it : this is the amount of gas actually available for coarsening .",
    "the second factor is the ease with which shrunken bubbles may rearrange to allow larger bubbles to coarsen .",
    "the excess volume fraction of disperse phase , determines a foam s expected late - stage morphology ( see figure [ excessfig ] ) :    1 .   _",
    "no excess volume fraction : _ the foam is stable .",
    "_ very low excess volume fractions : _ larger bubbles are surrounded by a ` sea ' of shrunken bubbles .",
    "competitive coarsening between larger bubbles requires a gas flux _ through _ the sea of smaller bubbles .",
    "_ very high excess volume fraction : _ larger bubbles are _ decorated _ by collections of smaller bubbles at their _ vertices _ , with their _ faces _ impinging on other large bubbles .",
    "_ intermediate volume fractions : _ structures between the previous two extremes .",
    "[ lowexcess ]    [ highexcess ]    in what follows , we focus on the case of low but nonzero excess volume fraction .",
    "here coarsening of larger bubbles will require rearrangements of the shrunken bubbles to prevent the build up of excess elastic strains ( which will otherwise halt coarsening , as shown below ) .",
    "we envisage four scenarios :    1 .   _ inviscid rearrangements : _ bubble rearrangements occur easily , and with negligible dissipation of energy .",
    "viscous rearrangements : _ bubbles can rearrange , but resist doing so and hence slow the rate of coarsening .",
    "_ negligible rearrangements ( elastic medium ) : _ bubbles grow within an effectively elastic medium , which may eventually arrest coarsening .",
    "_ elasto  plastic rearrangements : _ there is a maximum yield strain beyond which rearrangements allow flow of the shrunken  bubble sea , but below which it behaves as an elastic medium .",
    "we expect rearrangements to occur easily in a sufficiently wet foam , but rearrangements in a very dry foam to occur rarely or not at all .",
    "so we expect the scenarios from @xmath167 , to become more applicable as foams become increasingly dry .",
    "since _ both _ rearrangements and diffusion of disperse phase are required for coarsening to occur , coarsening will proceed with a rate determined by the _ slowest _ process .",
    "this contrasts , for example , with phase separation in a binary fluid , where the coarsening rate is governed by the _ fastest _ process ( with diffusive coarsening at early times , viscous hydrodynamic coarsening at intermediate times , and inertial hydrodynamic coarsening at late times @xcite ) . in the present case",
    "rapid coarsening may initially be limited by viscous forces , then later as coarsening slows , viscous forces will become negligible and coarsening diffusion - limited .",
    "note that a similar classification of kinetic regimes may in part be applicable to the coarsening dynamics of foams containing no trapped species .",
    "it would be appealing , perhaps , to study this case in detail first , before addressing the situation where trapped species are present .",
    "however , the latter case is actually a lot simpler , at least in the case of low excess volume fractions ( figure [ excessfig ] , left ) considered here . this is because the actively coarsening bubbles are effectively decoupled by a sea of passive shrunken bubbles ;",

    "we consider a mean - field model for the coarsening of a small excess volume fraction , in which grown bubbles are already sufficiently large that they contain a negligible quantity of trapped molecules , and have an approximately spherical shape ( figure [ lowexcess ] ) .",
    "hence large bubbles have @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "we restrict ourselves to incompressible foams ( in the sense described in section [ compressed / drained ] ) , and take shrunken bubbles to have an approximately constant size @xmath170 , with @xmath171 . an average pressure @xmath172 of soluble gas in shrunken bubbles at distance @xmath96 from a grown bubble s centre is obtained by coarse - graining over bubbles at @xmath96 , and we assume @xmath173 is the same for all grown bubbles .",
    "we at first take rearrangements to be inviscid , so that bubble growth is determined by the rate at which soluble gas diffuses through bubble - bubble interfaces in the shrunken bubble ` sea ' ; this assumption is relaxed in section [ dissiprates ] .",
    "consider the flux of gas from shrunken bubbles at radius @xmath96 to adjacent bubbles at radius @xmath174 , see figure [ continuum_sea ] .",
    "following the approach of von neumann ( see @xcite ) , we take the flux of gas between two bubbles as proportional to both the pressure difference of their soluble gas , and the surface area through which the gas may pass . defining a flux velocity per unit pressure @xmath175 , we obtain an average volume flux of gas from bubbles at @xmath96 to bubbles at @xmath176 of @xmath177 since @xmath178 then @xmath179 , so solving for a steady state gas flux with @xmath180 , we obtain a radial flux @xmath181 and a droplet growth rate @xmath182 where we used @xmath183 , and wrote @xmath184 . for an incompressible system all bubbles",

    "the volume of a molecule in a droplet is similar to that in the continuous phase , so when a dissolved molecule is incorporated into a drop , the increase in the droplet s volume equals the volume of liquid previously displaced by the molecule .",
    "hence the only displacement of liquid is that already accounted for by the stokes - einstein drag on the molecule as it diffuses through the continuous liquid phase . on the other hand ,",
    "since the volume per gas molecule in a bubble is much larger than its volume when dissolved in solution , the viscous dissipation _ may _ be relevant for coarsening of dilute foam bubbles in a structureless fluid .",

    "so when @xmath239 coarsening is diffusion limited , and when @xmath240 coarsening is limited by viscous dissipation . here we estimate the ratio for plausible foam parameters .    comparing eqs .",
    "[ invisciddissip ] and [ viscousdissip ] , we see that @xmath241 in terms of a molar concentration @xmath242 , the molar volume @xmath243 of gas in bubbles at pressure @xmath244 , and the gas constant @xmath245 , we have @xmath246 at room temperature and atmospheric pressure we take typical values of @xmath247j , @xmath248m@xmath249 , @xmath250m@xmath251 , @xmath252m@xmath253 , and @xmath254nm@xmath165s , ( eg . for co@xmath6 gas bubbles in water @xcite ) . taking @xmath255 m , gives @xmath256 so that for micron - sized foam bubbles , viscous dissipation will be observed for @xmath195 smaller than @xmath257 .",

    ", it is well known that , _ in the absence of coarsening _ , a foam can exhibit a finite macroscopic yield strain , below which there may be occasional local rearrangements but these are insufficient to allow plastic deformation of the medium as a whole @xcite .",
    "our physical picture is that the shrunken  bubble sea , which is fully stabilised against coarsening by virtue of the trapped species that it contains , can then offer elastic resistance to the growth of an isolated large bubble , even though the latter is at lower chemical potential of gas than other , less large bubbles that have coarsened elsewhere in the system .",
    "the elastic coarsening inhibition mechanism that we advance is thus only possible because of the stability against coarsening of the shrunken  bubble sea .",

    "the morphology of an insufficiently stabilised foam ( containing inadequate levels of a trapped species ) , is determined by the ` excess volume fraction ' of dispersed phase ; this will form a bulk gas phase if the system is allowed to reach full equilibrium ( _ i.e. , _ subject only to the constraint that the trapped species stay in their designated droplets and coalescence is absent , which with trapped species present will ensure conservation of droplet number ) .",
    "the kinetics of coarsening will be determined either by the rate of diffusion of gas between bubbles or the rate at which shrunken bubbles rearrange , with the slowest process determining the bubble growth rate .",
    "we studied coarsening of a small excess volume fraction , finding diffusion limited growth to result in @xmath338 ( as opposed to @xmath339 as arises in foams without trapped molecules@xcite ) , and viscous limited growth to give @xmath340 . for typical parameters",
    "we expect diffusion limited growth to be more common , with viscous limited growth more likely to be observed if the liquid viscosity is high , the temperature is high , and the pressure is low@xcite . under conditions of negligible bubble rearrangements , the buildup of elastic stresses among the sea of shrunken , stabilised bubbles will arrest coarsening of well - separated large bubbles and ` elastically stabilise ' the entire foam .",
    "this can sometimes occur when there is a finite yield strain ; whether a foam will be elastically stabilised is then determined by the foam s initial state ( and the yield strain @xmath303 ) .",
    "thus osmotic compression of a partially coarsened _ dilute _ foam , may _ halt _ coarsening and elastically stabilise the foam ; the further the foam has coarsened initially , the more likely this is to occur .",
    "our work applies , substantially unchanged , to concentrated emulsions . as with nondilute foams the disjoining energy between repelling droplets in emulsions",
    "may usually be neglected @xcite , and the osmotic pressure of trapped molecules in droplets equals the partial pressure of trapped gas molecules in bubbles ( so long as both are treated as ideal @xcite ) .",
    "hence if we replace the volume per gas molecule @xmath341 with the molecular volume of disperse phase in droplets @xmath342 , and also replace @xmath343 with @xmath344 , then most of the above work applies equally well to concentrated emulsions .",
    "we adopt a similar approach to one previously used by princen@xcite , which will enable us to determine the order of magnitude of @xmath72 when bubble sizes are polydisperse .",
    "unlike the one in the main text , this approach is equally valid for compressible and incompressible bubbles .    consider a semipermeable membrane with a shape which follows the top surface of a line of hexagonal bubbles ( see figure [ monobrane ] ) ,    so that bubbles remain hexagonal in shape .",
    "then since the membrane does nt move , the total force on the membrane due to @xmath345 must balance the total force on the membrane acting from below .",

    "<S> in the absence of coalescence , coarsening of emulsions ( and foams ) is controlled by molecular diffusion of the dispersed phase species from one emulsion droplet ( or foam bubble ) to another . </S>",

    "<S> in fact , for princen s 2d emulsion model , @xmath5 is only 5% larger in the dry limit than the dilute limit . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that osmotic stabilisation of dense systems typically requires a pressure of trapped molecules in each droplet that is comparable to the laplace pressures the same droplets would have if they were spherical , as opposed to the much larger laplace pressures actually present in the system . </S>",
