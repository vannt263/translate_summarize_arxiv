    "the electron - proton collider hera started operation in the summer of 1992 .",
    "the proton beam energy was 820 gev while the electron beam energy was 27.5 gev .",
    "the @xmath025 nb@xmath1 of data collected by the experiments zeus and h1 in the first running period extended the kinematic range covered by deep inelastic scattering , dis , measurements by two orders of magnitude in both @xmath2 , the four - momentum transfer squared , and @xmath3 , the fraction of the proton four - momentum carried by the struck quark .",
    "the proton structure function was extracted from the data and observed to rise rapidly with decreasing @xmath3 @xcite ; a dramatic result , not expected by many .    in the years 1992 - 1997",
    "h1 and zeus have each collected a luminosity of @xmath01 pb@xmath1 using electron beams and @xmath050 pb@xmath1 using positron beams .",
    "these data have been used to make measurements which test the electroweak standard model , sm , and the theory of the strong interactions , qcd , in both neutral current , nc , and charged current , cc , dis .",
    "jet analyses in dis and photoproduction have been used to address fundamental issues in qcd .",
    "the observation of diffraction in dis has led to a careful investigation of the transition from the kinematic region in which perturbative qcd is valid to the region where phenomenological models based on regge theory must be applied ( see for example @xcite and @xcite and references therein ) .    during the running period august 1998 to april 1999 @xmath020 pb@xmath1 of @xmath4 data were delivered with a proton beam energy of 920 gev .",
    "the data collected by h1 and zeus will be used to study the dependence of the nc and cc dis cross sections on the charge of the lepton beam .",
    "the hera experiments will continue to take data until may 2000 when a long , 9 month , shutdown is scheduled .",
    "the shutdown will be used to upgrade the hera accelerator and the collider detectors .",
    "the hera luminosity will be increased by a factor of five and longitudinal lepton beam polarisation will be provided for zeus and h1 . the physics motivation for this major upgrade programme",
    "is discussed in detail in reference @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite also contains a discussion of the physics potential of hera were polarised proton beams and beams of heavy nuclei to be provided .",
    "these interesting possibilities will not be discussed further here .",
    "this report is organised as follows : section 2 contains a selection of current results from h1 and zeus which will benefit from more data or from improvements in the quality of the data expected to come from the detector upgrades ; the hera machine and the collider detector upgrades are reviewed in section 3 ; section 4 contains a selection of key physics topics which will be addressed after the upgrade ; finally , section 5 contains a summary .",
    "the wealth of data provided by the successful operation of hera over the past seven years has allowed a set of open questions to be clearly defined . since a discussion of each open question",
    "can not be attempted here , the case for the upgrade of the accelerator and of the collider detectors will be made using three key examples .",
    "the double differential cross section for @xmath5 nc dis may be written in the form @xmath6 = \\frac{2\\pi\\alpha^{2}}{xq^{4 } } y_{+}\\tilde{\\sigma } ^{\\rm nc}_{e^{\\pm}p}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 with @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the @xmath5 centre of mass energy , @xmath10 is the fine structure constant and @xmath11 is referred to as the reduced cross section .",
    "the structure functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 contain parton density functions , pdfs , and electromagnetic and weak couplings @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal structure function @xmath14 arises from qcd corrections to the naive quark parton model and makes a significant contribution to the nc cross section only at low @xmath2 .",
    "the structure function @xmath12 can be written as the sum of two terms @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 contains the purely electromagnetic contribution , while @xmath17 receives contributions from the parity conserving terms which arise from @xmath18 exchange and photon-@xmath18 interference .",
    "zeus and h1 have measured the structure function @xmath12 over the kinematic range @xmath19 and @xmath20 and extracted @xmath16 from these measurements @xcite .",
    "the error in @xmath16 is now dominated by systematic uncertainties over a large part of the this range .",
    "fits to the data using next to leading order , nlo , qcd have been used to extract the gluon density , @xmath21 , with a precision varying from 20% at @xmath22 , @xmath23 to 15% at @xmath24 , @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "this is an indirect determination of @xmath21 since the positron scatters from a quark .",
    "a quantity more directly sensitive to the gluon density is the charm production cross section .",
    "this may be measured using a sample of events which contain a @xmath26 meson reconstructed using the decay chain @xmath27 .",
    "both h1 and zeus have performed such a measurement in dis and in photoproduction @xcite .",
    "a sensitive test of qcd can be made by comparing the measured charm cross sections to the cross sections obtained from the scaling violations of @xmath16 . at present",
    "the data are not sufficiently precise to allow a quantitative comparison to be made .    in order to investigate the extent to which the gluon distribution extracted from the scaling violation of @xmath16 agrees with that inferred from the charm production cross sections it is necessary to extend the range of @xmath3 and @xmath2 over which @xmath16 is measured to high precision so increasing the precision with which @xmath21 can be extracted . at the same time",
    "a much larger charm data set is required to reduce the errors on the charm cross sections .",
    "the hera luminosity upgrade combined with the improved charm tagging efficiency to be provided by the detector upgrades will make it possible to address the issue of whether the gluon distribution extracted from @xmath16 is also that required to describe the charm production cross sections .      the effect of @xmath18 exchange on the nc dis cross section has been observed at high @xmath2 .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure [ fig : fig1 ] where the single differential cross sections @xmath28 and @xmath29 are compared with the expectations of the sm @xcite .",
    "the sm , including the @xmath18 exchange contribution , describes the data while a calculation in which the @xmath18 exchange contribution is ignored is in clear conflict with the data .",
    "the sm predicts that the @xmath30 interference contribution to nc @xmath31 scattering is destructive while in @xmath4 scattering it is constructive .",
    "the measured single differential cross sections @xmath28 and @xmath32 , shown in figure [ fig : fig2 ] , are consistent with this expectation @xcite",
    ". it will be possible to extract the structure function @xmath13 by combining the @xmath4 and @xmath31 data , however , with the luminosities currently available the precision of the measurement will be dominated by the statistical uncertainty . to improve",
    "the measurement will require a significant increase in luminosity and some improvements in the detection of the scattered lepton at high @xmath3 and at high @xmath2 .",
    ", to the sm prediction using the cteq4d parton densities and fixing the z mass , @xmath33 , at its nominal value of 91.175  gev .",

    "for @xmath39 the data points at the highest @xmath2 lie above the sm expectation . in order to establish this effect as something other than a statistical fluctuation requires a significant increase in the size of the nc data set .     the reduced cross section , as defined in equation 1 , compared with the expectations of the standard model evaluated using the mrst @xcite pdfs and the result of the h1 nlo qcd fit .",

    "the solid line shows the result of a fit to the data . ]",
    "it is in the nature of searches for physics beyond the sm to push to the edges of phase space .",
    "hence , such analyses are always in need of a large increase in data .",
    "searches for physics beyond the sm at hera are reviewed elsewhere in these proceedings @xcite .",
    "the limits presented in reference @xcite indicate that hera plays a crucial role in exploring the full panorama of new physics precisely because it is the worlds only @xmath40 collider .",
    "as such the hera collider experiments have the potential to make decisive contributions in the search for r - parity violating susy , leptoquarks , contact interactions and much more besides .",
    "the goals of the hera upgrade programme are to provide an increase of a factor of five in luminosity and to provide longitudinal lepton beam polarisation for zeus and h1 . over a six year running period",
    "it is anticipated that a total luminosity of 1000 pb@xmath1 will be delivered @xcite .",
    "the key parameters of the upgraded machine are summarised in table 1 @xcite .",
    "the five fold increase in luminosity is to be achieved by stronger focusing of the lepton and proton beams . in order to achieve the strong focusing required superconducting magnets",
    "must be installed close to the interaction region inside the h1 and zeus detectors . in order to calculate the synchrotron radiation background",
    "a maximum lepton beam energy , @xmath41 , of 30 gev was used . in operation",
    "@xmath41 will be reduced somewhat to ensure that the rf system performs reliably at high current .",

    "figure 4 shows the build up of polarisation during hera running in 1998 @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic value of @xmath060% is routinely obtained in hera .",
    "spin rotators have been operating at the hermes interaction point for several years and are routinely providing 60% longitudinal polarisation .",
    "the present performance falls only slightly short of the design goal of 70% lepton beam polarisation at hera after the upgrade .",
    "the collider detector upgrades focus on providing optimal performance for charm and beauty tagging and for the reconstruction of the scattered lepton at high @xmath3 and high @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "charm tagging is strongly enhanced by the ability to identify displaced vertices .",
    "hence zeus will install a silicon micro - vertex detector .",
    "the boost of the lepton - quark centre of mass system throws the decay products of charmed particles preferentially into the forward direction .",
    "hence the zeus micro - vertex detector will be equipped with a set of ` wheels ' to cover the forward region .",
    "h1 already operates a micro - vertex detector . in order to enhance the charm tagging efficiency",
    "a forward silicon tracker will be installed and a set of ` wheels ' will be added to the backward silicon tracker in order to measure the azimuthal coordinate so complementing the existing ` wheels ' which measure the radial coordinate . to further enhance track reconstruction in the forward direction both collaborations will upgrade the forward tracking system @xcite .",
    "h1 will install a system of planar drift chambers while zeus is building a set of planar straw tube trackers .",
    "these detectors will significantly enhance track reconstruction in the forward direction and so lead to improved charm tagging and enhanced reconstruction of the scattered lepton particularly at high @xmath3 and at high @xmath2",
    ".    in view of the redesigned lepton and proton beams both experiments are planning upgrades to the luminosity measurement systems and h1 plans to upgrade the system of roman pots used to detect elastically scattered protons .",
    "both collaborations plan trigger upgrades in order to increase flexibility and selectivity , particularly for events containing charmed particles .",
    "following the hera upgrade the proton will be probed using each of the four possible combinations of lepton beam charge and polarisation .",
    "the combination of high luminosity and polarisation will lead to a rich and diverse programme of measurements which can only be sketched below using a few examples .",
    "a detailed description of the physics opportunities afforded by the upgrade is to be found in reference @xcite .",
    "the large data volume will allow @xmath12 to be extracted with an accuracy of @xmath03% over the kinematic range @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "this estimate is based on an assumed luminosity of 1000 pb@xmath1 and reasonable assumptions for systematic uncertainties .",
    "such a measurement will represent a significant improvement over current results . if qcd evolution codes which go beyond next to leading order become available and a careful study of the dependence of the systematic errors on the kinematic variables is made it will be possible to determine @xmath57 from the scaling violations of @xmath12 with a precision of @xmath58 .",
    "the gluon distribution will also be extracted from such a fit .",
    "the result of a fit in which systematic errors are handled in an optimal way and assuming a luminosity of 1000 pb@xmath1 is shown in figure 5 .",

    "reasonable estimates of systematic uncertainties have been included in the fit . ]",
    "the combination of high luminosity and high charm tagging efficiency transforms the measurement of the charm contribution to @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "for example , figure 6 shows the precision on @xmath62 expected from a luminosity of 500 pb@xmath1",
    ". the precision will be sufficient to allow a detailed study of the charm production cross section to be made .",
    "the lifetime tag provided by the silicon micro - vertex detector allows the tagging of @xmath63-quarks .",

    "further , by identifying charm in cc dis it will be possible to determine the strange quark contribution to the proton structure function @xmath12 with an accuracy of between 15% and 30% @xcite .    in summary , following the upgrade the hera collider experiments will make a complete survey of the parton content of the proton .",
    "the high luminosity provided by the upgrade will allow access to low cross section phenomena such as the production of real @xmath72-bosons .",
    "the sm cross section for the process @xmath73 is @xmath0  1  pb @xcite which , combined with an acceptance of @xmath74 , gives a sizeable data sample for a luminosity of 1000 pb@xmath1 .",
    "the production of the @xmath72-boson at hera is sensitive to the non - abelian coupling @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of hera to non - sm couplings is comparable to the sensitivities obtained at lep and at the tevatron and complementary in that at hera the @xmath75 vertex is probed in the space - like regime .",
    "the full potential of electroweak tests at hera will be realised through measurements using polarised lepton beams @xcite .",
    "two types of electroweak test have been considered .",
    "the first involves the interpretation of nc and cc cross section measurements in terms of parameters of the sm such as the mass of the @xmath72 boson , @xmath76 , and the mass of the top quark , @xmath77 .",
    "the consistency of the sm requires that the values extracted must be in agreement with those obtained in measurements of the same parameters in other experiments .",
    "the second form of sm test involves the determination of parameters , such as the light quark nc couplings , which are not free parameters in the sm . in this case",
    "a deviation from the sm prediction would be a signal for new physics .    within the sm nc and",
    "cc dis cross sections may be written in terms of @xmath10 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 together with the mass of the @xmath18 boson , @xmath33 , and the mass of the higgs boson , @xmath78 . in order to test the consistency of the theory we may fix the values of @xmath10 and @xmath33 to those obtained at lep or elsewhere and use measurements of the nc and cc dis cross sections to place constraints in the @xmath76 , @xmath77 plane for fixed values of @xmath78 .",
    "the sm is consistent if the values of the parameters @xmath76 and @xmath77 obtained agree with the values determined in other experiments .",
    "the result of such an analysis is shown in figure 8 where one standard deviation contours in the @xmath76 , @xmath77 plane have been derived from anticipated measurements of nc and cc dis in @xmath4 scattering with an electron polarisation of @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "combining nc and cc data corresponding to a luminosity of 1000 pb@xmath1 with a top mass measurement from the tevatron with a precision of @xmath80 gev yields a measurement of @xmath76 with an error of @xmath81 mev .",

    "the sensitivity of nc dis to lepton beam polarisation is shown in figure 9(a ) .",
    "the figure shows the ratio @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the differential cross section obtained if only photon exchange is taken into account .",
    "the strong polarisation dependence of the nc cross section can be used to extract the nc couplings of the light quarks . in such an analysis the cc cross section may be used to reduce the sensitivity of the results to uncertainties in the pdfs @xcite .",
