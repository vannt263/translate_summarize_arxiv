    "physical quantities of an equilibrium macroscopic system are well characterized by their average values . however , random deviations from the average values - fluctuations - are very important since they contain important information on the system . under most circumstances",
    "the distribution of small fluctuations is gaussian  @xcite , ch .",
    "7 . however , this is not the case for small devices , which are currently studied intensively  @xcite , see  @xcite for a review .",
    "energy and temperature fluctuations in a single electron box  @xcite were considered in  @xcite ; several works experimental and theoretical , e.g. ,  @xcite , were devoted to temperature fluctuations . in the present work we will derive the distribution function for a finite fermi gas and",
    "show that its shape is determined by only one dimensionless parameter - the total heat capacity @xmath0 divided by the boltzmann constant , @xmath3 . at @xmath4",
    "we recover the well - known gaussian distribution , while at finite values of this parameter significant deviations are expected .",
    "we will analytically derive the distribution of the energies of a finite sample of the fermi gas kept at a given temperature and analyze its properties including moments and skewness absent in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "since the heat capacity of a metallic conductor of sub - micron dimensions at standard sub - kelvin experimental temperatures is of the order of @xmath5 @xcite , our results have potential impact on sensitive bolometers @xcite . in future",
    ", we plan to use the obtained distribution for analysis of heat exchange between a quantum device and a mesoscopic metallic calorimeter .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we derive general expression for the energy distribution in sec .",
    "[ general ] , which will be analyzed in sec .",
    "[ different ] . moments of the distribution are considered in sec .",
    "[ moments ] .",
    "it is convenient to calculate the fourier transform , @xmath6 , of the energy distribution function .",
    "it can be expressed in the form @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the partition function , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is temperature , while @xmath11 a micro - state is characterized by the set of quantum numbers @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the quasi - momentum . in the following , concentrating on mesoscopic electronic systems , we will consider a gas of elementary particles characterized only by the quantum number @xmath13 . according to the definitions  ( [ cf])-([en1 ] )",
    ", we calculate the characteristic function of quasiparticle energy .",
    "the energy distribution function , @xmath14 , can be calculated as the inverse fourier transform of @xmath6 as @xmath15 for the fermi gas  @xcite , @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the density of states . in the following we put @xmath18 .",
    "this assumption is valid for the two - dimensional gas , while in the three - dimensional case @xmath19 .",
    "one can show that in the limiting case @xmath20 the results differ only by renormalization of numerical constants in the expressions for the average energy and heat capacity .",
    "for realistic experimental conditions @xmath21 for a metal with fermi temperature @xmath22 k at @xmath23 k.    for @xmath24 we obtain @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the dilogarithm function . at @xmath20",
    "we expand @xmath27 then @xmath28 note that we assume that the chemical potential is fixed rather than determined by the normalization of the single - particle distribution to the total number of particles .",
    "this assumption is appropriate for an electronic system with contacts .    in the case",
    "when @xmath19 we can put @xmath29 to obtain instead of eq .",
    "( [ exp1 ] ) @xmath30 therefore , different forms of the dependence of the density of states upon the energy indeed result only in numerical constants defining the average energy and heat capacity .",
    "the difference in the numerical factors is compatible with the well known sommerfeld expansion , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "using the expansion ( [ exp1 ] ) we obtain @xmath31 the first item is responsible for the energy shift of the energy by the fermi energy @xmath32 . in our approximation the specific heat has the standard free fermi - gas expression ( for a given chemical potential ) @xmath33 then the quantity in the parentheses in eq .",
    "( [ lnf ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath34 we rewrite @xmath35 here @xmath36 . denoting @xmath37 we obtain in the exponent @xmath38    let us measure the energy deviation @xmath39 in units of @xmath40 .",
    "then we put @xmath41 to obtain for the second term @xmath42 therefore , we arrive at the expression for the distribution of dimensionless energies @xmath43 : @xmath44\\ , .\\ ] ] this is our final expression , which we have to analyze for different values of dimensionless heat capacity , @xmath45 .",
    "we compute the integral in eq .",
    "( [ pu ] ) by deforming the contour in the complex plane .",
    "the integrand is analytic in the full complex plane except for ( an essential ) singularity at @xmath46 . for large @xmath47 the argument of the exponential behaves as @xmath48 for thermodynamics it suffices to consider energies above the fermi energy @xmath49 which means @xmath50 .",
    "we may then deform the contour to the lower half plane @xmath51 .",
    "we get @xmath52 where @xmath53 is contribution from the semi circle at infinity in the lower half plane and @xmath54 from a circle around @xmath46 .",
    "graphs for @xmath67 for different heat capacities , @xmath45 , are shown in fig .",
    "one observes that at large @xmath45 the distribution is essentially gaussian , while at small @xmath45 it becomes very asymmetric .",
    "let us crudely estimate the dimensionless heat capacity , @xmath45 .",
    "the estimate reads as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the electron density . for a typical metal @xmath72 . assuming the sizes of a mesoscopic system ( in @xmath73 ) as @xmath74 @xmath75 ,",
    "we get @xmath76 and the total number of electrons is @xmath77 putting @xmath78 and @xmath79 we get @xmath80 consequently , the range of the quantity @xmath45 is @xmath81 .",
    "as we have seen , at these values of @xmath45 the energy distribution is clearly non - gaussian",
    ".      the moments of the energy distribution can be readily calculated either from the eq .",
    "( [ pu ] ) , or explicitly from the hamiltonian@xmath82 . in particular , @xmath83 where @xmath84^{-1}$ ] is the fermi function .",

    "we observe that only the vicinity of the fermi level is important for the difference @xmath86 therefore , while calculating @xmath87 we can assume constant density of states and @xmath20 . in this way we obtain @xmath88 in a similar way , we calculate @xmath89 ^ 2=3{k_{\\text{b}}}^2t^3c\\ , .\\ ] ] the skewness of the distribution is then @xmath90 obviously , the skewness vanishes as @xmath91 which is the thermodynamic limit . for a gaussian distribution ,",
    "the relationship between the 2nd and the 4th moments is @xmath92 . in the general case",
    ", an additional contribution appears , such that @xmath93\\ , .\\ ] ] the 5th moment , absent in the gaussian approximation , is @xmath94 the results obtained by numerical integration of eq .",
    "( [ pu ] ) agree with the analytic expressions given above .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that the energy distribution of a free fermi - gas with small heat capacity is non - gaussian , with a sharp cut - off at low energies .",
    "this is a natural consequence of the minimal energy of the filled fermi sea .",
    "we find that the heat capacities demonstrating strong non - gaussian features can be achieved in standard metallic nanodevices at sub - kelvin temperatures .",
