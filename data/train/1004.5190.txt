    "superlattices formed by layer - by - layer epitaxial growth of perovskite - based oxide materials are currently a subject of intense research , because of their promising technological applications as well as fundamental scientific interest@xcite . in abo@xmath0 perovskites , the a@xmath1b@xmath2o@xmath0",
    "( ii - iv ) structures consist of ( 100 ) layers of formally charge neutral ao and bo@xmath3 , while a@xmath4b@xmath4o@xmath0 ( iii - iii ) or a@xmath5b@xmath6o@xmath0 ( i - v ) structures have charged planes , composed of + 1 ao and -1 bo@xmath3 layers or -1 ao and + 1 bo@xmath3 layers , respectively . by stacking two perovskite layers from different charge families along the [ 001 ] direction , one obtains a _ polar discontinuity _ at the interface .",
    "such polar discontinuities have been reported to lead to nontrivial local structural and electronic ground states@xcite , which are often not present in the parent bulk compounds @xcite@xmath7@xcite .",
    "investigating the properties of these `` exotic '' local phases has been an increasingly active area of research in the past few years , particularly following a 2004 report@xcite of a conducting quasi - two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) at the interface between two wide - band insulators , laalo@xmath0 ( lao ) and srtio@xmath0 ( sto ) .",
    "the measured mobility and carrier density of the lao / sto interface are an order of magnitude larger than those in analogous semiconductor - based systems@xcite .",
    "furthermore , magnetism , @xcite superconductivity @xcite and a rich electronic phase diagram @xcite have also been reported for this same system .",
    "these fascinating and unexpected effects have generated strong excitement , and an intense effort is currently devoted to better understanding the fundamental mechanisms of charge compensation at polar oxide - oxide interfaces .",
    "parallel to this thrust , from the materials - design point of view , it is also important to identify new compounds , artificial superlattices or interfaces that might display similar ( or possibly even more striking ) behavior .",
    "a system can respond in several different ways to avoid a so - called _",
    "polar catastrophe_@xcite  a divergence in the potential caused by the polar discontinuity  at such an interface between two charge - mismatched perovskites .",
    "compensation by free carriers was proposed in ref .  , and is consistent with the observed conductivity at the interfaces .",
    "other likely possibilities are direct ionic charge compensation through mixed valency of the b cation , ion intermixing or oxygen vacancies at the interface@xcite , or polar distortions at the interface .",
    "these can be `` induced '' by the polar discontinuity if both materials are paraelectric ( pe ) in their bulk phase @xcite , or `` natural '' if one or both components in the superlattice is ferroelectric ( fe)@xcite . the mechanisms underlying induced and natural polar distortions can be readily understood in terms of classical electrostatics and the modern theory of polarization@xcite , whenever the relevant layers in the superlattice are at least three or four unit cells thick . in particular , the charge mismatch can be interpreted as a polarization discontinuity , which produces macroscopic electric fields in one or both components , because the normal component of the electric displacement field , @xmath8 , is preserved at a coherent insulating interface . for smaller thicknesses ,",
    "macroscopic concepts lose their meaning , as each film is too thin to identify a well - defined local value of the electric field or the polarization .",
    "thus , it remains an important question whether the above concepts are still valid when the layers in a superlattice are made thinner and thinner , down to the ultra - thin extreme limit of a single unit cell , or whether new phenomena arise that radically alter the physics .",
    "it is the main scope of this work to answer this question by studying some computer designed examples of 1 - 1 superlattices , constructed out of ferroelectric and paraelectric layers , with different composition and choices of polar / non - polar combinations .",
    "we stress that this question has some points of contact with , but is largely unrelated to the better - known problem of the critical thickness for ferroelectricity@xcite since the present problem deals with non - switchable polar distortions driven by a polar discontinuity rather than switchable ferroelectric behavior .",
    "in addition to issues related to the presence or absence of a polar discontinuity , other factors can influence or complicate the properties of the 1 - 1 bicomponent superlattices .",
    "in particular , structural instabilities such as the rotation and tilting of oxygen octahedra , the presence of misfit strain , and the presence of @xmath9 ions  associated with a tendency to ferroelectricity  in otherwise paraelectric layers , are likely to strongly affect the behavior .",
    "it is therefore of interest to study how these additional factors may alter the properties of the short - period superlattices compared to those expected solely out of consideration of the presence or absence of a polar discontinuity .    to separate the role of electrostatics from the role of the specific choice of cations within a given charge family",
    ", we investigate bicomponent superlattices with alternating iii - iii / ii - iv and i - v / ii - iv perovskite layers ( with interfacial polar discontinuities ) , as well as others with alternating ii - iv / ii - iv and i - v / i - v perovskite layers ( without polar discontinuities ) , both for a variety of chemical constituents .",
    "we find that our 1 - 1 structures behave in a way which is qualitatively analogous to the longer - period superlattices previously investigated in the literature .",
    "in particular , the systems containing polar discontinuities have strongly broken inversion symmetry and large polarizations , but are not switchable .",
    "the magnitudes of the polar distortions are as large as those in the corresponding bulk fe materials .",
    "the superlattices formed out of pe and fe layers with no potential discontinuity at the interface , on the other hand , usually have their off - centric displacements suppressed .",
    "we do , however , find examples of superlattices without polar mismatch that show marked ferroelectric instability , driven by either suppression of rotational instability or due to the presence of @xmath10 ions in the pe layer .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii includes the methodology and the details of the computations carried out in this study . in section",
    "iii we present our results and discussion in several sub - sections dealing respectively with the bulk properties of the constituent materials , the calculated structural properties of the superlattices ( with and without polar discontinuities ) , and the calculated functional properties including static dielectric constants .",
    "section iv provides the summary .",
    "our calculations are performed using the plane wave based pseudopotential framework of density functional theory ( dft)@xcite as implemented in the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp)@xcite .",
    "we choose the local density approximation ( lda ) rather than generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) to describe the exchange - correlation functional due to the later s systematic overestimation of polar behavior@xcite .",
    "the optimized geometries are obtained by full relaxation of the atomic positions and out - of - plane lattice constants ( @xmath11 ) , with the in - plane lattice constants ( @xmath12 ) fixed to the lda bulk lattice constant of the ferroelectric component in the tetragonal phase .",
    "the positions of the ions are relaxed toward equilibrium until the hellmann - feynman forces become less than 0.001 ev /  .",
    "a 4@xmath134@xmath134 monkhorst - pack k - point mesh@xcite and 450 ev plane - wave cut - off give good convergence of the computed ground state properties .",
    "the born effective charges , phonon frequencies and dielectric tensors are obtained from linear response calculations@xcite , using a variational formalism @xcite of the density functional perturbation theory , as implemented in the abinit code .",
    "we calculate the electronic contribution to the polarization as a berry phase using the method developed by king - smith and vanderbilt @xcite , and extract the ionic contribution by summing the product of the position of each ion with its pseudo - charge .",
    "the first part of our study concerns superlattices formed by alternating fe and pe single simple perovskite unit cells in the @xmath14 direction , and constraining them to be tetragonal in the @xmath15 plane . in a second stage",
    ", we consider structures formed by alternating 2@xmath132@xmath132 pe and fe cubic perovskite unit cells to allow rotation and tilting of the bo@xmath16 octahedra .",

    "we have carried out a detailed computational study of superlattices formed out of alternating layers of one unit cell thick fe and pe components , considering several different abo@xmath17 perovskites .",
    "we find that the tendency of the superlattices to exhibit polar properties depends strongly on the chemistry of the pe and fe components .",
    "in addition to interfacial polar discontinuities at the interfaces between the pe and fe layers , the epitaxial strain , rotational instability of the pe layer and the presence of @xmath10 second order jahn - teller active ions in the pe layer contribute to determining the polar behavior . while the polarization arising from a polar discontinuity",
    "is generally not switchable , other routes to polar behavior discussed here , do allow polarization switching .",
    "the strongest polar response was found for superlattices with polar discontinuities and formed out of fe and @xmath10 pe layers .",
