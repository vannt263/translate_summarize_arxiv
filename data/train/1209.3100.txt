    "over the past decade our understanding of stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) driven by gaussian processes has evolved considerably . as a natural counterpart to this development",
    ", there is now much interest in investigating the probabilistic properties of solutions to these equations .",
    "consider an sde of the form@xmath7 driven by an @xmath8-valued continuous gaussian process @xmath9 along @xmath10-vector fields @xmath11 and @xmath2 on @xmath12 .",
    "once the existence and uniqueness of @xmath13 has been settled , it is natural to ask about the existence of a smooth density of @xmath3 for @xmath14 . in the context of diffusion processes ,",
    "the theory is classical and goes back to hrmander @xcite for an analytical approach , and malliavin @xcite for a probabilistic one .    for the case where @xmath9 is fractional brownian motion",
    ", this question was first addressed by nualart and hu @xcite , where the authors show the existence and smoothness of the density when the vector fields are elliptic , and the driving gaussian noise is fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) for @xmath15 .",
    "further progress was achieved in @xcite where , again for the regime @xmath15 , the density was shown to be smooth under hrmander s celebrated bracket condition .",
    "rougher noises are not directly amenable to the analysis put forward in these two papers .",
    "additional ingredients have since gradually become available with the development of a broader theory of ( gaussian ) rough paths ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the papers @xcite and @xcite used this technology to establish the existence of a density under fairly general assumptions on the gaussian driving noises . these papers however fall short of proving the smoothness of the density , because the proof demands far more quantitative estimates than were available at the time .",
    "more recently , decisive progress was made on two aspects which obstructed the extension of this earlier work .",
    "first , the paper @xcite established sharp tail estimates on the jacobian of the flow @xmath16 driven by a wide class of ( rough ) gaussian processes .",
    "the tail turns out to decay quickly enough to allow to conclude the finiteness of all moments for @xmath16 .",
    "second , @xcite obtained a general , deterministic version of the key norris lemma ( see also @xcite for some recent work in the context of fractional brownian motion ) .",
    "the lemma of norris first appeared in  @xcite and has been interpreted as a quantitative version of the doob - meyer decomposition .",
    "roughly speaking , it ensures that there can not be too many cancellations between martingale and bounded variation parts of the decomposition .",
    "the work @xcite however shows that the same phenomenon arises in a purely deterministic setting , provided that the one - dimensional projections of the driving process are sufficiently and uniformly rough .",
    "this intuition is made precise through the notion of the `` modulus of hlder roughness '' .",
    "together with an analysis of the higher order malliavin derivatives of the flow of ( [ int - eq ] ) , also carried out in @xcite , these two results yield a hrmander - type theorem for fractional brownian motion if @xmath17 .    in this paper",
    "we aim to realise the broader potential of these developments by generalising the analysis to a wide class of gaussian processes .",
    "this class includes fractional brownian motion with hurst parameter @xmath18 $ ] , the ornstein - uhlenbeck process , and the brownian bridge .",
    "instead of focusing on particular examples of processes , our approach aims to develop a general set of conditions on @xmath9 under which malliavin - hrmander theory still works .",
    "the probabilistic proof of hrmander s theorem is intricate , and hard to summarise in a few lines , see @xcite for a relatively short exposition . however , let us highlight some basic features of the method in order to see where our main contributions lie :    1 .   at the centre of",
    "the proof of hrmander s theorem is a quantitative estimate on the non - degeneracy of the malliavin covariance matrix @xmath19 .",
    "our effort in this direction consists in a direct and instructive approach , which reveals an additional structure of the problem .",
    "in particular , the conditional variance of the process plays an important role , which does not appear to have been noticed so far . more specifically , following @xcite we study the malliavin covariance matrix as a 2d young integral against the covariance function @xmath20 .",
    "this provides the convenient representation:@xmath21   \\times\\left [   0,t \\right ]   } f_{s}\\left (   v;\\omega\\right )   f_{r}\\left (   v;\\omega\\right ) dr\\left (   s , r\\right )   , \\ ] ] for some @xmath22-hlder continuous @xmath23 , which avoids any detours via the fractional calculus that are specific to fbm .",
    "compared to the setting of @xcite we have to impose some additional assumptions on @xmath20 , but our more quantitative approach allows us in return to relax the zero - one law condition required in this paper .",
    "an essential step in the proof is achieved when one obtains some lower bounds on @xmath24 in terms of @xmath25}$ ] . towards this aim",
    "we prove a novel interpolation inequality , which lies at the heart of this paper .",
    "it is explicit and also sharp in the sense that it collapses to a well - known inequality for the space @xmath26 ) $ ] in the case of brownian motion .",
    "furthermore , this result should be important in other applications in the area , for example in establishing bounds on the density function ( see @xcite for a first step in this direction ) or studying small - time asymptotics .",
    "3 .   hrmander s theorem also relies on an accurate analysis and control of the higher order malliavin derivatives of the flow @xmath27 .",
    "this turns out the be notationally cumbersome , but structurally quite similar to the technology already developed for fbm . for this step",
    "we therefore rely as much as possible on the analysis performed in @xcite .",
    "the integrability results in @xcite then play the first of two important roles in showing that the flow belongs to the shigekawa - sobolev space @xmath28 .",
    "4 .   finally ,",
    "an induction argument that allows to transfer the bounds from the interpolation inequality to the higher order lie brackets of the vector fields has to be set up .",
    "this induction requires another integrability estimate for @xmath16 , plus a norris type lemma allowing to bound a generic integrand @xmath29 in terms of the resulting noisy integral @xmath30 in the rough path context .",
    "this is the content of our second main contribution , which can be seen as a generalisation of the norris lemma from @xcite to a much wider range of regularities and gaussian structures for the driving process @xmath9 .",
    "namely , we extend the result of @xcite from @xmath31-rough paths with @xmath32 to general @xmath31 under the same `` modulus of hlder roughness '' assumption . it is interesting to note that the argument still only requires information about the roughness of the path itself and not its lift .    let us further comment on the gaussian assumptions allowing the derivation of the interpolation inequality briefly described in step ( ii ) above .",
    "first , we need a standing assumption that regards the regularity of @xmath33 ( expressed in terms of its so called 2d @xmath34-variation , see @xcite ) and complementary young regularity of @xmath9 and its cameron - martin space .",
    "this is a standard assumption in the theory of gaussian rough paths .",
    "the first part of the condition guarantees the existence of a natural lift of the process to a rough path .",
    "the complementary young regularity in turn is necessary to perform malliavin calculus , and allows us to obtain the integrability estimates for @xmath16 in @xcite .    in order to understand the assumptions",
    "on which our central interpolation inequality hinges , let us mention that it emerges from the need to prove lower bounds of the type : @xmath35   \\times\\left [   0,t\\right ]   } f_{s}f_{t } \\ ,",
    "dr\\left ( s , t\\right )   \\geq c\\left\\vert f\\right\\vert _ { \\gamma;\\left [   0,t\\right ]   } ^{a}\\left\\vert f\\right\\vert _ { \\infty;\\left [   0,t\\right ]   } ^{2-a } , \\label{opt}\\ ] ] for some exponents @xmath22 and @xmath36 , and all @xmath22-hlder continuous functions @xmath37 .",
    "after viewing the integral in ( [ opt ] ) along a sequence of discrete - time approximations to the integral , relation relies on solving a sequence of finite dimensional partially constrained quadratic programming ( qp ) problems .",
    "these ( qp ) problem involve some matrices @xmath38 whose generic element can be written as @xmath39 $ ] , where @xmath40 designates the increment @xmath41 of the first component of @xmath9 .",
    "interestingly enough , some positivity properties of schur complements computed within the matrix @xmath38 play a prominent role in the resolution of the aforementioned ( qp ) problems . in order to guarantee these positivity properties ,",
    "we shall make two non - degeneracy type assumptions on the conditional variance and covariance structure of our underlying process @xmath42 ( see conditions [ non - determ ] and [ cond dom ] below ) .",
    "this is obviously quite natural , since schur complements are classically related to conditional variances in elementary gaussian analysis .",
    "we also believe that our conditions essentially characterise the class of processes for which we can quantify the non - degeneracy of @xmath43 in terms of the conditional variance of the process @xmath9 .    the outline of the article is as follows . in section  [ rough paths ] , we give a short overview of the elements of the theory of rough paths required for our analysis .",
    "section  [ main thm ] then states our main result . in section  [ examples section ] , we demonstrate how to verify the non - degeneracy assumptions required on the driving process in a number of concrete examples .",
    "the remainder of the article is devoted to the proofs .",
    "first , in section  [ norris lemma section ] , we state and prove our general version of norris s lemma and we apply it to the class of gaussian processes we have in mind . in section",
    "[ interpol ] , we then provide the proof of an interpolation inequality of the type ( [ opt ] ) .",
    "in section  [ differentiability section ] we obtain bounds on the derivatives of the solution with respect to its initial condition , as well as on its malliavin derivative . finally , we combine all of these ingredients in section  [ section proof main theorem ] in order to prove our main theorem .",
    "in this section we introduce some basic notation concerning rough paths , following the exposition in @xcite .",
    "in particular , we recall the conditions needed to ensure that a given gaussian process has a natural rough path lift .    for @xmath44 , recall that the truncated algebra @xmath45 is defined by @xmath46 , with the convention @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath45 is equipped with a straightforward vector space structure , plus an operation @xmath48 defined by @xmath49 where @xmath50 designates the projection on the @xmath51th tensor level .",
    "then @xmath52 is an associative algebra with unit element @xmath53 .    at its most fundamental",

    "let us also add the following two remarks :    1 .",
    "a rough path ( see definition  [ def : rp ] below ) , as well as the signature of any smooth function , takes values in the strict subset @xmath78 given by the `` group - like elements '' @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the linear span of all elements that can be written as a commutator of the type @xmath81 for two elements in @xmath45 .",
    "it is sometimes convenient to think of the indices @xmath82 in as words based on the alphabet @xmath83 .",
    "we shall then write @xmath84 for the iterated integral @xmath85 .    more generally , if @xmath86 we can consider the set of such group - valued paths @xmath87 note that the group structure provides a natural notion of increment , namely @xmath88 , and we can describe the set of `` norms '' on @xmath89 which are homogeneous with respect to the natural scaling operation on the tensor algebra ( see @xcite for definitions and details ) .",
    "one such example is the carnot - caratheodory ( cc ) norm ( see @xcite ) , which we denote by @xmath90 the precise one used is mostly irrelevant in finite dimensions because they are all equivalent .",
    "the subset of these so - called homogeneous norms which are symmetric and sub - additive ( again , see @xcite ) gives rise to genuine metrics on @xmath89 , for example @xmath91 in the case of the cc norm . in turn",
    "these metrics give rise to a notion of homogenous @xmath31-variation metrics @xmath92 on the @xmath89-valued paths .",
    "fixing attention to the cc norm , we will use the following homogenous @xmath31-variation and @xmath22-hlder variation semi - norms :    _ p ; & = _ i=1,  ,p ( _ d= ( t_j ) _ j : t_jd _ t_j , t_j+1 _ cc^p ) ^1/p , [ homogeneous norm ] + _ & = _ ( u , v)_st^2 .",
