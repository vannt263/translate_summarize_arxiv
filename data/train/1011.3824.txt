    "certainly it is not an immediate process and",
    "one can imagine that individual space - time structures emerge from the planck era gradually .",
    "one can expect that the simplest structures such as a set structure or a topology on this set can emerge first .",
    "the appearance of the manifold structure is the key event of the process .",
    "then the equivalence principle , in its non metric form , appears and makes possible a creation of  higher  structures such as , for example , the lorentzian structure .",
    "from this perspective it is interesting to ask how the space - time geometry is  nested  in theories more general than the differential geometry since the emerging process of gravitation has to be associated with a theory which is more general than the geometry of space - time manifold .    in this paper",
    "the sikorski s differential spaces theory ( see appendix a ) is applied to the discussion of the breaking down process of the equivalence principle . within this theory",
    "the non - metric version of the equivalence principle is one of the axioms of the space - time differential manifold ( d - manifold ) definition .",
    "let us consider points at which this axiom is not satisfied .",
    "the set of this points forms the so - called differentially singular boundary ( d - boundary ) .",
    "this issue is discussed in section 2 .",
    "the construction of this type of boundary is also described .    in section 3 ,",
    "the construction from section 2 is used for building the differential space ( d - space ) with d - boundary for the flat frw model .",
    "the issue of the prolongation of cosmic time and time - orientability to the d - boundary for this model is discussed in section 4 . in section 5",
    ", we describe the concept of the smooth evolution of this model starting from the initial singularity .",
    "we find the simplest smoothly evolved flat frw models in section 6 .",
    "some of them ( see section [ dark ] ) have the kinematical properties which are qualitatively agreeing with the recent cosmological observations @xcite .",
    "namely , these models begin their evolution with the decelerate expansion which changes into the accelerated one .",
    "the discussion of properties of the cosmological fluid which causes that type of smooth evolution for the simplest cosmological models is carried out in section 7 .",

    "it is assumed that these diffeomorphisms are smooth .",
    "it is worth to notice , that the non - metric version of the equivalence principle is encoded into two levels of the classical d - manifold definition , namely in the assumption of the existence of local homeomorphisms to @xmath1 and in the axioms of atlases .",
