    "dielectric spectroscopy has provided many informations to the investigation of complex materials , and especially to the field of glass transition phenomenon ( glass - forming systems ) during the last decades .",
    "this technique gives direct access to the polarization of molecular dipoles allowing the study of relaxation processes .",
    "it can probe the molecular structure and dynamics of several materials like liquids , polymer composites , colloids , porous materials , or ferroelectric crystals @xcite .",
    "it covers a wide range of frequency , typically from @xmath0 to @xmath2 hz , going up to @xmath3 hz with coaxial techniques @xcite .",
    "dielectric liquids of small molecules like the glass - forming glycerol @xcite or glass - forming polymers @xcite have been extensively studied .",
    "dielectric spectroscopy gives direct access to relaxation times@xcite like rheology , but it is a rotational relaxation one , not a translational .",
    "nevertheless , it has been showed that on molecular liquids at equilibrium , these two relaxation times have the same temperature dependence@xcite , at least above the glass transition .",
    "recent progress in the glass transition were provided by direct measurement of a dynamical growing length scale@xcite .",
    "this technique has always been improved , e.g. , the important work done regarding the electrodes in order to measure charged liquids even at low frequency @xcite .",
    "dielectric spectroscopy has also been coupled to scattering techniques such as x - rays @xcite or neutrons @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent theories on aging and out of equilibrium physics predict interesting low frequency properties of the response and fluctuations , either during the relaxation of the system towards equilibrium after a quench of the control parameter @xcite , or when the system is driven by external fields @xcite . in order to test these models",
    "it is important to measure the response of the system as a function of time after the beginning of the time dependent phenomenon@xcite .",
    "single frequency measurements will force to repeat the experiment many times for each selected frequency making the experiment extremely long and difficult . in those cases multi - frequency measurements are absolutely necessary .",
    "the standard technique to perform multi - frequency response functions is to drive the system with a white noise signal .",
    "the main disadvantage of this approach is to require long averages before reaching reliable response measurements ( see section [ procedure ] ) .",
    "indeed , the lower frequencies need long time sampling . to overcome this problem we present an innovative setup that allows simultaneous impedance measurements at several frequencies over a typical range of @xmath4 hz with low noise and high sensibility .",
    "this has been obtained with a careful choice of the input signal , of the current amplifier , and an appropriate correction , which allow us to measure high capacitances with very small losses ( > @xmath5 is the typical order of magnitude ) .",
    "this means that our system is particularly useful for the study of relaxation processes in polymer films which have very high resistivity .",
    "the length of the measurement time window is imposed only by the smallest frequency that one needs to resolve because all other frequencies are measured simultaneously .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ bkg ]",
    "we give some general , basic background on the dielectric spectroscopy .",

    "dielectric spectroscopy investigates the frequency dependent dielectric properties of a material @xcite .",
    "it is based on the interaction of an external field with the electric dipole moment of the sample , often expressed by the complex dielectric permittivity or dielectric constant : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the dielectric displacement and @xmath8 the electric field , both dependent on the angular frequency @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 can be expressed as @xmath11 being @xmath12 the stored permittivity , which is related to the stored energy by the sample , and @xmath13 the loss permittivity , which indicates the loss energy .",
    "their loss tangent is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the phase shift between @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the dielectric constant @xmath16 depends on the dielectric material , the frequency , the temperature , age .",
    "the orientation polarization of dipoles due to applied disturbances allows the investigation of the dielectric relaxation of the material in the frequency range below @xmath17hz .",
    "moreover , if those dipoles are of molecular origin , the dielectric spectroscopy allows to investigate molecular motions .",
    "the experimental techniques and procedures for dielectric spectroscopy depend on the frequency range of interest . at low and intermediate frequencies ( @xmath18 hz )",
    "the sample can be modeled as a parallel plate capacitor where the sample is the dielectric insulator in between the two electrodes @xcite . assuming no edge capacitances",

    ".    the complex impedance @xmath23 can be measured by imposing the voltage @xmath29 and measuring the current @xmath30 flowing through : @xmath31 as @xmath32 is low on pure dielectric systems this means that the resistive part of the impedance is quite high and the in - phase current becomes hardly detectable .",
    "so far we described the ideal capacitor , but in the real experiments there are other parameters to take into account .",
    "on the one hand , corrections due to the measurement system like the influence of the extra capacitance in the cables . on the other hand , sample preparation must be very careful to avoid difficulties , such as sample geometry , bad electric contacts between electrodes and sample , edge capacitances , or electrode polarization .",
    "sample geometry has to be well known .",
    "we do not discuss these standard experimental details but we focus on the description of the features of the electronics , the driving signal , and the data analysis that we use in our experimental setup .    our goal is to measure @xmath10 simultaneously in a frequency range covering 4 orders of magnitude in @xmath9 . as dielectric losses are in general small in pure dielectric ( such as polymers ) , any spurious effect must be taken into account in order to have a good accuracy on the wide frequency range . to define notation and to clarify the principle of our technique",

    "in order to measure @xmath33 we use a current amplifier whose entrance impedance is just the sample impedance @xmath23 as sketched in fig .",

    "thus , we suppose that the bias currents at both entrances are zero ( @xmath34 ) , and that the open - loop amplification of u is infinite for all frequencies .",
    "this implies that @xmath35 because the positive entrance is at the ground potential .",
    "therefore , the impedance @xmath36 ( given by the parallel of the capacitances of the cables and of the amplifier entrance ) does not play any role in this case . from the standard circuit analysis ,",
    "the current balance between the current flowing in the feedback impedance @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) and the entrance current we obtain @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the reference and @xmath41 the output potentials ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - circuit ] ) .",
    "we have omitted the obvious dependence on @xmath9 .",
    "thus , the impedance @xmath42 can be calculated as @xmath43    nevertheless , considering a real amplifier , ( i.e. with a finite open loop gain ) one has to take into account in the current balance ( fig .",

    "<S> we present an innovative technique which allows the simultaneous measurement of the dielectric constant of a material at many frequencies , spanning a four orders of magnitude range chosen between @xmath0  hz and @xmath1  hz . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity and accuracy are comparable to those obtained using standard single frequency techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the technique is based on three new and simple features : a ) the precise real time correction of the amplification of a current amplifier ; b ) the specific shape of the excitation signal and its frequency spectrum ; and c ) the precise synchronization between the generation of the excitation signal and the acquisition of the dielectric response signal . </S>",
    "<S> this technique is useful in the case of relatively fast dynamical measurements when the knowledge of the time evolution of the dielectric constant is needed . </S>"
