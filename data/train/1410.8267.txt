    "segmented polyurethanes ( spu ) is a generic name for polyblock copolymers which are usually obtained by polyaddition reaction between long - chain di- or polyols , and diisocyanates @xcite . due to poor compatibility between polyol and diisocyanate chain fragments (",
    "commonly referred to as soft and stiff segments , respectively ) , the latter usually self - associate and segregate as nano - size domains from a continuous phase of the former .",
    "depending on the relative content and the intrinsic properties of soft and stiff nano - phases ( i.e. , molar weight , polarity , chain stiffness , etc . )",
    ", the mechanical performance of spu can be readily varied over an unusually broad range , from soft rubbers to hard thermoelastoplastics @xcite .",
    "the relatively easy synthesis of spu combined with their unique properties make them attractive for different practical applications ; however , their commercial value is severely limited by quite a few deficiencies , the intrinsically high flammability being among the most notorious @xcite . an apparently straightforward way to minimize these deficiencies by",
    ", e.g. , compounding of spu with mineral fillers , proved to be of little feasibility in so far as their other important properties significantly deteriorated .",
    "an attractive alternative route for synthesis of spu with improved performance can be based on sol - gel technology which ensures a homogeneous , in situ generation of inorganic @xcite nanoparticles throughout a continuous polymer matrix . using this route to generate a ceramic - type nanophase ( silicates , aluminates , phosphates , etc . ) , a series of spu - based nanocomposites ( spun ) with significantly improved weather- , radiation- and flame - resistance was developed . this paper is aimed at the further characterization of the same samples @xcite by mechanical relaxation technique .",
    "as described @xcite , the organic / inorganic hybrids ( segmented polyurethane - based nanocomposites , spun ) were prepared by reaction between the organic precursor [ macrodiisocyanate , mdic , from propylene oxide glycol oligomer ( @xmath0 ) and 2,4-toluene diisocyanate ] , and the inorganic precursor ( sodium silica - polyphosphate , ssp )    thin films of the spun for physical characterization were cast from solutions using methyl cellulose as a surfactant , and dried overnight in a vacuum oven at @xmath1 c to constant weight .",
    "the step - wise loading ( streching)/unloading ( contraction ) cycles were measured ( with the estimated mean errors below 2 % ) at room temperature with the mechanical relaxometer on basis of stretching calorimeter described in details @xcite .",
    "each specimen was stretched at a constant velocity @xmath2 ( 10% of the total specimen length per minute ) to a predetermined @xmath3 , stored at fixed @xmath3 to the full completion of mechanical relaxations , and thereafter allowed to contract at the same velocity @xmath4 to zero force . the typical difference between fixed extensions in two successive steps , @xmath5 , varied from several digits in the fourth place to a few digits in the third place .",
    "prior to each measurement , the previous mechanical history was erased by several successive pre - stretchings to the maximum extension @xmath6 , free relaxation to zero stress and subsequent storage in an unloaded state overnight .",
    "then the specimen was stretched to a predetermined fixed extension @xmath7 , and the time dependence of the stress @xmath8 was monitored at @xmath9 .",
    "there s a lot of possibilities to use relaxation method . usually for uncrosslinked polyurethanes",
    "the stress - realxation phenomena considered as a set of physical processes , such as are : breacking of weak chemical linkages ( urethane , allophanate , ets . ) , disrupting of hydrogen and other secondary bonding , decreasing the number of free entanglements and slippage of trapped entanglements  @xcite . also reported as a result of different experimental methods that main role in stress - relaxation in polyurethanes plays soft segments at the temperatures below 373 k and higher then @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "well known that hysteresys phenomena caused by high stress - orientation mechanism in hard domens ( hd ) of pu , at large strains hd even can be brocken , and high mobility of soft segments is a pledge of fast stress relaxation and shape recovery  @xcite .",
    "several popular models are used for explaining of relaxation datas .",
    "first was maxwell s models .",
    "there are different variations , but general is that solid body presented as a set of viscousious and elastic modes .",
    "amount of different modes depends on morphological models .",
    "fast and slow modes reffered to different morphological units ( e.g. microdomens  @xcite , entropic elasticity of back bone segments in the filler - reinforced matrix  @xcite , ets . )    one of the drawbacks of this models is limited set of relaxation modes and as a result is impossibility to include all relaxational spectra in mathematical description .",
    "recent times reptational theories based on the tube model of de gennes , edwards and doi .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite , that mechanism of relaxation in networks model of kolraush - watts - williams ( kww ) based on a simple termodinamical principles leads to a common fractional power law and consider this problem via introduction of stretched exponent which should reflect a common shape of relaxation spectra  @xcite .",
    "main equation should be written as : @xmath11 where @xmath12  coupling parameter , @xmath13  non - relaxing part of overall modulus , @xmath14  relaxing part , @xmath15  effective time . here",
    "@xmath12 represents microscopically the strength of coupling between a relaxing species and it s surroundings and macroscopically  the breadth of relaxation . the higher the coupling strength between primitive spiecies with it s envirement , the closer @xmath12 to unity .",
    "complications appears when nonlinear effects of stretching gon na be included into discussion . in this case",
    "the popular stohastic reptational models are hardly fits experimental datas well .",
    "main distinguishing nonlinear processes during large step - strain experiments assumed as : chain retractions , convective constraint releases ( ccr ) , partial strand extensions ( pse ) and nonaffine deformations  @xcite .",
    "modification of kww model concerning nonlinear effects gives a dependense of coupling factor @xmath12 from time as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a fictive temperature , which ascribes volume changing during relaxation as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the difference between liquid and glassy state termal expansion coefficients .",

    "[ pic3 ] that whole group of results can be devided onto two filler containt - dependent zones as it shown with straight lines .",
    "a visiable decrease of equlibrium stress with increasing of filler conteint in the whole range of elongations indicates on lowering of number of crosslinking points ( crosslinking density ) . comparing this with moduli dependense",
    "it could be pointed that decreasing of filler content could leads to lowering of crosslink dencity , but it does not mean lowering of moduli .",
