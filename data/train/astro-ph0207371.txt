    "since from a single vantage point we can only observe a bit less than half of the solar surface , helioseismic power spectra computed for a specific target mode with degree @xmath2 and azimuthal order @xmath3 also contains power from modes with different  and usually nearby  @xmath2 and @xmath3 values .",
    "the presence of these unwanted modes , or spatial leaks , complicates the fitting of the resulting observed spectra and degrade the mode parameter estimates , especially when the leaks have frequencies similar to that of the target mode . as mode lifetimes get shorter and spatial leaks get closer in frequency ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath4 becomes small ) , individual p - modes can no longer be resolved .",
    "this mode blending occurs around @xmath5 for p - modes with frequency near @xmath6 mhz and around @xmath7 for the f - modes .",
    "once individual modes blend into ridges , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : spectra ] , the power distribution of the ridge masks the true underlying mode frequency and the ridge central frequency is not a good estimate of the target mode frequency .",
    "moreover the amplitudes of the spatial leaks have been shown to be asymmetric ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "a direct consequence of this leakage asymmetry is to offset the power distribution of the ridges .",
    "such offset results in a significant difference between the central frequency of the ridge and the frequency of the targeted individual mode . to recover the underlying mode frequency from fitting the ridge , an accurate model of the amplitude of the peaks that contribute to the ridge power distribution ( _ i.e. _ , the leakage matrix ) is needed .",
    "the lack of unbiased determinations of mode frequencies and frequency splittings at high degrees has so far limited the use of such high - degree data in helioseismic inversions for constraining the near - surface structure and dynamics of the sun . since experiments like the michelson doppler imager ( mdi ) on board",
    "the solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) , with a two - arcsec - per - pixel spatial resolution in full - disk mode , allows us to detect oscillation modes up to @xmath8 @xcite , only a small fraction of the observed modes are currently used .",
    "high - degree modes are trapped near the solar surface : for example , the lower turning point of a mode of degree @xmath9 and frequency around 3 mhz is at 0.99 of the solar radius .",
    "this makes them exceptional diagnostic tools to probe the near - surface region of the sun , a region of great interest .",
    "indeed , it is there that the effects of the equation of state are felt most strongly , and that dynamical effects of convection and processes that excite and damp the solar oscillations are predominantly concentrated . @xcite",
    "have shown that the inclusion of high - degree modes ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath2 up to 1000 ) has the potential to improve dramatically the inference of the sound speed in the outermost 2 to 3% of the solar radius . furthermore , inversion of artificial mode frequency differences resulting from models computed with two different equations of state ( _ i.e. _ , mhd and opal ) recovered the intrinsic difference in @xmath10 , the adiabatic exponent , throughout the second helium ionization zone and well into the first helium and hydrogen ionization zones , with error bars far smaller than the differences resulting from using two different equations of state .",
    "these tests were carried out using the relatively large observational uncertainties resulting from ridge fitting , but with the implicit assumption that systematic errors were not present .",
    "these tests show that we can probe subtle effects in the thermodynamic properties of this region , but only when including such high - degree modes .",
    "the first estimates of high - degree mode frequencies used @xmath3-averaged big bear solar observatory data @xcite . to recover the underlying mode frequency from fitting a given ( @xmath11 ) ridge",
    ", they used a simple gaussian profile as an approximation for the @xmath3-averaged leakage matrix .",
    "namely : @xmath12 where @xmath13 while the @xmath14 term represents the leakage asymmetry introduced by an image scale error of a fraction @xmath15 of the image size .",
    "the ridge centroid frequency was estimated using a simple weighted average : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the individual mode power amplitude and @xmath18 is the mode frequency . the frequency difference between the ridge and the mode frequency , @xmath19 ,",
    "can thus be estimated using a parametric representation of the leakage coefficients .    for intermediate degree modes ( @xmath20 )",
    "this frequency difference can be directly measured by reducing the frequency resolution of the observed power spectra as to force individual modes to blend into ridges .",
    "using observed @xmath21 , the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath15 can be calibrated at these intermediate degrees and the correction extrapolated to high - degree modes .    as @xcite state in their paper",
    ", this is only a first step and there is substantial room for improvement particularly at high @xmath2 .",
    "following the same idea , but improving on the method , @xcite and @xcite estimated high - degree mode frequencies using mount wilson and mdi data respectively .",
    "in contrast , @xcite , using data from the high - l helioseismometer at kitt peak , calculated the @xmath3-averaged leakage matrix , but neglecting the horizontal components , in order to estimate high - degree mode frequencies .    in this paper",
    ", we present the results of an extensive study of the various elements that contribute to the precise value of the effective leakage matrix , that in turn is key to the precise determination of high degree modes .",
    "we have attempted to construct a physically motivated model  rather than an _ ad hoc _ correction scheme  in order to produce an unbiased determination of the high - degree modes .",
    "since @xcite has shown that the inclusion of the horizontal component of the leakage matrix calculation partially explains its observed asymmetry , we have included the horizontal component in all our leakage matrix calculations .    in section 2",
    ", we describe the data we used and how we computed and fitted the power spectra used in this work . in section 3 we present and discuss ridge modeling for high degree modes while in section 4 we address the issue of estimating the ratio between the radial and horizontal components . in section 5",
    "we discuss the instrumental effects specific to mdi that must be included to properly model the ridge power distribution .",
    "finally , in section 6 , we present the results of our analysis followed by our conclusions .",
    "the data used in this work consists of four separate time series of full - disk dopplergrams .",
    "these dopplergrams were obtained by the mdi instrument while operating in its full disk @xmath23 per pixel resolution mode and during the _ dynamics program_. the instrument is operated in this mode some 3 months every year , when the available telemetry bandwidth is large enough to bring down full - disk images .",
    "table  [ tab : observationperiods ] lists the starting time and duration of each of the four _ dynamics _ data time series .",
    "the spherical harmonics decomposition up to @xmath24 was carried out by the mdi science team @xcite .",
    "for the same periods , mode frequencies and rotational splitting coefficients of individual p - modes were computed for low and intermediate degrees as part of the _ structure program _",
    "@xcite .",
    "llc & 05/23 & 63 + 1997 & 04/14 & 93 + 1998 & 01/09 & 92 + 1999 & 03/13 & 77 +    for each _ dynamics program _",
    "period we computed and fitted power spectra using two distinct approaches .",
    "the purpose of the first one was to get some observational estimate of the leakage matrix asymmetry , using an optimum estimate of the sectoral limit spectra computed with a high frequency resolution where individual p - modes can be clearly resolved .",
    "we used only sectoral spectra because the leakage matrix for the sectoral modes is diagonal at a fixed radial order , @xmath25 ( namely non - zero only when @xmath26 ) , resulting in a simple leakage pattern , with modes separated by at least the quantity @xmath27 . for zonal and tesseral modes",
    "the leakage pattern is more complex resulting in leaks very close to each other , some separated only by even multiples of @xmath28 . for these modes , only for very low frequencies ( where the lifetime is long enough ) , and",
    "if the time series is long enough , can the main peak be resolved from its closest spatial leaks .",
    "the second approach is aimed at computing optimum power spectra for high - degree modes ridge fitting .",
    "namely spectra with a lower frequency resolution  since individual modes are not resolved  while in the process averaging out the realization noise that a high frequency resolution spectrum would reveal .",
    "moreover , at low and intermediate degrees individual modes blend into ridges as a result of the low frequency resolution .",
    "this approach creates an overlap between mode fitting and ridge fitting where the frequency offset introduced by ridge fitting can be directly measured . by using this overlap , we can check the model we have developed to infer mode parameters from the fitted ridge parameters .",
    "estimates of limit spectra were computed for intermediate degree sectoral modes , when individual modes could be resolved , using the following procedure .",
    "first , each time series of spherical harmonic coefficients was detrended using a 21-minute - long running mean . then",
    ", the 9th order sine multi - tapered power spectrum was computed , using the two- to three - month - long time series and thus corresponding to a frequency resolution between 0.18  and 0.24 .",
    "finally , for a range of degrees ( 15 consecutive @xmath2 ) at a fixed order , @xmath25 , small fractions of power spectra ( about 300 @xmath29hz ) , centered around each mode frequency , were averaged .",
    "the sectoral mode frequencies were computed using a table of frequencies and frequency splittings resulting from mode fitting of mdi data .",
    "a seven - component profile was fitted in the least - squares sense to these limit spectra using the following parameterization : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the individual mode amplitude and frequency respectively ; @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the mode width and asymmetry parameter respectively  assumed constant for all seven components ; and @xmath36 and @xmath37 represent the background power .",
    "note that the shape of the profiles used in this formulation is equivalent to the one defined by equation  4 of @xcite .",
    "after some rudimentary algebra , one can identify their asymmetry coefficient , @xmath38 , to the one we use , @xmath39 , namely @xmath40 .      for each period listed in table  [ tab : observationperiods ] ,",
    "the time series of spherical harmonic coefficients were sub - divided in 4096-minute - long intervals . for each spherical harmonic degree , @xmath2 , and each azimuthal order , @xmath3 , each interval was first detrended using a 17-minute - long running mean , and then fourier transformed with an oversampling of 2 to estimate the power spectrum .",
    "the power spectra corresponding to each 4096-minute - long interval in a given period were then averaged together to produce high signal - to - noise ratio spectra with a frequency resolution of 4.1 . as a result of this low frequency resolution , the individual modes down to @xmath41 blended into ridges , while the ridge width itself is still very much oversampled .",
    "the following asymmetric profile plus a background term was fitted in the least squares sense to each low frequency resolution spectrum , for @xmath42 : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 such parameterization of the background power is better suited for the fit performed here , namely over a broad frequency range .    in this case ,",
    "@xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the _ ridge _ amplitude , width , frequency and asymmetry parameters for a given ( @xmath50 ) ridge fitting . for practical reasons ,",
    "this fitting was carried out only every 5th @xmath2 for @xmath51 and every 10th @xmath2 for @xmath52 , and only for some 50 equally spaced @xmath3 values at each @xmath2 . from the resulting _ ridge _ frequencies , the _ ridge _ frequency splittings were parameterized in terms of clebsh - gordon coefficients ( @xmath53 , for @xmath54 , see * ? ? ?",
    "a single asymmetric function was used to to fit each ridge power density profile ( eq .  [ eq : asymprof ] ) . since the ridge power density profile results from the overlap of the target mode and the spatial leaks , it is mathematically not a similar single asymmetric function . in the specific case of high degree modes and at the frequency resolution we have used we believe that our approach is both justified and practical , based on the following considerations .",
    "first , the profile resulting from the overlap of nearby profiles is reasonably well modeled by a single profile when the ratio of the width of the individual profiles ( @xmath55 ) to the separation ( @xmath56 ) become large .",
    "indeed , for a ratio of 2  a ratio that roughly corresponds to the mean ratio around @xmath57  the root - mean - squares ( rms ) of the difference between a superposition of profiles and a single profile is only 4% ( when normalizing the resulting fitted profile maximum to unity ) . for a ratio of 4 ( @xmath58 ) the rms of this difference drop to 2% , while for a ratio of 10 ( @xmath59 ) this rms drop to 0.6% .",
    "these numbers are to be compared to the rms of the residuals to the fit that are around 5 to 7% ( when using the same normalization ) at all degrees and are dominated by the realization noise .",
    "the second reason to use a single profile is practical : fitting to the resulting power density profile the sum of individual overlapping profiles is underconstrained , unless some assumptions on the separations and/or the relative amplitudes are made . since neither of these quantities",
    "are known _ a priory _ with enough precision such approach is impractical .",
    "we describe here our physically motived ridge model , from which corrections to the ridge parameters are estimated .",
    "once the offsets between ridge and mode parameters are determined , the observed ridge parameters can be corrected and the mode parameters for high-@xmath2 obtained , making it possible to study the near - surface region of the sun .      since the spatial dependence of solar oscillations can be described in terms of spherical harmonics @xmath60 of co - latitude @xmath61 and longitude @xmath62 , the velocity signal resulting from these oscillations can be written as : @xmath63 and the leakage matrix components , resulting from the spherical harmonic decomposition of the observed line - of - sight velocity , are given by : @xmath64 where @xmath65 represents the complex conjugate operator and @xmath66 is the spatial window function of the observations  _",
    "i.e. _ , a function that delimits the angular span of the observations and that includes additional spatial attenuations like spatial apodization .",
    "the complete leakage matrix is the sum of the radial component @xmath67 and the horizontal components @xmath68 .",
    "thus a mode with a given ( @xmath69 ) will leak in the ( @xmath70 ) power spectrum with an amplitude attenuated by a factor @xmath71 where : @xmath72 and where @xmath73 is the horizontal - to - vertical displacement ratio .",
    "using a simple outer boundary condition , _ i.e. _  that the lagrangian pressure perturbation vanish ( @xmath74 ) , the small amplitude oscillations equations for the adiabatic and non - magnetic case lead to an estimate of the ratio @xmath75 , given by @xcite : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the gravitational constant , @xmath78 is the solar mass , @xmath79 is the solar radius , @xmath80 is the cyclic frequency ( @xmath81 ) and @xmath82 .",
    "it can be reduced to the square of the ratio of the frequency of the fundamental ( @xmath83 ) for the given degree to the mode frequency , since the frequency of the fundamental is given by @xcite @xmath84 since for a given @xmath2 , the f - mode frequency is smaller than any p - mode frequency , equation  [ eq : beta ] implies that @xmath85 .",
    "estimates of @xmath75 resulting from computing the adiabatic and non - magnetic eigenfunctions using a standard solar model @xcite at the appropriate atmospheric height for the mdi instrument and using a different upper boundary condition than the one leading to equation  [ eq : beta ] gives a very similar result .",
    "these calculations produce values that , above 2 mhz , decrease with frequency slightly faster than predicted by equation  [ eq : beta ] ( _ i.e. _ , 15@xmath86 smaller at 3 mhz ) .",
    "however , the non - adiabatic nature of the oscillations in the solar atmosphere are not taken into account in these calculations nor is it taken into account in the derivation of equation  [ eq : beta ] . since the solar interior is non - adiabatic near the surface and since the effect of the magnetic field , if any , is likely to be mostly near the surface , the _ real _ value of @xmath75 might be somewhat different .",
    "the estimate of the coefficients of the leakage matrix given by equations  [ eq : theoleakr ] to [ eq : theoleakp ] is a useful guide but remains oversimplified .",
    "indeed , these equations do not take into account the pixel size of the detector or the instrumental modulation transfer function ( mtf ) , effects that are substantial at high degrees .",
    "therefore , rather than integrating these equations , we opted to compute the leakage matrix coefficients by constructing simulated images corresponding to the line - of - sight contribution of each component of a single spherical harmonic mode and decompose that image into spherical harmonic coefficients using the numerical decomposition used to process the observations .",
    "such an approach allows us to easily include effects like the finite pixel size of the detector as well as other instrumental effects like the instrumental mtf , a plate scale error or some image distortion .",
    "since this calculation is computationally expensive and since the leakage coefficients vary smoothly with @xmath2 and @xmath3 , it was carried out only for a subset of modes , from which all the required values were interpolated .",
    "figure  [ fig : obspowbeta ] shows some typical examples of observed and synthetic spectra where the amplitude of the leaks corresponds to leakage matrices calculated with and without including the horizontal component ( right and left panels respectively ) .",
    "this figure clearly shows not only that the observed amplitudes of the spatial leaks are asymmetric , but the importance of the contribution of the horizontal component in the leakage matrix calculation , since the radial component of the leakage matrix is nearly symmetric .",
    "it should also be noticed that , although the complete leakage matrix agrees in broad terms with the observed spectra , it does not agree in detail , as already pointed out by @xcite .",
    "this was the motivation for the work we present here , where we discuss in details how to best compute the correct _ effective _ leakage matrix , _ i.e. _  the one resulting from the _ actual _ data analysis .",
    "@xcite has computed the distortion of the eigenfunctions by a slow , axisymmetric differential rotation .",
    "he showed that the distorted eigenfunctions can be expressed as a superposition of the undistorted ones . under the assumption of axial symmetry",
    ", each of the superposed functions has the same azimuthal order @xmath3 , while symmetry with respect to the solar equatorial plane implies that the values of the spherical harmonic degree included in the superposition be either all odd or even .",
    "the coriolis acceleration is also assumed to be small which is valid for high - degree p - modes ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "this additional simplification reduces the perturbed eigenfunctions to be approximately a superposition of unperturbed eigenfunctions of the same radial order @xmath25 .",
    "also , the rotation rate @xmath88 for high degree modes ( @xmath87 corresponds roughly to the radius range @xmath89 ) is primarily a function of latitude , and can be parameterized as : @xmath90 where @xmath91 nhz , @xmath92 nhz and @xmath93 nhz @xcite , and @xmath61 represents the co - latitude .",
    "the perturbed leakage matrix can be expanded in terms of the unperturbed one as : @xmath94 where : @xmath95 \\",
    ", d\\theta \\label{eq : gll}\\ ] ] @xmath96 \\label{eq : delphi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and where @xmath97 is zero unless @xmath98 is even , @xmath99 , @xmath100 .",
    "this distortion is illustrated in figures  [ fig : gll ] and [ fig : woodard ] , where we show the variation of @xmath97 with respect to @xmath3 and @xmath101 for selected values of @xmath2 , and a synthetic spectrum with and without distortion by differential rotation for @xmath102 .",
    "we should also add that @xcite has shown that including meridional circulation affects these calculations at the 10% level .",
    "synthetic power spectra were computed by overlapping individual modes as they leak in the simulated spectrum according to : @xmath103 where @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the mode frequency , width and asymmetry parameter used to generate the model .",
    "we used for ( @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 ) values based on observed parameters and used equation  [ eq : beta ] for the values of @xmath75 .",
    "we generated these synthetic spectra for values of @xmath2 between 100 and 900  but only every 5th @xmath2 up to 250 and every 10th @xmath2 above 250 , replicating the sampling we used in the fitting of the observed mdi spectra as described in section [ sec : ridgefitting ] .",
    "we generated two sets of synthetic power spectra , one where we did not include the effect of the distortion of the eigenfunction due the differential rotation ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath107 ) , while the other did include this effect .",
    "we then used on these two sets of simulated ridges the same fitting procedure we used on the actual observations , as described in section  [ sec : ridgefitting ] and equation  [ eq : asymprof ] , to compute _ ridge _ frequencies and frequency splitting coefficients .",
    "if our model is correct and complete , our simulations should produce frequency and splitting coefficient offsets smilar to the one resulting from mdi observations .",
    "figure  [ fig : overlap ] illustrates , in an @xmath2@xmath108 diagram format , the region of overlap between mode fitting and ridge fitting .",
    "this range of frequencies and degrees is useful to valide our methodology but too restrictive to dare to carry out any extrapolation . in figures  [ fig : del96a ] to [ fig : del96bl ] we show frequency and splitting coefficient offsets from our two sets of simulations and the offsets from actual observations for intermediate - degree modes where there is an overlap between ridge and mode fitting .",
    "the theoretical differences agree overall with the observations ( _ i.e. _ , magnitude and general trend ) , but not in detail .",
    "the effect of the distortion by the differential rotation is significant , and affects the most the odd splitting coefficients .",
    "it explains very well the discontinuity in the splittings coefficients seen as far back as in @xcite , and more recently in @xcite .",
    "the latitudinal dependence of the solar rotation rate , @xmath109 , must in principle be known to compute the perturbation of the leakage matrix by the differential rotation ( see section  [ sec : pertrot ] ) .",
    "equations  [ eq : gll ] and [ eq : delphi ] result from an explicit parameterization of the near surface rotation with latitude given by equation  [ eq : omega ] , and thus depend on the precise values adopted for @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "therefore the correction for the ridge rotational splittings depends on a model of rotation , while the corrected splittings are meant to allow us to derive that rotation profile .    in order to estimate the effect of the rotation profile on the correction of the splittings",
    ", we have synthesized theoretical ridges using three different rotation profiles .",
    "each set of ridges was then fitted and ridge frequency splittings were computed , from which three sets of splitting coefficient corrections were computed .    the first model , hereafter model a , used a somewhat arbitrary rotation profile defined by @xmath112 and @xmath113 nhz , model b used a profile inferred by @xcite using the mdi medium-@xmath2 splitting coefficients , while model c used the profile given by @xcite based on the cross - correlation of mt .",
    "wilson magnetograms .",
    "the three profiles are compared in figure  [ fig : omega ] .",
    "relative variations with respect to model a are show in table  [ tab : omegasplit ] and illustrated in figure  [ fig : deltheo_omega ] .",
    "the first column of table  [ tab : omegasplit ] indicates the average relative change in the rotation profile , while the other columns show the average and rms of the respective parameter relative corrections .",
    "although the parameters resulting from the different methods used to characterize the image distortion of mdi do not agree as well expected , the distortion pattern resulting from a tilt of the detector is a rather good model of the observed distortion .",
    "the fact that the model parameters are so different when using different methods might be attributed to the complicated instrumental psf of the mdi optical package that is not fully known and therefore can not be taken into account . in particular the different observational methods described above use features of the image at different spatial scales ( or spatial wavenumbers ) to estimate the image distortion .",
    "the psf may also explain why the ellipticity of the images changes significantly when the images are strongly defocused .",
    "another possible explanation may , of course , be that other types of distortions , such as non square pixels , are present .",

    "<S> we also present a detailed discussion of the modeling of the ridge power distribution , and the contribution of the various observational and instrumental effects on the spatial leakage , in the context of the mdi instrument . </S>",
    "<S> we have constructed a physically motivated model ( rather than some _ ad hoc _ correction scheme ) resulting in a methodology that can produce an unbiased determination of high - degree modes , once the instrumental characteristics are well understood .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we present changes in high degree mode parameters with epoch and thus solar activity level and discuss their significance . </S>"
