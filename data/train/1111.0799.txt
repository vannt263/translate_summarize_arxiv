    "it is well known that to generate the density perturbation of the cmb of the magnitude observed by cobe and wmap , we need an inflationary period generated by the flat potential of a scalar field with coupling @xmath0 in a @xmath1 theory . for standard model higgs ,",
    "@xmath2 is approximately @xmath3 and the higgs can not be used as inflaton .",
    "a way out was proposed by bezrukov and shaposhnikov @xcite who coupled the standard model higgs with the ricci scalar with a large coupling constant @xmath4 .",
    "this large coupling leads to problem with unitarity @xcite of graviton - scalar scattering .",
    "some attempts to solve the unitarity problem associated with the large higgs curvature coupling are in @xcite    in this paper we follow a different approach for the generation of scale invariant density perturbations .",
    "it was shown by rubakov and collaborators @xcite that a conformally coupled field rolling down a quartic potential can generate scale invariant density perturbation .",
    "these perturbations can become superhorizon in an inflationary era or in a ekpyrotic scenario @xcite .",
    "we work with the inert higgs doublet ( idm ) model @xcite with conformal couplings to the ricci scalar .",
    "the mass terms which give rise to electroweak symmetry breaking are generated by the coleman - weinberg method  @xcite .",
    "the requirement of scale invariance at high energy scale and electro - weak symmetry breaking at low energies fixes the coupling constants of the theory .",
    "specifically we find that the quartic coupling of the inert doublet , predicts a spectral index of the power spectrum of the perturbations to be consistent with observations .",
    "the amplitude of the power spectrum @xmath5 can be tuned to be consistent with the observations by choosing a suitable curvaton mechanism .",
    "this model specifies the mass of the higgs boson to be @xmath6 gev and the mass of the dark matter @xmath7 gev which can be tested respectively at the lhc and in cosmic ray observations .",
    "the main aim of this paper has been to show that a higgs potential with not too small couplings can be a viable source of the observed scale invariant density perturbations .",
    "the scale invariant density perturbations become superhorizon during a phase of inflation at the electroweak scale .",
    "however other cosmological scenarios like a bounce models @xcite of making the density perturbations superhorizon may be equally viable with our model .    in section-2",
    "we describes the basics of the inert doublet model ( idm ) .",
    "the one - loop correction to the potential and the calculation for running of coupling constant are briefly discussed in section-3 .",
    "we study the generation of the scale invariant density perturbation from the inert higgs doublet in section-4 . in section-5",
    "we list the scalar mass spectrum predicted by this model and identify the dark matter candidate .",
    "inert doublet model ( idm ) is a economical extension of standard model which solves the problem of naturalness @xcite and it can also explain the electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite .",

    "are forbidden .",
    "this makes the inert doublet stable and its neutral component can be a candidate for dark matter .",

    "@xmath14 is the constant potential , which acts as cosmological constant and can be formed from the vev of different higgs fields .",
    "we have chosen @xmath15 such that the minimum of the total potential becomes zero at present era . in the early universe",
    "the cosmological constant gives rise to an exponential expansion during which the scale invariant perturbations of the phase of the neutral component of @xmath10 become super - horizon . to achieve this",
    "we need that the potential is such that in the early universe , @xmath16 and the neural component of @xmath10 rolls down this quartic potential while the minimum of @xmath9 is at @xmath17 . in the present era",
    "the potential should be such that the minima occurs at @xmath18 and @xmath19 which gives rise to the electro - weak symmetry breaking .",
    "we show in the next section how this is achieved by radiative corrections starting from a scale invariant tree level potential .",
    "we derive the one - loop correction to the potential ( [ vtree ] ) following coleman - weinberg formalism  @xcite . the generic one - loop correction to the potential can be written as  @xcite , + @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the spin of the fields and @xmath22 are the tree level masses , function of the higgs field .",

    "( [ divergence ] ) can be removed by adding the counter terms in the potential of the form , @xmath27 where @xmath28 denote the scalar fields , considered in the model .",
