    "the relativistic field theory of hadrons known as quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) has become a very useful tool for describing bulk and single - particle properties of nuclear matter and finite nuclei in the mean field approximation @xcite . compared with the non - relativistic approach to the nuclear many - body problem",
    ", the relativistic model explicitly includes the mesonic degrees of freedom and treats the nucleons as dirac particles . at the mean field",
    "( hartree ) level , nucleons interact in a relativistic covariant way by exchanging virtual mesons : an isoscalar - vector @xmath2 meson , an isoscalar - scalar @xmath3 meson and an isovector - vector @xmath4 meson . with these ingredients",
    "the mean field treatment of qhd automatically takes into account the spin  orbit force , the finite range and the density dependence of the nuclear force .",
    "adjusting some coupling constants and meson masses from the properties of a small number of finite nuclei , the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model produces excellent results for binding energies , root - mean - square radii , quadrupole and hexadecapole deformations and other properties of spherical and deformed nuclei @xcite .    the original linear @xmath1 model of walecka @xcite was complemented with cubic and quartic non - linearities of the @xmath3 meson @xcite ( non - linear @xmath1 model ) to improve the results for the incompressibility and for finite nuclei . since these models were proposed to be renormalizable ,",
    "the scalar self - interactions were limited to a quartic polynomial and scalar - vector or vector - vector interactions were not allowed . recently , and inspired by effective field theory ( eft ) , furnstahl , serot and tang @xcite abandoned the idea of renormalizability and extended the rmf theory by including other non - linear scalar - vector and vector - vector self - interactions as well as tensor couplings @xcite .",
    "the eft lagrangian has an infinite number of terms since it contains all the non - renormalizable couplings consistent with the underlying qcd symmetries .",
    "therefore , it is mandatory to develop a suitable scheme of expansion and truncation .",
    "at normal nuclear densities the scalar ( @xmath5 ) and vector ( @xmath6 ) meson fields are small compared with the nucleon mass ( @xmath7 ) , and they vary slowly with position in finite nuclei .",
    "this indicates that the ratios @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be used as the expansion parameters . with the help of the concept of naturalness , it is then possible to compute the contributions of the different terms in the expansion and to truncate the effective lagrangian at a given level of accuracy @xcite .",
    "none of the couplings should be arbitrarily dropped out to the given order without a symmetry argument .",
    "references @xcite have shown that it suffices to go to fourth order in the expansion . at this level one",
    "recovers the standard non - linear @xmath1 model plus a few additional couplings , with thirteen free parameters in all .",
    "these parameters have been fitted ( parameter sets g1 and g2 ) to reproduce some observables of magic nuclei @xcite . the fits display naturalness ( i.e. , all coupling constants are of the order of unity when written in appropriate dimensionless form ) , and the results are not dominated by the last terms retained .",
    "this evidence confirms the utility of the eft concepts and justifies the truncation of the effective lagrangian at the first lower orders .",
    "recent applications of the models based on eft include studies of pion - nucleus scattering @xcite and of the nuclear spin - orbit force @xcite , as well as calculations of asymmetric nuclear matter at finite temperature with the g1 and g2 sets @xcite . in a previous work @xcite",
    "we have analyzed the impact of each one of the new couplings introduced in the eft models on the nuclear matter saturation properties and on the nuclear surface properties . in ref.@xcite",
    "we have looked for constraints on the new parameters by demanding consistency with dbhf calculations and the properties of finite nuclei . during the last years",
    "a large amount of work has been devoted to measuring masses of nuclei far from stability @xcite .",
    "this body of experimental data has been used as a benchmark to test the predictions of the currently existent ( relativistic and non - relativistic ) nuclear effective forces @xcite .",
    "this fact motivates us to investigate in the present work the behaviour of the parameter sets g1 and g2 derived from eft in regions far from the stability line .    to study ground - state properties of spherical",
    "open - shell nuclei one has to take into account the pairing correlations .",
    "relativistic mean field calculations near the @xmath0-stability line have usually included pairing in a constant gap bcs approximation @xcite , with the gaps fitted to empirical odd - even mass differences .",
    "this approach works properly when the main effect of the pairing correlations is a smearing of the fermi surface .",
    "since the bcs pairing energy diverges for large momenta , a cut - off has to be introduced in the pairing channel to simulate phenomenologically the finite range of the particle - particle force .",
    "the limitations of this simple bcs method appear when one deals with nuclei far from the @xmath0-stability line .",
    "close to the drip lines the fermi level falls near the particle continuum and it is known that the bcs model does not provide a correct description of the coupling between bound and continuum states @xcite . in the non - relativistic framework this difficulty was overcome by the unified description of the mean field and the pairing correlations provided by the hartree  fock ",
    "bogoliubov ( hfb ) theory @xcite , with skyrme @xcite or gogny forces @xcite .",
    "the same unified treatment was developed by kucharek and ring @xcite in the relativistic framework .",
    "however , a quantitative description of the pairing correlations in nuclei can not be achieved with relativistic mean field parametrizations because the meson exchange forces are not properly adapted to large momentum transfer @xcite .",
    "later , ring and coworkers @xcite have used the rmf interaction for the particle - hole channel plus the pairing part of the gogny force @xcite ( with the d1s parameters @xcite ) for the particle - particle channel , in relativistic hartree - plus - bogoliubov ( rhb ) calculations .",
    "other authors have employed a density - dependent zero - range pairing force @xcite instead of the gogny pairing force @xcite .",
    "recent calculations with non - relativistic skyrme forces and a zero - range force in the particle - particle channel have shown that a bcs approach is able to provide a good qualitative estimate of the drip lines if some quasibound states due to their centrifugal barrier ( plus the coulomb barrier for protons ) are included in the calculation @xcite . in this work",
    "we will use a similar bcs approach with quasibound states to approximately take into account the effects of the continuum contributions near the drip lines .",
    "we will employ a constant pairing strength which can be considered as a simplification of the zero - range pairing force and which gives similar results to those obtained with a delta force for spherical nuclei @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we summarize the mean field approximation to the eft nuclear model in the second section . in the third section",
    "we describe our modified bcs approach with quasibound states , and perform some calculations to test its possibilities and limitations by comparing with bogoliubov results available from the literature .",
    "the fourth section is devoted to the detailed study with the eft parametrizations g1 and g2 of properties such as separation energies , particle densities and spin ",
    "orbit potentials of nuclei belonging to chains of isotopes ( isotones ) with magic proton ( neutron ) number .",
    "our conclusions are laid in the last section .",
    "the effective field theory approach to qhd has been developed in the recent years .",
    "the theory and the equations for nuclear matter and finite nuclei can be found in the literature @xcite and here we shall only outline the formalism .",
    "we start from ref.@xcite where the field equations were derived from an energy density functional containing dirac baryons and classical scalar and vector mesons .",
    "this functional can be obtained from the effective lagrangian in the hartree approximation , but it can also be considered as an expansion in terms of the ratios of the meson fields and their gradients to the nucleon mass of a general energy density functional that contains the contributions of correlations within the spirit of density functional theory @xcite .    according to refs .",

    "@xcite for the expressions of the variational equations .",
    "the terms with @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 take care of effects related with the electromagnetic structure of the pion and the nucleon ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . specifically , the constant @xmath20 concerns the coupling of the photon to the pions and the nucleons through the exchange of neutral vector mesons .",
    "the experimental value is @xmath24 .",

    "in this work we will employ the eft parameter sets g1 and g2 of refs.@xcite .",
    "the masses of the nucleon and the @xmath2 and @xmath4 mesons take their experimental values : @xmath28 mev , @xmath29 mev and @xmath30 mev .",
    "the thirteen parameters @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 were fitted by a least - squares optimization procedure to twenty - nine observables ( binding energies , charge form factors and spin  orbit splittings near the fermi surface ) of the nuclei @xmath44o , @xmath45ca , @xmath46ca , @xmath47sr and @xmath48pb , as described in ref.@xcite .",
    "the constants @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath49 were then chosen to reproduce the experimental charge radii of the nucleon .",
    "the fits yielded two best , distinct parameter sets ( g1 and g2 ) with essentially the same @xmath50 value @xcite .",
    "we report in table  1 the values of the parameters and the saturation properties of g1 and g2 .",
    "one observes that the fitted parameters differ significantly between both interactions .",
    "for example , g2 presents a positive value of @xmath39 , as opposite to g1 and to many of the most successful rmf parametrizations , such as the nl3 parameter set @xcite .",
    "formally a negative value of @xmath39 is not acceptable because the energy spectrum then has no lower bound @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the wrong sign in the @xmath51 coupling constant may cause troubles in obtaining stable solutions in light nuclei like @xmath52c .",
    "we note that the value of the effective mass at saturation @xmath53 in the eft sets ( @xmath54 ) is somewhat larger than the usual value in the rmf parameter sets ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "this fact is related with the presence of the tensor coupling @xmath41 of the @xmath2 meson to the nucleon , which has an important bearing on the spin  orbit force @xcite .",
    "one should mention that the eft perspective also has been helpful to elucidate the empirical success of the usual non - linear @xmath1 models that incorporate less couplings ( just up to cubic and quartic self - interactions of the scalar field ) : the eft approach accounts for the success of these rmf models and provides an expansion scheme at the mean field level and for going beyond it @xcite . in practice",
    "it has been seen that the mean field phenomenology of bulk and single - particle nuclear observables does not constrain all of the new parameters of the eft model unambiguosly .",
    "that is , the constants of the eft model are underdetermined by the observables currently included in the fits and different parameter sets with low @xmath50 ( comparable to g1 and g2 ) can be found @xcite .",
    "however , the extra couplings could prove to be very useful for the description of further observables .",
    "indeed , for densities above the normal saturation density , and owing to the additional non - linear couplings , the eft models are able @xcite to give an equation of state and nuclear matter scalar and vector self - energies in much better agreement with the microscopic dirac ",
    "brueckner  hartree ",
    "fock predictions than the standard non - linear @xmath1 parametrizations ( the latter completely fail in following the dbhf trends as the nuclear density grows @xcite ) .",
    "the sets g1 and g2 were fitted including centre - of - mass corrections in both the binding energy and the charge radius .",
    "therefore , we will utilize the same prescription of ref .",
    "@xcite in our calculations with g1 and g2 .",
    "namely , a correction @xmath56 to the binding energy and a correction @xmath57 to the mean - square charge radius .",
    "it is well known that pairing correlations have to be included in any realistic calculation of medium and heavy nuclei . in principle",
    "the microscopic hfb theory should be used for this purpose . however , for pairing calculations of a broad range of nuclei not too far from the @xmath0-stability line , a simpler procedure is usually considered in which a seniority potential acts between time - reversed orbitals . in this section we want to discuss and test a straightforward improvement of this simple approximation to be able to describe in addition nuclei near the drip lines , at least on a qualitative level . without the complications intrinsic to a full bogoliubov calculation , our faster approximation will allow us later on to perform extensive calculations of chains of isotopes and isotones with the relativistic parameter sets .",
    "the pairing correlation will be considered in the bcs approach @xcite .",

    ", here we choose a seniority - type interaction with a constant value of @xmath64 for pairs belonging to the active pairing shells .    the contribution of the pairing interaction to the total energy , for each kind of nucleon ( neutrons or protons ) , is @xmath65^{1/2 } \\bigg\\}^2-g\\sum_{\\alpha>0}n^2_{\\alpha } \\",

    "( [ eqfn28 ] ) and ( [ eqfn29 ] ) the pairing energy for each kind of nucleon can be written as @xmath75 this simple approach breaks down for nuclei far from the stability line .",
    "the reason is that in this case the number of neutrons ( for isotopes ) or protons ( for isotones ) increases , the corresponding fermi level approaches zero and the number of available levels above it is clearly reduced .",
    "moreover , in this situation the particle - hole and pair excitations reach the continuum . ref .",
    "@xcite showed that if one performs a bcs calculation using the same quasiparticle states as in a hfb calculation , then the bcs binding energies are close to the hfb ones but the r.m.s .",
    "radii ( i.e. , the single - particle wave functions ) dramatically depend on the size of the box where the calculation is performed .",
    "this is due to the fact that there are neutrons ( protons ) that occupy continuum states for which the wave functions are not localized in a region , thus giving rise to an unphysical neutron ( proton ) gas surrounding the nucleus .",
    "recent non - relativistic calculations near the drip lines with skyrme forces @xcite have shown that the above problem of the bcs approach can be corrected , in an approximate manner , by taking into account continuum effects by means of the so - called quasibound states , namely , states bound because of their own centrifugal barrier ( centrifugal - plus - coulomb barrier for protons ) . when the quasibound states are included in the bcs calculation ( from now on a qb - bcs calculation ) , it is necessary to prevent the unrealistic pairing of highly excited states and to confine the region of influence of the pairing potential to the vicinity of the fermi level . instead of using a cutoff factor as in ref .",
    "@xcite , in our calculations we will restrict the available space to one harmonic oscillator shell above and below the fermi level .    in order to check this approach we have performed with the g1 parameter set ( @xmath76 mev , see next section ) calculations of the binding energy and r.m.s .",
    "radius of the @xmath77sn and @xmath78sn nuclei in boxes of sizes between 15 and 25 fm ( as in the non - relativistic calculations of ref .",
    "the results taking into account the quasibound levels @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 for @xmath77sn , and @xmath82 and @xmath83 for @xmath78sn , are compared in figure  1 with the output of a standard bcs calculation with only bound levels .",
    "it turns out that in the qb - bcs case the results are essentially independent of the size of the box where the calculations are carried out .",
    "when the quasibound levels are included the binding energies are larger than when only the bound levels are taken into account , due to the damping of the pairing correlation caused by disregarding the continuum states in the standard bcs calculation @xcite .",
    "we also show in figure  1 the results of a bcs calculation using all bound and unbound levels ( i.e. , without restricting ourselves to quasibound levels ) in the considered range .",
    "it is obvious that in this case the results are box dependent , as the binding energy and neutron r.m.s .",
    "radius of @xmath78sn evidence .",
    "another test of the qb - bcs approach concerns the asymptotic behaviour of the particle densities @xcite . in figure  2",
    "we display the radial dependence of the neutron density of @xmath84sn ( as in ref.@xcite ) calculated with the g1 parameter set in boxes of radii between 15 and 25 fm . for large enough distances",
    "the density decreases smoothly when the size of the box increases ( except very near of the edge , where the density suddenly drops to zero because of the @xmath85 boundary condition ) .",
    "this means that no neutron gas surrounding the nucleus has appeared . in a bogoliubov calculation",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the particle density is governed by the square of the lower component of the single - quasiparticle wave function corresponding to the lowest quasiparticle energy @xcite .",
    "this asymptotic behaviour is displayed by the ( almost straight ) dotted line in figure  2 .",
    "it can be seen that the density obtained with our approach decreases more slowly than the rhb density , i.e. , asymptotically the qb - bcs density is not able to follow the rhb behaviour .",
    "this coincides with the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see figure  19 of that work ) where non - relativistic hfb densities are compared for large distances with the densities obtained in the qb - bcs approach with a state - dependent pairing @xcite .    although the qb - bcs densities do not display the right asymptotic behaviour , it was conjectured in ref .",
    "@xcite that such an approach could allow one to compute properties of nuclei much closer to the drip lines than in a standard bcs calculation . very recently , rhb calculations up to the drip lines of the two - neutron separation energy @xmath86 for nickel isotopes @xcite and of the charge and neutron r.m.s .",
    "radii for tin isotopes @xcite have been carried out using the nl - sh parameter set @xcite plus a density - dependent zero - range pairing force .",
    "we have repeated these calculations with our qb - bcs method for both isotopic chains ( with a pairing interaction strength @xmath87 in the case of nl - sh ) .",
    "we display the values of the @xmath86 separation energies for the ni chain in figure  3a .",
    "the rhb calculation predicts the drip line at the isotope @xmath88ni and shows shell effects at @xmath89 and 50 ( and to a minor extent at @xmath90 ) .",
    "these features are well predicted by our simpler qb - bcs calculation .",
    "the differences between these qb - bcs and rhb results also come in part from the different pairing forces used in the calculations . to investigate this point",
    "we show in figure  3b the neutron pairing energy obtained in our approach [ eq.([eqfn32 ] ) ] for the isotopes of the ni chain .",
    "it vanishes at @xmath91 , 50 and 70 , in agreement with the shell structure shown in figure  3a by the @xmath86 separation energies .",
    "the largest pairing energies are found in the middle of two closed shells and they are enhanced by increasing @xmath92 .",
    "figure  3b can be compared with the rhb values displayed in figure  2 of ref .",
    "the tendencies are the same , though the qb - bcs pairing energies are slightly larger than in the rhb calculation . in figure",
    "4 we draw our results for the radii of the sn isotopes , and compare them with the rhb values . in the case of the charge radii the agreement is excellent .",
    "the neutron radii obtained in our method closely follow the behaviour of the rhb neutron radii and the kink at @xmath93 is qualitatively reproduced .",
    "we have furthermore computed the binding energies of nuclei of the @xmath94 isotonic chain for which rhb results exist with the nl3 parameter set @xcite .",
    "we present the extracted two - proton separation energies @xmath95 in table  2 .",
    "the agreement between the qb - bcs and rhb approaches again is very good . in both models",
    "the last stable nucleus is @xmath96fe , as in experiment .",
    "notice that in the present case the first levels with positive energy correspond to those of the @xmath97 shell .",
    "due to the coulomb barrier all these levels become quasibound in our approach , and it is expected that they will lie close to the canonical levels .",
    "this explains the goodness of the qb - bcs energies for this isotonic chain .",
    "> from the previous comparisons we see that the simple qb - bcs calculation is able to reasonably follow the main trends of the more fundamental rhb pairing calculation .",
    "one can also conclude that the consideration of quasibound states in the bcs approach is , actually , a key ingredient to eliminate the spurious nucleon gas arising near the drip lines .",
    "we want to analyze the ability of the g1 and g2 parameter sets based on effective field theory @xcite to describe nuclear properties far from the stability line , i.e. , far from the region where the parameters were fitted . to our knowledge",
    "such calculations have not been explored so far .",
    "we will contrast the results with experiment and with those predicted by the nl3 set , that we take as one of the best representatives of the usual rmf model with only scalar self - interactions .",
    "as indicated , we shall use a schematic pairing with a state - independent matrix element @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is a constant and @xmath100 for neutrons or protons , respectively .",
    "we fix the constant @xmath101 for neutrons by looking for the best agreement of our calculation with the known experimental binding energies of ni and sn isotopes .",
    "similarly , we determine @xmath102 for protons from the experimental binding energies of the isotones of @xmath89 and @xmath103 .",
    "the values obtained from this fit are @xmath104 mev and @xmath105 mev for the g1 set , @xmath106 mev and @xmath107 mev for g2 , and finally @xmath108 mev and @xmath109 mev for nl3 .",
    "figure  5 shows that the neutron and proton state - independent gaps ( @xmath110 and @xmath111 ) predicted by our calculation with g1 are scattered around the empirical average curve @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "a similar picture is found with the parameter sets g2 and nl3 .      in figure",
    "6a we present the two - neutron separation energies @xmath86 for the chain of ni isotopes .",
    "clear shell effects arise at @xmath89 and 50 .",
    "the three relativistic interactions ( g1 , g2 and nl3 ) slightly overestimate the shell effect at @xmath89 as compared with the experimental value , which also happens in more sophisticated rhb calculations with nl3 @xcite . in our qb - bcs approach",
    "some disagreement with experiment is found for the @xmath113 and @xmath114 isotopes .",
    "again , this also occurs in the rhb calculations of refs.@xcite with nl3 .",
    "however , if we compare figure  6a with the results that we have shown in figure  3a for the nl - sh parameter set , we see that nl - sh achieves a better agreement with experiment for these @xmath113 and @xmath114 isotopes .",
    "we stop our calculation towards the neutron drip line when the two - neutron separation energy vanishes or when the neutron chemical potential becomes positive .",
    "the fact that @xmath86 is not always zero at the drip line is connected with the quenching of the shell structure with @xmath92 , which is a force - dependent property @xcite .",
    "this effect is illustrated in figure  25 of ref .",
    "@xcite for hfb calculations with different non - relativistic forces .",
    "we find similar situations with the considered relativistic sets in our qb - bcs calculations of separation energies . in the case of the ni isotopes we reach the drip line at @xmath115 with the g1 and nl3 sets and at @xmath116 with the g2 set .",
    "this agrees nicely with the value @xmath115 obtained in hfb calculations with the skyrme forces siii @xcite and skp @xcite . for nl - sh",
    "our qb - bcs scheme predicts the drip line at @xmath117 ( see figure  3a ) , the same value found in the rhb calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in figure  7a we display our qb - bcs results for the two - neutron separation energies of the sn isotopic chain . in ref .  @xcite it was claimed that pure bcs calculations in the constant gap approach ( with nl3 ) are not suitable for the sn isotopes .",
    "we observe in figure  7a that below @xmath118 , as one moves towards @xmath119 , some discrepancies with the experimental values appear , which also arise in the rhb calculations @xcite .",
    "the three forces slightly overestimate the shell effect at @xmath103 ( as the rhb results of refs.@xcite for nl3 ) .",
    "we have computed sn isotopes up to @xmath120 , when @xmath86 vanishes for nl3 ( in good agreement with rhb results for nl - sh @xcite and hfb results for the skyrme force skp @xcite ) .",
    "for g1 and g2 we find that @xmath86 does not yet vanish at @xmath121 , and it is not possible to increase the neutron number due to the shell closure at @xmath121 ( the neutron chemical potential becomes positive for the @xmath122 isotope ) .",

    "nl3 would predict another shell effect at @xmath129 , which does not appear experimentally .",
    "the effect is less pronounced in g1 and it does not show up in g2 .",

    "the quenching of the shell effect at @xmath128 is larger for g2 than for g1 and nl3 .",
    "the available data for two - proton separation energies of @xmath121 isotones are reasonably well estimated by the relativistic sets . however , the trend of nl3 is worse than that of g1 and g2 .",
    "it would then be very interesting to perform rhb calculations of this chain to confirm the behaviour of nl3 .",
    "the last nucleus of the chain stable against two - proton emission is @xmath133u according to g1 and nl3 , and @xmath134pu according to g2 .",
    "the three sets predict a shell effect at @xmath135 , though it is relatively quenched for g2 .",
    "we have computed one - neutron ( one - proton ) separation energies for ni and sn isotopes ( for @xmath89 and @xmath103 isotones ) .",
    "the results are displayed in figures  6b and 7b ( 9b and 10b ) , respectively . to deal with odd mass number nuclei",
    "we have used a spherical blocking approximation .",
    "one pair of conjugate states @xmath136 and @xmath137 is blocked , i.e. , taken out of the pairing scheme @xcite . in the spherical approximation one replaces the blocked single - particle state by an average over the degenerate states in its @xmath138 shell . this way the rotational and time - reversal invariance of the many - body system",
    "is restored in the intrinsic frame @xcite . in this approach",
    "the contribution of the @xmath138 shell that contains the blocked state to the number of active particles and the pairing energy is @xmath139 e_{{\\rm pair } , j } & = & -g \\ , ( 2j-1 ) [ n_j(1-n_j ) ] ^{1/2 } , \\label{eqfn34 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "the remaining active shells contribute in the usual manner [ eqs .",
    "( [ eqfn27 ] ) and ( [ eqfn31 ] ) ] . due to rearrangement effects , blocking the single - particle state with smallest quasiparticle energy @xmath140 in the even @xmath141 nucleus , does not necessarily lead to the largest binding energy of the odd @xmath74 nucleus .",
    "therefore , in some cases one has to repeat the calculation blocking in turn the different single - particle states that lie around the fermi level to find the configuration of largest binding energy @xcite .",
    "the one - neutron ( one - proton ) separation energies lie over two different curves for even and odd neutron ( proton ) number . for ni isotopes ( figure  6b ) the three parameter sets g1 , g2 and nl3 reproduce reasonably the experimental values .",

    "the heaviest ni isotope stable against one - neutron emission is found at @xmath142 with nl3 and g1 and at @xmath143 with g2 . for sn isotopes ( figure 7b ) the shell effect at @xmath103",
    "is slightly overestimated by the studied forces .",
    "the predictions of the three parametrizations are roughly similar up to @xmath144 , where the behaviour of nl3 starts to depart from g1 and g2 due to the large quenching of the @xmath121 shell effect shown by nl3 as compared with g1 and g2 . in our calculations ,",
    "the odd sn isotopes become unstable against the emission of one neutron around @xmath144 . this value is larger than the values found with the non - relativistic skp interaction in hfb ( @xmath145 ) or hf+bcs ( @xmath146 ) calculations @xcite .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy lies in the fact that the shell distribution in tin isotopes around @xmath121 for skp is rather different from that of the relativistic sets @xcite .",
    "the one - proton separation energies for the isotones of @xmath89 ( figure  9b ) show an overall good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the shell effects at @xmath124 and @xmath125 are rather well reproduced by the forces analyzed here .",
    "g1 and g2 predict the heaviest nucleus stable against one - proton emission to be @xmath147cu , as in experiment , while it is unstable in the nl3 calculation . for the isotones of @xmath103 ( figure  10b ) the shell effect predicted by nl3 and g1 at @xmath128 is similar . again , as for @xmath95 ( figure  10a ) , nl3 predicts a shell effect at @xmath129 which is not found experimentally , whereas for g1 this effect is clearly smaller and it does not appear for g2 .",
    "the last stable nucleus against one - proton emission is @xmath148tm according to the three parameter sets .",
    "the nuclear densities for chains of isotopes of light and medium size nuclei have recently been studied in the rhb approximation @xcite .",
    "as @xmath92 grows the neutron and mass densities extend outwards and the r.m.s .",
    "radii and the surface thickness increase .",
    "special attention has been payed to the isospin dependence of the spin ",
    "orbit interaction .",
    "the magnitude of the spin  orbit potential is reduced when one approaches the neutron drip line and , as a consequence , there is a reduction of the energy splittings between spin ",
    "orbit partner levels @xcite . to our knowledge , for isotones such",
    "an study has only been carried out in the @xmath94 chain @xcite .",
    "it is to be remarked that the eft parametrizations g1 and g2 contain a tensor coupling of the @xmath2 meson to the nucleon which plays a very important role in the spin ",
    "orbit force because there exists a trade - off between the size of this coupling and the size of the scalar field @xcite .    in figures  12a and 12b we display , respectively , the neutron and proton densities of some @xmath89 isotones from @xmath149 to @xmath127 as predicted by the g2 set in our qb - bcs approach .",
    "figures  13a and 13b show the results for some @xmath103 isotones from @xmath150 to @xmath151 .",
    "since @xmath92 is fixed in each isotonic chain , the spatial extension of the neutron densities is very similar for the different nuclei of the chain . in any case , as one goes from the lightest to the heaviest isotone of the chain , the neutron densities tend to be depressed in the interior region and their surface thickness ( 90%10% fall - off distance ) shows a decreasing tendency .",
    "the proton densities of the isotones exhibit a strong dependence on @xmath132 : by adding more protons they are raised at the interior and their surface is pushed outwards . for @xmath89",
    "the surface thickness of @xmath152 remains roughly constant up to @xmath125 and increases for heavier isotones as a consequence of the growing occupation of the @xmath153 shell . at the origin",
    "the proton densities show a bump when @xmath154 because the @xmath155 level is occupied .",
    "the @xmath149 isotone shows a dip at the centre due to , precisely , the emptiness of this @xmath155 level . for",
    "the considered nuclei of @xmath103 , the proton densities have an approximately constant surface thickness and present a hole at the centre owing to the coulomb repulsion . in figure  14",
    "we display the neutron and proton r.m.s .",
    "radii of the @xmath103 isotonic chain obtained with g2 and nl3 .",
    "it turns out that the predictions of both sets are very similar .",
    "the proton radii increase uniformly with @xmath132 , similarly to the behaviour found for @xmath94 isotones with nl3 and the rhb scheme in ref .",
    "the neutron radii remain roughly constant with @xmath132 .",
    "they just show a slight decrease with increasing @xmath132 till @xmath156 and slightly increase afterwards .",
    "this behaviour may be related with the shell effect for protons at @xmath128 .",
    "orbit interaction is automatically included in the rmf approximation .",
    "it appears explicitly when the lower spinor of the relativistic wave function is eliminated in favour of the upper spinor .",
    "this way one obtains a schrdinger - like equation with a term @xmath157 that has the structure of the single - particle spin  orbit potential .",
    "including the contribution of the tensor coupling of the @xmath2 meson , the spin  orbit term reads @xcite @xmath158 v_{so}(r ) & = & \\frac{m^2}{{\\overline{m}}^2 } \\frac{1}{r } \\left ( \\frac{d \\phi}{d r } + \\frac{d w}{d r } \\right ) + 2 f_{v } \\frac{m}{\\overline{m } } \\frac{1}{r } \\frac{d w}{d r } , \\label{eqso1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath159 .",
    "we have checked numerically that the contribution to the spin  orbit potential of the @xmath49 tensor coupling of the @xmath4 meson is very small , even when one approaches the drip lines .",
    "hence we have not written this contribution in eq .",
    "( [ eqso1 ] ) .",
    "the spin  orbit potential ( [ eqso1 ] ) for some lead isotopes computed with g2 and nl3 is displayed in figures  15a and 15b , respectively . as a general trend , for both g2 and nl3 , when the number of neutrons is increased the depth of the spin  orbit potential decreases gradually and the position of the bottom of the well",
    "is shifted outwards , which implies a significant weakening of the spin ",
    "orbit interaction .",
    "the same effect arises in other isotopic chains in rhb calculations @xcite . comparing the spin ",
    "orbit potentials obtained with the g2 and nl3 sets , one sees that they have a similar strength for all the isotopes analyzed and that the minima of the wells are located at similar positions ( slightly shifted to larger values of @xmath160 in g2 ) .",
    "the higher effective mass of g2 at saturation ( @xmath161 ) with respect to nl3 ( @xmath162 ) is compensated by the tensor coupling included in g2 ( @xmath163 ) . to ascertain the relative importance of the tensor coupling we have drawn in the insert of figure  15a , for @xmath164pb , the full potential ( [ eqso1 ] ) and the contribution resulting from setting @xmath165 in eq .  ( [ eqso1 ] ) .",
    "we see that the full @xmath166 is much deeper and wider .",
    "the maximum depth of @xmath166 changes from @xmath167 mev  @xmath168 ( right scale of the insert ) to @xmath169 mev  @xmath168 when @xmath165 .",
    "that is , the tensor coupling accounts for roughly one third of the total spin ",
    "orbit strength in the g2 parameter set .",
    "one expects that the weakening of the spin  orbit potential in going to the neutron drip line will bring about a reduction of the spin ",
    "orbit splittings @xmath170 of the neutron levels @xcite .",
    "figure  16 displays the energy splittings of some spin  orbit partner levels of neutrons for lead isotopes , obtained with the g2 and nl3 parameter sets .",
    "the splittings predicted by g2 and nl3 are very close as a consequence of the similarity of the corresponding spin ",
    "orbit potentials .",
    "partner levels with high angular momentum undergo some reduction in the splitting along the pb isotopic chain , but partners with small angular momentum show an almost constant splitting . by comparison of their rhb results for ni and sn , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the weakening of the spin ",
    "orbit interaction should be less important for heavier isotopic chains .",
    "our calculations for pb would confirm this statement .",
    "all the single - particle levels involved in figure  16 are bound . of course",
    ", one should not expect the results for @xmath171 to be so reliable in our qb - bcs approach if one , or both , of the partner levels lies at positive energy .",
    "the reason is that the single - particle energies of the quasibound levels do not exactly reproduce the energies of the corresponding canonical states of a rhb calculation .    in figures  17a and 17b we show the spin",
    " orbit potential for isotones of @xmath103 from @xmath150 to @xmath151 , for the g2 and nl3 parametrizations .",
    "similarly to what is found for isotopes , the results obtained from g2 and from nl3 are comparable and the spin  orbit potential well @xmath166 moves outwards with the addition of protons , following the tendency of the proton density . however",
    ", for isotones we find that the behaviour of the depth of the spin  orbit potential well is not so monotonous : it increases when one goes from the neutron drip line up to the @xmath0-stable region , while it decreases afterwards as more protons are added .",
    "we have analyzed the pairing properties of some chains of isotopes and isotones with magic @xmath132 and @xmath92 numbers in the relativistic mean field approach .",
    "the study has been performed for the g1 and g2 parametrizations that were obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite from the modern effective field theory approach to relativistic nuclear phenomenology .",
    "we have compared the results with those obtained with the nl3 parameter set which is considered to be very successful for dealing with nuclei beyond the stability line .    for accurate calculations of pairing far from the valley of @xmath0-stability in the relativistic models , the relativistic hartree ",
    "bogoliubov approach should be applied .",
    "however , we have presented a simpler modified bcs approach which allows one to obtain pairing properties near the drip lines fast and confidently .",
    "the method has been used previously in non - relativistic calculations with skyrme forces @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient is to take into account the continuum contributions through quasibound levels due to their centrifugal barrier . to further simplify the calculations we have assumed pairing matrix elements of the type @xmath172 instead of , e.g. , a state - dependent pairing with a zero - range force .",
    "the considered quasibound levels are mainly localized in the classically allowed region and decrease exponentially outside it .",
    "this eliminates the unphysical nucleon gas which , near the drip lines , surrounds the nucleus when all available positive energy levels are included in the usual bcs approach . normally , the quasibound levels have high angular momentum and lie close in energy to the corresponding rhb canonical levels .",
    "one of the limitations of the qb - bcs approach employed here is the fact that the nuclear density does not follow the asymptotic fall - off of the densities computed with the relativistic hartree - plus - bogoliubov theory . in spite of this shortcoming ,",
    "we have shown by comparison with available rhb results that the qb - bcs approach is able to predict the position of the drip lines , or the behaviour of the neutron and charge radii for nuclei far from the stability line , in a reasonable way .",
    "also , the obtained pairing gaps are nicely scattered around the empirical average @xmath112 .",
    "we have applied the qb - bcs approach to the ni , sn and pb isotopic chains , and to the @xmath89 , 50 , 82 and 126 isotonic chains .",
    "the two - neutron ( two - proton ) and one - neutron ( one - proton ) separation energies , as well as the resulting shell gaps , are similar for the three studied relativistic parametrizations ( g1 , g2 and nl3 ) and in general they reproduce the available experimental data , at least qualitatively .",
    "the neutron and proton drip lines are usually reached at the same place with the three forces , though one may find a shift of one or two units of @xmath74 among them .",
    "we have paid some attention to the quenching of the shell structure near the drip lines .",
    "for example , the quenching of the shell effect at @xmath121 for sn isotopes is larger in nl3 than in g1 and g2 , while for pb isotopes none of the three sets exhibits a quenching of the shell effect at @xmath123 in our qb - bcs calculation .",
    "the eft parametrizations g1 and g2 contain tensor couplings that are not present in the rmf parametrizations like nl3 and have a larger effective mass at saturation . however , the predicted spin ",
    "orbit potentials along the isotopic and isotonic chains do not differ much from those obtained with nl3 .",
    "our analysis shows that the parameter sets based on eft are able to describe nuclei far from the @xmath0-stability line , after adding a phenomenological pairing residual interaction .",
    "only experimental information about some magic nuclei was utilized in the fit of the constants of the g1 and g2 sets and , thus , the results for nuclei near the drip lines are veritable predictions of the model . in spite of the fact that the eft sets include more couplings and parameters than the conventional rmf sets like nl3 , both models reproduce the experimental systematics with a similar quality .",
    "in fact , the studied properties away from the valley of @xmath0-stability do not seem to provide further constraints on the eft parameters , not even in the isovector sector . in conclusion ,",
    "extended sets like g1 and g2 will serve almost the same purposes for normal systems as the conventional parameter sets .",
    "however , some of the extra parameters of the general eft functional may be used to better describe regions of the equation of state at higher density or temperature @xcite without spoiling the systematics for finite nuclei .",
