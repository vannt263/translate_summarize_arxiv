    "a common free energy source that can drive turbulence in neutral ( or more precisely : non - conducting ) fluids is a strong enough gradient ( or `` shear '' ) in flow velocity , which can lead to vortex formation by kelvin - helmholtz instability .",
    "examples for turbulence occuring from this type of instability are forced pipe flows , where a velocity shear layer is developing at the wall boundary , or a fast jet streaming into a stationary fluid .",

    "examples of microscopic models are molecular dynamics ( md ) methods for neutral fluids that model motion of many particles connected by short range interactions @xcite , or particle - in - cell ( pic ) methods for plasmas including electromagnetic forces @xcite .",
    "such methods become important when relevant microscopic effects are not covered by the averaging procedures used to obtain meso- or macroscopic models , but they usually are intrinsical computationally expensive .",

    "an example of a mesoscopic computational model for fluid flow is the lattice boltzmann method ( lbm ) that combines free streaming particle motion by a minimalistic discretisation in velocity space with suitable models for collision operators in such a way that fluid motion is recovered on macroscopic scales .",

    "usually , kinetic theory and computation for gas and plasma dynamics make use of further simplifying approximations that considerably reduce the complexity : in the vlasov equation binary collisions are neglected ( @xmath5 ) , and in the drift - kinetic or gyro - kinetic plasma equations further reducing assumptions are taken about the time and space scales under consideration .",

    "flow instabilities as a cause for turbulence , like those driven by flow shear or thermal convection , do in principle also exist in plasmas similar to neutral fluids @xcite , but are in general found to be less dominant in strongly magnetised plasmas . the most important mechanism which results in turbulent transport and enhanced mixing relevant to confinement in magnetised plasmas @xcite is an unstable growth of coupled wave - like perturbations in plasma pressure @xmath19 and electric fields @xmath20 .",
    "the electric field forces a flow with the exb ( `` e - cross - b '' ) drift velocity @xmath21 of the plasma perpendicular to the magnetic field * b*. a phase shift , caused by any inhibition of a fast parallel boltzmann response of the electrons , between pressure and electric field perturbation in the presence of a pressure gradient can lead to an effective transport of plasma across the magnetic field and to an unstable growth of the perturbation amplitude .",
    "nonlinear self - advection of the exb flow and coupling between perturbation modes ( `` drift waves '' ) can finally lead to a fully developed turbulent state with strongly enhanced mixing .",
    "a generic source of free energy for magnetised laboratory plasma turbulence resides in the pressure gradient : in the core of a magnetic confinement region both plasma density and temperature are usually much larger than near the bounding material wall , resulting in a pressure gradient directed inwards to the plasma center .",
    "instabilities which tap this free energy tend to lead to enhanced mixing and transport of energy and particles down the gradient @xcite . for magnetically confined fusion plasmas , this turbulent convection by exb drift waves often dominates collisional diffusive transport mechanisms by orders of magnitude , and essentially determines energy and particle confinement properties @xcite .",
    "the drift wave turbulence is regulated by formation of mesoscopic streamers and zonal structures out of the turbulent flows @xcite .",
    "continuum models for drift wave turbulence have to capture the different dynamics of electrons and ions parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field and the coupling between both species by electric and magnetic interactions @xcite .",
    "therefore , a single - fluid magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) model can not appropriately describe drift wave dynamics : one has to refer to a set of two - fluid equations , treating electrons and ions as separate species , although the plasma on macroscopic scales remains quasi - neutral with nearly identical ion and electron density , @xmath22 .",
    "the two - fluid equations require quantities like collisional momentum exchange rate , pressure tensor and heat flux to be expressed by hydrodynamic moments based on solution of a kinetic ( fokker - planck ) model .",

    "are covering all time and space scales , including detailed gyro - motion of particles around the magnetic field lines , and the fast plasma frequency oscillations . from experimental observation",
    "it is on the other hand evident @xcite , that the dominant contributions to turbulence and transport in magnetised plasmas originate from time and space scales that are associated with frequencies in the order the drift frequency @xmath23 , that are much lower than the ion gyro - frequency @xmath24 by the ratio between drift scale @xmath25 to gradient length @xmath26 : @xmath27 under these assumptions one can apply a `` drift ordering '' based on the smallness of the order parameter @xmath28 .",
    "this can be introduced either on the kinetic level , resulting in the drift - kinetic model , or on the level of two - fluid moment equations for the plasma , resulting in the `` drift - reduced two - fluid equations '' , or simply called `` drift wave equations '' @xcite : neglect of terms scaling with @xmath29 in higher powers than 2 considerably simplifies both the numerical and analytical treatment of the dynamics , while retaining all effects of the perpendicular drift motion of guiding centers and nonlinear couplings that are necessary to describe drift wave turbulence .    for finite ion temperature , the ion gyro - radius @xmath30 can be of the same magnitude as typical fluctuation scales , with wave numbers found around @xmath31 in the order of the drift scale @xmath32 although the gyro - motion is still fast compared to turbulent time scales , the ion orbit then is of similar size as spatial variations of the fluctuating electrostatic potential",
    ". finite gyro - radius ( or `` finite larmor radius '' , flr ) effects are captured by appropriate averaging procedures over the gyrating particle trajectory and modification of the polarisation equation , resulting in `` gyrokinetic '' or `` gyrofluid models '' for the plasma .",

    "plasmas exhibits large - scale structure formation that is linked to this small - scale eddy motion : the genesis of mean zonal flow structures out of an initially nearly homogeneous isotropic vortex field and the resulting shear - flow suppression of the driving turbulence is a particular example of a self - organising regulation process in a dynamical system @xcite .",

    "basic concepts and terminology for the interaction between vortex turbulence and mean flows have been first developed in the context of neutral fluids .",
    "it is therefore instructive to briefly review these relations in the framework of the navier - stokes eq .",
    "( [ e : nse ] ) before applying them to plasma dynamics .",
    "small ( space and/or time ) scale vortices and mean flows may be separated formally by an ansatz known as reynolds decomposition , @xmath33 splitting the flow velocity into a mean part @xmath34 , averaged over the separation scale , and small - scale fluctuations @xmath35 with @xmath36 . while the averaging procedure , @xmath37 , is mathematically most unambiguous for the ensemble average , the physical interpretation in fluid dynamics makes a time or space decomposition more appropriate . applying this averaging on the navier - stokes eq .",

    "mean flows can thus be caused by a mean pressure gradient , viscous forces , and reynolds stress .",
    "a practical application of the rans is in large eddy simulation ( les ) of fluid turbulence , which efficiently reduces the time and space scales necessary for computation by _ modelling _ the reynolds stress tensor for the smaller scales as a local function of the large scale flow .",
    "les is however not applicable for drift wave turbulence computations , as here in any case all scales down to the effective gyro - radius ( or drift scale @xmath40 ) have to be resolved in direct numerical simulation ( dns ) .",
    "turbulent flows are generically three - dimensional . in some particular situations",
    "the dependence of the convective flow dynamics on one of the cartesian directions can be negligible compared to the others and the turbulence becomes quasi two - dimensional @xcite .",

    "also the perpendicular exb dynamics in magnetised plasmas behaves similar to a 2d fluid @xcite .",
