    "it has been known for nearly a century that a large population of asteroids , known as trojan asteroids , exists in a 1:1 resonance with jupiter .",
    "neptune is known to have five trojan asteroids , but the only rocky planet with known trojan asteroids is mars . at present , the number of confirmed mars trojan asteroids is four , with a handful of other candidates . all but one orbit in the l5 ( trailing ) zone , with 1 in the l4 ( leading ) zone .",
    "mars trojans can be dynamically stable over the age of the solar system at inclinations between 12  and 40  degrees @xcite ; all known and candidate mars trojans reside in this dynamically stable region of phase space and may therefore be primordial objects .",
    "if so , these bodies represent leftover planetesimals from the formation of mars .",
    "it is therefore interesting that there is evidence that suggests a diverse history for these bodies . @xcite",
    "obtained visible spectra of the three largest mars trojans  ( 5261 )  eureka , ( 101429 ) 1998  vf@xmath0 , and ( 121514 ) 1999  uj@xmath4  and found that eureka and 1998  vf@xmath0 are likely sa- or a - class asteroids , whereas 1999  uj@xmath5 is probably an x - class asteroid .",
    "these differing compositions suggest that these asteroids can not have all formed in the same protostellar disk environment .",
    "@xcite , a companion paper , extend the previous paper , finding that eureka is angritic ( igneous , from an oxidized , carbonaceous chondritic precursor ) , whereas 1998  vf@xmath0 is likely a primitive achondrite ( from a reduced origin ) .",
    "the rivkin spectra represent the total published knowledge of the physical properties of mars trojans . clearly , additional data are needed to characterize these unique objects and unravel the population s history , since mars trojans may represent the only known planetesimals that formed interior to the asteroid belt , and are the closest approximations to earth s building blocks currently known .    we have obtained the first thermal infrared measurements of three mars trojan asteroids : ( 5261 ) eureka , ( 101429 ) 1998  vf@xmath0 , and 2001  fr@xmath1 ( this last being unconfirmed as a mars trojan due to lack of long - term dynamical integrations ) . here",
    "we present our data ( including some ancillary visible wavelength data ) ; thermal modeling ; and the resulting derived diameters and albedos .",
    "we briefly discuss the implications of our results , including their general agreement with the taxa presented in @xcite .",
    "2001  fr@xmath1 was discovered in march , 2001 , and recovered two weeks later @xcite .",
    "on the basis of this arc , it was identified as a candidate mars trojan asteroid .",
    "( for simplicity , we refer this body hereafter simply as a mars trojan . ) however , at the time of our gemini observations four years later , the positional uncertainty for this object was around 0.67  degrees , far too large to be usefully targeted with gemini / michelle ( see below ) , whose field of view is less than 1  arcminute . before our thermal infrared observations",
    "could be carried out , therefore , 2001  fr@xmath1 needed to be recovered to reduce its positional uncertainty .",
    "we carried out a wide - area recovery program in may and june , 2005 , using 90prime , the prime focus camera on the university of arizona / steward observatory 90-inch ( 2.3-meter ) bok telescope on kitt peak .",
    "90prime has an array of four 4096@xmath64096 ccds ; the sides of the array span 1.16  deg , and the total imaged area of the sky is 1  deg@xmath7 per pointing @xcite .",
    "we imaged a series of overlapping fields along the projected location of 2001  fr@xmath1 .",
    "we used a modified version of the deep ecliptic survey data reduction and moving object detection pipeline @xcite to search for 2001  fr@xmath1 , and found it on multiple images .",
    "these new astrometric positions @xcite allowed a substantial refinement of the orbital elements and a consequent reduction in positional uncertainty for 2001  fr@xmath1 . at the time of our gemini observations of 2001  fr@xmath1 one month after recovery ,",
    "the positional uncertainty was less than an arcsecond .",
    "in order to detect or place limits on any visible lightcurves , we observed eureka and 1998  vf@xmath0 in v  band ( predicted magnitudes from horizons : 18.9 and 20.6 , respectively ) on 2005  sep  19 ut with the facility 2k  ccd ( ccd21 ) imager on the steward observatory mt .",
    "bigelow 61-inch ( 1.54-meter ) kuiper telescope .",
    "the night was not photometric , so we can not independently determine the v  magnitude of the asteroids .",
    "each asteroid was easily detected in a series of 60  second exposures .",
    "2001  fr@xmath1 was also attempted , but was too faint ( predicted magnitude v=22.3 from horizons ) to be detected in 90  second exposures .",
    "our time baseline was quite short  around 20  minutes for each of the two detected asteroids .",
    "no significant variation in flux from either asteroid was detected ( using relative photometry to three comparably bright comparison stars that are nearby in the images ) .",
    "for the bright eureka , our non - detection of flux variation places a 3@xmath8  limit on any lightcurve variation of 0.1  mag over the 20  minute observation window .",
    "this upper limit is consistent with the @xcite measurement ( from a different epoch ) of a lightcurve amplitude at least 0.15  mag over around 6  hours . for the relatively faint 1998  vf@xmath0 ,",
    "the 3@xmath8  limit on any lightcurve variation is around 1  magnitude over the 20  minute observation window . both of these non - detections are useful in eliminating the possibility of fast rotations and extreme shapes , which would be suggested by large flux variations over these short time windows .",
    "mars trojan asteroids eureka , 1998  vf@xmath0 , and 2001  fr@xmath1 were observed in queue mode on 2005  jul  6 ( ut ) at the gemini north telescope on mauna kea using michelle , a mid - infrared imager and spectrometer @xcite . in imaging mode",
    ", michelle has a field of view of 32@xmath924@xmath10 , with pixels 0.1  arcsec on a side .",
    "we used the @xmath11 ( @xmath12  microns , @xmath13  microns ) and @xmath14 ( @xmath15  microns , @xmath16  microns ) filters ( see table  [ obslog ] for the observing log ) .",
    "the telescope was tracked at asteroid ( non - sidereal ) rates .",
    "we employed the standard chop - nod strategy in which the telescope secondary chops ( several hertz ) and the telescope nods ( few times a minute ) between nearby ( 8  arcsec ) pointings in order to subtract out the thermal background from the telescope and atmosphere .",
    "the data was processed using the midir package of the gemini iraf package .",
    "the mireduce task conveniently performs all the standard tasks of reorganizing data structures and stacking the chop - nod images to produce final double - differenced images . in each image stack for this program only a single target appears , at very close to its predicted location , so there is no confusion as to whether the measured source is the targeted source .",
    "the exceptions are the @xmath11  image of 2001  fr@xmath1 and the @xmath14  image of 1998  vf@xmath0 , in which no sources are evident at all ; we derive upper limits to the fluxes for these two observations , as described below . in all cases ,",
    "the images in the `` off '' positions are unguided and somewhat smeared , so we measure photometry from only the `` on '' ( guided ) positions .",
    "each `` on '' source has one half of the total integration time .    three photometric calibrator stars ( see @xcite and the gemini web pages )",
    "were observed using the same observing mode ( tables  [ obslog ] and  [ results ] ) . for each standard star",
    ", we measured the total flux using aperture photometry .",
    "the extinction we derived from these calibration measurements is consistent with zero .",
    "the eureka and 1998  vf@xmath0 @xmath11 observations each were made with 24  total nods .",
    "for the eureka observations , the image quality clearly degrades after the first 12  nods , so only these good quality images were used . for these data , we use a small centroided photometric aperture of 0.5  arcsec that is well - matched to the size of the image .",
    "this small aperture reduces the sky background noise included in the photometric aperture , but requires an aperture correction .",
    "we derive an aperture correction of  1.62 by measuring fluxes from the standard stars with both large and small apertures .",
    "the final ( aperture corrected ) @xmath11 flux for eureka is given in table  [ results ] .",
    "1998  vf@xmath0 is somewhat fainter than eureka , and is not visible in data from a single nod position .",
    "we used all 24  nod positions for this target , double - difference combined into three intermediate images of eight consecutive nod positions each .",
    "this allows us to make three independent measurements of the asteroid s brightness . the final ( aperture corrected ) @xmath11 flux for 1998  vf@xmath0 is given in table  [ results ] .",
    "at @xmath14 , eureka is not visible in the data from individual nods nor easily visible in partial sums of the data . consequently , we combine all the data into a single final double - differenced image .",
    "we used a small aperture of 0.7  arcsec , with an aperture correction of  1.23 ( derived from the standard stars ) .",
    "the final ( aperture corrected ) @xmath14 flux for eureka is given in table  [ results ] .",
    "we did not detect 1998  vf@xmath0 at @xmath14 band and did not detect 2001  fr@xmath1 at @xmath11 band .",
    "( because 2001  fr@xmath1 was not detected at @xmath11 , no measurement of that asteroid at @xmath14 was attempted . ) to determine upper limits on the fluxes for these non - detections , we implanted scaled copies of the @xmath11  1998  vf@xmath0 point source in the 2001  fr@xmath1 @xmath11 image and scaled copies of the @xmath14  eureka point source in the 1998  vf@xmath0 @xmath14 image .",
    "we measure the fluxes for the faintest implanted objects that are detected to set the upper limits for these two observations .",
    "these limits are roughly consistent with three times the sky noise ( table  [ results ] ) , as expected .",
    "eureka is the brightest asteroid source in our program , and we look to it to characterize the errors in our measurements .",
    "we have 12  independent measurements of eureka at @xmath11 .",
    "the scatter in these flux measurements is comparable to the variation in the sky background ( both around 12% ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that , for measurements where we have only few or one flux measurement and hence can not characterize the scatter in the measurements , we can estimate the error in our measurement from the sky variability .",
    "we use this technique for both the 1998  vf@xmath0 @xmath11 and eureka @xmath14 measurements .",
    "we convert michelle counts to flux density units ( mjy ) by using the photometric calibrator stars ( table  [ results ] ) .",
    "we combine the measurements from all the calibrator stars to define a single calibration factor for each bandpass because the matches in time and sky location between calibration stars and asteroids are not very good . at  @xmath11 ,",
    "the calibration factor is uncertain at the 5% level , as estimated from the scatter among the calibration factors from the three standard star measurements ; at  @xmath14 , the uncertainty , derived the same way , is around 10% .",
    "we add these errors in quadrature with the errors in our measurements to derive the final errors reported in table  [ results ] .",
    "our targets have temperatures around 250  k ( as calculated in our thermal modeling , described below ) .",
    "thus , color corrections can be important , as these asteroids are substantially colder than the calibrator stars ( @xmath174000  k ) .",
    "the isophotal wavelengths ( wavelength at which the flux density from the object s spectrum equals the average flux density calculated by integrating over the filter profile ) for ceres ( 217  k ) in michelle @xmath11 and @xmath14 are 11.52  microns and 18.26  microns , respectively ( k. volk , priv .  comm . ) .",
    "we adopt these ceres isophotal wavelengths for our observed asteroids as our derived temperatures are quite close to the ceres temperature used .",
    "we use these isophotal wavelengths in our thermal models described below , although these shifts from nominal wavelengths are relatively small and , compared to the errors in our measurements , unimportant .",
    "we interpret the observed thermal emission from our targets using the standard thermal model ( stm ; _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) . the stm assumes a non - rotating ( or zero thermal - inertia ) spherical asteroid : dayside temperatures are in equilibrium with sunlight , while the nightside temperature is zero .",
    "@xcite found that the thermal emission from asteroids frequently has a higher color temperature than would nominally be predicted under the stm assumptions given above , and introduced an empirical parameter , @xmath18 , that allowed them to simultaneously model the elevated color temperature of the thermal emission and the ( known ) size of their targets ( ceres and pallas ) .",
    "the canonical value for this beaming parameter @xmath18 is  0.756 , but recent studies ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) find that @xmath18 can be significantly larger .",
    "we rely on jpl s horizons ephemeris service for distance , phase angle , and absolute visual magnitude ( @xmath19 ) information ( table  [ obslog ] , table  [ results ] ) .",
    "we relate diameter , albedo , and @xmath19 through    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the visible geometric albedo and @xmath22 is the diameter in kilometers @xcite .",
    "we use a thermal phase coefficient 0.01  mag / deg .",
    "we assume standard scattering behavior for the surface in the visible , resulting in a phase integral @xmath23 .",
    "our data on eureka allow us to determine the albedo @xmath21 , diameter @xmath22 , and beaming parameter @xmath18 because eureka is strongly detected at both @xmath11 and @xmath14 ( in combination with @xmath19 , this gives three measurements and three unknowns )",
    ". models with @xmath24 give the best fit to the observed @xmath25 color ( figure  [ sedfigure ] ) , but @xmath18 values in the range  0.572.45 are all formally consistent with the data and error bars given in table  [ results ] . using this range of @xmath18",
    ", we derive a diameter for eureka of @xmath26  km .",
    "the corresponding albedo , when the diameter uncertainties and an uncertainty of 0.3  mag for @xmath19 @xcite are included , is @xmath27 , a range of acceptable albedos that is so large as to be nearly useless .",
    "we take two approaches to generating more useful error bars .",
    "our first approach relies on results from other solar system observing programs .",
    "modeling of various solar system observations has shown that the beaming parameter @xmath18 is unlikely to have a value larger than  @xmath171.8 @xcite .",
    "requiring @xmath28 reduces the upper bound on eureka s size and consequently the lower bound on the albedo , giving a diameter of @xmath29  km and an albedo of @xmath30 ( including the uncertainty in @xmath19 ) .",
    "furthermore , eureka s albedo is unlikely to be larger than  0.5 @xcite . which constrains the upper bound of the albedo and the lower bound of the diameter , giving @xmath31  km and and an albedo of @xmath32 .",
    "our second approach simply assigns @xmath24 ( the best fit for @xmath18 ) rather than using a range of @xmath18 values .",
    "this gives a diameter of @xmath33  km and a resulting albedo of 0.39@xmath34 ( with the uncertainty in @xmath19 still included ) .",
    "we take these latter results as our derived best fits ( table  [ results ] ) , but emphasize that diameter and albedo both depend on choice of @xmath18 , whose uncertainty is not captured in the error bars for this best fit , and that alternate assumptions produce different `` best '' results ( as in our first approach ) .",
    "however , we note that in all cases the derived ( and best - fit ) albedo is consistent with the asteroid s s(i )  taxonomic class and interpreted angritic composition @xcite .    drawing upon the success of the stm in fitting the eureka data ,",
    "we apply the stm with @xmath24 to the data for 1998  vf@xmath0 and 2001  fr@xmath1 ; the results are shown in figure  [ sedfigure ] and table  [ results ] .",
    "this extrapolation of the stm to these other two bodies is warranted both because the sizes and temperatures of these three asteroids do not differ significantly , and because the available data for 1998  vf@xmath0 and 2001  fr@xmath1 are so sparse that they do not justify a different model . because we have only a single mid - infrared data point for 1998  vf@xmath0",
    ", we solve for the albedo and diameter ( table  [ results ] ) simply by finding the stm solution that passes through the @xmath11  measurement .",
    "the errors on diameter give the range of solutions that are consistent with the 1@xmath8 photometric error bars ; the albedo uncertainties include both the diameter uncertainty and 0.3  magnitudes uncertainty in @xmath19 . for 2001  fr@xmath1 , we solve for the maximum radius and minimum albedo by finding the stm solution that passes through the @xmath11  upper limit measurement",

    "@xcite show a partial lightcurve for eureka that suggests that eureka s rotation period may be @xmath1710  hours .",
    "this period gives @xmath35 of 1.63.2 ( for the above range of @xmath37 ) , in good agreement with the expected value .",
    "thus , eureka s thermal properties appear to be consistent with theoretical expectations @xcite as well as with the results for similarly - sized near earth objects ( neos ) @xcite .    in the stm , dayside temperature goes as @xmath48 , so @xmath49 results in warmer emission , while @xmath50 results in cooler emission .",
    "relatively cooler dayside temperatures will be produced by a high thermal inertia surface since some of the thermal emission will occur on the nightside .",
    "our result that @xmath18 is greater than unity is therefore consistent with our argument that @xmath37 ( thermal inertia ) is relatively large . both conclusions are consistent with a relative dearth of regolith , as predicted for bodies of this size @xcite , and with the small size we derive ( _ e.g. , _",
    "we note that relatively large @xmath18 could also indicate a relatively smooth surface ( on macroscopic scales ) , which again could imply a relatively thin regolith .",

    ", we conclude that eureka s regolith is likely relatively thin , as predicted for a body this size .",
    "eureka s thermal inertia is likely similar to that for comparably - sized neos .",

    "the albedos we derive are consistent with those taxa and implied compositions .",
    "2001  fr@xmath1 has a diameter ( @xmath2520  m ) comparable to very small neos that have been observed in the mid - infrared ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) and in radar experiments ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite )",
