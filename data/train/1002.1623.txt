    "the six vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions was introduced in @xcite and since then many connections with enumerative combinatorics and orthogonal polynomials theory have been unveiled @xcite .",
    "for instance , the problem of alternating sign matrices ( asm ) and domino tilings enumeration is known to have a close relationship with the six vertex model with this particular boundary condition @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the partition function of this model was also shown to correspond to a schubert polynomial in @xcite and to a kp @xmath0 function in @xcite .    from the physical point of view",
    "the study of the partition function of this model reveals us an interesting phenomena . using the determinant representation found by izergin @xcite and a toda chain differential equation @xcite satisfied by this partition function",
    ", it was shown in @xcite that the bulk free energy of the six vertex model with domain wall boundaries in the thermodynamical limit differs from the one with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this fact has been also discussed in @xcite and raises the issue of the sensitivity of the six vertex model in the thermodynamical limit with boundary conditions .",
    "domain wall boundary conditions were first introduced and studied within the scope of the quantum inverse scattering method @xcite , and they emerge naturally in the calculation of correlations functions of quantum integrable systems @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "integrable systems with an underlying yang - baxter symmetry have also been tackled by functional equations methods , which are intimately connected with baxter s commuting transfer matrix approach @xcite . however , since functional methods usually do not provide the eigenvectors of the system , it is usually claimed that the calculation of correlation functions is out of reach for functional equations methods .",
    "the use of the yang - baxter algebra in order to obtain functional equations was first introduced in @xcite and the aim of this paper is to show that the yang - baxter equation can still be explored in order to obtain a functional relation for the partition function of the six vertex model with domain wall boundaries .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the section 2",
    "we describe the six vertex model with domain wall boundaries and its construction in terms of the yang - baxter algebra elements . in the section 3",
    "we derive a functional equation determining the partition function of the model and in section 4 and 5 we study its homogeneous limit and some particular solutions .",
    "concluding remarks and open questions are discussed in the section 6 and in the appendix a and b we present some extra results and technical details .",
    "vertex models in statistical mechanics were first introduced by l. pauling aiming to describe the residual entropy of ice @xcite .",
    "these models are described in terms of a matrix @xmath1 containing the statistical weights of the possible vertex configurations .    in a two dimensional rectangular lattice consisting of @xmath2 horizontal and @xmath3 vertical lines we have @xmath4 intersection points and the intersection point of the @xmath5-th horizontal and the @xmath6-th vertical line together with the four connecting edges",
    "is referred as a vertex , as represented in the fig .",

    "( b ) the vertex at position @xmath7 with its corresponding statistical weight.,width=612 ]    the edge variables @xmath8 characterizes the configuration of the vertex at position @xmath7 while @xmath9 denotes its statistical weight .",
    "the partition function of the model is thus obtained by summing the product of the statistical weights over all possible configurations , i.e. @xmath10 for a more detailed discussion about vertex models and their applications in statistical mechanics see for instance @xcite and references therein .    in order to evaluate the sum ( [ zsum ] ) it is usually assumed a particular boundary condition and the concept of domain wall boundary conditions for the inhomogeneous six vertex model was introduced by korepin in the ref .",
    "@xcite . turning our attention to the six vertex model , each edge variable @xmath11 and @xmath12 can assume two possible configurations under a certain restriction known as ice rule .",
    "these assumptions result in the following @xmath1-matrix @xmath13 containing the statistical weights @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 of the allowed configurations .",
    "the weights are explicitly given by @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the anisotropy parameter and the complex variable @xmath21 parametrizes the yang - baxter integrable manifold @xmath22 strictly speaking , the @xmath1-matrix ( [ lm ] ) satisfies the yang - baxter relation @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "consequently , the monodromy matrix @xmath26 satisfies the relation @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the standard permutation matrix .",
    "the relation ( [ rtt ] ) is commonly referred as yang - baxter algebra and , together with the relation ( [ yb ] ) , they constitute the basis of the quantum inverse scattering method @xcite .",
    "boundary conditions are an important ingredient in the formulation of lattice models and the case with domain wall boundary conditions introduced in @xcite requires that the boundary edges have a particular configuration respecting the six vertex model symmetry . for",
    "the six vertex model each edge variable @xmath30 can assume two possible configurations which can be conveniently denoted by arrows pointing inwards or outwards , i.e. @xmath31 in this way domain wall boundary conditions consist of the restrictions @xmath32 where now we are considering a square lattice with @xmath33 . in order to make this situation more clear and intuitive , we have depicted a possible six vertex lattice configuration with domain wall boundaries in the fig .",
    "2 .        for the six vertex model the monodromy matrix ( [ mono ] )",
    "consist of a @xmath34 matrix with operator valued entries . within the framework of the quantum inverse scattering method",
    "it can be conveniently denoted as @xmath35 and it was shown in @xcite that the partition function ( [ zsum ] ) of the inhomogeneous six vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions can be written as @xmath36 or equivalently @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote the usual ferromagnetic states @xmath40 in the next sections we shall demonstrate how the yang - baxter algebra can be employed in order to obtain a functional relation for the partition function ( [ pf ] ) .",
    "the yang - baxter algebra is a corner stone of the quantum inverse scattering method and it has been successfully explored in order to construct integrable systems and to extract exact results from them .",
    "more recently , it was shown in @xcite that the yang - baxter algebra can also render functional relations determining the spectrum of spin chains with non - diagonal twisted and open boundary conditions .    in the ref .",
    "@xcite korepin obtained a recursion relation for the partition function ( [ pf ] ) whose solution was later on given by izergin @xcite in terms of a determinant formula .",
    "our purpose here is to demonstrate that the yang - baxter algebra also provide us a functional equation determining the partition function of the six vertex model with domain wall boundaries . in order to do",
    "so we first need to recall some properties exhibited by the six vertex model monodromy matrix ( [ mono ] ) .",
    "let @xmath41 and @xmath42 be the states @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively , acting on the @xmath6-th space of the tensor product @xmath45 .",
    "the action of @xmath46 on these states yields us a triangular matrix .",
    "for instance we have @xmath47 and analogously @xmath48 where the symbol @xmath49 stands for a non - null value .",
    "due to its definition , the monodromy matrix ( [ mono ] ) inherits the triangular properties ( [ t1 ] ) and ( [ t2 ] ) . in this way",
    "the monodromy matrix elements satisfy the relations @xmath50 and @xmath51    another fundamental ingredient in the method considered here is the yang - baxter algebra .",
    "the relation ( [ rtt ] ) encodes several commutation rules for the elements of the monodromy matrix and among them we shall make use of the following ones @xmath52 & = & \\frac{c(\\lambda - \\nu)}{b(\\lambda - \\nu ) } \\left [ a(\\nu , \\ { \\mu_k \\ } ) d(\\lambda , \\ { \\mu_k \\ } ) - a(\\lambda , \\ { \\mu_k \\ } ) d(\\nu , \\",

    "furthermore , it was also demonstrated in @xcite that @xmath55 with @xmath56 @xmath57 for any number @xmath58 of operators @xmath59 .",
    "the demonstration of ( [ cbb])-([mn1 ] ) only makes use of the commutation rules ( [ abc ] ) together with the relations ( [ action ] ) .    at this stage",
    "we have gathered most of the ingredients required to obtain a functional relation for the partition function ( [ pf ] ) . in order to proceed",
    "we look to the relation ( [ cbb ] ) with @xmath60 and act with the dual vector @xmath61 on its left hand side . by doing",
    "so we obtain the following relation @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the partition function ( [ pf ] ) omitting the dependence with the variables @xmath64 .",
    "we shall refer to @xmath65 as bethe vectors and it was also shown in @xcite that @xmath66 which implies in @xmath67 due to the relations ( [ actionb ] ) .",
    "the bethe vectors enjoy the property of being highest weight @xmath68 vectors @xcite and a careful examination of ( [ cblz ] ) , taking into account the relation ( [ z0 ] ) , reveals that its left hand side vanishes . in other words , the consistency of the yang - baxter algebra with the highest weight property of the bethe vectors results in the following functional equation for ( [ pf ] ) , @xmath69 where the functions @xmath70 and @xmath71 are given by the relations ( [ mn ] ) and ( [ mn1 ] ) with @xmath60",
    "we have verified the validity of the relation ( [ fz ] ) by explicit computing the partition function @xmath72 for @xmath73 using the definition ( [ pf ] ) , and in what follows we shall discuss the properties of the eq .",
    "( [ fz ] ) as well as some particular solutions .",
    "the results of the previous sections focus on an inhomogeneous lattice whose statistical weights are parametrized by variables @xmath74 and @xmath64 . in this section",
    "we analyze explicitly the homogeneous limit @xmath75 in the eq .",
    "( [ fz ] ) for @xmath76 which already unveils the properties that uniquely determine the partition function ( [ pf ] ) .",
    "the case @xmath77 is trivial since the partition function @xmath78 can be promptly written down from the definitions ( [ lm ] ) , ( [ mono ] ) and ( [ pf ] ) .",
    "however it is worthwhile to look at ( [ fz ] ) with @xmath77 for illustrative purposes . in that case",
    "we have the equation @xmath79 and by inspecting the relations ( [ mn ] ) and ( [ mn1 ] ) we find in general that the limit @xmath80 can be easily obtained . by way of contrast",
    "the limit @xmath81 is highly non - trivial due to the presence of poles in the functions @xmath70 and @xmath71 when two variables @xmath82 coincide . in spite of that",
    ", this limit can be taken using lhopital s rule and we shall see that the polynomial structure and the asymptotic behavior discussed in the appendix a also plays an important role in the unique determination of the the partition function @xmath72",
    ".    considering the limits @xmath83 and @xmath84 in the eq .",

    "however , the polynomial structure discussed in the appendix a requires that @xmath91 and we are thus left with @xmath92 .",
    "the constant @xmath89 is then fixed by the asymptotic behavior , see appendix a , and for @xmath77 we end up with @xmath93 as mentioned before , the case @xmath77 is a trivial case and we now turn our attention to the case @xmath94 . in that case",
    "( [ fz ] ) reads @xmath95 and again we can use lhopital s rule in order to evaluate the limit @xmath96 and @xmath97 . in terms of the variables @xmath98 , we have that @xmath99 where the function @xmath100 is a polynomial of degree @xmath101 in each variable separately as discussed in the appendix a. thus , in the homogeneous limit , the function @xmath102 is a polynomial of order @xmath103 in the variable @xmath104 .",
    "this fact implies in @xmath105 for @xmath106 and taking this into account , when considering the homogeneous limit in ( [ l2 ] ) , we obtain the equation @xmath107 where @xmath108    looking to the polynomial solution of ( [ ed2 ] ) , we can generically write @xmath109 where @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 are arbitrary constants . in this way by replacing ( [ anz ] ) into ( [ ed2 ] ) we find @xmath113 and the constant @xmath112 is then fixed by the asymptotic behavior of @xmath102 which can be found in the appendix a. it turns out that @xmath114 and we close this section summarizing our results .",
    "although we have considered only solutions in the homogeneous limit , this analysis suggests that the partition function @xmath115 is determined by the following properties :    a.   functional relation ( [ fz ] ) ; b.   polynomial structure : @xmath116 where @xmath117 is a polynomial of degree @xmath118 in each variable @xmath119 separately ; c.   asymptotic behavior @xmath120_{q^2 } ! \\ ; ( x_{1 } \\dots x_{l})^{l-1 } $ ] as @xmath121 .",

    "$ ] corresponds to the @xmath123-factorial function whose definition is given in the appendix a , and in the next section we shall discuss the validity of the properties ( i)-(iii ) for the non - homogeneous case .",
    "in order to analyze the role of the conditions ( i)-(iii ) given in the previous section we shall now consider the case with @xmath124 , while @xmath125 are kept arbitrary , in addition to the homogeneous limit discussed previously .",
    "let us start again looking to the case @xmath77 where the partition function @xmath126 is constrained by the eq .",
    "( [ l1 ] ) . in that case the polynomial structure ( ii ) implies that @xmath126 is a constant and it solves the eq .",
    "( [ l1 ] ) due to the identity @xmath127 which holds even when @xmath128 is kept arbitrary . that constant",
    "is then determined by the property ( iii ) similarly to the homogeneous case discussed in the previous section .    for the case @xmath94 , the partition function",
    "@xmath129 satisfies the eq .",
    "( [ l2 ] ) and the polynomial structure ( ii ) implies in the following general form for the partition function , @xmath130 where @xmath131 are arbitrary coefficients . by replacing the expression ( [ pol12 ] ) in the eq .",
    "( [ l2 ] ) and equating the coefficients we find constraints for @xmath131 which are solved by @xmath132 while the leading term coefficient @xmath133 is then determined by the condition ( iii ) , @xmath134    the fact that the eq .",
    "( [ fz ] ) determines all coefficients of the polynomial @xmath135 , except for one , would be expected since the eq .",
    "( [ fz ] ) is invariant under the transformation @xmath136 where @xmath137 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "thus the role of the condition ( iii ) is the determination of the leading term coefficient of the polynomial @xmath135 .",
    "the partition function @xmath129 is also expected to be symmetric in the variables @xmath138 and @xmath139 , i.e. @xmath140 , due to the definition ( [ pf ] ) and the commutation relations ( [ abc ] ) . though we have not made this assumption , the solution of the eq .",

    "( [ mn ] ) and ( [ mn1 ] ) . restricting ourselves to the polynomial solution of ( [ l3 ] ) characterized by the property ( ii ) , the partition function @xmath143 can be generically written as @xmath144 which can be directly substituted in the eq .",
    "( [ l3 ] ) . by doing",
    "so we find constraints fixing all the coefficients @xmath145 except for one , i.e. the leading term coefficient @xmath146 , which is then fixed by the property ( iii ) @xmath147 in order to avoid an overcrowded section we have collected in the appendix b the non - null coefficients @xmath145 contained in the expression ( [ pol123 ] ) . as we also observed for the case @xmath94 , the resulting expression ( [ pol123 ] ) is symmetric under the exchange of variables as a direct consequence of the eq .",
    "( [ fz ] ) .",
    "we close this section remarking that although we have not rigorously proved that the conditions ( i)-(iii ) uniquely defines the partition function ( [ pf ] ) , the explicit computations performed in this section and in the previous one , using solely the properties ( i)-(iii ) , strongly suggests that those properties completely determines the partition function @xmath115 .",
    "in this paper we have obtained a functional equation for the partition function of the six vertex model with domain wall boundary condition .",
    "the main ingredient in our derivation is the yang - baxter algebra pointing out a novel branch of exploration of this algebra .",
    "although we have explicitly verified the validity of the functional equation ( [ fz ] ) for @xmath73 , it would be still interesting to provide a proof of the izergin determinant representation @xcite .",
    "it is also worthwhile to remark that functional equations for this partition function have already been presented in the literature @xcite when the anisotropy parameter @xmath123 is a root of unity .",
    "( [ fz ] ) is valid for general values of the anisotropy parameter @xmath123 and certainly it would be interesting to investigate the connections between our equation and the ones of @xcite .",

    "( [ fz ] ) still allows one to investigate alternative representations .    a careful examination of eq . ( [ fz ] ) , or the particular case depicted in ( [ l2 ] ) , suggests that we have a relation between the partition function in the complete homogeneous limit and the one in the partial homogeneous limit .",
    "this partial homogeneous limit has been discussed in @xcite associated to the proof of the refined alternating sign matrix conjecture , and in @xcite related to the six vertex model artic curve .",
    "the examination of ( [ fz ] ) then suggests that such an equation relating partial and complete homogeneous limit could be obtained by considering @xmath148 while keeping @xmath149 fixed .    within the framework of the quantum inverse scattering method ,",
    "the study of partition functions with domain wall boundary conditions shares many aspects with the computation of scalar products and correlation functions @xcite . given this similarity we hope to report on functional equations for scalar products and correlation functions in a future publication .",
