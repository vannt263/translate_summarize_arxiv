    "since the discovery of superconductivity in lafeas(o@xmath3f@xmath4 ) @xcite , high transition temperatures ( @xmath9 ) up to 56  k have been reported in the doped fe - based oxypnictides @xcite .",
    "the new high - temperature superconductivity in fe - pnictides has attracted tremendous interests both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the ` mother ' materials have antiferromagnetic spin - density - wave order @xcite and the superconductivity appears by doping charge carriers , either electrons or holes . such carrier doping induced superconductivity resembles high-@xmath9 cuprates , but one of the most significant differences is the multiband electronic structure having electron and hole pockets in the fe - based superconductors .",
    "the nature of superconductivity and the pairing mechanism in such systems are fundamental physical problem of crucial importance .",
    "the first experimental task to this problem is to elucidate the superconducting pairing symmetry , which is intimately related to the pairing interaction .",
    "unconventional superconducting pairings , most notably the sign - reversing @xmath10 state , have been suggested by several theories @xcite featuring the importance of the nesting between the hole and electron bands .",
    "this is also in sharp contrast to other multiband superconductors such as mgb@xmath5 , where the coupling between the different bands is very weak .",
    "thus the most crucial is to clarify the novel multiband nature of superconductivity in this new class of materials .    in this context , identifying the detailed structure of superconducting order parameter , particularly the presence or absence of nodes in the gap function , is of primary importance . in the electron - doped @xmath11feas(o , f ) or ` 1111 ' systems ( where @xmath11 is lanthanoide ions ) , while several experiments @xcite suggest nodes in the gap , the tunnelling measurements @xcite and angle resolved photoemission ( arpes ) @xcite suggest fully gapped superconductivity . in the hole - doped ba@xmath3k@xmath4fe@xmath5as@xmath5 or",
    "` 122 ' system @xcite , experimental situation is controversial as well : arpes @xcite and lower critical field measurements @xcite support nodeless gaps while @xmath12sr measurements @xcite imply the presence of line nodes in the gap function .",
    "one of the effective ways to judge the presence or absence of nodes in the gap is to investigate the properties of thermally excited quasiparticles at low temperatures .",
    "measurements of the london penetration depth @xmath13 are most suited for this , since the quasiparticle density is directly related to @xmath14 . in @xmath15-wave superconductors with line nodes , for example ,",
    "the low - temperature change in the penetration depth @xmath16 shows a linear temperature dependence , as observed in high-@xmath9 cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "in contrast , fully gapped superconductors without nodes exhibit an exponential temperature dependence of @xmath17 , reflecting the thermally activated behavior of quasiparticles . also notable",
    "is that the penetration depth is typically hundreds of nm , much longer than lattice parameters , which enables us to discuss the bulk properties of fe - based superconductors .",
    "this contrasts with other surface sensitive techniques such as arpes and scanning tunneling spectroscopy .",
    "another important means to clarify not only the superconducting gap symmetry , but also the multiband nature of superconductivity is an accurate determination of the lower critical field @xmath8 . in particular , the two - gap superconductivity in mgb@xmath5 manifests itself in the unusual temperature dependence of the anisotropy of @xmath8 in the superconducting state @xcite . however , the reliable measurement of the lower critical field is a difficult task , in particular when strong vortex pinning is present as in the case of fe - arsenides .",
    "we also point out that to date the reported values of anisotropy parameter strongly vary @xcite spanning from 1.2 ( ref .  ) up to @xmath18 ( ref .  ) in 1111 systems .",
    "although the anisotropy parameter may be different for different compounds , this apparent large spread may be partly due to the effects of strong vortex pinning , which lead to large ambiguity in some experiments .",
    "here we review our microwave surface impedance @xmath19 measurements in single crystals of electron - doped prfeaso@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) @xcite and hole - doped ba@xmath3k@xmath4fe@xmath5as@xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) @xcite . by using a sensitive superconducting cavity resonator , we can measure both real and imaginary parts of @xmath19 pricesely in tiny single crystals , from which we can extract the in - plane penetration depth @xmath20 as well as quasiparticle conductivity @xmath21 that yields information on the quasiparticle dynamics .",
    "we also measure @xmath22 in prfeaso@xmath1 crystals by using an unambiguous method to avoid the difficulty associated with pinning @xcite .",
    "we directly determine the field @xmath23 at which first flux penetration occurs from the edge of the crystal by measuring the magnetic induction just inside and outside the edge of the single crystals , with the use of a miniature hall - sensor array .",
    "this allows us to extract the temperature dependent values of the lower critical fields parallel to the @xmath24-axis ( @xmath25 ) and to the @xmath26-plane ( @xmath27 ) , as well as the anisotropy parameter @xmath28 in single crystals of fe - based superconductors .    the penetration depth in ba@xmath3k@xmath4fe@xmath5as@xmath5",
    "is found to be sensitive to disorder inherent in the crystals .",
    "the source of disorder may be microscopic inhomogeneous content of k , which is reactive with moisture or oxygen .",
    "the degree of disorder can be quantified by the quasiparticle scattering rate @xmath29 .",
    "we find that @xmath20 in crystals with large scattering rate shows strong temperature dependence which mimics that of superconductors with nodes in the gap . in the best crystal with the smallest @xmath29",
    ", however , @xmath20 shows clear flattening at low temperatures , giving strong evidence for the nodeless superconductivity .",
    "@xmath20 in prfeaso@xmath1 also shows flat temperature dependence at low temperatures .",
    "the superfluid density can be consistently explained by the presence of two fully - opened gaps in both hole- and electron - doped systems .",
    "the lower critical field measurements consistently give the saturation behavior of superfluid density at low temperatures .",
    "we find that the anisotropy of the penetration depths @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath0 are out - of - plane and in - plane penetration depths , respectively , is smaller than the anisotropy of the coherence lengths @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are in- and out - of - plane coherence lengths , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the upper critical fields parallel and perpendicular to the @xmath26-plane , respectively .",
    "this result provides further evidence for the multiband nature of the superconductivity .",
    "finally , the quasiparticle conductivity exhibits a large enhancement in the superconducting state , which bears a similarity with high-@xmath9 cuprates and heavy fermion superconductors with strong electron scattering in the normal state above @xmath9 .",

    "the starting materials were mixed at nominal compositions of prfeaso@xmath39 and ground in an agate mortar in a glove box filled with dry nitrogen gas .",

    "<S> in this article , we review our recent studies of microwave penetration depth , lower critical fields , and quasiparticle conductivity in the superconducting state of fe - arsenide superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> high - sensitivity microwave surface impedance measurements of the in - plane penetration depth @xmath0 in single crystals of electron - doped prfeaso@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) and hole - doped ba@xmath3k@xmath4fe@xmath5as@xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) are presented . in clean crystals of ba@xmath3k@xmath4fe@xmath5as@xmath5 , as well as in prfeaso@xmath1 crystals , </S>",
    "<S> the penetration depth shows flat temperature dependence at low temperatures , indicating that the superconducting gap opens all over the fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of superfluid density @xmath7 in both systems is most consistent with the existence of two different gaps . in ba@xmath3k@xmath4fe@xmath5as@xmath5 , we find that the superfluid density is sensitive to degrees of disorder inherent in the crystals , implying unconventional impurity effect . </S>",
    "<S> we also determine the lower critical field @xmath8 in prfeaso@xmath1 by using an array of micro - hall probes . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of @xmath8 saturates at low temperatures , fully consistent with the superfluid density determined by microwave measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy of @xmath8 has a weak temperature dependence with smaller values than the anisotropy of upper critical fields at low temperatures , which further supports the multi - gap superconductivity in fe - arsenide systems . </S>",
    "<S> the quasiparticle conductivity shows an enhancement in the superconducting state , which suggests the reduction of quasiparticle scattering rate due to the gap formation below @xmath9 . from these results , we discuss the structure of the superconducting gap in these fe - arsenides , in comparison with the high-@xmath9 cuprate superconductors .    </S>",
