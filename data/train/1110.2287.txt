    "the anderson model was proposed first to explain the absence of electronic diffusion in certain random lattices @xcite and later to explain the absence of diffusion of light in certain amorphous materials @xcite . in the first case ,",
    "the electron energy is lower than the maxima of the lattice potential and the particles diffuse by tunnelling . in the second case the particles ( photons in @xcite )",
    "energy is higher than the potential and the particles are `` free '' . in both cases , in the absence of disorder , the eigenstates are delocalized states ( bloch waves in the first regime , plane waves in the second ) .",
    "the presence of a @xmath0-correlated random potential freezes the wave propagation at a length of @xmath1 , the localization length , always in one ( 1d ) and two dimension ( 2d ) , and depending on the disorder strength and the energy wave also in three dimension ( 3d ) @xcite . in the last few years",
    "the ultracold atom community has devoted a large effort to the experimental realization of anderson localization .",
    "anderson localization in the tight - binding regime was observed in momentum space with kicked - rotor set - ups , in 1d @xcite , and 3d @xcite , and in real space by using a quasi - periodic potential ( thus not strictly - speaking a random potential ) .",
    "the key - ingredient for the experimental study of anderson localization of ultracold atoms in the `` free''-particle regime has been the speckle potential @xcite . by using this handable optical potential ,",
    "anderson localization was observed in 1d @xcite and in 3d @xcite , and anomalous diffusion was observed in 2d @xcite .",
    "the auto - correlation function of the speckle potential is a square - sinc , thus it decays algebraically as a long - range correlated disorder , but is also characterized by a finite size correlation length @xmath2 , corresponding to the width of central bump of the square - sinc function .    in 1d",
    ", the presence of disorder patterns with auto - correlation functions decaying algebraically can mimic the presence of a mobility edge @xcite and can even enhance localization , as shown in a microwave experiment @xcite .",
    "both phenomena are due to the fact that the disorder spectrum is non - zero in a finite momentum interval .",
    "very recently semmler and coworkers @xcite have studied the phase diagram of correlated fermions in 2d and 3d optical lattices and in the presence of a speckle potential . from the analysis of the local density of states",
    "( dos ) they identify an anderson - mott and a mott localized phase as functions of the interaction strength and the strength of the speckle potential . in this article",
    "we analyze the possibility of observing anderson localization of a non - interacting wave , for example a non - interacting bose - einstein condensate @xcite , in a speckle potential _ superposed _ to a 1d lattice potential . by using a decimation / renormalization scheme",
    "@xcite we analyze how the dos of a lattice is modified by the presence of the speckle , and we estimate the localization length @xmath1 as function of the disorder strength and of the width @xmath2 of the auto - correlation function . the speckle potential is introduced as an on - site disorder which has statistical properties which are the same as a genuine speckle potential .",

    "these results can be a guide to choosing the experimental parameters to observe anderson localization in the tight binding regime with speckle disordered patterns .",
    "to study the effect of a speckle potential in the presence of a 1d lattice on matter - wave transport we use the 1d tight - binding ( tb ) hamiltonian , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the number of sites , @xmath5 the energy at the site @xmath6 .",
    "the hopping term @xmath7 is chosen site - independent .",
    "the effect of the speckle potential is introduced in the on - site energy distribution by setting @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the fluctuation of @xmath5 with respect to the mean value @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the disorder strength and @xmath2 the width , in the units of the lattice step @xmath12 , of the correlation function in eq .",

    "first we generate a sequence of @xmath16 @xmath0-correlated random numbers @xmath17 , with @xmath18 from a uniform distribution centered in zero and of width 1 .",

    ", the localization length at the center of the spectrum , @xmath51 , is quite large , of the order of 50 lattice sites . by increasing the strength of the disorder ,",
    "@xmath51 decreases significantly only for small values of the correlation length ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) , and @xmath46 becomes almost energy - independent in the whole band .",
    "longer - range correlations ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) act instead more efficiently on the edge states . to better understand these reasults",

    "there is a @xmath60 symmetry in the dos due to the presence of the underlying lattice and correlations act symmetrically with respect to the center of the spectrum , the observation ( ii ) leads to the conclusion that , if one wants to experimentally observe anderson localization in the whole low - energy band , @xmath61 should be greater than @xmath62 , thus @xmath2 should be lower than @xmath63 lattice steps .",
