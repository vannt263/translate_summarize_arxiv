    "cosmic structure formation has redistributed the baryons from a nearly uniformly distributed plasma into a variety of states , including stars , stellar remnants , cold ( atomic and molecular ) gas , and hot ( ionized ) gas .",
    "the theories of galaxy formation can predict the amount of mass in these different states , which can in turn be tested by observational constraints .    on cosmological scales ,",
    "the ratio between the total baryonic and gravitating mass is measured to be @xmath14 ( the planck collaboration 2014 )",
    ". however , the cold baryonic mass density implied by several galaxy baryon estimates is only 3 - 8% of the big bang nucleosynthesis expection @xcite . the majority of the cosmic baryons are thought to be in the form of hot gas around or between galaxies @xcite . until recently only a fraction of these baryons had been detected @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy is referred to as the `` missing baryon problem '' .",
    "recent advances in the detection of gas in the circum galactic medium ( cgm ) have come from the cos survey @xcite . on the scale of milky way mass haloes @xmath15 a significant amount of warm",
    "( @xmath16k ) gas has been detected @xcite , accounting for 33 - 88% of the baryon budget . in the future such observations",
    "will be extended to a wider range of halo masses .    in this paper",
    "we make predictions for the baryonic budget for stars , cold , warm and hot gas in and around the virial radius of haloes of mass ranging from @xmath10 to @xmath17 .",
    "we use a sample of 88 zoom - in galaxy formation simulations from the nihao project .",
    "nihao galaxies are consistent with the stellar mass vs halo mass relations from halo abundance matching since redshift @xmath18 @xcite , the galaxy star formation rate vs stellar mass relation since @xmath18 @xcite , and the cold gas mass vs stellar mass relation at @xmath19 ( stinson 2015 ) .",
    "therefore , the simulations make plausible predictions for the mass fractions and physical locations of the warm and hot gas components . we find that all the haloes contain less baryons than expected according to the cosmic baryonic fraction , but the missing fraction is strongly mass dependent .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the cosmological hydrodynamical simulations including star formation and feedback are briefly described in  [ sec : sims ] ; in  [ sec : budget ] we present the results including the baryonic budget , baryon distribution , and a comparison with observations ;  [ sec : sum ] gives a summary of our results .",
    "in this study we use simulations from the nihao ( numerical investigation of a hundred astrophysical objects ) project @xcite .",
    "the initial conditions are created to keep the same numerical resolution across the whole mass range with typically a million dark matter particles inside the virial radius of the target halo at redshift @xmath20 .",
    "the halos to be re - simulated at higher resolution with baryons have been extracted from 3 different pure n - body simulations with a box size of 60 , 20 and 15 @xmath21 mpc respectively .",
    "we adopted the latest compilation of cosmological parameters from the planck satellite @xcite .",
    "more information on the collisionless parent simulations and sample selection can be found in @xcite and @xcite    we use the sph hydrodynamics code gasoline @xcite , with a revised treatment of hydrodynamics as described in @xcite .",
    "the code includes a subgrid model for turbulent mixing of metal and energy @xcite , heating and cooling include photoelectric heating of dust grains , ultraviolet ( uv ) heating and ionization and cooling due to hydrogen , helium and metals @xcite .",
    "the star formation and feedback modeling follows what was used in the magicc simulations @xcite .",
    "there are two small changes in nihao simulations : the change in number of neighbors and the new combination of softening length and particle mass increases the threshold for star formation from 9.3 to 10.3 @xmath22 , the increase of pre - sn feedback efficiency @xmath23 , from 0.1 to 0.13 .",
    "the more detail on star formation and feedback modeling can be found in @xcite .",
    "we define the fiducial baryonic mass as : @xmath24 where the @xmath25 is the total dark matter mass in the halo , and the @xmath26 is the cosmic baryon fraction ( the ratio between baryon density and mass density including baryonic mass plus dark matter ) , so that the @xmath27 is the baryonic mass inside the virial radius if the baryons follow the dark matter closely .",
    "[ fig : budget ] shows the ratio between the mass of each baryon component inside the virial radius to the fiducial baryonic mass for the most massive galaxy in each zoom - in region .",
    "we present the fractions of total stellar mass ( blue points ) , and the total baryonic mass including stellar mass plus gas mass ( green points ) . for the stellar mass fraction",
    "we also show the relations from the halo abundance matching @xcite .",
    "the grey area is the one sigma scatter around the mean value from @xcite .",
    "we tried to capture the behaviour of the baryonic mass fraction as a function of the halo mass using a double power law formula : @xmath28                           \\right\\}^{\\frac{\\beta-\\alpha}{\\gamma}}.\\ ] ] in this formula , the lower and higher mass ends have logarithmic slope @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , while @xmath31 regulates how sharp the transition is from the lower to the higher ends .",
    "the best fit parameters are as follows : @xmath32 the green shaded region indicates the scatter about the best fit line .",
    "these are measured in four different mass ranges , and are summarized in table .",
    "[ tab : sigma ] .",
    ".scatters for best fit parameters for the total baryonic mass fraction computed inside one virial radius , @xmath7 , as a function of halo mass @xmath33 in different mass ranges . [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : sigma ]    the trends of each component fraction are similar , in that the fractions are relatively low in low mass haloes , and increase as the halo mass increases .",
    "the main difference between the different components is the slope , with the baryonic mass fraction having a shallower slope than the stellar mass fraction .",
    "this is because in low mass haloes ( @xmath10 ) most of the baryons are in the form of gas , while in the highest mass haloes we study ( @xmath34 ) there are roughly equal amounts of stars and gas .",
    "[ fig : budget ] shows that all haloes in our study contain less than the universal fraction of baryons .",
    "the upper panel uses a linear y - axis scale , which highlights the large amount of baryons that are missing , especially in low mass haloes .",
    "the logarithmic scale in the lower panel highlights the power - law nature of the relatons .",
    "since the haloes we study are above the mass where the cosmic uv background prevents gas from cooling , the missing baryons have most likely been ejected from the central galaxies in supernova / stellar feedback driven winds .",
    "although the lower mass galaxies have converted a smaller fraction of their available baryons into stars , and hence there is proportionally less energy available to drive an outflow , they have expelled a larger fraction of their baryons , consistent with expectations from energy driven gas outflows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "[ fig : rps ] shows the mass ratio profiles of total baryons for each simulation . here",
    "the y - axis is the ratio between the baryonic to dark matter mass , @xmath35 , enclosed within a sphere of radius , @xmath36 , normalized by the cosmic baryon - to - dark matter ratio , @xmath37 .",
    "each solid curve represents a halo , and the curves are colored by their halo mass ( red for high masses to blue for low masses ) . broadly speaking",
    ", the curves have a similar shape , with a normalization that depends on halo mass .",
    "they have a cusp in the central region where the stars and cold gas dominate , then become flat in the outer region .",
    "more massive haloes have higher baryon fractions at all radii . at small radii ,",
    "the baryon to dark matter ratio is higher than the cosmic value due to gas dissipation . even beyond the virial radius ,",
    "there is little change in the baryon fraction up to 2 virial radii .",
    "we thus conclude that the missing baryons are well outside of the virial radius .",
    "ccccc    [ tab : comperison ]      since the cgm is too diffuse to create emission lines , it must be observed using quasar absorption lines .",
    "the cos - halos survey is filling in details about the @xmath38 cgm @xcite .",
    "for the cgm of low - redshift @xmath39 galaxies , @xcite and @xcite constrain the mass of the warm - hot cgm ( @xmath40 ) , @xcite provides a strict lower limit to the mass of cool material ( @xmath41 ) in the cgm of these galaxies . in a study using x - rays , @xcite place a constraints on the mass of hot gas ( @xmath42 ) residing in the extended hot halos .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] , we show the mean values and standard deviation of the mass fraction of stars and different components of gas in our most massive galaxies ( @xmath43 @xmath44 m@xmath45 @xmath44 @xmath46 ) with blue points and error bars . the gas is assigned to a range of temperature bins : cold gas ( t @xmath47 k ) , cool gas ( @xmath48 k @xmath44 t @xmath49 k ) , warm gas ( @xmath50 k @xmath44 t @xmath51 k ) and hot gas ( t @xmath52 k ) .",
    "the observational constraints are shown with the same colour scheme in fig .",
    "11 in @xcite .    in this plot @xcite provides observational constraints for cgm gas mass that are shown as the shaded bars .",
    "the stellar mass range comes from halo abundance matching as described in @xcite .",
    "the cold disk gas mass comes from from @xcite .",
    "the observations and the simulations match well in every phase outside of the cool cgm gas , where the observations find @xmath53 the mass that simulations predict .",
    "if the observations are correct , the simulations have either ejected too far gas that could be cool , or they have created a cgm with the wrong mix of gas temperatures . the total gas fractions ( 0.39 in cos - halos , 0.41 in nihao ) suggest the latter option .",
    "as the cgm of lower mass galaxies will soon be observed , table  [ tab : comperison ] lists information about cgm mass fractions of the different components of gas in haloes down to a halo mass of @xmath54 .",
    "we have used the nihao galaxy simulation suite @xcite to study the statistical features of the baryonic budget and distribution spanning halo masses of @xmath55 to @xmath56 .",
    "nihao is a large ( currently 88 ) set of high resolution cosmological hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulations .",
    "as shown in previous papers the nihao galaxies reproduce several key observed scaling relations .",
    "we summarize our results as follows :    * all of the nihao haloes have a lower baryon to dark matter ratio , inside the viriral radius , than the cosmic baryon fraction .",
    "* the missing baryons in all haloes are beyond 2 virial radii .",
    "* lower mass haloes have lost a larger fraction of their baryons , even though they convert a lower fraction of the baryons into stars .",
    "* for the highest mass haloes in our study @xmath56 our simulations are consistent with the observed fractions of stars , cold gas , warm and hot gas .",
    "however , we underpredict the cool ( @xmath57 ) gas with @xmath58 vs 0.28 - 0.48 observed .",
    "* this discrepancy may indicate that our feedback model pushes the gas too far , or puts gas in the wrong phases , and can be resolved with future observations .",
    "since we match the overall gas fraction we think that there might be some problem in mixing the gas temperature .",
