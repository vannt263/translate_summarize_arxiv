    "its experimental error is the main obstacle in the accurate discussion of the corrections to this relation as predicted from chiral symmetry breaking ( see , for example , the discussion on page 1086 of ref .",
    "an accurate test requires a knowledge of the @xmath12nn coupling constant to a precision of about 1% , so as to match the experimental precision of the other quantities in the goldberger  treiman relation .",
    "the present situation is summarized in table  i with uncertainties as quoted by the authors . in the 1980 s , the @xmath12nn coupling constant",
    "was believed to be well known . in particular , koch and",
    "pietarinen  @xcite determined a value of the charged - pion coupling constant , @xmath13 , from @xmath14p scattering data , while kroll@xcite found the neutral - pion coupling constant @xmath15 = 14.52(40 ) from a pp forward dispersion relation .",
    "this was put in question in the early 1990 s , when the nijmegen group published a series of papers  @xcite where they reported smaller values on the basis of energy - dependent partial - wave analyses ( pwa ) of nn scattering data .",
    "they obtained @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "similarly low values with @xmath18 about 13.7 have also been found by the virginia tech group  @xcite from an analysis of both @xmath14n and nn data . using a similar pwa method in the @xmath0p sector ,",
    "timmermans@xcite found a value of 13.45(14 ) .",
    "these more recent analyses often suffer from the drawback that they rely on the joint analysis of large data bases from many experiments with some of the data rejected according to various criteria .",

    "this relation has been repeatedly evaluated in the past @xcite .",

    ", all the major ingredients in the gmo relation can now be discussed as experimentally derived quantities with transparent sources of uncertainty .",
    "further , the approach can be improved by the observation that isospin conservation , which was previously assumed , can be replaced by the weaker assumption of charge symmetry .",
    "this avoids the possibility of perturbations from the rather important violation of isospin symmetry expected to be associated with the @xmath23p and @xmath23n scattering lengths @xcite .",
    "the gmo relation can now be completely evaluated on the basis of data closely linked to direct experiments and it then determines the charged - pion coupling .",
    "we will develop this aspect below and also give a discussion of uncertainties in the dispersion integral .",

    "it is convenient to write the expression ( [ eq : gmorelation ] ) in a simplified form with numerical coefficients :    @xmath33    throughout this paper the scattering lengths are in units of @xmath34 , and @xmath22 , given in mb , corresponds to    @xmath35    everything is in principle measurable to good precision .",

    "it is thus extremely important to obtain an accurate number for the small isoscalar amplitude .",
    "this quantity can be evaluated with small statistical and systematic uncertainties from the experimental @xmath1d scattering length , assuming the validity of charge symmetry , i.e. that the scattering lengths @xmath44 and @xmath45 are equal .",
    "this approximation is expected to be excellent , since the recent estimate of the isospin violation effect in this amplitude , mainly due to virtual photon effects @xcite , suggests that this leads to an increase of the coupling constant by only 0.2% .",
    "the cross section integral @xmath22 is at present becoming the largest source of error .",
    "uncertainties from the small @xmath2d term will not have a major impact on the result .",
    "we now turn to a critical discussion of the different contributions .",
    "the @xmath2p scattering length contributes the bulk of the gmo relation and must be very accurately controlled .",
    "it is deduced from the energy shift in pionic hydrogen , which ( to about 2% ) is proportional to the scattering length .",
    "the highly accurate value from psi  @xcite has an uncertainty dominated by systematics in the analysis .",
    "the accuracy in the procedure for extracting the scattering length , with a number of small corrections of electromagnetic origin , has been discussed in detail by sigg _",
    "et al . _",
    "the corrections include those for the finite nucleon and pion size as well as the feedback of the strong interaction shift on the long - ranged vacuum polarization .",
    "these can all be calculated to a precision more than an order of magnitude better than the present experimental error .",
    "they also include the effect of the proton e.m .",
    "the crucial step in the analysis is the modeling of the hadronic interaction .",
    "_ have simulated this by using a short - ranged potential for each of the isospin states with the strength tuned to the corresponding free scattering length in the absence of the open @xmath23 channel .",
    "they then introduce the open channel via coupled klein ",
    "gordon equations and explore the correction for different interaction ranges , with values near 0.7 @xmath46 that are considered realistic .",
    "the correction and uncertainty are mainly associated with the conversion between charged and neutral pions due to the available phase space .",
    "the final theoretical uncertainty is given as 0.5% , larger than the statistical uncertainty of 0.2% .",
    "we have examined the procedure and agree with the quoted electromagnetic corrections and their precision , provided the hadronic interaction is tuned to correctly reproduce the experimental energy shift .",
    "the treatment of the corrections in the hadronic part , however could be improved , although it is convincing to a level of a few % .",
    "lipartia et al . have demonstrated that chiral effective field theory ( eft ) gives the same result as the potential approach at least to next to leading order @xcite if the physical amplitude is reproduced .",
    "this result is similar to the invariance of the leading order e. m. correction due to gauge invariance in a energy - dependent potential description@xcite .",
    "it is thus reasonable to simulate the range dependence of the @xmath20n s - wave amplitude using potentials , provided the low energy expansion of the s - wave scattering amplitude @xmath47 is correctly reproduced to order q@xmath48 .",
    "this latter approach automatically includes the wave function modification by the extended charge distribution , an effect of higher order in the eft approach , but which gives here the largest numerical correction .",
    "however , the procedure in ref .",
    "@xcite does not respect the empirical values for the ` range ' terms , which leads to a larger uncertainty than the one quoted for their correction .",
    "the negative sign of the correction term and its approximate magnitude of @xmath49% is basically correct . to account for the present inconsistency with the range expansion and using the numerical range of variation of sigg et al .",

    "@xcite , since this should be investigated specifically @xcite .",

    "@xcite is absent in the difference between the @xmath30p amplitudes , which is the quantity relevant to the gmo relation for the @xmath12nn coupling constant .",
    "the experimental @xmath2d scattering length is derived from the energy shift in the @xmath2d atom in close analogy to the case of the @xmath2p scattering length .",
    "the deuteron electromagnetic corrections can in practice be calculated using a deuteron charge distribution , that correctly reproduces the experimental deuteron charge radius .",

    "the electromagnetic corrections produced to the the strong @xmath12d amplitude should be included , however .",

    "an alternative estimate is obtained from the gauge correction to the @xmath1n amplitude due to the coulomb field of the proton , treated as a static spectator . using the empirical @xmath12n range parameters this gives a contribution @xmath59 with @xmath60 mev . a related estimate in a leading order chiral",
    "approach gives a correction @xmath61@xcite , but it is based only on the isovector term and does not include the constraints of the phenomenological range expansion . in the absence of correlations between the nucleons ,",
    "the isovector range term does not contribute to leading order and it is further suppressed by its empirical weakness .",
    "we adopt the average of the first two estimates of @xmath62 for this correction with an uncertainty of @xmath63 .",
    "this is well inside the present uncertainty in the theoretical deuteron scattering length ( see table iv ) and has little influence on the present investigation .    in summary , we have adopted the following scattering lengths deduced from the data on the @xmath1p atom@xcite and the @xmath1d atom@xcite with the modifications described above .",

    "the part of the gmo relation , eq . ( 4 ) , that it has not been possible to determine accurately up to now is the term proportional to the coherent , symmetric combination of the scattering lengths @xmath72 .",
    "assuming isospin symmetry , this is the isoscalar scattering length @xmath73 .",
    "it follows from recent measurements of the hadronic energy shift and width of the pionic hydrogen atom  @xcite that this gives a directly determined value @xmath74 . however , the accuracy of this direct determination is not sufficient for our present purpose .",
    "it is very difficult to determine @xmath73 with precision , directly from the coherent sum of the individual @xmath1p and @xmath75p scattering lengths , because these cancel to a few per cent . on the other hand , assuming only charge symmetry , this quantity is identical to the coherent scattering length for a negative pion on the neutron and proton , @xmath76/2 , which is the leading contribution to the accurately known @xmath77 scattering length .",
    "the accuracy of this approximation is indicated by a recent estimate of the isospin violation effect in the amplitude ratio @xmath78  @xcite such that    @xmath79    provided the remaining contributions can be reliably calculated , it is then possible to deduce the relevant coherent combination directly from the deuteron data with only minor assumptions concerning isospin symmetry .",
    "the situation is exceptionally favorable for the application of multiple scattering methods .",
    "the deuteron is a very loosely bound system and its wave function is accurately known .",

    "such an approximation is appropriate if the two scatterers are well separated , as is the case for the bulk of the contributions in the case of the deuteron as a consequence of its loose binding .",
    "the rather small non - local correction must , however , be controlled in sign and magnitude at the level of precision aimed for here .",
    "however , it is not necessary to describe this effect very accurately .",
    "the non - local effects enter mainly in the description of the isovector @xmath12n s - wave interaction , which is well known to be closely associated with @xmath100-meson exchange and which heavily dominates the double scattering term . for calculational convenience",
    "it has been conventional to model the non - locality of the scattering amplitude in terms of a separable form , @xmath101 , with a monopole form factor @xmath102 . since the initial and final pion",

    "we conservatively consider that plausible values for the parameter @xmath107 lie in the interval @xmath108 .",
    "this is a wide range , which should adequately cover any model dependence of the result .",
    "these values have been obtained using two extremes of strong form factors for the double scattering term .",
    "one choice is to consider each of the scatterings to be associated with a monopole form factor .",
    "since the isovector scattering strongly dominates the double scattering , the natural cut - off parameter is the @xmath109-meson mass",
    ". this would give the same correction as quoted in table ii for @xmath110 .",
    "another choice is include in addition a strong form factor of typical @xmath111-meson range for both the pion and the nucleon .",
    "the effective overall form factor in each of the pion scatterings is then a dipole form factor with the @xmath100-meson mass , corresponding to @xmath112 .",
    "it should be observed that the typical modification of @xmath113 is a negative contribution by 4 to 8% corresponding to a positive contribution to @xmath114 of 9 to 20 @xmath115 .",
    "we choose the mean of these two approaches as a typical value with the spread setting the scale of the uncertainty , but note that in doing so we may somewhat underestimate the non - local effect , such that our final value of @xmath116 may be somewhat too low .",
    "we found that the results reported by b  k in ref .",
    "@xcite , table 3 , for the realistic bonn1 and bonn2 wave functions did not include the form factor ( contrary to the statement in the paper ) , which the authors confirm .",
    "we have received their corrected and extended results @xcite for the bonn1 potential .",
    "note that at the present level of precision it is important to use potentials fully consistently .",
    "the bonn1 potential is energy - dependent ; as a consequence , orthonormality can only be respected in matrix elements calculated using this potential if non - trivial weight factors are introduced in the integrands . to eliminate this uncertainty",
    "we use here the similar , but energy - independent , bonn2 potential .",
    "b  k consider without arguments cut - off values @xmath117 and @xmath118 in the form factor ; this gives positive contributions to the scattering length as compared to the point - like static approximation of 36 , 27 and 22 @xmath119 , respectively .",
    "there are good physical reasons to believe that @xmath109-meson exchange sets the scale for the dominant isovector amplitude with a larger value for the effective @xmath107 . to be conservative we take @xmath120 and @xmath121 for the cut off as limits for this systematic correction from the non - localities and use the central value of these two extremes as the correction .",

    "our correction is smaller than the one found by b ",
    "non - locality is one of the largest theoretical sources of systematic uncertainty in corrections to the point - like static approximation .",
    "the nature of the leading non - static corrections and the reasons why the static expression ( fixed scattering centers ) still remains an excellent approximation are well understood . at first sight ,",
    "even the single scattering amplitudes have rather important non - static modifications , representing about 30% of the total @xmath12d scattering length .",
    "such corrections are systematically generated by the multiple scattering description in which physical amplitudes are used , thus guaranteeing the correct behavior of the scattered wave at large distances .",
    "the emphasis is thus not on the near - zone behavior of the scattering as in pseudo - potential or effective lagrangian approaches . in a situation like the present one ,",
    "this leads to a systematic cancellation of unitary binding corrections between single scattering and double scattering terms , when these are introduced consistently .",
    "this phenomenon was first demonstrated in the present context for an analytically soluble model by fldt @xcite .",

    "this gives 0.133  mb in the range @xmath235  gev / c , with a small statistical error and a systematic error of about @xmath236  mb or @xmath237% in @xmath238 .",
    "in addition , the 1994 version of the pdg tables@xcite also lists a fit to these data from 4.03 gev / c to 240 gev / c ( table 33.3 ) . using the fitted expression",
    ", we have evaluated the contribution in the same interval as above using this expression and find 0.155  mb .",
    "this is 0.022  mb higher than the value of 0.133  mb by direct evaluation , but in good general agreement .",
    "this larger value has been used in several previous gmo evaluations@xcite .",
    "we prefer the lower value as more transparently linked to the actual data .",
    "finally , there is a small , but not negligible , contribution from the very high - energy region from 240 gev / c to @xmath239 .",
    "we determine this from the donnachie ",
    "landshoff regge fit to the data  @xcite , which describes the observed cross section difference well at the highest energies .",
    "this fit is a sum of two regge terms , one arising from pomeron exchange and the second from lower - lying resonance exchange .",
    "it gives a contribution of 0.030  mb .",
    "alternatively , one might consider using the three - term fit ( one for the pomeron and two for the reggeons ) in the 1998 pdg tables ( table  38.2 ) , which gives 0.018  mb .",
    "this low value is not surprising , since the 1998 pdg parameterization gives a difference 27% lower than the pdg 1994 one in the region above 200  gev / c , at variance with the data  @xcite . at lower energies",
    ", this parameterization agrees better with the data in the region of 100  gev / c  @xcite .",
    "we have also used a recent high - energy fit based on a two - pomeron pole expression fully compatible with universality , regge factorization , weak regge exchange degeneracy , and generalized vector dominance model  @xcite .",
    "this parameterization ( see eq .  ( 13 ) and table  1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) gives a contribution of 0.025  mb .",
    "the corresponding uncertainties , given in table  vii , come mainly from the 4% uncertainty in the regge intercept .",
    "this spread of values according to the model considered for the fit introduces an additional systematic uncertainty of 0.006  mb from this high - energy region .",
    "the integrated coulomb correction above 2 gev / c is negligible , since it is only 0.003 mb using the estimate of ref . @xcite as given in the beginning of this section .",
    "the purpose of this section has been to establish the importance of different energy regions for the integral j@xmath198 and their contribution to the uncertainty .",
    "since there exists total cross sections from state of the art partial wave analysis up to 2 gev / c we first studied the accuracy to which such an approach describes contributions to j@xmath198 based on actual data in the region 0.16 to 2 gev / c .",
    "to this end , we evaluated the contributions to @xmath22 from data in different energy regions with no coulomb corrections other than those introduced by the experimental authors ( nuclear cross sections ) .",
    "the results are summarized in tables vi and vii .",
    "the statistical uncertainty in the evaluation is small .",
    "the trapezoidal formula was used to integrate the data and the corresponding statistical errors were added quadratically . within the different integration ranges ,",
    "as given in the tables , the systematic error was calculated by varying the experimental results inside the interval defined by the quoted systematic error .",
    "the full systematic uncertainty was obtained by the quadratic sum of the error in each interval , since their origin is different .",
    "we then confronted these results with the analogous quantities obtained from the partial wave analysis sm99 .",
    "the main deviations occurs in the experimentally difficult region 0.55 - 0.70 gev / c .",
    "since the partial wave solution incorporates additional experimental constraints , we consider it superior to the direct data in the crucial region and we base the further analysis on the pwa solution sm99 .",
    "we then examine the e.m .",
    "these are under theoretical control inside the pwa analysis .",
    "the uncertainties in these corrections are less important than the systematic difference between data and the pwa solution .",
    "the consequence of the @xmath240 mass splitting is negligible .",
    "the low energy region below 0.16 gev / c contributes little to j@xmath198 and there are no experimental total cross sections in this region .",
    "it is strongly constrained by the @xmath1p scattering length and the tail of the @xmath241 resonance such that it can be well controlled without the necessity of e.m .",
    "corrections .",
    "the systematic uncertainty has its origin principally in the region above 4 gev / c .",
    "there is also a sizeable systematic uncertainty that is due to the inconsistencies of the @xmath1p data in the region 550 - 700 mev / c , although we have probably overestimated this uncertainty .",
    "we find from table vii , rows 1517 , that three different descriptions , based on the sm99 pwa below 2  gev / c , give values in a rather narrow range ; @xmath242  mb , @xmath243  mb and @xmath244  mb .",
    "the difference between these values is smaller than the estimated systematic uncertainty .",
    "we also give in row 14 the less negative result obtained with the older sm95 pwa below 2  gev / c and the fit pdg94 in the momentum range from 4.03 to 240 gev / c : @xmath245  mb .",
    "we have chosen the average of these four values as characteristic of the integral .",
    "the systematic uncertainty provides an adequate band of possible values , so that    @xmath246    our result for @xmath22 is close to the unpublished value of koch @xcite , j @xmath247 mb , which is the only previous explicitly documented and detailed evaluation known to us .",
    "the main difference in the input data with koch is an updated evaluation of the contributions from the high - energy region and better control of e.m .",
    "corrections . we show also that the @xmath197 mass splitting is unimportant and include an improved discussion of the threshold region using modern data .",
    "it is important to realize that the main uncertainty to j@xmath198 comes from the very high energy contribution .",
    "it is difficult to ascribe a major uncertainty to the coulomb corrections .",
    "we note that the previous evaluations of j@xmath198 quoted in table v without uncertainties stay within our range of errors .",
    "in conclusion , we summarize our work as follows .",
    "we first derived new values for the @xmath12n scattering lengths , using the @xmath1d atomic data analyzed in an improved theoretical approach .",
    "the statistical and systematic uncertainties contributions were thoroughly examined .",
    "the corresponding @xmath157d scattering length gives a nearly direct determination of the small isoscalar @xmath1n scattering length to good precision . from this constraint together with the @xmath248p scattering length from pionic hydrogen we obtain a high precision value also for the isovector length .",
    "in fact when we examine the basic experimental input of the highly accurately quoted scattering length @xmath249 , deduced from the @xmath1p atomic energy shift and quoted to high accuracy  @xcite , we found that there are small inconsistencies in their current procedure at the level of @xmath250 .",
    "this should be improved , since the precision is otherwise unsatisfactory for the determination of the @xmath0nn coupling constant .",
    "in addition , the experimental accuracy is now so high that systematics in the theoretical analysis of the @xmath1d scattering length is the main source of uncertainty in the disentangling of the isospin components of the @xmath12n scattering length .",
    "the dominant limitation to higher accuracy is the dispersive contribution from the physical absorption process @xmath1d @xmath135 nn . a thorough modern re - examination of this contribution",
    "is highly desirable",
    ". our analysis does not assume strict isospin symmetry , although we do not see any signs of violation at the present level of precision .",
    "we present the results , however , so that they can be directly used in discussions of the validity of this symmetry .",
    "the values we find using the empirical @xmath1p and @xmath2d scattering lengths from subsection 4.1 , eqs .",
    "( 20 ) and ( 21 ) , are    @xmath251    @xmath252    these values are based on theoretical improvements on previous work .",
    "( see also comments and footnote after eq .",
    "( 21 ) . )",
    "our second conclusion concerns the charged @xmath12nn coupling constant , which can be derived from the gmo forward dispersion relation , using our new , accurate value for the symmetric @xmath12n scattering length ( [ a+final ] ) .",

    "its dominant systematic uncertainty comes from the region above 4 gev / c .",
    "previous determinations using the gmo relation @xcite will all give similar results , provided one uses the empirical scattering lengths , which are by now well established .",
    "is consistent with our result , but the systematic uncertainties are not well controlled .",
    "in particular , there is a substantial additional systematic error of about 0.25 or more from the isoscalar scattering length .",
    "in addition , they use a value for @xmath219 derived from an average of those given in refs . @xcite with the spread of values as the only uncertainty . of these values ,",
    "two ( refs.@xcite ) do not state any uncertainty at all , while ref .",
    "@xcite states the ( small ) statistical uncertainty only . in particular , the rather large uncertainty from the high energy region 4 - 240 gev / c is neglected . note that the particle data group 1994 fit to the region 4 - 240",
    "gev / c gives a + 0.02 mb higher contribution to @xmath219 ( table vii , line 10 ) than the direct data of the 1998 version ( table vii , line 9 ) .",
    "the latter corresponds to a 0.10 higher value of the coupling constant . ]",
    "the value , @xmath255 , which we obtain for the coupling constant is intermediate between the low value of about 13.6 deduced from the large data banks of nn and @xmath12n scattering data using the pwa approach @xcite and the high value of 14.52(26 ) from np charge exchange cross sections@xcite .",
    "the uncertainties in the determination of the coupling constant using any method are dominated by systematics .",
    "consequently , we have refrained from combining our result with those from other approaches .",
    "however , if the systematic error were to have gaussian distributions , our result differs from that of uppsala @xcite by only 1.25 standard deviations ( 21% probability ) and from that of pavan et al.@xcite by 1.7 standard deviations ( 8% probability ) .",
    "the pwa results have probably systematic errors far larger than the small statistical errors to judge from the corresponding situation using the data banks with dispersive constraints@xcite , but this is not quantified yet .",
    "the modification of the value of @xmath22 required to accommodate a value of 13.6 is about 10% .",
    "the major part of such a modification would most likely come from the region above 2 gev / c , which implies changes in the contributions from that region of the order of 50% .",
    "such large changes appear unlikely to us .",
    "we therefore conclude that the present evaluation of the gmo sum rule , with quantitatively controlled uncertainties in the input values for the @xmath12n isoscalar scattering length , as well as for the cross section integral @xmath22 , does not readily support the conclusion of the indirect pwa determinations that the @xmath12nn coupling is close to 13.6 .",
    "it should be noted that our value has consistently been evaluated in a conservative way , such that the parameters used in the evaluation systematically lead to a value for the coupling constant , which is somewhat on the low side .",
    "the strongest support for a relatively low value of the coupling constant comes from the careful dispersive analysis by pavan _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , based on the vpi / gwu pwa description of @xmath12n scattering .",
    "it selectively concentrates on pion - dominated amplitudes .",
    "they find a value of @xmath256 , where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic .",
    "the authors use a variety of dispersive methods and find @xmath257 .",
    "this value is small , but it has the opposite sign from ours .",
    "they evaluate the gmo relation as a consistency check and find a value of @xmath258 , in agreement with their dispersion result .",
    "since their evaluation is constrained by the experimental @xmath1p scattering length and their value for the dispersive integral @xmath22 is nearly the same as ours , which is based to a large extent on their pwa analysis , the difference with our result must be almost entirely ascribed to the difference in the value of @xmath73 , a small quantity , which is difficult to calculate from scattering data .",
    "the origin of this difference is not known yet , but it might originate in the treatment of small electromagnetic corrections to the scattering data . the minor inconsistency in their analysis is of little importance for most of their discussions , but it becomes highly relevant in the present context .",
    "it is interesting to examine the consequences of our analysis for the goldberger ",
    "treiman ( gt ) discrepancy @xcite . following the discussion in ref.@xcite",
    "the value for the coupling constant found here corresponds to a discrepancy of @xmath259 , with @xmath260 defined as @xmath261    this corresponds to a @xmath12nn monopole form factor with a cut - off @xmath262 80 mev / c .",
    "there exists no direct experimental information on this form factor , which is inherently an off - mass - shell quantity . on the other hand , within the framework of pcac",
    ", it is naturally expected to be similar to the axial form factor of the nucleon , a dipole with a 1 gev / c cut - off .",
    "this expectation has been confirmed in many models , using a variety of approaches @xcite , beginning with ref . @xcite .",
    "such values are fully consistent with our findings for the coupling constant .",
    "in contrast to these rather soft form factors , the deuteron properties , and in particular its quadrupole moment , require an effective cut - off of 1.3 gev / c or more , since the tensor force otherwise becomes too weak  @xcite .",
    "it is , however , believed at present that this hard effective form factor is generated by the correlated exchange of an interacting @xmath263-pair , which generates additional tensor strength , when explicitly accounted for : the true one - pion - exchange form factor is softer @xcite . a low value for the coupling constant should therefore not be considered an advantage in resolving the goldberger  treiman discrepancy .",
    "additional support for a coupling constant @xmath18 somewhat larger than 14 comes from the recent measurements by raichle _",
    "et al . _ of polarized np total cross sections  @xcite . from these",
    ", the pion - dominated @xmath264 parameter can be determined .",
    "they find that it is systematically larger than the values in the phase - shift analysis pwa93 of the nijmegen group  @xcite .",
    "if the discrepancy persists in other pwas , this observation suggests , as a possible partial explanation , that the pwa coupling constant is too small . in any case",
    ", it points to an unexplained discrepancy with those pwa analyses on which the argument for a low coupling constant is based .    in order to facilitate future improvements on the present work ,",
    "we have presented the various corrections in such a way that modifications of any individual contributions can be readily incorporated without the necessity of a complete re - analysis .",
    "we see three main areas in which the present work can be improved .",
    "first , theoretical investigations of the relation between the hadronic energy shift of the pionic atom and the scattering length should diminish the present uncertainty in the deduced @xmath1p and @xmath1d scattering lengths by a factor of at least 2 .",
    "second , the measurement to high precision of the width in pionic hydrogen should give a separation of the isospin components in the @xmath1p scattering lengths to similar precision as that obtained from the deuteron data , but without invoking deuteron structure .",
    "third , studies of the dispersion shift for threshold pion absorption on the deuteron should eliminate a major uncertainty in the theoretical treatment of the @xmath1d scattering length .",
    "this would allow the @xmath12nn coupling constant to be determined to 1% precision .",
    "we are particularly indebted to r. l. arndt , v. v. baru , a. e. kudryatsev , m. pavan and m. sainio for providing us with unpublished material and to d. bugg , m. ericson , g. fldt , j. gasser , w.  r.  gibbs , g.  hhler , o.  krehl , s.  krewald , m.  lacombe , u .- g .",
