    "modern cosmology suffers a hierarchy of missing mass problems .",
    "most famously , there appears to be more gravitating mass than can be accounted for with baryons while maintaining consistency with big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) : @xmath2 this , together with the need to grow large scale structure , leads to the inference of non - baryonic cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "in addition to the dynamical missing mass problem , there is also the missing baryon problem ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our inventory of known baryons in the local universe , summing over all observed stars , gas , etc . , comes up short of the total anticipated from bbn : @xmath3 for example , @xcite estimate that the sum of stars and cold gas is only @xmath4 of @xmath1 . while there now seems to be a good chance that many of the missing baryons are in the form of highly ionized gas in the warm  hot intergalactic medium ( the whim",
    " see mathur , these proceedings ) , we are still far from being able to give a confident accounting of where all the baryons reside",
    ". indeed , there could be multiple distinct reservoirs in addition to the whim , each comparable to the mass in stars , within the current uncertainties .    here",
    "i highlight the halo by halo missing baryon problem .",
    "in addition to the global missing baryon problem , there seems to be a mismatch between the mass of baryons in individual galaxies and the mass of their host halos . for the amount of dark matter",
    "we infer dynamically , the mass in detected baryons falls short of the cosmic baryon fraction : @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the mass fraction of detected baryons in a given object , and the cosmic baryon fraction is @xmath7 ( @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the virial mass of any given galaxy is a rather notional quantity , and there are many possible mappings between the observed baryonic content and the inferred dark mass .",
    "nevertheless , there is a pronounced regularity to the data that does not tumble naturally out of our @xmath8cdm theory .",
    "before proceeding with a discussion of the missing baryon problem in individual dark matter halos , it is worth reviewing @xmath1 .",
    "it is commonly stated that we have entered the era of precision cosmology .",
    "if this is true , then there is a tension between @xmath9 and 0.04 that should concern us .    ; the first point is the famous @xmath10 value of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* walker  ( 1991 ) ) .",
    "note that no measurement of any isotope ever suggested a value @xmath11 ( horizontal dotted line ) prior to the appearance of relevant cmb data ( vertical dotted line ) . with the exception of the case of no cdm ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mcgaugh 1999 , 2004 ) ) , no cmb fit has ever suggested @xmath12 .",
    "measured values of some isotopes seem to have drifted upwards towards the cmb values since 2000 , a worrisome trend given the historical tendency for cosmological measurements to track one another.,width=480 ]    one of the great successes of cosmology is bbn .",
    "the abundance of the light elements depends on a single parameter , the baryon - to - photon ratio , that maps directly to the baryon density .",
    "independent measurements of @xmath13h , @xmath14he , and @xmath15li all indicate nearly the same value for @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , modern observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) provide another similar constraint on the baryon density .",
    "the consistency of the independent bbn constraints is impressive , and i have little doubt that the basic picture is correct .",
    "however , the agreement is not perfect .",
    "there seems to be a modest dichotomy between each of the independent methods ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bbn ] ) , with each preferring a slightly different value of @xmath1 .",
    "table  [ tab : bbn ] shows a comparison of baryon densities by method .",
    "values are the median for each case from the compilation of @xcite assuming @xmath16 .",
    "the uncertainty is taken from the variance of different published measurements .",
    "this tends to overstate the error claimed by individual determinations . for this uncertainty ,",
    "the light elements are broadly consistent .",
    "if we look only at the latest wmap result ( @xcite ) , its tiny uncertainty makes it difficult to reconcile with the helium and lithium .",

    "though consistently in the vicinity of @xmath22 , the weak dependence of @xmath23 on @xmath1 makes it difficult to obtain a precise estimate from helium . moreover , independent determinations vary by more than they should for the stated errors .",
    "this is likely due to the many subtle systematic effects that afflict helium abundance determinations at the @xmath24 level ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , while the broad consistency of helium with other determinations is comforting , it seems unlikely that it can provide a strong constraint on the precise value of @xmath1 .",
    "we should not take this as a free pass to simply ignore helium ; _ all _ determinations of @xmath23 up to the date of my review gave @xmath25 , and i found it increasingly difficult to reconcile any of the helium data with @xmath26 ( but see @xcite ) .    * lithium : * measured in low metallicity stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , lithium gives the next lowest value for @xmath1 .",

    "the dashed ( middle ) line is set to the deuterium value ( @xmath32 ) with @xmath7 ( case 2 ) .",

    "the cmb is exquisitely sensitive to both the absolute baryon density and the baryon fraction , but also suffers degeneracies between these and other parameters ( especially the tilt).,width=480 ]    * cmb : * the microwave background provides another constraint on @xmath1 that is independent of abundance measurements .",
    "it gives a value for @xmath1 that is close to but persistently higher than all of the light elements .",
    "the power spectrum of the cmb is very sensitive to both the absolute density of baryons ( @xmath1 ) and the global baryon fraction ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "[ fig : cmb ] illustrates this sensitivity with three cases : ( 1 ) a plausibly low baryon density , low baryon fraction universe ; ( 2 ) a high baryon density , high baryon fraction universe , and ( 3 ) a low density , no - cdm universe .",
    "* case ( 1 ) * is motivated by the lithium baryon density ( table  [ tab : bbn ] ) .",
    "for this value of @xmath1 , @xmath31 as observed in clusters ( @xcite ; see also holder , these proceedings ) if @xmath33 , consistent with peculiar velocity measurements ( @xmath34 : @xcite ) .",
    "these three independent lines of evidence provide a self consistent and reasonable set of cosmological constraints .",
    "however , they badly overestimate the amplitude of the second acoustic peak .",
    "this problem is generic to all concordance @xmath8cdm models prior to the first measurement of the second peak in 2000 .",
    "* case ( 2 ) * utilizes the deuterium abundance , which gives the highest @xmath1 of all the bbn elements and the one most consistent with fits to the cmb .",
    "a baryon fraction @xmath7 is adopted , giving a plausible @xmath35 . though rigged to be as consistent as possible with cmb fits without simply adopting them , this case still over - predicts the amplitude of the second peak , albeit by a lesser amount than case ( 1 ) .",
    "* case ( 3 ) * uses the lithium @xmath1 with zero cdm .",
    "consideration of this model is motivated by mond , but uses entirely conventional physics .",
    "it provides quite a good fit to the second peak .",
    "indeed , this was the only successful _ a proiri _ prediction of its amplitude ( @xcite ) .",
    "here it merely illustrates the sensitivity to @xmath30 as well as @xmath1 .    like all models devoid of cdm , case ( 3 ) under - predicts the amplitude of the third peak , just as un - tilted @xmath8cdm models over - predict it ( e.g. , cases 1 and 2 ) .",
    "this ` low ' third peak leads to the inference of a tilt ( @xmath36 ) , which in turn impacts the inferred baryon density , somewhat reducing it relative to previous cmb determinations . in the context of mond",
    ", the ` high ' third peak implies a driving term analogous to that provided by cdm .",
    "this occurs naturally in teves - like relativistic mond theories ( @xcite ) , but it is unclear how this might affect @xmath1 .",
    "bbn is undoubtedly one of the shining successes of modern cosmology .",
    "there is broad agreement between multiple independent lines of evidence to an accuracy rarely witnessed in cosmology .",
    "i have little doubt that the basic picture is correct .    in detail",
    ", there are significant differences between independent methods .",
    "it is common to point to the great consistency between @xmath1 from bbn and the cmb as support for the @xmath8cdm picture .",
    "however , this is rather sloppy , being only really true for deuterium .",
    "lithium and helium prefer noticeably lower values for the baryon density .",
    "the light elements themselves provide a self - consistent picture if we adopt the uncertainties listed in table  [ tab : bbn ] .",
    "it is the tiny uncertainty in the cmb determination that is problematic .",
    "the cmb is indeed that sensitive ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cmb ] ) , but does suffer from parameter degeneracies , in particular the tilt and the baryon fraction .",
    "the tension between the light elements and the cmb disappears if there is no cdm .",
    "it appears that the true baryon density is not yet as precisely known as might be hoped .",
    "nevertheless , the missing baryon problem remains an issue at low redshift . whether the true baryon density is 3% of critical or 4% depends on whether one gives more weight to light element measurements or cmb fits .",
    "either way , @xmath1 exceeds the well - determined inventory of local baryons ( @xcite ) .",
    "as well as trying to account for all the baryons in the universe , and the integrated amount in galaxies , clusters , and the igm ( see frenk ; moore , these proceedings ) , it would be nice to have an accounting in individual systems .",
    "each dark matter halo can , to a first approximation , be thought of as a microcosm of the whole . as such",
    ", one would naively expect each halo to have the same baryon fraction as the whole universe . on the scale of clusters of galaxies , this is approximately true . for individual galaxies ,",
    "observations depart from this ideal in a way which we have yet to understand .",
    "our own galaxy provides an illustration of the general problem .",
    "we have a rather complete inventory of local baryons that appears to be fairly consistent between independent estimates .",
    "yet when we compare the baryonic mass to the total dynamical mass , it falls well short of the universal baryon fraction .    for illustration ,",
    "i adopt estimates of the baryonic mass from the recent work of @xcite : @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "most of the stellar mass is in the disk , though the spit between disk and bulge depends somewhat on details like the disk scale length .",
    "the gas mass is split between molecular and atomic components .",
    "other baryonic components appear to be negligible .",
    "the total baryonic mass of the milky way is thus @xmath39 .",
    "the baryonic masses of satellite galaxies within the milky way halo add little to this sum .",
    "their total is probably less than the uncertainty in the milky way mass , and certainly less than @xmath40 .",
    "it is thus hard to imagine that the baryonic mass associated with the milky way halo is any larger than @xmath41 .",
    "the total mass of the milky way has been studied many times .",
    "the answer persistently comes back in the vicinity of @xmath42 .",
    "there are many uncertainties in this estimate , the dominant one being whether the most distant tracer , leo i , is considered to be bound to the milky way or not .",
    "@xcite give @xmath43 with leo i and @xmath44 without it .",
    "a practical lower limit is @xmath45 ; half this is already encompassed within the radius of the lmc .    taking these numbers at face value , @xmath46 this falls well short of the universal baryon fraction , @xmath7 . pushing the numbers to their extremes",
    ", we can place the limit @xmath47 .",
    "this is at least within hailing distance of @xmath48 from clusters , but still well short of the cmb value .",
    "this raises the question : where are all the baryons that should be associated with the milky way halo ?",
    "perhaps they have been expelled , though the milky way is generally thought to be too massive to have suffered much of this .",
    "another possibility is that they lurk in the halo in some as yet undetected form , like a local whim .",
    "while the whim is a great candidate for many of the globally missing baryons ( see mathur , these proceedings ) , it appears to fall well short of what is needed to explain this deficit in the milky way ( @xcite ) , providing perhaps @xmath49 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the milky way is not unique in having @xmath50 .",
    "similar discrepancies are observed in many systems ( @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , @xmath51 appears to deviate systematically from @xmath30 by an amount which becomes increasingly severe in systems of decreasing circular velocity .",
    "a basic tenet of cdm theory is a relation between halo mass and circular velocity at the virial radius ( @xcite ) of the form @xmath52 with the normalization depending on the cosmology ( @xcite ) .",
    "we can measure neither of these quantities .",
    "what we can measure is the baryonic mass of a given galaxy and a characteristic circular velocity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tfpair ] ) .",
    "cdm if all the baryons in each halo are identified.,width=480 ]    summing up the mass in stars and gas for a large sample of spiral galaxies , we obtain the baryonic tully - fisher relation : @xmath53 with @xmath54 in solar masses and @xmath55 in @xmath56 ( fig .",

    "extrapolation of the baryonic tully - fisher relation to the cluster scale does less well , over - predicting the median cluster mass by a factor of @xmath58 .",
    "perhaps these are simply different systems , and such a vast extrapolation is unwarranted . on the other hand , coming this close with an extrapolation over several decades in mass is fairly remarkable .",
    "that clusters fall a little below the extrapolation of the baryonic tully - fisher relation may suggest that our census of baryons is not complete in these systems .",
    "if so , clusters might be a good place to look for some of the missing baryons .",
    "clusters are not a large contributor to the total integrated baryonic mass of the universe , so even if more baryons are lurking there , they are not likely to solve the missing baryon problem .",
    "placing them on the extrapolation of equation  [ eqn : btf ] would require ( _ very _ roughly ) 5% of @xmath1 . while not a large fraction of the total , this is comparable to all the stars in field galaxies .",

    "this near agreement deteriorates for smaller systems .",
    "the slope of the halo mass  virial velocity relation is shallower than the observed baryonic mass  circular velocity relation . even bearing in mind the caveat that the halo virial and observed circular velocities may not be simply related , it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the observed number of baryons is systematically less than the expected number as one goes down the mass function .",
    "if we take the halo mass  virial velocity relation as sacrosanct , then it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that @xmath51 varies with @xmath55 ( fig .",

    "the variation of @xmath51 with @xmath55 implies that there should be missing baryons associated with each and every galaxy halo ( see also zackrisson , these proceedings ) .",

    "what should we expect ?",
    "recent work gives some idea : ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mayer & moore ( 2004 ) ) and @xcite consider the effects of reionization while ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mo & mao ( 2004 ) ) consider the possibility of preheating in analogy with clusters .",
    "unfortunately , neither of these types of models matches the observed trend ( fig .",

    "in particular , there is no evidence in the data for the sudden transition expected around @xmath66 from reionization .    in the context of @xmath8cdm",

    "it is hard to imagine how @xmath51 can vary so much between bright and faint galaxies with virtually zero scatter along the way .",
    "somehow , a @xmath67 galaxy must ` know ' it should have @xmath68 and never 0.04 , while for a galaxy with @xmath69 the situation is reversed . the small observed scatter only happens naturally if @xmath70 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that essentially all the baryons are accounted for on galaxy scales , making individual galaxies an unlikely place to look for the missing baryons .",
