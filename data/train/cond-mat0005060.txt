    "although the finite size effects on phase transitions in thin films have been studied since a long time @xcite , only during the last decade it was discovered @xcite that in ferromagnetic ising films with surface fields of different sign but of the same strength @xmath15 (  competing walls  )",
    "novel types of phase transitions occur : namely , a phase transition occurs for zero bulk field @xmath16 from a state with an interface freely fluctuating in the center of the thin film to a state where the interface is bound either to the lower or to the upper wall confining the film , which then acquires a nonzero ( positive or negative ) magnetization .",
    "this interface localization - delocalization transition at @xmath14 may be either second @xcite or first order @xcite , and for film thicknesses @xmath1 the transition temperature @xmath14 does not converge towards the bulk critical temperature @xmath17 as usual @xcite , but rather towards the wetting transition temperature @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "now it is well - known that , in general , wetting transitions @xcite can be second or first order @xcite .",
    "thus it is plausible that also the interface localization - delocalization transition can be either second or first order .",
    "however , recently it was shown @xcite that also in cases where the wetting transition is first order , the transition @xmath14 may be second order for small enough thickness @xmath19 and become first order only for @xmath20 .",
    "thus the transition at @xmath21 is the finite - thickness analog of a wetting tricritical point @xcite .",
    "all this work @xcite has only considered the case @xmath22 , however .",
    "it is well known of course , that for @xmath1 , in the case of a first - order wetting transition at @xmath23 there exists at @xmath24 a prewetting transition @xcite , where the distance of the interface bound to the wall discontinuously jumps from a smaller value to a larger value . while the analog of this prewetting transition in thin films has been studied occasionally for the case of  capillary condensation  ( where on both walls fields act that have the same sign ) @xcite , it is only in the present work that the effect of prewetting phenomena on the interface localization - delocalization transition is considered @xcite .",
    "the physical systems that we have in mind are not magnets , of course , but rather binary ( a , b ) mixtures : as is well known , in an ising model context the  magnetization  simply translates into the relative concentration @xmath25 if one component ( a , say ) , and the field @xmath16 translates into the chemical potential difference @xmath26 between the species ( for simplicity we deal here with perfectly symmetric mixtures for which the bulk critical concentration is @xmath27 ) .",
    "however , one important aspect of binary mixtures is that physically it is a density of an extensive thermodynamic variable ( namely @xmath25 ) that is the fixed independent thermodynamic variable , rather than the intensive variable @xmath26 . as we shall see below",
    ", this fact has important consequences for the phase diagram of confined mixtures : the typical situation is that one encounters two successive lateral phase separation transitions !    in section 2 we elaborate these ideas by a qualitative discussion of the phase diagrams \\{both in the space of intensive variables ( @xmath28 ) and in the space ( @xmath29 ) } and of the corresponding physical state of the confined mixture .",
    "section 3 exemplifies these considerations by presenting a specific calculation for a symmetric polymer mixture , treated within a self - consistent field framework @xcite .",
    "there are numerous experimental studies of confined polymer mixtures @xcite and these systems might be convenient for testing our predictions .",
    "finally section 4 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "we assume here a binary mixture confined by  competing  walls in the sense that one wall attracts species a with the same strength as the opposite wall attracts species b , and consider the case of first - order wetting .",
    "then the topology of the phase diagram can be estimated from the qualitative considerations as shown in the left part of fig .  1 : in the space ( @xmath30 ) , bulk ( @xmath1 ) phase separation occurs for @xmath31 , and the walls are incompletely wet for @xmath32 but wet for @xmath33 . from the point",
    "@xmath34 there extend two ( first - order ) prewetting lines , which end at the prewetting critical points @xmath35 .",
    "these prewetting transitions correspond to singularities of the surface free energies associated with the lower and upper wall confining the mixture ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "due to the special symmetries chosen for our model , both the wetting transitions for the lower and upper wall coincide , and the prewetting critical temperatures are also the same .",
    "there is a mirror symmetry of the phase diagrams around the line @xmath36 ( upper part ) or @xmath37 ( lower part ) , respectively .    for finite thickness",
    "@xmath3 it may happen , as demonstrated by monte carlo simulations for ising models with enhanced exchange interactions near the walls @xcite , that a tricritical point at @xmath38 , @xmath21 , @xmath39 ( and @xmath37 ) occurs .",
    "for @xmath13 then there exists a single critical point at @xmath40 , @xmath31 ( and @xmath41 ) , there is no remnant of the prewetting phenomena left , and the phase diagram both in the ( @xmath30 ) plane as well as in the ( @xmath42 ) plane looks qualitatively exactly like in the bulk three - dimensional case . of course",
    ", we do expect a flatter shape near the critical point due to the occurence of the two - dimensional ising exponents \\{@xmath43 rather than @xmath44 with @xmath45 in the bulk @xcite}. but the situation differs very much for @xmath20 ( middle and right part of fig",
    ".  1 ) . in the semi - grand - canonical ensemble ( @xmath46 fixed ) , one experiences a single first order transition for @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the chemical potential reached for @xmath40 along the remnants of the prewetting lines . in the canonical ensemble @xmath49 fixed ) , we encounter a single first - order phase transition only if @xmath50 , which corresponds to @xmath31 , while for @xmath51 or for @xmath52 one encounters two successive first - order transitions when one lowers the temperature . only if one chooses @xmath53 , ( the critical concentration corresponding to the critical point @xmath54 ) or @xmath55 ( corresponding to @xmath56 ) one still encounters a ( two - dimensional ) critical behavior of phase separation , @xmath57 , and similarly @xmath58 . while @xmath59 as well as @xmath60 merge at @xmath61 as @xmath62 , @xmath59 and @xmath63 move outwards towards the prewetting critical concentration when @xmath1 . in this limit , the width of the two - phase coexistence regions for @xmath64 must shrink and ultimately vanish , since the difference in concentration on both sides of the pseudo - prewetting first order lines with respect to the average concentration @xmath25 of the film is an effect of order @xmath65 , and therefore  for @xmath1 the prewetting transitions are lines in the @xmath66 phase diagram and not split up in two - phase coexistence regions .    from this description",
    "it already is clear that the approach to the phase diagram of the bulk @xmath67 as @xmath1 is very nonuniform : for any finite @xmath3 the bulk transition is still rounded , and ( for @xmath68 or @xmath69 ) the first transition is a lateral phase separation corresponding to the prewetting transition and the second transition is another lateral phase separation at @xmath70 ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "for @xmath1 the phase diagram , hence , contains prewetting lines ( as in the left part of fig .  1 ) and a horizontal line at @xmath2 ( to which the triple line in the middle part of fig .",
    "1 has converged ) . of course , the pictures explaining the various phases in fig .",
    "2 are highly schematic , and in reality one expects the interface to turn around rather smoothly and avoid the 90@xmath71{0xb0}}% % beginexpansion { { } ^\\circ}% % endexpansion $ ] kinks . such smooth interfaces ( which also have an intrinsic width which need not be negligibly small in comparison with @xmath3 ) have in fact been observed in two - phase coexistence states associated with capillary condensation @xcite .",
    "thin polymeric films confined between walls may have interesting applications and can also be studied conveniently by a variety of experimental tools @xcite . in fact , the  soft mode   phase @xcite with a single fluctuating interface in the middle of the film ( as shown in the upper part of fig .",
    "2 ) has been experimentally observed @xcite , and we consider it likely that by fine - tuning of experimental control parameters it should also be possible to observe some of the transitions predicted in figs .  1 , 2 .",
    "in fact , for polymers one need not have special interactions to get a first - order wetting transition as in the ising model @xcite , rather one finds always first order wetting behavior except close to the critical point of the bulk @xcite .    as in our previous work @xcite",
    "we consider a situation where the wetting transition temperature @xmath2 lies in the strong segregation regime , for which the self - consistent field theory is accurate .",
    "the technical aspects of this approach are explained in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "3 shows that for a typical choice of parameters indeed a phase diagram of the type of fig .  1",
    ", right part , is reproduced .",
    "note that the self - consistent field theory near the critical points @xmath72 , @xmath73 implies mean - field like behavior , @xmath74 , rather than yielding the expected two - dimensional ising exponent @xcite .",
    "but for large molecular weight this ising like critical region is expected to be rather narrow @xcite , and thus we consider fig .  3 as a useful hint for the phase diagram to be searched for in the experiments .",
    "in this paper we have considered the problem of phase - separating binary mixtures confined between ",
    "competing walls  and have shown by qualitative considerations ( fig.1 . ) and self  consistent field calculations ( fig.3 . ) that the phase diagram has either critical points and first order regions coexisting at a triple line or a single critical point resulting from the merging of these two critical points at the tricritical thickness @xmath75 . in previous work treating the case @xmath20 , only the case @xmath31 in the semi - grandcanonical ensemble was studied @xcite , which in the @xmath76 plane means that one cools the system at @xmath77 and then a single first order transition ( fig .  2 , left part )",
    "occurs : thus the existence of the two critical points was not previously discussed .",
    "of course , in reality one will have to abandon the special symmetry assumptions used in figs .  1 - 3",
    ", allowing for asymmetric mixtures , differences in strength of the wall forces , etc , and thus the space of parameters to be considered gets much enlarged .",
    "however , as long as one works in the subspace where the wetting transition temperatures @xmath2 of both walls are the same , the phase diagrams still should have the topology of fig .  1 ,",
    "only the mirror symmetry around @xmath78 or @xmath79 is lost , and thus in general @xmath80 will differ from @xmath81 .",
    "also @xmath54 and @xmath56 will differ .",
    "of course , in the most general case one must allow also for @xmath82 , different wetting transition temperatures of both walls .",
    "one can also consider first order wetting at one wall and second order wetting at the other .",
    "a description of the phase diagrams for these more complicated cases is a challenging task for future work .                                              for a much more detailed account of our calculations ,",
