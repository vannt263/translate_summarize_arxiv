    "ngc 4631 is one of the best examples of a nearby edge - on galaxy with a star formation driven outflow resulting in a bright and extended gaseous halo .",
    "this is seen in many tracers : h@xmath3 ( rand , kulkarni , & hester 1992 ; hoopes , walterbos , & rand 1999 ) , radio continuum ( e.g. ekers & sancisi 1977 ; hummel & dettmar 1990 ; golla & hummel 1994 ) , and x - rays ( wang et al . 1995 ; vogler & pietsch 1996 ) .",
    "this galaxy is undergoing interactions with two companions , ngc 4627 and ngc 4656 , and shows a complex pattern of tidal features seen in hi ( weliachew , sancisi , & gulin 1978 ; rand 1994 ) , and more recently to a lesser extent in cold dust ( neininger & dumke 1999 ) .",
    "it also shows two large and highly energetic hi supershells ( rand & van der hulst 1993 ) , the origin of which is not clear ( rand & stone 1996 ; loeb & perna 1998 ) .",
    "the disturbances to the disk resulting from the interactions may have caused the rather high level of star formation [ @xmath4 ergs s@xmath5 , uncorrected for internal extinction ( rand , kulkarni & hester 1992 ) ] .",
    "the above - mentioned gaseous halos are particularly bright above the central 4 kpc of the disk , where almost all of the @xmath6co @xmath0 emission is found ( golla & wielebinski 1994 ; hereafter gw ) .",
    "the co observations show a rigidly rotating inner disk with a total molecular mass of @xmath7 m@xmath8 . whether the inner 4-kpc structure might be a bar is a subject of debate ( e.g. roy , wang , & arsenault 1991 ; gw ) .",
    "it is conceivable that the interactions have driven much of the dense ism into the central regions of the galaxy , providing the fuel for the strong star formation activity .",
    "ngc 4631 provides us with an excellent opportunity to study star formation , galaxy interactions , possible radial inflows , and the production of gaseous halos , and thus deserves continued investigation .",
    "therefore , to probe further the structure and kinematics of the central concentration of dense gas , we have observed it in the @xmath6co @xmath0 line with the berkeley - illinois - maryland array ( bima ) .",
    "the data were taken in september 1995 in the c configuration of the bima array , with baselines ranging from 12 to 52 m. a single track was obtained , with an approximate on - source integration time of five hours .",
    "the primary beam of the antennae is 100  at the 2.6 mm wavelength of the @xmath6co @xmath0 transition .",
    "the quasar 3c273 was used for flux calibration .",
    "while observing ngc 4631 , pointing was switched every 50 seconds between two positions with offsets of 25  east and 15  west of a position near the radio nucleus [ r.a .",

    "calibration , mapping , and cleaning were carried out with the miriad package ( sault et al .",
    "1995 ) , using the mosaic option in the program invert to create a mosaic dirty map of the two fields .",
    "the emission was bright enough to allow self - calibration to be performed . for each pointing a clean map",
    "was initially produced and used as a model in the miriad program selfcal. the self - calibrated @xmath13-data were then used to create a new clean map , which became the new model for the next iteration .",
    "convergence was achieved after four iterations .",
    "the clean beam has dimensions 9.8x6.7 ",

    "the noise in the final channel maps is 130 mjy ( beam)@xmath5 or 0.2 k. a total intensity map was formed from emission in the range @xmath14 km",

    "figure 1 shows the map of total co intensity , including the fwhm of the primary beam for the two pointings , while figure 2 shows the same map overlaid on h@xmath3 and red - continuum ccd images from rand , kulkarni , & hester ( 1992 ) .",
    "some emission at the western end of the co distribution is beyond the fwhm of the western primary beam and may not be real or accurately mapped .",
    "other isolated features above the plane which reach only the first contour level ( 2@xmath15 ) are not significant enough to be considered real .",
    "position - velocity diagrams parallel to the major axis of the galaxy are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the major axis position angle of 86@xmath17 is the large - scale value derived from hi data ( rand 1994 ) .    the basic co structure and kinematics of the central region",
    "have been analyzed in detail by gw ; hence , we only briefly discuss them here , and focus on the small - scale features revealed by the high resolution (  3.2 ) .",
    "the emission shows a continuous structure with maxima at either end .",
    "the central minimum is at the position of the hi kinematic center ( rand 1994 ) .",
    "the brightening towards the far ends of these features is consistent with previous single - dish observations ( gw ; sofue et al .",
    "1990 ; sofue , handa , & nakai 1989 ) , and suggests a ring or bar - like structure of length @xmath1 4 kpc .",
    "the spectra of gw show that the emission falls off sharply beyond the radius of this structure .",
    "the `` bend '' noted by gw is even more noticeable here : the eastern half is elongated along a position angle @xmath18 while the position angle of the western half is @xmath19 .",
    "in this way , the central region reflects the well - known overall bend of the galaxy .",
    "this bend causes an exaggeration of the e - w asymmetry of the emission in the position - velocity ( @xmath20 ) diagrams : with the northern ( southern ) slices showing brighter emission from the eastern ( western ) end .",
    "the midplane @xmath20 diagram indicates rigid rotation with a slope of 1.9 km s@xmath5 arcsec@xmath5 , in agreement with the slope measured from the co 21 map of gw .",
    "velocities reach about 130 km s@xmath5 from the systemic velocity .",
    "the bright concentration at the eastern end of the emission shows a two - peaked velocity profile in a few cuts in figure 3 .",
    "the concentration at the western end does not show a clear bifurcation , but the velocity width is relatively large , similar to the eastern concentration .",
    "these kinematics could be due to localized events ( see  3.2 ) , or they may indicate non - circular motions . in particular , at the ends of a bar , gas streaming nearly perpendicular to the bar  on nearly circular orbits where the spiral pattern begins ",
    "may run into gas streaming along the bar ( e.g. regan , vogel , & teuben 1997 ) , creating a shock ( see also roberts , huntley , & van albada 1979 ) or at least orbit crowding .",
    "the co velocity field at the transition between the bar and the spiral arms in m83 has been interpreted in this way ( kenney & lord 1991 ) .",
    "this flow convergence may lead to bright regions of star formation , as observed at the ends of many bars , although more often in sbb galaxies ( phillips 1993 ) .",
    "a high level of star formation at this co peak is indicated by bright h@xmath3 , x - ray and radio continuum emission , as discussed in  3.2 .    against the bar hypothesis",
    "is the fact that nothing else in the @xmath20 diagram strongly suggests a bar , such as the expected `` parallelogram '' appearance of the emission due to @xmath21 orbits parallel to the bar potential ( binney et al .",
    "this conclusion was also reached by gw . only for a bar viewed side - on do",
    "the @xmath21 orbits occupy a narrow locus in @xmath20 diagrams ( see figure 8 of garca - burillo & gulin 1995 ) . in support of such a perspective",
    "is that ngc 4631 has one of the most slowly rising co rotation curves of the 14 galaxies studied by sofue et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , as might be expected for a side - on view of a bar .",
    "however , the low slope of the rotation curve could simply be due to the almost complete lack of a visible bulge .",
    "furthermore , there is no indication of gas on @xmath22 orbits perpendicular to the bar , deep in the potential ( cf .",
    "figure 1 of binney et al . 1991 ) .",
    "these are particularly noticeable in side - on views",
    ". a lack of molecular gas in the inner parts of the bar could be responsible .",
    "alternatively , the bar may not have an ilr ( e.g. athanassoula 1992 ) .",
    "for the modeled hi rotation curve of rand ( 1994 ) , this would imply a bar pattern speed of @xmath23 km s@xmath5 kpc@xmath5 .",
    "hence , a bar can not be ruled out but there is little evidence to support anything more complex than a ring structure .",
    "nevertheless , even a ring may represent a resonant response to a bar potential , but again there is little supporting evidence for a bar , particularly in the stellar emission ( see below ) .",
    "there may still be lower - level non - circular motions , however , given that slightly non - axisymmetric bulges are common in spirals ( zaritsky & lo 1986 ) , and given the many other disturbances to this galaxy .",
    "hi data in this central region show a rise in velocity very similar to the co data , but no evidence of a central minimum .",
    "it is more difficult to discern a bar in the hi data because of confusion with the larger , differentially - rotating disk .",
    "there is evidence of broadened velocity profiles in the central 4. the model hi cube of rand ( 1994 ) featured a velocity dispersion dictated by the rate of falloff of emission at the terminal velocity in the differentially rotating component .",
    "this choice produced generally broader profiles than observed in the central 4 , most likely indicating non - circular motions , but whether they are due to an inner bar or to spiral structure can not be determined .",
    "the disturbed optical appearance in the central regions , the lack of a discernable bulge , and the lack of near - ir imaging of this galaxy make it difficult to appeal to the stellar distribution to aid in discerning a bar .",
    "such a structure might be inferred from a boxy or peanut - shaped bulge , as in , for example , ngc 4013 , where the co distribution clearly shows evidence for bar - driven orbits ( garca - burillo , combes , & neri 1999 ) . in ngc 4631",
    ", the central regions in the red image ( figure 2b ) show a very irregular morphology , due to some combination of irregular stellar and dust distributions .",
    "the central regions of ngc 4631 have been recently mapped in submillimeter continuum emission by three different groups ( braine et al .",
    "1995 ; alton , davies , & bianchi 1999 ; neininger & dumke 1995 ) .",
    "the co map in general resembles these maps rather well in that they all show a central structure of about 4 kpc extent with emission enhancements near the ends .",
    "the prominent extraplanar feature seen in the 1.3 mm continuum map of braine et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , extending about 1 southward of the eastern complex , is not seen in co. it is not likely to have been resolved out , since essentially all of its structure is on scales to which the co map is sensitive . using the conversion of 1.3 mm surface brightness to gas mass given by braine et al .",
    ", the typical gas surface density in this filament should be of order 200 m@xmath8 pc@xmath24 .",
    "if all of this gas were molecular and detectable in co , we should expect emission in our map at a typical level of 30 jy ( beam)@xmath5 km s@xmath5 , or 6@xmath15 .",
    "this is clearly not seen .",
    "possibilities are that the dust is associated with hi gas , the gas to dust ratio is much lower in ngc 4631 , any molecular gas in the spur is too cold to emit substantially in the co lines , or the emission is spurious . for the main central 2 feature at least , the agreement of the derived mass with the total hi+h@xmath25 mass is better than a factor of 2 ( braine et al . ) , suggesting that the essential conversion from 1.3 mm emission to total gas mass is reasonably accurate .",
    "it is difficult to extend this conclusion to the high-@xmath26 gas , however .",
    "more relevant is that the feature is not seen in the 1.2 mm map of neininger & dumke ( 1999 ) , which has very similar resolution and sensitivity",
    ". it may well be spurious .",
    "on the other hand , the beginnings of the loop south of the nucleus in braine et al.s map coincide with a co spur extending south from the western half of the emission ; these in turn may be associated with an extraplanar h@xmath3 feature ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the 850 @xmath27 m continuum map of alton et al .",
    "( 1999 ) also shows extraplanar emission just south of this co spur .",
    "the 1.4 ghz map of golla ( 1999 ) at 1.45  resolution shows much agreement with the co distribution on scales of a few arcseconds , including bright concentrations coincident with the two co peaks at each end of the main structure , and a relative deficit of emission between them .",
    "earlier radio maps also show a concentration of synchrotron emission in the central 4 kpc of the disk ( e.g. ekers & sancisi 1977 , duric et al .",
    "1982 ; golla & hummel 1994 ) .",
    "most of the diffuse extraplanar h@xmath3 emission ( figure 2 ; see also hoopes , walterbos , & rand 1999 ) is found above and below the 4-kpc extent of the co emission .",
    "the quasi - vertical double - worm structure reported by rkh does not rise from the center of the co structure but from a position about 700 pc to the east .",
    "diffuse , soft x - ray halo emission generally surrounds the inner disk and is brightest in the approximate radial range of the co emission , as seen in the overlay of the rosat pspc map from vogler & pietsch ( 1996 ) , kindly provided by a. vogler , and the co map in figure 4a ( see also wang et al .",
    "finally , bright polarized emission at 4.88 and 8.46 ghz is found in the halo above this region of the disk , where the inferred intrinsic magnetic field runs largely perpendicular to the major axis ( golla & hummel 1994 ) .",
    "all of these associations suggest active star formation and outflow of gas into the halo .",
    "all three halo tracers are brighter on the north side of the co emission than the south side .    assuming a conversion between co brightness and h@xmath25 column density of @xmath28 , the total molecular mass detected is @xmath29 m@xmath8 . within the uncertainties",
    ", this value agrees with the estimate of gw for the central 140  ( using the same value of @xmath30 ) , suggesting that little , if any , emission has been resolved out by our observations .",
    "the most important new result from this observation is the filamentary and shell - like emission found north of the eastern end of the main co feature .",
    "a weaker feature is also seen to the south .",
    "the extraplanar emission is detected up to 750 pc above the midplane of the co distribution .",
    "although the galaxy is not quite edge - on , it is unlikely that the feature is in the plane of the galaxy . at @xmath31 , it would have to extend about 10 kpc along the midplane to explain the apparent extent parallel to the minor axis .",
    "also , kinematically , in a highly inclined , differentially rotating disk , one would expect the feature to show a smooth gradient towards lower observed velocities with increasing distance from the major axis if it were in the disk .",
    "although its kinematics are complex ( see below ) , it does not show such a signature .",
    "the mass of the feature is estimated at roughly 10@xmath32 m@xmath8 , using the above value of @xmath30 .",
    "it splits into a quasi - linear feature on the west side , rising to the north - west , and a more shell - like feature on the east side , suggesting that it may have been produced by two events .",
    "figure 5 shows position - velocity diagrams parallel to the r.a .",
    "axis in the region of this feature , covering its full vertical extent .",
    "the disk emission below the feature is the brightest in the map and kinematically splits into two components , as discussed above , with the lower velocity component deviating somewhat from the general trend of velocity with position . just to the east of the bright disk feature , most of the emission centers around @xmath33 km s@xmath5 ,",
    "while fainter emission is seen at @xmath34 km s@xmath5 ( more apparent in the @xmath35 panel ) .",
    "velocities in the western , filamentary component of the extraplanar feature ( best seen in the 12 , 15 and 18  panels at r.a .",
    "offsets around 12  ) center around @xmath36 km s@xmath5 , a typical velocity for its distance along the major axis , and no clear trend of velocity with position can be identified as a clue to its nature . however , in the eastern extraplanar feature ( around r.a .",
    "offset 12  ) , the two disk components at @xmath33 km s@xmath5 and @xmath34 km s@xmath5 are seen up to the 15  panel ( also to the 6  panel ) .",
    "this velocity splitting may indicate a structure expanding at @xmath37 km s@xmath5 .",
    "given that the eastern feature accounts for slightly more than half the emission , the equivalent kinetic energy of a spherically expanding shell would be enormous : @xmath38 erg , comparable to the two hi supershells .",
    "on the other hand , there are other possible sources of peculiar kinematics at this radius , as discussed above , and the line splitting may have an orbital origin , although the evidence is inconclusive .",
    "another indication of the energy involved in creating such an outflow comes from an estimate of the potential energy of the gas mass at its height above the plane .",
    "this has been estimated for several dust clouds above the disk of ngc 891 by howk & savage ( 1997 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the estimate depends on the rather poorly known total midplane mass density and scale height .",
    "the potential energy is given by : @xmath39\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the total mass scale height , @xmath41 is the total midplane mass density and @xmath42 is the mass of the high-@xmath26 feature . the @xmath43band scale - height has been determined by hummel & dettmar ( 1990 ) to be about 1 kpc .",
    "this may be a poor estimate of the true mass scale height , which itself could vary significantly around this disturbed galaxy",
    ". however , use of this value should still give a rough estimate of the energies involved .",
    "the total mass density is unknown but presumably less than in ngc 891 or the milky way given the low rotation speed of 140 km s@xmath5 ( rand 1994 ) .",
    "using the above molecular gas mass and an average height above the plane of 500 pc , the potential energy is then @xmath44 comparable to the kinetic energy estimate .",
    "of course , this analysis does not account for energy radiated away or converted to thermal or turbulent motions .",
    "the bright disk emission below this feature abuts the western edge of the very bright complex of hii regions cm65 , cm66 , and cm67 ( crillon & monnet 1969 ; roy et al .",
    "1991 ) , suggesting a region of intense star formation .",
    "in fact , the eastern , shell - like extraplanar feature almost appears to surround the peak of h@xmath3 ( and associated red continuum ) emission ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the h@xmath3 luminosity from this complex , measured from the image of rand , kulkarni , & hester ( 1992 ) , is @xmath45 erg s@xmath5 ( uncorrected for extinction ) , about equal to that of 30 doradus in the lmc ( kennicutt & hodge 1986 ) .",
    "roy et al .",
    "( 1991 ) noted a complex velocity structure for these hii regions , with components at @xmath46 = 641 , 687 , and 753 km s@xmath5 .",
    "thus , both co and h@xmath3 emission show a large range of velocities , and there is some correlation of these components between the two tracers .",
    "of course , it must be recalled that the disk emission may have a significant extent along the line of sight ( for instance if it is part of a ring viewed along the tangent point ) , and this may explain , at least in part , why it is so bright in several ism tracers .",
    "there are no well - defined _ extraplanar _",
    "h@xmath3 features which are associated with the co emission .",
    "in particular , the double - worm structure lies between this co structure and the center of the molecular ring .",
    "it may originate from a star - forming complex elsewhere on the ring .",
    "x - rays from this part of the disk provide further evidence for a high rate of star formation .",
    "figure 4b shows the co emission with contours of x - ray emission from the `` adaptive - filtered '' rosat hri ( 0.12.4 kev ) image of vogler & pietsch ( 1996 ) .",
    "the filtering technique smooths the original hri image with a kernel whose size depends on the image intensity , thus enhancing low - level diffuse emission while retaining high resolution for bright , compact features .",
    "no x - ray feature can be specifically associated with the molecular outflow , but the bright concentration of disk co emission beneath it is coincident within the positional uncertainties with the brightest peak of x - ray emission in the inner disk .",
    "this source has a luminosity , corrected for galactic absorption , of @xmath47 erg s@xmath5 ( 0.12.4 kev ) , and is too weak to obtain a spectrum .",
    "this luminosity is a lower limit due to unaccounted for absorption in ngc 4631 , and is comparable to those of the x - ray sources in m101 postulated to be hypernova remnants by wang ( 1999 ) .",
    "coincident with these disk co and x - ray sources is a bright source of radio emission in golla s ( 1999 ) 1.4 ghz map at 1.45  .",
    "this source resolves into five features in a 4.86 ghz map at sub - arcsecond resolution , four of which have thermal spectra .",
    "golla & hummel ( 1994 ) trace one of the radio continuum spurs back down to the cm67 region in the disk .",
    "none of the extraplanar emission from cold dust found by neininger & dumke ( 1999 ) appears to be associated with the co feature .",
    "examination of the hi data cube of ngc 4631 at 12x22  ( rand 1994 ) shows no obvious associated kinematic or morphological peculiarities .",
    "hence , there is much evidence for a very intense region of star formation at in this disk location , and an extraplanar radio continuum filament also seems to be associated with the co feature .",
    "it is difficult to conclude much about the origin of this feature at this point .",
    "if the kinetic energy is of order 10@xmath2 ergs , then it may be difficult to explain it as a result of stellar winds and supernovae , as was the case for the two large hi supershells ( rand & van der hulst 1993 ) .",
    "one would require of order 10,000 supernova progenitors .",
    "alternatively , it may be due to the impact of a rather massive high - velocity cloud , an explanation considered by rand & stone ( 1996 ) for the hi supershells ( there , an impactor of about 10@xmath48 m@xmath8 was required ) .",
    "the impact may have triggered the star formation in the disk at this location . in this case",
    ", the x - ray emission would be due to the resulting supernovae , as the collision itself would not be able to heat gas to x - ray emitting temperatures .",
    "an examination of the hi data of rand ( 1994 ) does not reveal any obvious signs of an impact at this location , such as a trail of gas .",
    "finally , there is the newly recognized possibility that such shells can be produced by a single energetic explosion  a hypernova , which may be the cause of gamma - ray bursts ( e.g. loeb & perna 1998 ; efremov , elmegreen , & hodge 1998 ; wang 1999 ) . at best ,",
    "it is difficult to distinguish between putative hypernovae and conventional supernova - driven supershells , and in this case especially so , given the difficulty of disentangling emission along the line of sight , correcting x - ray fluxes for absorption in the intervening gas , and determining the age of the high-@xmath26 structure .",
    "however , it is worth noting that this is now the third problematically energetic event found in this galaxy",
    ". this may provide constraints on the hypernova hypothesis .",
    "whether these events occur because of hypernovae , or multiple supernovae and stellar winds from massive star formation concentrated into unusually large associations , or a few relatively massive high - velocity clouds penetrating the disk , can only be answered by future investigation .",
    "the co emission from the feature reported here is bright enough to allow a higher resolution map to be made .",
    "such a map may provide a clearer delineation of its morphology and kinematics , allowing a more careful comparison with models of its origin .",
    "also chandra , with its higher resolution compared to rosat , may constrain the nature of the x - ray emission by showing whether it remains diffuse on smaller scales or breaks up into multiple components , and also by allowing a measurement of the gas temperature .",
    "in this brief paper we have presented a high - resolution map of the centrally concentrated co emission in ngc 4631 .",
    "the map confirms the ring or bar - like distribution of molecular gas inferred from single - dish data , but there is little direct evidence for a bar . halo emission in several gaseous tracers",
    "is concentrated above , and to a lesser extent , below , this molecular structure , suggesting that the central concentration of molecular gas has provided the fuel for intense star formation which has resulted in a substantial outflow of gas .    of great interest",
    "is an extraplanar co feature found above the eastern end of the molecular structure .",
    "it suggests an outflow of about @xmath49 m@xmath8 of molecular gas , although there is only weak evidence for an associated kinematic signature . nevertheless , the energies involved in driving the outflow may be well over 10@xmath2 ergs .",
    "bright hii regions and x - ray emission suggest that the underlying disk location is very active in star formation .",
    "an extraplanar radio continuum filament also appears to have a footprint in this region . like the two highly energetic hi supershells in this galaxy",
    ", this outflow may be driven by multiple supernovae or is perhaps the result of an impact of a high - velocity cloud .",
    "its characteristics also put it in the class of events postulated to be due to hypernova explosions .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration ."
