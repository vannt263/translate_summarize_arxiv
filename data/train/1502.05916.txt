    "the determining properties of the quality of permanent magnet materials are the operating temperature range and , primarily , the energy product . in terms of operating temperature range",
    ", it depends on particular applications , but mostly we demand that the material remains magnetic well above room temperature . for the energy product ,",
    "we generally require it to be as large as possible .",
    "energy product is a relatively complex quantity ; it depends on the structure of the material ( size of crystalline grains , their shape and orientation ) , but from the microscopic point of view it depends mainly on the saturation magnetization @xmath8 and magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy ( mae ) , which is a measure of how difficult it is to rotate the magnetization direction by external magnetic field@xcite .",
    "the best permanent magnet materials known today are typically utilizing rare - earth elements , most notably , neodymium in nd@xmath2fe@xmath9b and samarium in smco@xmath10 magnets . both exhibit high curie temperatures and large energy products . recently , however , the availability ( and thus price ) of the rare - earth elements became rather volatile , calling for development of replacement materials , which would use less or none of the rare - earth elements .",
    "intense research efforts have started worldwide , revisiting previously known materials , such as fe@xmath2p@xcite , feni@xcite or fe@xmath11n@xmath12 @xcite , doing computational data mining among the large family of heusler alloys @xcite , exploring the effects of strain @xcite and doping by interstitial elements @xcite , multilayers such as fe / w - re@xcite , or as a limiting case of multilayers , the l@xmath13 family of compounds @xcite , or promising mn - based systems @xcite , among others .    in this work",
    "we explore the magnetic properties of the ( fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2b alloys . in 1970 the magnetic properties of these compounds",
    "have been experimentally studied by iga@xcite , later by coene et al.@xcite and very recently by kuzmin et al.@xcite .",
    "it was found that within a certain range of co contents the material exhibits uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy , with a relatively large mae , significantly higher than pure iron or even cobalt elemental metals . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "theoretical understanding of the observations is missing .",
    "moreover , motivated by the works of andersson @xcite and bhandary @xcite , we have attempted to further improve the mae of the ( fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2b materials by doping them with 5@xmath5 transition metal elements .",
    "the mentioned works have shown that the hybridization of the exchange - split 3@xmath5 bands of fe or co with the 5@xmath5 bands of heavier transition metal elements may lead to a significant enhancement of the mae , even if the 5@xmath5 element itself is non - magnetic or very weakly magnetic .",
    "we have thus considered low percentage substitutions of fe or co by the whole series of 5@xmath5 transition metal elements and computationally explored the effect of the substitutions on the mae .",
    "together with the first principles electronic structure calculations we have performed experimental studies of ( fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2b alloys for selected co concentrations and at the optimal concentration in terms of maximal mae , we have synthesized single crystals with 2.5  at.% of selected 5@xmath5 elements alloyed on the 3@xmath5 site . for these single crystals",

    "different computational models are compared and the importance of correlation effects are discussied .",
    "furthermore , we relate the mae to the electronic band structure around the fermi energy ( e@xmath14 ) since it is well known that the mae in @xmath5-electron systems is determined by the electronic structure close to e@xmath14@xcite and in particular by the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) between occupied and unoccupied states with small difference in energy .",

    "several single crystals of ( fe@xmath0co@xmath15)@xmath2b were grown as part of this work . the first stage consisted in melting a mixture of fe and co ( both 99.99% pure ) with crystalline b of 99.999% purity .",
    "the melting was performed in alumina crucibles placed in an induction furnace under a gauge pressure of 2 bars of pure argon . when we proceeded from the stoichiometric composition , the powder xrd patterns of ( fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2b alloys corresponded well to the cual@xmath2-type structure but the ingots also contained some precipitants ( 3 - 4 wt.% ) rich in the @xmath16 elements . to avoid the precipitants ,",
    "the starting mixture was taken with a 1.5  at.% excess of b ; the so obtained ingot appeared as single - phase in powder x - ray diffraction patterns and scanning electron microscope images .",
    "the ingots were subsequently remelted . for better homogeneity ,",
    "the melts were held for 5 minutes at 1425@xmath17c in an argon atmosphere .",
    "then the temperature was reduced slowly , at a rate of 0.1@xmath17c / min , down to 1100@xmath17c .",
    "at that point the power was switched off and the furnace quickly ( initially at approx .",

    "<S> we have explored , computationally and experimentally , the magnetic properties of ( fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2b alloys . </S>",
    "<S> calculations provide a good agreement with experiment in terms of the saturation magnetization and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy with some difficulty in describing co@xmath2b , for which it is found that both full potential effects and electron correlations treated within dynamical mean field theory are of importance for a correct description . </S>",
    "<S> the material exhibits a uniaxial magnetic anisotropy for a range of cobalt concentrations between @xmath3 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> a simple model for the temperature dependence of magnetic anisotropy suggests that the complicated non - monotonous temperature behaviour is mainly due to variations in the band structure as the exchange splitting is reduced by temperature . using density functional theory based calculations </S>",
    "<S> we have explored the effect of substitutional doping the transition metal sublattice by the whole range of 5@xmath5 transition metals and found that doping by re or w elements should significantly enhance the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , w doping did not succeed in enhancing the magnetic anisotropy due to formation of other phases . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> doping by ir and re was successful and resulted in magnetic anisotropies that are in agreement with theoretical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , doping by 2.5  at.% of re on the fe / co site shows a magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy which is increased by 50% compared to its parent ( fe@xmath6co@xmath7)@xmath2b compound , making this system interesting , for example , in the context of permanent magnet replacement materials or in other areas where a large magnetic anisotropy is of importance . </S>"
