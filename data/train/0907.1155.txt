    "blazars form a sub - group of radio loud agn showing extreme variability at all wavelengths , high degrees of linear polarization and strong gamma ray emission . they include bl lac objects as well as quasars with flat radio spectra .",
    "they show variability over a wide range of timescales both within a night and over longer terms .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain their variability ; the most commonly accepted one is the shock - in - jet model ( marscher & gear 1985 ) .",
    "alternative models that probably apply under specific circumstances involve interstellar scintillation ( rickett et al .",
    "2001 ) , microlensing ( schneider & weiss 1987 ) , accretion disk instabilities ( mangalam & wiita 1993 ; chakrabarti & wiita 1993 ) and binary black holes ( sillanpaa et al . 1988 ) .",
    "however , the mechanism responsible for variability is not yet known conclusively .",
    "although optical variability on intra - night timescales is now a well established phenomenon for blazars ( miller et al . 1989",
    "; carini et al . 1992 ; noble et al . 1997 ; stalin et al . 2005 ; sagar et al . 2004 ) , its relationship to long - term variability remains unclear .",
    "clues to this relationship could possibly come from monitoring the optical spectrum for correlation with brightness ( vagnetti et al .",
    "this will also enable better discrimination among the various models proposed for flux variability in blazars .",
    "since the early times of bl lac research , a correlation between spectral slope and source intensity has been searched for ( gear et al .",
    "several authors have studied the relationship of spectral changes to flux variations over the recent years ( takalo & sillanpaa 1989 ; damicis et al .",
    "2002 ; vagnetti et al . 2003",
    "; fiorucci et al . 2004 ; foschini et al .",
    "2006 ; zheng et al .",
    "damicis et al .",
    "( 2002 ) reported that the spectra of all the eight bl lacs in their sample showed a bluer when brighter trend .",
    "similar results were obtained by fiorucci et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and gu et al .",
    "( 2006 ) also found that all the bl lacs in their sample tend to be bluer when brighter .",
    "however some blazars are found to show anomalous spectral behaviour ( ramirez et al .",
    "for example , pks 0736 + 017 showed a tendency for its spectrum to become redder when brighter both on inter - night and intra - night timescales .",
    "gu et al . ( 2006 ) found two of their three fsqsr to be redder when they are brighter .",
    "villata et al . (",
    "2006 ) reported that the fsqsr 3c 454.3 generally had the redder when brighter behaviours during the 2004@xmath42005 outburst .",
    "no bluer when brighter trend was noticed either on intra - night or inter - night timescales for s5 0716 + 714 ( stalin et al .",
    "2006 ) , whereas bl lac showed a bluer when brighter trend on intra - night intervals and a similar trend ( although of less significance ) on inter - night timescales ( stalin et al . 2006 ; papadakis et al . 2007 ) .",
    "it is generally considered that the optical spectral index variability and the bluer when brighter trend are common for bl lac objects ( gu et al .",
    "2006 ; papadakis et al .",
    "nevertheless , it is currently not clear if this trend is universal in blazars as some flat spectrum quasars show the opposite behaviour .",
    "this bluer when brighter trend could be easily explained if the luminosity increase was due to the injection of fresh electrons with an energy distribution harder than that of previously partially cooled ones ( kirk et al .",
    "1998 ; mastichiadis & kirk 2002 ) .",
    "a second explanation for that trend posits short term fluctuations of only the electron injection spectral index ( bottcher & reimer 2004 ) .",
    "as blazars are variable in timescales as short as minutes , the colour variations of blazars available in the literature all of which are based on quasi - simultaneous multi - band monitoring have relatively less utility than those obtained by simultaneous multiband monitoring .",
    "thus there is a need to have simultaneous monitoring observations of a sample of blazars to really resolve the bluer when brighter / redder when brighter issue .",
    "here we report new observations on the blazar s5 0716 + 714 , which is one of the most studied sources for variability across the electromagnetic spectrum ( wagner et al . 1996 ; kraus et al . 2003 ; bach et al 2005 ; bach et al .",
    "this blazar also has been observed repeatedly in various multifrequency campaigns ( wagner et al .",
    "1990 ; wagner et al .",
    "1996 ; tagliaferri et al .",
    "2003 ; raiteri et al .",
    "2003 ) and is known to be extremely variable ( @xmath3hours to months at radio and x - ray bands ) . in the optical s5 0716 + 714",
    "is identified as a bl lac but with an unknown redshift .",
    "a redshift of z@xmath5 0.3 was deduced using the limits on the surface brightness of the host galaxy ( quirrenbach et al .",
    "1991 ; stickel et al .",
    "1993 ; sbarufatti et al .",
    "nilsson et al .",

    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 discusses the observations and reductions .",
    "the analysis of the data is detailed in section 3 and the results are given in the final section .",
    "observations were carried out using the mitsume 3 band ( @xmath7 ) simultaneous imager on the 50 cm telescope at the okayama astrophysical observatory ( kotani et al .",
    "observations were done over a total of 30 nights with duration of observations ranging from 1 to 6 hours .",
    "mitsume has three dichroic mirrors to divide the incident beam into three ones .",
    "it has been known that these dichroic mirrors ( inclined to the incident beam by 45 degrees ) produces instrumental polarization of , at most , @xmath8% , @xmath9% and @xmath10% at @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 bands , respectively .",
    "this gives a photometric uncertainty up to @xmath14% , @xmath15% and @xmath16% , respectively , where @xmath17 is the degree of the intrinsic polarization of the object .",
    "however , the observed polarization of s5  0716 + 714 during the observation period was @xmath18 ( mahito sasada et al . , private communication )",
    "and thus the estimated error is negligibly small , @xmath19 mag even in @xmath13 band .    [ cols= \" <",

    "the presence or absence of a bluer when brighter trend in blazars on inter - night and intra - night timescales can provide interesting clues to the origin of blazar activity from hour like to much longer timescale .",
    "such a study on the spectral variability in blazars also will help to constrain various models proposed for blazar activity .",
    "this relationship between the optical spectral variability and brightness variations in blazars have been investigated by many authors ( speziali & natali 1998 ; papadakis et al .",
    "2003 ; raiteri et al .",
    "2003 ; villata et al . 2004 ; wu et a. 2005 ; stalin et al .",
    "the results of such studies are contrary to each other . to address this issue ,",
    "we have presented here high temporal resolution , simultaneous @xmath7 band photometric monitoring observations of the blazar s5 0716 + 714 on 30 nights between 11 march 2008 and 8 may 2008 .",
    "the results of our observations are summarized as follows    1 .",
    "the object was active during our whole monitoring period and showed variability both on intra - night and inter - night timescales . during individual nights ,",
    "the amplitude of variability ranges from 4% to 55% .",
    "on inter - night timescale , the source has * shown * a variability as large as 80% during the whole monitoring period 2 .",
    "of the 22 nights considered for inov , the object showed variability on 19 nights with an estimated duty cycle of variability of 83% .",
    "the amplitide of * variability * was found to be larger toward shorter wavelengths , both on inter - night and intra - night timescales 3 .   on the nights the object showed inov ,",
    "the timescale of variability was found to be between * 0.1 * hr and 5.3 hrs . also on 9 nights evidence for quasi - periods",
    "were found with periods ranging from 0.9 to 4.3 hrs .",
    "clear evidence for periodic variations with a period of 3.3 hrs was found on 1 april 2008 .",
    "a second possible periodic variation with period of 4.0 hrs was found on 31 march 2008 .",
    "no evidence for time lag was found between @xmath0 and @xmath2 bands on most of the nights , except for three nights , when the @xmath0 band was found to lead the @xmath2 band with durations from 0.3 to 1.6 hrs .",
    "however , on inter - night timescales , no time lag was found between @xmath0 and @xmath2 bands .",
    "the object showed clear colour variation , in the sense the object became bluer when brighter on both intra - night and inter - night timescales .",
    "* several models have been proposed to explain the flux variability in blazars .",
    "they are broadly grouped into two categories namely intrinsic and extrinsic .",
    "models invoking extrinsic mechanisms as the cause of variability include interstellar scintillation ( rickett et al .",
    "2001 ) and gravitational microlensing ( schneider & weiss 1987 ; gopal - krishna & subramanian 1991 ) .",
    "interstellar scintillation can be active at low radio freqencies as it is highly frequency dependent .",
    "the optical inov seen in s5 0716 + 714 can not thus be caused by interstellar scintillation .",
    "gravitational microlensing results in symmetric lightcurves and is also an achromatic process .",
    "the clear bluer when brighter chromatism seen in s5 0716 + 714 both on inter - night and intra - night timescales is thus not due to microlensing .",
    "these observations as well as the close correlations between the optical and radio bands seen in s5 0716 + 714 ( quirrenbach et al .",
    "1991 ) argues strongly against an extrinsic origin of variability .",
    "the two other major classes of models for intrinsic origin of agn variability are those involving accrection disk instabilities ( mangalam & wiita 1993 ) and those involving shocks in relativistic jets ( marscher & gear 1985 ) .",
    "the shock - in - jet model is the most commonly used model to explain variability in blazars where relativistic jets are present . in this model time lag between various wavelength bands are expected . in our observations",
    "no evidence of a lag between @xmath0 and @xmath2 bands was found on most of the nights .",
    "this might be due to the poor quality of the @xmath0 band data compared to the @xmath2 band for correlation analysis .",
    "investigations on flux variability on blazar sources , have revealed evidence of periodicity in different timescales in few cases ( gupta et al .",
    "2009 ; carrasco et al .",
    "1985 ; carini et al . 1992 ; stalin et al .",
    "2005 , wu et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the detection of quasi - periodicity or periodicity on intra - night timescales can be most explained by accretion disk based models ( mangalam & wiita ; chakrabarti & wiita 1993 ; espailat et al .",
    "2008 ) . in the context of shock - in - jet model too , periodicity in blazar lightcurves can be of geometrical origin namely orbital motion in a binary black - hole system , jet precession and jet rotation ( reiger 2004 ; camenzind & krockenberger 1992 ; gopal - krishna & wiita 1992 ) and their variations are achromatic ( wu et al . 2005 ) . in our observations on the nights when quasi - periodicities were found and on the two nights when clear sinusoidal variations were found , the variations were highly chromatic .",
    "the presence of spectral variations thus imply that the observed variations are not caused by geometric effects .",
    "our observations on the variability in s5 0716 + 714 , the bluer when brighter trend and the increase of the amplitude of variability towards shorter wavelenghts appear to be more consistent in terms of shocks propagating in the relativistic jet of s5 0716 + 714 .",
    "recently dai et al .",
    "( 2009 ) noted that among blazars , bl lacs show a bluer when brighter trend whereas , fsqsrs show a redder when brighter trend .",
    "this might indicate the existence of different physical conditions in these two subclasses of blazars .",
    "further simultaneous observations of a matched sample of bl lacs and fsqsrs are needed to fully resolve the question of the ubiquity of the bluer when brighter trend in blazars*.",
