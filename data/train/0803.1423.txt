    "there are many aspects of qcd that are still lacking a satisfying understanding from first principles .",
    "one is the behavior in the regge limit , where the theory is expected to be better formulated in terms of new effective fields , the reggeized particles @xcite .",
    "one of the central building blocks of this reggeon field theory is the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) pomeron which comes as a bound state of two reggeized gluons with vacuum quantum numbers @xcite .",
    "while the original calculations were done in the leading logarithmic approximation ( lla ) , the requirement of high precision has led to the computation of subleading corrections ( nlo corrections ) to the bfkl equation @xcite , and they have been found to be large .",
    "while , for finite values of @xmath2 further steps beyond nlo will extend beyond the ladder structure and hence open the full complexity of reggeon field theory , there is evidence that the large-@xmath2 limit suppresses the transition from two to four reggeized gluons and thus allows , also beyond the nlo corrections , to stay within the ladder approximation .    beside its phenomenological relevance ,",
    "high energy physics has been a prolific source of theoretical cues . in the early days ,",
    "the proposal by veneziano @xcite of crossing - symmetric , regge behaved amplitude turned out to be a key point for the beginning of the string theory era . later on , in the early nineties ,",
    "when studying unitarity corrections to the bfkl pomeron , lipatov @xcite found the first occurrence of integrable structures in four dimensional quantum field theories : in the large-@xmath2 limit , the generalization of the bfkl evolution equation , the bartels - kwiecinski - praszalowicz ( bkp ) evolution equations @xcite for the @xmath3 gluon state , were found to be integrable .",
    "recently , the connection between quantum field theory and string theory was revived by the advent of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "this conjectured connection between yang - mills theories ( the maximally supersymmetric version of qcd , @xmath0 super yang - mills theory ( sym ) , at large @xmath2 , being the most attractive example ) and some string theory ( type iib on @xmath4 for the case just mentioned ) has motivated , among other directions of interest , also the analysis of the high energy limit in supersymmetric theories , in particular the bfkl pomeron @xcite and the vacuum singularity @xcite .",
    "on the gauge theory side , the most reliable environment of investigating the pomeron is provided by the scattering of electromagnetic currents , e.g. , the total cross section of the scattering of two virtual photons @xcite . in order to be able to define correlation functions that are defined on both the gauge theory and the string theory side , it has been suggested @xcite to use , as a substitute of the electromagnetic current , the @xmath1-currents belonging to the global @xmath5 of the @xmath0 sym theory . to be more precise ,",
    "one picks a @xmath6 subgroup of the @xmath5 group .",
    "it therefore seems natural to investigate four point correlators ( and even @xmath3 point correlators with @xmath7 ) of these @xmath1-current operators , representing correlation functions which are well - defined both on the gauge theory and the string theory side .",
    "whereas two point and three point correlators of the @xmath1-current operators have been studied before @xcite , an analysis of four point correlation functions has not yet been performed .    in this paper",
    "we address , within @xmath0 sym , the regge limit of @xmath1-current operators , beginning with the gauge theory side . in qcd",
    "it is well known that , in the high energy regge limit , the four point amplitude of the electromagnetic current factorizes into impact factors of the ( virtual ) photon and the bfkl green s function that describes the energy dependence . in this paper , as a start , we will verify that this expectation remains valid also for the supersymmetric extension , where scalar fields have to be included , and the fermions belong to the adjoint representation of the gauge group . since the @xmath1-currents are non - abelian , their associated ward identities are more complicated then in qed , and this causes some subtleties in the treatment of uv divergencies .",
    "we investigate the one - loop box diagrams and compute , in the leading logarithmic representation , the impact factors of the @xmath1-current .",
    "since , in the leading logarithmic approximation , the bfkl green s function remains the same as in the nonsupersymmetric case , we thus find the supersymmetric analog of the @xmath8 total cross section discussed in qcd . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we will turn to the dual analog on the string theory side where the graviton is expected to play the dominant role .",
    "the most convenient way of addressing regge dynamics in qcd is the study of the elastic scattering of two highly virtual photons .",
    "the large virtuality of the external photons provides hard scales that allow us to use perturbation theory .",
    "one focuses on the computation of the leading order in the electric charge @xmath9 , at which each photon splits into a quark - antiquark pair , but the order in the strong coupling constant @xmath10 can be arbitrary high .",
    "the decay of the photon is mediated by the electromagnetic current @xmath11 associated with the @xmath6 gauge symmetry of qed .",

    "it is convenient to compute the amplitude in terms of its projections onto the polarization vectors of the external photons .",
    "the reader is referred to the appendix [ app : sudakovandpol ] for the explicit definition of the polarization vectors in the regge limit .",
    "once they are defined , we can use their completeness in order to decompose the correlation function as @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the projections of @xmath14 onto the appropriate polarization vectors . in the following",
    "we will often suppress , for the scattering amplitude @xmath14 on the lhs , the tensor indices .",
