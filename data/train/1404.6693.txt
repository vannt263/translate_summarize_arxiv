    "arguably the most important water - soluble synthetic polymers,@xcite ( -ch@xmath1-o - ch@xmath1-)@xmath11 chain molecules are intrinsic to the dispersant materials applied to oil spills , @xcite and can be soluble also in organic solvents . with -h ( and thus methyl -ch@xmath0 )",
    "ends polyethylene oxide ( peo ) is a common name , and we will use that name generically when the chains have arbitrary capping groups . with hydroxyl -oh terminations these chains",
    "are typically called polyethylene glycol ( peg ) , and we will use that name in discussing experiments that study that case specifically .    for dispersants used on oil spills,@xcite and for other applications,@xcite peo chains are often decorated with junctions or tails or caps .",
    "correlations associated with capping groups then focus molecular structural analyses , molecular specificity in understanding loop closure being an outstanding interest.@xcite those correlations can be the targets of neutron scattering experiments@xcite with deuterated chains , under the important limitation of chemical feasibility of specific isotopic labeling for the caps .",
    "we have studied x(-ch@xmath1-o - ch@xmath1-)@xmath11x with a variety of capping groups x for just those reasons.@xcite capping groups can non - trivially change solution properties , particularly for the short - chain oligomers , and those changes have been of specific interest.@xcite    here we analyze the x = ch@xmath0 case . with this capping choice",
    ", neutron scattering experiments also characterize c - c contacts for c atoms closer along the chain contour than the end - caps , _",
    "i.e. , _ short - circuited loops contribute to those neutron scattering results .",
    "we utilize simulation results theoretically to investigate anticipated neutron scattering studies that interrogate loop - closure .",
    "we consider a structure factor model that spans small - angle and diffraction regimes , which thus highlights the molecular - scale features that might be sought .",
    "the structure factor model that we analyze assumes ideal gaussian chains , and is particularly simple .",
    "nevertheless , it is more complicated than the most traditional continuum - gaussian model , and the distinction is essential for the success of the model in these comparisons .",
    "we then further test other aspects of gaussian chain models against simulation results . since gaussian",
    "chain models are particularly simple , these alternative aspects are typically collective characteristics . though limited in molecular detail , collective characteristics have countervailing advantages of wide utility .",
    "initial examples include the probability distribution , @xmath12 , of the square radius of gyration , and then the @xmath13 for the @xmath9-th chain segment , contributing to the decomposition @xmath14    building from @xmath8 results , we consider density profiles of chain globules described by a gaussian chain model .",
    "our goal is to establish simple models that permit statistical thermodynamic evaluation of the surface tensions of aqueous electrolyte solutions with hydrocarbon liquids@xcite when dispersant materials are deployed . as an example of a specific characteristic that should be helpful , we note that the dielectric constant of aqueous peo solutions depends linearly on the water volume fraction.@xcite    these systems are notorious for physical complexity despite their chemical simplicity.@xcite but a broad physical description of these solutions is that water is a good solvent for peo chains , which are swollen by the solvent .",
    "our results for the osmotic second virial coefficients for ch@xmath0(ch@xmath1-o - ch@xmath1)@xmath15ch@xmath0 , @xmath16 obtained elsewhere from multi - chain solution simulations,@xcite indicates repulsive inter - segment interactions at ambient @xmath17 conditions . for an experimental perspective on peg osmotic pressures ,",

    "of course , that exponent was not the goal of the calculations implemented , which are detailed below .",
    "nevertheless , the solution environment can sensitively affects peg conformations.@xcite peg molecules are helical in @xmath19-propanoic , isobutyric , and isopentanoic acid solutions coexisting with liquid water,@xcite with helix formation requiring a trace of water.@xcite in contrast , these chains are generically coiled in aqueous solutions and also in acetic acid , isobutanol , and @xmath19-butanol .",
    "conformational sensitivity is associated with size fractionation of pegs between water and isobutyric acid.@xcite    the versatility of peg polymers solutions makes them a challenge for molecular thermodynamics .",

    "dependences for peg in water and methanol,@xcite but in ethanol only minor dependence on composition.@xcite    the results below extend the aqueous solution calculations discussed in a preliminary report that compared @xmath19-hexane solvent with water.@xcite previous simulation calculations@xcite evaluate different aspects of these solutions , and give a helpful baseline on which the present modeling builds .",
    "the simulation calculations below treated a single ch@xmath0(ch@xmath1-o - ch@xmath1)@xmath2ch@xmath0 molecule in water by molecular dynamics , using parallel tempering@xcite to achieve enhanced sampling of chain conformations .",

    "the natural comparative model for the density profiles,@xcite @xmath48{2\\pi \\left\\langle r_g{}^2(j)\\right\\rangle/3}}~ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is obtained by superposing of the gaussian distributions associated with the observed @xmath8 .",

    "chain structure factors , relevant to neutron scattering from a chain in neutral water , are compared in detail to a traditional continuum - gaussian model result .",
    "the most serious limitation of the traditional continuum - gaussian structure factor is the failure to match the trivially known @xmath3 limiting value .",
    "a discrete - gaussian model that is consistent with the correct @xmath3 value is considered .",
    "shifting - and - scaling the discrete - gaussian model helps to identify the low-@xmath4 to high-@xmath4 transition near @xmath5 when an empirically matched number of gaussian links is about one - third of the total number of effective - atom sites . the shifted - and - scaled discrete - gaussian model better identifies the transition from low-@xmath4 to high-@xmath4 behavior near @xmath49 , which thus provides a natural spatial size for the coarsened monomers .",
    "this short distance - scale boundary of 0.6  nm is directly verified with the @xmath6-space distributions .",
    "further testing of gaussian chain models for these systems shows that @xmath8 , the contribution of the @xmath9-th chain segment to @xmath10 , depends on contour index about as expected for gaussian chains despite quantitative discrepancies .",
    "the quantitative comparison expresses the swelling of these chains in water .",
    "monomers central to the chain contour are usually central to the chain globule .",
    "the density profiles of chain molecule segments relative to their center of mass can show distinctive density structuring for smaller chains due close proximity of central elements to the globule center . that density structuring washes - out for longer chains , and due to the coarsened length - scale @xmath50 , many chain elements then contributing additively to the density profiles .",
    "gaussian chain models thus become more satisfactory for the density profiles for longer chains .",
