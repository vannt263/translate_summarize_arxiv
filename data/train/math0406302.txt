    "the converse also holds for ultramatricial algebras but probably not for all rings .",
    "the next theorem states that all such equivalences indeed arise as matrix types of ultramatricial algebras :    [ th:1 ] let @xmath22 be a field or principal ideal domain and @xmath0 be an equivalence relation on the set of positive integers",

    "the _ basis type _ of a ring @xmath25 characterizes which finite rank free modules are isomorphic : @xmath34 the analogue of theorem  [ th:1 ] for basis types is theorem  1 of @xcite : every equivalence relation with the property @xmath2 if and only if @xmath35 is the basis type of a ring of infinite matrices .    clearly ,",

    "the isomorphism classes of finitely generated projective left modules over a ring @xmath25 form a commutative monoid where the binary operation is the direct sum .",
    "the quotient group of the monoid is denoted by @xmath42 . declaring the isomorphism classes of projective modules to be nonnegative",
    ", @xmath42 becomes a preordered group .",
    "the isomorphism class @xmath9 of @xmath25 , the free module of rank @xmath43 , is an order unit of @xmath42 .",
    "if @xmath44 is a ring homomorphism then let @xmath45 map the isomorphism class of a projective module @xmath46 to that of @xmath47 .",
    "so @xmath45 is a homomorphism preserving both the order and the order unit .",
    "if @xmath25 is an ultramatricial algebra then @xmath42 is a dimension group .",
    "conversely , every dimension group is isomorphic to the @xmath41 of an ultramatricial algebra .",
    "if @xmath25 and @xmath19 are ultramatricial algebras then every morphism between @xmath42 and @xmath48 is of the form @xmath45 for some algebra homomorphism @xmath44 .",
    "however , @xmath49 is not unique in general",
    ". nevertheless , every isomorphism between @xmath42 and @xmath48 comes from an isomorphism between @xmath25 and @xmath19 .",
    "thus , by restriction , @xmath41 is essentially an equivalence between the category of ultramatricial algebras over a given field and the category of dimension groups with morphisms the group homomorphisms preserving both the order and the order unit .",
    "now we examine how the matrix type of an ultramatricial algebra can be recovered from its dimension group .",
    "the standard morita equivalence between @xmath25 and @xmath23 induces an isomorphism between the @xmath41 groups .",
    "however , this isomorphism does not preserve the order unit , in fact @xmath50 is @xmath51 where @xmath9 is the order unit of @xmath42 .",
    "so if @xmath25 is an ultramatricial algebra , then the dimension groups @xmath50 and @xmath52 ( and hence the algebras @xmath23 and @xmath53 ) are isomorphic if and only if there is an order - preserving automorphism of @xmath42 sending @xmath54 to @xmath55 . obviously , for any dimension group @xmath13 whether an order - preserving automorphism maps @xmath54 to @xmath55 , depends only on the factor @xmath56 .",
    "such factors @xmath56 form a subgroup of the multiplicative group @xmath32 of the positive rationals .",
    "so the classification of matrix types of ultramatricial algebras is equivalent to the classification of subgroups of @xmath32 which arise from dimension groups in the above construction .",
    "theorem  [ th:2 ] states that all subgroups arise , and theorem  [ th:1 ] is just the translation of it to the language of matrix types of ultramatricial algebras .",
    "in the rest of the paper we prove theorem  [ th:2 ] . in this section",
    "we outline the main ideas of the proof and leave the details for the following sections .",
    "the next section fixes notations used frequently in the rest of the paper .",
    "section  [ sec : abelian - groups - endo ] recalls a construction of abelian groups .",
    "the actual proof is contained in the rest of the sections , which are organized so that they can be read independently . at the beginning of every section , we shall refer to its main proposition , which will be the only statement used in other sections .",
    "the same is true for subsections .    to prove theorem  [ th:2 ]",
    ", we fix a subgroup @xmath18 of the positive rationals and construct a dimension group @xmath15 for it .",
    "we search for @xmath15 ( as an abelian group without any order ) in the form @xmath57 where @xmath18 acts on the direct sum componentwise .",
    "we let @xmath18 act on @xmath58 by multiplication as required to act on the order unit .",
    "a key observation ( proposition  [ prop:2 ] ) is that if the only automorphisms of @xmath3 are the elements of @xmath18 and their negatives , then for any partial order @xmath59 on @xmath15 , which is preserved by @xmath18 and makes @xmath13 a dimension group , the order - preserving automorphism group of @xmath15 is only @xmath18 .",
    "so @xmath60 satisfies the theorem .",
    "therefore , all we have to do is to find such a @xmath3 and @xmath59 .",
    "actually , @xmath3 is already constructed by a.  l.  s.  corner in  @xcite .",

    "see also @xcite for the general statement .",
    "finally , we define a partial order @xmath59 on @xmath15 making it a dimension group in subsection  [ sec : partial - order ] .",
    "the basic idea is to explicitly make some subgroups of @xmath15 order - isomorphic to @xmath61 and show that these partial orders on the subgroups are compatible .",
    "this will be based on a description of @xmath3 ( proposition  [ prop:3 ] ) : we define elements of @xmath3 , which will be bases of order - subgroups @xmath61 of @xmath15 and state relations between them implying the compatibility of partial orders .",
    "this section is just for fixing notation used throughout the paper .",
    "let @xmath62 denote the element of the group ring @xmath63 corresponding to @xmath64 .",
    "this is to distinguish @xmath65 the value of @xmath62 at @xmath66 from @xmath67 the element @xmath66 multiplied by the rational number @xmath68 .",
    "if the automorphism group of an abelian group is the direct product of a group @xmath18 and the two element group generated by @xmath69 then we say that the automorphism group is @xmath70 .",

    "it is important to note that @xmath3 does _ not _ depend on the choice of the @xmath84 and @xmath86 .",
