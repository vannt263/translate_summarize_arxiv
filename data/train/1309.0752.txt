    "recent research in wsns mostly deals with the aim to maximize energy efficiency (  @xcite ,  @xcite ) . in this regard",
    ", some authors worked at routing layer (  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ) while others (  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ) explored mac layer .",
    "however , our directions are more focused on different decoding schemes to achieve maximum energy efficiency . in  @xcite , p. grover _ et al . _",
    "investigate the perspective of interference on decoding power .",
    "they suggest that in short range communication the transmit power is smaller than decoding power and uncoded transmission requires more transmit power than coded transmission .",
    "et al . _ designed ldpc decoder architecture for wsn .",
    "different ldpc codes are considered to analyze the energy saving w.r.t un - coded communication , depending on distance , ber and environment  @xcite .",
    "_ calculate critical distance @xmath2 at which the decoder s energy consumption per bit is equal to transmit energy per bit . in comparison to an un - coded system",
    ", authors provide results for @xmath2 in different environments over a wide frequency range  @xcite .",
    "_ investigate the tradeoff between transmission and processing energy consumption in sensor nodes by employing convolutional codes .",
    "for each sensor node , authors select appropriate complexity for ecc to prolong network lifetime  @xcite .",
    "z. hajjarian _ et al .",
    "_ define the relationship between the number of quantization bits and decoder s energy consumption using ldpc in wsn .",
    "decoder s complexity is reduced by replacement of functional blocks with look up tables .",
    "they suggest that ldpc codes are more energy efficient than conventional and block codes . using iterative decoding ,",
    "the network lifetime is increased up to four times with regular ldpc codes  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", authors propose a packet error reduction technique for reliable communication in wban .",
    "firstly , they calculate received signal strength ( rss ) around the human body . secondly , based on these calculations of rss",
    ", they calculate packet error rate ( per ) .",
    "lt codes are considered for wban to reduce the per . in  @xcite",
    ", authors use rateless codes to provide an adaptive duty cycling for power management .",
    "analytical results show that with same structure used for wsns , upto @xmath3 percent of energy is saved as compared to ieee 802.15.4 physical layer standard .",
    "z. h. cai _",
    "_ propose an efficient early stopping method to reduce number of iterations for ldpc decoders .",
    "this method is very efficient at low snr  @xcite .",
    "wban consists of small sensors with limited battery power . in this paper ,",
    "our objective is to increase the network lifetime or to minimize the energy consumption of network .",
    "reliability is another primary requirement for communication .",
    "the level of reliable communication depends on applications and user specific constraints .",
    "error correction schemes provide reliable communication between transmitter and receiver by reducing @xmath4 . in practical situations , such as wban",
    "there are two ways to reduce @xmath4 .",
    "+ 1 . increasing the transmit power",
    "improves the snr : + for additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel , @xmath5 for bpsk modulation is expressed as : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a scaled form of the complementary gaussian error function .",
    "use complex decoder by increasing the decoding power : + in the case of wban an increase in transmit power is not sufficient because increase in transmit power damages the human tissues .",
    "another problem is the existence of small distance between receiver and transmitter .",
    "the transmit power increases the signal to interference and noise ratio ( sinr ) . in this case",
    "how we can improve sinr ?",
    "this is done by increasing the distance between transmitters . however , in wban it is not possible because of limited area . in any communication system",
    "a tradeoff between transmit power and decoding power exists .",
    "wban requires low transmitting power so , there is need to implement energy efficient decoder to reduce the decoding power consumption to enhance the network lifetime .",
    "we use ldpc , because its performance for low ber communication is same as complex decoders such as viterbi decoding algorithms .",
    "[ sec : pagestyle ] like all linear block codes , ldpc codes can be represented in two different possibilities .",
    "they can be described via graphical representation and matrices .",
    "ldpc codes are represented as as tanner graph that contain two set of nodes : check nodes ( cns ) and variable nodes ( vns ) .",
    "vns are associated with n bits of codeword and cns corresponds to m parity - check constraints .",
    "edges in tanner graph correspond to @xmath8 in h and exchange of information along these edges as shown in fig.2 .",
    "belief propagation ( bp ) algorithm is commonly used to decode ldpc codes .",
    "let @xmath9 represents the llr of the bit in column @xmath10 of @xmath11 .",
    "llr is initialized to the corresponding received soft value . for each parity constraint @xmath12 in a given layer ,",
    "the following operations are executed [ 5 ] : @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18    @xmath19 is the extrinsic information received from previous layer and updated in equation ( 5 ) .",
    "this information is propagated to succeeding layer .",
    "@xmath20 is used to compute equation ( 1 ) then updated in equation ( 4 ) .",
    "term , @xmath21 is used again in following iteration .",
    "@xmath22 in equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) represents set of all bits connected to parity constraint m. whole operation of ldpc decoder is given in fig.1 .",
    "for encoded data transmission , the energy consumption per bit of a node is the sum of radio energy per bit @xmath23 and computation energy per bit @xmath24 .",
    "radio energy is sum of sleep , transient , and on mode energies .",
    "the transceiver is off all the times and keeping it on only when data is transmitting or receiving .",
    "the radio energy per bit for transmitting @xmath25 bits is calculated as in [ 12 ] : @xmath26    power consumed in radio during on - mode is the sum of transmitting power @xmath27 and power consumption in circuitry @xmath28 .",
    "the radio energy consumption is : @xmath29 transmission power required in free space is expressed by using friis equation : @xmath30    the received power is calculated as : @xmath31 where , @xmath32 is snr for transmitting uncoded data , @xmath33 is number of bits per modulation symbol , @xmath34 is bandwidth , @xmath35 is noise spectral density and @xmath36 is noise figure .    for coded data received power",
    "is : @xmath37 transmission energy for coded data frame is expressed as : @xmath38 the required processing energy to decode a bit is @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , the energy required to decode a frame @xmath40 is computed as : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the coding rate .    in [ 9 ] the shannon capacity limit for both coded and uncoded systems is shown as in fig .",
    "aid predicts the threshold at number of iterations for undecodable blocks .",
    "another advantage is reduction in processing delay .",
    "ldpc codes yield excellent performance when they are decoded with iterative message passing algorithms .",
    "the performance of an iteratively decoded ldpc code is typically reported in terms of @xmath43 for a specific snr value . for high snr values , the value @xmath43 is small that requires a large number of iterations in order to obtain reliable estimate . in aid , we introduce a threshold on the number of iterations after achieving a certain ber @xmath0 .",
    "the whole process of aid is shown in fig.4 .",
    "we assume that each pe consumes a fixed @xmath44 joules of energy per iteration .",
    "we assume that the @xmath45 is equal to data rate @xmath46 measured in information bits per second .",
    "the power received at distance @xmath47 meter is given in eq [ 9 ] .",
    "in eq [ 13 ] the @xmath48 is the energy consumed in decoder operation . for any rate @xmath46 the average probability of error @xmath49 .",
    "let the number of decoding iterations be denoted by @xmath50 , the number of computational nodes can be lower bounded by m , the number of received channel outputs .",
    "since each node consumes @xmath44 joules of energy in each iteration , the decoding energy @xmath48 is lower bounded in [ 2 ] as : @xmath51 .",
    "we assume channel encoding is free .",
    "this result is the following lower bounds on the weighted total power is @xmath52 , and @xmath53 . where @xmath54 is the time consumed in decoding .",
    "thus , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , where , @xmath57 is power loss and @xmath58 is received power .                [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "ldpc code with code rate @xmath59 has been used in simulation over awgn channel with an iterative probabilistic decoding algorithm .",
    "the bandwidth is large ( 3ghz ) and the throughput is 1.5 gbps .",
    "the power of a pe is 10 pico - joules . for indoor environment , path - loss exponent",
    "are assumed to be 3 and noise figure is 3db .",
    "the transmitter power is in few milli watts for 3 m distance between sensor and base station .",
    "if the transmit power @xmath60 is extremely close to that required for channel capacity then large number of iterations @xmath50 are required .",
    "large number of iterations consume high decoding power .",
    "encoder should have larger power as compared to its shannon limit in order to minimize decoding power consumption .",
    "simulations parameters are shown in fig.8 .",
    "fig.5 , shows the relationship between the snr and ber , as we increase the snr , ber decreses . by imposing five iterations @xmath61 ,",
    "it is observed that targeting a specific ber of @xmath62 the requried snr is @xmath63 at @xmath64 0.75 and snr 2.5 at @xmath64 0.5 .",

    "our target is to achieve a ber of @xmath62 and calculate the number of iterations till desired ber of @xmath62 is achieved .",
    "results show that at @xmath64 , 0.75 the required iterations are 16 and at @xmath64 0.5 , 12 iterations are required .",
    "fig.7 , shows the relationship among the total number of iterations and total power consumption by using ldpc decoder and aid . for the case of ldpc code",
    ", we use 50 iterations at a code rate of 0.75 .",
    "there is no threshold for achieving a certain value of @xmath65 . as @xmath66 the total power consumption @xmath67 .",
    "simulation results show that @xmath60 increases by increasing the number of iterations . for 50 iterations @xmath60",
    "is 1.3 joule . in aid ,",
    "our requirement is to achieve a ber of @xmath62 , it is achieved at 16th iteration .",
    "hence , we save the energy consumption of 35 iterations and also minimize the processing delay of decoder .",
    "this scheme is equally performed well for such applications in which we can not afford delay .",
    "simulation results show that the total energy consumption of error correction code is exactly 1.05 joule . with the code rate of 0.5 ,",
    "energy consumed is 0.5 joule in total .",
    "we save 22@xmath68 of total energy as compared to ldpc codes .",
