    "development of new real - time solar neutrino detectors is of great interest for current particle physics @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 in was proposed long ago @xcite as a promising target for solar neutrino spectroscopy , having low threshold of 114 kev for the @xmath13 capture @xcite , which allows to measure flux of low energy solar @xmath14 neutrinos , and high natural abundance of 95.71% @xcite .",
    "the process of @xmath13 capture can be effectively discriminated from the background processes using a specific tag : the emission of a prompt electron after the @xmath13 capture @xmath1 in + @xmath13 @xmath15 @xmath1sn(@xmath16=613 kev ) + @xmath17 with the subsequent emission , after typical time delay of @xmath18=4.7  @xmath19s , of two @xmath20 quanta with energies of @xmath21=116 kev and @xmath22=497 kev from deexcitation of the second excited level of @xmath1sn . notwithstanding these attractive features ,",
    "the building of a @xmath1in - based detector is a challenging task because @xmath1 in is unstable : it @xmath0 decays to ground state of @xmath1sn ( albeit with big half life of @xmath23=4.41@xmath24 yr @xcite ) creating intensive irremovable background .",
    "this makes necessary to divide the detector in small cells and search not only for time- but also for space - correlation between the emitted electron and the gamma quanta .",
    "the possibility to create a solar neutrino detector with @xmath1 in as a target is under investigation in the lens ( low energy neutrino spectroscopy ) project @xcite . in this framework , in particular , in radiopurity and bremsstrahlung from beta decay @xmath1 in @xmath15 @xmath1sn were investigated , being important characteristics which could prevent the successful exploitation of time- and space - correlations .",
    "measurements of in sample with hp ge detectors were performed deep underground , in the gran sasso national laboratories ( italy ) , on the depth of 3800 m w.e . as a by - product of these measurements , the @xmath0 decay of @xmath1 in to the first excited level of @xmath1sn ( @xmath25=497.4 kev )",
    "was observed at the first time @xcite .",
    "it has an extremely low intensity ( 1.2@xmath26 in comparison with the @xmath0 decay to @xmath1sn ground state ) and long half life of @xmath23=3.7@xmath27 yr @xcite .",
    "these extreme values are related with the very low energy release , @xmath2=1.6@xmath284.0 kev , that makes this process the @xmath0 decay with probably the lowest known @xmath2 value .",
    "after brief summary of the experiment and data analysis , we discuss in this paper a possible use of the @xmath1 in @xmath15 @xmath1sn(@xmath25=497 kev ) decay for setting a limit on the neutrino mass .",
    "a sample of natural high purity in with weight of 928.7@xmath280.1 g was measured with four hp - ge detectors mounted in one cryostat with a well in the centre .",
    "the hp - ge detectors were of 225.2 , 225.0 , 225.0 and 220.7 cm@xmath4 volume , and had typical energy resolution of 2.0 kev ( fwhm ) at the 1332 kev line of @xmath30co .",
    "the experimental set - up was enclosed in a lead and copper passive shielding and had a nitrogen ventilation system against radon .",
    "data were collected in the gran sasso national laboratories ( italy ) , on the depth of 3800 m w.e . during 2762.3 h for the in sample and during 1601.0 h for the background , in both cases with the complete shielding around the detectors .",
    "statistics in the in and background measurements was accumulated in few independent runs that resulted in some minor shifts in position of peaks present in the spectra .",
    "internal peaks of known origin and with good statistics were used to recalibrate spectra from individual runs to obtain summary spectra with the help of the sand0 routine @xcite . in result ,",
    "the peaks positions in the sum spectra deviate from their table values of less than 0.1 kev in the range of 3002615 kev both for the in and background measurements .",
    "efficiency of the detectors for gamma quanta emitted from the in sample was calculated with a geant4-based code @xcite .",
    "the results were checked in measurements with a @xmath30co source , performed with the same set - up .",
    "the measured absolute efficiencies agree with the computed ones within 12% and are consistent within their statistical uncertainties . in the following ,",
    "we estimate the systematic uncertainty of the monte carlo efficiencies to be 10% .",
    "the measured spectra for the in sample and for the background are presented in fig .  1 .",
    "the bremsstrahlung emission from the @xmath1 in @xmath0 decay with end point of 499 kev is clearly visible as the continuous component in the in spectrum . in both spectra ,",
    "42 gamma lines with energy above 200 kev were found . all lines ( except of line with energy of 497.4 kev in the in sample )",
    "were identified ; they come from the natural radionuclides and radioactive series ( @xmath31k , @xmath32u , @xmath33u , @xmath34th ) and from cosmogenic or antropogenic nuclides ( @xmath30co , @xmath35cs , @xmath36bi , @xmath37al ) that are usually present as contaminations in copper and lead @xcite",
    ". the counting rates of the @xmath20 lines for the in sample and the background were equal within their statistical uncertainties .    the only @xmath20 line of the in spectrum which is not present in the background measurement and can not be ascribed to the usual radioactive contaminants is located at the energy of 497.48@xmath280.21 kev ( see insert in fig .  1 ) .",
    "> from the fit of the in spectrum in the energy region 487508 kev with a gaussian peak and linear background assumption , the net area is 90@xmath2822 counts , inconsistent with zero at more than 4@xmath38 . variations of the energy interval for the fit result in changes of the area inside the quoted uncertainty . with the same procedure applied to the background spectrum , no gaussian peak could be found , and the resulting area is 0@xmath2814 counts ; the corresponding upper limit derived with the feldman - cousins method @xcite is 23 counts at 90@xmath39 c.l . it can hence be concluded that the peak of 497.4 kev is statistically significant and related with the in sample , being absent in the background measurement .",
    "the energy of the first excited level of @xmath1sn , daughter nucleus after the @xmath1 in @xmath0 decay , is equal to 497.35@xmath280.08 kev . if populated , this level deexcites with the emission of a @xmath20 quantum with energy @xmath40=497.358@xmath280.024 kev @xcite which is in nice agreement with that of the observed peak 497.48@xmath280.21 kev . however , the @xmath2 value ( i.e. atomic mass difference @xmath41 between @xmath1 in and @xmath1sn ) given in the atomic mass tables of audi & wapstra , known at the moment of our measurements , was equal to 495 kev @xcite and 496 kev @xcite .",
    "thus the transition to the first excited level of @xmath1sn was energetically forbidden value @xcite . ] , and the @xmath0 decay of @xmath1 in was considered as going exclusively to the ground state of @xmath1sn @xcite ( see fig .",
    "however , revised value of @xmath2=499@xmath284 kev in the last tables @xcite allowed to avoid this contradiction : with this value , the decay to the first excited level @xmath1 in @xmath42sn(@xmath25=497.4 kev ) is kinematically allowed , though with an extremely small @xmath2 value , @xmath2=1.6@xmath284.0 kev .    using the area of the 497 kev peak observed in the indium spectrum , corresponding partial half life for the transition to the first excited level of @xmath1sn can be calculated as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the number of @xmath1 in nuclei in the sample , @xmath45 is the efficiency to detect the full energy @xmath20 with the 4 hp ge detectors , @xmath46 is the measurement time , @xmath47 is the area of the peak and @xmath48 is the coefficient of conversion of @xmath20 quanta to electrons for the given nuclear transition .",
    "the full peak efficiency at 497 kev was calculated with the monte carlo simulation as @xmath45=3.32@xmath280.33% .",
    "taking into account the total mass of the indium sample ( 928.7 g ) , the atomic weight of indium ( 114.818 g@xmath49mol@xmath50 @xcite ) and the isotopic abundance of @xmath1 in ( 95.71% @xcite ) , the number of @xmath1 in nuclei in our sample is @xmath44=4.66@xmath51 . with the area of the peak 90@xmath2822 counts ,",
    "the electron conversion coefficient for the transition @xmath48=8.1@xmath52 @xcite , and @xmath46=2762.3 h , the @xmath23 value is equal @xmath53    half life for the ground state to ground state @xmath0 decay of @xmath1 in , because of the large change in the nuclear angular momentum ( 9/2@xmath54 @xmath15 1/2@xmath55 , that classifies this decay as 4-fold forbidden transition ) and of the relatively small @xmath2 value , is equal to @xmath23=4.41@xmath56 yr @xcite .",
    "thus the probability of decay to the first excited level is near one million times lower than for the transition to the ground state of @xmath1sn ; the experimental branching ratio is @xmath57=(1.18@xmath280.31)@xmath58 .",
    "the uncertainty on the half life and on the branching ratio mainly comes from the statistical error on the net area of the 497 kev peak .",
    "an updated scheme of the @xmath1 in @xmath15 @xmath1sn @xmath0 decay is presented in fig .",
    "in some nuclear processes @xmath20 rays with energies close to 497 kev are emitted .",
    "this could give an alternative explanation of the peak observed in the experimental spectrum .",
    "luckily , additional @xmath20 rays are also emitted in such decays , allowing to tag those mimicking effects .",
    "the @xmath1 in nucleus has an isomeric state @xmath59 in with the energy @xmath60=336.2 kev and a half life of 4.5 h @xcite . with the probability of 0.047% the @xmath59 in nucleus",
    "@xmath0 decays to the first excited level of @xmath1sn , with the subsequent emission of a 497 kev @xmath20 ray @xcite .",
    "however , in this case a @xmath20 ray with the energy @xmath60=336.2 kev is emitted with much higher probability ( 45.84% @xcite ) because of the electromagnetic transition from the isomeric @xmath59 in to the ground @xmath1 in state .",
    "this huge peak at 336.2 kev , whose area should be @xmath710@xmath4 times bigger than that of the observed 497.4 kev peak , is absent in the experimental spectrum ; only a peak at 338.3 kev is observed , with the net area of 138@xmath2850 counts , which corresponds to the decay of @xmath61ac from the @xmath34th natural chain . therefore the decay of the isomeric state @xmath59 in is absolutely negligible and the 497 kev peak can not be ascribed to it , not even in part .",
    "capture of thermal neutrons by @xmath1 in results in @xmath62 in in excited state and subsequent cascade of @xmath20 quanta .",
    "in particular , @xmath20 quantum with energy of 497.7 kev and relative yield of 1.32% line with energy of 273.0 kev is accepted as 100% .",
    "] will be emitted @xcite .",
    "however , accompanying intensive peak of 273.0 kev and , for example , peak of 492.5 kev ( 8.68% ) are absent in the spectrum ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "capture of thermal @xmath63 on @xmath64 in ( natural abundance 4.29% @xcite ) also results in emission of @xmath20 quantum with close energy : 496.7 kev ( 0.75% ) @xcite .",
    "however , more intensive peaks ( 311.6 kev  100% , 502.6 kev  5.00% ) also are absent in the spectrum .",
    "thus , due to the underground location of the experimental setup and the low flux of neutrons @xcite , we conclude that @xmath65 reactions can not contribute to the peak under analysis .",
    "protons produced by fast neutron or cosmic ray muons can populate the second excited level of @xmath1sn ( @xmath16=612.8 kev ) via the @xmath66 reaction on @xmath1 in ( @xmath67=0.9 mev ) ; the @xmath1sn nucleus quickly returns to the ground state with the emission of two @xmath20 rays of energy 115.4 and 497.4 kev .",
    "the contribution originated by fast neutrons is practically zero ( see f.i .",
    "@xcite ) because of the deep underground location and the lack of hydrogenous materials in the setup . on the other hand ,",
    "since the muon flux in the laboratory is extremely low ( 1 @xmath19/(m@xmath68@xmath49h ) @xcite ) , also the contribution of @xmath66 reactions induced by cosmic rays ( see also @xcite ) to the 497 kev peak is negligible ( @xmath6910@xmath70 counts ) .",
    "some decays from the natural @xmath32u and @xmath34th chains can also give @xmath20 rays in the energy region of interest , though with very low intensity .",
    "they are in particular @xcite @xmath71bi ( @xmath72 = 496.7 kev , @xmath73 = 0.0069% ) , @xmath61ac ( @xmath72 = 497.5 kev , @xmath73 = 0.0059% ) and @xmath74pa ( @xmath72 = 498.0 kev , @xmath73 = 0.062% ) .",
    "however , the sum contribution of these decays to the 497 kev peak is less than 1 count and can be estimated using their stronger associated @xmath20 lines .",
    "for instance , the area of the 338.3 kev line of @xmath61ac , whose relative intensity is 11.27% , is only 138@xmath2850 counts .",
    "therefore , if the contamination were located in the in sample , the estimated contribution to the 497 kev peak , taking also into account the different full peak efficiency , would be ( 7.3@xmath282.6)@xmath7510@xmath76 counts .",
    "in addition , possible imitation of the effect could come from the so - called @xmath20-@xmath0 decay of @xmath1 in . in this process , also called induced ",
    "photobeta \" decay @xcite , an external @xmath20 quantum is absorbed by the nucleus , thereby providing additional energy .",
    "this allows the @xmath0 transition to excited levels of daughter nucleus , otherwise energetically forbidden , or even stimulates the @xmath0 decay of stable nuclei . in cases when the decay to ground state is strongly suppressed by a large change in the spin ( as for @xmath1 in @xmath15 @xmath1sn ) , transitions to excited levels would be preferable",
    ".    the process could be actual in the case of strong electromagnetic fields in stars @xcite or in a field of synchrotron radiation @xcite , but also in the searches for extremely rare processes , like ours .",
    "if the @xmath1 in nucleus absorbs a @xmath20 quantum with energy @xmath40@xmath77114 kev from an external source , or even a bremsstrahlung @xmath20 from @xmath1 in @xmath0 decay itself , the second excited level of @xmath1sn , with energy 612.8 kev , could be populated ( spin changes from 9/2@xmath54 to 7/2@xmath54 , and this is an allowed @xmath0 transition ) . in the subsequent deexcitation process",
    ", two @xmath20 s with energies of 115.4 kev and 497.4 kev will be emitted , thus leading to the peak of 497.4 kev ( see fig .",
    "the calculated cross - sections of the @xmath20-@xmath0 process are quite low : of the order of 10@xmath7810@xmath79 @xmath80 , depending on the @xmath81 of the parent nucleus , on @xmath40 and on the energy threshold @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it was calculated that in a field of intensive synchrotron radiation from the spring-8 source ( japan ) , the @xmath0 decay of @xmath1 in could go faster by 2 orders of magnitude @xcite . however , scaling the spring-8 intensity of @xmath710@xmath82 @xmath20/(s@xmath49mm@xmath68@xmath49mrad@xmath68@xmath49kev ) to the @xmath20 radiation intensity in our measurements , @xmath690.1 @xmath20/(s@xmath49kev ) ( see fig .  1 ) , it is evident that the contribution of @xmath20-@xmath0 decay to the 497.4 kev peak is negligible .",
    "it is interesting to note here another interesting process , the so - called @xmath0-@xmath20 decay @xcite : when the direct @xmath0 transition to the ground state of daughter nucleus is highly forbidden , a process could take place in which a @xmath20 quantum is emitted simultaneously with the electron and antineutrino .",
    "such a process is second - order in perturbation theory and is similar to the double @xmath0 decay of a nucleus .",
    "the branching ratio of such decay for @xmath1 in was calculated in @xcite as : 6.7@xmath83 .",
    "because in this case three particles ( @xmath20 , @xmath0 and @xmath84 ) are emitted with sum energy equal to @xmath2 , and the @xmath20 s energy distribution is continuous , the 497.4 kev peak could not be imitated .",
    "however , it should be noted that it could be an additional source of @xmath20 quanta in the in - based solar neutrino detector ( with the branching ratio of @xmath510@xmath85 , as in @xmath0 decay @xmath1 in @xmath15 @xmath1sn@xmath86 ) which also should be taken into account @xcite .",
    "with the value of @xmath2=1.6@xmath284.0 kev , decay @xmath1 in @xmath15 @xmath1sn@xmath86 possibly is the @xmath0 decay with the lowest known @xmath2 value ( to be compared with that of @xmath87ho : 2.555 kev and @xmath6re : 2.469 kev @xcite ) . below we will try to determine the @xmath2 value more exactly on the basis of the systematics of @xmath88 values for such kind of decay and the measured value of @xmath23 .",
    "nuclear spin and parity are changed in the observed transition from the initial 9/2@xmath54 of the @xmath1 in ground state to 3/2@xmath54 of @xmath1sn@xmath86 ; this is therefore a 2-fold forbidden unique @xmath0 decay .",
    "the recent compilation of @xmath88 values @xcite gives for such a decay the average value @xmath88=15.6@xmath281.2 ; for the 12 known experimental cases , the range is from 13.9 to 18.0 . with the measured value of the half life of ( 3.73@xmath280.98)@xmath89 yr",
    ", the `` experimental '' @xmath90 value is @xmath90=12.47@xmath281.21 . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath90 can be estimated with the help of the logft tool at the national nuclear data center , usa @xcite which is based on the procedure described in @xcite . for @xmath2=1.6 kev ,",
    "the value calculated with the logft code is @xmath90=10.8 ; this means that with such a @xmath2 the @xmath0 decay should go near 50 times faster",
    ".    one can solve the inverse problem and use the logft code to adjust the @xmath2 value corresponding to the `` experimental '' @xmath90=12.47@xmath281.21 .",
    "such a procedure gives a value of @xmath2=@xmath91 ev .",
    "the lowest value of @xmath88=13.9 in the range of the known 2-fold forbidden unique @xmath0 decays @xcite corresponds to @xmath2=120 ev , while the highest value ( @xmath88=18.0 ) gives @xmath2=2.85 kev.in@xmath1sn : it is equal to @xmath92 kev ( with the error bars corresponding to the whole range of 13.918.0 of @xmath88 values ) , which is more precise than the recent value of 499@xmath284 kev @xcite . ]",
    "while possibly the logft tool was not intented to be applied for such low energies , in any case it is clear that the @xmath2 value in the @xmath0 decay @xmath1 in @xmath15 @xmath1sn@xmath86 is very close to zero evaluation for @xmath1 in gives some indication for this : the @xmath2 value was slightly lower than 497.4 kev energy of the first excited @xmath1sn state in accordance with older tables of atomic masses , @xmath2=495@xmath284 kev @xcite and 496@xmath284 kev @xcite , while it is slightly higher in the last evaluation , 499@xmath284 kev @xcite . ] .",
    "such a unique situation could be used to establish a limit on the antineutrino mass , in addition to the experiments with @xmath93h and @xmath6re , where up - to - date limits are in the range of @xmath52 ev @xcite and @xmath515 ev @xcite , respectively .",
    "two approaches could be proposed .",
    "\\(1 ) to measure the shape of the @xmath0 spectrum @xmath1 in @xmath15 @xmath1sn@xmath86 , registering @xmath0 particle in coincidence with @xmath20 497 kev , which allows to reduce the background due to the @xmath0 decay of @xmath1 in to the ground state of @xmath1sn .",
    "new in - based semiconductor detectors or fast bolometers could be used for the purpose .",
    "mass of antineutrino could be derived from distortion of the spectrum shape ( as in @xmath4h experiments ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that such measurements would be quite difficult because of : ( i ) extremely low @xmath2 value ; ( ii ) the shape of 2-fold forbidden @xmath0 decay has to be theoretically calculated very precisely , that may be not so easy also due to low @xmath2 value .",
    "\\(2 ) just to use evident relation @xmath94@xmath69@xmath2 .",
    "thus , low @xmath2 value means also low limit on neutrino mass . because predictive power of any theoretical calculation for such low energies is uncertain , the best way to derive potentially good limit on @xmath94 is to measure experimentally with accuracy better than current : ( i ) the atomic mass difference @xmath95in@xmath1sn ) ; ( ii ) the energy of the first excited level of @xmath1sn .",
    "energy of @xmath20 quantum emitted from the first excited @xmath1sn level is known currently as 497.358@xmath280.024 kev @xcite , i.e. with precision of 24 ev . however , this uncertainty could be reduced further in measurements of electron capture @xmath1sb @xmath15 @xmath1sn .",
    "it should be noted that many calibration lines of radioactive sources were already measured with accuracy of 0.10.3 ev , also in the @xmath7500 kev region of our interest @xcite .",
    "current uncertainty @xmath96 on atomic mass difference between @xmath1 in and @xmath1sn is equal to 4 kev @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that current technics ( penning traps ) allows to reach accuracy of @xmath9710@xmath98 in atomic mass measurements @xcite , that corresponds to @xmath510 ev for nuclei with @xmath99@xmath5100 .",
    "for example , in work @xcite absolute masses of @xmath100s and @xmath101s were determined with accuracy of 1.5 ev , and masses of @xmath102xe and @xmath103xe with accuracy of 9 ev .",
    "even lower uncertainties could be expected for measurement of difference of atomic masses .",
    "as the first step , it could be useful to measure @xmath95in@xmath1sn ) with not - challenging accuracy of @xmath5100 ev : if , for example , @xmath41 will be equal 460@xmath28100 ev , it will be enough not to expect good limit on @xmath94 . however , if it will be measured as @xmath50@xmath28100 ev , uncertainty on @xmath41 should be further reduced . in case if we are lucky and @xmath95in@xmath1sn ) @xmath5 @xmath25(@xmath1sn ) , we could obtain @xmath104 possibly concurrent with that from experiments with @xmath4h ( @xmath52 ev ) or @xmath6re ( @xmath515 ev ) .",

    "evidence for the previously unknown @xmath0 decay of @xmath1 in to the first excited state of @xmath1sn at 497.4 kev was found from the measurement of the @xmath20 spectrum of a sample of metallic indium performed with hp ge detectors in the gran sasso laboratory .",
    "the @xmath105 value for this channel is @xmath2=1.6@xmath284.0 kev which could be the lowest of all the known @xmath0 decays .",

    "the derived atomic mass difference between @xmath1 in and @xmath1sn is equal @xmath92 kev , which is more exact than the recent value 499@xmath284 kev @xcite .",
