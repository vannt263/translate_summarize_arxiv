    "research on moving groups can be traced back into a century ago , @xcite discovered two clearest moving groups in the solar neighborhood ( hyades and ursa major ) , which were the only ones known near earth for nearly 100 years .",
    "since data of the hipparcors satellite @xcite which consist of accurate parallaxes and proper motions were available , the study of moving groups in the solar vicinity has made great progress .",
    "productive moving groups were identified by their coherent kinematic structures like pleiades , ursa , hyades , hercules , ic2391 , coma , hr1614 moving group and so on @xcite .",
    "recent work by @xcite identified 22 moving group candidates with the newly - developed wavelet transform technique by @xcite .",
    "although these statistical studies of large samples of stars have confirmed the existence of moving groups , their origins and evolution still remain unclear .    according to @xcite , moving groups are the mid - step between stars in open clusters and field stars . as open clusters are disrupted by the gravitational effects ,",
    "their associations stretch into a tube - like structure around the galactic plane and dissolve into the background after several galactic orbits .",
    "this hypothesis that moving groups are a result of the dispersion of stellar clusters was restricted to young groups of stars with ages less than 1 gyr , as disk heating and differential galactic rotation would have dissolved older groups among the field stars .",
    "another theoretical hypothesis in favour of different dynamical origins of moving groups were put forward by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that most moving groups observed in the solar vicinity could be formed by orbital resonances , related to the galactic spiral structure , combined with initial velocities of the stars @xcite .",
    "the works by @xcite observed a very wide range of ages for each of kinematic structures in their h - r diagram and found that the hyades moving group is mixed by stars evaporated from the hyades cluster and a group of older stars trapped at a resonance .",
    "those minor kinematic groups are related to the accretion events in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "nowadays , the second hypothesis with resonant mechanism is considered to be the most plausible explanation for most moving groups @xcite .",
    "it is crucial to investigate the chemical composition of stars from the moving groups to better understand the origins and evolutionary histories of these groups and give rise to new clues and theories of such kinematic structures .",
    "there have been only a few works analyzing abundances other than iron of moving group stars with high resolution spectra in recent years .",
    "this paper focuses on the discussion of 13 elemental abundances of 19 k - type giants from moving group 6 and 7 , identified by @xcite , which have opposite u - velocity .",
    "we analyze the discrepancy of abundances between these two moving groups and discuss the effects of their chemical evolution and kinematic structures .",

    "the stellar atmospheric parameters are described in section  [ atm ] .",
    "section  [ abu ] derives the elemental abundances of our sample stars and estimates the uncertainties while detailed analysis and discussions of the results are given in section  [ res ] .",
    "section  [ con ] summarizes the conclusion of this paper .",
    "our observation targets were selected from moving group 6 and 7 @xcite , primarily depending on the galactic space - velocity components ( u , v , and w ) .",
    "the stars from group 6 have the mean velocity of ( 38 , -20 , -15 ) km s@xmath1 while the mean motions of group 7 are ( -57 , -45 , -16 ) km s@xmath1 .",
    "these two moving groups have opposite directions of velocities towards the galactic center , indicating their different locations on the galactic disk .",
    "19 k - type giants from the two moving groups ( 9 stars from moving group 6 and 10 stars from moving group 7 ) were observed .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram of our bright and cool sample stars are shown in figure.[fig1 ] , as well as the whole sample stars from @xcite .",
    "the observations were carried out with boes @xcite attached to the 1.8 m telescope at bohyunsan optical astronomy observatory ( boao ) in two nights : 2009 march 1 and march 4 .",
    "we used a 2k @xmath2 4k ccd with wavelength coverage of 3700 @xmath3 9250   and set the spectral resolution of boes to be about 45000 , corresponding to the 200 @xmath4 m fiber .",
    "the average signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of most stars turned out to be in the range of 100 @xmath3 200 , except for hd44412 , which has snr of 80 due to the bad weather .",

    "then we used midas program for continuum normalization .",
    "we obtained the radial velocity by cross - correlation method with a standard spectrum .",
    "finally , we calculated the equivalent widths by two methods . for intermediate - strong lines , we fitted the line profiles with a gaussian function .",
    "the direct integration was used for strong unblended lines .",
    "we discarded some strong lines ( @xmath7 @xmath8 110 m  for fei lines and @xmath7 @xmath8 150 m  for nii and cai lines ) which are less sensitive to abundances .",
    "the validity of equivalent width measurements were checked by comparing them to the previous independent work by @xcite , whose spectra were taken from oao / hides , which have resolution of about 67000 and snr of 100 @xmath3 300 for a common star : hd61363 on figure.[fig3 ] .",

    "our results of [ na / mg ] display overabundance at lower [ mg / h ] , with respect to that of liu07 , for those stars which have evolved to upper - tip red giant branch .",
    "the reason is that the abundance of na will be enriched as a result of ne - na cycle from deeper layers being dredged to the surface , and has also been found in some studies of giants @xcite .",
    "our results of [ al / mg ] decrease slightly with increasing [ mg / h ] , which have the relation of [ al / mg ] = 0.054 - 0.116 [ mg / h ] , different with the trend of liu07 but consistent with that of lh07 , may also due to the effects of evolution since the sample of lh07 has wider range of evolution than that of liu07 .",
    "the trends of na - al - mg indicate that mg abundances are less affected by possible nucleosynthesis and mixing than that of na or al @xcite .",

    "although each of them has kinematic coherence in the velocity space .",
    "the inhomogeneity of these two moving groups , different from open clusters , may indicate that the stars of moving group 6 and 7 have different chemical origins before they were kinematically gathered and both moving groups are not the dispersed remnants of clusters or star - forming events , but rather result from the kinematic effects of the galactic spiral structure so that we would not expect these kinematic groups to be chemically homogeneous and coeval .",

    "we conclude that abundances of most elements show similar trends with previous studies on giants ( liu07 ; takeda08 ) except for al , na and ba , because of evolution effects on our upper red giants .",

    "our results of [ na / mg ] increase smoothly with higher [ mg / h ] and [ al / mg ] decrease slightly with increasing [ mg / h ] , which are affected by stellar internal evolution significantly .",
    "the abundance ratios [ mg / ba ] of moving group 6 and 7 stars with similar [ ba / h ] @xmath3 0 are distinct by the order of 0.16 dex , which could come from their distinct chemical evolution histories corresponding to their different kinematics .",
    "the inhomogeneous [ fe / h ] values of these two moving group stars present different chemical origins for stars from both moving groups and favor the dynamical resonant theory .",
