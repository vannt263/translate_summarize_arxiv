    "in this paper , we have devised several objective functions for metric learning on positive semidefinite cone , all of which can be minimized by the dykstra algorithm .",
    "we have introduced a new technique that performs each update efficiently when the dykstra algorithm is applied to the metric learning problems .",
    "we have empirically demonstrated that the stochastic versions of the dykstra algorithm are much faster than the original algorithm .",

    "<S> recently , covariance descriptors have received much attention as powerful representations of set of points . in this research </S>",
    "<S> , we present a new metric learning algorithm for covariance descriptors based on the dykstra algorithm , in which the current solution is projected onto a half - space at each iteration , and runs at @xmath0 time . we empirically demonstrate that randomizing the order of half - spaces in our dykstra - based algorithm significantly accelerates the convergence to the optimal solution . </S>",
