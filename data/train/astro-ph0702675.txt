    "pulsating variable stars provide an ideal and important test bed for investigating the internal structure and evolution of stars ; so - called asteroseismology .",
    "open clusters have many benefits to investigate physical characteristics of population i pulsating variables .",
    "variable stars in a cluster can be restricted to their physical parameters by analysing the cluster with the same age , chemical abundance , distance , and interstellar reddening .",
    "simultaneous photometry of hundreds of stars ( both constant and variable ) in a single ccd frame enables us to obtain accurate and effective time - series data .",
    "furthermore , we can obtain high - precision photometric data for low - amplitude variables in open clusters since the crowding effect is not severe compared to the case of globular clusters .",
    "consequently , the observations of open clusters are obviously important for the investigation on physical properties of small - amplitude variables such as @xmath3 scuti - type pulsating stars @xcite .",
    "the open clusters with specific age range ( e.g. , intermediate - age of about 0.3 @xmath4 1.0 gyr ) and at a reasonable distance of about 1 @xmath4 2 kpc , are the best observing target for the asteroseismological study of @xmath3 scuti - type stars @xcite .",
    "physical properties of @xmath3 scuti - type stars in open clusters are reviewed in detail by @xcite .",
    "@xmath3 scuti - type pulsating stars are main sequence or subgiant stars in lower part of the classical cepheid instability strip with spectral types between a3 and f0 .",
    "they have short pulsation periods of 0.02 @xmath4 0.25 day @xcite .",
    "generally , high amplitude @xmath3 scuti - type stars with visual amplitude greater than 0.3 mag rotate slowly with @xmath5 less than 30 km s@xmath6 and appear to be excited in single or double radial pulsating modes @xcite . however , most @xmath3 scuti - type stars have small amplitudes less than 0.1 mag and rotate fast with the average speed of about 150 km s@xmath6 .",
    "their light curves are very complicate to indicate the overlap of multiple pulsating periods ; e.g. @xcite detected 79 frequencies for fg vir .",
    "these multi - periodic @xmath3 scuti - type stars excited in radial and non - radial modes are very important for asteroseismological tests on stellar structure and evolutionary models .",
    "@xcite suggested that multi - periodic @xmath3 scuti - type stars near the zero - age main sequence are particularly suitable for determining the extent of the convective core and internal rotation rate .",
    "asteroseismology on @xmath3 scuti - type stars , however , has produced very few convincing results until now .",
    "main reason for the lack of success is probably that the stars often rotate very fast to result in severe complexity of observing frequencies by rotational splitting of non - radial modes .",
    "the asteroseismological importance of observations for @xmath3 scuti - type stars in open clusters was well described by @xcite .    as our long term project for the survey of variable stars in open clusters ,",
    "extensive time - series ccd observations have been performing for intermediate - age open clusters using an 1.0 m telescope at mt .",
    "lemmon optical astronomy observatory ( loao ) in arizona , usa . the primary goal of this project is to search for short - period ( less than a few days ) pulsating variables such as @xmath3 scuti - type and @xmath7 doradus - type stars .",
    "it is also intriguing to examine possible relevance of characteristics of pulsating stars to the cluster parameters .    in this paper , we present results of time - series ccd photometry for ngc 2099 ( @xmath8 = 05@xmath952@xmath10183 , @xmath11 = + 3233 108 ) .",
    "the age of ngc 2099 about 400 myr is relatively well - established putting the object among the intermediate - age open clusters from previous studies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "it is a relatively rich and large cluster located at the low galactic latitude ( @xmath12 = 31 ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite carried out deep ccd observations and obtained color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) with well - defined main - sequence .",
    "however , there have been few systematic time - series observations for a large and representative sample of ngc 2099 so far .",
    "@xcite discovered only seven variables from their ccd observations .    in section 2 , we present our observations and data analysis .",
    "section 3 describes physical properties of pulsating variables and binary stars detected from our observations .",
    "the details of a peculiar variable kv10 with complex light variations are reported in section 4 .",
    "we discuss the cluster membership of the variable stars in section 5 .",
    "a brief summary and conclusions are given in section 6 .",
    "time - series observations of ngc 2099 were carried out on 12 nights in 2004 january , using a 2k ccd camera attached to the loao 1.0 m telescope in arizona , usa . the korea astronomy and space science institute ( kasi ) has been operating the telescope by remote control from korea via a network connection .",
    "the field of view of a ccd image is about 22.2 @xmath13 22.2 arcmin@xmath14 at the f/7.5 cassegrain focus of the telescope .",
    "total 581 images were obtained in the @xmath1 filter with 600 sec exposure time .",
    "additional observations were performed for three nights in 2006 february in order to secure bright @xmath3 scuti - type stars which are mostly saturated in long - exposure images . from this observing run",
    ", we obtained 639 images in the @xmath1 filter with 10 sec exposure time . in order to minimize position - dependent external errors",
    "@xcite , we carefully controlled the telescope so that a star can be located at the same position in all ccd frames during our observing run . in order to construct the cmd of ngc 2099 ,",
    "@xmath0 photometric observations were also made for two nights in 2004 october and one night in 2006 february .",
    "typical seeing ( fwhm ) was about 2.2 arcsec .",
    "figure 1 shows an observing field of the ngc 2099 .",
    "instrumental signatures of each frame were removed and calibrated using the bias , dark , and flat field frames , with aid of the iraf / ccdred package .",
    "we obtained instrumental magnitudes of stars from the empirical point spread function ( psf ) fitting method in the iraf / daophot package @xcite .",
    "since we did not make observations for standard stars , we have tied our data to the @xmath0 ccd photometric secondary standards in ngc 2099 from the data of @xcite .",
    "we compared our ccd photometry with the data from @xcite .",
    "our @xmath15 & @xmath1 magnitudes are in good agreement with those of @xcite : @xmath16 = @xmath170.022 and @xmath18 = @xmath170.032 .    in order to normalize instrumental magnitudes of our time - series @xmath1 frames , we applied an ensemble normalization technique @xcite .",
    "we selected a few tens of bright and unsaturated normalization stars with 15 @xmath2 17 mag , which are non - variable stars and are not located at the edge of ccd frame .",
    "coefficients of the following equations are calculated for each ccd frame ;    @xmath19 ,    @xmath20 ,    where @xmath15 & @xmath1 are standard magnitudes and @xmath12 & @xmath21 are instrumental magnitudes of time - series images for normalization stars respectively . @xmath22 and @xmath23 are coordinates of the normalization stars in a ccd frame . using the above equations , we normalized all stars for each ccd frame . with this technique",
    ", we corrected color ( a@xmath24 , c@xmath24 ) and position ( a@xmath25 , c@xmath25 and a@xmath26 , c@xmath26 ) dependent variations of the observation system and/or atmospheric differential extinction for all time - series ccd frames @xcite .",
    "we examined light variations of about 12,000 stars by visual inspection . excluding saturated stars brighter than @xmath1 = 13 and 10 mag in the long and short exposure images , respectively , we identified 24 variable stars in the observing field . among these",
    ", 17 ( kv1 - kv17 ) variables were newly discovered by our observations . a finding chart of variable stars is shown in figure 1 .",
    "basic properties including mean magnitude @xmath27@xmath1@xmath28 , mean color @xmath27@xmath28 , and variable types of variable stars are presented in table 1 .",
    "we derived the periods of variable stars using the discrete fourier analysis @xcite .",
    "especially , for all stars in the @xmath3 scuti instability strip , we investigated the signal to noise amplitude ratio ( s / n ) of a frequency with the biggest power in a power spectrum of each star , in order to search for variability .",
    "the s / n ratio greater than 4.0 @xcite has been used as a detection criterion of pulsating frequencies ; for example , analysis of the @xmath3 scuti - type star 57 tau by @xcite .",
    "@xcite discovered seven ( v1 - v7 ) variable stars in the field of ngc 2099 through the time - series measurements with @xmath29 filter .",
    "table 2 compares the basic properties of variables obtained from our data with those of @xcite .",
    "they suggested that two ( v1 and v2 ) stars are long period eclipsing binary candidates without any definite period determinations .",
    "three ( v3 , v4 , and v7 ) of them were considered to be w uma - type eclipsing binaries .",
    "the other two ( v5 and v6 ) stars were suggested to be high - amplitude @xmath3 scuti - type stars .    from the detection of only one deep minimum in their light curves of v1 and v2 , @xcite classified these stars as long period binaries .",
    "however , we could not determine period and epoch of minimum , since most of their observations showed no significant light variation . as shown in the upper panels of figure 2 , any distinct feature of light variations of v1 and v2",
    "were not found . due to our limited data points obtained from short observing run ( @xmath4 10 hours )",
    ", we failed to detect any fading and to confirm the characteristics of these two stars .",
    "more time - series observations with long observing run should be made in order to clarify the properties of these stars .",
    "lower panels of figure 2 show the overall shape of our phase diagrams for other five variables which are in good agreements with those of @xcite . especially , we could determine more accurate periods and epochs for all variables since we have much more data points which fully cover the phase diagrams .",
    "the light curves of v3 , v4 , and v7 show typical shapes of w uma - type binary .",
    "especially , our data for v7 show remarkably clear and complete light curve compared to the previous one of @xcite , which allows us to verify this star as a typical w uma - type binary .",
    "we confirmed that v3 and v4 show slightly different brightness of maxima between the orbital phases of 0.25 and of 0.75 , which gives us a hint for the existence of spots on the stellar surface @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that v5 might be high - amplitude @xmath3 scuti - type star or field rrc - type star .",
    "however , our light curve shows that v5 has a typical shape of rrc - type star rather than that of high amplitude @xmath3 scuti - type star .",
    "our light curves of v6 together with @xcite definitely show a characteristic of high - amplitude @xmath3 scuti - type star .",
    "we applied the multi - frequency analysis @xcite to the data of v5 and v6 .",
    "v5 does not show any significant peak on the frequency spectra after prewhitening the main frequency of @xmath30 = 3.588 c / d ( cycles per day ) .",
    "for the variable v6 , we found two frequencies of @xmath30 = 9.104 c / d with amplitude of @xmath31 = 204.2@xmath321.4 mmag ( s / n = 37.2 ) and @xmath33 = 15.016 c / d with amplitude of @xmath34 = 32.7@xmath321.4 mmag ( s / n = 14.1 ) .",
    "the frequency ratio of @xmath30/@xmath33 = 0.606 is very similar to that of theoretical radial modes @xmath35 = 0.616 @xcite , indicating that @xmath30 is a fundamental radial mode ( f - mode ; @xmath36 ) and @xmath33 is a 2nd overtone radial mode ( 2h - mode ; @xmath37 ) .",
    "these indicate that v6 is a high amplitude @xmath3 scuti - type star with double radial modes of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the larger dispersion shown in the phase diagram of v6 is caused by the double - mode nature of pulsation .",
    "among 17 new variable stars discovered by our observations , nine stars are identified as pulsating variables with characteristics of @xmath3 scuti - type star ( see table 1 for identification ) . in table 3",
    ", we list the pulsating frequencies of new variable stars derived from the multiple frequency analysis @xcite .",
    "their power spectra are shown in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "light variations and phase diagrams of nine @xmath3 scuti - type stars are shown in figures 5 and 6 .",
    "the solid lines in figure 5 represent synthetic curves computed from our multiple frequency analysis .",
    "the data of kv1 and kv2 are obtained from only short exposure observations due to their saturation in long exposure images .",
    "they have only one and two frequencies , respectively , with small amplitudes .",
    "although we have short time span of the short exposure observations for these stars , we suggest that they are @xmath3 scuti - type star ( kv1 ) and @xmath3 scuti - type star candidate ( kv2 ) .",
    "five ( kv3 , kv4 , kv5 , kv6 , and kv8 ) variable stars have more than three frequencies .",
    "they show frequencies in the range of 7.937 c / d @xmath4",
    "16.478 c / d which are typical values for the @xmath3 scuti - type stars .",
    "they have closely - separated frequencies ( frequency ratio around 1.0 : @xmath33/@xmath38 = 0.948 for kv3 , @xmath30/@xmath39 = 1.037 for kv4 , @xmath30/@xmath38 = 0.979 for kv5 , @xmath30/@xmath33 = 0.959 for kv6 , and @xmath30/@xmath33 = 0.971 for kv8 ) , which indicate the excitation of non - radial modes @xcite . in the case of kv7",
    ", we detected only one frequency of f@xmath40 = 24.308 c / d with large power , which is the typical frequency for the @xmath3 scuti - type stars .",
    "although kv9 shows some scatter on the phase diagram , we detected one dominant frequency of f@xmath40 = 13.020 c / d with large s / n ratio of 8.0 .",
    "thus we suggest that kv9 is a @xmath3 scuti - type star candidate .",
    "we discovered seven new eclipsing binaries , which show clear characteristics of w uma - type binary except for kv12 ( see table 1 for the identification ) . in figure 7 , we show the phase diagrams for these newly discovered eclipsing binaries .",
    "we determined their orbital periods using the phase - match technique @xcite .",
    "kv11 shows the shallow secondary maximum ( around orbital phase 0.75 ) and a hump just after the secondary eclipse , which is possibly due to the existence of surface inhomogeneity , i.e. effect of the spot .",
    "although definite type of kv12 is ambiguous due to its incomplete light curve , it also appears to be an eclipsing binary . kv13 and",
    "kv15 show the most clear and typical w uma - type light curves , with slightly different brightness of maxima probably due to the existence of a spot on the stellar surface .",
    "although there are some scatters over the whole phase of light curves of kv14 , kv16 , and kv17 , they also appear to be w uma - type binaries . in table 4 , we summarize light curve parameters ( period , epoch of minimum , and amplitude ) of these eclipsing binaries .",
    "among the new variable stars discovered from our observations , kv10 is the most interesting object with complex light variations . from our multiple frequency analysis @xcite",
    ", we found that kv10 has two frequencies with similar amplitudes : @xmath30 = 22.796 c / d ( high ) with 32.9 mmag and @xmath33 = 2.396 c / d ( low ) with 24.2 mmag .",
    "figure 8 displays the complex light variations of kv10 .",
    "upper panel shows original light variations .",
    "lower panels are phase diagrams of residuals obtained from the subtraction of @xmath30 to the data , assuming two different periods of 1/@xmath33 = 0.417 day or two times of it",
    ".    there might be two possible interpretations for these peculiar light variations of kv10 .",
    "first , kv10 can be a hybrid pulsator to be excited in both @xmath7 doradus - type g - mode with a period of 0.417 day and @xmath3 scuti - type p - mode with a period of 0.044 day .",
    "this kind of hybrid pulsation has been known for two stars of hd 8801 @xcite and hd 209295 @xcite .",
    "second , kv10 may be a binary system with an orbital period of 0.835 day with ellipsoidal variations and one of the components in this binary system is a @xmath3 scuti - type pulsator . if the binary system has a semi - detached configuration , one of the components fills its roche lobe and then makes ellipsoidal variations with its rotation . for example , from the photometric and spectroscopic observations of a triple system hd 207651 , @xcite found two frequencies of 15.45 c / d resulted from @xmath3 scuti - type pulsation and 1.36 c / d from ellipsoidal variation . on the other hand ,",
    "a few tens of @xmath3 scuti - type pulsating components in semi - detached eclipsing binary systems have been discovered ( see the recent catalogue by * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "judging from the available near - infrared color indices from the 2mass data ( from the simbad ) , ( @xmath41 ) = 0.448@xmath320.135 and ( @xmath42 ) = 0.451@xmath320.157 , kv10 seems to be late g or early k type star ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* table ii ) .",
    "this indicates that kv10 may not be an example of hybrid pulsator with a - f spectral type exhibiting both @xmath3 scuti - type and @xmath7 doradus - type pulsations .",
    "therefore , we prefer the second interpretation , i.e. kv10 is a semi - detached binary system with an orbital period of 0.835 day whose primary component is a @xmath3 scuti - type pulsator and secondary one is a late - type giant to fill its roche lobe inducing ellipsoidal variations .",
    "the observed cmd of ngc 2099 is shown in figure 9 .",
    "the thick and thin solid lines represent adopted empirical zero - age main sequence ( zams ) from @xcite and theoretical isochrone with log t = 8.65 and z = 0.019 @xcite , respectively .",
    "the best fit of the zams and isochrone to the observed cmd gives the interstellar reddening of e(@xmath43 ) = 0.21 and the distance modulus of ( @xmath44)@xmath45 = 11.4 .",
    "these values are in good agreements with the previous results by @xcite ; e(@xmath43 ) = 0.21 and ( @xmath44)@xmath45 = 11.55 .    in figure 9",
    ", we show the position of 24 variable stars . among 224 stars within the @xmath3 scuti instability strip , only two ( kv1 and kv2 ) @xmath3",
    "scuti - type stars are detected .",
    "these two @xmath3 scuti - type stars have the lowest amplitudes of about @xmath46@xmath1 @xmath4 0.02 mag among our newly discovered variables .",
    "the membership probability of kv1 based on the proper motion data by @xcite indicates 0.90 , which confirms kv1 as a possible member star in the cluster . assuming that most of the stars in the instability strip are cluster members , the fraction of variable stars in the instability strip is less than 1% .",
    "this incidence of variable stars in ngc 2099 is much lower than the case of field stars with about 30% @xcite and of some open clusters comparable to that of field stars @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the low incidence of @xmath3 scuti - type stars in ngc 2099 is in line with the cases of other many open clusters ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we should note that our detection of variable stars near the @xmath3 scuti instability strip are relied on the short exposure time data set with short time span , which are not enough to detect all multi - periodic small - amplitude @xmath3 scuti - type stars in this cluster .    besides the kv1 and kv2 ,",
    "the other eight @xmath3 scuti - type stars are deviated from the location of instability strip .",
    "they are fainter than the stars in the instability strip , indicating that they are not likely to be member stars in this cluster .",
    "according to their locations on the cmd , one peculiar variable kv10 and one rrc - type star v5 also are much less likely the member stars . based on the analysis of empirical period - luminosity relation",
    ", @xcite also suggested that v5 and v6 are too faint to be bona - fide cluster member stars .",
    "as for the membership of eclipsing binary stars , we only consider three ( v1 , v2 , and v4 ) binaries as possible members of the cluster , since they are brighter ( @xmath27 1 mag ) than the main sequence for a given color , i.e. within the binary sequence .",
    "another binaries fainter than the main - sequence should be field objects .",
    "however , two ( kv12 and kv14 ) stars , which are slightly fainter than the main - sequence , can be marginal member stars considering their magnitude and color errors .",
    "in the present study , we discovered nine @xmath3 scuti - type stars , seven eclipsing binaries , and one peculiar variable in the field of open cluster ngc 2099 .",
    "we also confirmed the identifications of five previously known variables by @xcite . while a number of stars are found in the @xmath3 scuti instability strip of this cluster , we only detected two small amplitude @xmath3 scuti - type stars .",
    "the other eight @xmath3 scuti - type stars might be projected field stars , according to their locations in the cmd deviated to the @xmath3 scuti instability strip .",
    "this is supported by the serious field star contamination due to the proximity of this cluster to the galactic plane . among seven",
    "newly discovered eclipsing binaries in our observations , six stars are w uma - type binaries while one binary star is not clearly classified due to its incomplete phase diagram .",
    "kv10 shows peculiar light variations of @xmath3 scuti - type short - periodic component combined with another long - periodic ones .",
    "the long - periodic variations can be interpreted by @xmath7 doradus - type pulsations or ellipsoidal variations . because the former interpretation could not match with the infrared color indices of kv10",
    ", we prefer the possibility of ellipsoidal variations .",
    "further spectroscopic or more precise multi - band photometric observations are needed to define physical characteristics of this interesting object .",
