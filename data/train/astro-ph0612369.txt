    "results from recent x - ray surveys have made very significant contributions to understanding formation and evolution of supermassive blackholes ( smbhs ) at galaxy centers .",
    "in particular , studies of x - ray luminosity function and its evolution have been providing the most reliable current estimates of the accretion history to smbh .",
    "one of the most important findings in recent years is that luminous active galactic nuclei ( agns ) arise earlier in the history of the universe than lower luminosity ones @xcite .",
    "this suggests that more massive smbhs have been formed earlier in the universe , and reside quiescently at the centers of giant elliptical galaxies in the later epochs , while more numerous , less massive smbhs have been formed and accreted later in the history of the universe .",
    "clustering properties of agns and their evolution with redshift provide yet additional clues to understanding the accretion processes onto the smbhs .",
    "these give clues to environments of agn activities . in the framework of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) structure formation scenario , clustering properties or the bias of agns over a sufficiently large scale @xmath15",
    "may be related to the typical mass of dark matter halos in which they reside , @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the mechanisms of triggering the agn activity , which might be closely related to galaxy interactions and/or merging @xcite , yield a clustering of agns and can therefore be infered from the clustering analysis .",
    "since strong x - ray emission is a typical feature of an agn activity , x - ray surveys provide most efficient means of constructing comprehensive complete samples of agns without contamination from the light in the stellar population of host galaxies .",
    "in particular , surveys in the harder ( @xmath16 kev ) x - ray band such as available from _ xmm - newton _ are very efficient in finding not only unobscured agns , which are relatively easy to select also in the optical bands , but also obscured ones , which are difficult to select with optical selection criteria alone .",
    "this is important because most of the accretion ( @xmath17% ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) occurs in agns obscured by gas ( in x - ray bands ) and dust ( in the optical bands ) .",
    "while one approach in investigating the environment of agns is to measure agn overdensities around known clusters of galaxies @xcite , a more common and direct measure can be obtained by calculating auto - correlation functions ( acfs ) of well - defined samples of x - ray selected agns .",
    "while small number statistics limits the accuracy of the clustering measurements of x - ray selected agns , there are a number of reports on the detection of the correlation signals .",
    "samples based on the _ rosat _ all - sky survey have mainly constrained the clustering properties of type 1 local agns at @xmath18 .",
    "the correlation lengths resulting from the angular @xcite and 3d @xcite analyses of these samples are 6 - 7 @xmath10 mpc .",
    "@xmath19 due to the wide redshift distribution , it is more difficult to obtain clustering signal in deeper x - ray surveys before redshifts for a complete set of x - ray sources are obtained .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite measured strong angular correlation signals in their _ xmm - newton_/2df survey , which covers a total area of 2 deg@xmath1 over two fields .",
    "they obtained a correlation length of @xmath20 mpc in physical units for both soft and hard x - ray selected sources , suggesting a clustering evolution which is fixed in the proper coordinate between z@xmath21 and @xmath22 . at much fainter x - ray fluxes",
    ", @xcite analyzed the projected - distance correlation function @xmath23 for the x - ray sources with spectroscopic redshifts in the chandra deep fields north ( cdf - n ) and south ( cdf - s ) .",
    "they found significantly different clustering properties in these two fields , suggesting a cosmic variance effect .",
    "recently , @xcite made detailed analysis on their 0.4 deg@xmath1 _ chandra _ large area synoptic x - ray survey ( clasxs ) supplemented by cdf - n . with spectroscopic redshifts for a good portion of the sources",
    ", they explored the clustering properties in different redshift and luminosity bins as well as intrinsic absorption bins .",
    "they found the evolution of bias with redshift but they did not find significant dependence in the clustering properties of x - ray selected agns based on either luminosity or intrinsic absorption .",
    "one of the main aims of the cosmos @xcite project is to trace the evolution of the large - scale structure of the universe with an unprecedented accuracy and redshift baseline .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ survey , covering the entire cosmos field ( xmm - cosmos ; * ? ? ? * ) , is one of the most extensive _ xmm - newton _",
    "survey programs conducted so far . in the first - year _ xmm - newton _ observations , about 1400 x - ray point sources have been detected and cataloged @xcite ( hereafter c07 ) , which are dominated by agns at redshifts @xmath24 @xcite .    in this paper , we report the first results of our investigations on the large scale structure through an angular auto - correlation ( acf ) function analysis of the x - ray point sources detected in xmm - cosmos , as a preview of more detailed studies in the near future .",
    "our future studies include the derivation of the direct three - dimensional correlation function using redshift information already available for a large portion of the x - ray sources and the analysis of the cross - correlation of the x - ray sources with galaxies in the multiwavelength cosmos catalog .",

    "the applied criteria for this kind of analysis should be stricter than those adopted for the derivation of the @xmath25 function , because localized systematic errors may cause spurious clustering of x - ray sources . in order to do this , we have scaled up the original sensitivity map to : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the limiting count rate ( in cts  s@xmath28 ) in the original c06 sensitivity map and @xmath29 is the sensitivity map used for the acf analysis . after a number of trials , the scaling coefficients @xmath30 have been set to ( 1.33,@xmath31 ) , ( 1.40 , 0 . ) and ( 1.44 , @xmath32 ) for the sft , med and uhd bands respectively .",
    "we have excluded the area where @xmath29 exceeds @xmath33 ( low exposure areas close to the field borders ) . those x - ray sources with @xmath34 s below @xmath29 at the source position have been excluded from the acf analysis .",
    "after these screenings , the numbers of sources for the acf analysis are 1037 , 545 , and 151 for the sft , med , and uhd bands respectively . while the sensitivity in the soft band is the best among the three bands , some x - ray sources are hard enough that they are detected in only med and/or uhd bands . these are mainly highly obscured agns . out of the 545 ( 151 )",
    "med ( uhd ) band sources after the screening process , 59 ( 13 ) have not been detected in the sft band , and only one uhd sources have escaped the detection in the med band ( before the screening process ) .",
    "the numbers of the x - ray sources , values of @xmath35,@xmath33 and the total areas used for the acf analysis are summarized in table  [ tab : src ] .",
    "in calculating the binned acf , we have used the standard estimator by @xcite : @xmath36 where dd , dr , and rr are the normalized numbers of pairs in the @xmath37-th angular bin for the data - data , data - random , and random - random samples respectively .",

    "our _ xmm - newton _ observations have varying sensitivity over the field .",
    "in order to create a random sample , which takes the inhomogeneity of the sensitivity over the field into account , we have taken the following steps .    1 .",
    "make a random sample composed of @xmath45 objects , where @xmath45 is an integer times @xmath44 .",
    "2 .   for each random object ,",
    "assign a count rate from a source from the data sample .",

    "repeat this until the position is sensitive enough to detect a point - source with the assigned cr .    as a check on this procedure ,",
    "we have also calculated acfs using two other methods of generating random samples .",
    "the second method is to assign the count rates to the random sources drawn from a @xmath47 ",

    "* ) , instead of copying the count rates of the data sample",
    ". then the source is placed at a random position in the field .",
    "if the sensitivity limit at this position is higher than the assigned cr , this random source is rejected .",
    "another , but more sophisticated and computationally demanding method is to generate random sources based on the @xmath47 ",
    "@xmath49 relation , down to a flux level much lower than the sensitivity limit of our observations .",
    "these sources are then fed into a simulator , taking into account _ xmm - newton _ instrumental effects , including position - dependent psf , exposure maps , and particle background .",
    "the entire first - year xmm - cosmos image has been simulated and the same source detection procedure as that applied to the actual data has been applied on the simulated data .",

    "we have estimated the errors using the variance of the calculated acf by replacing @xmath38 in eq .",

    "this scaling factor corrects for the difference between the errors in the null - hypothesis case , obtained from @xmath50s , and those in the presence of the correlation signal .",
    "this is in line with the observation that the error in each bin of the acf calculated using the @xcite estimator is approximately a poisson fluctuation of the number of data - data pairs in the bin , i.e. , @xmath54/\\sqrt{n_{\\rm pair , dd}}$ ] .",

    "the errors in different angular bins are not independent from one another and correlations among the errors have to be taken into account when we make function fits .",

    "[ eq : cov ] only takes into account the correlations of errors for the random cases , but not the correlation of errors due to clustering .",
    "one way of explaining this is that removing / adding one source ( by a poisson chance ) affects multiple angular bins and this is represented by non - diagonal elements of eq .",
    "[ eq : cov ] .",
    "on the other hand , correlation of errors due to large scale structure or the cosmic variance is not represented by this .",
    "if we observe another part of the sky , we sample different sets of large scale structures such as filaments and voids .",

    "one way to include also the latter effect is to use the jackknife re - sampling technique , as was done by e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , the jackknife re - sampling requires to divide the sample into many statistically independent regions , which is not practically possible in our case .",
    "the acfs have been calculated for the three bands in logarithmically equally spaced bins with @xmath64 . the results are shown in fig [ fig : acf3 ] , where the upper panels , composed of two layers of logarithmic plots with positive and negative parts ( @xmath65 respectively ) , are attached together .",

    "positive signals have been detected down to @xmath66 in the 0.5 - 2 kev band and @xmath67 in the other bands . at the smallest scales ,",
    "correlation signal is negative , probably due to confusion effects , where two sources separated by a distance comparable to or closer than the point spread function ( psf ) can not be detected separately in the source detection procedure and may well be classified as one extended source . in our current sample , the sources that have been classified as extended have been removed from the sample . the effect of this is discussed in detail in sect .",

    "in the 0.5 - 2 and 2 - 4.5 kev bands , positive signals extend out to @xmath68 .",
    "negative signals are seen at the largest angular scales , probably due to the integral constraint as discussed below .          in order to make a simple characterization of our acf results ,",
    "we have fitted the acf with a power - law model of the form : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the slope index of the corresponding three - dimensional correlation function .",
    "we use the normalization @xmath71 as a fitting parameter rather than the angular correlation length @xmath72 , since this gives much better convergence of the fit .",
    "the fits are made by minimizing @xmath73 .",
    "the subscript @xmath74 denotes that the correlations between errors have been taken into account through the inverse of the covariance matrix : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a vector composed of @xmath77 , @xmath78 is the covariance matrix calculated in eq .",
    "[ eq : cov ] with @xmath60 , and @xmath79 is a constant to compensate for the integral constraint as discussed below .    due to the finite area and the construction of @xmath46 in eq .",
    "[ eq : ls ] , the estimated angular correlation function satisfies the integral constraint ( e.g * ? ? ?",

    "* ) : @xmath80 this constraint usually results in @xmath46 underestimating the true underlying angular correlation function by the constant @xmath79 . under an assumption that the true underlying @xmath81 is a power - law and",
    "is extended to the scale of the survey area , one can include @xmath79 in the fitting process , where @xmath79 can be uniquely determined by @xmath82 and @xmath70 by imposing the integral constraint @xcite , @xmath83 where the sums are over angular bins and @xmath84 is the number of random - random pairs in the @xmath37-th angular bin .",
    "the above assumption is not necessarily true .",
    "if residual systematic errors in the sensitivity maps are the main cause of the negative values at large angular separations , the determination of @xmath79 shown above is not valid .",

    "[ sec:3d ] .",
    "the rationale for the maximum scale is that , in our subsequent analysis , the correlation functions are converted to the root mean square ( rms ) density fluctuation with a @xmath94 mpc - radius sphere ( therefore the relevant maximum separation is @xmath95 ) in discussing bias parameters .",
    "the rationale for the minimum scale is to minimize the effects of non - linearity in discussing the bias parameters and typical halo masses .      the _ amplification bias _ ,",
    "due to which the estimated acf from sources detected in a smoothed image ( e.g. by a finite psf ) is amplified with respect to the true underlying acf , has been first noted and discussed by @xcite in the context of the clustering of x - ray sources .",
    "this is caused by merging of multiple sources which are separated by distances comparable to or closer than the psf .",
    "the effect of this bias depends on the true underlying angular correlation function and the number density of the sources . in principle , full simulations involving psf smoothing and the source detection process are required to estimate the amount of this bias .",
    "@xcite took a simplified approach in estimating this effect on their acf from their _ xmm - newton_/2df survey . in order to estimate the size of the effect , they used particles sampled from a cosmological simulation",

    "they then compared the angular acfs from the particles themselves and the simulated _ xmm - newton _ sources . as a result , they estimated that the measured angular correlation length is overestimated by 3 - 4% due to the amplification bias .    in our case with xmm - cosmos , we have explicitly excluded sources that are classified as extended by the source detection procedure ( c06 ) .",
    "this causes most of the source pairs closer than @xmath97 to disappear from the sample , since these pairs are classified as single extended sources .",
    "because the exclusion of these sources can suppress the estimated angular correlation function , we use the term `` psf merging bias '' rather than the `` amplification bias '' .",

    "<S> we present the first results of the measurements of angular auto - correlation functions ( acfs ) of x - ray point sources detected in the _ xmm - newton _ observations of the @xmath0 2 deg@xmath1 cosmos field ( xmm - cosmos ) . </S>",
    "<S> a significant positive signals have been detected in the 0.5 - 2 ( sft ) band , in the angle range of 0.5 - 24 arcminutes , while the positive signals were at the @xmath02 and @xmath2 levels in the 2 - 4.5 ( med ) and 4.5 - 10 ( uhd ) kev bands respectively . </S>",
    "<S> correctly taking integral constraints into account is a major limitation in interpreting our results . with power - law </S>",
    "<S> fits to the acfs without the integral constraint term , we find correlation lengths of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 for the sft , med , and uhd bands respectively for @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the inferred comoving correlation lengths , also taking into account the bias by the source merging due to _ xmm - newton _ psf , are @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xmath10 mpc at the effective redshifts of @xmath11 1.1 , 0.9 , and 0.6 for the sft , med , and uhd bands respectively . </S>",
    "<S> if we include the integral constraint term in the fitting process , assuming that the power - law extends to the scale length of the entire xmm - cosmos field , the correlation lengths become larger by @xmath12%90% . comparing the inferred rms fluctuations of the spatial distribution of agns @xmath13 with those of the underlying mass , the bias parameters of the x - ray source clustering at these effective redshifts are in the range @xmath14 . </S>"
