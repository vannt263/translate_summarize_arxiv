    "the study of topological states of matter has received a large increase of interest since the theoretical formulation@xcite and experimental observation@xcite of the quantum spin hall effect . besides the quantum hall and quantum spin hall effects in two dimensions , several other topological states of matter have been studied , e.g. , topological insulators in three dimensions@xcite and topological superconductors,@xcite and they have been classified in a systematic fashion.@xcite this classification is based on the notion of topological invariants ; in the quantum hall and spin hall systems , these invariants are closely related to the quantized hall and spin hall conductivities , respectively .",
    "these conductivities can be observed when the bulk is in an insulating phase ; they are edge properties that exist inside the bulk gaps .",
    "remarkably , these quantities are closely related to the topological invariants of the bulk bands known as the chern numbers , a property known as the bulk - boundary correspondence .",
    "importantly , these chern numbers make it possible to classify the topological phases of the system , without having to study the physics on the edges .",
    "phase transitions between these topological phases are as appealing as the phases themselves .",
    "topological phase transitions are characterized by a change of the topological invariants that classify the system .",
    "because of the topological protection , they can occur only when a gap closes . in that case , the chern numbers of the energy bands change.@xcite several mechanisms can give rise to these transitions .",
    "for instance , in the model by kane and mele,@xcite it has been shown that by increasing the rashba spin - orbit coupling one can close the quantum spin hall gap and open a trivial one",
    ". other types of transitions , between different chiral states , occur in the hofstadter model , and are driven by variation of the magnetic flux density.@xcite more recently , it has been shown that the intrinsic spin - orbit coupling also drives phase transitions in the honeycomb lattice in the presence of magnetic flux.@xcite in this work , we show that in several two - dimensional lattices topological phase transitions can be driven by tuning the strength of a real next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) hopping term .",
    "although in tight - binding models this term resembles the intrinsic spin - orbit ( iso ) coupling ( which is a purely imaginary nnn hopping term ) , it is often neglected , despite the fact that in some systems it may be much stronger than the iso coupling .    experiments incorporating ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices are ideal candidates for the realization of topological phase transitions , since the strengths of the different hopping parameters can be tuned relatively easily . in the mostly realized square optical lattices ,",
    "the potential in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 directions is usually separable and the nnn hopping ( along the diagonal ) is zero . for nonseparable optical lattices ,",
    "the magnitude of the nnn hopping @xmath3 is small compared to that of the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) hopping @xmath4 .",
    "however , it has been recently shown that by shaking the optical lattice the effective ratio @xmath5 can be varied in the entire range from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "this occurs because , in a certain regime of parameters , the shaking leads to a renormalization of the hopping , which becomes multiplied by a bessel function , i.e. , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the shaking parameter , given by the ratio between the amplitude @xmath10 and the frequency @xmath11 of the periodic shaking.@xcite moreover , the nnn hopping may get renormalized by a bessel function with a different argument , thus leading to a full range of possible values for the effective ratio @xmath5.@xcite    here , we focus on tight - binding models , where we assume that all particles loaded onto the lattice are in their respective ground states , and we study topological phase transitions driven by tuning the ratio is the relevant tuning parameter . ] @xmath12 in the presence of iso coupling . in this aspect",
    ", we study several lattice geometries .",
    "the honeycomb lattice ( e.g. , of graphene ) is one of the most famous systems exhibiting a dirac dispersion , where iso coupling leads to the quantum spin hall phase .",
    "however , the fact that there are only two ( spin - degenerate ) bands , and hence only one gap , greatly reduces the possible types of topological phase transitions that could occur . in the kagome , @xmath0 , and lieb lattices ,",
    "the spectrum consists of three bands , and hence two gaps , increasing the number of possible topological phase transitions . in this work ,",
    "we discuss these three lattices and compare the topological phases and topological phase transitions that they exhibit .",
    "the general tight - binding hamiltonian , that applies to all lattices presented in this work , reads @xmath13 with @xmath14 here , @xmath15",
    "( @xmath16 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator for a particle on site @xmath17 and with spin @xmath18 .",
    "the first two terms @xmath19 and @xmath20 describe nn and nnn hopping , respectively .",
    "the third term @xmath21 is the iso coupling ; in this term , we have defined the unit vector @xmath22 in terms of the bond vectors @xmath23 and @xmath24 , that connects the sites @xmath17 and @xmath25 via the unique intermediate site @xmath26 .",

    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sect_lieb ]",
    ", we apply the tight - binding model to the lieb lattice , study the spectrum , and analyze the topological phase transitions using the chern numbers of the bands . in section",
    "[ sect_kagome ] , we repeat this discussion for the kagome and @xmath0 lattices . in section  [ sect_honeycomb ] , we study a honeycomb lattice and show that contrarily to the other two examples , no topological phase transitions driven by the real nnn hopping can occur , unless a magnetic field is applied perpendicularly to the lattice .",

    "the hamiltonian matrix @xmath49 consists of two uncoupled blocks corresponding to the spin up and spin down projections , related by time - reversal symmetry , i.e. , @xmath50 . due to the time - reversal and inversion symmetries , the iso coupling is unable to lift the spin degeneracy . for the calculation of the energy spectrum",
    ", it thus suffices to restrict our attention to one spin component , while keeping in mind that the resulting bands are doubly degenerate . in the following",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to the spin - up part of the hamiltonian .",

    "( b ) a gap appears if the iso coupling is turned on ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) . ]",
    "let us first consider the case where only nn hopping is included ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the spectrum then consists of three bands ( per spin component ) , where two dispersing bands touch the flat middle band via a conelike dispersion at the @xmath34 point ; see fig .",
    "[ fig_isogap](a ) .",
    "there is only one such point in the 1bz.@xcite since the nielsen - ninomiya theorem does not apply here due to the flat band , there is no fermion doubling .",

    "[ fig_isogap](b ) . as shown in refs .",
    ", the resulting gaps are nontrivial , i.e. , they exhibit helical edge states , and the upper and lower bands have nonzero chern numbers . for the definition of the chern numbers and for an analytic derivation in the case of the lieb lattice with iso coupling , we refer to the appendix . in this case , the result of this computation is @xmath56 , for the chern numbers of the lower , middle , and upper band , respectively , for the spin - up component . for the spin - down component",
    ", we have @xmath57 . from this property",
    ", we immediately obtain the chern numbers for @xmath58 from those for @xmath59 by interchanging the roles for spin up and spin down .",
    "since the hamiltonian is diagonal in spin space , we can define the spin chern number as @xmath60 .",
    "due to the symmetry between the two spin components , it holds that @xmath61 . by virtue of the bulk - boundary correspondence , the spin hall conductivity ( in units of the spin conductivity quantum @xmath62 ) equals @xmath63 where the summation is over the filled bands ( @xmath64 is the fermi energy ) .",
    "the @xmath65-index @xmath66 ( defined as @xmath6 for an even and @xmath67 for an odd number of edge - state pairs ) is then related to spin hall conductivity by @xmath68 . an alternative way to derive the chern numbers and the spin hall conductivities is by diagonalizing the system in a ribbon geometry , and to count the number of edge states that appear inside the bulk gaps.@xcite we remark that for systems that respect inversion symmetry , the @xmath65 invariant can also be calculated using the parity eigenvalues at the time - reversal symmetric momenta.@xcite the advantage of computing the spin chern numbers , as we do here , is that they are directly related to the quantized spin hall conductivity in the band gaps .",
    "now , let us investigate the effects of a purely real nnn hopping ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) .",
    "unlike the iso coupling , the real nnn term breaks the particle - hole symmetry of the spectrum .",
    "this case is , in some sense , more complicated than the previous one , because the hamiltonian matrix can not be written in the form @xmath71 , with @xmath72 a three - component vector of matrices that form a basis for a representation of @xmath73 .",
    "however , it is still possible to extend the components of @xmath72 to a basis of @xmath74 .",

    "this expression may be found using the luttinger - kohn representation@xcite of the bands at the band touching points .",

    "we remark that the maximum - tilt condition as defined in ref .",
    "is not satisfied for these cones . in addition , the hamiltonian is only of limited interest for our purposes because by itself it does not reproduce the topological properties that we analyze .",
    "the most general case is when both the real and imaginary parts of the nnn hopping are included , @xmath69 and @xmath55 . in this case",
    ", the iso term opens a gap at @xmath34 .",
    "regarding the chern numbers of the bands , we immediately understand the case @xmath93 : such a state is adiabatically connected to the case for which @xmath53 , and no gaps close in this regime , so that the chern numbers of the bands are exactly the same as if one would put @xmath53 .",
    "the situation is , however , more subtle for @xmath77 .",
    "as mentioned previously , a band touching point occurs at the @xmath31 point for @xmath94 .",
    "interestingly , this still occurs in the presence of iso coupling , since its contribution to the hamiltonian [ see eq .  ] vanishes at @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the @xmath31 point is protected from the effects of the iso coupling .",
    "because the upper and middle band do touch when @xmath3 is increased to @xmath95 , the chern numbers of the bands may change .",
    "an analytical evaluation of the chern numbers is in principle possible , but the expressions become tedious to deal with . for this reason , we choose to compute the chern numbers numerically by resorting to the method proposed by fukui _",
    "et al_.@xcite for the case @xmath53 , the analytical results from a computation similar to the one presented in ref .",
    "coincide with our numerical findings .     and",
    "the blue continuous curves indicate the situation for @xmath96 .",
    "there is no full gap when @xmath97 is below a critical value @xmath98 .",
    "( b ) for a sufficiently large @xmath99 , the spectrum is fully gapped . ]    before we present the results from this calculation , we would like to point out a subtlety that arises in the interpretation of the chern numbers in terms of the spin hall conductivity .",
    "for the latter quantity to be quantized , there must be a full gap in the spectrum , i.e. , there must be a range of fermi energies for which there are only edge states and no bulk states .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_gaptypes](a ) , there may be no full band gap between the middle and upper bands , although they are separated at each point in the 1bz .",
    "in this situation , i.e. , if the minimum of the upper band lies at a lower energy value than the maximum of the middle band at a different momentum [ @xmath100 , we say that the spectrum exhibits a negative indirect gap .",
    "the chern numbers of the bands are well defined , since they do not touch anywhere , and no topological phase transition occurs . in this example",
    ", a @xmath101-filled system will always have both the upper band and the middle band partially filled , which would classify the bulk as a semimetal , preventing the helical edge states to be observed . in the semimetallic regime ,",
    "i.e. , with partially filled bands , the spin hall conductivity is not quantized.@xcite for @xmath102 filling , this problem does not occur since in this case there is a full band gap . at this filling",
    ", the system behaves as an insulator and the spin hall conductivity carried by the helical edge states can be experimentally observed . by virtue of symmetry ,",
    "a similar reasoning occurs for @xmath103 , but with the roles of the @xmath102 and @xmath101 filling , and of the lower and upper bands interchanged .",

    "for @xmath109 , the conductivities in the lower ( @xmath102 filling ) and upper ( @xmath101 filling ) gap are equal , since the middle band has zero chern number . for @xmath110 ,",

    "every phase transition in the phase diagram may be understood in terms of the difference in the chern numbers of the phases at both sides of the transition . for the transitions defined by the lines @xmath111 , either the lower or the upper gap closes , and the system behaves as a metal at the gap closing energy ; the other gap is still helical .",
    "for example , if @xmath81 and @xmath59 , the difference of the chern numbers is @xmath112 .",
    "we observe that the change of the chern numbers of the two touching bands is @xmath113 .",
    "this value can be understood from the fact that the bands touch at @xmath31 , and they behave quadratically around this point , i.e. , there is a berry phase of @xmath114 associated to this touching point .",

    "the difference in the chern numbers of the bands between the phases at both sides of the corresponding transitions is an integer multiple of this multiplicity .",

    "we remark that there are other possibilities for real nnn terms as well , but we restrict ourselves to the one given here , because it models hopping between the same pairs of sites as the iso coupling does , namely between two @xmath28 sites or two @xmath29 sites .",

    "at such a transition , the chern numbers of the three bands typically change from @xmath118 to @xmath187 .",

    "the light gray curves are the bulk bands .",
    "the red ( dark gray ) and blue ( medium gray ) curves are the edge states on the two opposite edges of the cylinder .",

    "since both terms in this square root are positive , the bands touch only when @xmath205 ( i.e. , at @xmath206 or @xmath207 ) and @xmath208 ; because @xmath209 , the bands can only touch for @xmath94 . the real nnn hopping has no effect on the touching of the bands ; it merely shifts the energies of both bands up or down .",
    "thus , the conclusion is that , in the honeycomb lattice , there are no phase transitions driven by the real nnn coupling .",
    "the only topological phase transition in this model is the one at @xmath94 , which forms the boundary between two helical phases with opposite signs of the spin hall conductivity .",
    "however , for the honeycomb lattice in a magnetic field , the results are different .",
    "( for the framework of a honeycomb lattice in a magnetic field , see , e.g. ,  refs .  .",

    "( i.e. , quantum hall ) phases only .",
    "due to the spin degeneracy , the chern numbers satisfy @xmath213 , and the hall conductivity is quantized in steps of @xmath214 . in fig .",
    "[ fig_honeycomb](c ) , we have displayed the band structure for the honeycomb lattice under a flux of @xmath102 flux quantum per unit cell . in this case",

    "[ fig_honeycomb](d)[fig_honeycomb](f ) , we show that the gap between the two highest bands closes when varying @xmath12 . in figs .",
    "[ fig_honeycomb](d ) and ( f ) , there are one and two edge - state pairs in the relevant gap , respectively . in addition , the direction of the edge states is flipped .",
    "thus , the hall conductivity inside this gap changes from @xmath215 to @xmath216 ( in units of @xmath217 ; recall that the spin degeneracy yields an additional factor of @xmath177 ) . here , we note that the change of @xmath178 is explained from the fact that there are three inequivalent band touching points in the 1bz due to the fact that there is @xmath102 flux quantum per unit cell , and from the twofold spin degeneracy .    in presence of iso coupling together with the magnetic field , more exotic phase transitions can be expected . in that case , the spin degeneracy is lifted and the condition @xmath218 is generally not satisfied . as a consequence ,",
    "more types of topological phases can be observed than the helical and spin - degenerate chiral phases , e.g. , chiral phases which are not spin degenerate , and even phases which are neither chiral nor helical , but a mixture of both . in refs .  , it has been shown that variation of the iso coupling leads to a topological phase transition between a chiral and a helical state , as well as several transitions between other types of topological phases . if additionally real nnn hopping is present , this picture remains qualitatively unaltered . in conclusion ,",
    "topological phase transitions in the honeycomb lattice subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field can be driven by iso coupling as well as by real nnn hopping .",
    "this conclusion is not only valid for the honeycomb lattice in a magnetic field , but also for the lieb , kagome , and @xmath0 ( among other ) lattices . in case of a magnetic field , there are chiral phases.@xcite if the magnetic field is combined with the iso coupling , also helical phases and nonchiral - nonhelical phases appear . as in the case of the honeycomb lattice ,",
    "there are topological phase transitions between them , driven either by iso coupling or by real nnn hopping .",
    "the theoretical results presented above raise the question whether the transitions driven by real nnn hopping appear in an experimentally accessible regime .",
    "we envisage systems with cold atoms in an optical lattice to be the most promising candidates for observation of these phase transitions , because of the possibility of tuning the hopping parameters . in a static optical lattice ,",
    "@xmath12 is typically of the order of @xmath219,@xcite far from the transitions that happen at @xmath81 .",
    "however , shaken optical lattices exhibit renormalized hopping coefficients , where the bare values become multiplied by a bessel function.@xcite in the most studied case , one applies a periodic shaking to the lattice with the effective potential @xmath220 , where @xmath10 is the amplitude and @xmath11 is the frequency of the shaking .",
    "here , @xmath221 labels the lattice sites in the two - dimensional lattice , @xmath222 is real time , and @xmath223 denotes the density operator at site @xmath221 . in the high - frequency limit @xmath224 , the effective hopping may be determined by applying floquet theory .",
    "one finds that @xmath8 , where the shaking parameter @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , the argument of the bessel function generally differs for nn and nnn hopping ( see , e.g. , ref .   for the case of a non - separable square lattice ) , thus allowing one to tune the ratio @xmath5 in the entire range of possibilities ( @xmath6 to @xmath7 ) .",
    "recently , it has been demonstrated that in the shaken kagome lattice , the band parameters can be controlled such that band touching points are reached.@xcite    the detection of topological phases in optical - lattice experiments presents a challenge because it is impossible to perform ( hall ) conductivity measurements in such systems .",
    "first of all , the atoms are neutral , so that there are no electric currents .",
    "therefore , different detection methods must be envisaged to image the edge states and to determine the topological properties .",
    "recently , there has been a proposal to detect chiral edge states in a hofstadter optical lattice by using angular - momentum sensitive bragg spectroscopy.@xcite additionally , the edge states are probed in a clever way using raman transitions , in order to isolate the edge - state signal from the background .",
    "a second potential problem is the harmonic trap in which the atoms are confined .",
    "the lack of sharp edges means that the notion of edge states is no longer well defined .",
    "this phenomenon is visible in the spectrum of a system in a harmonic background potential : the ordered structure of the spectrum , consisting of the bulk bands and a few edge states in the gaps , is destroyed by this potential.@xcite however , it has been shown that the topological invariants remain well defined in the case of a system with soft edges . in other words , sharp edges are not necessary in order to observe the topological phases.@xcite    besides the more complex optical lattices with multisite unit cells considered here , interesting topological phases may also occur in simpler square lattices loaded with bosons in higher excited states , e.g. , @xmath225 , @xmath226 , and @xmath227 orbitals ( see refs .",
    ", , and , respectively ) . indeed , for a square superlattice with deeper and shallower wells arranged on a checkerboard pattern , it is possible to realize relatively long - lived bose - einstein condensates in the deeper wells which are locally in a metastable @xmath228 or @xmath229 state , whereas the ones in the shallower wells are in an @xmath230-orbital state .",
    "the single - particle spectrum of this system is then very similar to the one of the lieb lattice , which is understood from the formal equivalence of the hamiltonians involving three orbitals per unit cell.@xcite    in conclusion , we have shown that in several dirac - type tight - binding models , it is possible to drive topological phase transitions with the real nnn hopping . in the lieb , kagome , and @xmath0 lattices",
    ", it drives transitions between helical phases with different values of the spin hall conductivity .",
    "this is not true for the honeycomb lattice in zero magnetic field . in a magnetic field ,",
    "the phase transitions are possible . in this aspect ,",
    "we conjecture that it is necessary to have at least two gaps ( three bands ) in order for these phase transitions to appear .",
    "our results could be observed with state - of - the - art shaken optical lattices loaded with fermions .",
    "we thank m. o. goerbig and v. jurii for useful discussions .",
    "this work was supported by the netherlands organisation for scientific research ( nwo ) .",
    "by virtue of the bulk - boundary correspondence,@xcite the chern numbers of the bands yield information about the ( spin ) hall conductivity inside the bulk gaps .",
    "the chern number @xmath231 associated to the band @xmath232 is an integer topological index defined as the integral of the berry curvature over the 1bz,@xcite @xmath233,\\ ] ] where @xmath234 ( @xmath48 ) is the berry connection , defined in terms of the eigenstates @xmath235 of band @xmath232 .",
    "we remark that , for this chern number to be well defined , degeneracies in the spectrum are forbidden .",
    "thus , if two bands touch at a point , the chern numbers of these bands are ill defined .",
    "the problem of the spin degeneracy of the bands in our model is resolved by projecting the system to a single spin component .",
    "thus , we obtain separate chern numbers for the spin - up and the spin - down bands , which we write as @xmath236 and @xmath237 , respectively .    in the case of the lieb lattice with only imaginary nnn hopping ( i.e. , @xmath53 and @xmath59 )",
    ", we can evaluate the chern numbers of the bands analytically . without loss of generality ,",
    "let us focus on the spin - up component and assume @xmath59 .",
    "the hamiltonian can then be written as @xmath238 , where @xmath239 with @xmath240 , @xmath241 and @xmath242 and @xmath243 is the vector of the gell - mann matrices @xmath244 these matrices satisfy the commutation relations @xmath245=i\\epsilon_{ijk}l_k$ ] , so they form a basis for the spin-@xmath67 representation of the lie algebra @xmath73 .",
    "this particular structure of the hamiltonian allows one to calculate the chern numbers analytically since here they have a simple interpretation as a winding number . with a computation analogous to the one presented in ref .",
    ", it may be shown that the berry curvature for the upper and lower band equals @xmath246 with @xmath247 , while for the middle band the berry curvature vanishes .",
    "the integer value of the chern number then follows from interpretation of the integral of the berry curvature as the winding number associated to the vector field @xmath248 .",
    "the result of this computation is @xmath249 and @xmath250.@xcite    in many cases , an analytic computation of the chern numbers is unfeasible due to the complicated dependence of the eigenvectors on the momentum @xmath251 .",
    "in such a case , the chern numbers can be computed numerically from the eigenstates on a discretized lattice of momenta in the 1bz.@xcite it is shown that in order to obtain the correct values of the chern numbers , a small number of discretization steps generally suffices . in this paper , we have used the method explained in ref .  , and we have confirmed the results with those from analytic computations wherever possible .",
