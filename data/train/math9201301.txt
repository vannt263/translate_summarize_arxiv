    "this paper describes some new invariants for triangulations and heegaard diagrams of 3-manifolds .",
    "specifically , for every finite - dimensional , involutory hopf algebra @xmath1 , we define an invariant @xmath2 for closed , oriented 3-manifolds @xmath3 .",
    "the invariants can be extended in various ways to invariants of oriented manifolds with boundary .",
    "we will convert a heegaard diagram to an expression in terms of the structure tensors of a hopf algebra .",
    "the value of the expression is then the value of the invariant . using index notation",
    ", we write @xmath4 and @xmath5 for the multiplication and comultiplication tensors of some involutory hopf algebra , and @xmath6 for the antipode map .",
    "we may consider the set of all expressions in terms of these tensors , modulo the axioms of a hopf algebra , which consist of identities which these tensors satisfy .",
    "we will show that if two ( prime , closed , oriented ) 3-manifolds produce equivalent formal expressions , then they are homeomorphic .",
    "conversely , we may consider the question of determining whether two such expressions are formally equivalent .",
    "for example , is the equation : @xmath7 an identity that follows directly from the axioms of an involutory hopf algebra ?",
    "the answer is yes if and only if two certain oriented 3-manifolds are homeomorphic ( in this case @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) .",
    "this work is part of a new area of mathematics which we will call state model topology , as described in @xcite .",
    "as the starting point of state model topology , we are given a topological object , for example a knot , with a combinatorial description , for example a knot projection .",
    "we wish to find a state model ( or collection of state models ) which we can assign to all such combinatorial descriptions .",
    "we then hope that the partition function of the state model is a topological invariant , i.e. is independent of the chosen combinatorial description . typically , we demonstrate invariance under an appropriate set of local moves on the combinatorial description , for example the three reidemeister moves .",
    "( strictly speaking , the partition function may be a topological `` covariant '' because its value may change in a simple way under some of the moves . )    a _ state model _ @xmath3 consists of a ( commutative ) ring @xmath10 ( usually the complex numbers ) , a bipartite graph @xmath0 , the _ connectivity graph _ , whose",
    "vertices are labeled as _",
    "atoms _ and _ interactions _ ; a set @xmath11 for each atom @xmath12 , called the _ state set _ of @xmath12 ; and a function @xmath13 for each interaction @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 are the neighbors of @xmath14 ) , called the _ weight function _ or the _ boltzmann weights _ of @xmath14 .",
    "a _ state _ of @xmath3 is a function @xmath16 on the atoms of @xmath3 such that @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 of a state @xmath16 is defined as the product of the @xmath19 s evaluated at the state @xmath16 when this product converges , and in particular when @xmath0 is finite .",
    "finally , the _ partition function _",
    "@xmath20 is defined to be the sum of @xmath18 over all states @xmath16 when this sum converges , and in particular all state sets are finite .    ]    to obtain a topological state model , we choose a prescription for assigning a connectivity graph and weight functions to each combinatorial description of a topological object .",
    "for example , if we are given a projection @xmath21 of a link , we can declare the arcs between crossings to be atoms and the crossings themselves to be the interactions .",
    "we choose some @xmath22-element set @xmath23 to be the common state set for all atoms .",
    "if the states of the arcs incident to a given crossing are labeled @xmath24,@xmath25,@xmath26 , and @xmath27 as in figure  [ f : crossing ] , we may define the weight function @xmath28 of a crossing by : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is chosen so that @xmath31 , and @xmath32 when @xmath33 and 0 otherwise .",
    "this state model is a `` link covariant '' called the kauffman bracket , which is essentially the jones polynomial up to normalization .",
    "surprisingly , there are many non - trivial topological state models",
    ". we may start with the general form of such a state model for some kind of combinatorial description , and interpret combinatorial moves as a list of constraints on the weights of the model .",
    "usually there are many more equations than unknowns , and yet the equations have solutions .",
    "for example , the jones and homfly polynomials @xcite and most of their variants and generalizations can be defined as topological state models .",
    "we can conclude that the constraints on the weights of a topological state model have a deep algebraic structure .",
    "indeed , the constraints imposed by invariance under the third reidemeister move are also known as the yang - baxter equations , considered independently in the related area of exactly solved statistical mechanical models @xcite . more recently , many solutions to the yang - baxter equations have been discovered via hopf algebras , or quantum groups , as is summarized in an inspiring paper by drinfeld @xcite .",
    "recently , turaev and reshetikhin have extended this analysis to produce a 3-manifold invariant which generalizes the jones polynomial @xcite .",
    "the new invariants are closely related to other topological invariants .",
    "if we restrict to the special case when @xmath3 is a link complement , we may convert the invariant @xmath2 to a special case of the machinery of drinfeld , turaev , and reshetikhin .",
    "this conversion involves a bigger hopf algebra @xmath34 , the quantum double of @xmath1 , which was defined by drinfeld .",
    "the following is an instructive example of a topological state model .",
    "let @xmath35 be a triangulation of a connected @xmath22-manifold @xmath3 .",
    "we orient the edges of @xmath35 .",
    "we choose a finite group @xmath0 to be the state set , and we declare the edges of @xmath35 to be the atoms . if we assign @xmath36 to an edge with one orientation , we declare this equivalent to assigning @xmath37 to the same edge with the opposite orientation .",
    "we assign interactions to the faces ( 2-simplices ) of @xmath35 . given a state of the model",
    ", the weight of a face is 1 if the cyclically - ordered product of the states of the edges ( when the edges are oriented in the same direction around the face ) of the face is the identity and 0 otherwise .",
    "we leave it as an exercise that the partition function is simply @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the number of vertices of @xmath35 .",
    "thus , the partition function is an invariant after dividing by @xmath40 .",
    "we will see later that this invariant equals @xmath2 when @xmath1 is the group algebra of @xmath0 .",
    "vaughan jones introduced me to state model topology and hopf algebras .",
    "i am also grateful to my advisor , andrew casson ; rob kirby ; and oleg viro for their encouragement and their knowledge of 3-manifold topology .",
    "let @xmath41 be a finite - dimensional vector space over a field @xmath42 .",
    "for most of this paper , a tensor will mean an element of some tensor product space @xmath43 , where each @xmath44 is either @xmath41 or @xmath45 .",
    "we will adopt index notation for tensors as it is defined in @xcite . in index notation ,",
    "a tensor @xmath46 is written as @xmath47 , with @xmath22 indices total , where the @xmath42th index is a superscript ( or contravariant index ) if @xmath48 and a subscript ( or covariant index ) if @xmath49 .",
    "the indices should be distinct letters which have no meaning independent of their use as a description of the tensor @xmath35 .",
    "for example , a vector is written @xmath50 , a dual vector is @xmath51 , a linear operator is @xmath52 , a bilinear form is @xmath53 , and so on . if a tensor @xmath35 has @xmath42 superscripts and @xmath54 subscript , we say that @xmath35 has _ type _",
    "@xmath55 , and _ total type _ @xmath22 .",
    "the indices of a tensor can be used for three different operations on tensors :    1 .",
    ": :    we denote the factor - switching map @xmath56 and its cousins for higher tensor    products by permuting the corresponding indices .",
    "for example , if    @xmath57 , then @xmath36 is a symmetric    bilinear form . 2 .",
    ": :    we write the tensor product of two tensors by juxtaposing the two    tensors and giving them distinct indices .",
    "for example , one may write    @xmath58 if @xmath59 is a linear operator    of rank 1 . 3 . : :    the canonical map from @xmath60 to @xmath42    which is called the trace map , the contraction map , or the evaluation    map is denoted by a repeated index .",
    "the index must appear exactly once    as a superscript and once as a subscript .",
    "used together , contractions    and tensor products subsume most of the usual operations in linear    algebra .",
    "for example , @xmath61 is the value of    @xmath28 at @xmath39 , @xmath62 is the    operator @xmath59 applied to @xmath39 ,    @xmath63 is the trace of @xmath59 , and so on .",
    "although index notation only allows basis - independent computations with tensors , the notation is motivated by computations in a specific basis .",
    "suppose the vector space @xmath41 has dimension @xmath22 and has a given basis .",
    "we may interpret the notation @xmath50 to mean the coordinates of the vector @xmath39 , with @xmath24 an integer from 1 to @xmath22 , and in general we may interpret @xmath47 to be the matrix entries of the tensor @xmath35 . in this case a tensor formula in index notation may be interpreted as a formula for the matrix entries of the tensors , and the two formulas are equivalent given the convention that we sum over any repeated indices ( the einstein summation convention ) .",
    "we may use the summation convention to arrive at a re - interpretation of certain state models .",
    "suppose that @xmath3 is a state model such that every atom is adjacent to precisely two interactions , and suppose for simplicity that there is only one state set @xmath23 .",
    "we may declare @xmath23 to be the index set of a basis ( or perhaps @xmath23 is the basis ) of a vector space @xmath41 .",
    "we declare each atom @xmath24 to be an index letter .",
    "we may then re - interpret the values of each weight function @xmath19 as the matrix entries of a tensor @xmath64 of total type @xmath22 .",
    "we arbitrarily declare each of the indices of each @xmath64 to be covariant or contravariant , provided that each atom is used once as a superscript and once as a subscript . in this case",
    "the partition function @xmath20 is the result of tensoring together all of the interaction tensors and then contracting all of the ( atom ) indices in the natural manner .",
    "thus , we define a _ tensorial state model _ to be a list of tensors over one vector space , together with a formula which is some product of these tensors with all indices contracted .",
    "the partition function is defined to be the value of this formula .",
    "more generally , we say that @xmath3 is a _ tensorial state model with boundary _ if @xmath3 is a formula which is a product of tensors with some subset of the indices contracted .",
    "we call the uncontracted indices the boundary of the model , and the contracted indices the interior .",
    "we define the _ partition tensor _ @xmath65 to be the value of the formula .",
    "the partition tensor @xmath3 should not be confused with the partition function of @xmath3 .",
    "the state models defined in this paper will all be tensorial state models .    to conclude this section",
    ", we present a more visual version of index notation which we will actually use . to avoid using many different letters for contracted indices",
    ", we may draw each tensor with an inward arrow for every subscript and an outward arrow for every superscript .",
    "for example , we write the tensor @xmath66 as follows : @xmath67 we denote the contraction of two indices by connecting the corresponding arrows . for example , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are written as : @xmath70 for consistency , we should interpret the strange - looking expression : @xmath71 as the scalar @xmath72 .",
    "arrows can and will cross . strictly speaking",
    ", the visual notation can be ambiguous .",
    "for example , it is not clear if the following denotes @xmath73 or @xmath74 , or perhaps even @xmath75 : @xmath76 we declare that indices should be read off in counter - clockwise order .",
    "the meaning of a diagram is still ambiguous if the arrows incident to some tensor are symmetric under rotation .",
    "however , all such tensors in this paper will be symmetric under cyclic permutation of their indices , so this ambiguity will be irrelevant to us .",
    "a finite - dimensional _ hopf algebra _ is a finite - dimensional vector space @xmath1 ( over some ground field @xmath42 ) such that @xmath1 and @xmath77 are both algebras with unit , and the two algebra structures satisfy certain compatibility axioms .",
    "we will describe the axioms with the fancy notation of the previous section .",
    "firstly , we may describe the algebra structure on @xmath1 by a _ multiplication tensor _",
    "@xmath3 defined so that @xmath78 is the product of @xmath39 and @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath3 satisfies the associativity axiom : @xmath79 similarly , the algebra structure on @xmath77 is described by the _ comultiplication tensor _ @xmath80 which is coassociative : @xmath81 in addition , there are three other tensors @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath23 called the _ unit _ , the _ counit _ , and the _ antipode _ of @xmath1 .",
    "the five tensors together satisfy these axioms : @xmath84 we also assume as an axiom that @xmath23 has an inverse , although this fact follows from the other axioms in the finite - dimensional case @xcite . given @xmath3 and @xmath80 , the other tensors are unique when they exist , so we may say that @xmath3 and @xmath80 are the `` meat '' of a hopf algebra .",
    "morphism of hopf algebras _ is defined to be a linear transformation of the underlying vector spaces which commutes with the five structure tensors .",
    "since we have not defined infinite - dimensional hopf algebras and will not use them , we will assume that a hopf algebra is finite - dimensional unless explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "we adopt the following abbreviations in light of the associativity and coassociativity axioms : @xmath85 the dual vector @xmath35 is called the _ trace _ , and the vector @xmath86 is the _",
    "cotrace_. we will call the last two tensors the _ tracial product _ and _ tracial coproduct_. like the diagrams , the tensors themselves are cyclically symmetric .",
    "one motivation for the definition of a hopf algebra is the observation that every group algebra is naturally a hopf algebra .",
    "let @xmath0 be a finite group .",
    "we may let the elements of @xmath0 be both a basis and a dual basis for a vector space @xmath87 $ ] , and define multiplication and comultiplication by : @xmath88 the antipode is induced by the group inverse .",
    "this construction has the nice property that the morphisms between the hopf algebras of two groups correspond to the homomorphisms between the groups themselves .",
    "in general , the antipode plays the role of the group inverse in a hopf algebra .",
    "however , the antipode need not satisfy @xmath89 .",
    "a hopf algebra is called involutory if this equation is satisfied .",
    "many important hopf algebras are not involutory , and in particular those used in the analysis of the jones polynomial are non - involutory @xcite .",
    "however , we will only obtain results about involutory hopf algebras in this paper .",
    "finite - dimensional hopf algebras possess an eight - fold duality .",
    "if @xmath1 is a hopf algebra , we obtain a new hopf algebra @xmath90 on the same vector space by reversing multiplication : @xmath91 we will show below that @xmath92 is the antipode of @xmath90 . similarly , we define @xmath93 by reversing comultiplication . finally , we define the _ dual _ of @xmath1 , a hopf algebra structure on the vector space @xmath77 , by switching @xmath3 with @xmath80 and @xmath83 with @xmath82 and reversing all the arrows ( actually , what we are calling @xmath77 is usually defined as @xmath94 , and vice - versa ) : @xmath95    we establish some basic identities involving hopf algebras",

    "if @xmath1 has invertible dimension , we can express all of the structure tensors of a hopf algebra in terms of tracial product and coproduct !",
    "in the section ( and the rest of the paper ) we will work in the smooth category of manifolds .",
    "we will use the term @xmath22-manifold to mean an oriented ( not merely orientable ) and compact @xmath22-manifold which may have boundary and may or may not be connected .",
    "we recall some basic elements of 3-manifold topology as described in @xcite .",
    "heegaard splitting _ is a decomposition of a closed 3-manifold into two handlebodies of the same genus glued along their boundary ; the boundary is called a _",
    "heegaard surface_. given such a decomposition , we may arbitrarily label the two handlebodies upper and lower .",
    "if the handlebodies are labeled , then an orientation of the heegaard surface induces an orientation of the manifold : at a point @xmath120 , we complete a positively - oriented basis @xmath121 of the tangent space of @xmath23 at @xmath120 to a ( positive ) basis @xmath122 of @xmath123 by choosing @xmath124 to point from the upper handlebody to the lower one .",
    "if @xmath23 is a surface , we define a _ handlebody diagram _",
    "@xmath27 on @xmath23 to be a prescription for gluing a handlebody to @xmath23 .",
    "specifically , it is a family of disjoint circles @xmath125 which divides @xmath23 into planar regions .",
    "( often it is assumed that @xmath125 does not separate @xmath23 , but we do not want this hypothesis . ) we obtain a handlebody @xmath126 from @xmath27 by the following procedure : we start with @xmath127 and glue a 2-handle along a tubular neighborhood of each circle @xmath128 .",
    "the boundary of the result is @xmath129 plus a number of spheres .",
    "we eliminate the spherical boundary components by gluing in balls to obtain @xmath126 .",
    "we say that @xmath130 is a _ heegaard diagram _ of a closed 3-manifold on a surface @xmath23 is a prescription for a heegaard splitting of a manifold @xmath131 , i.e. it is a pair of handlebody diagrams @xmath132 and @xmath133 which describe the upper and the lower handlebodies of the splitting .",
    "we assume that @xmath132 and @xmath133 are transverse .",
    "we will need to generalize the definition of a heegaard diagram to account for manifolds with boundary , and to relax the constraint that the circles of a handlebody diagram divide the surface of the diagram into planar regions . to this end",
    ", we also label the boundary of a 3-manifold @xmath3 by arbitrarily dividing the boundary components of @xmath3 into two disjoint subsets : the upper boundary and the lower boundary .",
    "we also define a _ puncture move _ on a 3-manifold @xmath3 with labeled boundary to consist of removing a ball from @xmath3 and labeling the new boundary as upper or lower .",
    "we define a _",
    "bordism _ to be an equivalence class of 3-manifolds with labeled boundary under the puncture move . by abuse of terminology",
    ", we will not distinguish between a bordism and a representative of a bordism .    a _ compression body _",
    "is a manifold which is obtained from @xmath127 by gluing 2-handles on one side , where @xmath23 is a surface ( usually one requires that all spherical boundary components of a compression body are capped by balls , but in the context of bordisms this does not matter ) .",
    "a compression diagram is then a generalization of a handlebody diagram : it is a prescription for gluing a compression body to a surface @xmath23 consisting of a collection of disjoint circles .",
    "however , the circles are not required to divide the surface into planar regions .",
    "we define a generalized heegaard diagram to be a pair of compression diagrams ( an upper diagram and a lower diagram ) on one surface .",
    "if we are given a generalized heegaard diagram @xmath130 on @xmath23 , we may form a bordism @xmath3 by gluing together the corresponding compression bodies along @xmath23 .",
    "the boundary of the lower compression body becomes the lower boundary of the bordism , and the same for the upper compression body .",
    "we will need a set of moves to convert any heegaard diagram of a bordism to any other diagram for the same bordism .",
    "also , it may not be obvious that every bordism has a heegaard diagram .",
    "we may solve both of these problems using the theory of morse functions , as described in @xcite .",
    "we summarize the relevant parts of the theory : if @xmath3 is a bordism , we first choose a riemannian metric for @xmath3 .",
    "we choose a morse function @xmath134 on @xmath3 which attains its minimum on the lower boundary of @xmath3 and its maximum on the upper boundary of @xmath3 . using the riemannian metric",
    ", we can consider the flow @xmath135 on @xmath3 given by the gradient of @xmath134 .",
    "for each fixed point @xmath120 of @xmath135 , we consider the descending manifold of @xmath120 , the set of all points that flow into @xmath120 .",
    "the descending manifold is necessarily a disk of some dimension , and in this way we obtain a handle decomposition of @xmath3 . if @xmath134 is in general position , each @xmath22-handles is attached only to @xmath136-handles with @xmath137 ( not merely @xmath138 ) and possibly to the lower boundary . finally , it is easy to convert such a handle decomposition to a generalized heegaard diagram : we let the lower compression body be the union of the 0-handles , the 1-handles , and a tubular neighborhood of the lower boundary , and we let the upper compression body be the complement of the lower compression body .",
    "we obtain an upper circle for each 2-handle by intersecting the core ( descending manifold ) of the 2-handle with the heegaard surface , and similarly we intersect the cocore ( ascending manifold ) of each 1-handle with the heegaard surface to obtain the lower circles .",
    "since every bordism has a morse function , every bordism has a heegaard diagram . on the other hand ,",
    "given a heegaard diagram , it is easy to construct a morse function which reproduces it .",
    "we can therefore obtain a set of moves on heegaard diagrams from a set of moves on morse functions .",

    "we call this move @xmath248 . the circle",
    "@xmath86 bounds a disk @xmath269 in the 2-handle which is attached to @xmath268 in the move @xmath248 , and @xmath86 bounds a disk @xmath259 in the 2-handle attached in the move @xmath244 .",
    "we see that the move @xmath248 followed by compressing the disk @xmath270 yields the same result as the move @xmath244 followed by compressing the disk @xmath271 . as",
    "before , if we move @xmath268 away from the annulus @xmath12 , it intersects @xmath251 less than @xmath250 does .",

    "any maximal path of destruction removes this component entirely .",
    "thus , @xmath250 and @xmath251 are rendered equivalent by the annulus moves represented by @xmath272 .",
    "although @xmath220 is a complete formal invariant for closed 3-manifolds , it is not necessarily a complete invariant in the computational sense , because it may be as difficult to distinguish elements of @xmath274 as it is to distinguish 3-manifolds by the standard means .    the heegaard category @xmath274 is residually representable .",

    "the construction given in this paper is almost certainly not as general as it could be .",
    "for example , dijkgraaf @xcite mentions the following state model on triangulations which was described to me by vaughan jones : as before , we choose a finite group @xmath0 to be the state set , we assign states to the oriented edges of a triangulation , and we assign an interaction to each face which is 0 unless the product of the states of the face s edges is the identity .",
    "however , we also have an interaction for each tetrahedron , which we assume is non - zero whenever the value of the tetrahedron s faces is non - zero .",
    "we may view this interaction as a complex - valued function @xmath288 , with @xmath289 , and therefore as a cochain on the canonical triangulation of @xmath290 with coefficients in the multiplicative group @xmath291 .",
    "the constraint that the state model is a topological invariant is equivalent to the condition that this cochain is actually a cocycle , and two different cocycles yield the same invariant if they are cohomologous .",
