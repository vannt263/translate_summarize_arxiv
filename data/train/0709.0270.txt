    "studies of the spectra of accreting black holes are important for understanding the accretion flow and geometry , and hence the effects of strong gravity and black - hole spin . in a black - hole binary ( bhb ) system , radiatively efficient accretion through a disc generates a quasi - thermal spectrum which is well seen in the high / soft states ( see remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) .",
    "modeling of such spectra , with detailed attention paid to spectral hardening by radiation - transfer effects , has been undertaken by shimura & takahara 1995 , merloni , fabian & ross 2000 , and recently by davis and collaborators ( davis et al .",
    "2005 ; davis & hubeny 2006 ) . at the same time , coronal emission in such sources generates a power - law spectrum by inverse compton scattering of the thermal disc photons .",
    "this hard emission can irradiate the disc to produce a reflection spectrum ( guilbert & rees 1988 ; lightman & white 1988 ; george & fabian 1991 ; ross & fabian 1993 ) which may contain sharp spectral features that can reveal the velocity of the matter and the depth of the gravitational well ( fabian et al .",
    "2000 ; reynolds & nowak 2003 ; miller 2007 ) .    here",
    "we investigate reflection spectra in bhbs .",
    "broad iron emission lines have been found in a wide range of bhbs ( bauciska - church & church 2000 ; martocchia et al .",
    "2002 ; miller et al .",

    "low-@xmath2 elements are stripped of electrons even before photoionization by illuminating radiation is considered , and thermal emission by the gas can dominate portions of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "we begin by considering reflection by an accretion - disc surface layer which has a density structure consistent with the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "we then show a range of spectra produced by constant - density slabs heated from below by blackbody radiation and illuminated from above by hard power - law radiation .",
    "we begin with a model for illumination of gas in hydrostatic equilibrium atop a spatially thin accretion disc .",
    "we take the mass of the central black hole to be @xmath3 and the accretion rate to be a fraction @xmath4 of the value corresponding to the eddington limit .",
    "if all gravitational energy is dissipated within the disc , the total flux emerging from the disc at radius @xmath5 ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) is expected to be @xmath6 for a nonrotating black hole , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the gravitational radius .",
    "we model the radiative transfer and hydrostatic equilibrium throughout a surface layer of total thomson depth @xmath9 .",
    "the base of this surface layer is fixed at height @xmath10 above the midplane of the disc , where @xmath10 is the estimate for the half - thickness of the accretion disc given by merloni et al .",
    "the total flux @xmath11 enters the surface layer from below in the form of a blackbody spectrum .",
    "the method for treating the radiative transfer and finding the self - consistent temperature and ionization state of the gas has been described by ross & fabian ( 2005 ) and references therein .",
    "the steady - state radiation field is assumed to satisfy the fokker - planck / diffusion equation , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the photon occupation number , @xmath14 is the photon energy , @xmath15 is the vertical height above the midplane of the accretion disc , @xmath16 is the spectral emissivity , @xmath17 is the total opacity ( per volume ) , @xmath18 is the absorption opacity , and @xmath19 is the klein - nishina opacity for compton scattering .",
    "the leading term , @xmath20 , is given by the fokker - planck equation of cooper ( 1971 ) and accurately treats the effects of compton scattering for @xmath21 and @xmath22 . as the radiation field is relaxed to a steady state , the local temperature and fractional ionization of the gas are found by solving the equations of thermal and ionization equilibrium .",
    "in addition to fully - ionized species , the following ions are included in the calculations : ciii  vi , niii ",
    "vii , oiii ",
    "viii , neiii  x , mgiii ",
    "xii , siiv ",
    "xiv , siv ",
    "xvi , and fevi  xxvi .",
    "elemental abundances are taken from morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) .",
    "ross & fabian ( 2005 ) have summarized the atomic data employed . in particular , it should be noted that three - body recombination , which can be important for elements lighter than iron at the high densities in our models , is included in the recombination rate tables of summers ( 1974 ) that are employed .",
    "three - body recombination of iron is neglected , since it is only important at higher densities ( @xmath23 ) than occur in our models ( jacobs et al .",
    "1977 ) .",
    "the density structure of the gas within the surface layer is found from the condition for hydrostatic equilibrium : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the gas pressure , @xmath26 is the gas density , and @xmath27 is the total radiation energy density .",
    "details of the method have been described by ballantyne et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "we consider an illuminated accretion - disc surface located at @xmath28 when the accretion rate corresponds to @xmath29 times the eddington limit .",
    "the blackbody radiation emerging from the disc then corresponds to a temperature such that @xmath30 .",
    "the outer surface is illuminated by a cutoff power - law spectrum with photon index @xmath31 and @xmath32-folding energy @xmath33 for the high - energy exponential cutoff . for self - consistent results ,",
    "photon energies ranging from 1  ev to 1  mev are treated in the radiative transfer calculation .",
    "however , the illuminating spectrum , which is probably produced by compton upscattering of disc radiation by a hot accretion - disc corona ( e.g. , shapiro , lightman & eardley 1976 ; haardt & maraschi 1993 ; dove , wilms & begelman 1997 ) , can not be expected to extend to extremely low energies .",
    "therefore , the illuminating spectrum is given an abrupt low - energy cutoff at @xmath34 .",
    "the illumination has a total flux @xmath35 , so that the thermal radiation dominates .",
    "( in the 220  kev range , the illuminating flux is 0.17 times the disc flux . )",
    "is illuminated by a cutoff power - law spectrum with total flux @xmath35 . ]    the calculated temperature and density structures of the surface layer are shown in figure  1 .",
    "the thermal radiation from the disc below keeps the temperature high throughout the surface layer , and the external radiation causes the temperature to rise with decreasing thomson depth for @xmath36 .",
    "elements lighter than iron are fully ionized throughout the surface layer .",
    "the disc radiation is too soft to ionize iron k - shell electrons , however , and fexxv dominates for @xmath37 .",
    "the gas density decreases steadily as @xmath38 decreases .",
    "there is no abrupt change in temperature and density like that found when a cooler agn accretion disc is illuminated ( nayakshin , kazanas & kallman 2000 ; ballantyne et al .",
    "2001 ; raska et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the spectrum emerging from the surface of the disc is shown in figure  2 .",
    "the hotter gas near the illuminated surface causes the 210  kev `` thermal '' spectrum to be enhanced both by compton upscattering and by additional bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "the spectrum above 6  kev exhibits compton - broadened k@xmath0 emission and k - absorption features due to fexxv .",
    "the characteristic `` reflection hump '' produced by compton downscattering of high - energy photons is apparent at @xmath39 .",
    "in reality , the detailed geometry and boundary conditions of the illuminated disc surface are poorly known .",
    "therefore , it makes little sense to pursue hydrostatic - equilibrium models like the one presented in  2 any further . to study a range of reflection spectra that are possible",
    ", we simplify the situation by considering reflection by a constant - density atmosphere ( see ross & fabian 2005 ) .",
    "indeed , ballantyne et al .  ( 2001 ) found that even under agn conditions , models for reflection by atmospheres in hydrostatic equilibrium could be fitted by diluted ( smaller reflection fraction ) versions of constant - density reflection models .",
    "the atmosphere of the accretion disc is approximated by a slab with fixed hydrogen density @xmath40 and thomson depth @xmath9 .",
    "the thermal emission from the disc is represented by a blackbody spectrum with designated temperature @xmath41 entering the slab from below .",
    "the outer surface is illuminated by a cutoff power - law spectrum with designated photon index @xmath42 and @xmath43 ratio .",
    "the @xmath32-folding energy for the high - energy cutoff to the illumination is fixed at @xmath33 , and the illumination again has a abrupt low - energy cutoff at @xmath34 .    , while the illumination ( dotted ) has @xmath44 and @xmath45 . for comparison ,",
    "the lighter solid curve shows the spectrum from fig .  2 .",
    "]    figure  3 shows the emerging spectrum for a constant - density model with the same parameters as the hydrostatic - atmosphere model discussed previously , namely @xmath46 , @xmath44 , and @xmath47 .",
    "the constant density chosen corresponds to the density for @xmath48 in the hydrostatic - atmosphere model , and the temperature in the constant - density model agrees well for @xmath48 .",
    "since the density is higher for @xmath36 , the effective ionization parameter is lower , and the gas is somewhat cooler and less highly ionized in the constant - density model . as a result ,",
    "the fe k@xmath0 line is slightly stronger , the iron k - edge is somewhat deeper , and at lower energies , tiny emission features are produced by recombinations to hydrogen - like ions of the lighter elements .",
    "overall , however , the emergent spectrum is seen to be in reasonably good agreement with the result for an atmosphere in hydrostatic equilibrium .",

    "of course , the thermal radiation becomes less dominant as the @xmath43 ratio increases .",
    "for the four lowest values of @xmath43 shown in fig .  4 , the illumination is so weak that the thermal radiation determines the ionization structure , with fexxv dominating throughout the atmosphere . for @xmath49",
    ", however , the illumination has an ionization parameter @xmath50 ergcms@xmath51 , where @xmath52 this makes fexxvi the dominant species near the illuminated surface ( @xmath53 ) , and fexxvi contributes significantly to the broad iron k@xmath0 line . for @xmath54 ,",
    "iron is fully ionized for @xmath53 , and fexxvi dominates for @xmath55 .",

    "the main effect is on the high - energy tail above @xmath58 , where compton downscattered illumination dominates the spectrum . for the steepest illuminating spectrum ( @xmath59 ) , the 610 kev portion of the emergent spectrum is also lowered .",

    "xiv , sxv , and fexxi  xxiii dominate for @xmath36 .",
    "there is a steep dropoff in the emergent spectrum due to iron l - shell absorption , and k@xmath0 lines of sixiii  xiv and sxv  xvi are visible .",
    "the iron k@xmath0 line is weak due to the destruction of these photons via the auger effect during resonant trapping ( see ross , fabian & brandt 1996 ) . for @xmath61 , sxvi and fexxv dominate near the illuminated surface , and the emergent spectrum exhibits a strong fexxv k@xmath0 line . as @xmath62 increases beyond 0.35  kev",
    ", fexxv remains the dominant species in the atmosphere , but the iron k@xmath0 line becomes weaker and more difficult to distinguish from the strengthening thermal continuum .",
    "in the high / soft state of a bhb , the x - ray spectrum is dominated by the soft thermal radiation , which generally accounts for @xmath63 of the flux in the 220  kev range .",
    "additional spectral components are generally a high - energy tail , which is approximately a power law with photon index @xmath64 , and a broad iron k@xmath0 emission feature ( see tanaka & lewin 1995 ; reynolds & nowak 2003 ; mcclintock & remillard 2006 ; remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) .",
    "we have demonstrated how illumination of a bhb accretion disc can help produce such features .    , and",
    "the disc below is cold .",
    "emergent spectra are shown for @xmath44 illumination with the same ionization parameters as in fig .  4 , namely @xmath65 ( bottom solid curve ) , 97.0  ( dotted ) , 194  ( solid ) , 388  ( dotted ) , 970  ( solid ) , 1940  ( dotted ) , and 3880 ergcms@xmath51 ( top solid curve ) . ]    the emergent spectra under black - hole binary conditions are quite different than under the conditions in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "for comparison , fig .",
    "7 shows the corresponding reflection spectra under conditions that would be expected in an active galactic nucleus .",
    "the density in the accretion - disc atmosphere and the total illuminating flux are lower , and thermal radiation from the cooler disc , which lies well below x - ray energies , is ignored .",
    "the models calculated have the same values for the illumination ionization parameter , @xmath66 , as those shown in fig .  4 . with lower temperatures and little ionizing radiation within the disc",
    ", the metals are not highly ionized . for @xmath67 and 97.0 ergcms@xmath51 ,",
    "the atmosphere is only highly ionized in a very thin surface layer . now",
    "the iron k@xmath0 emission is dominated by the 6.4-kev fluorescence of weakly ionized atoms .",
    "strong emission features at lower energies are due to k - lines of the lighter elements as well as l - lines of iron , while the continuum there is suppressed by bound - free absorption . for @xmath68 ergcms@xmath51 ,",
    "the iron k@xmath0 line is weak due to resonant auger destruction . for @xmath69 and 970 ergcms@xmath51 ,",
    "the fe  xxv k@xmath0 line at 6.7  kev dominates , but strong emission lines are still present at lower energies . for @xmath70 and 3880 ergcms@xmath51 ,",
    "the gas is highly ionized within a deep surface layer , and the reflected spectrum is fairly similar to the bhb case , except that the lack of soft thermal radiation makes the spectrum flatter for @xmath71 .",

    "in particular , reflection in a bhb system can not be mimicked simply by adding a blackbody spectrum to the reflection spectrum from an otherwise cool disc .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure 8 , which shows two examples of adjusting a local agn reflection spectrum upward by a factor of @xmath72 and then adding a blackbody spectrum to represent the emission by the disc . for @xmath73 ergcms@xmath51 ,",
    "the mimicked spectrum has a narrow iron line at 6.4  kev , while the actual bhb spectrum has a strong , compton - broadened fexxv line ( 6.7 kev ) atop a much higher continuum . for @xmath74 ergcms@xmath51 ,",
    "on the other hand , the mimicked spectrum does have a broad fexxv line , but the actual bhb spectrum has a very different line shape due to a blend of fexxv and fexxvi emission , and the surrounding continuum is again higher .    if the accreting object was a neutron star ( @xmath75 ) instead of a 10-@xmath76 black hole , then both @xmath11 and",
    "@xmath77 would be @xmath78 times larger for the same values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "although the `` ionization parameter '' of the disc radiation would be the same , its harder spectrum ( @xmath62 about 1.6 times larger ) would give it greater ionizing power .",
    ", @xmath44 , and @xmath47 ( dotted curve ) has been blurred ( solid curve ) as if observed from a region with emissivity index 3 extending from 6 to 20 gravitational radii in a disc around a rotating black hole , and viewed at an inclination angle of @xmath81 . ]    of course , spectral features due to reflection by the inner portion of the accretion disc will be blurred by the relativistic doppler effect and gravitational redshift .",
    "figure  9 shows an example of such relativistic blurring for the model with @xmath46 , @xmath44 , and @xmath47 discussed in  3 .",
    "the fe  xxv k@xmath0 line , already broadened by compton scattering , is further broadened and redshifted .",
    "the iron k - edge in the reflected spectrum is also smeared out , making it less prominent ( see ross et al .",
    "1996 ) . in this way it mimics the smedge model in xspec",
    "often used for fitting the spectra of bhb .",
    "this model is a simple phenomenological representation of a smeared absorption edge ( ebisawa et al .",
    "1994 ) , and has no clear physical basis .",
    "compton broadening of the iron k@xmath0 line is relatively more important for bhb at a given @xmath66 value than for agn since the surface layers are hotter .",
    "this is important when deducing the spin of the black hole from the overall observed breadth of the line .",
