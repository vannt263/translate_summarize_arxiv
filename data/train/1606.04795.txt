    "the advanced ligo experiment detected the first transient gravitational wave signal ( gw150914 ) from the inspiral and merger of a pair of black holes of masses 36  and 29 @xcite .",
    "this was remarkable not only for being the first direct detection of gravitational waves but the first evidence that binary black holes ( bbh ) exist , and the largest mass estimates for black holes in the stellar regime @xcite .",
    "this has been followed by a second discovery , also of a bbh merger signal , with a pair of bhs with masses @xmath5 and @xmath6@xcite on 2015 december 26 ( gw151226 ) .",
    "ligo estimate a luminosity distance of @xmath7mpc corresponding to a redshift @xmath8 ( 90% limits ) . ]    a broad range of teams have begun efforts to follow - up gw signals to detect the putative electromagnetic ( em ) counterparts .",
    "the first event resulted in 25 teams of observers covering the ligo sky localization region with gamma ray to radio facilities ( summarised in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the general assumption has been that bbh mergers will not produce a detectable em signature .",
    "however fermi may have detected a weak x - ray transient which was temporally coincident with gw150914 @xcite , although the reality of the detection is disputed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested a novel mechanism that may produce both a bbh merger and a relativistic jet from the fragmentation of a rapidly rotating core of a single massive star .",
    "however if the fermi hard x - ray detection is real , it is more like a short gamma - ray burst than a long one .",
    "furthermore @xcite investigated this scenario quantitatively and finds a single star origin to be unlikely .",
    "@xcite proposed a short grb may be formed if the two black holes are formed within a fossil disk which restarts accretion due to tidal forces and shocks during the bbh merger .",
    "hence the searches continue , particularly as a detection would open up a major new way to probe high energy astrophysics , stellar evolution , compact remnants and test modified theories of gravity @xcite .    here",
    "we present the results of our wide - field search for an optical counterpart to the transient gravitational wave event gw151226 using the pan - starrs1 ( ps1 ) and the atlas survey telescopes combined with spectroscopic follow - up from hawaiian facilities and the public eso spectroscopic survey of transient objects ( pessto ) .",
    "to search for optical counterparts to gravitational wave events our collaboration @xcite uses the pan - starrs1 system @xcite for imaging and relies on the existence of the pan - starrs1 3@xmath9 survey ( chambers et .",
    "2016 in prep ) for template images .",
    "the pessto survey together with programs on gemini north with gmos , the uh2.2 m with snifs , provide spectroscopic classification .",
    "the data for one object discovered here were supplemented with hubble space telescope observations .",
    "gw151226 was detected on 2015 december 26 03:39 utc ( mjd 57382.152 ) and released to the em community as a discovery on 2015 december 27 17:40 utc @xcite .",
    "the initial localization generated by the bayestar pipeline @xcite contained a 50% credible region of 430 square degrees and a 90% region of about 1400 square degrees ( to be compared with 90% credible region of 630 square degrees for gw150914 * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we began taking data with the pan - starrs1 telescope during the next available dark hours , on 2015 dec 28 05:08 utc ( 11.47hr after the ligo information release and 49.48hr after the event time ) and mapped out a region of 214 square degrees on this first night as shown in figure[fig : skymap ] .",
    "the same region was mapped on the two subsequent nights ( extending to 273 square degrees ) .",
    "all observations were done with the pan - starrs1 @xmath0  filter with a 4-point dither pattern at each pointing centre .",
    "the four individual ( back to back ) 45 sec exposures were co - added to produce a 180s exposure and the pan - starrs1 3@xmath9 @xmath0reference image ( typically having an effective total exposure time of 270 - 900 sec ) was subtracted from this 180s night stack ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and magnier et al . in prep , for more details ) .",
    "on any one night this 180s exposure sequence was repeated multiple times ( 2 - 3 ) in the central highest probability region , giving us some intra - night sampling .",
    "the sequence was repeated a further 5 times between 2016 january 02 and january 25 ( extending the full footprint to a total of 290 square degrees ) . the observing cadence and sensitivity",
    "are illustrated in figure[fig : skymap ] , and the full ps1 footprint corresponds to 26.5% of the full ligo posterior probability .",
    "this footprint choice was a combination of telescope accessibility of the ligo localization map and a choice to go deeper on the higher probability regions @xcite .",
    "we selected targets with similar filtering algorithms as described in our first paper @xcite .",
    "a total of 2.3@xmath10 detections were ingested into the database ( after basic rejections of known defects ) .",
    "spatial aggregation of detections within 05 of each other resulted in the creation of 1.1@xmath10 objects and basic filtering and insistence of two separate detections resulted in a total of 1.7@xmath11 candidate astrophysical transients .",
    "subsequent filtering ( obvious dipoles , stellar objects and objects near bright stars ) and a random forest machine learning classifier reduced the numbers to 144,000 for which the pixel recognition machine learning technique was employed @xcite .",
    "further removal of 3,903 known minor planets left a total of 24,100 objects for humans to scan and this manual process resulted in 85 objects for further investigation .",
    "the human scanning involved removing artefacts that are obvious to the eye but are not properly recognised by the machine learning .",
    "as we wanted to err on the side of completion over purity , we set the machine learning threshold to roughly a 20 per cent false positive rate on the roc curve ( see fig.7 of * ? ? ?",
    "* for an illustration ) .",
    "the human scanning removed subtraction and chip defects that are easily distinguished visually .",
    "we note that in the milky way plane there were at least a further 43 faint transients which are very likely variable stars that reach above our detection limit on a few epochs .",
    "a few could be background hostless supernovae , but their location in the plane suggests they are faint stellar variables .",
    "in addition , the atlas 0.5 m telescope @xcite , covered a significant fraction of the northern sky in the first five days after gw151226 as shown in figure[fig : skymap ] .",
    "these data were taken during normal atlas operations and can be thought of as atlas working in serendipitous mode . in future , atlas will be able to work in targeted mode in the same way as pan - starrs1 .",
    "a single atlas unit , with its 30 square degree cameras can map out 1000 square degrees within 30 minutes .",
    "we highlight that just 3hrs after the gw151226 event detection , atlas serendipitously covered 87 square degrees of the sky localization region ( 2.2% enclosed probability ) during the time window @xmath12 .",
    "we processed all atlas data taken serendipitously in the first 5 days to locate transients as in @xcite . after processing about 575 sq .",
    "degrees , the atlas coverage increases the total enclosed probability to 36% over the first 5 days from gw151226 , getting to median 5@xmath13 limits of @xmath14 ( orange filter ) .",
    "apart from variable stars and cv candidates , we found no other extragalactic transient candidates in this stream .",
    "filters only ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) and a full bolometric lightcurve estimated from a black body extrapolation between @xmath15 m . a simple arnett model , as described in @xcite is shown for the latter with input parameters : @xmath16ergs , @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "this simply indicates that a @xmath19ni model is a poor fit and that type ibn are not well explained by radioactive powering .",
    "* lower : * comparison with two well observed sn ibn @xcite . ]      during our filtering , we removed obvious galactic stellar variables and known agn candidates . after removing these contaminants",
    ", we found 49 transients which are either confirmed sne or likely sne which are all summarised in table[tab : trans ] .",
    "as discussed in @xcite the detected transients are dominated by mostly old supernovae that exploded over an extended period before the gw trigger .",
    "the sky position of transients found in the first three days are plotted in figure[fig : skymap ] .",
    "those with spectroscopic classifications are listed along with their redshifts .",
    "we suggest that all these objects are unrelated field supernovae , although one object , ps15dpn deserves closer inspection and is discussed in the next section .",
    "we note two objects that are unrelated to gw151226 but are worth highlighting in the context of searching for unusual transients in ligo / virgo sky localization regions .",
    "ps15dqa is a faint transient in the nearby ( @xmath20mpc ) galaxy ngc 1156 .",
    "the transient magnitude @xmath0=20.8 implies @xmath21 ( including significant milky way foreground extinction of @xmath22 ) . a hubble space telescope ( hst ) archive image with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs , in filter f625w ) of ngc  1156 shows an object which is astrometrically coincident with ps15dqa to within 03 .",
    "this is a stellar point source with @xmath23 and hence @xmath24 . assuming a bolometric correction of zero this corresponds to @xmath25dex which implies a 50 - 60  star that is undergoing brightness variations by a factor of 2 .",
    "while this scale of variability is known for massive stars of this luminosity , and is unrelated to gw151226 , it illustrates our ability to identify faint transients in nearby galaxies . secondly , ps16li is a fast optical transient with a 1.3 magnitude fade in 13min on the night of mjd=57397.51 with a faint , red point source in the ps1 reference stack",
    "this is an m - dwarf flare ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which highlights our ability to pick up fast decaying transients .",
    "images from ps1 on mjd=57386 showing ps15dpn offset from its host galaxy .",
    "color composite ( f475w , f814w , f160w ) image from hst on mjd=57447 . ]",
    "this object was reported early in the campaign as being of interest because of its rising light curve and very blue spectrum @xcite .",
    "we gathered a multi - color ps1 lightcurve in @xmath26   @xcite and one epoch of hst imaging with wfc3 ( see figures[fig:15dpn - lc ] and [ fig:15dpn - hst ] ) , together with 8 epochs of spectra .",
    "the redshift of the host galaxy is measured at @xmath3 ( @xmath27mpc ) from the centroids of the strong host galaxy emission lines of h@xmath28 , [ nii ] and [ sii ] .",
    "figure[fig:15dpn - spec ] shows the evolution of this transient into a type ibn supernova .",
    "these sne are likely the explosion of wolf - rayet stars which are embedded in a he - rich circumstellar medium lost by the progenitor system @xcite .",
    "the gmos spectrum at + 26 days post - peak is typical of this class with hei emission lines .",
    "the hei @xmath295876  line has fwhm@xmath30 .    to estimate the explosion epoch",
    ", we used a third order polynomial fit to the first six ps1 @xmath0-band detections to estimate a date of @xmath31 .",
    "this is @xmath32d before the detection of gw151226 .",
    "the uncertainty is estimated from usage of different fits ( order 2 - 4 ) and epochs ( 4 to 8) . using the first 6 epochs and a 4th order fit gives an explosion epoch of 57382.03 , exactly coincident with gw151226 .",
    "there is one type ibn which has a double peaked lightcurve @xcite and if that were common then this method would not be accurate .",
    "we calculated the bolometric lightcurve after applying suitable @xmath33corrections @xcite . a comparison with the only ibn with an early discovery and well measured rise ( sn  2010al ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , shows that the two have very different lightcurve shapes , and therefore sn  2010al is not a good template to use for dating the explosion .",
    "this lightcurve diversity is a feature of ibn , likely indicating the diverse masses of the csm and ejecta that power these transients @xcite .",
    "this illustrates that ps15dpn was temporally coincident with gw151226 to within 2.45 days .",
    "another unusual feature of ps15dpn is the detection in the radio by the vla by @xcite , which is quite a luminous 6ghz detection , similar to the relativistic sn  2009bb @xcite .",
    "therefore ps15dpn caught our attention because of its rarity , and also the fact that the remarkable pre - explosion outburst found for the nearest ibn ( sn2006jc * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is still quantitatively unexplained .    given the temporal coincidence of ps15dpn with gw151226 , we estimate the probability of finding a sn ibn randomly in our sampled field .",
    "while we detected ps15dpn at @xmath34 , we would be sensitive to such an object with @xmath35 ( restframe absolute magnitude ) to @xmath36 . following the calculations in our first paper ( section 6.3 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the cosmic rate of core - collapse sne within @xmath36 implies that within 100 square degrees , there should be 3.1 ccsn explosions per day .",
    "we assume an uncertainty in the explosion epoch estimate of ps15dpn of @xmath37 days and a relative rate of ibn sne of @xmath38 ( which is the fraction of core - collapse sne that are ibn ) .",
    "then the number of ibn sne within a survey area of @xmath39 square degrees is expected to be    @xmath40    for @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , this suggests @xmath44 .",
    "hence the probability of a false positive ( 1 or more events ) when the expectation value is 0.18 is simply the poissonian value @xmath45 . in other words",
    "the probability of finding an unrelated sn ibn exploding within 2 days of gw151226 which is unrelated and a chance coincidence is @xmath46 .",
    "this is not convincingly low enough to imply a causal link , but is low enough to highlight that future coincidences should be searched for .",
    "one could argue that the appropriate value to use for @xmath38 is significantly less than 0.01 , since radio detections at this luminosity for any ibc sn are quite rare @xcite .",
    "alternatively , type ibc sne are much more common overall , which would increase the value for @xmath38 significantly .",
    "one could speculate that a sn ibn could potentially be related to a gw source if it was a compact wolf - rayet star + bh binary , such as the wr+bh systems in the nearby galaxies ic10 and ngc300 @xcite . the wr star would need to undergo core - collapse supernova , followed by gravitational - wave driven merger with the bh companion within @xmath47 days .",
    "however , assuming that the star was not in contact with the black hole prior to the supernova , the merger would typically require thousands of years rather than days .",
    "a very favourable supernova kick toward the bh could reduce the merger timescale , but would require an implausibly high kick velocity and/or a very low - probability kick direction .",
    "however the strongest argument against a link is that the distance estimate to gw151226 is inconsistent with the redshift of ps15dpn @xcite the final probability density function from ligo drops to zero at @xmath34 ( @xmath27mpc ) as shown in the detailed companion analysis paper @xcite .",
    "while the mechanism of @xcite might predict a rapidly rotating massive star which could conceivably produce both a sn ibn and gw emission this now seems unlikely from the calculations of @xcite .",
    "some luminous supernovae have been explained by magnetic neutron stars born with millisecond periods @xcite , and such an object would radiate gravitational waves if it were elliptically deformed .",
    "however a neutron star origin is excluded as the ligo analysis is not consistent with component masses less than 4.5(99% credible level ; * ? ? ?",
    "assuming that none of the transients we found , including ps15dpn , are associated with gw151226 it is useful to set quantitative and meaningful upper limits on potential optical counterparts for bh - bh mergers .",
    "these also serve as a guide to our sensitivity to potential future binary neutron star ( ns - ns ) and neutron star ",
    "black hole ( ns - bh ) merging systems that are more promising systems for producing electromagnetic counterparts particularly redwards of 7000 .    in figure1",
    "we show the 5@xmath13 limits of every ps1 image taken during this campaign .",
    "as described in @xcite , the 5@xmath13 limits are calculated for each of the 51 skycells per pointing of the gpc1 camera data products and the median per night is also plotted .",
    "we also plot parametrised lightcurves of three analytic lightcurves with timescales @xmath48d ( as defined in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these indicate detection limits of @xmath0=20.3 , 20.8 and 20.8 respectively , or @xmath49 at the luminosity distance of gw151226 .    looking to the future , we plot model lightcurves of kilonovae from compact binary mergers ( ns - ns ) of @xcite and @xcite as illustrative examples of our survey capability ( the merger models of * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* are also of similar luminosity ) . at the estimated distance of gw151226 of @xmath50mpc",
    ", the predicted fluxes would be very faint ( below @xmath0@xmath51 ) .",
    "it is expected that ns - ns mergers will be more common by volume and ligo s horizon distance for ns - ns detections is a factor of @xmath525 - 10 smaller than for bh - bh mergers , depending on the bh masses @xcite . during",
    "the next science run beginning in the fall of 2016 , ligo is expected to be sensitive to ns - ns mergers within @xmath53mpc @xcite and we show in figure[fig : skymap ] that our survey strategy would be sensitive to these . ideally , our goal would be to get 0.5 mag deeper , beginning within 24hrs of the gw alert .",
    "we further show the @xmath54band lightcurve of sn  1998bw @xcite which is the typical energetic type ic sn associated with long duration gamma - ray bursts ( lgrbs ) .",
    "figure1 shows that if an energetic type ic sn accompanies such a grb event then it would be an unambiguous , bright transient in our survey .",
    "we do not find such an object , but caution that we surveyed a maximum of 26.5% of the total ligo probability region .",
    "our results are encouraging for future searches for the counterparts of ns - ns mergers within about 100mpc where the predicted optical and near infra - red counterparts are within reach .",

    "<S> we supplemented this with atlas survey data , reaching 31% of the probabilty region to shallower depths of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we found 49 extragalactic transients ( that are not obviously agn ) , including a faint transient in a galaxy at 7mpc ( a luminous blue variable outburst ) plus a rapidly decaying m - dwarf flare . </S>",
    "<S> spectral classification of 20 other transient events showed them all to be supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> we found an unusual transient , ps15dpn , with an explosion date temporally coincident with gw151226 which evolved into a type ibn supernova . </S>",
    "<S> the redshift of the transient is secure at @xmath3 and we find it unlikely to be linked , since the luminosity distance has a negligible probability of being consistent with that of gw151226 . in the 290 square degrees </S>",
