    "star formation occurs in the coldest phase of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , where the gas forms extended structures known as giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) .",
    "however , the internal mechanisms within the clouds that produce a galaxy s star formation rate remain poorly understood . the clouds themselves can not be freely collapsing to form stars , since the rate of gas conversion over a cloud s free - fall time would lead to a star formation rate more than a hundred times higher than observed in the milky way @xcite .",
    "two main options exist for avoiding this conundrum .",
    "the first is that the clouds are destroyed by its first generation of stars , redistributing the majority of its gas back into the warm ism @xcite .",
    "however , previous simulations have failed to successfully disperse the clouds with stellar feedback @xcite . while it is possible that the feedback methods employed within the simulations are ineffective for numerical reasons",
    ", there is also strong observational evidence to suggest that clouds are not in free - fall .",
    "rather , internal turbulent motions and magnetic fields seem to control the dynamics of the clouds and prevent the rapid conversion of gas into stars @xcite .",
    "support for clouds being turbulent structures stretches back to the early 1980s with the seminal paper by @xcite .",
    "since then , it has become widely accepted that gmcs are supersonically turbulent and this must play a crucial role in star formation @xcite .",
    "this then leads to the question of the origin of this turbulence . without a fresh injection of energy , turbulent modes inside a cloud",
    "will decay over a crossing time , @xmath11 and the clouds would quickly collapse and form stars at a high rate @xcite .",
    "a force is therefore needed to drive the turbulence in the clouds , either from the inside through stellar feedback , or from the outside via shear or interactions with neighbouring clouds @xcite .",
    "evidence for the latter comes from previous simulations of cloud formation . even without the inclusion of star formation ,",
    "global simulations forming clouds through self - gravitational collapse find good agreement with observations for the typical properties such as mass , radius and velocity dispersion @xcite . including turbulence in analytical theories of star formation also produces a good match with observed star formation rates and predictions of the initial mass function of stars @xcite and star formation rates and efficiencies @xcite .",
    "this suggests that gmc evolution may be largely governed by gravity and turbulence driven by interactions within their galactic environment .",
    "indeed , @xcite and @xcite find that cloud collisions are common , occurring multiple times per orbital period .",
    "observations also support this view , with suggestions that the turbulence itself is dominated by larger - scale modes and the existence of clouds such as the maddalena cloud and pipe nebula which have a low star formation rate @xcite . to understand how gmcs convert their gas into stars",
    ", we must first understand the properties of the turbulence .",
    "information about the turbulence can be found in the gas probability density function ( pdf ) . in an isothermal system ,",
    "the gas density pdf has a log - normal form @xcite , with the width of the pdf increasing with mach number ; @xmath12 , where @xmath1 is the standard deviation of the gas density , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the mean density , @xmath2 is the rms mach number of the turbulence and @xmath0 is a proportionality factor related to whether the turbulence is driven by a solenoidal ( divergence - free ) driver or by a compressive ( curl - free ) driver @xcite .",
    "solenoidal and compressive driving of the turbulence gives rise to extremely different density distributions and the value of @xmath0 is determined by the relative mix of the two . in the case of fully solenoidal driving , the proportionality term becomes @xmath15 , while fully compressive driving yields @xmath16 @xcite .    in a @xmath17 sized simulation of supernova - driven turbulence performed by @xcite",
    ", @xcite found a ratio of compressible to solenoidal velocity modes of about @xmath18 , which @xcite suggested may relate to an average @xmath19 .",
    "this suggests a significant fraction of compressible modes in the turbulence driving .",
    "observationally , @xcite estimated @xmath20 from @xmath21co line observations of the taurus molecular cloud , using the projected 2d column density .",
    "@xcite found a slightly lower ( more solenoidal ) value of @xmath22 , for the milky way s infrared dark ( non - star forming ) clouds , however , they did not take into account the magnetic pressure contribution to the standard deviation ",
    "mach number relation .",
    "this can result in an underestimate of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "@xcite also observed a non - star forming cloud and concluded the turbulence was compressively driven with a lower limit of @xmath23 .",
    "most recently , @xcite determined the @xmath24 parameter in the central molecular zone ( cmz ) cloud g0.253 + 0.016 ` brick ' , indicating primarily solenoidal driving due to strong shearing motions in the cmz .",
    "this is in contrast to clouds in the galactic disc for which @xmath19 , indicating strong contributions from compressive modes in the turbulence driving ( see review of the currently available disc clouds for which estimates of @xmath0 are available in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the turbulence properties of clouds formed in a high - resolution ( minimum computational cell size of @xmath25pc ) galactic - scale simulation .",
    "our main motivation is to explore how turbulence that is driven on the galactic scale through disc shear and cloud interactions travels down to the cloud scale . by measuring the value of @xmath0 in the resultant cloud population",
    ", we explore the relative strengths of the solenoidal and compressive modes and how these vary between the clouds and over their lifetime .",
    "no initial @xmath0 parameter is imposed on the simulation and the turbulence is allowed to develop self - consistently through hydrodynamical and gravitational interactions in the disc .",
    "section  [ sec : methods ] explains the galaxy simulation and the methods for cloud identification and tracking , section  [ sec : results ] presents our results and in section  [ sec : conclusions ] , we summarise our conclusions .",
    "our simulation was performed using _ enzo _ ; a three - dimensional adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) hydrodynamics code @xcite .",
    "the galaxy is simulated in a three - dimensional box of side @xmath26 with a root grid of @xmath27 cells and eight levels of refinement , giving a limiting resolution of @xmath28 .",
    "cells were refined whenever the jeans length dropped to less than four times the cell size @xcite or whenever the density contrast between neighbouring cells exceeded a factor of 10 . to ensure the galaxy is stable in the absence of cooling ,",
    "the whole disc region is kept at a minimum of two levels of refinement in addition to the root grid ( @xmath29pc ) throughout the simulation , over a height of 1kpc above and below the disc . within the radii of our main region of analysis ( see below ) and up to 100pc from the mid - plane , all gas is kept refined to at least level three ( @xmath30pc ) .",
    "the adaptive mesh then acts to refine 23% of the gas to level four ( @xmath31pc ) , 10% of the gas to level five ( @xmath32pc ) , 4% to level six ( @xmath33pc ) , 1.3% of the gas to level seven ( @xmath34pc ) and 0.5% of the gas to level eight ( @xmath35pc ) .",
    "however , within the clouds themselves , 89% of the gas is covered by level eight .",
    "_ enzo _ evolves the gas using a three - dimensional version of the zeus hydro - scheme , which uses an artificial viscosity term to handle shocks @xcite .",
    "the variable associated with this is the quadratic artificial viscosity term and was set to its default value of @xmath36 .",
    "the gas cools radiatively to @xmath37 using a one - dimensional cooling curve created from the cloudy package s cooling table for metals and _ enzo _ s non - equilibrium cooling rates for atomic species of hydrogen and helium @xcite .",
    "this minimum value is close to that of the gmcs . at this temperature ,",
    "the sound speed of the gas is @xmath38 .",
    "the weakness of this model is that the gas is assumed to be optically thin and non - molecular ; both untrue within the gmcs . for identifying the gmcs themselves ,",
    "the lack of molecular gas is not necessarily an issue , since it is thought to be a good tracer the overall gas distribution @xcite .",
    "the problem with the cloud internal dynamics is fundamentally a problem with resolution which we discuss more thoroughly at the end of this paper .    to prevent unresolved gas from collapsing , a pressure floor is imposed when the jeans length becomes less than four times the cell size @xcite .",
    "when this operates , an artificial pressure is calculated which results in a change to the velocity flow into that cell , suppressing collapse .",
    "the true pressure and internal energy is unchanged , so this adjustment is not advected through the simulation but calculated locally when required .",
    "the disc also includes a radially dependent photoelectric heating described in the detail in @xcite , but does not include any star formation , stellar feedback or magnetic fields .",
    "the simulation therefore concentrates on the early stages of star formation and the environment of the young gas cloud evolution .    to minimise artefacts from the orientation of the cartesian mesh ,",
    "the simulation sets a co - rotation point at a radius of @xmath39 @xcite . at this radius ,",
    "gas does not move with respect to the grid , removing potential numerical artefacts during the circular gas flow through the cartesian system .",
    "to maximise our efforts on this region , the highest refinement level is confined to an annulus of thickness @xmath40 over the co - rotation point , from @xmath41 to @xmath42 .",
    "our clouds are therefore analysed from inside this region .",
    "this refinement strategy allows us to achieve the best possible resolution for the clouds and at the same allows us to maintain realistic boundary conditions by modelling an entire galactic disc .",
    "the galaxy itself is an isolated milky way - type disc , with a flat rotation curve and circular velocity of @xmath43kms@xmath44 .",
    "as the disc cools , it gravitationally fragments as the toomre @xmath45 parameter drops below the stability threshold .",
    "toomre @xmath45 is defined as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the epicyclic frequency , @xmath48 is defined as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the 1d velocity dispersion of the gas motion in the plane of the disc and @xmath51 is the sound speed ( our discs are initialized with @xmath52 ) , and @xmath53 is the gas surface density .",
    "a value @xmath54 corresponds to a gravitationally stable disc , while @xmath55 suggests an unstable state . in our main disc region between @xmath56@xmath57",
    ", we set the @xmath45 initially to @xmath58 .",
    "as the disc cools , the gas fragments into the clouds , which can then grow and evolve through mergers and interactions . the initial fragmentation and evolution of the gas disc",
    "is described in @xcite . by modelling the global disc , the effect of galactic shear and cloud interactions",
    "are naturally included .",
    "these are some of the driving forces for the cloud internal turbulence @xcite with many other driving mechanisms contributing @xcite .",
    "we note that magnetic fields were not included in the simulations .",
    "magnetic fields are important for the structure and dynamics of the ism @xcite , but instead of including all of the relevant detailed physics , we here focus on improving the aspect of initial and boundary conditions for cloud formation and dynamics .",
    "follow - up simulations are need that include magnetic fields , detailed molecular chemistry and cooling , as well as star formation feedback , such as supernova explosions @xcite .",
    "the strength of the present simulations is that they model a global galactic disc , thus providing better initial and boundary conditions for cloud formation than previous simulations .",
    "we identify clouds in our simulation using constant density contours at @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) , where the clouds are then the coherent structures within the contour line ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "the threshold density for the cloud contour was selected based on the observed mean density of typical gmcs . because the internal properties of the smaller clouds will be poorly resolved",
    ", we restrict our cloud analysis to clouds containing more than 1000  cells , giving an approximate 10  cells in each dimension , which is a the absolute minimum to capture the main fraction of rotational modes @xcite .",
    "the exception to this is the resolution studies in section  [ sec : resolution ] , where differences in cell size result in too stringent a sub - selection of the cloud population , so we do not impose a minimum number of cells for the presentation of the resolution study below . at our two main analysis times of 60myr and 240myr , the total number of clouds in our highest - resolution simulation ( @xmath61 ) analysed is 1529 and 1313 , respectively .    to follow the evolution of the clouds , we output the simulation data every @xmath62 and track the clouds between these data sets , assigning a unique tag number to the same structure at different times .",
    "if a cloud disappears during the evolution , we search for possible merger events and if unsuccessful , mark it as dispersed .",
    "a detailed description of the tracking algorithm can be found in @xcite , although the cloud identification matches that in @xcite .      as described in the introduction , a key value for quantifying the cloud internal turbulence is the @xmath0 parameter , defined as the proportionality constant of the standard deviation ",
    "mach number relation for non - magnetized and non - self - gravitating gas . for each cloud , @xmath63 where @xmath1 is the standard deviation of the gas density , @xmath13 , within the cloud , normalised by the cloud mean density , @xmath14 .",
    "the cloud s turbulent mach number , @xmath64 , is given by the volume - weighted average of the local ( cell - based ) mach number , where @xmath65 and @xmath51 are the three - dimensional velocity dispersion and sound speed , respectively .",
    "finally , @xmath0 is the turbulence driving parameter @xcite , which we concentrate on measuring here .",
    "this can be related to the gas density pdf if the latter is assumed to follow a log - normal distribution , @xmath66 , \\label{eq : log_normal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is the standard deviation of the logarithmic gas density with @xmath68 . in which case , @xmath0 can be related to @xmath67 with @xmath69 .",
    "however , note that this expression is dependent on the log - normal distribution of the gas , while equation  [ eq : b_parameter ] applies for any density pdf @xcite .",
    "the turbulence driving parameter @xmath0 is determined by the mix of the solenoidal and compressive turbulent modes in the acceleration field that drives the turbulence .",
    "for fully solenoidal forcing ( divergence - free ) , @xmath70 , while fully compressive forcing ( curl - free ) finds @xmath71 in three - dimensional simulations @xcite .    to estimate @xmath0 from the turbulent motions inside a cloud , we must first subtract the cloud s global motions @xcite .",
    "the velocity dispersion is therefore calculated after the subtraction of the linear and angular momentum from the cloud motion .",
    "this is done by first subtracting the bulk velocity from the cloud s centre - of - mass .",
    "the cloud can then be regarded as a rigid body whose circular velocity about the core can be subtracted : @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the position vector relative to the centre - of - mass , @xmath74 is the angular velocity and @xmath75 is the total angular momentum .",
    "the three - dimensional velocity dispersion about the cloud s centre - of - mass then becomes , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the velocity of the gas , @xmath78 is the cloud s centre - of - mass velocity and @xmath79 is the circular velocity from the angular momentum about the cloud s centre .",
    "the co - rotating , high - resolution region where we define the clouds is within the two white circles . ]",
    "the face - on view of the surface density in the whole galactic disc at @xmath80 ( one orbital period at the outer edge of our analysis region at @xmath81kpc . ) is shown in figure  [ fig : figure1 ] .",
    "the two white circles mark the inner and outer boundary of the high - resolution co - rotating region where we analyse the clouds . using this technique we have a region with high resolution ( @xmath82 ) and at the same time include the global disc potential , with the appropriate boundary conditions for the high - resolution region .",
    "since we do not drive a global spiral potential , the disc gas has a predominately flocculent structure , with the dense knots of cloud gas being connected by a filamentary warm ism .",
    "the environment is clearly not quiescent , but a continuously interacting medley of collisions and tidal forces that shape the clouds .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure2 ] describes the thermodynamical condition in the whole disc ism via a two - dimensional density - temperature diagram of the distribution in the gas mass .",
    "notably , there is no clear division in the gas between the hot , warm and cold ism phases , but a continuous distribution connecting the cold clouds with the surrounding material .    at densities @xmath83 ,",
    "the distribution becomes a steeply rising linear relation corresponding to the artificial pressure floor defined in section  [ sec : code ] . in this region",
    ", gas follows a polytrope with an adiabatic index of @xmath84 , which is shown by the dashed black line .",
    "the pressure floor halts the collapse and prevents the formation of isolated cells with very high densities in which the jeans length would otherwise not be resolved .",
    "while this regime was necessary to minimise numerical artifacts , it is clear that even on parsec scales , it is hard to resolve the molecular gas component of the clouds .",
    "exactly where the simulations start to become resolution limited will be studied further in section  [ sec : resolution ] .      ) for the high - resolution region of the disc ( between the white lines in figure  [ fig : figure1 ] ) with a height of @xmath85 . ]",
    "the evolution of the structure of the ism can be explored using the density .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure3 ] shows the volume - weighted density pdf for the high - resolution region of the galaxy marked between the two white circles in figure  [ fig : figure1 ] .",
    "four different simulation times are shown at 30myr , 60myr , 120myr and 240myr , with the additional vertical black dotted line showing the location of the cloud identification threshold , which sits at @xmath59 .    at the earliest time of 30myr",
    ", the galaxy disc is only partially fragmented .",
    "the pdf has a narrow profile that broadens as clouds form and begin to interact in the disc . from 60myr to 240myr",
    ", the profile continues to broaden but at a slower rate .",
    "equation  [ eq : b_parameter ] implies that the broadening of the pdf profile is due to an increase in the standard deviation of the logarithmic density .",
    "previous research has suggested that this can occur due to a shift from solenoidal turbulence driving to compressive driving for the same mach number @xcite .",
    "the evolution from a narrow to wide density pdf may therefore indicate a change from a largely solenoidal turbulence - dominated system to a more compressive regime as cloud and gas structures interact and collide .",
    "the cloud gas ( right of the vertical dashed line ) extends smoothly to higher densities , but with a profile that is not completely log - normal .",
    "while a log - normal distribution is expected from isothermal studies , deviations are frequently seen in other models due to shocks and other intermittent events @xcite . moreover , our gas is not isothermal and the highest density end may be gravitationally collapsing , with support coming from the pressure floor ( @xmath86 ) rather than internal turbulence .",
    "clouds are formed in the galaxy disc through hydrodynamical and gravitational fragmentation .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure4 ] shows a close - up of this process , displaying the surface density of the disc in a 2kpc region at early ( 60myr ) and late ( 240myr ) times .",
    "both images are taken within the analysis region shown in figure  [ fig : figure1 ] .",
    "the cloud environment changes substantially between these stages . at early times , the disc is in the process of fragmenting .",
    "its rotational motion supports the gas against radial collapse , causing the initial structures to be tangential filaments . as",
    "the disc becomes more unstable , the rotation can no longer support the gas which collapses to create gmcs .",
    "as the dynamical time is shortest in the inner disc , the left - hand image in figure  [ fig : figure3 ] shows this process occurring from right to left , with the outer gas on the right - hand side in an earlier state of collapse compared to the inner left - hand edge .",
    "by @xmath80 , the disc has completely fragmented and interactions between the clouds now dominate the local dynamics .",
    "close - ups of two typical clouds in the simulation are shown in figure  [ fig : figure5 ] .",
    "the properties for these clouds match the peak values in the distributions shown in figure  [ fig : figure6 ] .",
    "the left - hand cloud shows an interacting structure fragmented into three parts , while the right - hand cloud is a more quiescent object with a single core . despite these visual differences ,",
    "both clouds have similar mass , radii and velocity dispersions .",

    ", the peak value sits at @xmath92 .",
    "this has shifted slightly lower by 240myr .",
    "the change is due to the clouds fragmenting into smaller structures as the disc finishes its period of instability .",
    "both plots overlay the observed milky way profile , with approximately equivalent peak values .",
    "the simulation results have a high - mass tail due to the lack of star formation to remove the densest gas which increases over time .",
    "this creates a population of massive clouds whose bulk has built up via successive mergers and accretion .",
    "its existence underscores the importance of interactions in the evolution of the clouds .",
    "the high - mass tail causes the standard deviation in cloud mass at @xmath80 ( @xmath93 ) to be significantly larger than that at @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) , as shown in table  [ tab : table1 ] . note that the mass here is plotted on a logarithmic scale ( non - gaussian distribution ) , indicating that the clouds in this later stage have a wide range of masses",
    ". the smaller clouds in the milky way data are not seen in the simulation plot , as we focus on our best - resolved population containing more than 1000  cells per cloud .    the distribution in cloud radius is shown in the top right plot of figure  [ fig : figure6 ] .",

    "the average radius remains the same , with @xmath100 .",

    "the milky way data likewise finds that clouds sit on the brink of being bound , with the data showing a broad range of values .",

    "the peak value of mach number at @xmath80 is @xmath115 , which is slightly lower than @xmath116 at @xmath94 .",
    "this comes from the broader range in velocity dispersion at later times that we saw in the plot above ; the broadening at 240myr causes the velocity dispersion to peak at a lower value .",
    "a similar but weaker trend can be seen in the distribution of the standard deviation , @xmath1 ; namely clouds in the later stage generate lower @xmath1 than early on in the simulations .",

    "this likely stems directly from each cloud s history , determined by interactions , birth location and the local environment .",

    "the reason for this agreement can be seen from the last panels in figure  [ fig : figure6 ] , where the peaks in both the mach number and standard deviation @xmath1 shift slightly towards lower values with time , compensating for one another to give the same average @xmath0 . physically speaking",
    ", this supports the picture that the clouds break into smaller clouds during the disc gravitational fragmentation and subsequent cloud interactions . while some clouds merge to form the high - end tail of the mass distribution , a substantial fraction of clouds have a lower mach number and density contrast post - fragmentation , which balance to give a similar mix of turbulence modes .",
    "this average value of @xmath0 indicates that the clouds in the galaxy simulation are typically dominated by solenoidal turbulence driving .",
    "however , in the next section we will note this is a strictly lower limit , because of the limited numerical resolution currently achievable in these simulations of disc galaxies .    more important than the average value of @xmath0 ( which is not converged with resolution )",
    ", we find a very wide distribution of @xmath0 , with values covering the full range from purely solenoidal ( @xmath4 ) to purely compressive driving ( @xmath5 ) and mixed values in between .",
    "thus , the turbulence driving parameter for individual clouds is far from constant .",
    "this shows that @xmath0 should be considered a varying parameter that changes between individual clouds .",
    "the range of @xmath0 values in the cloud population increases with simulation time , as the distribution at 240myr in figure  [ fig : figure7 ] is somewhat broader than at 60myr .",
    "this suggests that a cloud s history or its environment might be controlling the evolution of @xmath0 . to test the idea that clouds are born with a constant @xmath0 and interactions drive more compressive or solenoidal driving",

    "the lines show different values of @xmath0 , with the blue - dashed , green - solid , red - dotted and cyan - dot - dash showing the best fit for @xmath0 in each of the cloud age data sets with the same colour . ]    as described in section  [ sec : cloud_definition ] , we followed the evolution of @xmath0 for individual clouds by tracking them between simulation outputs .",
    "we did this for clouds between 220240myrs , during the fully fragmented phase of the disc where cloud interactions dominated their evolution . in figure",
    "[ fig : figure8 ] , clouds that are between @xmath122@xmath128myr old are marked in dark blue , clouds between @xmath9@xmath129myr old are in green , @xmath124@xmath130myr old clouds are in red and @xmath126@xmath131myr old clouds are cyan points .",
    "lines of the same colour show the best - fit @xmath0 parameter for each population .",
    "there is initially a small amount of evolution in @xmath0 as the cloud ages , moving from an average @xmath132 for the youngest clouds towards an average @xmath133 for clouds between @xmath124@xmath130myr .",
    "however , this number decreases again slightly for the oldest clouds . while not major changes , these are likely to be due to the changes in compressive modes as the cloud undergoes interactions during its life . however , this effect is clearly weak , suggesting no strong relation between the turbulence modes and cloud mergers or lifetime .",
    "we also attempted to find a stronger correlation by examining the values of @xmath0 before and after individual recorded mergers .",
    "no emerging trend was seen , with @xmath0 staying approximately constant during the interaction .",
    "it appears instead that clouds overall retain the @xmath0 they are formed with , although this value can take on a wide range of numbers .      , ( thin line histogram ) and its turbulent component , @xmath134 ( thick line histogram )",
    ". the mean and standard deviation of these distributions are @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "the thin and thick curves are log - normal fits to the distributions as in @xcite . ]    our main goal here is to quantify the relative strength of solenoidal to compressive modes in the turbulence driving of molecular clouds formed by galactic dynamics and cloud - cloud collisions .",
    "an important diagnostic of this is the _ compressive ratio _",
    "@xcite , which quantifies the fraction of compressive modes in the turbulent velocity field . here",
    "we follow the recent definition of the compressive ratio proposed in @xcite , @xmath137 where @xmath138 and @xmath139 are the compressive and solenoidal components of the velocity field , respectively .",
    "the two velocity components are derived with the helmholtz decomposition of the velocity field in fourier space ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to the total compressive ratio @xmath140 given by equation  ( [ eq : compratio ] ) , we consider a purely turbulent version , @xmath134 , where we subtracted the centre - of - mass velocity as well as the mean velocities @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 in spherical shells centred on the centre of mass of each cloud in spherical coordinates ( @xmath144,@xmath145,@xmath146 ) @xcite .",
    "this removes systematic motions from the velocity field such that only turbulent fluctuations remain .",
    "this method is similar to the method used in @xcite to remove systematic motions and to isolate the turbulence in the clouds .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure9 ] shows the frequency distribution of the total compressive ratio @xmath140 and the turbulent compressive ratio @xmath134 of all the clouds with at least 1000 cells in our sample . similar to the distributions of the turbulent driving parameter @xmath0 , we find broad distributions of the compressive ratio , with values of @xmath140 covering a wide range from purely solenoidal ( @xmath147 ) to strongly compressive ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "the mean and standard deviation of these distributions are @xmath135 and @xmath136 , suggesting that most clouds are dominated by solenoidal modes .",
    "this is similar to the conclusion drawn from the sample of clouds in @xcite , who find broad distributions and typical values of @xmath149 from simulations of supernova driving .",
    "our values of @xmath140 are slightly lower , which is expected for turbulence purely driven by galactic dynamics ( which drives solenoidal motions due to galactic shear ) compared to turbulence driven by supernova explosions ( which drive more compressive modes compared to galactic shear ) @xcite .    in agreement with @xcite",
    "we do not find a significant difference between the total and turbulent compressive ratio .",
    "the most likely explanation for the similarity of @xmath140 and @xmath134 is that for @xmath134 one removes systematic compressive motions ( infall ) from the numerator @xmath150 and at the same time removes systematic solenoidal motions ( large - scale rotation ) from the denominator @xmath151 , such that the ratio of the two nearly stays the same .    in summary",
    ", we find broad distributions of the compressive ratio of our cloud sample formed by galactic dynamics and cloud - cloud collisions , with typical values of @xmath152 , i.e. , dominated by solenoidal modes .",
    "following the suggestions by @xcite , this value of @xmath140 may be related to the turbulence driving parameter @xmath153^{1/2}\\sim0.4 $ ] , which is broadly consistent with the average value of @xmath0 found directly in section  [ sec : drivingmode ] .      , with resolution .",
    "we find that the average @xmath0 value increases systematically with increasing resolution , which means that our measurements represent lower limits .",
    "however , every resolution shows that @xmath0 varies by factors of a few within the cloud population . ]",
    "one important consideration in our quantification of the turbulence driving parameter @xmath0 is the effect of numerical resolution of the simulations . while the simulation refines down to cells with sizes",
    "@xmath154 , the internal cloud turbulence is a challenging property to resolve and converge on . to test the robustness of our quantitative values , we compared simulations at four different refinement levels , corresponding to limiting resolutions ( smallest cell size ) of @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 and our main simulation resolution at @xmath154 .",
    "the resulting values for the cloud parameter @xmath0 at each resolution are shown in figure  [ fig : figure10 ] .",
    "the dark blue line shows the distribution for our main simulation run , while green , red and cyan mark the distributions for simulations of decreasing resolution .",
    "the legend shows the average @xmath0 value with its standard deviation . due to the large size of the cells in the lower - resolution run ,",
    "figures  [ fig : figure10 ] and accompanying figure  [ fig : figure11 ] show all clouds in the simulation , not only those with cell number above  1000 .",
    "our resolution test shows a systematic dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath158 , with the turbulence value increasing at higher resolutions ( decreasing @xmath158 ) . in our lowest resolution simulation with @xmath155 ( cyan line ) , the average @xmath0 for all clouds is 0.09 .",
    "this increases to @xmath18 for a limiting resolution of @xmath154 , showing an increase in the resolved compressive modes .",
    "such a trend means that we can not determine an absolute value for @xmath0 in our global models and the average value of @xmath120 should be considered a lower limit even in the highest - resolution simulations .",
    "the standard deviation in the values for @xmath0 also increases with resolution , although this is likely to be due to the wider range in cloud sizes that the smaller cells allow , as we will investigate next .",
    "the origin of the resolution dependence of @xmath0 can be seen in figure  [ fig : figure11 ] .",
    "the three panels show how the profiles for the 3d volume - weighted mach number , standard deviation @xmath1 and the cloud radius vary with resolution .",
    "the mach number profile shows a nearly constant distribution shape past our lowest resolution level , suggesting that this property has converged in the simulations .",
    "however , both the standard deviation of density fluctuations and the radius of the clouds shift to systematically higher and lower values , respectively , with increasing resolution .",
    "full convergence is likely to be achieved when the simulation resolves the sonic scale ( @xmath159pc ) , where the turbulence transitions from supersonic to subsonic @xcite .",
    "this is because below the sonic scale , the turbulent density fluctuations become small compared to the large - scale supersonic fluctuations .",
    "the sonic scale is also the scale on which filaments and dense cores are expected to form @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this is still out of reach for our global galaxy simulations .",
    "future galaxy simulations , however , will be able to reach down to sub - pc scales .    for the main result of this work",
    ", we emphasise that despite the resolution dependence of the exact value of @xmath0 , all resolutions show that the cloud population has a wide distribution of @xmath0 values , indicating that galaxy dynamics and cloud - cloud collisions alone ( without feedback from star formation ) can produce the full range of cloud driving parameters , from purely solenoidal driving ( @xmath4 ) to purely compressive driving ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "we thus expect that these clouds can have a wide range of star formation activity , as star formation depends critically on the driving and statistics of the turbulence @xcite .",
    "we performed a three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulation of a global isolated disc galaxy and explored the turbulence properties in the giant molecular cloud population formed through self - gravity and cloud interactions .",
    "the turbulent modes were quantitatively explored by using the turbulence driving parameter @xmath0 , which is around @xmath18 for solenoidal modes and @xmath128 for purely compressive driving of the turbulence .",
    "our main results are as follows .    1 .   in the early and the late stages of galaxy disc evolution ,",
    "the average @xmath0 for the cloud population is almost the same at @xmath160 .",
    "this is despite the morphology of the disc structure being quite different , due to only being partially fragmented at the earlier times .",
    "our subsequent resolution study indicated that this average value of @xmath0 is a strictly lower limit on the true value and resolution down to @xmath161pc is likely required to achieve convergence .",
    "2 .   the distribution of @xmath0 exhibits wide scatter through the cloud population with @xmath0 varying by factors of a few .",
    "this means that each cloud can have a significantly different turbulence driving mode , ranging from purely solenoidal , divergence - free driving ( @xmath162 ) to purely compressive , curl - free driving ( @xmath163 ) .",
    "the main result of a wide distribution of turbulence properties of the clouds is supported by calculations of the compressive ratio ; the ratio of compressive to solenoidal modes in the turbulent velocity field , @xmath140 .",
    "values of @xmath140 likewise took on a wide range , with the mean value of @xmath164 , suggesting primarily solenoidal modes on average , but with individual clouds having values reaching far into the highly compressible regime .",
    "we tracked the clouds through the simulation to compare changes during the cloud lifetime .",
    "clouds live in a highly dynamic environment with multiple interactions occurring over the cloud s life . despite this",
    ", we find that the @xmath0 distribution does not depend significantly on the cloud age .",
    "we conclude that the turbulent modes within gmcs do not significantly depend on the evolutionary stage of the galaxy disc , nor on the merger history of a cloud .",
    "however , there is always a wide distribution of modes found within the cloud population .",
    "this means that a constant @xmath0 can not be selected , but must instead be treated as a varying parameter when looking at individual clouds .",
