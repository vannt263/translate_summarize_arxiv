    "exclusive processes at large momentum transfer are described in terms of hard scatterings among quarks and gluons @xcite . in this so - called hard scattering approach ( hsa ) a hadronic amplitude is represented by a convolution of process independent distribution amplitudes ( da ) with hard scattering amplitudes to be calculated within perturbative qcd .",
    "the das specify the distribution of the longitudinal momentum fractions the constituents carry .",
    "they represent fock state wave functions integrated over transverse momenta .",
    "the convolution manifestly factorizes long ( das ) and short distance physics ( hard scattering ) .",
    "it however turned out that most processes are not dominated by the perturbative contribution at experimentally accessible values of momentum transfer .",
    "non - perturbative dynamics still plays a crucial role in that kinematical region and , hence , the hsa although likely the correct asymptotic picture for exclusive reactions , needs modifications .    in a series of papers @xcite-@xcite",
    "such a modification has been proposed in which baryons are viewed as being composed of quarks and diquarks .",
    "the latter are treated as quasi - elementary constituents which partly survive medium hard collisions .",
    "diquarks are an effective description of correlations in the wave functions and constitute a particular model for non - perturbative effects . the diquark model may be viewed as a variant of the hsa appropriate for moderately large momentum transfer and it is designed in such a way that it evolves into the standard pure quark hsa asymptotically . in so far the standard hsa and the diquark model do not oppose each other , they are not alternatives but rather complements . the existence of diquarks is a hypothesis . however , from experimental and theoretical approaches there have been many indications suggesting the presence of diquarks . for instance , they were introduced in baryon spectroscopy , in nuclear physics , in astrophysics , in jet fragmentation and in weak interactions to explain the famous @xmath0 rule .",
    "diquarks also provide a natural explanation of the equal slopes of meson and baryon regge trajectories . for more details and for references , see @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that qcd provides some attraction between two quarks in a colour @xmath1 state at short distances as is to be seen from the static reduction of the one - gluon exchange term .    even more important for our aim",
    ", diquarks have also been found to play a role in inclusive hard scattering reactions .",
    "the most obvious place to signal their presence is deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering . indeed",
    "the higher twist contributions , convincingly observed by the nmc @xcite , can be modelled as lepton - diquark elastic scattering .",
    "baryon production in inclusive @xmath2 collisions also reveals the need for diquarks scattered elastically in the hard interaction @xcite .",
    "for instance , kinematical dependences or the excess of the proton yield over the antiproton yield find simple explanations in the diquark model .",
    "no other explanation of these phenomena is known as yet .",
    "as in the standard hsa a helicity amplitude for the reaction @xmath3 is expressed as a convolution of das and hard scattering amplitudes ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 @xmath7 ) @xmath8 where helicity labels are omitted for convenience . implicitly it is assumed in ( [ helamp ] ) that the valence fock states consist of only two constituents , a quark and a diquark ( antiquark ) in the case of baryons ( mesons ) . in so far the specification of the quark momentum fraction",
    "@xmath9 suffices ; the diquark ( antiquark ) carries the momentum fraction @xmath10 . if an external particle is point - like , e.g. a photon , the corresponding da is to be replaced by @xmath11 . as in the standard hsa contributions from higher fock states",
    "are neglected .",
    "this is justified by the fact that that such contributions are suppressed by powers of @xmath12 as compared to that from the valence fock state ( if only s - wave hadrons are involved ) .    in the diquark model spin @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) and spin @xmath15 ( @xmath16 )",
    "colour antitriplet diquarks are considered . within flavour su(3 )",
    "the @xmath14 diquark forms an antitriplet , the @xmath16 diquark an sextet .",
    "assuming zero relative orbital angular momentum between quark and diquark and taking advantage of the collinear approximation , the valence fock state of a ground state octet baryon @xmath17 with helicity @xmath18 and momentum @xmath19 can be written in a covariant fashion ( omitting colour indices ) @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the baryon s spinor .",
    "the two terms in ( [ pwf ] ) represent configurations consisting of a quark and either a scalar or a vector diquark , respectively .",
    "the couplings of the diquarks with the quarks in a baryon lead to flavour functions which e.g.  for the proton read @xmath22}\\hspace{2 cm }   b_v= [ u v_{\\{u , d\\ } } -\\sqrt{2 } d\\ , v_{\\{u , u\\}}]/\\sqrt{3}\\ , .\\ ] ] the das @xmath23 are conventionally normalized as @xmath24 .",
    "the constants @xmath25 and @xmath26 play the role of the configuration space wave functions at the origin .",
    "+ the das containing the complicated non - perturbative bound state physics , can not be calculated from qcd at present .",
    "it is still necessary to parameterize the das and to fit the eventual free parameters to experimental data .",
    "hence , both the models , the standard hsa as well as the diquark model , only get a predictive power when a number of reactions involving the same hadrons is investigated . in the diquark model the following das have been proven to work satisfactorily well in many applications @xcite-@xcite : @xmath27}\\\\ \\phi^b_v(x)&\\hspace{-0.3cm}=&\\hspace{-0.3cm}n^b_v x ( 1-x)^3 ( 1 + 5.8\\,x - 12.5\\,x^2 ) \\exp{\\left[-b^2 ( m^2_q / x + m^2_v/(1-x))\\right]}. \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the constants @xmath28 and @xmath29 are fixed through the normalization ( e.g.  for the proton @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) .",
    "the das exhibit a mild flavour dependence via the exponential whose other purpose is to guarantee a strong suppression of the end - point regions .",
    "the parameters appearing in the exponentials are not considered as free parameters since the final results ( form factors , amplitudes ) depend on their actual values only mildly .",
    "the following values for the parameters are chosen : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "it is to be stressed that the quark and diquark masses only appear in the das ( [ a10 ] ) ; in the hard scattering kinematics they are neglected .",
    "the hard scattering amplitudes @xmath35 , determined by short - distance physics , are calculated from a set of feyman graphs relevant to a given process .",
    "diquark - gluon and diquark - photon vertices appear in these graphs which , following standard prescriptions , are defined as @xmath36_{\\alpha } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad\\quad\\quad - g_{\\mu\\alpha } \\left[(1+\\kappa)\\,p_1-\\kappa\\ , p_2\\right]_{\\beta }   \\big\\ } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the qcd coupling constant .",
    "@xmath38 is the anomalous magnetic moment of the vector diquark and @xmath39 the gell - mann colour matrix . for the coupling of photons to diquarks one has to replace @xmath40 by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the fine structure constant and @xmath43",
    "is the electrical charge of the diquark in units of the elementary charge .",
    "the couplings @xmath44 are supplemented by appropriate contact terms required by gauge invariance .",
    "+ the composite nature of the diquarks is taken into account by phenomenological vertex functions .",
    "advice for the parameterization of the 3-point functions ( diquark form factors ) is obtained from the requirement that asymptotically the diquark model evolves into the standard hsa .",
    "interpolating smoothly between the required asymptotic behaviour and the conventional value of 1 at @xmath45 , the diquark form factors are actually parametrized as @xmath46 the asymptotic behaviour of the diquark form factors and the connection to the hard scattering model is discussed in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . in accordance with the required asymptotic behaviour",
    "the @xmath47-point functions for @xmath48 are parametrized as @xmath49 the constants @xmath50 are strength parameters . indeed , since the diquarks in intermediate states are rather far off - shell one has to consider the possibility of diquark excitation and break - up .",
    "both these possibilities would likely lead to inelastic reactions .",
    "therefore , we have not to consider these possibilities explicitly in our approach but excitation and break - up lead to a certain amount of absorption which is taken into account by the strength parameters . admittedly , that recipe is a rather crude approximation for @xmath48 .",
    "since in most cases the contributions from the n - point functions for @xmath48 only provide small corrections to the final results that recipe is sufficiently accurate .    the diquark hypothesis has striking consequences .",
    "it reduces the effective number of constituents inside baryons and , hence , alters the power laws . in elastic baryon - baryon scattering , for instance , the usual power @xmath51 becomes @xmath52 where @xmath53 represents the net effect of diquark form factors .",
    "asymptotically @xmath53 provides the missing four powers of @xmath4 . in the kinematical region in which the diquark model can be applied ( @xmath5 , @xmath54 ) ,",
    "the diquark form factors are already active , i.e.  they supply a substantial @xmath4 dependence and , hence , the effective power of @xmath4 lies somewhere between 6 and 10 .",
    "the hadronic helicity is not conserved in the diquark model at finite momentum transfer since vector diquarks can flip their helicities when interacting with gluons .",
    "thus , in contrast to the standard hsa , spin - flip dependent quantities like the pauli form factor of the nucleon can be calculated .",
    "this is the simplest application of the diquark model and the most obvious place to fix the various parameters of the model .",
    "the dirac and pauli form factors of the nucleon are evaluated from the convolution formula ( [ helamp ] ) with the das ( [ a10 ] ) and the parameters are determined from a best fit to the data in the space - like region .",
    "the following set of parameters @xmath55 provides a good fit of the data @xcite .",
    "@xmath56 is evaluated with @xmath57 and restricted to be smaller than @xmath58 .",
    "the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 , controlling the size of the diquarks , are in agreement with the higher - twist effects observed in the structure functions of deep inelastic lepton - hadron scattering @xcite if these effects are modelled as lepton - diquark elastic scattering .",
    "the dirac and the pauli form factors of the proton are very well reproduced .",
    "the predictions for the two neutron form factors are also in agreement with the data . however , more accurate neutron data are needed in the @xmath61 region of interest in order to determine the model parameters better . the nucleon s axial form factor @xcite and its electromagnetic form factors in the time - like regions @xcite have also been evaluated .",
    "both the results compare well with data .",
    "even electroexcitation of nucleon resonances has been investigated @xcite . in the case of the @xmath62 form factor",
    "the model results agree very well with the data presented in @xcite while the model seems to provide to large values for the coulomb form factor @xcite .",
    "@xmath63 is the next reaction to which the diquark model is applied to .",
    "since the only hadrons involved are again protons rcs can be predicted in the diquark model without any adjustable parameter .",
    "the results of the diquark model for rcs are shown in fig .",
    "[ frcc ] for three different photon energies @xcite .",
    "( 160,60 ) ( 30,0 ) ( 85,3 )    note that in the very forward and backward regions the transverse momentum of the outgoing photon is small and , hence , the diquark model which is based on perturbative qcd , is not applicable . despite the rather small energies at which data @xcite are available , the diquark model is seen to work rather well .",
    "the predicted cross section does not strictly scale with @xmath64 .",
    "the results obtained within the standard hsa are of similar quality @xcite .",
    "a purely soft , overlap - like contribution can also explain these data @xcite .",
    "the diquark model also predicts interesting photon asymmetries and spin correlation parameters ( see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "even a polarization of the proton , of the order of @xmath65 , is obtained @xcite .",
    "this comes about as a consequence of helicity flips generated by vector diquarks and of perturbative phases produced by propagator poles appearing within the domains of the momentum fraction integrations .",
    "the appearance of phases to leading order of @xmath66 is a non - trivial prediction of perturbative qcd @xcite ; it is characteristic of the hsa and is not a consequence of the diquark hypothesis .",
    "two - photon annihilation into @xmath67 pairs is related to rcs by crossing .",
    "the only difference is that now the diquark form factors are needed in the time - like region .",
    "the continuation of the diquark form factors from the space - like to the time - like region is described in @xcite .",
    "the diquark model predictions for the integrated @xmath68 cross section is compared to the cleo data @xcite in fig .",
    "[ time ] . at large energies",
    "the agreement between predictions and experiment is good .",
    "the predictions for the angular distributions are in agreement with the cleo data too .",
    "the diquark model predictions are also in agreement with the recent venus data @xcite .",
    "this process is accessible through @xmath69 .",
    "an interesting element in that reaction is that , besides vcs , there is also a contribution from the bethe - heitler ( bh ) process where the final state photon is emitted from the electron .",
    "electroproduction of photons offers many possibilities to test details of the dynamics : one may measure the @xmath4 , @xmath70 and @xmath61 dependence as well as that on the angle @xmath71 between the hadronic and leptonic scattering planes .",
    "this allows to isolate cross sections for longitudinal and transverse virtual photons .",
    "one may also use polarized beams and targets and last but not least one may measure the interference between the bh and the vc contributions .",
    "the interference is sensitive to phase differences .    at @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath72 ( or small @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the scattering angle of the outgoing photon in the photon - proton center of mass frame ) the diquark model",
    "can also be applied to vcs @xcite .",
    "again there is no free parameter in that calculation .",
    "the model can safely be applied for @xmath75 and @xmath76 . for the future cebaf beam energy of @xmath77",
    "the model is at its limits of applicability .",
    "however , since the diquark model predictions for real compton scattering agree rather well with the data even at @xmath78 ( see fig .  [ frcc ] ) one may expect similarly good agreement for vcs .",
    "predictions for the vcs cross section are given in @xcite .",
    "of interest is also the electron asymmetry in @xmath79 : @xmath80 where @xmath81 indicates the helicity of the incoming electron .",
    "@xmath82 measures the imaginary part of the longitudinal  transverse interference . according to the model",
    ", @xmath82 is large in the region of strong bh contamination ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : asym ] ) . in that region",
    ", @xmath82 measures the relative phase between the bh amplitudes    @xmath83    and the vcs ones .",
    "the magnitude of the effect shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : asym ] is sensitive to details of the model and , therefore , should not be taken literally . despite of this our results may be taken as an example of what may happen .",
    "the measurement of @xmath82 , e.g.  at cebaf , will elucidate the underlying dynamics of vcs strikingly .",
    "the diquark model which represents a variant of the hsa , combines perturbative qcd with non - perturbative elements .",
    "the diquarks represent quark - quark correlations in baryon wave functions which are modelled as quasi - elementary constituents .",
    "this model has been applied to many photon induced exclusive processes at moderarely large momentum transfer ( typically @xmath84 ) . from the analysis of the nucleon form factors the parameters specifying the diquark and the das , are fixed .",
    "compton scattering and two - photon annihilations of @xmath67 can then be predicted .",
    "the comparison with existing data reveals that the diquark model works quite well and in fact much better then the pure quark hsa .",
    "predictions for the vcs cross section and for the @xmath85 cross section have also been made for kinematical situations accessible at the upgraded cebaf and perhaps at future high energy accelerators like elfe@hera .",
    "according to the diquark model the bh contamination of the photon electroproduction becomes sizeable for small azimuthal angles .",
    "the bh contribution also offers the interesting possibility of measuring the relative phases between the vc and the bh amplitudes .",
    "the electron asymmetry @xmath82 is particularly sensitive to relative phases .",
    "in contrast to the standard hsa the diquark model allows to calculate helicity flip amplitudes , the helicity sum rule does not hold at finite @xmath61 .",
    "one example of an observable controlled by helicity flip contributions is the pauli form factor of the proton .",
    "also in this case the diquark model accounts for the data .",
