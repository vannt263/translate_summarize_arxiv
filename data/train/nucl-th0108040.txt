    "a fundamental problem in nuclear physics has been the determination of the effective nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath7 ) interaction used in the nuclear shell model , which has been successful in describing a variety of nuclear properties .",
    "there have been a number of successful approaches @xcite for this determination , ranging from empirical fits of experimental data , to deriving it microscopically from the bare @xmath7 potential . despite impressive quantitative successes ,",
    "the traditional microscopic approach suffers the fate of being `` model dependent '' owing to the fact that there is no unique @xmath1 to start from . moreover , as the brueckner @xmath2 matrix has traditionally been the starting point , one obtains different input interactions for nuclei in different mass regions as a result of the pauli blocking operator .    in this letter",
    ", we propose a different approach to shell model effective interactions that is motivated by the recent applications of effective field theory ( eft ) and the renormalization group ( rg ) to low energy nuclear systems@xcite .",
    "our aim is to remove some of the model dependence that arises at short distances in the various @xmath1 models , and also to eliminate the mass dependence one finds in the @xmath2 matrix approach , thus allowing the same interaction to be used in different nuclear regions such as @xmath3o and @xmath4te .",
    "a central theme of the rg - eft approach is that physics in the infrared region is insensitive to the details of the short distance dynamics .",
    "one can therefore have infinitely many theories that differ substantially at small distances , but still give the same low energy physics if they possess the same symmetries and the `` correct '' long - wavelength structure@xcite .",
    "the fact that the various meson models for @xmath1 share the same one pion tail , but differ significantly in how they treat the shorter distance pieces illustrates this explicitly as they give the same phase shifts and deuteron binding energy . in rg language , the short distance pieces of @xmath1 are like irrelevant operators since their detailed form can not be resolved from low energy data .",
    "motivated by these observations , we would like to derive a low - momentum nn potential @xmath0 by integrating out the high momentum components of different models of @xmath1 in the sense of the rg @xcite , and investigate its suitability of being used directly as a model independent effective interaction for shell model calculations .",
    "we shall use in the present work the cd - bonn nn potential @xcite for @xmath1 . in the following",
    ", we shall first describe our method for carrying out the high - momentum integration .",
    "shell model calculations for @xmath3o and @xmath4te using @xmath0 will then be performed .",
    "our results will be discussed , especially about their dependence on the cut - off momentum @xmath5 .",
    "the first step in our method is to integrate out the model dependent high momentum components of @xmath1 . in accordance with the general definition of a renormalization group transformation",
    ", the decimation must be such that low energy observables calculated in the full theory are exactly preserved by the effective theory .",
    "we turn to the model space methods of nuclear structure theory for guidance , as there has been much work in recent years discussing their similarity to the wilson rg approach@xcite .",
    "while the technical details differ , both approaches attempt to thin - out , or limit the degrees of freedom one must explicitly consider to describe the physics in some low energy regime .",
    "once the relevant low energy modes are identified , all remaining modes or states are `` integrated '' out .",
    "their effects are then implicitly buried inside the effective interaction in a manner that leaves the low energy observables invariant .",
    "one successful model - space reduction method is the kuo - lee - ratcliff ( klr ) folded diagram theory @xcite . for the nucleon - nucleon problem in vacuum",
    ", the rg approach simply means that the low momentum @xmath8 matrix and the deuteron binding energy calculated from @xmath1 must be reproduced by @xmath0 , but with all loop integrals cut off at some @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , we start from the half - on - shell t - matrix @xmath9 we then define an effective low - momentum t - matrix by @xmath10 where @xmath5 denotes a momentum space cut - off ( such as @xmath5=2@xmath6 ) and @xmath11 .",
    "we require the above t - matrices satisfying the condition @xmath12 the above equations define the effective low momentum interaction @xmath0 . in the following ,",
    "let us show that the above equations are satisfied by the solution @xmath13 which is just the klr folded - diagram effective interaction @xcite .",
    "a preliminary account of this result has been reported as a work in progress at a recent conference @xcite .    in time",
    "dependent formulation , the t - matrix of eq.(1 ) can be written as @xmath14 , @xmath15 being the time evolution operator . in this way",
    "we can readily perform a diagrammatic analysis of the t - matrix .",
    "a general term of it may be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 being the unperrurbed hamiltonian .",
    "note that the intermediate states ( represented by 1 in the numerator ) cover the entire space , and @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the model space ( momentum @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 its complement .",
    "expanding it out in terms of @xmath20 and @xmath22 , a typical term of t is of the form @xmath23 .",
    "let us define a @xmath24-box as @xmath25 , where all intermediate states belong to q. one readily sees that the t - matrix can be regrouped as a @xmath24-box series , namely @xmath26\\mid p \\rangle$ ] .",
    "note that all the @xmath24-boxes have the same energy variable , namely @xmath27 .",
    "this regrouping is depicted in fig .",
    "1 , where each @xmath24-box is denoted by a circle and the solid line represents the propagator @xmath28 . the diagrams a , b and c are respectively the one- and two- and three-@xmath24-box terms of t , and clearly t = a+b+c+@xmath29 .",
    "note the dashed vertical line is not a propagator ; it is just a `` ghost '' line to indicate the external indices .",
    "we now perform a folded - diagram factorization for the t - matrix , following closely the klr folded - diagram method @xcite .",
    "diagram b of fig .",
    "1 is factorized into the product of two parts ( see b1 ) where the time integrations of the two parts are independent from each other , each integrating from @xmath30 to 0 . in this way",
    "we have introduced a time - incorrect contribution which must be corrected .",
    "in other words b is not equal to b1 , rather it is equal to b1 plus the folded - diagram correction b2 .",
    "note that the integral sign represents a generalized folding @xcite .",
    "similarly we factorize the three-@xmath24-box term c as shown in the third line of fig .",
    "higher - order @xmath24-box terms are also factorized following the same folded - diagram procedure .",
    "let us now collecting terms in the figure in a `` slanted '' way .",
    "the sum of terms a1 , b2 , c3 ... is just the low - momentum effective interaction of eq.(4 ) .",
    "( note that the leading @xmath24-box of any folded term must be at least second order in @xmath1 , and hence it is denoted as @xmath31-box which equals to @xmath24-box with terms first - order in @xmath1 subtracted . )",
    "the sum b1 , c2 , d3 .... is @xmath32 .",
    "similarly the sum c1+d2+e3+@xmath29 is just @xmath33 .",
    "( note diagrams d1 , d2 , @xmath29 , e1 , e2 , @xmath29 are not shown in the figure . ) continuing this way , it is easy to see that eqs .",
    "( 1 ) to ( 3 ) are satisfied by the low momentum effective interaction of eq.(4 ) .",
    "the effective interaction of eq.(4 ) can be calculated using iteration methods .",
    "a number of such iteration methods have been developed ; the krenciglowa - kuo @xcite and the lee - suzuki iteration methods @xcite are two examples .",
    "these methods were formulated primarily for the case of degenerate @xmath34 , @xmath35 being the unperturbed hamiltonian . for our present two - nucleon problem ,",
    "@xmath34 is obviously non - degenerate .",
    "non - degenerate iteration methods @xcite are more complicated . however ,",
    "a recent iteration method developed by andreozzi @xcite is particularly efficient for the non - degenerate case .",
    "this method shall be referred to as the andreozzi - lee - suzuki ( als ) iteration method , and has been employed in the present work .",
    "we have carried out numerical checks to ensure that certain low - energy physics of @xmath1 are indeed preserved by @xmath0 .",
    "we first check the deuteron binding energy @xmath36 given by @xmath0 . for a range of @xmath5 , such as @xmath37",
    ", @xmath36 given by @xmath0 agrees very accurately ( to 4 places after the decimal ) with that given by @xmath1 . in fig .",
    "2 , we present some @xmath38 phase shifts calculated from the cd - bonn @xmath1 ( dotted line ) and the @xmath0 ( circles ) derived from it , using a momentum cut - off @xmath39 .",
    "as seen , the phase shifts from the former are well reproduced by the latter .",
    "we have also checked the half - on - shell t - matrix given by @xmath1 and by @xmath0 , and found very good agreement between them @xcite . in short",
    ", our numerical checks have reaffirmed that the deuteron binding energy , low energy phase shifts and low momentum half - on - shell t - matrix of @xmath1 are all preserved by @xmath0 .",
    "as far as those physical quantities are concerned , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are equivalent .",
    "having proven the `` physical equivalence '' of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the sense of the rg , we turn now to microscopic shell model calculations in which we use @xmath0 as the input interaction . we have performed shell - model calculations for @xmath3o and @xmath4te following the same procedure as outlined in refs.@xcite , except that the @xmath2-matrix vertices used there are replaced by our present @xmath0 .",
    "a model space with two valence nucleons in the @xmath40 shell is used for @xmath3o , and a @xmath41 one for @xmath4te . in a concurrent paper @xcite",
    "we have found that @xmath0 is almost independent of the underlying @xmath1 for the values of @xmath5 considered here .",
    "therefore , although the cd - bonn potential @xcite is used in our calculations , we stress that very similar results will be obtained if we calculate @xmath0 from other models such as the paris or argonne v-18 potentials .",
    "our calculated low - lying @xmath42 states of @xmath3o and @xmath4te are presented in fig.3 and fig.4 . in the same figures ,",
    "results of the corresponding g - matrix calculations are also shown ; the @xmath0 results are just as good or slightly better .",
    "it may be mentioned that the g - matrix is energy dependent and pauli blocking dependent , while @xmath0 is not which is a desirable feature .",
    "an important issue is what value one should use for @xmath5 . guided by general eft arguments ,",
    "the minimum value for @xmath5 must be large enough so that @xmath0 explicitly contains the necessary degrees of freedom for the physical system .",
    "such a value for @xmath43 is signalled when the calculated spectra first become insensitive to @xmath5@xcite .",
    "conversely , we want @xmath5 to be smaller than the short distance scale @xmath44 at which the model dependence of the different @xmath1 starts to creep in@xcite .",
    "systems in which these two constraints are consistent with each other ( i.e. , @xmath45 ) are amenable to eft - rg inspired effective theories , as they possess a clear separation of scales between the relevant long wavelength modes and the model dependent short distance structure .",
    "we have found @xcite that @xmath44 should not be much greater than 2.0 - 2.5 @xmath46 as this is the scale at which @xmath0 first becomes dependent on the particular @xmath1 used .",
    "there is another consideration : most nn potentials are constructed to fit empirical phase shifts up to @xmath47 mev @xcite . since @xmath48 ,",
    "m being the nucleon mass , and one should require @xmath0 to reproduce the same empirical phase shifts , a choice of @xmath5 in the vicinity of 2 @xmath6 would seem to be appropriate .    guided by the above considerations , we have used in our calculation two values for the momentum cut - off , namely @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "it is satisfying to see that the results in fig . 3 and fig .",
    "4 are rather insensitive to the choice of @xmath5 ; this suggests that @xmath51 is around 2@xmath6 in harmony with the eft philosophy mentioned earlier .",
    "perhaps more importantly , both are in satisfactory agreement with experiments .",
    "note that all energies are relative to the ground state energy of the respective core nucleus .",
    "we emphasize that we have used _ the same _",
    "@xmath0 interaction in both @xmath3o and @xmath4te calculations , and it appears to work equally well for both nuclei .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the traditional approach in which one uses @xmath2-matrices , as the pauli blocking operator is very different for the two nuclear mass regions .",
    "this is an exciting result , as it suggests the possibility for a common shell - model interaction that is nearly model independent and suitable for a wide range of nuclei .    in summary",
    ", we have investigated a rg - eft inspired approach to shell model calculations that is a `` first step '' towards a model independent calculation that uses one common interaction over a wide range of nuclei . using",
    "the klr folded diagram approach in conjunction with the als iteration method , we have performed a rg decimation where the model dependent pieces of @xmath1 models are integrated out to obtain a nearly unique low momentum potential @xmath0 .",
    "this @xmath0 preserves the deuteron pole as well as the low energy phase shifts and half - on - shell @xmath8 matrix .",
    "we have used @xmath0 , which is a smooth potential , directly in shell model calculations of @xmath3o and @xmath4te without first calculating the @xmath2 matrix .",
    "the results are in satisfactory agreement with experiment for both nuclei , and they are insensitive to @xmath5 in the neighborhood of @xmath52 . for completeness , we add that satisfactory results have also been obtained using the same @xmath0 in shell model calculations in the @xmath53pb and @xmath54sn regions .",
    "calculations of spin orbit splittings using the same @xmath0 have also led to satifactory results .",
    "these results are a work in progress and will be reported in a subsequent paper .",
    "we do feel that @xmath0 may become a promising and reliable effective interaction for shell model calculations of few valence nucleons , over a wide range of nuclear regions .",
