    "obtaining such a massless spectrum theoretically has a long history under the name of the ` gauge hierarchy problem ' @xcite . since quarks and leptons have the chiral structure , they can be kept massless down to the tev scale .",
    "however , the higgs boson is difficult to be kept massless in the sm framework .",
    "the most studied solution of the gauge hierarchy problem has been supersymmetry(susy ) . even in the minimally supersymmetrized sm ( mssm )",
    ", there is a problem known as the ` @xmath3 problem ' @xcite .",
    "the mssm @xmath3 term , @xmath4 , is required to be at the electroweak scale , and the difficulty obtaining it at the tev scale is the problem .",
    "recently , the permutation discrete symmetry @xmath5 has been used to obtain a massless pair of higgs doublets , @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "using a discrete symmetry to obtain the @xmath3 term is welcome in view of the gravity effects violating some ad hoc symmetries except the gauge symmetry @xcite .",
    "indeed , it was argued in @xcite that the peccei - quinn(pq ) global symmetry @xcite broken at the intermediate scale has a severe fine tuning problem due to the gravity violation of the global symmetry .",
    "if we consider a global symmetry , it must be an approximate symmetry .",
    "discrete symmetries can not escape this gravity conundrum , but if it is a discrete subgroup of a gauge symmetry or dictated by string theory then it is safe from the gravity conundrum .",
    "if the exact discrete symmetries are known , they can be helpful in obtaining an approximate global symmetry .",
    "therefore , theoretical consideration of a global symmetry proceeds as follows :    * firstly , at the energy scale much below @xmath8 , a global symmetry respected by the @xmath9 superpotential terms can be considered .",
    "since it is an approximate symmetry , it must be violated by higher order terms beyond @xmath10 suppressed by the planck scale or the gut scale masses . *",
    "second , the global symmetry in consideration from @xmath9 superpotential terms must be a part of a discrete symmetry respected by gravity so that the @xmath9 superpotential terms are not affected by the wormhole effects . *",
    "third , for a specific global symmetry definition , all the superpotential terms up to @xmath11 may be needed for a unique definition .",
    "the second and third steps are strong conditions .",
    "this idea was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and here we realize the scheme explicitly . the regions for the discrete and global symmetries are shown in fig . 2 of @xcite . also , there is a common region which defines the approximate global symmetry from the discrete symmetry origin .",
    "if we consider the sm gauge group below the gut scale , the rank of gauge symmetries we can count on are limited in the ultraviolet completed theory .",
    "therefore , if there are too many singlets needed for the concrete definition of the global symmetry , the global symmetry may not be allowed from the ultraviolet completed theory . in ref .",
    "@xcite , by obtaining a tev scale @xmath3 the approximate pq symmetry toward a strong cp solution was obtained .",
    "the most curious cosmological observation is the extremely small dark endrgy(de ) of order @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the simplest form of de is the so - called cosmological constant(cc ) .",
    "the cc appears as a real constant in the einstein equation @xcite and behaves as energy . on the other hand ,",
    "if time - dependent homogeneous energy density evolves very slowly and stays almost constant during our observable time scale , it is called de .",
    "so , de includes the cc . at present , it is fair to say that the cc problem is not understood @xcite . as in any attempts to derive a small de scale @xcite , here we assume that the cc is zero .",
    "the anthropic bound @xcite is not a calculational scheme .    .",
    "at the point the thick arrow directs to , all equations of motion are satisfied and the cc is vanishing . ]    the almost flat green - colored cartoon potential of fig .",
    "[ fig : inflation ] is assumed to be that of a quintessential pseudoscalar field @xmath13 contributing to de .",

    "the pseudoscalar we consider in this paper is assumed not to couple to a non - abelian anomaly .",
    "since the terminology ` axion ' is too much connected to the anomaly , in this paper we prefer to use the name ` @xmath14eudo@xmath15calar boson'(deps ) which does not couple to the qcd ( and hidden - sector if present ) non - abelian anomalies .",
    "the corresponding approximate global symmetry is denoted as u(1)@xmath16 .",
    "the easiest way to introduce the deps scale is just assuming a spontaneously broken u(1)@xmath16   potential whose height is about @xmath17@xmath18   above the theoretically favored cc value of 0 .",
    "approaching to the current de scale . ]",
    "but then we go back to an extreme fine tuning problem .",
    "so , we propose to use suitable discrete symmetries toward obtaining our desired approximate global symmetry u(1)@xmath16 . even before the 1998 discovery of the accelerating universe ,",
    "discrete symmetries were considered for obtaining some approximate global symmetry @xcite .",
    "but with the 1998 discovery , the prospect of discrete symmetries as the basic tool for constructing global symmetries entered into the horizon of physics .",
    "of course , the hypothetical discrete symmetry must satisfy the discrete gauge symmetry rule @xcite .",
    "namely , we try to understand the de scale from two _ observed _ fundamental mass parameters , the planck mass @xmath8 and the tev scale @xmath19 , as envisioned in @xcite .",
    "then , it has been argued that the suppression factor for the non - zero de potential with the intermediate scale of @xmath20 is of order @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "since the gut scale can be considered as the planck scale multiplied by some o(@xmath22 ) parameters , we do not treat it as an independent scale .",
    "the ew scale , @xmath3 and the tev scale are of the same order and we treat them as one scale",
    ". the intermediate mass scale @xmath23 can be expressed as @xmath24 and we do not treat it as an independent scale . indeed , the scale @xmath3 can be related to the intermediate scale in some models @xcite . since the deps   scale is independent of the qcd scale , we will not consider it here .",
    "summarizing , let us introduce the parameters related to the deps   in terms of two scales , @xmath25 with the possibility of some o(1 ) couplings multiplied .",
    "if the deps   potential of @xmath13 is expressed in terms of @xmath19 , @xmath13 must couple to the pairs of higgs doublets @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "if the combination @xmath26 carries a pq charge , @xmath13 must have a pq charge and we must worry about the anomaly u(1)@xmath16su(3)@xmath27 . to remove this anomaly , we introduce another u(1 ) symmetry u(1)@xmath28   so that one of the two linear combinations is free of the qcd anomaly .",
    "namely , the deps   scales ( deps   mass and decay constant ) can not be treated independently from the qcd axion scale .",
    "therefore , it is required to introduce two global u(1 ) symmetries to obtain the u(1)@xmath16   which is free of the u(1)@xmath16su(3)@xmath27 anomaly . as a consequence ,",
    "two classes of singlet fields are introduced , @xmath29-type(@xmath30 and @xmath31 ) for the qcd axion and @xmath32-type(@xmath33 and @xmath34 ) for the deps .",
    "if we introduce another confining force su(@xmath35 , an additional class of singlets will be needed not to introduce u(1)@xmath16su(n)@xmath36 . in susy models ,",
    "the intermediate axion scale @xmath37 @xcite is considered as the confining scale of a hidden gauge group @xcite .",
    "however , here we do not consider an extra nonabelian gauge group for simplicity and also because there may be some method to break susy without the extra nonabelian gauge group .",
    "we attempt to obtain the deps   of mass of order @xmath38 with the decay constant @xmath39 .",
    "the qcd axion has been discussed with the @xmath5 symmetry @xcite .",
    "another discrete symmetry is introduced to house one more approximate global symmetry for the deps , @xmath40 or @xmath41 @xcite . as a specific example , we consider the global symmetry @xmath42 .",
    "the discussion is at the supersymmetric field theory level , even though it is strongly motivated by the orbifold compactification of the heterotic string . in sec .",

    "section [ sec : conclusion ] is a conclusion .",
    "the first step toward understanding the de of the universe is to have a goldstone field @xmath48 where the superscript @xmath49 means the goldstone boson considering the lowest order interactions only .",

    "[ fig : inflation ] so that higher order contributions are feeble enough for the tiny vacuum energy of fig .",
    "[ fig : inflation ] .",
    "so , we attempt to introduce an approximate global symmetry to have the pseudo - goldstone boson . since the global symmetry is approximate , this evades the gravity constraint that gravity does not respect global symmetries by the mother discrete symmetry @xcite .",
    "the mother discrete symmetry is the one respected by gravity @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "the needed global symmetries u(1)@xmath28   and u(1)@xmath16   appear as accidental ones .",
    "the goldstone field is massless at the tree level ( @xmath50 ) , whose vacuum energy scale is depicted at the bottom red line in the second column of fig .",

    "the expected energy scale in the fundamental lagrangian is @xmath51 which is depicted as the upper red band in the second column of fig .",
    "[ fig : massscales ] .",
    "the key point is how to obtain the bottom red line @xmath52 out of the gut or the planck scale energy @xmath51 .",
    "a similar question on the @xmath3 problem of susy has been answered by introducing ` democracy ' for two pairs of higgs doublets @xcite . here",
    ", susy is not a necessary ingredient , but is useful to simplify the couplings .",
    "so , for the ` democracy ' idea , fermions in terms of the left - handed(l ) and the right - handed(r ) fields are introduced @xcite and we adopt susy for this purpose .    for a natural introduction of the de scale , an extreme care is needed since any small correction at the gut scale @xmath1 , at the axion scale @xmath53 , or even at the electroweak scale @xmath19 , can easily outshoot the anticipated height of deps   potential @xmath18 .",
    "let us introduce two chiral singlets @xmath54 and @xmath55 with susy and each with two chiralities : l and r chiralities .",
    "if these two singlets are not distinguished by any quantum number and geometry of the internal space , there must be the permutation symmetries , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the permutation symmetry @xmath58 is the permutation @xmath59 , each for the l and r fields .",
    "the singlets , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the singlet representations of @xmath56 , and the singlets @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( or represented by @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) are the singlet representations of @xmath57 .",
    "then , the lowest order mass matrix @xmath66 of two singlets is @xmath67 where @xmath68 here , @xmath69 is the gut scale .",

    "[ fig : massscales ] .",
    "the mass matrix @xmath66 is diagonalized to @xmath71 and the new bases are related to the old ones by @xmath72 or @xmath73 one may argue that starting with mass matrix ( [ eq : diagmassmatrix ] ) is just postulating two mass eigenvalues from the outset .",
    "it is true but mass matrix ( [ eq : diagmassmatrix ] ) must have an underlying symmetry , which will become transparent by the inverse transformation , _ i.e.  _ transforming eq .",

    "motivated by the string compactification , we are interested in matter which belongs to ( * 248 * , @xmath90 ) and ( @xmath90 , * 248 * ) of e@xmath91e@xmath92 . since *",
