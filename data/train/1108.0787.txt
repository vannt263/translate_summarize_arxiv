    "hypernuclei provide an unique opportunity to investigate the dynamics of the full meson and baryon su(3 ) flavor octet .",
    "they are an excellent tool to extract information on the hyperon - nucleon interaction . for a complete understanding of the baryon - baryon interactions in terms of the meson - exchange or quark - gluon pictures ,",
    "the basic experimental data are required also on the hyperon - nucleon interaction together with the nucleon - nucleon interaction . yet ,",
    "relatively little is understood about nuclei that contain one or more hyperons .",
    "it is possible that the study of hypernuclei may help in unraveling fundamental issues regarding the ordinary nuclei in terms of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) which is the theory of strongly interacting particles .    since @xmath0 is the lightest among the hyperons ( @xmath2 = 1.115 gev ) , the @xmath0 hypernuclei are the most investigated systems so far  @xcite . through a series of experimental studies involving @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 reactions ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review of the experimental scenario ) the @xmath0 shell structure has been mapped out over a wide range of the periodic table .",
    "systematic studies of the energy levels of light @xmath0 hypernuclei have enabled the extraction of considerable amount of details about the @xmath0n interaction .",
    "it is established that the spin - orbit part of this force is weaker ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and the related references cite there ) than that of the @xmath7 system .",
    "this has also been useful in developing the theoretical models of the hypernuclear production reactions where the quantum numbers and the binding energies of @xmath0 single particle states are vital inputs  @xcite .    for several reasons",
    "it is necessary to have information about the behavior of a hyperon in nuclear medium which can be provided by the heavier @xmath0 hypernuclei .",
    "the basic quantities like @xmath0 effective mass and the depth of the @xmath0 potential in nuclei can be obtained by investigating the @xmath0 binding energies in a wide range of heavier systems .",
    "these quantities are the important basic parameters for a realistic discussion of neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "the information on the @xmath0 spin - orbit splitting in heavier hypernuclei is of interest because it may have contributions from the higher order many body effects in addition to the @xmath1 two - body spin - dependent interaction .",
    "it is therefore , important to develop reliable theoretical tools to investigate the spectroscopy of the hypernuclei . from qcd point of view hypernuclei",
    "lie in the non - perturbative low momentum regime .",
    "therefore , lattice qcd calculations should be the ideal tool for investigating their structure .",
    "indeed , first step in this direction has already been initiated where the scattering length and the effective range for @xmath1 scattering have been extracted in both qcd and partially - quenched qcd calculations  @xcite . however , a description of the detailed structure of hypernuclei is still beyond the reach of the lattice qcd and one has to use methods where baryons and mesons are the effective degrees of freedom .",
    "both relativistic and non - relativistic descriptions have been used to investigate the structure of hypernuclei .",
    "the relativistic mean field approach has been employed in refs .",
    "@xcite with meson - hyperon vertices adjusted in varied ways .",
    "the su(3 ) symmetric field theories including chirality  @xcite , and the quark - meson coupling model  @xcite that invokes the quark degrees of freedom have been developed to investigate the structure of hypernuclei . a density dependent relativistic hadron ( ddrh ) field theory was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe @xmath0 hypernuclei . in ref .",
    "@xcite a in - medium chiral su(3 ) dynamics has been used to study the hypernuclear single particle spectra where a very good agreement has been achieved with the corresponding data .",
    "the smallness of the @xmath0-nuclear spin - orbit interaction also finds a natural explanation within this approach .    among the non - relativistic approaches",
    "are the calculations based on the shell model picture  ( see , e.g.,ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "most of them reproduce reasonably well the measured hypernuclear states of medium to heavy hypernuclei using phenomenological @xmath0n potentials of the woods - saxon type  @xcite .",
    "several authors have also developed the semi - empirical mass formulas to describe the binding energy ( be ) of the hypernuclei  @xcite    the skyrme - hartree - fock ( shf ) model , which has been a powerful tool for investigating the properties of nonstrange nuclei  @xcite , was extended to studies of the @xmath0 hypernuclei in refs .",
    "the suitability of this approach for describing the @xmath0 hypernuclei depends heavily on the proper knowledge of the @xmath0n effective interaction , which has either been extracted from the microscopic methods like @xmath8-matrix calculations performed with jlich and nijmegen potentials  @xcite or by fitting directly to the hypernuclear data ( mainly the binding energies )  @xcite .",
    "the reliability of the latter method is related directly to the amount of hypernuclear data used in the fitting process . in previous studies ,",
    "the data used for this purpose were limited to a few light nuclei .",
    "therefore , there is a need to perform shf calculations using the @xmath1 interaction with parameters that are determined by fitting to a larger set of data on binding energies that is available now .    in this paper",
    ", we study the @xmath0 hypernuclei within the framework of the hartree - fock method where the parameters of the skyrme type @xmath0n effective interaction have been determined by fitting to the experimental binding energies of of hypernuclei with baryon numbers ranging over a wide mass range . in one fitting procedure ,",
    "we have included nuclei with masses ranging between 8 to 208 . in two more fittings ,",
    "the nuclei with masses below 16 were omitted .",
    "we have also included a density dependent term in the @xmath1 interaction in our fitting procedure as suggested in ref .",
    "the parameter sets having the minimum @xmath9 values in three searches have been used to calculate the binding energies of about 95 hypernuclear states and the results are compared with the available experimental data .",
    "furthermore , we have also calculated the total binding energy per baryon of 73 @xmath0 hypernuclei , and the root mean square ( rms ) radii of a few nuclei of them .",
    "finally our best fit parameter sets have been used to investigate some properties of neutron stars .",
    "the present paper is organized as following . in section",
    "ii , the skyrme - hartree - fock method as applied to the description of the single @xmath0 hypernuclei , is briefly described and parameters involved in the skyrme type @xmath1 force are discussed . in section iii , we describe the @xmath9 minimization method [ based on the simulated annealing method ( sam ) ] that is used by us to determine the best fit parameters of the @xmath1 interaction . in section iv , we present the results and discussions of the comparison of our calculations for the single particle energies of the @xmath0 states with the available experimental data .",

    "thus , the total energy density functional ( edf ) of a hypernucleus is written as a sum of two basic contributions - @xmath10 , which is the total energy density for neutron and proton @xcite and @xmath11 , which is the contribution due to the presence of the hyperon ( hyperons ) : @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 represent the baryon , kinetic and spin - orbit current densities , respectively ( q = @xmath16 ) .",

    "in summary , we have used an extended skyrme hartree - fock model to describe the properties of the @xmath0 hypernuclei .",

    "the maximum neutron star mass obtained with sets hp@xmath02 , hp@xmath03 and n@xmath01 is about 1.5@xmath119 , while that with the set o@xmath01 is 1.75@xmath119 .",
    "this is the direct consequence of the relatively stiffer eos in this case .",
    "we remark that these results obtained with our best fit @xmath1 effective interactions reproduce quantitatively all the features that have been observed in several different models such as non - relativistic brueckner - hartree - fock and relativistic mean field calculations .",
    "nevertheless , an explanation of some of the recent neutron star observations  @xcite such as pulsar psr j1614 - 2230 with a mass of 1.97@xmath1300.04@xmath119 is still beyond the scope of the present skyrme type of model unless the eos is even stiffer than what has been achieved with the interaction o@xmath01 .",
