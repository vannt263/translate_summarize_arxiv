    ", it is known that nature prefers the incoherent states @xcite , while in josephson junction arrays which are globally coupled , both in - phase and incoherent states may co - exist @xcite .",
    "the stability of the in - phase state in most applications has been important in order to maintain frequency control and/or power output in the arrays , such as in coupled lasers and josephson s junctions .",
    "recently , interacting arrays of limit cycle oscillators possessing different architectures have been proposed to stabilize a high frequency in - phase state @xcite . while numerical simulations exhibit stable in - phase states over a particular range of parameters ,",
    "no analytical work has been done on the system , and the mechanism behind the onset of stable ultraharmonic oscillations has not been explained .",
    "the goal of this paper is to explain the mechanism behind the onset of stable ultraharmonics , obtain analytic results for the critical value of the coupling constant required for this onset , as well as to explore an alternative coupling scheme previously not considered .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , the equations of motion are introduced and solved exactly , in the absence of global coupling between the two arrays . in section iii , the bifurcation value of the global coupling constant above which stable ultra - harmonic oscillations set in is calculated and shown to depend of frequency , amplitude and total number of oscillators . the physical mechanism behind the onset of stable ultra - harmonics",
    "is explained , as resulting from a large constant component in the amplitude - dependent global coupling , that determines the bifurcation value . above the bifurcation value ,",
    "the dynamics of one of the arrays become a function of the other , resulting in ultraharmonics . averaging theory",
    "is applied in section iv to explain the equivalence of the bifurcation diagrams between the averaged and the full system and to estimate the amplitude of ultraharmonic oscillations .",
    "section v derives an alternative type of coupling that while more complicated in form , has the advantage of creating a higher amplitude ultra - harmonic oscillations , with an amplitude that stays fairly constant as the number of oscillators in the array increases .",
    "section vi concludes and summarizes our results .",
    "the internal dynamics of the uncoupled stuart - landau oscillators in normal form is : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a complex variable .",
    "equation ( [ eq : z ] ) can be easily solved by transforming into polar variables , and results in a limit cycle oscillator with frequency equal to @xmath2 and steady - state amplitude of oscillation equal to @xmath3 .",

    "the equations of motion of each oscillator within the arrays is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : z ] ) .",
    "we start by considering two coupled arrays , as initially introduced in @xcite .",
    "the difference between the two arrays is that @xmath7 oscillators possess anti - phase diffusive coupling between oscillators within the array , while the @xmath8 array has in - phase diffusive coupling within the array .",
    "the two arrays are globally coupled to each other .",

    "( [ eq : xr ] ) and ( [ eq : yr ] ) is shown in figure ( [ fig:2 ] ) . in the case of the @xmath7 array oscillators , the diffusive coupling constant of @xmath11 between oscillators within the array leads to an anti - phase solution .",
    "for the @xmath8-array oscillators , where @xmath12 , the in - phase state is the only stable solution . thus in steady - state , all oscillators in the @xmath8-array tend to have the same dynamics , so that the diffusive coupling term in eq .",

    "the @xmath8-array oscillators will all oscillate in - phase in steady - state , which is a direct outcome of the diffusive coupling term , @xmath12 , so that the in - phase state is the only stable state .",

    "if this amplitude is approximately conserved , then the main contribution from the global coupling term will be a constant component . in section",
    "v , an alternative coupling scheme that results in a higher oscillatory component in the global coupling , leading to higher intensity ultraharmonics , will be considered .      in the absence of inter - array couping , @xmath15",
    ", an exact steady - state solution can be obtained for the two arrays . since in steady - state ,",
    "all the @xmath8-array oscillators move in - phase , the diffusive coupling term drops out of the eq . ( [ eq : yr ] ) , and the solution reduces to that of a single limit cycle oscillator , so that the index @xmath6 on the @xmath8 array will be dropped throughout the rest of the paper . unlike the @xmath8 array oscillators ,",
    "the diffusive coupling term in the @xmath7 array is negative , so that the oscillators tend to be maximally out - of - phase with their nearest neighbors . for a ring of diffusively",

    "the frequency of @xmath7 array oscillators is the same as in the @xmath8 array , the limit cycle frequency , @xmath2 . for @xmath27 however , since @xmath11 , the amplitude of oscillation is higher than that of the in - phase @xmath8-array , which oscillates at amplitude @xmath28 . as will be shown in the following section ,",
    "this difference in amplitude is important to the creation of the stable ultraharmonics and affects the range of the global coupling constant necessary for stable ultraharmonics , in the case of symmetric coupling .    from eqs .",

    "the reason why this @xmath31 distribution of phases is needed for the creation of ultraharmonics at frequency @xmath33 will be explained in the following section .",
    "other types of inter - array coupling schemes could be considered that would result in a different phase distribution .",
    "it was shown in the previous section that in the absence of global coupling , @xmath34 , the steady state dynamics of the two arrays are that of a simple harmonic oscillator , with amplitudes given by @xmath28 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : ampodd ] ) , for the @xmath8 and @xmath7 arrays , respectively .",
    "since the global coupling term is a function of amplitude only ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : xr ] ) and ( [ eq : yr ] ) ) , we would expect the global coupling to introduce a constant component into eqs .",
    "( [ eq : xr ] ) and ( [ eq : yr ] ) .",
    "in fact , if the coupling is one - way , that is if we set @xmath24 , then the global coupling term only contributes a constant component and no ultraharmonics can occur in the @xmath8 array .",
    "this explains the previously made observation @xcite that mutual coupling between the two arrays is required to induce ultraharmonic oscillations .",
    "it follows that the global coupling term in the @xmath7 array must create a perturbation in the amplitude of the @xmath7 oscillators , so that it is no longer a conserved quantity . to understand how this happens",

    "equations of the form ( [ eq : xrc ] ) and ( [ eq : yrc ] ) have been studied previously in connection with forced van der pohl oscillators @xcite .",
    "the main characteristic of these equations is that they execute a limit cycle below a certain critical value of the constants , @xmath39 , @xmath40 . above the critical bifurcation value ,",
    "the oscillations are damped out , so that the system reaches a stable equilibrium ( a sink ) .",

    "( [ eq : xrc ] ) , breaks the symmetry about the origin , making the amplitude of oscillation dependent on the phase of the oscillator . in phase - space",

    "now , all of the oscillators in the @xmath7 array have amplitudes which oscillate at the frequency of the limit cycle , @xmath2 .",

    "this can be better explained using averaging theory that applies when the system , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : yrc ] ) is close to steady - state ( when @xmath46 ) and will be explored in the following section",

    "we are now in a position to give an explanation of the mechanism behind the onset of ultraharmonic oscillations in the @xmath8 array .",
    "as the symmetric global coupling constant , @xmath43 , increases , a critical bifurcation value is reached in the constant component of the global coupling , whereby the @xmath8 array undergoes a bifurcation into a sink region of the phase - space , while the @xmath7 array is still executing a limit cycle oscillation .",
    "after undergoing a bifurcation , the @xmath8 array oscillators are driven by the oscillatory ultraharmonic component of the coupling from the @xmath7-array and execute ultraharmonic oscillations about a steady state , which is determined by the constant component , @xmath40 .    the constant component , @xmath40 , of the coupling term @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the average amplitude of the @xmath7 array .",

    "thus the drive has many advantages , such as a relatively high , easily controllable amplitude that does not degrade with an increase in @xmath16 and does not suffer from oscillator death , which occurs in mutually coupled arrays .",
    "however , since @xmath111 increases as @xmath150 , high ultraharmonics , @xmath33 , require rather high powers in the coupling function .",
    "the mechanism behind the generation of ultra - harmonic oscillations in two mutually coupled arrays of limit cycle oscillators was analyzed .",
    "these ultra - harmonic oscillations were shown to occur as a result of a bifurcation that results when the coupling from the @xmath7 to the @xmath8 array exceeds a certain value .",
    "this coupling consists of a large constant component , since the coupling is amplitude - dependent , and a smaller ultraharmonic oscillatory component that results from the breaking of symmetry in the @xmath7-array due to coupling from the @xmath8-array .",
    "this smaller oscillatory component of the coupling induces the @xmath8 array to oscillate at an ultra - harmonic frequency around the equilibrium determined by the large constant component of the coupling .",
    "it was also shown that in the case of amplitude - dependent coupling , the ultra - harmonic oscillation is the result of a mutual interaction between the two arrays ( rather than a master - slave system ) , since the coupling from the @xmath8 to the @xmath7 array is necessary to induce an oscillation in the otherwise conserved amplitude of @xmath7 oscillators .",
    "the range of inter - array coupling constants whereby ultra - harmonic oscillations are produced was derived for symmetric @xmath43 coupling , but can be generalized to non - symmetric coupling , where @xmath151 . for symmetric coupling , this range depends on the limit cycle frequency , the amplitude of oscillation and the strength of nearest - neighbor coupling within the @xmath7 array .",
    "the allowable range of inter - array coupling constant increases with an increase in strength of the diffusive coupling , @xmath60 , in the out - of - phase coupled @xmath7 array .",
    "thus higher absolute values of @xmath60 lead to a greater possible range of values of the inter - array coupling constant whereby ultra - harmonic oscillations are created .",
    "the @xmath8 array diffusive coupling strength , @xmath152 , on the other hand , does not affect the conditions for creation of stable ultraharmonics , since the diffusive coupling term drops out in steady - state for in - phase coupled arrays .",
    "the derived bifurcation values for the inter - array coupling constant agree well with numerical simulation , and can be used to tune the value of the coupling constant to control the amplitude of the ultra - harmonic oscillations .    for achieving better - controlled , higher amplitude ultra - harmonic oscillations , another form of coupling was suggested .",
    "this one - way coupling has the advantage of achieving higher amplitude ultra - harmonic oscillations that do not fall in amplitude as the number of oscillators , and therefore the ultra - harmonic frequency , increases .",
    "it also does not suffer from oscillator death , which puts an upper limit on the strength of symmetric coupling that can be used in amplitude coupled arrays .",
    "the suggested form of coupling , however , requires increasingly more complicated forms of the coupling function as @xmath16 increases and may be more difficult to implement experimentally .    finally ,",
    "though the methods of analysis here were applied to oscillator of stuart - landau type , they may be applied to various applications of interest , where both frequency and power control are required .",
    "such examples of the stabilization of in - phase arrays occur in such areas as electronic circuits for radar @xcite , phase locked nano - scale magnets used for microwave sources @xcite , power systems @xcite , and josephson junction arrays used for terahertz sources @xcite .",
    "this work was supported by a grant from the office of naval research .",
