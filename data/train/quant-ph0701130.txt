    "recent experiments with lattice fermions across feshbach resonance have raised significant hope for the application of atomic quantum gases to implementations of quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "these experiments usually begin with the preparation of two fermions into each optical lattice site . making use of a feshbach resonance @xcite",
    ", the two - atom scattering length is tuned from a small positive value to the attractive side by varying an external magnetic field . during this process",
    ", the motional states of the fermionic atom pair in each lattice site can occupy different bloch bands , exhibiting new features that need further theoretical explanation @xcite .    in quantum information science , quantum entanglement is viewed as the enabling resource for its potential power over classical information processing , as in quantum teleportation @xcite and cryptography @xcite . in this paper , we present a thorough investigation of the pair entanglement of two fermions in a single optical lattice site , approximated as a cylindrical harmonic trap .",
    "similar studies have been carried out in a one dimensional harmonic trap @xcite and in a three dimensional spherical harmonic trap @xcite .",
    "the present study differs in two significant aspects : first , we extend earlier studies to the case of three dimensional cylindrical harmonic traps ; second , we allow for the possibility that the two interacting atoms may form a molecular bound state , albeit in the broad resonance regime . in the model to be presented below",
    "we will parameterize the two atom interaction using a general formalism commonly adopted in the many body system of bcs to bec crossover @xcite . for a broad feshbach resonance , where most of the currently employed resonance theories do fall into ,",
    "the earlier results based on a single channel model are easily recovered by excluding the molecular component .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we present the model system and our formulation , essentially parallel to the development and notations of ref .",
    "next , we focus on the broad resonance regime and briefly discuss the molecular component .",
    "this paves the way for the discussion of our central result  a thorough investigation of the pair entanglement and its dependence on trap strength and geometry , and on atom - atom interaction strength .",
    "finally , we conclude with a brief summary .",
    "following the successful model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , two fermions are assumed to be located in the same lattice site , which for this study is approximated as a harmonic trap .",
    "each optical lattice site represents an independent system , since the quantum tunnelling , or hopping between neighboring sites , is negligible for deep optical lattice potential of interest .",
    "the hamiltonian for the system of two spin-@xmath0 fermionic atoms is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the harmonic oscillator energy for state labelled by @xmath3 with angular frequencies @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 is the creation operator for a fermionic atom in the open channel with energy @xmath6 and spin @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 is the creation operator for the two - atom bound state , a bosonic molecule in the closed channel with its center of mass wave function fixed exactly at the harmonic ground state , a result of the simple approximation that the optical lattice trap potential for the bound state molecule is simply equal to the sum of the trap potentials of the two atoms .",
    "@xmath9 is the energy difference between the closed channel bosonic molecule and the two fermions in the open channel .",
    "@xmath10 is the coherent coupling element converting two open channel fermions into a closed channel bosonic molecule , which is defined to contain a common constant prefactor @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath12 with @xmath13 being the harmonic orbital of a single atom .",
    "the relative motional part of the molecular ground state , @xmath14 , will be approximated as a contact @xmath15 function , since it is typically of atomic size @xcite , much less than other length scales in this problem .",
    "such a simplification contains an ultra - violet divergence that can be removed by a suitable momentum cutoff with a renormalized detuning @xcite .",
    "an alternative formulation involves the use of the regularized delta function @xcite .",
    "the cylindrical harmonic trap is characterized by the trap frequencies @xmath16 with @xmath17 parameterizing the trap aspect ratio . within this model ,",
    "the two fermionic atoms in the open channel ( of being atoms ) at bands @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be converted into a closed channel bosonic molecule , or vice versa .",
    "the eigenstate of hamiltonian ( [ hm ] ) can be expressed as @xmath20 again following ref .",
    "the various coefficients are determined from the following coupled equations @xmath21 as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the divergence in eq .",
    "( [ eeq ] ) can be removed by introducing a cutoff in the summation .",
    "such a procedure will renormalize @xmath9 to @xmath22 . by comparing the free space expression of the energy @xmath23 ( renormalized ) to the results of resonance scattering at low energies , the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath11",
    "are then matched to the experimentally relevant parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath24 is the @xmath26-wave scattering length between fermionic atoms in different internal states and @xmath25 is the effective range .",
    "the result is @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the mass of the atom .",
    "a dimensionless parameter @xmath29 is then introduced , with which the energy quantization condition becomes @xmath30 = - { \\lambda\\over \\sqrt{\\pi } } f\\left(-{x\\over \\lambda},{1\\over \\lambda}\\right)\\label{qzc},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 , and the function on the right hand side of eq .",

    "@xcite , we now extend the earlier result @xcite to a cylindrical harmonic trap . to begin with , we first approximate the two fermion wave function ( [ 2w ] ) by neglecting the small molecular component , thus we obtain @xmath53 with the normalization constraint @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55 are assumed real and symmetric for two identical atoms with @xmath56 . in the single atom basis state ,",
    "the above wave function becomes @xmath57 , and the total entropy becomes @xmath58 @xcite . while nontrivial , the spatial part of entanglement @xmath59 ( abbreviated as pair entanglement ) can be computed from the schmidt decomposition @xcite of the spatial wave function , i.e. , we need to find @xmath60 with the schmidt mode functions @xmath61 , because @xmath55 is symmetric . from this ,",
    "the von neumann entropy is found to be @xmath62 .",
    "computing the direct schmidt decomposition for the three dimensional wave function turns out to be a quite demanding numerical task .",
    "fortunately we can simplify this problem effectively to several one dimensional schmidt decompositions , which will be discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "for the two adiabatic states @xmath45a - d - b@xmath46 and @xmath45b - f - c@xmath46 , we have numerically evaluated their spatial pair entanglement .",

    "in summary , we have studied pair entanglement between two spin-@xmath0 fermionic atoms inside a single optical lattice site approximated by a cylindrical harmonic trap .",
    "we investigated thoroughly the dependence of pair entanglement on the trap strength and geometry and on atom - atom interaction strength along the complete bcs to bec crossover and focused on the broad resonance regime .",
    "we developed a formalism for studying pair entanglement including the effect of an effective range @xmath25 for two interacting atoms at low energy .",
    "in the limit of a broad feshbach resonance , where the effect of @xmath25 becomes negligibly small , our result reduces to the theory developed before for evaluating pair entanglement in a single open channel of two atoms without the presence of a bound molecule state .",
    "we find that pair entanglement changes significantly against atomic pair interaction because of the induced motional orbital deformations .",
    "in general , however , the exact value of the spatial pair entanglement is also governed by the motional state degeneracies . as a rule of thumb , we find that spherical harmonic traps generally give rise to larger pair entanglement .",
