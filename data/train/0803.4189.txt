    "ultra - cold atoms obeying ultra - relativistic dynamics would be a match made in heaven .",
    "an atomic cloud cooled down to nano - kelvin temperatures offers an unprecedented opportunity to study and manipulate a true quantum gas .",
    "relativistic dynamics , on the other hand , seems at first sight incompatible with the concept of an ultra - cold quantum gas .",
    "this is not necessarily the case .",
    "it has been noted in earlier works on atomic gases @xcite , but also in layers of graphene @xcite , that it is indeed possible to study relativistic dynamics for systems which are inherently non - relativistic .",
    "counter - intuitively this is the case in the low - momentum limit .",
    "already in the early days of quantum mechanics the dynamics of relativistic particles attracted a lot of attention .",
    "it was soon realised that a number of counter - intuitive results would follow in the relativistic limit , such as the zitterbewegung , i.e. , the trembling motion of the centre of mass of a wave packet .",
    "zitterbewegung has attracted a lot of interest over the years and is continuing to be an active field of research which involves a broad range of physical systems @xcite .",
    "the notion of zitterbewegung itself has its roots in the work of schrdinger on the motion of the free particle based on dirac s relativistic generalization of a wave equation for spin-1/2 particles @xcite . from these early days on the existence of the zitterbewegung for relativistic particles",
    "has also been the subject of some controversy @xcite .    zitterbewegung results from the interefence of the positive and negative energy solutions of the free dirac equation .",
    "the frequency of this interference process is determined by the energy gap between the two possible solution manifolds . in case of",
    "the historically first discussed motion of a free electron wave packet this energy gap is on the order of twice the rest energy @xmath0 of the electron , _",
    "i.e. _ , the energy necessary to create an electron - hole pair . for a complete description",
    "the concepts of quantum field theory , _",
    "i.e. _ , particle creation and annihilation , have to be introduced .",
    "if the zitterbewegung is driven by a process which corresponds to an energy of the order of the rest mass , then this unfortunately also makes it rather unlikely to observe the trembling motion with real electrons @xcite .    a number of physical systems ,",
    "can , however , be described by an effective dirac equation . for these systems the creation energy of all participating real particles is much larger than the gap energy and thus the processes of particle creation and annihilation can be disregarded . moreover ,",
    "the considered _",
    "particles _ are not real but of a _ quasi - particle _ nature , e.g. spin - states . the combination of these features allow us to study the phenomenon of zitterbewegung in regimes far away from its initial discovery  the motion of a free electron .    in this paper we will study the trembling centre of mass motion of a two - level system which is subject to an off - diagonal matrix gauge potential . in the limit of low momenta and",
    "strong gauge fields the dynamics is well described by a dirac - type equation . in recent papers @xcite it has been shown how atoms with an internal tripod level structure , see fig .",
    "[ fig_exp ] , may evolve under the influence of an effective non - abelian vector potential . here",
    "we restrict the motion to only one direction ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a two - dimensional description of zitterbewegung ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section we will briefly outline the derivation of the gauge potentials for the spin system . as an example of the resulting dynamics in the presence of non trivial gauge potentials we study the zitterbewegung for neutral atoms .",
    "finally we discuss the phenomenon of rabi - type oscillations occurring in this context and the damping mechanisms due to finite size effects .",
    "in the following we will assume the motion of the atoms to be restricted to one dimension .",
    "we choose our coordinate system such that the x - axis is aligned along that particular dimension .",
    "a gas of ultracold atoms can be considered dynamically one - dimensional if the corresponding transversal energy scale given by the transversal trapping frequency is much higher than all other energy scales , such as the temperature or chemical potential in the presence of collisional interactions .    to the effectively one - dimensional cloud of cold atoms",
    "we apply the scheme for inducing non - abelian gauge potentials as presented in @xcite , and obtain in the limit of low momenta a _ quasi - relativistic _ situation as shown in @xcite . for this purpose , we consider the adiabatic motion of atoms in the presence of three laser beams .",
    "the technique is remarkably versatile and offers the possibility to shape the gauge potentials quite freely .",
    "various possibilities exist for creating non - trivial equations of motions @xcite . here",
    "we have chosen a laser configuration where two of the beams have the same intensity but counter - propagate .",
    "the third laser beam has a different intensity compared to the two other laser beams .",

    "we find that the interaction hamiltonian after the dipole - approximation and in the interaction picture is given by @xmath9 in the case of resonant laser fields .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath10 yields two dark states @xmath11 , @xmath12 , which contain no contribution from the excited state @xmath13 : @xmath14 both dark states are eigenstates of @xmath10 with zero eigenenergy .",

    "the situation is typically more complicated due to the finite size of the atomic wave packet .",
    "the atomic centre of mass motion is strictly speaking always governed by the schrdinger equation ( [ eq schroedinger equation effectiv1 ] ) , and only in the limit of small momenta compared to the corresponding momentum from the effective gauge potential , are we allowed to construct a dirac type equation .",
    "this , however , would also require us to only use wave packets with zero momentum spread . in the following we will analyse the role of the finite width of the wave packets .",
    "the exact solution of the schrdinger equation ( [ eq schroedinger equation effectiv1 ] ) with the gauge potentials from equation ( [ eq def a])-([eq def v1 ] ) , can readily be written down in momentum space , @xmath81 where now the dimensionless @xmath82 is expressed in units of @xmath83 and the time @xmath84 in units of @xmath85 .",

    "the resulting populations of the two dark states are then given by @xmath93 , can easily be calculated in the limit @xmath94 . in this limit",
    "the gaussian initial state turns into a representation of the delta function , @xmath95 from this result we see the importance of the initial momentum @xmath77 . for @xmath96 there is no transfer of population between the dark states , whereas for a nonzero initial momentum the amplitude of the population oscillation is proportional to @xmath77 .",
    "in addition , the frequency @xmath97 is @xmath77 dependent as well .",
    "the expectation value for the centre of mass can be calculated from @xmath98 from the first term under the integral sign we obtain a drift term for the centre of mass , @xmath99,\\ ] ] where @xmath100 is the complementary error function . in the limit of @xmath101 , and using the asymptotic expansion of the error function , @xmath102 we obtain a reduced drift as a function of _ increasing _ @xmath103 .",
    "this is a finite size effect and stems from the finite width of the wave packet .    the second term under the integral in ( [ integral - exact - k ] ) stands for the zitterbewegung .",
    "again , in the limit @xmath104 , the integral can be readily calculated and gives for the oscillating part @xmath105 from this expression we see that a spread in the momentum distribution will cause a damping also for the oscillating term of the centre of mass .",
    "the damping of the zitterbewegung is relatively slow , but is inevitable .",
    "the underlying equation is after all the schrdinger equation , and only in the limit @xmath94 can we strictly speaking use a dirac - type equation which results in no expansion of the wave packet , hence no damping . with the full schrdinger equation",
    "a free wave packet will always expand , albeit slowly if @xmath86 is small , and hence will also show a damped zitterbewegung .    for a typical alkali atom such as @xmath106rb with a wave packet width of @xmath107 one would get @xmath108 for times larger than @xmath109 , with a centre of mass oscillation frequency of the order of @xmath110 .",
    "hence a broad wave packet as initial state would favour the detection of the zitterbewegung .",
    "in this paper we have showed using ultra - cold atoms how zitterbewegung , known from relativistic physics , is a generic phenomena which will naturally occur in systems with degenerate eigenstates .",
    "interestingly , the atomic scenario offers a number of new possibilities .",
    "we are now in a position to for instance study a system which would correspond to a confined dirac particle by introducing external atomic potentials , either by optical or magnetical means , for the atoms .",
    "this consequently leads us to ponder whether the present system will show bose - einstein condensation , and , if so , what will such a quantum state look like @xcite . in this context interactions between the atoms will play an important role , where one would be faced with a nonlinear dirac - type equation to describe the dynamics .",
    "the source of the nonlinearity is however nontrivial due to the underlying collisions between the two dark states ."
