    "there are two - types of insulators : one is a band insulator and the other is a mott insulator . in the band insulator ,",
    "the charge gap is controlled by the energy separation of the valence and conduction bands .",
    "control of the gap magnitude as well as the momentum dependence of the band dispersions is crucial for the development of semiconductor devices . on the other hand ,",
    "the charge gap in the mott insulator is a consequence of strong electron correlation .",
    "two bands separated by the gap are called the lower hubbard band ( lhb ) and upper hubbard band ( uhb )",
    ". the nature of the momentum dependence of the two bands will also be important for the application of the mott insulator to future devices .    insulating cuprates are a good example of the mott insulator .",
    "the dispersion of the lhb ( more precisely the zhang - rice band ) has been examined by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) and a plenty of information has been accumulated . on the contrary , the dispersion and spectral properties of the uhb",
    "have not directly been observed so far . in the last five years",

    "however , in order to obtain the information of the uhb , the experimental data themselves are not enough due to a particle - hole nature in rixs , so that theoretical contribution and analysis are necessary .    in this paper",
    ", we theoretically examine the momentum dependence of the cu - k edge rixs spectrum based on the single - band hubbard model  @xcite . in 1d insulating cuprates ,",
    "the rixs spectrum dominantly reflects the particle - hole excitation across a direct mott gap , for which only the charge degree of freedom contributes because of the spin - charge separation . in 2d insulating cuprates at half filling , there appears an anisotropic momentum dependence along the @xmath1 and @xmath2 directions .",
    "this is explained by the dispersion of the uhb that has the minimum energy at @xmath2 and by a coherence effect due to antiferromagnetic ( af ) order . upon hole doping into the 2d insulating cuprates",
    ", the mott gap excitation becomes broad and less momentum dependent .",
    "this is in contrast to the electron - doped case , where the momentum dependence of the spectrum of undoped system remains .",
    "such a contrasting behavior is originated from the difference of af correlation in both dopings .",

    "in addition , when the core - hole is screened by the 3@xmath22 electrons through the strong 1@xmath21 - 3@xmath22 interaction , effective charge that acts on the 4@xmath26 electron at the core - hole site becomes small .",
    "therefore , the interactions related to the 4@xmath26 electron are neglected for simplicity .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the photo - excited 4@xmath26 electron enters into the bottom of the 4@xmath26 band with momentum @xmath27 .",

    "<S> we theoretically examine the momentum dependence of resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) spectrum for one - dimensional and two - dimensional cuprates based on the single - band hubbard model with realistic parameter values . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum is calculated by using the numerical diagonalization technique for finite - size clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on excitations across the mott gap and clarify spectral features coming from the excitations as well as the physics behind them . </S>",
    "<S> good agreement between the theoretical and existing experimental results clearly demonstrates that the rixs is a potential tool to study the momentum - dependent charge excitations in strongly correlated electron systems . </S>"
