    "the implementation of ferromagnetism in iii - v semiconductors by incorporating high concentrations of magnetic elements into the group - iii sublattice has opened the prospect of extending conventional semiconductor technology to magnetic applications.@xcite a prominent example , which is presently intensely studied , is the diluted ferromagnetic semiconductor ( ga , mn)as . even though the curie temperatures reported",
    "so far are well below room temperature , it represents a potential candidate or at least an ideal test system for spintronic applications due to its compatibility with the standard semiconductor gaas . during the last decade , considerable progress has been made in understanding the basic structural , electronic , and magnetic properties of ( ga , mn)as.@xcite longitudinal anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr)@xcite and transverse amr , often called planar hall effect ( phe),@xcite anomalous hall effect ( ahe),@xcite and magnetic anisotropy ( ma)@xcite have been established as characteristic features , making ( ga , mn)as potentially suitable for field - sensitive devices and non - volatile memories.@xcite great effort has been made to understand the microscopic mechanisms behind the observed magnetic phenomena and to obtain , theoretically and experimentally , values for the corresponding physical parameters .",
    "in particular , the storage and processing of information by manipulating the magnetization as well as the readout via electrical signals demand a precise knowledge of the parameters controlling the ma and the amr .",
    "it has been shown that both the ma and the amr are affected by temperature , hole density , and strain.@xcite for example , changing the strain from compressive to tensile , the surface normal which usually represents a magnetic hard axis in compressively strained ( ga , mn)as layers turns into an easy axis in tensile - strained layers.@xcite    as demonstrated in ref .  , angle - dependent magnetotransport measurements , performed at different strengths of an external magnetic field , are a genuine alternative to ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) spectroscopy@xcite for probing the ma in ( ga , mn)as .",
    "the application of this method , however , requires analytical expressions for the longitudinal and transverse resistivities @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , correctly describing the amr and the ahe . based on symmetry considerations , such expressions can be derived in a phenomenological way by writing the resistivity tensor as a series expansion with respect to the direction cosines of the magnetization . in ref .   the angle - dependent magnetotransport data of compressively strained ( ga , mn)as layers , grown on ( 001)- and ( 113)a - oriented gaas substrates , could be well simulated considering only terms up to the second order .    in the present work , we systematically study the influence of vertical strain on the amr and the ahe , investigating a series of compressive- to tensile - strained ( ga , mn)as layers , grown on ( in , ga)as templates with different in contents . an advanced macroscopic model is presented which phenomenologically describes the dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 on the magnetization orientation for cubic ferromagnets with tetragonal distortion along [ 001 ] . the analytic expressions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 are first discussed for a variety of configurations with in - plane and out - of - plane magnetization and are then used to analyze the angle - dependent resisivities recorded from the ( ga , mn)as layers under study .",
    "in contrast to ref .  , distinct features in the longitudinal out - of - plane amr occured which can only be described by taking into account terms up to the fourth order in the magnetization components .",
    "finally , the resistivity parameters , determined by fitting the calculated curves to the experimental data , are discussed as a function of the vertical strain in the layer .",
    "the model presented in this work applies not only to ( ga , mn)as but most generally to single - crystalline cubic and tetragonal ferromagnets .",
    "a series of differently strained ( ga , mn)as layers with constant thickness of @xmath2180 nm and mn concentration of @xmath25% was grown by low - temperature molecular - beam epitaxy on ( in , ga)as templates in the following way : after thermal deoxidation , a 30 nm thick gaas buffer layer was grown at a substrate temperature of @xmath3 580@xmath4c on semi - insulating gaas(001 ) .",
    "then the growth was interrupted , @xmath5 was lowered to @xmath2430@xmath4c , and a graded ( in , ga)as layer with a thickness between 0@xmath6 m and 5@xmath6 m was deposited following the method described in ref .  . in order to minimize the number of threading dislocations and to end up with different lateral lattice constants in the ( in , ga)as templates ,",
    "the in content was continuously increased in each template from 2% up to a maximum value of 13% .",
    "prior to the epitaxy of ( ga , mn)as , the growth was again interrupted and @xmath5 was lowered to @xmath2250@xmath4c . high - resolution x - ray diffraction ( hrxrd ) reciprocal space mapping ( rsm ) of the ( 224 ) reflex",
    "was used to determine the vertical strain @xmath7 of the ( ga , mn)as layers , where the relaxed lattice constants @xmath8 were derived from the lateral and vertical lattice constants @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , applying hooke s law .",
    "the values of @xmath11 were found to gradually vary from @xmath12 for the compressive - strained sample without ( in , ga)as template to @xmath13 for the tensile - strained sample with 13% in .",
    "moreover , rsm showed that the ( in , ga)as layers were almost completely relaxed whereas the ( ga , mn)as layers were fully strained .",
    "further details of the growth procedure and the rsm method will be presented elsewhere .    for the magnetotransport studies",
    "two types of hall bars with current directions along [ 100 ] and [ 110 ] were prepared on several pieces of the cleaved samples .",
    "the width of the hall bars is 0.3 mm and the longitudinal voltage probes are separated by 1 mm .",
    "high - field magnetotransport measurements ( up to 14.5 t ) at 4.2k yielded hole densities for the as - grown samples between @xmath14@xmath15 and @xmath16@xmath15 .",
    "least squares fits were performed to separate the contributions of the normal and anomalous hall effect .",
    "curie temperatures between 61k and 83k were estimated from the peak positions of the temperature - dependent sheet resistivities at 10 mt .",
    "for the angle - dependent magnetotransport measurements , carried out at 4.2k , the hall bars were mounted on the sample holder of a liquid - he - bath cryostat which was positioned between the poles of an electromagnet system providing a maximum field strength of 0.68 t .",
    "the sample holder has two perpendicular axes of rotation , allowing for any orientation of the hall bars with respect to the applied magnetic field @xmath17 .",
    "the macroscopic theoretical model presented in this paper is based on the assumption that the sample area probed by magnetotransport can be approximately treated as a single homogeneous ferromagnetic domain .",
    "it provides analytical expressions for the electrical resistivities as a function of the magnetization orientation .",
    "although the single - domain picture is known to usually break down in situations where the magnetic system is undergoing a magnetization reversal process , it has been successfully applied to the description of a variety of magnetization - related phenomena in ( ga , mn)as , particularly at sufficiently high external magnetic fields .    given a single ferromagnetic domain , the macroscopic magnetization is described by the vector @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes its magnitude and the unit vector @xmath20 with the components @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 its orientation . throughout this paper ,",
    "all vector components labeled by @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 refer to the cubic or tetragonal coordinate system associated with the [ 100 ] , [ 010 ] , and [ 001 ] crystal directions , respectively .",
    "we consider a standard configuration for magnetotransport measurements where the longitudinal voltage is probed along and the transverse voltage across the direction @xmath27 of a homogeneous current with density @xmath28 .",
    "accordingly , we introduce a right - handed coordinate system with unit vectors @xmath27 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 = @xmath31 , so that @xmath29 defines the transverse direction and @xmath30 typically the surface normal .",
    "the measured voltages arise from the components @xmath32 and @xmath33 of the electric field @xmath34 . starting from ohm s law @xmath35 with the resistivity tensor @xmath36 , the longitudinal resistivity @xmath0 ( sheet resistivity ) and transverse resistivity @xmath1 ( hall resistivity )",

    "we have presented analytical expressions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 including terms up to the second order .",
    "now , forced by the experimental results , we substantially extend this model by taking into account terms up to the fourth order . using the einstein summation convention , the series expansions read as @xmath39 where the components of the galvanomagnetic tensors @xmath40 , @xmath41 , ... appear as expansion coefficients .",
    "neumann s principle requires that a tensor representing a macroscopic physical property of a crystal must be invariant under all symmetry operations @xmath42 of the corresponding point group .",
    "the mathematical formulation of this requirement leads to conditional equations for the expansion coefficients reading as @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the @xmath45 component and @xmath46 the determinant of the symmetry matrix @xmath47 .",

    "<S> the longitudinal and transverse resistivities of differently strained ( ga , mn)as layers are theoretically and experimentally studied as a function of the magnetization orientation . </S>",
    "<S> the strain in the series of ( ga , mn)as layers is gradually varied from compressive to tensile using ( in , ga)as templates with different in concentrations . </S>",
    "<S> analytical expressions for the resistivities are derived from a series expansion of the resistivity tensor with respect to the direction cosines of the magnetization . in order to quantitatively model the experimental data , terms up to the fourth order have to be included . </S>",
    "<S> the expressions derived are generally valid for any single - crystalline cubic and tetragonal ferromagnet and apply to arbitrary surface orientations and current directions . </S>",
    "<S> the model phenomenologically incorporates the longitudinal and transverse anisotropic magnetoresistance as well as the anomalous hall effect . </S>",
    "<S> the resistivity parameters obtained from a comparison between experiment and theory are found to systematically vary with the strain in the layer . </S>"
