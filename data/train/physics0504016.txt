    "this goal has been accomplished by maupertuis and hamilton in different versions of the celebrated principle of least action .",
    "both formulations emerge from conceiving the trajectories of particles as light rays traversing different media which , according to fermat , follow the path that minimizes time .    in 1744 , maupertuis proposed that  nature , in the production of its effects , does so always by the simplest means \" @xcite and , in 1746 , wrote  in nature , the action ( _ la quantit daction _ ) necessary for change is the smallest possible .",

    "his name remains attached to the principle arguably for two reasons : his metaphysical view that minimum action expresses god s wisdom in the form of an economy principle@xcite , and euler s role in settling the controversy in his favor .",
    "hamilton s principle , formulated almost a century later , is similar to the principle of least action and is based on the optical - mechanical analogy as well.@xcite while the trajectory followed by a particle of fixed energy @xmath5 connecting two points in space is prescribed by the principle of least action , hamilton s principle determines the trajectory for which the particle will spend a given time @xmath6 in travelling between the same points .",
    "in such a case , the optimal path is the one for which the sum of the products @xmath7 along the path is a minimum ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the kinetic and potential energies and @xmath10 the time interval ) .",
    "hamilton s method was mentioned throughout the nineteenth century but was rarely used in practice because simpler methods were as effective in most cases.@xcite    the situation changed in 1926 when schrdinger , inspired by de broglie s ideas , resorted to hamilton s analogy between mechanics and geometric optics , extended the treatment from geometrical to undulatory mechanics , and arrived at his famous equation for the dynamics of a quantum mechanical particle.@xcite moreover , in 1948 , feynman@xcite ( following a hint from dirac ) offered a new perspective on hamilton s principle : in propagating between two points , a quantum particle  explores \" every path , treating them on equal footing .",
    "this  democracy of histories\"@xcite becomes the principle of least action for a classical particle due to destructive interference that eliminates those paths that differ significantly from the classical ( or extremal ) path .",
    "a lesser known approach to what is called now the principle of least action was taken by john bernoulli@xcite , who showed that snel s law can be obtained from the condition of mechanical equilibrium of a tense , non - stretchable string ( see figure [ figber ] ) .",
    "this analogy was also noted by mbius@xcite and discussed by ernst mach in his classical book on mechanics.@xcite ref .",
    "@xcite considers an inextensible string and is the only article i was able to find on this analogy .    in the present paper",
    "i show that a simple extension of this idea to paths that are covered in fixed time can be used to prove the equivalence of hamilton s principle to the static equilibrium of a _",
    "stretchable _ string .",
    "my aim is to provide , in the spirit of references @xcite , insight into why it is the the difference between the kinetic and potential energy that appears in hamilton s principle . in section [ unststr ] , i review bernoulli s approach and in section [ hamnc ] , i present a simplified derivation of hamilton s principle without calculus . in section [ hamc1 ] , i present a slightly more elaborate derivation using elementary calculus . given the importance of the principle of least action in so many areas of physics ,",
