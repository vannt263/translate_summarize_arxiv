    "the detectors having low background and low threshold are required for investigation of rare processes involving low energy neutrino and weak interacting particles .",
    "such detectors can be used effectively for search for the dark matter , for measurement of neutrino magnetic moment and coherent neutrino scattering by nuclei and for investigation of solar neutrino problem .",
    "for above investigations one needs low background detector of mass several @xmath0 and with threshold less than 1000 @xmath1 .",
    "the cryogenic and germanium detectors partly correspond to these requirements .",
    "the drawback of the cryogenic detectors is the complexity of their production and use .",
    "the drawback of germanium detectors is a rather high threshold @xmath2 @xmath3 which is due to a leakage current and electronic and microphonic noises .",
    "it would be very attractive to provide effective decreasing of the detector threshold using the internal proportional amplification of signal .",
    "internal proportional amplification in the semiconductor detectors is realized now in the silicon avalanche photodiodes ( apd ) @xmath4  , where a gain of about @xmath5 is achieved by avalanche multiplication of electrons at electric field @xmath6 @xmath7 in narrow @xmath8 junction with sensitive volume several @xmath9 .",
    "below we shall demonstrate the possibility of realizing the germanium detector with internal amplification ( gda ) and present its design .",
    "in semiconductor detectors ( as in a gas proportional counter - pc , or multiwire proportional chamber - mwpc ) the conditions for internal proportional amplification of electrons can be fulfilled .",
    "it is known that in apd critical electric field @xmath10 , that provides multiplication of electrons at room temperature , is equal @xmath11 @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath10 for germanium at liquid nitrogen temperature can be defined from the dependence of electron drift velocity on electric field and energy of production of electron - hole pairs and photons @xmath12 .",
    "for germanium at 77k the magnitude of @xmath10 derived in this fashion is equal @xmath13 @xmath7 . in apd and gas pc the critical electric field",
    "is produced by a different way . in the first case @xmath10",
    "is achieved by high concentration of impurities in narrow junction . as a result",
    "the sensitive volume of apd is several @xmath14 . in gas pc",
    "the @xmath10 can be achieved by special configuration of the electric field , due to large difference of cathode and anode sizes . in high purity germanium ( hpge ) with a sensitive volume near 100 @xmath15 the @xmath10 can be obtained by the same manner .",
    "electric field in the gas cylindrical pc is of the form : e(r)= where @xmath16 is applied voltage , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the radii of cathode and anode correspondingly , @xmath19 is a distance from anode .",
    "one can see from ( 1 ) that at @xmath20 @xmath16 , @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath22 @xmath24 is about @xmath25 @xmath7 near the anode . unlike gas pc the electric field in the coaxial detector from high purity germanium",
    "is defined not only by @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 but the concentration of donor ( n - type ) or acceptor ( p - type ) impurities as well .",
    "the magnitude of the volume charge in the sensitive volume of crystal depends on these impurities .",
    "the electric field in coaxial detector from hpge with regards to the impurities will be @xmath26 :    e(r)= r -  , where @xmath27 is impurity concentration , @xmath28 is the electron charge,@xmath29 is the dielectric constant of germanium .    the electric field ( 2 ) can be expressed with a depletion voltage @xmath30 , which is a minimum applied voltage necessary to neutralize the volume charge and to provide the sensitive region in the whole crystal volume .",
    "the @xmath31 for the coaxial detector , taking into account that @xmath32 , may be given by : v_d - r_2 ^ 2  . and the equation ( 2 )",
    "may be rewritten for n - type germanium in the final form : e(r)= - r -  . the dependence @xmath33 on @xmath19 is shown on fig.1 for coaxial detector from hpge .",
    "electric field near the anode reaches @xmath10 - magnitude required for avalanche multiplication of electrons .",
    "the coaxial germanium detector with internal amplification is the more appropriate for the low background spectrometers but the possibility of fabrication of inner electrode of 20 micron radius is highly conjectural presently .",
    "so we shall consider the more realistic problem - fabrication of planar germanium detector with internal amplification , multistrip planar germanium detector , similar in design to mwpc .",
    "the electric field in mwpc is of the form for one dimension case ( the coordinates x and y relate to an centered on the wire , x is parrelel to the wire plane , y is perpendicular ) : e(0,y)= where @xmath16 is applied voltage , @xmath34 is wire spacing , @xmath35 is a diameter of the wire and @xmath36 is the thickness of the planar detector . as in the case of coaxial germanium detector",
    "one must take into account for multistrip germanium detector the depletion voltage @xmath30 . in the case of planar germanium detector @xmath37 .",
    "the electric field for multistrip germanium detector is of the form : e(0,y ) = -y - where @xmath35 is the strip width .",
    "the dependence of @xmath38 on @xmath39 for multistrip germanium detector is shown on fig.2 . in the cases",
    "being considered the electric field near the anode is sufficient for avalanche multiplication of electrons ( @xmath40 @xmath7 ) .",
    "the amplification factor can be estimated as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a free electron path for inelastic scattering and @xmath43 is a length of avalanche region where @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath42 in germanium at 77@xmath45 is equal 0.5 micron and for @xmath46 @xmath22 @xmath43 is equal 5 micron ( see fig.2 ) so for this case it is possible to achieve @xmath47 . if one does not need high amplification factor it is possible to decrease @xmath16 or to increase the strip width @xmath34 .",
    "the gda is assumed to use for investigation of rare processes so the spectrometer including gda must have large mass of detector , it can be fabricated from separate modules of mass about 0.7 @xmath48 each .",
    "one module represents the multistrip planar germanium detector from hpge having impurity concentration less than @xmath49 @xmath50 , measures @xmath51 @xmath52 ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "the 12 anode strips of 20 micron width and of 65 @xmath53 length are fabricated by photomask method @xmath54 .",
    "the cathode area is equal @xmath55 @xmath56 and the fiducial volume is equal to 130 @xmath15 .",
    "there are the guard electrodes in the anode and cathode planes .",
    "the anode strips can be connected together however it is more convenient to take signals from separate strips to suppress the background compton gamma - quanta .    for the fabrication of gda",
    "it is necessary to use the germanium crystals of uniform distribution of impurities to provide homogenous electric field near the anode .",
    "second in importance it is the providing small depth and width of junction layer under the strips so the electric field near the strips is defined by junction dimensions .",
    "the design of gda must gurantee the reliable cooling of crystal since the critical electric field and amplification factor depend on free path of charge carriers which in its turn depends on temperature .",
    "the energy resolution of semiconductor detector will be given by e=    where @xmath57 is the intrinsic energy resolution of detector which is defined by statistical fluctuation in the number of charge carriers created in detector sensitive volume , @xmath58 is the energy resolution which is defined by associated electronics . in the case of gda these two terms will be of form e_int=2.34    and e_el= where @xmath59 is the energy to create one pair of charge carriers , @xmath60 is the energy deposited in the detector , @xmath61 is the fano factor , @xmath62 is the excess noise factor due to the fluctuation of multiplication , @xmath45 is the amplification factor , @xmath28 is the electron charge , @xmath63 is the absolute temperature of the resistors , @xmath64 is the total capacitance presented at the input of preamplifier , @xmath65 is the time constant of the rc circuits of the preamplifier , @xmath66 is the steepness of the field effect transistor characteristic , @xmath67 is the resistance at the input of the preamplifier , @xmath68 is the detector leakage surface current and @xmath69 is the detector leakage balk current due to the thermal generation of charge carriers .",
    "according to the calculation for gda with k@xmath7010 one must take into account in the formula for @xmath58 only the last term due to the bulk leakage current and the formula ( 7 ) for gda can be rewritten as e2.36k where @xmath59 and @xmath60 is in ev , @xmath69 is in na and @xmath65 is in @xmath71 .",
    "the gda energy threshold is defined by @xmath72 or more exactly by the last term in ( 10 ) : e_th 2.36    one can estimate the @xmath73 for microstrip planar detector from hpge of volume 100 @xmath15 with internal amplification : at n=@xmath49@xmath50 , @xmath69=0.01 na per one strip , @xmath65=0.5 @xmath71 and @xmath62=0.5 : @xmath74 12 ev .",
    "the dependance of relative energy resolution @xmath75e / e on energy in the more interesting energy range @xmath76 @xmath1 for gda is shown in table .",
    "the dependance of relative energy resolution @xmath75e / e on energy [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + the internal amplification of gda degrades the performance somewhat , but such energy resolution of gda is adequate to the investigation of above problems .",
    "it is interesting to note that common planar detector from hpge of volume 100 @xmath15 produced by `` canberra '' ( type gl3825r ) has relative energy resolution about 8@xmath77 at e=5900 ev .",
    "presently germanium detectors are in considerable use in low background measurements for high purity of germanium crystals : their content of radioactive impurity does not exceed @xmath78 @xmath79 .",
    "if the internal amplification is realized in germanium detectors and their threshold is lowered to several @xmath1 the possibility for their use will considerably increase .",
    "firstly , the lowering of the detector threshold makes it possible to extend the kinematical domain of investigations , secondly , it enables in some cases significantly to decrease the level of background . following are brief discussions of prospects of gda using for neutrino magnetic moment ( @xmath80 ) measurement , for investigation of neutrino coherent scattering by nuclei and for search for `` light '' wimps .",
    "a laboratory measurement of the nmm is based on its contribution to the ( anti)neutrino - electron scattering . for a non - zero nmm",
    "the differential over the kinetic energy @xmath81 of the recoil electron cross section @xmath82 is given by the sum of the weak interaction cross section and the electromagnetic one . at a small recoil energy",
    "the weak part practically constant , while the electromagnetic one grows as @xmath83 towards low energies . for improving the sensitivity to @xmath80",
    "it is necessary to lower the threshold for detecting the recoil electrons as far as the background conditions allow .",
    "now there is number of the projects dedicated to the nmm measurements with detectors of mass @xmath84 kg and with thresholds of @xmath85 kev .",
    "authors of proposal @xmath86 are going to use germanium detector with mass of 2 kg and threshold of 3 kev to achieve for two years reactor measurement the limit on @xmath87 , with @xmath88 being the bhorh magneton .",
    "the use of gda with internal amplification in this experiment would provide possibility to achieve limit on @xmath80 about 2@xmath89 .",
    "however , one can not significantly low the gda threshold in the reactor experiment for two reasons .",
    "firstly , one must take into account atomic binding effect for electrons",
    ". the total @xmath90 cross section will be 30@xmath77 less due to the binding effects ( in the energy range @xmath91 ev ) .",
    "the secondly at t@xmath92500 ev the effect neutrino coherent scattering ( ncs ) by germanium nuclei will surpass the effect of @xmath93 scatttering and ncs will present physical background relative to the @xmath93 scattering . nevertheless the low gda threshold can be used in full measure if one uses artifical neutrino source ( ans ) instead of reactor .",
    "nowadays there are several proposals on development ans with activity @xmath94 mci @xmath95 .",
    "although the development and construction of the ans is rather expensive and challenging problem the use of ans offers some advantages over the reactor based experiments :            presently the more appropriate ans for nmm measurement is a tritium source proposed in @xmath98 for measurement of nmm by means of low threshold cryogenic silicon detector .",
    "the end - point energy of tritium beta spectra is 18,6 kev and for maximum recoil electron energy a kinematical limitation gives : t_max = = 1260 ev . if one uses tritium ans with activity 40 mci then the neutrino density flux will be 6@xmath99 1/@xmath97 in the detector position .",
    "the limit on nmm about 3@xmath100 can be achieved during one year measurement time with silicon detector mass of 3 kg in the energy range @xmath101 ev .",
    "the very same limit on nmm can be achieved by use the gda with mass of 3 kg during one year of measurement time in the energy range @xmath102 ev . in the gda case",
    "the count rate due to electromagnetic neutrino interaction will be 0.24 event / d ( at @xmath103 ) , the count rate due to weak interaction will be one order of magnitude less .",
    "now let us consider the background count rate .",
    "if one takes into account that @xmath104 then the value of @xmath105 in the energy range @xmath106 kev(@xmath107 ) and @xmath102 ev(@xmath108 ) will be the very same .",
    "the best level of background for germanium detector was achieved in @xmath109 and it is equal 0.1 event / kev@xmath110kg@xmath110d . if one assume that level of background does not depend on energy in the energy range of interest then the level of background in the second energy interval will be two order of magnitude less since @xmath111 and will be 0.15 event / d .",
    "in addition in the case of tritium ans there is no physical background due to the ncs since in this case the maximum recoil energy of germanium nuclei @xmath112 is equal 0.01 ev .      the use of gda can open up the possibility to investigate the coherent neutrino scattering by nuclei .",
    "this interaction is of great importance into interstellar processes and up to now did not observed in laboratory because the very low kinetic energy transferred to nucleus in the process of neutrino - nucleus scattering .",
    "for germanium nucleus and reactor antineutrino spectrum the maximum kinetic recoil energy is about @xmath112=2500 ev and taking into account quenching effect only one third of this energy are imparted on ionization @xmath113 .",
    "so one needs germanium detector with threshold significantly lower 800 ev for investigation of ncs by germanium nuclei .",
    "such low threshold can be provided by gda having internal amplification about 10@xmath114 .",
    "the differential cross section of ncs by nuclei @xmath115 can be expressed by : n^2m(1- ) ( ) ^2 z^2 ( ) where m , n and z are the mass , neutron and charge numbers of nuclei correspondingly and t@xmath116 - nucleus recoil energy .",
    "if one uses gda with mass of 3 kg and threshold 30 ev in the reactor experiment the count rate due ncs in the energy range @xmath117 ev will be near 100 event / d at antineutrino intensity @xmath118 @xmath119 due to the weak interaction .",
    "the count rate due to the electromagnetic interaction ( at @xmath120 ) will be 0.45 event / d . the level of detector background will be only 0.1 event / d if one uses the above estimations of detector background , taking into account that the energy range is equal 0.3 kev in this case .",
    "so one can see that use of gda for measurement ncs makes it possible :    *   to improve the weak interaction constants , *   to investigate the neutrino oscillations by alternative way , *   to make more precise the quenching factor for germanium nuclei at low energy transfer which is of interest for dark matter experiments .",
    "presently in dark matter experiments the main efforts are directed at decreasing of the background and lowering of the energy threshold of the detector , since for more appropriate dark matter candidate- wimps or weakly interacting massive particles - the expected count rate for wimps - nuclear scattering is in the range @xmath121 event / kg@xmath110d and expected recoil energy @xmath122 lies in the wide energy range beginning of some tens @xmath1 and above .",
    "significant success was achieved by cdms ( cryogenic dark matter search ) collaboration in radiation background decreasing @xmath123 .",
    "the rejection of 99@xmath77 of photon background was achieved use detectors which simultaneously measure the recoil energy in both- photon and charge mediated signals . however , this method is effective at detector threshold above 15 kev .",
    "so experiments for search for wimps with mass lower than 10 gev/@xmath124 ( at very low t ) are carried out now by cresst ( cryogenic rare event search with superconducting thermometers ) collaboration @xmath125 which plans to use cryogenic detector including four 250 g sapphire detectors with threshold 500 ev .",
    "the using of several gda modules of mass 1 kg each with threshold about 30 ev would be very effective in this investigations .    the investigation of solar neutrino problem with use gda can provide possibility to detect simultaneously the whole neutrino spectrum @xmath126 but one needs of course to use large mass detector in this case .",
    "it is beleived that gda being developed will find also use in the applied fields .",
