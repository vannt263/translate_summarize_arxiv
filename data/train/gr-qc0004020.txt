    "2-dimensional locally homogeneous spaces ensure that the different cases will yield different solutions .      in the kantowski - sachs case we have @xmath50 .",

    "smooth continuing the desitter solution to the region outside the desitter horizon gives the ks metric@xcite .",
    "we also note that the @xmath97 symmetry is manifestly broken with the inclusion of classical dust . due to the conservation of the rest mass of the dust ,",

    "desitter - like solutions : solutions where the universe evolves approximately as that of desitter solutions with positively curved hypersurfaces .    if @xmath134 the ( test ) matter has enough energy to escape the gravitational collapse ( expanding solutions ) or enough energy to prevent the gravitational repulsion from the cosmological constant ( contracting solutions ) .",
    "all of these solutions are also valid for the case @xmath94 the ks case . but to obtain the ks solutions it is not enough to solve just the mass equation .",
    "from here on we will only consider the case where the cosmological constant is non - negative .",
    "as we saw from the classical case , if the `` energy '' is small enough the solutions are confined to be either schwarzschild - like or desitter - like .",

    "a quantum mechanical system may tunnel though classical barriers . in our case",
    "this means that a small schwarzscild - like universe may tunnel though the potential barrier to become a desitter - like universe !",
    "this has striking consequences .",
    "if we imagine that a `` mother '' universe could spontaneously create schwarzschild - like black holes of less than a planck - length , there will be a non - zero probability that one of these will tunnel through the potential barrier , and end up in an ever - expanding desitter state .",

    "in addition we have the momentum constraint equation .",
    "these two equations are functional differential equations and thus in general very difficult to solve .",
    "kkty managed in the case @xmath136 to find a couple of special cases where the wave function was exactly derived and interpreted @xcite . since the mass equation is a special combination of the momentum and energy constraint , the mass equation itself can be considered as a constraint .",
    "the wave function has to obey : @xmath137 the wavefunction has to be an eigenfunctional of the mass - operator @xmath138 with eigenvalue @xmath139 , and from the classical interpretation we have to assume that the eigenvalue @xmath139 has to obey @xmath140 .    in the wkb approximation",
    "we can integrate the hamilton - jacobi equation if we choose a particular and simple path  @xcite .",

    "also an article by atkatz and pagels  @xcite seems to indicate that open universes can not be created by a tunneling event .",
    "a key argument used in both of these articles is that the transition amplitude is suppressed by the infinite integral over the three - dimensional hypersurfaces .",
    "however , a more recent article by coule and martin @xcite used the fact that there exists @xmath197 compact spacelike hypersurfaces .",
    "since they are compact they will have finite volume .",
    "their conclusion is opposite of that of the previous two articles : the creation of a open @xmath197 frw universe is more likely than a closed @xmath198 universe through a tunneling event .",
    "our case is however more subtle , since the hypersurfaces are no longer homogeneous .",
    "as we have investigated the wkb wavefunctions in this model , we might wonder whether an inhomogeneous universe is more likely to be created through a tunneling event than a homogeneous one . as an inhomogeneity measure in this model",
    "it is very useful to use the weyl curvature tensor @xmath199 .",
    "all of the frw models are conformally flat , thus for the all of the frw model the weyl tensor will vanish . in our case",
    "the opposite is also true , if @xmath200 and @xmath51 in the lt model then the spacetime is spatially homogeneous . if we define a mean dust density function @xmath201 by : m(r)=|r^3 we can write the weyl curvature invariant in the lt model as : c^c _ = ^2(|-)^2 thus this space - time is homogeneous if and only if @xmath202 .",
    "the inhomogeneity in this model is therefore almost completely characterized by the mass function @xmath139 .",
    "the homogeneous mass function will go as @xmath203 , where @xmath204 is a constant . investigating only closed universes ,",
    "we fix the constant @xmath204 so that @xmath205 .",
    "the most physical interesting universes that these lt models describe will have a larger amount of dust consentrated in the inner regions than the outher regions .",
    "the most extreme inhomogeneous mass function is the schwarzschild mass function , @xmath206 .",
    "thus it is very reasonable to assume that we have a mass distribution that obeys : m_sch(r)m(r)m_h(r ) if we compare the wkb tunneling potential @xmath207 $ ] for these different mass distributions we see that we get v_sch(r)v(r ) v_h(r ) keeping all other parameters fixed .",
    "thus the more inhomogeneous the space is the smaller the tunneling barrier will be . in the wkb approximation",
    "this means that the probability of the creation of an inhomogeneous universe is larger than for a homogeneous universe .",
    "more specific the spontaneous creation of a schwarzschild - desitter like universe appears to be more probable than a homogeneous frw universe .",
    "we also have be aware of that the matter lagrangian describes dust .",
    "dust is an idealised form of matter that has no internal pressure . as the dust density becomes high , either in an early stage of the universe or in large local inhomogeneities this assumption of a pressure - free matter langrangian becomes somewhat artificial and unphysical . in these situations",
    "we know that the internal pressure becomes very important and even quantum effects from the matter fields are essential in the description . in this sence we may say that these calculations more or less are `` valid '' only with small local inhomogeneities or they describe the effect from _ gravity itself _ to produce inhomogeneities .",
    "this point is also emphasized by conradi@xcite .",
    "conradi discusses the wave function of an anisotropic ks space with a dust lagrangian .",
    "he argues that since dust interacts only locally , in the sence that it does not self - interact , this local `` tunneling '' process can not be interpreted as a tunneling effect .",
    "our results should therefore perhaps be seen from a more phenomological point of view .",
    "the matter lagrangian used in this paper is one of the most simple source field that give rise to inhomogeneities .",
    "the source field used is also interesting because it connects the schwarzschild spacetime with the frw spacetime in a smooth way .",
    "in a hamiltonian description of general relativity there has been a consensus among physicists and cosmologists that the issue of topology is essential and necessary in the description @xcite .",
    "this has also been emphasized in this paper . at the classical level we saw",
    "that apparently different cases would lead to the same spacetime if the symmetry spaces were infinite and simply connected . assuming compactness and multiply connectedness this pathology",
    "was removed and yielded some interesting spacetimes .    in the quantum mechanical case we provided a simpler model which was in general inhomogeneous , but removed many of the algebraic difficulties in the full kslt model .",
    "it was emphasized how this model could describe a quantum creation of a inhomogeneous universe through quantum tunneling .",
    "we also showed that under some reasonable assumptions the creation of an inhomogeneous universe was more probable than a homogeneous frw universe . in the absence of interacting matter",
    "this is very reasonable because there are a lot more inhomogeneous configurations than homogeneous ones .",
    "even though the full theory of quantum gravity is far from being established , it seems like quantum cosmology _ could _",
    "describe many of the features of the initial universe . in the recent decade",
    "the interest for topology in cosmology has expanded the application for quantum cosmology . even in classical gravity",
    "the inclusion of non - trivial topologies has yielded new and surprising results .",
    "i deeply appreciate the help and comments which yvind grn has given me during the work of this paper .",
