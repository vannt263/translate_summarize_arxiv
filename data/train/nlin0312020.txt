    ". can self - focus and become singular in a finite time .",
    "this phenomenon is called _ wave collapse _ or _ blowup of the wave amplitude_. more precisely , there is no blowup when @xmath9 but for any @xmath10 , there exist solutions with @xmath11 for which there is blowup @xcite .",

    "moreover , the positivity of @xmath15 ensures that this solution decays exponentially at infinity .",
    "this solution is called the _ ground state _ or _",

    "moreover , the townes soliton is _ unstable _ , i.e. small perturbations of this solution lead to either expansion of the initial data or blowup in finite time .",
    "the case where @xmath6 is not constant but a continuous periodic function of @xmath25 has arisen recently in different fields of applications of eq .",

    "the intuitive idea is that ( oscillating ) bound states could be obtained by combining cycles of positive and negative @xmath6 values so that after an expansion and contraction regime the solution could come back to the initial state . in this way",
    "some sort of pulsating trapped solution , i.e. , a _ breather _ , could be generated .",
    "this idea was first proposed in the field of nonlinear optics @xcite . in that context",
    ", two - dimensional solitary waves have been proposed for optical systems @xcite . there ,",
    "a spatial modulation of the kerr coefficient ( the nonlinearity ) of the optical material is used to prevent collapse so that the beam becomes collapsing and expanding in alternating regions and is stabilized in average .",

    "@xcite some general results are provided for generic nonlinearities . finally in ref .",
    "@xcite stabilized vector solitons have been proposed and studied .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study in more detail the stabilization mechanism .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : first , in sec .",
    "[ method ] we present the numerical method used to integrate the equations , which involves a fourier pseudospectral scheme , a split  step scheme and the use of an absorbing potential which allows to get rid of the radiation . in sec .",
    "[ stabilization ] we discuss the phenomenon of stabilization of solutions of the nlse and show quantitatively that the structure that remains stabilized is a townes soliton , thus confirming the conjecture raised in ref . @xcite .",
    "we also study the robustness of the stabilized soliton under parameter variations .",
    "finally , in sec . [ conclusions ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "in this paper we study eq . numerically . to this end",
    "we have developed a fourier pseudospectral scheme for the discretization of the spatial derivatives combined with a split - step scheme to compute the time evolution .",
    "split - step schemes are based on the observation that many problems may be decomposed into exactly solvable parts and on the fact that the full problem may be approximated as a composition of the individual problems .",
    "for instance , the solution of partial differential equations of the type @xmath26 can be approximated from the exact solutions of the problems @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "to approximate properly the solutions of eq .",
    "we include an absorbing potential in the border of the simulation region to extract the outgoing radiation and provide some sort of local transparent boundary conditions .",
    "this potential may be included in eq . as a complex term @xcite so that the new equation we will discretize is @xmath29u,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is a positive real function which must be chosen to maximize the absorption of the radiation while minimizing the effect on trapped structures ( i.e. to mimic the behavior of true transparent boundary conditions ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath31 will satisfy specific boundary conditions on the border of the simulation region @xmath32 . as @xmath33 and @xmath34 we expect @xmath35 .",
    "let us decompose the evolution operator in eq . by taking @xcite    @xmath36    to proceed with split - step type methods it is necessary to compute the explicit form of the operators @xmath37 and @xmath38 . to get the action of the operators we solve the subproblems    [ subpro ] @xmath39    since @xmath40 , eq . ( [ a2 ] ) can be solved in fourier space . denoting the spatial fourier transform of @xmath41 by @xmath42 we get @xmath43",
    "whose explicit solution is @xmath44 .    to solve ( [ b2 ] ) we write @xmath45 and substituting in eq .",
    "we get , from the real part , @xmath46 whose solution is @xmath47 the imaginary part of eq . is @xmath48 whose solution is @xmath49 finally , we can write @xmath50 in this way , by defining the time step @xmath51 as @xmath52 , @xmath53 , after a suitable renaming we obtain the explicit form of the operators    @xmath54    specifically , when @xmath3 is given by @xmath55 , as we have used in our simulations it is possible to write explicitly the integral in obtaining @xmath56-(\\omega\\sin\\omega t-2v_a\\cos\\omega   t)\\right\\}.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] having the explicit form of the solutions of the subproblems allows us to obtain the solution of eq . to any degree of accuracy .",
    "we have used two different splittings : the classical method of second order and a fourth order optimized method @xcite whose equations are    [ splittings ] @xmath57    with @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 . both methods are symmetric compositions of operators .",
    "however , method requires only one evaluation of @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( instead of two ) per step because it is possible to concatenate terms using the first same as last ( fsal ) property . for method",
    "the computational cost per step is much higher since even using the fsal property the number of evaluations of @xmath65 and @xmath66 is six .",
    "these schemes have many advantages . from the practical point of view",
    "the calculation of the fourier transform , which is the most computer time - consuming step in the calculations , may be done by using the fast fourier transform ( fft ) .",
    "thus the computational cost of the method is of order @xmath67 , being @xmath68 the points number in each spatial direction of the grid which is quite acceptable . the use of discrete transforms to represent",
    "the continuous fourier transform in implicitly imposes periodic boundary conditions on @xmath41 .",
    "however , since @xmath41 is expected to be negligible on the boundaries ( otherwise the computational domain must be enlarged or the absorbing potential corrected ) this is not an essential point .",
    "another convenient property of these schemes is their preservation of the @xmath69-norm of the solutions .",
    "the implementation of transparent boundary conditions is essential to avoid misleading results as it will be clear later .",
    "this is because of the decomposition of initial data into trapped states plus some outgoing radiation , a situation which is typical of nls problems with fixed coefficients @xcite and also happens in the case at hand .",
    "specifically , we have chosen as absorbing potential @xmath70 , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 characterize the absorber .",
    "the choice of the parameter values must be done to maximize the absorption of the outgoing radiation . to choose optimal values we have made several tests by making a townes soliton collides with absorbing potentials of several amplitudes and widths .",
    "we have computed the reflection ( r ) and transmission ( t ) coefficients defined as @xmath73 , @xmath74 where @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the initial data , the part of the initial data which moves backwards after reflection , and the part of the initial data which moves forward after crossing the absorbing potential , respectively .",
    "typical examples of the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ potencial ] .",
    "one must choose a value for @xmath78 large enough to ensure a good absorption , whereas the width @xmath72 of the absorbing potential can not be chosen too large , since then either the effect on stabilized structures could be non - negligible or the integration region should be enlarged to non - practical sizes .    when the absorbing potential is absent the numerical simulations are misleading and the trapping effects are altered , because the radiation interacts with the stabilized structure leading to spurious destabilization . in figs .",
    "[ sinabs ] and [ soliton2d ] we illustrate this behavior starting with a townes soliton as initial data .",
    "in refs . @xcite it has been shown that if @xmath6 is an adequate periodic function @xmath3 it is possible to obtain a stabilized structure starting from different types of initial data , such as townes solitons or gaussian functions . in figs .",
    "[ soliton2d ] and [ gauss2d ] we summarize results taking as initial data a townes soliton and a gaussian function , respectively .    in both cases",
    "we get stabilization but in the case of gaussian initial data , a readjustment is produced by ejecting outside the central region a significant part of the wave packet .",
    "this happens during the first 10 time units where the width increases significantly due to the contribution of the outgoing wave .",
    "this wave is dissipated when hits the absorbing region leading to the step in the norm evolution shown in fig .",
    "[ gauss2d](b ) .",
    "it was also conjectured in ref .",
    "@xcite that the stabilized solution after this process might be a scaled townes soliton ( which would explain why the stabilization of the townes soliton looks smoother ) . in this section we support this conjecture quantitatively with precise numerical simulations of eq . using the numerical schemes of sec .",
    "[ method ] .    to study the shape of the stabilized soliton we define the error functional @xmath79 and the error function @xmath80 as @xmath81 .",
    "note that according to eq .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 parametrizes the shape of the townes solitons in such a way that if @xmath15 increases the width of the soliton decreases and the amplitude increases . the error function @xmath80 measures the distance between the solution of eq . and the family of townes solitons .",
    "we have computed numerically the function @xmath80 by evaluating the integrals in for a large set of @xmath15 values and then choosing the minimum between all of them .    in fig .",
    "[ errortownes ] we summarize our results when a townes soliton is taken as initial data .",
    "we see , in fig .",
    "[ errortownes](b ) that @xmath82 oscillates about a value of @xmath83 , with a maximum of about @xmath84 .",
    "this means that the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gpe3 ] ) can be approximated by a townes soliton at all times with a maximum error in the norm of about @xmath85 which is definitely small .",
    "in fact , this number could be even compatible with zero taking into account the number of approximations involved in our computation : the discretization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gpe3 ] ) , the absorbing potential , the calculation of the integral and the discrete set of @xmath15 values chosen to compute the minimum .    when gaussian initial data are taken ( fig .",
    "[ errorgauss ] ) we start with an optimal fitting whose error is about @xmath86 .",
    "this error decreases with time to a value around of @xmath87 similar to the one in the townes soliton case .",
    "this provides a quantitative support to the idea that gaussian ( or other ) initial profiles evolve into a stabilized townes soliton by ejecting a fraction of their amplitude in the form of radiation .    moreover , in figs .",
    "[ errortownes](a ) and [ errorgauss](a ) we see that the minimum points @xmath88 evolve according to what we expected .",
    "they oscillate in phase opposition respect to the width evolution of the solutions ( see figs .",
    "[ soliton2d ] and [ gauss2d ] ) , because an increase of the width corresponds to a decrease of @xmath15 and viceversa ( see eq . ) .      finally , to have an idea of the range of parameter values for which stabilization is possible , we have made simulations when a townes soliton is taken as initial data moving the @xmath89 and @xmath90 parameters ( @xmath91 fixed ) .",
    "we have found that for @xmath92 $ ] and @xmath93 $ ] the stabilization is possible although evolution of the width and of the amplitude shows different behaviors . in fig .",
    "[ barrido ] we plot the results for several parameter values .",
    "in this paper we have developed an accurate numerical scheme to study the stabilization of solutions of the two - dimensional cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation under variations of the nonlinear coefficient .",
    "we have also given numerical evidences in favor of the conjecture raised in ref .",
    "@xcite concerning the shape of stabilized solitons .",
