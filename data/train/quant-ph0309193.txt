    "nonlocality is one of the most profound aspects of a quantum mechanical system and it is a fundamental resource for quantum information processing .",
    "nonlocality has been studied commonly in the operational perspective based on bell s inequalities for bipartite two - dimensional systems with dichotomic measurements .",

    "@xcite considered joint probabilities of two distant measurements and suggested how to compare the strength of nonlocality between different dimensional systems for different numbers of measurement outcomes .",
    "a maximally entangled pure system violates bell s inequality but as enough white noise is added the system loses its nonlocality .",
    "proposed the fraction of white noise as a measure of nonlocality , which may be used for its cross - dimensional comparison .",
    "their numerical analysis for a maximally entangled state showed that the degree of violation increases monotonically with respect to the number of outcomes .",
    "more recently , collins _",
    "@xcite developed a family of bell s inequalities for an arbitrary finite number of measurement outcomes .",
    "the family of inequalities are in good agreement with kaszlikowski _",
    "s results in terms of their measure of nonlocality .",
    "these studies would imply that the critical fraction of white noise is a useful measure in comparing the amounts of nonlocality for the different dimensional systems .",
    "the measure of nonlocality based on the noise fraction is , on the other hand , criticized by acin _",
    "@xcite as they found that partially entangled systems can give the larger violation ( or stronger resistance to noise ) of the bell s inequality than the maximally entangled state .",
    "the other approach for a substantial violation of local realism was introduced by van dam _",
    "_ @xcite and they found that chsh inequality is the strongest nonlocality test for a bipartite system in terms of the statistical strength .    in the test of bell s inequality , a set of unitary transformations play an important role in the violation of bell s inequality because local measurement settings for each party are characterized by local unitary transformations . in earlier studies",
    "@xcite , the transformations are restricted to quantum fourier transformations ( qft ) . for a @xmath0-dimensional system the most general unitary transformation forms the group su(@xmath0 ) .",
    "it is thus questionable whether the qft is sufficient to fully reveal quantum nonlocality .",
    "it has been known that the qft is sufficient for a maximally entangled system of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "however , it is still an open question for other dimensional systems and , more importantly , for an arbitrarily entangled system .",
    "this question is investigated in this paper .",
    "quantum nonlocality for continuous - variable ( cv ) systems has been studied in various contexts .",
    "bell argued that the original einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) state @xcite would not violate bell - like inequalities since it has a positive - definite wigner function and thus its correlation function with respect to position and momentum observables can be simulated by local hidden variables . on the other hand , introducing dichotomic measurements such as even or odd parities of the photon number and presence or absence of photons , banaszek and wdkiewicz @xcite showed the nonlocality of the epr state .",
    "the measurements follow displacement operations , that is , translations in the phase spaces of the modes . however , the scheme by banaszek and wdkiewicz did not give a maximal violation for the inequality .",
    "this motivated chen _",
    "@xcite to investigate another type of observable , with the unitary transformations other than the displacement in phase space , which results in the maximal violation for epr state .",
    "the observable , so - called `` pseudo - spin '' operator , is defined as tensor summations of pauli spin operators , which is element of an su(@xmath3 ) group .",
    "the generalization of a dichotomic measurement to an arbitrary finite number of outcomes for a nonlocality test of a cv state was proposed by brukner _",
    "@xcite as establishing a correspondence between a cv and a discrete system of an arbitrary finite dimension .",
    "however , in their work , it is not clear whether the correspondence can be given as a physically plausible map , _",
    "i.e. _ a completely positive ( cp ) map .",
    "moreover , in their analysis for nonlocality , brukner _",
    "_ did not employ general transformations in su(@xmath0 ) but the simple qft transformations in varying the configuration of measurements .",
    "thus the question of qft being sufficient to reveal nonlocality arises in cv systems as well as in the finite - dimensional systems .    in this paper",
    ", we formulate the bell s inequality in terms of a linear summation of correlation functions which utilize the most general projective @xmath0-outcome measurements . for the correlation function",
    ", we introduce a general form of correlation observable between two @xmath0-level systems and find the eigenvalues from the generic conditions that any correlation function should satisfy . for the observable ,",

    "the subgroup algebra of su(@xmath0 ) allows us to prove that @xmath4 number of real parameters are sufficient to describe the local unitary operation . by inspecting symmetries and performing numerical analysis ,",
    "we show , while the qft suffices for a maximally entangled system , a partially entangled system requires more general transformations in order to fully investigate its nonlocality .",
    "the bell s inequalities are applied to a cv state whose infinite - dimensional hilbert space is decomposed onto the tensor sum of @xmath0-dimensional subspaces .",
    "the decomposition maps any cv state onto an arbitrary finite - dimensional state .",
    "we prove that the mapping is linear , trace preserving , complete positive . after applying the mapping , we investigate the violation of bell s inequality for the two - mode squeezed vacuum state , as an example of a cv state , with the different outcome measurements . to search for the optimal violation in su(@xmath0 ) transformation ,",
    "several numerical methods are assessed .",
    "in this section , we investigate bell s inequalities by considering the su(@xmath0 ) group of transformations for the measurement with @xmath0 outcomes .",

    "we found the mapping is linear , trace preserving and complete positive map and it corresponds to a highly degenerate @xmath0-outcome measurement on a cv state . by applying the highly degenerate measurements , we investigated the optimal violation of the bell s inequality for the two - mode squeezed state .",
