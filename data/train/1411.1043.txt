    "string theory has various defect branes ( or codimension - two branes ) , including the well - known d7-brane and various exotic branes . in the supergravity description ,",
    "some of the corresponding backgrounds are called non - geometric backgrounds or u - folds @xcite , since the transition functions between coordinate patches are given by u - duality transformations .",
    "in particular , the authors in @xcite pointed out that the background of @xmath2-branes @xcite has a t - duality monodromy and it is a concrete example of non - geometric backgrounds in string theory .",
    "the non - trivial monodromies of defect branes , which is familiar for a d7-brane , generally raise a perplexing problem related to the charge conservation law .",

    "where does the original charge of the probe go and how is the charge conservation law kept intact ?",
    "in @xcite , it was proposed that the charge is indeed conserved if we measure the charge by using the page charge @xcite , which is one of the possible definitions of charge . however , in defect - brane backgrounds , the definition of the ( page ) charge depends on the choice of a cycle for a flux integral ( see @xcite and section [ sec : defect - alice ] ) .",
    "thus , it is desirable to define the charge in a consistent manner to analyze the ( apparent ) charge changing phenomena .    in the literature ,",
    "the similar issue was discussed in a certain class of @xmath3-dimensional gauge theories which admit vortex solutions with non - trivial monodromies @xcite .",
    "one of the most famous and studied example is a vortex called an alice string @xcite , whose monodromy is given by a charge conjugation .",
    "that is , after a particle with charge @xmath4 goes around an alice string , the sign of its charge flips . in the presence of alice strings , `` a charge with no localized source , '' called a cheshire charge @xcite , plays an important role in the discussion of the charge conservation law . in this paper",

    "the reason why we use the primed coordinates for the purpose of measuring the winding charge will be discussed in section [ sec : defect - alice ] .",

    "in this section , we first give a detailed review of the notions of alice string and cheshire charge , which appear in a certain type of @xmath3-dimensional gauge theories .",
    "we then argue that defect branes in string theory can be regarded as alice strings and discuss the charge changing process in the kk - vortex background from this point of view .",
    "alice strings @xcite and cheshire charges @xcite appear in @xmath3-dimensional gauge theories where a charge conjugation is a gauge symmetry of the theories .",
    "for clearness , we explain alice strings and cheshire charges by using one of the simplest models which admits alice strings @xcite .",
    "consider a @xmath3-dimensional gauge theory with gauge symmetry @xmath111 and a scalar field in the @xmath112-dimensional representation , which we denote as a real symmetric traceless @xmath113 matrix @xmath114 . by choosing a quartic potential @xmath115 with appropriate coefficients ,",
    "the classical vacuum configuration is given by @xmath116 in a certain gauge .",
    "if we denote the generators of @xmath111 as @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) , the unbroken gauge symmetry ( which keeps the vacuum configuration @xmath119 invariant ) is a subgroup @xmath120 , where the @xmath121 transformation is generated by @xmath122 and the @xmath123 transformation is generated by @xmath124 since @xmath125 and @xmath126 satisfies @xmath127 , @xmath126 corresponds to charge conjugation associated with the unbroken @xmath121 gauge symmetry .    in this model ,",
    "an alice string solution can be constructed as follows . in order to make the energy of the configuration finite ,",
    "we first impose @xmath128 at spatial infinity where @xmath129 is a covariant derivative associated with the @xmath130 gauge field .",
    "this condition is satisfied with @xmath131 where we have set @xmath132 and @xmath133 are polar coordinates in the two - dimensional space transverse to the string .",
    "secondly , we impose the condition that @xmath134 be in the disconnected part of the gauge group ; @xmath135 this is the defining property of alice strings .",
    "concretely , we will choose @xmath136 , which can be realized by setting @xmath137 .",
    "this leads to the following ansatz for the global behavior of an alice string : @xmath138 the functions @xmath139 and @xmath140 can be determined numerically from the equations of motion ( see e.g.  @xcite ) although we will not need it here .",
    "according to the @xmath80-dependence in , the embedding of @xmath141 into @xmath111 is non - trivially rotated around the string .",
    "namely , if we define the unbroken subgroup of @xmath142 at @xmath80 by @xmath143 , equation leads to @xmath144 correspondingly , the @xmath121 generator @xmath145 of @xmath146 is related with the @xmath121 generator @xmath147 of @xmath148 as @xmath149 if we set @xmath147 to be @xmath125 , for @xmath23 , we have @xmath150 that is , the sign of the @xmath121 generator becomes opposite as one goes around the string once .",
    "this property is the reason why the vortex is called an alice string ; the monodromy works as a `` charge - conjugation looking glass '' @xcite . since @xmath151 ,",
    "the @xmath121 generator is double - valued in the transverse two - dimensional space .    in the presence of alice strings , the electrodynamics associated with the unbroken @xmath121 gauge group",
    "is called alice electrodynamics .",
    "it is locally similar to the usual electrodynamics but has a strange phenomenon ; when a charged particle goes around the alice string once , the sign of the charge flips like @xmath152 due to property .",
    "apparently this phenomenon seems to be in conflict with the charge conservation law .    in order to discuss the charge conservation in the alice string background",
    "more precisely , we need to explain another issue closely related with the charge flipping phenomenon . in the presence of a single alice string",
    ", the electric field is double - valued due to the double - valuedness of the @xmath121 generator .",
    "if we introduce a branch cut on a half line , @xmath153 ( see figure [ fig : branchcut ] ) , and consider two branches which are glued together at the cut , the property means that the electric fields on two branches have opposite signs .",
    "thus , the flux integral on a large surface is not well - defined , and we can not define the total charge in the system .",
    "in contrast to an isolated string , we can define a total charge for a pair of an alice string and an anti - alice string ( see figure [ fig:2alice ] ) .        in this case , as we go around a circle which encloses the pair of strings , the @xmath121 generator comes back to the original value since the ( untraced ) wilson loop @xmath154 associated with the alice string is canceled by that associated with the anti - alice string .",
    "namely , an asymptotic observer who never crosses the branch cut is always sitting on one side of the branch , and we can unambiguously define the total electric charge as an integral of the electric flux on the branch .    before we proceed further , we should comment on the definition of the electric field . for convenience ,",
    "we take a unitary gauge in which the asymptotic value of the scalar field becomes constant except for on the branch cut ; @xmath155 . in this",
    "( singular ) gauge , the flipping of @xmath121 generator occurs just above the branch cut .",
    "then , the charge of a particle is invariant as long as it does not cross the cut , and its charge is flipped discontinuously only when it crosses the cut .",
    "we can then define the electric field at a point @xmath156 by measuring the force at @xmath156 felt by a test particle with charge @xmath157 which is taken from an asymptotic region without crossing the branch cut . according to this definition ,",
    "the electric field must change its sign at the branch cut since the force felt by the test particle should not change discontinuously .",
    "now , we can state the notion of cheshire charge .",
    "a cheshire charge is a charge without localized source that appears when a charged particle goes around the alice string . in figure",
    "[ fig : cheshire ] , we sketched how such a charge can appear in the process .",
    "in step ( a ) and ( b ) , a particle with charge @xmath157 is approaching the branch cut from below . in the step from ( b ) to ( c ) , the particle crossed the branch cut and the charge has become @xmath158 . after the configuration described in ( c ) , we take the particle to infinity without crossing the cut .",
    "the resulting configuration is drawn in ( d ) , where there appears non - zero electric flux emanating from the branch cut .",
    "since the branch cut is just an artifact of the singular unitary gauge , there is no localized source of the electric flux .",
    "this kind of charge ( without localized source ) is called a cheshire charge",
    ". the total amount of the cheshire charge can be obtained from a flux integral around the cut , which gives @xmath159 .",
    "thus , the charge conservation law is kept intact in the whole process .          here",
    ", we explain an analogy between defect branes and alice strings , by using the kk - vortex as an example of defect branes .",
    "then , by using the analogy , we discuss the charge transfer process in the kk - vortex background .",
    "if we introduce the generalized metric for the kk - vortex background , it takes the following @xmath80-dependence : @xmath160 by using the same matrix @xmath161 , the charge vector of the rotating probe string at @xmath80 can be written as [ see ] @xmath162 this relation is reminiscent of equation . since the charge vector is non - trivially twisted around the center , the kk vortex ( or general defect branes with non - trivial monodromies ) can be regarded as alice strings .",
    "note that the discrete gauge symmetry @xmath123 ( in the case of the above model of alice strings ) is generalized to u - duality group in the case of string theory .    as is the case with a single alice string",
    ", we do not have a globally well - defined notion of the total winding charge in a kk - vortex background .",
    "however , in this case , it will be natural to define the `` total charge '' by @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the value of the angular variable associated with the @xmath165-th particle .",
    "this definition is essentially the same as that used in @xcite , and , with this definition , the charge of the probe does not change .",
    "indeed , for the case of the rotating probe string , the winding charge of a probe string at @xmath80 is given by @xmath166 [ see ] and @xmath167 is independent of @xmath80 ; i.e. , no @xmath30 charge appears .",
    "however , in the field theoretical analysis performed in section [ sec : charge - transfer ] , the probe produces a non - zero flux associated with the @xmath30 charge during the rotation , and it will be more natural to invent a definition such that the probe charge can change in time .",
    "we thus define the `` total charge '' by @xmath168 conceptually , this definition can be realized by the following procedure .",
    "we first fix a base point on @xmath153 and introduce a curve which encloses all charged particles but does not cross the branch cut ( see figure [ fig : base - point ] ) .",
    ".,width=377 ]    then , by shrinking the curve , we assemble all charged particles to the base point .",
    "now , since all particles have the same basis for the charge vector , we can just add up the components of their charge vectors to compute the `` total charge '' @xmath169 .",
    "with this definition , as is the case of @xmath170 , the charge remains constant during the rotation of a probe string as long as the string does not cross a branch cut .",
    "however , if the probe string crosses the branch cut , its winding charge must discretely change since the matrix discretely jump from @xmath171 to @xmath172 ; @xmath173 that is , if we adopt the definition , the situation is similar to the case where the singular unitary gauge is taken in the presence of alice strings , and the discrete change of the probe charge should be compensated by the cheshire charge , which corresponds to the zero - mode deformation associated with the @xmath14-field .",
    "geometrically , the discrete jump when a probe crossed the branch cut can be realized as a change of coordinates given by .",
    "this is the reason why we did not use the original coordinate @xmath174 but used @xmath175 to calculate the winding number in the introduction . for more general cases where there are multiple probe strings",
    ", it will be more effective to perform an active diffeomorphism @xmath176 when a probe string crosses the branch cut , although the winding number is always measured with the use of the original coordinates .",
    "in this section , we first review the construction of the kk - dyon solution in four - dimensional theory @xcite .",
    "we point out that , if we uplift the solution to ten dimensions , the background has @xmath30 charges although there is no localized source , just like cheshire charges .",
    "we then construct a kk - vortex solution with an arbitrary number of @xmath30 cheshire charges , which we call a dyonic kk vortex , and discuss the relation to the charge transfer process considered in section [ sec : charge - transfer ] .",
    "the kk - monopole solution in ten - dimensional spacetime is given by @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the radius of the @xmath13-direction and @xmath179 satisfies @xmath180 ( @xmath181 : hodge star operator in a flat three - dimensional space ) , which can be solved by @xmath182 compactifying on the six - torus @xmath183 ( spanned by @xmath184 ) , we obtain the four - dimensional configuration : @xmath185 here , @xmath186 is the line element in the four - dimensional einstein frame while @xmath187 is that in the string frame .",
    "now , we make a replacement @xmath188 in the metric and @xmath189 , and use the @xmath190 duality in four dimensions ( see appendix [ app : ele - mag ] ) to obtain the following kk - dyon solution @xcite : @xmath191 we use the following parameterization of the @xmath190 matrix @xcite : @xmath192 where @xmath193 , @xmath194 and @xmath195 are real free parameters to be fixed below . under this @xmath190 transformation ,",
