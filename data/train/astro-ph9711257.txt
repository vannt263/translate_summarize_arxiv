    "supernova remnants have long been invoked as a principal source of galactic cosmic rays , created via the process of diffusive fermi acceleration at their expanding shock fronts ( e.g. drury 1983 , lagage and cesarsky 1983 ) .",
    "they can also provide gamma - ray emission via the interaction of the cosmic ray population with the remnant environment ; this concept was explored recently by drury , aharonian and vlk ( 1994 ) . in their model ,",
    "the gamma - ray luminosity is spawned by collisions between the cosmic rays and nuclei from the ambient snr environment . in the more recent models of mastichiadis and de jager ( 1996 ) , gaisser , protheroe and stanev ( 1997 ) , and sturner ,",
    "et al . ( 1997 ) , @xmath6 and @xmath7 bremsstrahlung , and inverse compton scattering involving shock - accelerated electrons interacting with the cosmic microwave background and also ir / optical emission ( from dust / starlight ) form added components .",
    "see the reviews by de jager and baring ( 1997 ) and vlk ( 1997 , this volume ) for a discussion of various models .    with no definitive detections of gamma - rays from known supernova remnants ,",
    "the motivation for modelling these `` hypothetical '' sources hinges on a handful of spatial associations of unidentified egret sources ( esposito et al .",
    "1996 ) at moderately low galactic latitudes with well - studied radio and x - ray snrs .",
    "these include ic 443 , @xmath0 cygni and w44 , and most have neighbouring dense environments that seem necessary in order to provide sufficient gamma - ray luminosity to exceed egret s sensitivity threshold .",
    "the remnants associated with several of the egret unidentified sources show an apparent absence of tev emission , as determined by whipple ( lessard et al .",
    "1995 , buckley et al .",
    "1997 ) , which could be explained by an intrinsic cutoff in the snr - generated cosmic ray distribution ( e.g. mastichiadis and de jager 1996 ) .",
    "all of the above models invoke simple power - law accelerated particle populations . in this paper , we utilize the more sophisticated output of shock acceleration simulations ( e.g. jones and ellison 1991 ) to address the issues of spectral curvature and the maximum energy of acceleration in the context of snr gamma - ray emission .",
    "we use output from the fully non - linear , steady - state monte carlo simulations of ellison , baring and jones ( 1996 ) to describe the accelerated particles in environments where they influence the dynamics of the snr shell .",
    "our results make clear predictions of what maximum energies of gamma - rays are expected and more accurate predictions of the level of tev emission in these sources .",
    "our model provides a prescription for defining realistic values of the non - thermal electron / proton abundance ratio .",
    "shock acceleration is usually assumed in astrophysical models to generate power - law particle populations .",
    "this approximation omits the effect the accelerated particles themselves have on the hydrodynamics of their shocked environment .",
    "such non - linear effects , well - documented in the reviews of drury ( 1983 ) and jones and ellison ( 1991 ) , have a feedback on the acceleration mechanism and its efficiency .",
    "the slope of the cosmic ray distributions depends purely on the compression ratio of flow speeds either side of the shock , and this ratio ultimately depends on the shape of the ion distributions . our kinematic monte carlo technique ( see ellison , baring and jones 1996 ) for simulation of fermi acceleration in the non - linear regime is ideal for fully exploring particle populations , acceleration efficiencies and spectral properties .",
    "the simulation follows particle convection and diffusion in the shock environs using a simple scattering law : a particle s mean free path is proportional to its gyroradius",
    ". generalizations of this law are easily handled by the monte carlo simulation .    clearly",
    "the maximum energy of fermi - accelerated ions is of central importance to tev observations .",
    "it can be determined in the sedov phase by equating the acceleration time to the remnant age , producing values of the order of ( see baring et al .",
    "1997 ) : @xmath8 where is the field in units of gauss , is the expansion speed , and . in the sedov phase , where the peak luminosity is expected ( see drury , aharonian and vlk 1994 ) , is actually a slowly increasing function of time ( see baring et al .",
    "1997 ) . for young snrs early in the sedov phase ( yrs ) ,",
    "typically km / sec , implying age - limited acceleration terminating at around tev .",
    "the diffusion scale of the snr medium is for a diffusion coefficient of , so that eq .",
    "( 1 ) generally guarantees that maximum diffusion lengths are always considerably smaller than the shock radius .    typical simulation output",
    "is shown in fig .  1 , where the resulting ion and @xmath9 distributions are exhibited .",
    "the pressure of the accelerated ions ( @xmath10 and he@xmath11 ) acts to slow down the fast - moving flow upstream of the shock , creating a maximum compression ratio @xmath12 that is much greater than the canonical `` strong shock '' value of 4 .",
    "such large @xmath12 are realized at the largest scales , implying an increased `` efficiency '' of accelerating higher energy particles than those at lower energies .",
    "hence upward curvature appears ( e.g. see baring et al .",
    "1997 ) in the proton , and electron distributions : high energy particles have longer mean - free paths and therefore typically influence the flow on larger scalelengths .",
    "the escape of particles upstream of the shock ( i.e. outside of the remnant s shell ) , which occurs on a timescale of , gives a cessation of acceleration , in this case at tev energies , forcing the compression ratio to increase to compensate in the flow hydrodynamics .",
    "these non - linear predictions of the spectrum differ significantly from the test - particle case ( ellison , baring and jones 1996 ) , with deviations from power - law behaviour by as much as a factor of around 3 over four decades in particle energy : this is a significant influence on predictions of tev fluxes in gamma - ray snrs .",
    "in applying the full non - linear monte carlo simulation to the prediction of snr @xmath0-ray emission , we model the decay component , bremsstrahlung and inverse compton scattering of background radiation fields .",
    "cosmic ray ions collide with nuclei in the cold ambient ism to produce s , which subsequently decay to create two photons ; the decay spectra were calculated much along the lines of the work of dermer ( 1986 ) .",
    "bremsstrahlung and inverse compton contributions were calculated along the standard lines used in gaisser , protheroe and stanev ( 1998 ) and sturner et al .",
    "2 shows the emergent @xmath0-ray spectra resulting from particle distributions ( similar to those in fig .",
    "1 ) generated by the non - linear monte carlo simulation . the non - linear modifications can alter the tev / egret flux ratio by as much as a factor of 23 ( baring , ellison and grenier 1997 ) . in this case",
    ", ions are accelerated out to around a few tev per nucleon , providing compatibility with the whipple upper limits .",
    "turnovers at such low energies are not predicted in the work of gaisser , protheroe and stanev ( 1998 ) , but are invoked by mastichiadis and de jager ( 1996 ) , and sturner et al .",
    "one implication of such low maximum energies for cosmic rays may be that gamma - ray snrs are a gamma - ray bright minority of the remnant population , with other snrs being required to produce the bulk of cosmic rays out to the `` knee . ''",
    "validity of such a contention would be contingent upon a confirmation that at least some of the egret unidentified sources in esposito et al .",
    "( 1996 ) represent detections of shell - related emission .",
    "alternatively , such emission may be common but at flux levels below egret s sensitivity , awaiting future detections ; such a scenario might permit most shell - type @xmath0-ray remnants to simultaneously be prolific producers of cosmic rays .    some features of the model results illustrated in fig",
    ".  2 together with a collection of data for ic 443 that are immediately apparent are that ( i ) the low density chosen ( following gaisser , protheroe and stanev 1998 ) inhibits pion decay emission , compared with the high densities inferred by drury , aharonian and vlk ( 1994 ) in matching egret flux sensitivities , ( ii ) the strong contribution of the bremsstrahlung in hard gamma - rays generates a spectrum steep enough to be compatible with the egret source spectral index , and ( iii ) the 110 tev - range turnovers in the particle distributions provide total consistency of the radiation spectrum with whipple and hegra upper limits .",
    "this last feature refutes recent suggestions that the upper limits obtained by whipple to ic 443 are so constraining that they cause serious problems for the fermi mechanism ( see baring 1997 , and de jager and baring 1997 , for more detailed discussions ) . scaling up the source distance and volume in the figure emphasizes the suitability of this particular model for the gamma - rays , but provides inconsistencies with the radio and ginga x - ray data .",
    "hence shock acceleration can comfortably accommodate the gamma - ray data points , and modification of snr parameters to reduce the relative importance of bremsstrahlung can yield compatibility with the x - ray data ( discussed in baring et al .",
    "1997 ) . the flat radio synchrotron spectral index poses more of a problem ( see baring et al . 1997 ) .",
    "we note that the localization of egret gamma - rays from ic 443 in esposito et al .",
    "( 1996 ) is entirely consistent with a shell origin , in contrast to the more confining localizations available for @xmath0-cygni ( brazier et al .",
    "1996 , discussed in de jager and baring 1997 ) . for this reason , we view ic 443 as a better candidate for comparing models with gamma - ray data .",
    "one important aspect of our work is the connection we make between properties of thermal and suprathermal electrons and the resulting @xmath13/@xmath10 ratio .",
    "we inject electrons as `` test particles '' at temperature , which is usually in the kev range ( see fig .",
    "1 ) so as ( i ) to be compatible with temperatures deduced from x - ray observations , and ( ii ) to mimic a shock dissipation that deposits a sizeable fraction of the proton rankine - hugoniot thermal energy into the electron population . furthermore , we define a critical energy , above which electrons efficiently resonate with alfvn - whistler modes ( with ) , and below which electron diffusion is inefficient , as is expected at suprathermal energies due to wave damping .",
    "these choices define a range of possibilities that describe how electrons are injected into the fermi process .",
    "electrons `` injected '' at lower energies ( i.e. lower and ) have shorter mean free paths , and consequently steeper spectra .",
    "hence these parameters determine the value of the @xmath13/@xmath10 ratio at 1 gev ( and above ) which was around 0.7 for the case exhibited in fig .  2 ( which had k and kev ) .",
    "generally , our models produce ( see baring et al .",
    "1997 ) @xmath13/@xmath10 ratios considerably less than unity ( e.g. see fig .  1 ) , which are consistent with cosmic ray abundances ( e.g. mller et al .",
    "1995 ) and modelling of the diffuse @xmath0-ray background ( hunter et al .",
    "1997 ) , but provide worse fits of the gamma - ray data for ic 443 that are depicted in fig .  2 .",
    "the shape of the gamma - ray spectrum below 1 gev is strongly dependent on the @xmath13/@xmath10 ratio above 1 gev . we believe that electron diffusion in turbulent plasmas favours lower injection energies .",
    "consequently , we contend that lower levels ( than in fig .  2 ) of inverse compton and bremsstrahlung emission relative to pion decay radiation are far more likely ( contrasting sturner et al .",
    "1997 ) to be representative of @xmath0-rays from snrs .",
    "notwithstanding , for electrons and protons accelerated to similar energies above 30 tev , inverse compton scattering is a more efficient creator of super - tev gamma - rays , and is expected ( mastichiadis and de jager 1996 ) to dominate such signals from sources like sn1006 .",
    "the recent detections of sn1006 by the cangaroo experiment above 1.2 tev , announced at this meeting ( see tanimori et al . , these proceedings ) , have ushered in a new era for supernova remnant studies .",
    "in conclusion , the non - linear effects addressed here are desirable input to any model that invokes fermi acceleration at snrs .",
    "they produce cutoffs in the spectrum that can comfortably accommodate whipple s tev upper limits to unidentified egret sources , and provide a range of realistic estimates of the non - thermal @xmath13/@xmath10 ratio .",
    "it is clear that if some of the egret detections turn out to be of gamma - rays generated in the environs of remnant shells , then gamma - ray emitters must be a minority of remnants , perhaps mostly young , given that they can not produce ions above around a few tev in profusion .",
    "remnants that provide cosmic rays up to the knee must consequently be a gamma - ray quiet majority .",
    "alternatively , if fluxes of shell origin are well below egret s and whipple s flux sensitivities , then the notion that shell - type remnants are simultaneously gamma - ray bright and prolific producers of cosmic rays becomes tenable .",
    "it has therefore become evident that the whipple and hegra upper limits have not destroyed the hypothesis that shocks in shell - type remnants energize the particles responsible for the gamma - ray emission , but rather have provided a powerful tool for constraining our understanding .",
    "given the recent detections of sn1006 by cangaroo , we expect that in the near future , coupled tev / sub - gev , mev and x - ray observations will discriminate between the various models , and refine our understanding of gamma - ray snrs ."
