    "however , since we solve a set of ideal mhd equations in which magnetic reconnection happens due to the numerical resistivity , we ignore the electric field generated by finite resistivity in the simulation of crs . in reality , the electric field generated at reconnection site is expected to enhance the particle acceleration in mri turbulence . to include this effect , the mhd simulation that includes the resistivity model based on collision - less plasma physics",
    "is required , which is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the effect of back reaction by crs on the non - linear evolution for mri is not well understood .",
    "@xcite analyze the linear growth of mri including the effect of cr diffusion .",
    "they show that the cr diffusion barely affects the linear growth of mri in shearing box calculation , even if the cr pressure is comparable to the thermal pressure .",

    "close to ideal mhd , the saturation level is supposed to be determined by the parasitic instability of kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) modes that induce the dissipation by magnetic reconnection @xcite .",
    "since the growth rate of kh instability is modified by crs if they have comparable energy density to the thermal particles @xcite , crs probably affect the saturation level of mri turbulence . to investigate it , three dimensional mhd simulations including the back reaction by crs are necessary ( cf .",
    "although we assume that the thermal component is described by the mhd formalism , it is unclear whether the collisionless plasma is described by mhd . as an alternative way to describe the collisionless plasma in accretion flows ,",
    "@xcite used the anisotropic mhd formalism where the plasma has anisotropic pressure . in this formalism , as the magnetic field becomes strong , the pressure anisotropy increases , which suppresses the growth of mri @xcite . in reality , the thermal particles are expected to be isotropized by some plasma instabilities such as the mirror mode , so that the pressure anisotropy decreases .",
    "this allows mri to grow up in non - linear regime , which is confirmed by the recent pic simulations with the shearing box approximation @xcite .",
    "however , as noted in section [ sec : intro ] , there is the scale gap between the gyro scales of electrons and the scale heights of accretion flows .",
    "the hybrid simulations , in which we treat protons as particles and electrons as a fluid , may be useful for investigating larger scale turbulences with the kinetic effects ( cf .",
    "* ) , but it is currently difficult to bridge the scale gap completely .",
    "we have investigated the stochastic particle acceleration process in accretion flows .",
    "the crs are likely to exist inside accretion flows when the mass accretion rate is sufficiently lower than the eddington rate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the existence of crs is expected by the theoretical estimate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and modeling of the observed photon spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the gamma - rays from accretion flows are not detected yet @xcite .",
    "we have calculated the orbits of crs as test particles in turbulent fields generated by mri with the shearing box approximation . within this approximation ,",
    "when a cr particle crosses the box boundary in the @xmath15 direction , it changes energy as measured in the box frame .",
    "sufficiently energetic crs that can cross the box boundary in the x direction many times without changing the direction of motion tend to increase their energies in a runaway manner .",
    "we have avoided this artificial acceleration by introducing the escape boundaries : the crs crossing them are allowed to escape from the system . from our simulations",
    ", we have found that the energies of crs randomly change .",
    "some lucky crs continuously increase their energies , and reach several times higher energies than their initial energies after @xmath131 .",
    "the crs anisotropically diffuse in the configuration space .",
    "since the magnetic field is stretched mainly in the @xmath14 direction , the diffusion coefficients satisfy @xmath42 .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath38 is consistent with the bohm coefficient , and we can approximately write @xmath132 and @xmath48 .    we have also shown that the evolution of distribution function is described by the diffusion equation in momentum space ( equation [ eq : diffusion ] ) .",
    "the diffusion coefficient in momentum space can be fitted by a power - law form , @xmath133 . both @xmath85 and @xmath75",
    "depend on the initial momentum @xmath122 .",
    "although the shear acceleration is efficient for sufficiently energetic particles , quantitative understanding of the acceleration mechanism in our simulation is not complete . to apply our simulation results to astrophysical objects , e.g. calculating the spectrum of non - thermal protons and",
    "predict the neutrino and gamma - ray fluxes more precisely than those in @xcite , we need to understand the acceleration process and the dependence of @xmath63 on physical quantities .    we thank masahiro hoshino , jun kakuwa , yutaka ohira , ryo yamazaki , daisuke nakauchi , and sanemichi takahashi for fruitful discussion .",
