    "first revealed by the einstein observatory ( see e.g. @xcite ) , point - like , off - nuclear x - ray sources with luminosities significantly in excess of the eddington limit for one solar mass have been discovered in a large number of nearby galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the nature of most of these ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) remains unclear .",
    "in several cases a variability on timescales of months / years has been detected , a possible signature of an accreting compact object . were these sources x - ray binaries in the host galaxy , and assuming eddington - limited accretion ,",
    "masses in the range 100 - 1000 @xmath1 are inferred from the observed flux .",
    "the central object would be then an intermediate mass black hole ( imbh ) .",
    "mass estimates based on the eddington limit are , however , questionable : these sources need not to be spherically symmetric , nor stationary .",
    "it has been proposed that many of the ulx properties can be explained assuming that they do not emit isotropically @xcite or are dominated by emission from a relativistic jet ( e.g. @xcite ) . in this case",
    ", they may harbor stellar mass bhs and may be similar to galactic black - hole binaries .",
    "the available _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ observations show that , for sources with sufficiently good statistics , the best fit of the x - ray spectrum is often obtained with a two - component model : an absorbed multicolor disk ( mcd)+power - law .",
    "some ulxs have mcd temperatures @xmath2 ev , much lower than in galactic bh binaries .",
    "since @xmath3 , the low temperature of the soft component has been taken as further evidence for the presence of an imbh of @xmath4 1001000 @xmath1 in some ulxs @xcite .",
    "a few sources have a temperature above 1 kev , higher than that of galactic bh candidates , but still in the range of galactic microquasars .",
    "optical counterparts of ulxs have been studied by a number of authors ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "several ulxs are associated with optical emission nebulae of a few hundred parsecs in diameter , whose properties are consistent with those of x - ray irradiated nebulae @xcite .",
    "another approach to study the nature of ulxs is through time variability .",
    "the analysis of the aperiodic variability in the x - ray flux of x - ray binaries is a powerful tool to study the properties of the inner regions of the accretion disk around compact objects ( for a review see @xcite ) . in particular , quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos )",
    "provide well - defined frequencies , which can be linked to specific time scales in the disk .",
    "qpos can be broadly divided into three classes : ( a ) qpos at very low frequencies ( @xmath50.02 hz ) , probably associated to oscillations and instabilities in the accretion disk ( see @xcite ) ; ( b ) low - frequency ( lf ) qpos , with typical frequencies between 0.1 and 10 hz , probably connected to similar oscillations in neutron star systems ( see e.g. @xcite ) , over whose origin there is no consensus ; in black hole candidates ( bhcs ) 3 main different types of lf qpos have been identified ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) ) ; ( c ) `` hecto - hertz '' qpos , with a typical frequency of 100 - 300 hz , in two cases observed to appear in pairs @xcite .",
    "it is currently unclear whether these qpos show a constant frequency for each source ( see @xcite ) , and whether they do appear in pairs obeying particular frequency ratios ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , since they identify the highest frequencies observed in these systems , they are the best candidates for association with , e.g. , the keplerian frequency at the innermost stable orbit , or relativistic precession frequencies .",
    "whatever their physical nature , as they originate in the inner regions of accretion disks around black holes , these features are expected to be produced also in ulxs .",
    "however , if ulxs contain imbhs of 100 - 1000 @xmath1 , the frequencies involved are much smaller .",
    "the first and , to date , only ulx where a qpo has been discovered is m82 x-1 @xcite . the qpo has a frequency of 54.4 mhz and a fwhm of 11.4 mhz , leading to a quality value @xmath6 5 .",
    "the total fractional rms of the qpo in the 2 - 10 kev band is 8.4% .",
    "recently , @xcite reported the identification of another qpo at 106 mhz in the power spectrum of m82 x-1 from _ rossixte _ data , arguing that it may be a harmonic of the qpo at 54 mhz .    here",
    "we report the results from a joint spectral and timing analysis of a 105 ks _ xmm - newton _ observation of m82 x-1 performed in april 2004 and of archival _ rossixte _ observations of the same field .",
    "the new _ xmm _ data are part of a pointing to m82 , originally requested to study the enrichment of the galactic interstellar medium ( ranalli et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following .",
    "in  [ spec ] we present the spectral analysis of the new _ xmm _ observation and a re - analysis of the data by @xcite .",

    "slightly different good time intervals were used for the spectral and timing analysis , as specified below .",

    "the nearest sources could not be eliminated in this way .",
    "another strong source of background contamination , especially at low energies , is the host galaxy itself .",

    "we try to perform spectral fits of the _ xmm _ data in the [ 0.8 - 10 ] kev range and therefore perform subtraction of the host galaxy diffuse emission .",
    "the background was extracted from an annulus of inner and outer radii of 18 and 35@xmath8 , respectively , eliminating the contribution of sources 1 , 8 and 9 of @xcite in a way similar to that described above .",

    "standard interstellar absorption ( wabs ) was taken into account and an overall normalization constant was used to minimize residual detector calibration uncertainties .",
    "results of the spectral fits with various models are reported in table [ tab : m82reg ] .",
    "the spectrum is rather composite , so that fits with single component models do not give satisfactory results .",

    "m82 x-1 is one of the best studied ulxs .",
    "it suffers from huge contamination in the soft x - rays from the diffuse emission of the host galaxy , the starburst prototype m82 @xcite . despite the care in subtracting the contribution of this emission ,",
    "a residual contamination is present in the spectra .",
    "we modelled this emission with a 3-mekal model with different absorbing columns .",
    "the third mekal component at high temperature can account for the he - like fe excess emission in the spectrum , suggesting that it may originate from the diffuse emission in m82 and not from the ulx .",
    "the upper limit to the flux of a line at @xmath55 kev in the 2001 xmm observation is consistent with the line flux measured in the 2004 xmm observation . since in 2001",

    "this result appears to be consistent with the absence of line flux variability and then with a galactic origin .",
    "however , it should be noted that the very high column density of the third mekal component may represent a problem for this interpretation , although absorption columns as high as @xmath56 @xmath33 are reported in not - dissimilar galaxies @xcite .    the hri instrument on board _ chandra _ allowed @xcite to resolve the central part of the galaxy , revealing the presence of a number of point sources in addition to m82 x-1 ( the _ chandra _ source cxom82 j095550.2 + 694047 , labelled source 7 by @xcite ) .",

    "although we are aware that for _ xmm _ this is not as effective as for _ chandra _ ( because a region of 5@xmath8 corresponds to a",
    "_ xmm _ encircled energy fraction of about 30 - 50% ) , this appears to be a reasonable compromise between minimizing the contamination from these sources and preserving the counting statistics of m82 x-1 .",
    "this procedure could not be adopted to eliminate the contribution from the three nearest sources to m82 x-1 ( 4 , 5 and 6 in @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , source 5 is highly variable . in the _ chandra _ observation of october 1999",
    "the count rate of this source was only 30% of that of m82 x-1 .",
    "later , the former decreased by an order of magnitude while the latter increased by a factor @xmath4 7 . therefore , while sources 4 and 6 are roughly constant and weak with respect to m82 x-1 , significant contamination from source 5 can not be ruled out .",
    "a number of ulxs show very soft spectral components well fitted by a mcd model , representing emission from an accretion disk .",
    "our best fit includes a soft mcd component with temperature @xmath58=0.18 kev .",
    "a plot of the @xmath59 contours for @xmath60 vs. normalisation of the mcd component shows that the temperature is well constrained while , within 3@xmath61 , the normalization varies between @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( xspec units ; best fit value 1745 ) .",
    "although this is a large variation , the lower bound makes the detection of the mcd component quite robust . adding this component results in a statistical improvement of the fit .",
    "however , although a 3-mekal model with different absorbing columns offers a fair representation of the starbust diffuse emission , it is not possible to rule out completely a residual contamination at very soft energies from the host galaxy . under the assumption that the softest emission is entirely due to an accretion disk",
    ", the temperature of the mcd fit ( @xmath64 ) can be used to estimate the bh mass .",
    "we note that such an interpretation in terms of a standard accretion disk does not encounter the severe inconsistencies that are found when a similar hypothesis is applied to the soft excess in agns ( see @xcite ) . assuming that @xmath64 represents an estimate of the maximum temperature of a standard accretion disk , it is @xmath65 , with @xmath66 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if the disk terminates at the innermost stable circular orbit of a schwarzschild bh , the expression for the bh mass then becomes : @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is a color correction factor @xcite .",
    "assuming eddington limited accretion , the bh mass is @xmath69 , roughly in agreement with the value inferred from the x - ray flux .",
    "m82 x-1 is at present the only ulx where a qpo has been discovered .",
    "there are a total of 9 detections , two of which in the _ xmm _ data and seven in the _ rxte _ data , with frequencies in the range @xmath450 - 170 mhz .",
    "an important issue is of course the possible identification of this qpo with one of the qpo types observed in the x - ray light curves of stellar - mass bhcs . in the following",
    "we will summarize the main properties of the qpo in m82 x-1 , and discuss its similarities and differences with the qpos observed in bhcs .",
    "* the lowest and highest observed frequencies are @xmath70 mhz and @xmath71 respectively ( see figure [ fig : rxte ] ) . *",
    "the frequency distribution over this range is suggestive of a harmonic 1:2:3 ratio between them .",
    "* in the 2004 _ xmm _ observation the frequency is observed to vary by a factor of @xmath410% in less than one day . *",
    "the qpo peak has a quality value higher than 4 ( up to @xmath46 in one case ) . *",
    "it shows a high fractional rms ( up to @xmath418% ) . *",
    "the underlying band limited noise is strong ( fractional rms @xmath422% ) and has a characteristic frequency comparable to the qpo frequency .",
    "* the integrated fractional rms of the qpo above 4 kev is higher than below that energy .",
    "let us compare now all these properties with those of the various types of qpos observed in bhcs .",
    "* _ very - low frequency qpos . _",
    "an association of the qpo in m82 x-1 with the very low frequency ( @xmath72 hz ) `` heart - beat '' qpos observed in grs 1915 + 105 is unlikely as their frequency is _",
    "lower_. this , assuming an inverse scaling with the black - hole mass , would imply a very low ( @xmath4solar ) mass black hole in m82 x-1 , which is not in agreement with the spectral evidences . * _ high - frequency qpos . _",
    "the observed short - time scale variability seems to exclude an association with the high - frequency `` hecto - hertz '' qpos observed in bhcs , since the latter have been detected at rather stable frequencies .",
    "however , it is worth noticing that , assuming a @xmath73 scaling factor between the two phenomena , the @xmath74 mhz variation of the centroid frequency on a time scale of @xmath4 30 ks observed in m82 x-1 would correspond to a @xmath74 hz variation on a time scale of @xmath4 30 s in a 10 solar mass bhc .",
    "such a short time scale variability is impossible to detect in bhcs with the present instrumentation . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of a strong underlying band limited noise , with a characteristic frequency comparable to the qpo frequency , is clearly at variance with the high - frequency `` hecto - hertz''qpos observed in bhcs .",
    "furthermore , the rms amplitude of the qpo itself in m82 x-1 is roughly an order of magnitude bigger than that of the `` hecto - hertz '' qpos in bhcs , thus making the association very unlikely . for the sake of completeness",
    "we stress that the detection of the qpo at @xmath4 166 mhz reported in this paper lowers the upper limit for the mass of the black hole in m82 x-1 ( assuming that this frequency is associated with the keplerian frequency at the innermost circular orbit around a schwarzschild black hole ) to @xmath75 . *",
    "_ low - frequency qpos .",
    "_ three main types of low - frequency qpos are observed in bhcs ( see @xcite ) . in two of them ,",
    "the type - a and the type - b qpos , the peak appears always at frequencies near 8 and 6 hz respectively .",
    "moreover , they are both characterized by a weak ( a few % ) underlying red noise component .",
    "these properties make an association with the variable , strong qpo observed in m82 x-1 unlikely . in the case of type",
    "- a qpos , its low coherence and amplitude make the association even less likely .",
    "+ the properties of the qpo in m82 x-1 are on the contrary reminiscent of those of the third type of bhcs low - frequency qpo , the type c , whose characteristic frequencies vary in the range 0.1 - 15 hz .",
    "the similarities in fractional rms , variability , quality value , and underlying noise strongly suggest an association between the two features .",
    "furthermore , in the 2004 _ xmm _ observation there is evidence for a positive correlation of the qpo frequency with the count - rate , and a similar correlation is often observed in type - c qpos . however , during the 2001 _ xmm _ observation ( when the qpo was detected at a lower frequency ) the count rate was higher than during the 2004 observation . since the count - rate vs. frequency correlation in bhcs is `` outburst dependent '' ( which means that during different outburst a source can show similar frequencies at different count - rates ) no conclusion can be derived from the observed phenomenology in m82 x-1 .",
    "no information on the count - rate variability could be obtained from the _ rxte _ observations , given the lack of imaging capabilities of the satellite .",
    "assuming that the qpo detected in m82 x-1 is a type - c qpo , and scaling the frequency inversely to the bh mass , the observed frequency range ( from 50 to 166 mhz ) would yield @xmath76 anywhere in the range 10 - 1000 @xmath1 .",
    "however , type - c qpos are observed in bhcs throughout the whole hard - intermediate state ( see @xcite ) , and their frequency is known to decrease with the hardness of the energy spectrum . at the lowest observed frequencies , the spectrum is hard and there is often no evidence for the presence of a soft thermal component .",
    "as the contribution from a disk appears and increases , the qpo frequency also increases .",
    "the _ xmm _ spectra of both observations in which a qpo has been detected in m82 x-1 show possible evidence for a disk contribution ( see before ) . to the extent",
    "that the two phenomena can be compared , the presence of a soft component would exclude that the type - c qpo in m82 x-1 is in the lowest frequency range , increasing the lower limit for @xmath76 .",
    "in this paper we reported a complete analysis of _ xmm - newton _ and _ rxte _ observations of the superluminal x - ray source m82 x-1 .",
    "the similarities in fractional rms , variability , quality value , and underlying noise strongly suggest an association between the qpo in m82 x-1 and the low - frequency , type - c qpos observed in bhcs .",
    "the combined spectral and timing analysis allows us for the first time to put strong constrains to the mass of the central black hole in this source , yielding to a value between a few tens to one thousand solar masses .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for valuable comments .",
