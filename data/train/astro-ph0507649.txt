    "the availability of very efficient high - resolution spectrographs on 810 meter class telescopes ( vogt et al .",
    "1994 , dodorico et al , 2000 ) provided the very high s / n observations of high redshift quasars needed to confirm earlier suggestions ( e.g. meyer & york 1987 ) that many of the stronger lines seen in the lyman alpha forest of quasar spectra have associated metal absorption lines ( cowie et al .",
    "1995 , tytler et al .",
    "1995 ) . over the past few years these metal features have been extensively studied using voigt profile fitting ( e.g. songaila & cowie 1996 ; songaila 1998 ; ellison et al .",
    "2000 ; songaila 2001 ; pichon et al .  2003 ; simcoe , sargent & rauch 2004 ; aracil et al .",
    "2004 ) and the so - called pixel optical depth ( pod ) methods in which the metal - line optical depths are cross - correlated with neutral hydrogen absorption ( cowie & songaila 1998 ; songaila 1998 ; aguirre , schaye & theuns 2002 ; schaye et al .  2003 ;",
    "aguirre et al .",
    "down to the sensitivity limit of these methods ( @xmath12 ) metal enrichment seems ubiquitous , with a median value of @xmath13 } = -3.47 $ ]  at an overdensity of @xmath14 , though there is a considerable spread of nearly a dex in the metallicity at every overdensity and an equally significant trend with overdensity ( shaye et al .",
    "it also appears that there is very little change in the distribution of absorbers over a very wide redshift range ( songaila 2001 ) .",
    "the origin of these metals is still unclear : some may be in the process of being injected into the igm from galaxies at the redshifts in question ( we refer to this as contemporary injection ) ( adelberger et al .",
    "2003 , pettini et al .",
    "2003 ) , whereas others may have been put in place by earlier galaxy formation or by generations of population iii stars ( wasserburg & qian 2000 ; madau , ferrara & rees 2001 ; qian , sargent & wasserburg 2002 ; bromm , yoshida & hernquist 2003 ; venkatesan & truran 2003 ; mackey , bromm & hernqist 2003 ; fujita et al .",
    "2004 ; daigne et al .",
    "2004 ; yoshida , bromm & hernquist 2004 ) .",
    "it is very likely that both processes contribute , and one of the primary goals of the present series of papers is to see if we can distinguish among systems formed by the various processes and determine if the enrichment mechanism relates to intrinsic properties of the metal systems such as their column density , velocity structure , or redshift .",
    "an essential prerequisite of these analyses is , however , the existence of extremely high signal - to - noise observations of the quasars . over the past years we have been obtaining very long - exposure spectra of the brightest quasars accessible with the hires and esi spectrographs on the keck 10-m telescope . in this set of papers we describe these observations and then use them to reanalyse the properties of the forest metals . in this first paper",
    "we describe a more objective technique for analyzing the spectra which allows us to make a deeper analysis of the data than is possible with voigt profile fitting .",
    "in two subsequent papers we will use this method to address two of the outstanding problems associated with igm metal enrichment scenarios , namely what fraction of the absorbers lie in galatic wind outflows ( paper ii ) and what metallicity is associated with regions of lyman alpha optical depth , @xmath15  ( paper iii ) .",
    "voigt profile fitting is an inherently subjective procedure , both in the initial visual selection of the line candidates and also in the choice of cloud model to fit the line .",
    "the errors and incompleteness are therefore hard to quantify .",
    "the current pod methods , while extremely sensitive and objectively quantifiable , are sensitive only to metal lines with other counterparts , either other metal lines , or , more usually , strong hydrogen lines , and also suffer in those cases in which the velocity structure of the metal lines differs markedly from that of the counterpart line .",
    "therefore we need a new technique to analyse the absorption structure that allows us to objectively analyse the metal data alone and to probe to the deepest possible levels that the data allow . in this paper",
    "we develop a new method that relies only on the doublet itself .",
    "the primary metal absorption features outside of the forest in high - redshift quasar spectra are and lines and the fact that these are doublets , and nearly all unsaturated lines , suggests an approach to this problem . in this paper",
    "we describe a pixel optical depth technique in which we analyse the spectra by looking for regions where the optical depths at the relative wavelengths of the doublet approximate the expected 2:1 ratio ; we call this the superposed pixel optical depth , or `` superpod '' method .",
    "we show ( @xmath16 ) how incompleteness of the selection arising from noise and line overlap can be quantified , and how the completeness correction can be modelled by adding artificial lines to the spectra . the overall analysis , which parallels the methods used to generate number counts in images , allows us to probe a factor of about 0.5 dex deeper in the absorption line structure than the conventional techniques .",
    "however , even more importantly , the method is fully automatic and therefore biases and incompleteness can be handled properly .",
    "we also show ( @xmath17 ) how the conventional analysis can be reproduced by a percolation analysis of the optical depth results .",
    "finally ( @xmath18 ) we use the data to reanalyse the evolution of the absorption with redshift , and confirm the result that there is little evolution of the distribution of the absorbers over the @xmath19 redshift range .",
    "we assume throughout a standard @xmath20cdm cosmology with @xmath21 , @xmath22  and @xmath23 .",
    "the quasar observations are summarized in table 1 .",
    "all of the @xmath24 quasars were observed with the hires spectrograph on the kecki 10 m telescope ( vogt et al .",
    "1994 ) using the red cross disperser .",
    "nearly all of the observations were taken prior to the replacement of the hires ccds in 2004 but after the installation of the rotator , which allowed the observations to be made at the paralactic angle .",
    "a @xmath25 slit width was used , giving a measured resolution of 39,000 .",
    "multiple spectrograph settings were used to give complete wavelength coverage and observations spread over a number of years , from the first use of hires in 1994 to the present , were combined to give the final spectra .",
    "the @xmath26 quasars were observed with the lower resolution esi spectrograph ( sheinis et al .",
    "2000 ) on the keckii 10 m telescope .",
    "the slit width of @xmath27 gives a resolution of @xmath28 .",
    "all of the reductions were carried out using an idl software package written by the author .",
    "more details can be found in songaila ( 2001 ; esi ) and songaila ( 1998 ; hires ) .",
    "the individual spectra and associated noise and sky files can be found at the website _",
    "@xmath29 acowie/ spectra.html_. in each case we have quantified the quality of the spectrum by the signal - to - noise measured in a velocity interval of @xmath30 at two rest wavelengths ( 1250 and 1400@xmath31 ) in the quasar frame .",
    "the final signal - to - noise values measured in each of the spectra are shown in table 1 . the five spectra with highest quality",
    "had signal - to - noise values near or above 200 in this interval and are marked with an h in the table .",
    "we refer to this as the core quasar sample .",
    "these quasars have emission redshifts from 2.72 to 3.62 .",
    "we restrict our analysis to absorption lines that lie more than @xmath32  longward of the quasar s @xmath33 emission and whose redshift is more than @xmath34 blueward of the quasar redshift ; this avoids contamination by the @xmath33 forest and any absorption associated with the quasar itself .",
    "the continuum was locally fit with a 7th order polynomial , iterating to remove absorption features , and the optical depth versus wavelength constructed through the chosen wavelength region for each quasar .",
    "an upper limit of @xmath35  was imposed where regions were saturated .",
    "the optical depth vectors were smoothed to prevent over - sampling . a @xmath36  boxcar smoothing was chosen , which roughly matches the half widths of features seen in the metal forest .",
    "a sample region of an optical depth vector can be found in figure  [ fig : selec ] .",
    "the distribution of optical depths in the core quasar sample is shown in figure  [ fig : distrib ] . in the selected wavelength region ,",
    "3.4% of the pixels in the optical depth vectors in the core sample have optical depths above 0.1 and about a third lie above 0.005 .",
    "much of this structure is produced by , but there are contributions also from , and lower ionization lines as well as incompletely removed telluric features , continuum fitting errors , etc .",
    "the total optical depth can be used to provide an upper estimate of @xmath37 .",
    "features with @xmath38 correspond to @xmath39  in the five quasars of the core sample .",
    "much of this comes from higher optical depth regions ; @xmath40  gives a contribution to this number of @xmath41 .",
    "portions of the spectrum with @xmath42  give @xmath43 .",
    "as we shall subsequently show , slightly more than @xmath44  of the total absorption comes from the doublets .",
    "the doublet structure of the , and lines can now be used to reduce the contamination by other lines or artifacts . for each wavelength position in the optical depth vector",
    "we can look at the corresponding wavelength position of the second member of the doublet and see if the optical depth is in the correct ratio of roughly 2:1 .",
    "we can then restrict the optical depth vector to positions where the condition is satisfied and set the remaining positions of the vector to zero .",
    "we refer to this final vector as the cleaned optical depth .",
    "in general the measured doublet ratio will only approximate the true value because of noise , errors in the continuum fit , line contamination , etc . , and we need to specify a selection parameter , that is , the range of acceptable ratios , which we refer to as the doublet ratio window . too wide a choice of window will result in overselection of false positive signal whereas too narrow a choice will eliminate too many real systems , especially at low optical depth .",
    "we have chosen a doublet ratio window of 1:1 to 4:1 in the present work .",
    "we will discuss reasons for this choice below .",
    "the procedure is illustrated in figure  [ fig : selec ] .",
    "the bottom panel shows the @xmath45  optical depth as a function of wavelength for a @xmath46  sample of spectrum , with one strong line . in the middle panel the @xmath47  optical depth is shown in the rest frame of the @xmath48  line .",
    "both vectors are individually smoothed as previously described .",
    "finally , in the top panel , the result of the optical depth selection criterion of @xmath49 is shown and confirms the strong system as a real doublet while removing much of the weaker structure seen in the raw @xmath48  optical depth vector .",
    "figure  [ fig : tramon ] shows the procedure in a different way .",
    "here we have plotted on the x - axis the @xmath501548  @xmath51  optical depth over the wavelength range , and on the y - axis the corresponding optical depth at the second member of the civ doublet .",
    "we label these as @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively .",
    "features that correspond to uncontaminated civ absorption will lie along the diagonal line , which is indeed seen to be heavily populated .",
    "the parallel lines show the doublet ratio window , here set to 0.25  1 . clearly a narrower window could be used at high optical depths but since there is little contamination there is no necessity for this . at lower optical depth",
    "a narrower window would result in a larger proportion of the points being scattered out of the window . in this diagram ,",
    "absorption features that are not fall in the lower right corner if they lie at the 1548  @xmath51 position and in the upper left corner if they are at the 1550  @xmath51 position .",
    "it is these features that are cleaned from the sample by the doublet ratio selection .",
    "the final cleaned optical depth is @xmath52 for all objects that lie within the tramlines and zero for those outside .",
    "a major advantage of this method is that it allows an objective analysis of the degree of contamination since we can compare the optical depth distribution for a true doublet  , say  with a similarly generated optical depth distribution for artificial `` doublets '' with slightly different wavelength spacing .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : tramoff ] where we show the plot of @xmath54 versus @xmath52 for an artificial doublet with a 12  @xmath51 spacing .",
    "there are only a small number of contaminating points within the tramlines .",
    "it is also visually obvious by comparing figure  [ fig : tramon ] ( the true doublet ) with figure  [ fig : tramoff ] ( the artificial doublet ) that the signal of real doublets ( the difference between the number of true and artificial position ) persists at least to @xmath55 .",
    "the aim of the method is to find a statistical measure of the signal down to the deepest possible level .",
    "since the noise levels vary from spectrum to spectrum and since telluric contamination may be a function of the wavelength position , this type of analysis is best carried out individually on each quasar spectrum with the individual results subsequently being combined .",
    "figure  [ fig : odonoff ] shows the results for the @xmath56  quasar hs1946 + 7658 , which has a s / n at the low end of the high s / n quasar core sample .",
    "the solid histogram with @xmath57  error bars in figure  [ fig : odonoff ] is the @xmath45  optical depth distribution for lines in the spectrum selected as previously discussed .",
    "the dashed histogram is the average optical depth distribution retrieved from 20 artificial doublets with incorrect doublet separations ( approximately that of the doublet ) to model contamination of real doublets by interloper lines , bad pixels , continuum fitting structure , telluric absorption , etc .",
    "the difference of the two histograms shown in figure  [ fig : odsignal ] is the @xmath45  optical depth distribution statistically corrected for contamination .",
    "there is significant positive signal down to at least @xmath58 .",
    "the distributions must also be corrected for incompletness since lines that are contaminated by other absorption features will be missed and since noise and structure may scatter weak lines outside the selection window .",
    "that is , as well as knowing what the signal is , we also need to have an accurate estimate of the line recovery rate .",
    "we do this in standard fashion by introducing artifical lines into the real spectra and tracking the number of recoveries as a function of the optical depth .",
    "the lines are added in a monte carlo fashion drawn from the observed core sample distribution .",
    "the line widths are chosen to match the range seen in the observed absorption features but the method is not particularly sensitive to this choice .",
    "figure  [ fig : recovery ] shows a sample strip of spectrum into which two artificial lines with @xmath59  and two with @xmath60  have been introduced .",
    "the panels have the same meaning as in figure  [ fig : selec ] and the short vertical lines in the top panel indicate the wavelengths of the introduced lines .",
    "this is the line strength at which recovery starts to break down , going from 100% at @xmath61 to @xmath62  at @xmath59 .",
    "the recovery rate is also a function of the resolution of the spectra and contamination is more severe and recovery poorer in the lower resolution high - redshift esi spectra .",
    "the final recovery rate versus optical depth is shown in figure  [ fig : rate ] .",
    "this gives the incompleteness correction as a function of optical depth for the individual quasar spectrum , which can then be divided into the observed optical depth of figure  [ fig : odsignal ] to obtain the true optical depth distribution .",
    "for the high s / n core quasar sample , incompleteness reaches 50%  at an optical depth of @xmath63 .",
    "the cleaned optical depth vector contains all the information present in the traditional cloud analyses and in general it is best to use this directly to analyse the absorption structure .",
    "however , it is interesting and very straightforward to relate the present type of analysis to the analysis by voigt profile fitting and to see how well we reproduce the results previously obtained by this method . in addition",
    ", we can use the method to characterize the local environment in which a given optical depth point lies .",
    "we can use the superpod method to emulate the usual voigt profile fitting analysis of the spectra in an objective way .",
    "the basis of this is to generate ` pseudo - cloud complexes ' by combining neighboring optical depths with detections into a single line profile .",
    "we do this by first finding the maximum optical depth in the true optical depth vector .",
    "we then define the cloud complex as all positions with non - zero optical depths that are connected to the primary position , with gaps where the optical depth is zero being less than 100 km s@xmath64 .",
    "an example of a complex picked out in this way is shown in figure [ fig : pseudoex ] .",
    "positions already allocated to cloud complexes are eliminated from the cleaned optical depth vector and the process repeated .",
    "the column density is computed for each cloud complex from the integral of the optical depths included in it , with each optical depth being weighted by the completeness and contamination correction for that optical depth .",
    "the exact definition of ` neighboring ' is somewhat arbitrary in the use of the @xmath65  window to define the cloud size . in general , the wider the ` cloud ' window , the more likely one is to lose lower column density clouds as individual entities : they would be incorporated into broader ` cloud complexes ' .",
    "however , in practice , for reasonable values of the window the results are not too sensitive to this choice .",
    "we illustrate this in figure  [ fig : window ] , where we show the number of clouds found as a function of column density for velocity windows of 75  300  @xmath66 .",
    "the wider window reduces the number of independent low column density complexes but the effect is not large .    in figure",
    "[ fig : c4dist ] we show as open squares the raw column density distribution of pseudo - clouds obtained from optical depths retrieved by the superpod method from the core quasar sample at an average redshift of 2.7 .",
    "the filled squares with @xmath67 error bars show the distribution corrected for incompleteness and bias . for comparison ,",
    "the open circles show the results of a traditional analysis of the same set of objects , conducted in the usual way with visual identification of lines and subsequent manual voigt profile fitting .",
    "the best - fit line has a slope of @xmath1 , similar to the result of ellison et al .",
    "( 2000 ) at the same redshift .",
    "this is the dashed line in figure  [ fig : c4dist ] .",
    "the solid line has a slope of @xmath68 , based on fitting only to complexes with @xmath69 .    using the various quasar samples of table  1 at low and high redshifts ,",
    "we have constructed in this way the column density distributions in the redshift range 1.5  5.5 .",
    "in general , the superpod method using pseudo - cloud generation reproduces the invariance of column density distribution function with redshift already determined by traditional methods ( songaila 1997 , 2001 ; pettini et al .",
    "2003 ) and , with an extra sensitivity of about 0.5 dex over these previous results , the redshift invariance of the distribution functions is seen very clearly . following the methods used in the previous studies",
    ", we can also construct @xmath70  as a function of redshift , and this is shown in figure  [ fig : c4omega ] .",
    "this agrees very well with the traditional studies in showing that @xmath4  remains nearly invariant between redshifts 2 and 5 .",
    "this remains true whether counting stronger absorbers ( open squares : @xmath71 ) or all absorbers ( filled squares : @xmath72 ) .",
    "we can extend the method by computing the column densities of lines corresponding to other species for the range of velocities in each - selected cloud complex . for doublets such as we use the cleaned optical depth for that species while for singlets such as we simply use the raw optical depth .",
    "these ion ratios are shown as a function of redshift for the stronger cloud complexes in figures  [ fig : c2c4 ] and [ fig : si4c4 ] .",
    "in both figures , the small filled squares denote the ion ratios determined from the pseudo - clouds ( with width of @xmath73 ) , whereas the open diamonds show the median ion ratios in each redshift bin determined directly from the optical depths .",
    "figure  [ fig : c2c4 ] demonstrates that neither the range nor the median value of / changes significantly as a function of redshift , agreeing with schaye et al.(2003 ) .",
    "however , the same is not true of / , a result which a kolmogorov - smirnov test ( figure  [ fig : ks ] ) shows to be highly significant .",
    "the large open squares in figure  [ fig : si4c4 ] denote pseudo - clouds with high column density .",
    "the k - s test is based on all the and systems , including these strong ones . however , it is dominated by the larger numbers of smaller column density systems . on the other hand , evolution in both @xmath74 and @xmath75",
    "is dominated by the high column density end of the distribution .",
    "we discuss this further , using optical depth vectors , in paper  ii , and we postpone the interpretation to that paper .    in figure  16",
    "we show the distribution of the optical depths as a function of the column density of the cloud complex in which they lie .",
    "for the hires data there is a tight relation ( @xmath76 ) between the peak optical depth and the column density , which is washed out in the lower resolution esi data . in paper",
    "ii we shall revisit this relation , which imples that higher column density clouds , or , equivalently , systems with larger peak optical depths , are also wider in velocity space .",
    "it is encouraging that there is such good agreement between traditional voigt profile fitting methods and the objective , but still slightly arbitrary , method of generating pseudo - cloud complexes .",
    "however , the real merit of the superpod technique lies in the fact that the cleaned optical depth vectors contain all of the information about the amount of material , its distribution in strength , and the velocity structure of the absorption , and may be used directly to characterize these without ever resorting to arbitrary groupings .    in the present paper",
    "we use the optical depth vectors to determine the metallicity evolution directly from and optical depths , postponing a discussion of the velocity structure and the ionization balance evolution to paper ii .",
    "our results are shown in figure  [ fig : odomega ] for ( filled squares ) and ( filled diamonds ) in four redshift bins , [ 1.5,2.5 ] , [ 2.5,3.5 ] , [ 3.5,4.5 ] , and [ 4.5,5.5 ] .",
    "we see about a factor of two turndown in at @xmath77  and perhaps a larger turndown in at the same redshift .",
    "n of the data is declining at the highest redshifts and the sky systematics are higher but , even given these caveats , the slight turndown at these redshifts seems real and could correspond to a decline in the metal density or a change in the ionization balance ( shaye et al .",
    "irrespective of this point there is clearly a significant metal density in place at @xmath6 .    in figure  18",
    "we show the optical depth distributions of over the same redshift ranges .",
    "we have divided the quasar sample into five sets of five quasars , ordered by redshift , which are shown in the five panels , ( a ) to ( e ) .",
    "( we omitted the quasar pss0747 + 443 and divided the remainder to give the five groups . ) the redshift range of absorption in each set of quasars is marked on the panel .",
    "the three highest redshift panels are based on esi data and the two lowest on hires data . in each case",
    "we have overplotted the distribution obtained from the core high s / n quasar sample . for the esi data we have smoothed the comparison sample to the esi resolution .",
    "rather than show poisson error bars , which underestimate the errors because of correlation effects , we have shown in each case the range of the five quasars .",
    "there is very little change in the shape of the distribution over the redshift interval , which is consistent with the results of the voigt profile analyses .",
    "the slow change in the overall ion densities and the invariance of the distribution functions appear to suggest that contemporary injection must not be a dominant mechanism for producing the observed absorption lines , since we would in that case expect the features to track the evolution of the star - forming galaxies and to have some dependence on the changing properties of these objects . indeed ,",
    "even if this were the only mechanism present , we would expect that metals ejected by previous generations of star - foming galaxies would build up in the intergalactic gas , and that as time progressed the relative numbers of these versus those being formed by contemporary injection would change , so producing evolution in the column density distribution with redshift",
    ". however , such effects could be concealed if the ejected material becomes too hot to be observed as ( aguirre et al.2004 ) , and in the second paper of this series we will look at other approaches to determining the fraction of the lines that arise in contemporary injection .",
    "we have described a novel objective pixel optical depth technique , `` superpod '' , that uses the doublet nature of the common ions and , that are the principal metal tracers in the intergalactic medium outside of the ly@xmath0  forest , to analyze the properties of metals in the high redshift intergalactic medium using a sample of extremely high signal - to - noise keck hires and esi spectra of 26 quasars between redshifts 2.1 and 6.4 .",
    "the method is completely objective and , using statistical corrections for contamination by other lines , telluric absorption , bad pixels , continuum fitting , etc . and for incompleteness , gives us an increased sensitivity of approximately 0.5 dex over previous analyses .    as a check on the method",
    ", we have reproduced the conventional analysis using a percolation method to generate pseudo - clouds from ion optical depths . using this set of pseudo - clouds",
    "we confirm that the column density distribution remains essentially invariant , with slope @xmath1 , from @xmath2  to @xmath10 , which confirms the lack of redshift evolution of @xmath4  for @xmath5  to @xmath6  previously determined from conventional voigt profile fitting analysis .",
    "the pseudo - clouds also give information on the column density environment of a given optical depth : for the higher resolution hires data there is a tight relation , @xmath78 , between the peak optical depth and the column density .    using the optical depths directly",
    ", we show that there is little evolution in and / from @xmath79  to @xmath10 , though there is a turndown of at least a factor of two in @xmath4  and @xmath80  above @xmath6 ; we do , however , see substantial evolution in /.",
    "we will use this technique in two subsequent papers to investigate what fraction of the absorbers lie in galatic wind outflows ( paper ii ) and what metallicity is associated with regions of @xmath81  ( paper iii ) .",

    "<S> we have analyzed the properties of metals in the high redshift intergalactic medium using a novel objective pixel optical depth technique on a sample of extremely high signal - to - noise keck hires and esi spectra of 26 quasars between redshifts 2.1 and 6.4 . </S>",
    "<S> the technique relies on using the doublet nature of the common ions and that are the principal metal tracers in the intergalactic medium outside of the ly@xmath0  forest . </S>",
    "<S> optical depths are statistically corrected for contamination by other lines , telluric absorption , bad pixels , continuum fitting , etc . and </S>",
    "<S> for incompleteness , and we achieve in this way an increased sensitivity of approximately 0.5 dex over previous analyses . as with existing pixel optical depth analyses , </S>",
    "<S> the method is completely objective and avoids subjective cloud selection and voigt profile fitting , but , unlike existing techniques , we do not compare the ion optical depths with optical depths to determine the ion optical depth distributions ; we therefore avoid problems arising from different velocity widths in the ion and . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown how the conventional analysis can be reproduced using a percolation method to generate pseudo - clouds from ion optical depths . </S>",
    "<S> using this set of pseudo - clouds , we have generated column density distributions and have confirmed that the shape of the column density distribution remains essentially invariant , with slope @xmath1 , from @xmath2  to @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn confirms the lack of redshift evolution of @xmath4  for @xmath5  to @xmath6 , both for all absorbers with column density , @xmath7  and for stronger absorbers with @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the generation of pseudo - clouds from the optical depth vectors also gives information on the column density environment of a given optical depth . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for the higher resolution hires data there is a tight relation , @xmath9 , between the peak optical depth and the column density . </S>",
    "<S> we have then analyzed the ion redshift evolution directly and model - independently from the optical depth vectors themselves and show that there is little evolution in the total amount of from @xmath5  to @xmath10 , though there is a turndown of at least a factor of two in @xmath4  above @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we do , however , see substantial evolution in the ratio , /. </S>",
    "<S> in two subsequent papers in the series , we will use this technique to investigate what fraction of the absorbers lie in galatic wind outflows ( paper ii ) and what metallicity is associated with regions of @xmath11  ( paper iii ) . </S>"
