    "wave localization in random potentials has been intensively studied ever since its prediction by anderson in 1958 @xcite . notably uncorrelated random potentials in space dimension",
    "@xmath0 will lead to complete localization .",
    "metal - insulator transitions ( mit ) and possible mobility edges ( energies separating delocalized ( metallic ) from localized ( insulating ) eigenstates ) will typically appear in systems with space dimension @xmath1 . later studies of potentials with correlated disorder have shown that the dimension restriction for an mit can be lowered to @xmath0 if there are sufficiently strong correlations in the disorder potential @xcite .",
    "it came as a surprise that the quasiperiodic potential introduced by aubry and andr ( aa ) in 1980 allowed an mit when @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this mit is tuned by the strength of a @xmath2 potential whose period @xmath3 is irrational and therefore incommensurate with the lattice spacing @xmath4 .",
    "analytical results were obtained thanks to a duality principle relating states and spectra in direct and fourier space .",
    "this very principle however prevents the appearance of mobility edges ( the mit of the aa model is not dependent on the eigenenergy ) .",
    "attempts to generalize these results to other quasiperiodic potentials for @xmath0 showed that the localized regime could be maintained irrespective of the potential strength @xcite .",
    "further , fibonacci sequence based potentials kept the system at the critical point @xcite , and a mix of two aubry - andr potentials with different periods allowed the appearance of a mobility edge @xcite .",
    "a recent study of two interacting particles in the aubry - andr model established the appearance of metallic correlated bound states deep in the insulating regime for a single particle @xcite .",
    "experimental studies on light propagating through optical waveguide networks @xcite and ultracold atomic clouds expanding in optical potentials @xcite successfully tested the mit within the aubry - andr model .",
    "the flexibility in the choice of potentials within these studies makes them ideal testing grounds for other quasiperiodic potentials . at the same time these systems have finite size , and have unavoidable precision limitations on the generated potentials @xcite .",
    "desired effects like the mit or mobility edges are therefore needed only up to that precision , and only to be observable on these length scales .    in this work we present a systematic and constructive way to approximate a quasiperiodic potential by a periodic one .",
    "each approximation is defined both by its period and by the convergence criteria of the amplitude sequence of higher harmonics .",
    "this flexibility allows us to obtain a wide variety of quasiperiodic potentials which can be expected to exhibit the above phenomena .",
    "in addition the experimentally relevant length scale can be easily taken into account by the corresponding periodic approximation of a quasiperiodic potential .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in the next section we briefly discuss the aubry - andr model and some less known properties of wave packet spreading . in section iii",
    "we introduce the construction principle for the new class of quasiperiodic pontentials . in section",
    "iv we discuss the main properties of localized and extended states for particular amplitude sequences .",
    "finally we conclude and summarize .",
    "consider the @xmath0 dimensional discrete schrdinger operator @xmath5 , also known as aubry - andr model , defined by @xmath6 with quasi - periodic potential @xmath7 with a positive real strength @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and irrational @xmath10 . due to the self - dual character at @xmath11 , the model exhibits a transition between a metallic phase for @xmath120,2[$ ] and an insulating phase when @xmath122,+\\infty[$ ] .",
    "it is also well - known @xcite that , for any given @xmath13 in the insulating phase , all normal modes decay exponentially in space as @xmath14 , with the localisation length @xmath15 being independent of the eigenenergy .     of the aubry - andr model",
    "when @xmath16 . ]",
    "the eigenenergy spectrum @xmath17 ( eg .",
    "fig[fig1 ] ) of the aubry - andr model is a fractal set with a self - similiar structure which does not depend on @xmath18 .",
    "when @xmath16 is the golden mean , it consists of three bands , which again consist of three sub - bands and so forth ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the spectrum has a cantor set structure for all @xmath19 @xcite , and its lebesgue measure @xcite can be found analytically by the formula @xmath20 for @xmath120,2[$ ] ( metallic phase ) , the model has absolutely continuous spectrum @xcite , while for @xmath122,+\\infty[$ ] ( insulating phase ) it is a purely point spectrum @xcite . at the critical value @xmath11 , the spectrum is purely singular and continuous , @xcite . the spectrum s fractal dimension is @xmath21 for @xmath22 , and @xmath23 for @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "remarkably , there are much more exact results for the spectral properties of the aubry - andr model as compared to the dynamical properties of wave packet spreading @xmath24 where only a few numerical results are known @xcite .",
    "consider a single site excitation for a normalized wave function @xmath25 .",
    "its evolution in time leads to a time dependent distribution @xmath26 .",
    "the dynamics can be characterized by the second moment @xmath27 .",
    "we can distinguish different spreading regimes @xcite : @xmath28 where the coefficients are : the group velocity @xmath29 , the diffusion coefficient @xmath30 and the localisation length @xmath31 .",
    "in particular , spreading is ballistic in the metallic regime @xmath32 and diffusive at the critical point @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "we plot the time evolution of the second moment in fig.[fig2 ] .     for a single site excitation as a function of time in a log - log plot . from top to bottom : @xmath33 ( red ) , @xmath34 ( black ) , @xmath35 ( green ) , @xmath36 ( orange , ) @xmath11 ( blue ) , @xmath37 ( brown ) and @xmath38 ( violet ) .",
    "the dashed - dotted lines indicate power laws @xmath39 ( diffusive ) and @xmath40 ( ballistic ) . here",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath41 . ]",
    "we see that , indeed , for @xmath11 spreading appears to be diffusive , and we can confirm the predicted ballistic asymptotics in the metallic regime and localisation in the insulating regime .",
    "however , we also observe a diffusive transient in these regimes , which becomes longer the closer one gets to the critical point .",
    "on @xmath42 in the metallic phase in a log - log plot .",
    "the symbols are the actual computed values , the dashed line corresponds to the law @xmath43 . ]",
    "we compute the group velocity @xmath29 which is given by the square root of @xmath44 up to a constant prefactor , and plot it in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "we find that it vanishes at the critical point as @xmath43 .",
    "it remains an intriguing task to explain these spreading regimes in their relation to the cantor spectrum of the model .",
    "this concerns in particular the crossover time @xmath45 , the critical exponent for @xmath29 , and the question why spreading into a large but finite localization volume in the insulating regime happens to be diffusive and not ballistic , as for one - dimensional uncorrelated disorder ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ". these observations may be rather special features of the highly symmetric aubry - andr model which enjoys duality .",
    "we now construct quasiperiodic potentials in a systematic way approximating them by periodic potentials at each iteration step .",
    "the standard construction of a @xmath46 cantor set ( cut out the middle third of an interval , then repeat with the reamining subintervals ad infinitum ) gives a set of measure zero and nonzero hausdorff dimension @xmath47 . here",
    "we modify this procedure for the eigenenergy spectrum effectively by stretching and changing the cutting ratio .",
    "this is all achieved by defining sequences of periodic potentials with increasing spatial period . for simplicity",
    "we shall start with an example which has a three - band structure ( where each band again subdivides into three subbands etc ) similar to the golden mean case of the aubry - andr spectrum before we generalize .",
    "consider a sequence of discrete periodic functions @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "each function is periodic with spatial period @xmath50 : @xmath51 . the function @xmath52 is defined for @xmath53 by @xmath54 with the following schematic form : @xmath55 the second function @xmath56 has period @xmath57 : @xmath58 and the schematic form @xmath59 higher order functions @xmath48 are defined in a similar way and are characterized by the corresponding amplitude @xmath60 : @xmath61 with @xmath62 , and their schematic form is @xmath63    now we consider the superposition of all @xmath48 for all @xmath64 : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is again the potential strength parameter .",
    "the potential @xmath67 is periodic with period @xmath68 .",
    "for example , for @xmath69 we obtain a potential of period @xmath57 : @xmath70 with the spatial profile @xmath71    the same construction could be done for sequences of periodic functions @xmath48 with @xmath49 of spatial period @xmath72 with @xmath73 : @xmath51 .",
    "we can simplify notations by using the definition @xmath74_m\\equiv l \\ ; mod \\ ; m$ ] to arrive at @xmath75_{s^k}}{s^{k-1 } } \\bigg\\rfloor - \\delta(s ) \\bigg ) a_k = : \\phi_k(l ) a_k\\ , \\quad\\forall l\\in\\mathbb{z}\\ .\\ ] ] where @xmath76 denotes taking the integer part and @xmath77 the final expression for the potential @xmath67 is @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the generating sequence of the potential and @xmath80 the partitioning sequence .    in the absence of any potential @xmath81 the spectrum of the operator ( [ eq : h ] )",
    "is given by one band @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a bloch wave number .",
    "for @xmath84 the spectrum splits into three bands which are separated by two gaps .",
    "the first step in the above construction therefore cuts two segments out of the one band spectrum . at the next step of the approximation @xmath69 , the spatial period @xmath57 , and the spectrum consists now of 9 bands and 8 gaps .",
    "therefore each of the three bands of the @xmath84 spectrum is split into three narrower ones , with the new subgaps removing parts of the @xmath84 bands . at the same time",
    "the bands edges may also shift , thus we obtain a cantor - like iterative construction .",
    "we now push the iterative construction to its limit by extending ( [ eq : pot1 ] ) to an infinite sum @xmath85 the finiteness of this sum depends on the convergence properties of the generating sequence .",
    "we make the following definition : a sequence @xmath86 is _ quasiperiodic _ if for every @xmath87 , there is @xmath88 such that for all @xmath89 we have @xmath90 .",
    "we have the following :    * lemma .",
    "* let s consider a family @xmath91 of potentials , and suppose that for each @xmath92 the sequence @xmath93 is periodic with period @xmath94 and the tails satisfy @xmath95 then the sequence @xmath96 defined by the sum @xmath97 is quasiperiodic .",
    "the proof is simply to observe that any partial sum @xmath98 is periodic with period @xmath99 ( here @xmath100 means least common multiple ) and that the tail sums @xmath101 are uniformly small , independent of @xmath102 .",
    "so , for a given @xmath87 , we choose @xmath103 such that @xmath104 it follows that @xmath105 we have @xmath106    as a direct corollary we see that the potential defined by ( [ eq : npinf ] ) is quasiperiodic .",
    "thus the above class of quasiperiodic potentials , which is defined by its generating sequence @xmath107 and the choice of the integer @xmath108 of the partitioning sequence @xmath109 , is quasiperiodic and has a self - similar spectrum .",
    "in this section , we first analyze a particular case a of potentials , defined by the geometric sequence @xmath110 ( model a ) , for a real value @xmath1110,1[$ ] and @xmath112 @xmath113 first we consider @xmath114 .    in fig .",

    "a similar effect is seen in the aubry - andr model spectrum around the transition value @xmath11 .",
    "+ to characterize localization of the corresponding eigenstates , we compute the participation number @xmath118 of each eigenmode @xmath119 and consider the maximum @xmath120 for a given @xmath115 .     versus @xmath115 for @xmath121 .",

    "we find that @xmath123 drops down to zero around @xmath124 irrespective of the used system size ( fig.[fig5 ] ) .",

    "a similar mit arises for model b with the potential ( [ eq : npinf ] ) using an algebraic generating sequence @xmath127 : @xmath128 for a real value @xmath1291,+\\infty[$ ] .",
    "its phase diagram is shown in fig.[fig7 ] .    returning to model a , we compute again for @xmath114 the participation number @xmath130 of eigenstates for different values @xmath1110.25,0.6[$ ] .",
