    "a fundamental goal in the study of galaxy clusters is to understand the role of environment on galaxy formation and evolution . the well - established morphology  density relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we classify galaxies brighter than @xmath17 as `` giants '' and those having @xmath18 as `` dwarfs '' .",
    "we note that @xmath19 calculated from these data ( see b07 ) is @xmath20 .",
    "the measurement of @xmath21 , including applied k - corrections , is described in b07 .",
    "these magnitude cuts allow us to maximize the number of galaxies to improve statistical inferences while ensuring that incompleteness effects at the faint - end are negligible .",
    "we construct the cluster dgr by dividing the number of background - corrected dwarfs by the number of background - corrected giants .",
    "only clusters 100% photometrically complete to @xmath22 are included in the construction of the dgr . using this definition",
    ", we can employ the dgr to explore the change in the relative fraction of dwarfs and giants with respect to various cluster characteristics .",
    "the primary advantage of using the dgr is that it provides a non - parametric measurement of the relative change in the number of giant and dwarf galaxies that is independent of the functional form selected for the cluster lf ( e.g. , a schechter function ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , a steepening of the faint - end slope of the lf with increasing clustercentric radius would be characterized by an increase in the dgr @xcite .",
    "given the degree of degeneracy between the parameters in a schechter function fit ( e.g. , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; b07 ) , the dgr yields additional insights on the luminosity distribution of cluster galaxies and thus complements the lf .      to examine for a possible correlation of the dgr with cluster richness , we plot in figure  [ all - dgr - bgc ] the dgr versus the richness parameter @xmath2 for 39 clusters that are 100% photometrically complete to @xmath25 ( dgr uncertainties are calculated assuming poisson statistics and quadrature summation ) .",
    "the cluster optical richness is parameterized by @xmath2 , which is a measure of the cluster center  galaxy correlation amplitude ( yee & lpez - cruz 1999 ; yee & ellingson 2003 ; b07 ) . in figure",
    "[ all - dgr - bgc ] galaxies are selected within @xmath26 ( @xmath27 for the sample average ) of each cluster center for the red+blue , red , and blue cluster galaxy populations . the red+blue cluster galaxy sample is compiled by including galaxies that have been culled of systems redder than the cmr for each individual cluster ( for further details , see b07 ) .",
    "the center of each cluster is chosen as the position of the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) or , when some doubt exists , the nearest bright early - type galaxy to the x - ray centroid .",
    "the value of @xmath1 , an approximate measure of the virial radius @xcite , is derived from the relationship between @xmath1 and @xmath2 as described in b07 ( see their equation 7 ) , and is used as a scaling factor to minimize radial sampling bias due to variations in cluster richness @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 measurements for our cluster sample are tabulated in table 1 of b07 ( @xmath1 uncertainties are based on the 15% rms scatter in the derived value of @xmath1 as explained in b07 ) .",
    "the radial sampling criterion of @xmath28 was chosen to maximize the number of clusters in our sample that are photometrically complete to @xmath22 , and thus provide a large number of net galaxy counts to minimize the statistical uncertainty in the dgr .",
    "analysis of figure  [ all - dgr - bgc ] for the red+blue galaxies ( top panel ) indicates that there is no significant correlation between the dgr and cluster richness .",
    "a kendell s @xmath29 statistic @xcite yields a 49% probability that the dgr and @xmath2 are correlated . when not employing a dynamical counting radius ( e.g. @xmath1 ) , the mean and dispersion of the dgr vs. @xmath2 is increased significantly , indicating that the dgr is dependent on clustercentric radius ( see  3.2 for further discussions ) .",
    "we also plot in figure  [ all - dgr - bgc ] the dgr versus cluster richness for the red ( middle panel ) and blue ( bottom panel ) galaxy populations .",
    "the color - selection of galaxies into red and blue samples is described in detail in b07 .",
    "to briefly summarize ; the red galaxies are chosen if they are located within @xmath30 mag ( @xmath31 ) of the cluster cmr , while blue galaxies are selected from the area of the color - magnitude diagram that is blueward of the region used to select the red galaxies ( see figures 5 and 8 from b07 ) .",
    "as noted for the combined red+blue galaxy population , the red and blue galaxies have been background - corrected using the exact same color - selection criteria as for the cluster galaxies .",
    "similar to the red+blue sample , we find no significant correlation between the dgr and richness when considering the red and blue galaxies separately .",
    "a kendell s @xmath29 statistic indicates a 67% probability that the red dgr is correlated with @xmath2 ; while for the blue dgr , there is only a 3% probability that these quantities are correlated .    for the red+blue population",
    "we find a mean dgr of @xmath32 , where the uncertainties bracket the interval containing 68% of the data points about the mean .",
    "for the red and blue samples we have @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "the dominance of the dwarfs for the blue galaxy population compared to those in the red galaxy sample , is consistent with the findings from b07 in the sense that the blue lfs were found to have a steeper faint - end slope than the red sequence lfs .",
    "it is interesting to note that the blue dgr has a larger range of values and dispersion than the red dgr .",
    "this is an indication that blue galaxies in clusters have a larger variance in their properties and states of evolution compared to the red galaxies , which can be seen as primarily dominated by the end products of galaxy evolution and infall process .      in b07 we presented evidence for a steepening of the lf faint - end slope towards the cluster outskirts .",
    "to investigate this correlation further , we plot in figure  [ redblue - radius ] the dgr for the red+blue , red , and blue galaxy populations as a function of clustercentric radius .",
    "the dgr is plotted at the mid - point for the following annuli ; @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "the dgr is constructed by stacking cluster galaxies appropriate for each radial bin , and the uncertainty is derived from the standard deviation assuming poisson statistics . due to the variation in spatial imaging coverage , the number of clusters contributing to each radial bin is not equal . for all radius - dependent analysis in this study ,",
    "we only include clusters that have complete spatial coverage for the indicated clustercentric radius .",
    "examination of figure  [ redblue - radius ] shows that the dgr increases with radius for both the red and red+blue galaxy populations .",
    "for the red+blue galaxy sample the dgr is 2.7 times larger for the outer - most annulus as compared to the inner - most radial bin ( @xmath39 difference ) .",
    "for the red galaxies the dgr is @xmath40 times larger in the outer - most annulus as compared to the central region ( significant at the @xmath41 level ) .",
    "the dgr for the blue galaxies is approximately constant with perhaps even a possible decreasing trend with radius .",
    "we note that the uncertainties for the blue dgr are @xmath42 times greater than those for the red and red+blue samples .",
    "this is a direct result of a small background - corrected blue giant count .",
    "a weighted linear least - squares fit to the blue galaxy data indicates that the radial slope of the dgr is different from zero at the @xmath43 level .",
    "although the error bars are relatively large , the distribution of the blue dgr suggests a mild rising trend with _ decreasing _ radius .",
    "the rise in the dgr with increasing radius for the red+blue galaxy sample is a reflection of the increasing dominance of blue galaxies with radius .",
    "this result is in agreement with figures 4 and 7 from b07 where the red and red+blue galaxy populations were found to have a rising faint - end slope with increasing clustercentric radius .",
    "the faint - end slope of the blue galaxy lf depicted in figure 10 from b07 indicates a much weaker dependence on radius .",
    "figure  [ redblue - radius ] also shows that for all radii depicted , the dgr is larger for the blue than for the red galaxy sample .",
    "this finding is also supported by the comparison of red and blue lfs presented in figure 11 of b07 , and is a result of the larger contribution of luminous galaxies to the red sample as compared to the blue population .",
    "a comparison of the number of red and blue galaxies gives a rough indication of the relative mixture of early- and late - type systems .",
    "due to the poor seeing of our imaging data ( fwhm@xmath44 ) , morphological classification of galaxies with magnitudes near the completeness limit are not reliable .",
    "we therefore elect to use a broad - band color selection technique , such as the fraction of blue galaxies ( @xmath0 ; the number of blue galaxies divided by the number of red+blue galaxies ) , to glean some information about the galaxy population makeup of our sample .",
    "we note that @xmath0 is constructed from background - corrected galaxy counts , and only includes clusters that are 100% photometrically complete for the indicated magnitude range .",
    "      in figure  [ fb - bgc ] we present @xmath0 versus cluster richness for galaxies selected within @xmath45 of each cluster center . to search for luminosity - related dependencies in the distribution of @xmath0 with cluster richness , we plot @xmath0 for galaxies with @xmath46 ( 14 clusters ; open symbols ) and @xmath47 ( 16 clusters ; filled symbols ) .",
    "we note that the magnitude limit utilized by @xcite to characterize the cluster blue fraction corresponds to @xmath48 using our adopted cosmology and filter @xcite . in order to minimize redshift bias ( i.e. , the dominance in our sample of rich clusters at high redshift ) , we selected a redshift range ( @xmath49 ) such that a fair representation of cluster richness is available . using clusters with @xmath49",
    ", we find for the bright sample ( @xmath47 ) , @xmath50 , while for the deep sample ( @xmath46 ) we measure @xmath51 ( uncertainties are calculated assuming poisson statistics ) .",
    "examination of figure  [ fb - bgc ] reveals that there is no significant correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath2 for either the deep or bright sample .",
    "a kendell s @xmath29 statistic yields a 59%(47% ) probability of a correlation for the deep(bright ) sample . using @xmath52 as our counting aperture also yields no significant correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath2 . using the equivalent butcher & oemler magnitude counting limit of @xmath48",
    ", we find @xmath53 .",
    "a kendell s @xmath29 statistic gives a 75% probability of a correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "thus no significant correlation between @xmath0 and cluster richness is discernible when counting galaxies within an equivalent dynamical radius .",
    "this indicates that the galaxy population in clusters is not dependent on cluster richness if a dynamics - dependent radius is used in sampling .      to search for a possible radial dependence of @xmath0 , we plot in figure  [ fb - radius ] the @xmath0 in concentric annuli versus clustercentric radius for the dwarfs ( open squares ) , giants ( open triangles ) , and giants+dwarfs ( filled circles ) samples .",
    "several aspects of the galaxy @xmath0 are apparent : a ) at any radius the dwarf galaxies have a greater @xmath0 than the giants , b ) the giant @xmath0 increases approximately monotonically with increasing radius , with a five - fold increase from the inner to the outer radial bin ( @xmath54 difference ) , and c ) the dwarf @xmath0 , while decreasing by a factor of @xmath55 at the inner - most radius , stays approximately constant at radii greater than @xmath56 .    to determine the relative change in the red and blue galaxies for the two inner - most radial bins , we restrict our cluster sample to include only those clusters that contribute to both annuli .",
    "using this common cluster sample we find that there is a 53% decrease in the net number of blue dwarfs when comparing the @xmath36 and @xmath35 radial bins . on the other hand ,",
    "the net number of red dwarfs decrease by 20% . for the giants we measure a decrease of 58% for the blue galaxies and a 7.1% _ increase",
    "_ for the red galaxies .    to ascertain the relative change in the radial - dependence of @xmath0 as a function of magnitude , we present in figure  [ cumlativefb - radius ] the @xmath0 as a function of @xmath57 for the four radial bins used in figure  [ fb - radius ] ( @xmath0 is constructed by counting galaxies in bins of one magnitude in width )",
    "this figure demonstrates that @xmath0 for the outer - most annulus ( @xmath38 ) is greater at each magnitude interval than for @xmath0 measured for the inner annuli .",
    "in addition , @xmath0 for all four radial bins generally show an increase when counting galaxies from progressively fainter magnitude bins .",
    "the data depicted in figure  [ cumlativefb - radius ] suggests that luminous galaxies may undergo a more rapid change in their color composition than the dwarf galaxies .",
    "for example , @xmath0 for galaxies in the @xmath58 mag bin declines by a factor of 4.2 from the outer to the inner radial bin , while @xmath0 decreases by a factor of 1.5 for galaxies in the @xmath59 mag bin ( @xmath60 difference in both cases ) .    as a caveat we note that our results based on figures  [ fb - radius ] and [ cumlativefb - radius ] demonstrate that the counting aperture and magnitude range has a direct impact on the value of @xmath0 , and",
    "thus one must be cautious when comparing blue fractions for clusters with disparate masses from a variety of sources ( see also , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .      to test for a correlation between @xmath0 and redshift , we present in figure  [ fb - redshift ] the @xmath0 versus redshift for ; a ) galaxies brighter than @xmath61 ( filled symbols ; 54 clusters ) , b ) galaxies selected with @xmath46 ( open symbols ; 39 clusters ) , and c ) galaxies brighter than the equivalent @xcite magnitude limit ( @xmath62 ; solid triangles , 54 clusters ) .",
    "the @xmath0 s depicted in figure  [ fb - redshift ] are constructed by including only galaxies within a clustercentric radius of @xmath28 . a kendell s @xmath29 statistic for the @xmath63 sample",
    "yields a probability of 100% that @xmath0 and redshift are correlated .",
    "inspection of figure  [ fb - redshift ] shows that @xmath0 increases with redshift for @xmath64 .",
    "restricting our analysis to clusters with @xmath65 , we find a correlation probability of only 8% .",
    "thus most of the correlation between @xmath0 and redshift is due to clusters with @xmath64 .",
    "for the cluster sample with @xmath46 , we find that @xmath0 and redshift are correlated at the 90% significance level . limiting the @xmath63 sample to the same redshift range ( @xmath66 ) , we find a correlation probability of 98% . using the magnitude limit @xmath62 for the full redshift range ( @xmath67 ) , we find that @xmath0 and redshift are correlated at the 97% significance level .",
    "the correlation between @xmath0 and redshift is most - likely a reflection of the butcher - oemler effect @xcite , in which the fraction of blue cluster galaxies increases with look - back time .",
    "since our cluster sample only extends to @xmath68 , we are not able to make any firm conclusions on the redshift evolution of @xmath0 . however ,",
    "figure  [ fb - redshift ] and our correlation measurements indicate that the butcher - oemler effect is magnitude - dependent , such that a fainter magnitude limit yields a larger effect .",
    "unfortunately our @xmath46 sample lacks a statistically significant number of clusters at @xmath69 .",
    "a major goal of this paper is to examine the luminosity and color distribution of individual and composite cluster galaxy populations .",
    "many potential correlations may be obscured when only a limited number of cluster galaxies are available . to mitigate this effect , we compiled composite samples by stacking together galaxies from individual clusters . to minimize radial sampling bias , we scaled each cluster s counting aperture by @xmath1 prior to combining galaxy counts",
    ". radial sampling bias can be problematic when comparing individual clusters ( see , for example , b07 ) , hence the need to scale clusters by a common dynamical radius .",
    "this point is aptly illustrated by the recent studies of @xcite in which significant correlations between the dgr and various cluster characteristics ( mass , velocity dispersion , x - ray luminosity , and optical luminosity ) were found when measuring the dgr using a fixed metric aperture , but were much less significant when scaling the counting aperture by @xmath1 . in a study by @xcite and @xcite , cluster richness and @xmath0 were found to be correlated such that poor systems have a higher @xmath0 , which we suggest is the result of using a fixed counting aperture .",
    "our results , along with those from many others , show that quantities such as the dgr and @xmath0 are dependent on the luminosity definitions of the galaxy samples used .",
    "when comparing different studies , care should be taken to account for any possible effects arising from the galaxy luminosity or mass limits .",
    "some recent studies have examined the dgr and @xmath0 based on spectroscopic data from the sdss galaxy sample ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , these studies , while statistically more robust , are in general much shallower than investigations applying a statistical background correction method to photometric data . studies using photometric galaxy samples , going typically two to three magnitudes deeper , provide considerably larger leverage in sampling the dependence of galaxy population and evolution on luminosity / mass .      in a study by @xcite",
    "the dgr for a spectroscopically - measured sample of 60 clusters from the 2df galaxy redshift survey were presented .",
    "transforming their magnitudes to @xmath14 @xcite and adopting our cosmology , de propris et al . defines giants as those galaxies with @xmath70 and dwarfs with @xmath71 .",
    "they divide their galaxies based on spectroscopic type , and find @xmath72 and @xmath73 for galaxies with early- and late - type spectra , corresponding to our red and blue galaxy samples .",
    "their results show the same trend as ours for red and blue galaxies (  3.1 ) .",
    "the blue dgr obtained by de propris et al . is smaller than the value we measured , and is likely due to their division between the giant and dwarf populations being almost 2 mag brighter .",
    "we also note that de propris et al .",
    "counts galaxies within an aperture of @xmath74 mpc in radius rather than scaling relative to a dynamical radius .",
    "they also determined that the dgr is smaller for galaxies selected within @xmath75 mpc of the composite cluster center as compared to galaxies at larger radii ( @xmath76 difference ) . in figure  [ redblue - radius ]",
    "we showed that the dgr increases with clustercentric radius for the red+blue cluster galaxy population ( at the @xmath77 level ) .",

    "result would be of higher significance if the cluster counting aperture was scaled by a common dynamical radius .",

    "our results are in agreement with @xcite and @xcite , who found no significant correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath81 .    utilizing a sample of 60 clusters ( @xmath93 ) selected spectroscopically from the 2dfgrs , @xcite searched for correlations between @xmath0 and various cluster properties . in figure  [ cumlativefb - radius ]",
    "we showed that @xmath0 is sensitive both to the adopted absolute magnitude range and clustercentric distance used to select galaxies .",
    "de propris et al . reached a similar conclusion by determining that @xmath0 increases both with decreasing luminosity and increasing clustercentric radius .",
    "in addition , de propris et al . also found that there is no significant correlation between @xmath0 and cluster richness when measured within @xmath94 .",
    "this is also in agreement with our results depicted in figure  [ fb - bgc ] .",
    "in this study we have examined the radial dependence of the luminosity and color distribution of cluster galaxies by utilizing the dgr and @xmath0 . scaling the galaxy counting aperture relative to @xmath1 ,",
    "allows us to minimize radial sampling bias .",
    "the main results highlighted in this paper and encapsulated in figures  [ redblue - radius ] and [ fb - radius ] , suggests that some type of dynamical mechanism may be responsible for the decline in the number of blue dwarf galaxies relative to the corresponding red systems in the cluster core region .",
    "the trend depicted in figure  [ redblue - radius ] implies that the dgr for the blue galaxies is approximately constant with radius .",
    "this suggests that the decrease in the number of blue dwarfs toward the cluster center is accompanied by a decline in the number of blue giants , thus maintaining a roughly constant dgr .",
    "a decrease in @xmath0 for the giant galaxies in the cluster core region ( figure  [ fb - radius ] ) and a drop in the dgr for the red galaxies , suggests that the relative fraction of red giants increases toward the cluster center .",
    "these results support the general view that blue galaxies dominate the galaxy population in the outskirts of clusters in contrast to the central cluster region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they also imply that field galaxies , which are generally bluer than cluster galaxies ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , fall into the cluster environment , turn red ( possibly via some process that truncates star formation ) , and that blue dwarf galaxies get preferentially disrupted or transformed into red dwarfs at small clustercentric radii .",
    "these findings are open to several possible interpretations : a ) blue and red dwarfs get disrupted tidally or undergo mergers with giant galaxies at roughly the same rate , which destroy individual dwarfs , except in the cluster core region , where the red dwarfs have a higher survival rate ; b ) the average dwarf galaxy star formation rate remains relatively unchanged until the dwarfs reach the central cluster region , where the influence of ram pressure and cluster tidal effects are expected to be maximized ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , quenching star formation and transforming the galaxies into red dwarfs ; and c ) the transformation rate of blue into red galaxies resulting from the quenching of star formation is more efficient in giants than in dwarfs ( see figure  [ cumlativefb - radius ] ) .",
    "the first interpretation requires that blue dwarfs are more susceptible than red dwarfs to destructive forces in the cluster central region .",
    "some support for this idea is garnered from the fact that blue dwarfs are very similar to the low - mass dwarf spheroidal galaxies , which are expected to undergo tidal disruption in the cluster environment @xcite .",
    "these galaxies may potentially be the source of tidally - disrupted material that helped to form the halo of cd galaxies @xcite .",
    "the red dwarf galaxies , however , may be part of a population of nucleated dwarfs @xcite that would be expected to have a deeper gravitational potential well than the more diffuse dwarf spheroidal population .",
    "this would allow them to more efficiently survive cluster tidal forces against disruption than the dwarf spheroidals ( i.e. , non - nucleated dwarf galaxies ; see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nucleated cluster dwarf galaxies have been shown to have colors that are redder on average than non - nucleated dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus supports the suggestion that the red dwarf population is composed mainly of nucleated dwarf galaxies .    for the second scenario ,",
    "if the blue dwarf galaxies in the cluster core have been stripped of their gas , had their star formation truncated , and transformed into red dwarf galaxies , we would expect that the number of red dwarf galaxies would increase with decreasing clustercentric radius .",
    "figure  [ redblue - radius ] indicates that the red dgr actually decreases by a factor of @xmath95 toward the inner - cluster region . unless a large fraction of blue giants , as compared to blue dwarfs , get transformed into red systems , this simple explanation for the decreasing number of blue dwarfs in the core does not seem plausible .",
    "furthermore , figure  [ redblue - radius ] indicates that the blue dgr is approximately constant with radius , contrary to what is expected if a large fraction of blue giants are transformed into red galaxies in order to decrease the red dgr in the cluster core .",
    "the third explanation supposes that the quenching of star formation is more efficient in giant galaxies than in dwarfs .",
    "naively , this conjecture can be supported from the results in figure  [ cumlativefb - radius ] , where the more luminous galaxies show a larger decrease in @xmath0 from the outer- to the inner - cluster region than the less luminous galaxy population .",
    "however , this seems an unlikely explanation , since , with their lower gravitational potential , we would expect most physical mechanisms in clusters that affects star formation rate in galaxies should have a relatively larger effect in dwarf galaxies than the more massive giant galaxies .",
    "the tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies is a possible physical mechanism to help explain the observations presented in this paper ; an alternative interpretation is that the blue dwarf galaxies simply fade and turn red as they fall toward the cluster center , and are subsequently detected as red galaxies in the inner - cluster region .",
    "this idea is not unreasonable if we expect that star formation for infalling dwarf galaxies gets truncated , with an ensuing passive evolution of the stellar population ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the exact number of blue dwarfs that would be expected to fade and turn red , or to disappear due to disruption or merger , can not be accurately calculated with a simple toy model .",
    "a detailed n - body simulation that incorporates a complete accounting of stellar evolution and traces the evolutionary path of each dwarf galaxy would be required . nevertheless , we are able to place limits on the fraction of blue dwarfs that have faded and turned red or that have been disrupted , by comparing the blue - to - red dwarf luminosity ratio between the inner- ( @xmath96 ) and outer - most ( @xmath97 ) radial bins .    for the case of pure disruption ,",
    "@xmath97 was measured for the @xmath38 radial bin using background - corrected net galaxy counts .",
    "the luminosity of the blue and red galaxies were calculated by multiplying the number of galaxies per magnitude bin with the luminosity - equivalent of the mid - bin magnitude .",
    "using our magnitude definition of a dwarf galaxy ( i.e. , @xmath98 ) , we find that @xmath99 .    for the inner annulus , @xmath35 , @xmath96 was calculated in the same manner as for the outer radial bin except that the magnitude distribution of the background - corrected galaxies is determined using the deprojected cluster lf ( see b07 ) . the deprojected lf is constructed by subtracting the contribution of galaxies located in the cluster outskirts that are projected onto the central cluster region .",
    "the deprojected lf thus provides a more accurate estimate of the galaxy luminosity distribution in the cluster center , especially at the faint end . using the deprojected lf",
    ", we found that @xmath100 . using our measured luminosity ratios ,",
    "the expected fraction of disrupted blue dwarfs ( @xmath101 ) can be estimated from @xmath102 . solving for @xmath101 we find @xmath103 , and",
    "thus approximately 81% of the blue dwarfs would undergo disruption as they fall into the central cluster region .    for the case of pure fading with an associated reddening",
    ", we employ the library of evolutionary stellar population synthesis models computed using the isochrone code of @xcite , to provide an estimate of the amount of fading / reddening that an infalling galaxy would experience . adopting the concordance cosmological parameters ( i.e. , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 ) , the timescale for the infall of a typical dwarf galaxy from the @xmath38 annulus",
    "is estimated by adopting the average value of @xmath1 and the mean velocity dispersion for our 57-cluster sample . using the @xmath2 values tabulated in b07 , and the relationship between @xmath2 and velocity dispersion from @xcite , we find @xmath107 mpc and @xmath108 .",
    "using these values yields an average infall timescale of approximately 2 gyr . adopting a salpeter initial mass function @xcite , solar metallicity , a single - burst star formation model to simulate star formation truncation , and a 2 gyr time - frame for passive evolution",
    ", we predict a @xmath109 mag fading in @xmath14 and a reddening of @xmath110 mag .",
    "for the case of fading / reddening of dwarf galaxies , we invoke a similar procedure as that used for the disruption scenario .",
    "for this case we count dwarf galaxies in the @xmath38 annulus using the magnitude range @xmath111 in order to compensate , to first order , for the expected 0.2 mag fading for an infalling galaxy . for the outer radial bin",
    "we find @xmath112 .",
    "the expected fraction of galaxies that have undergone fading with an associated reddening can be estimated from @xmath113 . solving for @xmath101 yields @xmath114 , and thus approximately 57% of the blue dwarfs",
    "would be expected to have undergone fading and reddening as they reach the inner - cluster region .",
    "it seems unlikely , however , that a pure fading scenario can explain the change of @xmath115 seen from the outer to inner region of clusters .",
    "first , applying the same procedure of fading to the giant galaxies , we find that 80% of the blue galaxies are expected to undergo fading and reddening by the time they reach the cluster core from the outer annulus .",
    "this is likely the dominant cause for the change in @xmath115 for the giant galaxies , since it is unlikely that they can be easily destroyed by tidal forces .",
    "if we assume that blue dwarfs were to fade by the same fraction , then the dwarf blue - to - red luminosity would be much smaller than what is measured , by a factor of about @xmath116 ; unless some mechanism is invoked that fades blue giant galaxies by a much larger fraction than dwarf galaxies . due to the lower gravitational potential possessed by dwarf galaxies , almost all mechanisms used to explain the hastening of galaxy evolution in rich environments operate equally or more efficiently for lower - mass galaxies ; e.g. , ram pressure , tidal interactions , harassment , etc . the only mechanism that could produce a higher fraction of the quenching of star formation in massive galaxies is agn feedback , in that more massive galaxies will be more likely to contain a massive black hole required for the agn activity .",
    "second , in a pure fading scenario for dwarf galaxies , we would expect the dgr for the blue+red sample to stay approximately constant from the outer to the inner region , unless the parent populations of galaxies from which the inner and outer regions are drawn from are very different .",
    "instead , we find there is a factor of 4 difference in the dgr between the outer annulus and the cluster core .",
    "while the discussion above can not completely rule out the pure fading scenario , it seems likely that , as blue dwarf galaxies fall into the cluster core , at least some fraction of them will be destroyed either by tidal disruption , or mergers with larger galaxies .",
    "in this paper we have studied the luminosity and color properties of a sample of 57 low - redshift abell clusters .",
    "our main conclusions are :    \\1 ) the dgr for the red , blue , and red+blue cluster galaxies are independent of cluster richness when scaling the counting aperture by a dynamical radius ( i.e. , @xmath1 ) . also , the dgr for blue galaxies is larger than for red systems .",
    "\\3 ) the @xmath0 was found not to correlate with cluster richness when counting galaxies within a dynamical radius ; however , it is found to be correlated with the adopted counting aperture and magnitude limit .",
    "\\6 ) based on the clustercentric radial dependence of the dgr and the galaxy blue fraction , it is unlikely that either a pure disruption or a pure fading / reddening scenario can describe the evolution of infalling dwarf galaxies ; both outcomes are produced by the cluster environment .",
