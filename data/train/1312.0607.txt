    "massive stars play a key role in our universe .",
    "they drive the chemical evolution of galaxies by synthesising most of the heavy elements . their strong stellar winds , radiation feedback , powerful supernova explosions and long gamma ray bursts shape the interstellar medium .",
    "they are thought to have played an essential role in reionising the universe after the dark ages and are visible up to large distances .",
    "unfortunately , our understanding of the formation and evolution of the most massive stars in the local universe is incomplete .",
    "recently it was established that most of the massive stars in the milky way are actually part of a binary star system and that more than @xmath0 of them will exchange mass with a companion during their life @xcite .",
    "our understanding of these stars is further hampered by two major controversies .",
    "the first one , the cluster age problem , concerns the ages of the youngest star clusters . emerging star clusters",
    "are expected to form stars in a time span shorter than the lifetime of their most massive members @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the most luminous stars in two of the richest young clusters in our galaxy , the arches and quintuplet clusters , show an apparently large age range .",
    "their hydrogen- and nitrogen - rich wolf - rayet ( wnh ) stars appear significantly younger than most of their less luminous o stars .",
    "similar age discrepancies are observed in other young stellar systems such as the cygnus ob2 association and the star clusters pismis  24 and ngc  6611 .    the second controversy , the maximum stellar mass problem , concerns the stellar upper mass limit . such a upper mass limit is theoretically motivated by the eddington - limit which may prevent stellar mass growth by accretion above a certain mass .",
    "observationally , an upper mass limit of about @xmath7 is derived from the individual stellar mass distributions of the arches and the r136 clusters @xcite and from a broader analysis of young stellar clusters @xcite .",
    "this result is questioned by a recent analysis of very massive stars in the core of r136 , in which stars with initial masses of up to about @xmath9 are found @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recently detected ultra - luminous supernovae in the local universe are interpreted as explosions of very massive stars  e.g. sn  2007bi is well explained by a pair - instability supernova from an initially @xmath10 star @xcite .    here",
    ", we show that both controversies can be resolved by considering a time dependent stellar mass function in young star clusters that accounts for stellar wind mass loss and binary mass exchange .",
    "we perform detailed population synthesis calculations of massive single and binary stars that include all relevant physical processes affecting the stellar masses and compare them to observed present day mass functions of the arches and quintuplet clusters .",
    "our methods and the observations of the mass functions of the arches and quintuplet clusters are described in sec .",

    "we analyse the arches and quintuplet clusters in two steps .",
    "first , we model their observed stellar mass functions to e.g. determine the initial mass function ( imf ) slopes and the cluster ages .",
    "we set up a dense grid of single and binary stars , assign each stellar system in the grid a probability of existence given the initial distribution functions ( cf .",
    "[ sec : init - distr - fcts ] ) and evolve the stars in time using our rapid binary evolution code described ( cf .",
    "[ sec : binaryc ] ) .",
    "present - day mass functions are then constructed from the individual stellar masses at predefined ages .",
    "this ensures that all the relevant physics like stellar wind mass loss and binary mass exchange , which directly affects stellar masses , is factored in our mass functions .",
    "second , we investigate stochastic sampling effects to e.g. compute the probability that the most massive stars in the arches and quintuplet clusters are binary products . to that end , we randomly draw single and binary stars from initial distribution functions until the initial cluster masses are reached and , again , evolve the drawn stellar systems with our rapid binary evolution code . the set - up of these monte carlo experiments",
    "is described in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : mc - experiments ] .",
    "the initial distribution functions used in the above mentioned steps are summarised in sec .",
    "[ sec : init - distr - fcts ] and an overview of the observations of the arches and quintuplet clusters to which we compare our models is given in sec .  [",
    "sec : observations ] .",
    "we bin mass functions in a non - standard way to compare them to observations  the binning procedure is described in sec .",
    "[ sec : binning - procedure ] .",
    "the details of our population synthesis code are described in @xcite and @xcite . here , we briefly summarise the most important methods and assumptions that are used to derive our results .",
    "we use a binary population code to evolve single and binary stars and follow the evolution of the stellar masses and of other stellar properties as a function of time .",
    "our code is based on a rapid binary evolution code @xcite which uses analytic functions @xcite fitted to stellar evolutionary models with convective core overshooting @xcite to model the evolution of single stars across the whole hertzsprung - russell diagram .",
    "we use a metallicity of @xmath13 .",
    "stellar wind mass loss is applied to all stars with luminosities larger than @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the mass accretion rate during mass transfer is limited to the thermal rate of the accreting star .",
    "binaries enter a contact phase and merge if the mass ratio of accretor to donor is smaller than a critical value at the onset of roche lobe overflow @xcite .",
    "when two main sequence stars merge , we assume that @xmath15 of the total mass is lost and that @xmath15 of the envelope mass is mixed with the convective core @xcite .    photometric observations of star clusters can not resolve individual binary components . in order to compare our models to observations",
    "we assume that binaries are unresolved in our models and determine masses from the combined luminosity of both binary components utilising our mass - luminosity relation .",
    "hence unresolved , pre - interaction binaries contribute to our mass functions .",
    "we concentrate on main sequence ( ms ) stars because stars typically spend about @xmath16 of their lifetime in this evolutionary phase ; moreover , our sample stars used for comparison are observationally colour - selected to remove post - ms objects .",
    "if a binary is composed of a post - ms and a ms star , we take only the ms component into account .",
    "we assume that primary stars in binaries and single stars have masses @xmath17 distributed according to a power law initial mass function ( imf ) with slope @xmath18 , @xmath19 in the mass range @xmath20 to @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 is a normalisation constant ) .",
    "secondary star masses , @xmath23 , are taken from a flat mass ratio distribution , i.e. all mass ratios @xmath24 are equally probable @xcite .",
    "the initial orbital periods for binaries with at least one o - star , i.e. a primary star with @xmath25 , mass ratio @xmath26 and a period @xmath27 are taken from the distribution of stars in galactic open clusters @xcite .",
    "the initial periods of all other binaries follow a flat distribution in the logarithm of the orbital period @xcite .",
    "orbital periods are chosen such that all interacting binaries are taken into account , i.e. the maximum initial orbital separation is @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "binaries with wider orbits would be effectively single stars .      to address stochastic sampling , we perform monte carlo simulations of star clusters and investigate the probability that the most massive star in a star cluster is a product of binary evolution as a function of cluster mass , age , binary fraction and imf slope .",
    "we assume that all stars are coeval and that every star cluster forms from a finite supply of mass with stellar masses stochastically sampled from initial distribution functions .",
    "while single stars are sampled from the initial mass function , binary stars are chosen from a larger parameter space of primary and secondary masses and orbital periods .",
    "this larger parameter space is better sampled in clusters of higher mass .",
    "we draw single and binary stars for a given binary fraction from the initial distribution functions of primary mass , secondary mass and orbital period until a given initial cluster mass , @xmath30 , is reached . here",
    "we consider only stars with masses in the range of @xmath20@xmath21 .",
    "the true cluster masses are therefore larger if stars below @xmath31 are added . including these stars according to a kroupa imf @xcite , increases the true cluster mass by @xmath32 and @xmath33 for high mass ( @xmath34 ) imf slopes of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "after the stellar content of a cluster is drawn , we evolve the stars in time to analyse whether the most massive stars at a given cluster age result from close binary interaction . repeating this experiment @xmath37 times",
    "provides the probability that the most massive cluster star formed from binary interactions , how long it takes on average until the most massive star is a product of binary evolution , @xmath38 , and how many stars have on average a mass larger than that of the most massive cluster star ( @xmath39 ) which did not accrete from a companion , @xmath40 .",
    "the most massive star that did not accrete from a companion can be a genuine single star or a star in a binary where binary mass transfer has not yet happened . from here on we refer to this star as ` the most massive genuine single star ' .",
    "we evolve and distribute stars as described in secs .",
    "[ sec : binaryc ] and  [ sec : init - distr - fcts ] .    to compare our monte carlo simulations with observations of the arches and quintuplet clusters , we need to know the corresponding cluster masses @xmath41 in our monte carlo experiments .",
    "we use imf slopes of @xmath42 as later determined in sec .",
    "[ sec : comparison - mass - functions ] for both clusters .",
    "the observations used for comparison are complete for masses @xmath43 , corresponding to @xmath44 and @xmath45 stellar systems in the arches and quintuplet and integrated masses of stars more massive than @xmath46 of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "our best fitting monte carlo models of the central regions of arches and quintuplet with primordial binary fractions of @xmath49 and @xmath50 have @xmath51 stellar systems with an integrated ( initial ) mass of @xmath52 and @xmath53 stellar systems with an integrated initial mass of @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "these models correspond to initial cluster masses of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively , in stars with @xmath57 .",
    "we assume that binaries are resolved in our monte carlo calculations , contrary to when we model mass functions in order to compare to observed mass functions .",
    "this is because we make theoretical predictions and are thus interested in individual masses of all stars regardless of them being in a binary or not .",
    "the observed present - day mass functions of the arches and quintuplet clusters were obtained from naos / conica ( naco ) photometry at the vlt . the arches cluster was observed in 2002 over a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath58 .",
    "the centre of the quintuplet cluster was imaged with naco over a fov of @xmath59 in 2003 and 2008 , which allowed the construction of a membership source list from proper motions .",
    "both data sets were obtained in the @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) and @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) passbands .",
    "the colour information is used to remove likely blue foreground interlopers , red clump and giant stars towards the galactic center line of sight .",
    "details can be found in @xcite for the arches cluster and in for the quintuplet cluster .    in the case of the arches cluster ,",
    "the known radial variation of the extinction is removed prior to individual mass determination employing the extinction law of @xcite .",
    "masses are then derived from the @xmath62 magnitudes of each star by comparison with a @xmath64 geneva isochrone . in the case of the quintuplet , the better photometric performance allowed all sources to be individually dereddened to a @xmath65 padova ms isochrone using the recently updated near - infrared extinction law towards the galactic center line of sight @xcite .",
    "as detailed in , isochrone ages of @xmath66 and @xmath67 do not significantly alter the shape and slope of the constructed mass function .",
    "all mass determinations are based on solar metallicity evolution models .    with the aim to minimise any residual field contamination , only the central @xmath68 or @xmath69 of the arches and @xmath70 or @xmath71 of the quintuplet ( at an assumed distance of @xmath72 to the galactic center ; @xcite ) were selected to construct the mass functions .",
    "for the arches cluster , this radial selection corresponds approximately to the half - mass radius , which implies that the mass projected into this annulus is of the order of @xmath73 . in the quintuplet cluster",
    ", the total mass is estimated to be @xmath74 within the considered @xmath71 radius .",
    "the mass functions in the central regions of arches and quintuplet have slopes that are flatter than the usual salpeter slopes , most likely because of mass segregation .",
    "the most massive stars in the arches and quintuplet clusters are hydrogen and nitrogen rich wnh stars . as reliable masses",
    "can not be derived for these wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars from photometry alone , and as several of the wrs in the quintuplet suffered from saturation effects , the most massive stars are excluded from the mass functions .",
    "this affects @xmath75 wnhs stars with uncertain masses in arches and @xmath66 ( plus @xmath76 post - ms , carbon rich wr stars ) in quintuplet .",
    "these wnh stars are expected to contribute to the high mass tail of the arches and quintuplet mass functions .",
    "following @xcite , we employ a binning procedure that renders the observed mass functions independent of the starting point of the bins .",
    "we shift the starting point by one tenth of the binsize and create mass functions for each of these starting points .",
    "we use a fixed binsize of @xmath77 to ensure that the number of stars in each bin is not too small and does not introduce a fitting bias @xcite .",
    "each of these ten mass functions with different starting points is shown when we compare our mass functions to observations .",
    "this procedure results in lowered number counts in the highest mass bins because only the most massive stars will fall into these bins as seen in the power - law mass function ( black dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : observations ] ) where a kink is visible around @xmath78 ( left panel ) and @xmath79 ( right panel ) respectively ( cf . convolution of a truncated horizontal line with a box function with the width of the bins ) .",
    "this kink is caused by the binning procedure .",
    "importantly , the observations , our models and the power - law mass functions in figs .",
    "[ fig : observations ] and [ fig : sfh ] are binned identically to render the mass functions comparable .",
    "for a meaningful comparison of the modelled with the observed mass functions , the star cluster and the observations thereof need to fulfil certain criteria . they should be    * between @xmath80 and @xmath81 in age such that the wind mass loss peak in the mass function is present ( see below and * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , * massive enough such that the mass function samples the largest masses * homogeneously analysed , with a complete _ present - day _ mass function above @xmath82 .",
    "both , the arches and quintuplet clusters fulfil all criteria and are therefore chosen for our analysis .    other possible star clusters , which can be analysed in principle , are the galactic center cluster , ngc  3603  yc , westerlund  1 and r136 in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "trumpler  14 and trumpler  16 in the galactic carina nebula are not massive enough and rather an ob star association with stars of different ages , respectively . for westerlund  1 @xcite and ngc  3603  yc @xcite ,",
    "present - day mass functions were recently derived .",
    "a brief inspection of these results shows that both clusters may be suitable for an analysis as performed here for the arches and quintuplet clusters .",
    "we will investigate this further in the near future .",
    "possibly , ngc  3603  yc is too young such that its mass function is not yet altered enough by stellar evolution to apply our analysis .",
    "the initially most massive stars in a cluster end their life first .",
    "this depopulates the high mass end of the stellar mass function . before that , however , massive stars lose a significant fraction of their initial mass because of strong stellar winds ; e.g. our @xmath21 star at solar metallicity loses about @xmath83 during core hydrogen burning .",
    "stellar wind mass loss shifts the top of the mass function towards lower masses and a peak accumulates near its high mass end ( figs .",
    "[ fig : models]a and [ fig : models]b ) .",
    "the location of the peak depends strongly on the cluster age and provides a clock to age - date a star cluster .",
    "stars in close binary systems exchange mass with their companion either by mass transfer or in a stellar merger . _",
    "a fraction _ of stars gain mass , producing a tail at the high mass end of the mass function ( hatched regions in fig .",
    "[ fig : models]b ) which extends beyond the most massive single - stars ( fig .",
    "[ fig : models]a ) by up to a factor of about two . the mass gainers _ appear _ younger than genuine single stars because their convectively mixed stellar core grows upon mass accretion and mixes fresh fuel into their centre , thereby turning their clock backwards .",
    "furthermore , the most massive gainers reach masses which , when interpreted as single stars , have lifetimes that are shorter than the cluster age  they are the massive counterpart of classical blue straggler stars @xcite .",
    "the mass functions of the cores of the arches ( @xmath84 ) and quintuplet ( @xmath85 ) clusters reveal both the stellar wind mass loss peak and the tail because of binary mass exchange . compared to a power - law , we find that the arches and quintuplet mass functions are overpopulated in the ranges @xmath86 to @xmath87 ( @xmath88@xmath89 ) and @xmath90 to @xmath91 ( @xmath92@xmath93 ) , respectively ( fig .  [",
    "fig : observations ] ) .",
    "these peaks are well reproduced by our models ( figs .",
    "[ fig : models ] and [ fig : observations ] ) .",
    "we can thus determine the cluster age because among the stars in the peak are the initially most massive stars that are ( a ) still on but about to leave the main sequence and ( b ) unaffected by binary interactions ( we refer to them as turn - off stars in analogy to their position close to the turn - off in a hertzsprung - russell diagram ) .",
    "the majority of stars in the peak are turn - off stars but there are small contributions from unresolved and post - interaction binaries ( see * ? ? ?",
    "a correction for wind mass loss then reveals the initial mass of the turn - off stars and hence the age of the cluster .",
    "we can correct for wind mass loss by redistributing the number of excess stars in the peak @xmath94 such that the mass function is homogeneously filled for masses larger than those of the peak stars up to a maximum mass , the initial mass of the turn - off stars @xmath95 .",
    "the number of excess stars is then @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the present - day mass of the turn - off stars , which can be directly read - off from the upper mass end of the peak , and @xmath98 the initial mass function as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammadef ] ) .",
    "the initial mass of the turn - off stars @xmath95 and hence the cluster age follows from integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : number - excess - stars ] ) , @xmath99 the normalisations , @xmath22 , of the mass functions to be filled up with the excess stars , @xmath94 , ( dotted , power - law functions in fig .  [ fig : observations ] ) are @xmath100 and @xmath101 for arches and quintuplet , respectively , with slopes of @xmath42 in both cases ( see discussion below for why the mass functions are so flat ) .",
    "it is difficult to read - off the exact value of @xmath97 from the observed mass functions because of the binning .",
    "but from binning our modelled mass functions in the same way as the observations , we know that @xmath97 corresponds to the mass shortly after the peak reached its local maximum ( cf . the vertical dashed lines in figs .  [ fig : models ] and  [ fig : observations ] ) .",
    "depending on the exact value of @xmath97 , @xmath102@xmath103 in arches and @xmath104@xmath105 in quintuplet , we find @xmath106@xmath107 and @xmath76@xmath108 excess stars in the peaks of the arches and quintuplet mass functions , respectively .",
    "these numbers of excess stars result in turn - off masses @xmath95 of @xmath109@xmath110 and @xmath111@xmath112 and hence ages of @xmath113@xmath114 and @xmath115@xmath116 for the arches and quintuplet clusters , respectively .",
    "these are only first , rough age estimates that will be refined below and their ranges stem from the uncertainty in reading - off @xmath97 from the observed mass functions .    from the difference between the initial and present day masses of the turn - off stars in arches and quintuplet",
    ", we can directly measure the amount of mass lost by these stars through stellar winds .",
    "the turn - off stars in arches lost about @xmath106@xmath117 and the turn - off stars in quintuplet about @xmath118@xmath119 during their ms evolution .",
    "this is a new method to measure stellar wind mass loss which does not require measurements of stellar wind mass loss rates and can therefore be used to constrain these .",
    "more accurately , we determine the ages of the arches and quintuplet clusters by fitting our population synthesis models ( sec .  [",
    "sec : methods ] ) to the observed mass functions .",
    "first , we fit power - law functions to the observed mass functions in mass regimes in which they are observationally complete and not influenced by stellar wind mass loss ( @xmath120 and @xmath121 , respectively ) .",
    "binary effects are also negligible because stars with such masses are essentially unevolved at the present cluster ages .",
    "this fit gives the normalisation and a first estimate of the slope of the mass function .",
    "we then vary the mass function slope , the cluster age and the primordial binary fraction in our models simultaneously such that the least - square deviation from the observations is minimised .",
    "our best - fit models are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : observations ] together with the observed mass functions .",
    "we find slopes of @xmath42 , ages of @xmath122 and @xmath123 and primordial binary fractions of @xmath49 and @xmath50 for the arches and quintuplet cluster , respectively .",
    "the binary fractions are less robust and may be the same within uncertainties because we do not take the uncertain masses of the wnh stars into account . while our mass function fits contribute to the age uncertainties by only @xmath124 , its major part , @xmath125 and @xmath126 for arches and quintuplet , respectively , is due to observational uncertainties in stellar masses of @xmath127 ( sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "massive stars tend to sink towards the cluster cores because of dynamical friction ( mass segregation ) , thereby flattening the mass function of stars in the core .",
    "the derived mass function slopes of @xmath42 are flatter than the typical salpeter slope of @xmath36 @xcite because we investigate only the mass segregated central regions of both clusters , i.e. a subsample of stars biased towards larger masses .    in our models ( fig .  [ fig : models ] ) , the tail of the arches mass function contains about @xmath128 unresolved , pre - interaction binaries with @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) and about @xmath32 with @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) . for quintuplet ,",

    "the age discrepancy between the most luminous cluster members , the wn and the less luminous o stars , accounts for about @xmath141 and @xmath142 , respectively , which is eliminated by our method .",
    "our ages of @xmath122 and @xmath123 for the arches and quintuplet clusters , respectively , agree with the ages derived from the o  stars and dismiss the proposed younger ages from the brightest stars as a result of neglecting binary interactions .",
    "the most famous member of the quintuplet , the pistol star , is such an example because it appears to be younger than @xmath143 assuming single - star evolution @xcite .",
    "the initial mass of the primary star , the mass ratio and the orbital period of a binary system determine when mass transfer starts , with more massive and/or closer binaries interacting earlier .",
    "stochastic effects caused by the limited stellar mass budget prevent the formation of all possible binaries in a stellar cluster , i.e. binaries with all possible combinations of primary mass , mass ratio and orbital period .",
    "the likelihood that a binary in a given cluster interacts , e.g. after @xmath64 , and that the binary product becomes then the most massive star depends thus on the number of binary stars in that cluster , hence on the total cluster mass . using monte carlo simulations , we investigate the influence of stochastic sampling and binary evolution on the most massive stars in young star clusters ( cf .",

    "our findings have implications for the maximum mass problem . the arches cluster is older than previously thought and its most massive stars are most likely binary products . the mass function is thus truncated by finite stellar lifetimes and not by an upper mass limit . to constrain a potential stellar upper mass limit",

    "the upper mass limit is thus likely in the range @xmath11@xmath12 , thereby solving the maximum mass problem .",
    "we conclude that the most massive stars in the universe may be the rejuvenated products of binary mass transfer . because of their extreme mass and luminosity , radiation feedback from these stars is crucial to observable properties of young stellar populations , to the state of the interstellar medium around young stellar clusters and even to the reionization of the universe after the big bang .",
    "our results have strong implications for understanding star - forming regions nearby and at high redshift as observationally derived fundamental properties like initial mass functions are based on the assumption that the brightest stars are single and less massive than @xmath7 .",
    "these very massive stars are thought to die as pair - instability supernovae and produce huge , so far unaccounted contributions to the chemical enrichment of nearby and distant galaxies and their final explosions may be observable throughout the universe .",
