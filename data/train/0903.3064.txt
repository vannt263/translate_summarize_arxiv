    "many of the observed properties of elliptical galaxies indicate a violent formation history . they are dynamically hot systems , with high velocity dispersions dominating over ordered stellar streaming .",
    "gas - rich tidal tails , and rings and shells indicative of the recent disruption of a spiral galaxy , often surround systems otherwise resembling ordinary giant ellipticals @xcite .",
    "these observations first led @xcite to suggest that elliptical galaxies are the products of mergers between spirals .",
    "n - body simulations of mergers between disk galaxies generically reproduce many of the gross properties of observed ellipticals , including density profiles that follow the `` @xmath8 '' law in projection @xcite , flat rotation curves @xcite , slow rotation and anisotropic velocity distributions @xcite , and triaxial shapes @xcite . today",
    "we understand the toomre merger hypothesis within the broader context of hierarchical structure formation in the universe - in the favored @xmath9cdm cosmology , an elliptical galaxy - sized halo has typically suffered @xmath101 major merger since @xmath11 , the epoch over which the bulk of its stellar mass formed ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "observations of elliptical galaxies also show signatures of dissipation in their buildup .",
    "the phase space densities in the cores of ellipticals exceed the maximum densities in spirals , implying a violation of liouville s theorem if ellipticals arise from _ dissipationless _ spiral - spiral mergers @xcite .",
    "this problem is naturally resolved by a gas component that is driven to the center by tidal torques during the merger @xcite .",
    "elliptical galaxies also display kinematic features that are most easily explained as signatures of dissipation , such as rapid oblate rotation ( e.g. @xcite ) , embedded disks @xcite , and kinematically decoupled subsystems @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that a wide variety of the photometric and kinematic properties of observed ellipticals , including their half - light radii and velocity dispersions , flattening , isophotal shapes , velocity anisotropy , and major and minor axis rotation were much better reproduced by an ensemble of simulated 40% gas disk merger remnants than by the corresponding ensemble of dissipationless mergers .",
    "@xcite found that a gas fraction of @xmath1030% was needed to match the observed tilt in the `` fundamental plane '' @xcite , a value close to the typical gas fraction at @xmath12 .",
    "the violent relaxation in galaxy mergers is _ incomplete _ - substantial memory of the initial conditions is retained .",
    "for example the remnant may tend to rotate in the sense of the initial orbital angular momentum or disk spins @xcite , and an initial stellar metallicity gradient will be blurred but not erased during the merger @xcite .",
    "this incompleteness is enhanced by the presence of gas , which can form cold features in the stellar distribution relatively late in the merger process , which subsequently experience less violent relaxation than features present at the beginning of the merger .",
    "this fine structure provides a fossil record of the galaxy s formation history ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one way to parametrize the finer features in a galaxy s distribution function , which is well - suited to spectroscopic observations , is through the moments of the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) as a function of projected location in the galaxy . for continuous stellar line profiles ,",
    "these moments are measured by fitting the losvd to a gaussian multiplied by a truncated series of gauss - hermite ( gh ) basis functions @xmath13 , @xmath14,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the line - of - sight ( los ) velocity dispersion .",
    "this method is less sensitive to noise than computing the moments directly @xcite . for modest deviations from gaussianity",
    ", @xmath0 represents the skewness of the distribution ( see @xcite , fig .",
    "11.5 ) and can , for example , indicate whether the net rotation in a galaxy arises from the dominant orbit population , or a small group of streaming stars . the quantity @xmath1 measures the kurtosis ; positive @xmath1 values generally indicate a radial anisotropy in the velocity distribution , while negative @xmath1 indicates a tangential bias @xcite . in a non - rotating system",
    ", @xmath1 can distinguish between a dominant population of radial ( box ) orbits , and cancelling streams of high - angular momentum ( tube ) orbits .",
    "in recent years , integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) has made it possible to obtain high s / n , high - resolution 2d maps of the losvd in nearby ellipticals @xcite .",
    "schwarzschild modelling studies have shown that , in practice , the observed 2d maps of the first four moments of the velocity distribution , @xmath17 , are sufficient to uniquely reconstruct the full 3d stellar orbital distribution in most cases @xcite .",
    "patterns in the higher moments , @xmath18 , typically fall below the noise in the observations .",
    "it is therefore standard practice to truncate the gh series at @xmath19 , and encapsulate the non - gaussian shape of the distribution in the two parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "previous authors @xcite have observed that simulated gas - rich merger remnants occupy different areas of the @xmath20 planes from dissipationless disk - disk merger remnants .",
    "dissipationless remnants tend to show an overall positive correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath21 , while in gas - rich remnants , as in observed ellipticals @xcite , this correlation is negative .",
    "@xcite show that adding a bulge component to the merging disks can also yield larger @xmath0 values and a negative @xmath22 correlation , by allowing the disks to retain more of their initial angular momentum .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that the observed @xmath7 relation is too steep to be explained by two - integral oblate rotator models ( e.g. @xcite ) , but can easily be accounted for by the superposition of a hot stellar spheroid with a cold embedded disk .",
    "this type of distribution function arises naturally from a combination of violent relaxation and dissipation in gas - rich mergers of spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite performed a detailed study of the stellar orbit structure of 1:1 and 3:1 merger remnants with 0 and 10% gas , and its imprint on their photometric and kinematic properties .",
    "they found that the gas drives an exchange between box and short - axis tube orbits , making the remnants more oblate in shape .",
    "this suppression of box orbits strongly influences the shapes of the losvds , bringing the @xmath20 relations into better agreement with observed rapidly rotating ellipticals .",
    "@xcite showed that 2d kinematic maps of the same set of remnants display many of the intriguing features seen in real galaxies , including misaligned rotation , embedded disks , and kinematically decoupled cores .    in this paper",
    "we explore the effect of gas on the @xmath20 relations using a version of the tree / sph code gadget-2 @xcite that includes star formation , radiative cooling , and feedback from supernovae and agn @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of real - time star formation allows us to consider the higher gas fractions typical of spiral galaxies at the peak elliptical formation epoch , @xmath23 at @xmath24 . for fixed @xmath3 , the dissipative signature on the dynamics",
    "may be reduced by star formation , if the gas is converted to collisionless material early on in the merger .",
    "the dissipational features may also be more spatially extended when star formation is included .",
    "we simulate a representative series of mergers between equal - mass , milky way - sized disk galaxies at a series of initial gas fractions ranging from 0 to 40% , as well as re - mergers of the spheroidal remnants .",
    "we quantify the dependence of the @xmath20 diagrams on @xmath3 , and explain the patterns that we find in terms of the underlying stellar orbital distribution .",
    "our primary goals are : ( a ) to see whether this diagnostic points to the same typical gas fraction as other indicators , such as the fp tilt and peak quasar redshift ; ( b ) to locate `` wet '' ( gas - rich disk - disk ) and `` dry '' ( re - mergers of gas - poor spheroid ) mergers in @xmath25 space , with the aim of distinguishing these two populations in ifs observations ; and ( c ) to connect the observed trends in the non - gaussian moments with the underlying orbit structure typical of merger remnants in an intuitive way .",
    "our initial galaxy models consist of exponential disks embedded in hernquist ( 1990 ) dark matter halos , with masses comparable to the milky way .",
    "the galaxy models are described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the halo concentration and spin parameter were set to @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the disk mass was 4.1% of the halo mass , and its specific angular momentum was assumed equal to that of the halo .",
    "the halo was realized with 120,000 particles , and 80,000 stars initially comprised the disk .",
    "a fraction @xmath3 of the disk stars were replaced with sph gas particles at the start of the simulation , and this component could subsequently form new stars if a threshold density @xmath28 , tuned to match the schmidt law @xcite , was exceeded .",
    "the gravitational softening length was 140 pc , which set a minimum spatial resolution scale in the core .",
    "( see also @xcite for further description of the simulations . )",
    "the disks began at a separation of 100kpc , on parabolic orbits with a periapsis distance of 7.1kpc .",
    "they typically merged after around 1.5gyrs , and the simulations were run to a final time @xmath294.3 gyrs .",
    "@xcite show that the global remnant properties reach a steady state at one effective radius ( @xmath30 ) around 0.3gyrs after the merger , so by @xmath31 the remnants can safely be considered relaxed at this scale .",
    "the set of eight merger trajectories used in this study correspond to orbits @xmath32 in @xcite , chosen to uniformly sample the phase space of possible orbits @xcite .",
    "the series of eight representative disk - disk mergers was performed at seven different gas fractions , @xmath330 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 30 , and 40% .",
    "we also ran two series of re - mergers of the 20 and 40% gas remnants , intended to represent dry mergers of realistic gas - poor ellipticals .",
    "to produce a representative sample for each re - merger series , we randomly selected eight pairs from among the disk - disk merger remnants , and re - merged them on trajectories @xmath32 again .    for each of the simulated remnants we selected 100 random isotropically sampled viewing angles , and a synthetic 2d map of the kinematics",
    "was constructed within @xmath34 for each los .",
    "a constant mass - to - light ratio was assumed throughout the analysis . in each spatial bin",
    "we constructed a velocity histogram and extracted @xmath35 , @xmath16 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 by performing a least - squares fit to the 5-parameter function @xmath36 \\ { 1 & + & h_{3 } h_{3 } ( \\frac{y - v}{\\sigma } ) \\\\ & + & h_{4 } h_{4 } ( \\frac{y - v}{\\sigma } ) \\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the levenberg - marquardt method @xcite .",
    "we used 40 @xmath37 40 spatial bins and 80 velocity bins within @xmath38 .",
    "the gadget particles were smoothed over a radius @xmath39 , where @xmath40 corresponds to a seeing of 1.5 \" at 20mpc , and @xmath41 is a smoothing length based on the distance to the 128th nearest neighbor .",
    "this ensured that the effective particle count in each spatial bin was @xmath42 1000 . at @xmath31",
    "we also froze the potential , expanded it in the basis set of @xcite , and classified the orbits of the stellar particles in this potential .",
    "the results of this exercise are thoroughly presented in @xcite .",
    "our results for the @xmath7 relation are presented in fig .",
    "the shape of the distribution is quite sensitive to @xmath3 for the disk - disk merger remnants . at low gas fractions",
    "the overall correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath5 is weak ; the distribution has a diamond shape consisting of a flat , negatively correlated component plus a steep , positively correlated one .",
    "although the intrinsic structure changes rapidly from flattened , prolate - triaxial systems dominated by box orbits to rounder , more oblate systems dominated by short axis ( @xmath43 ) tube orbits as the gas fraction increases from 0 to 15% @xcite , there is no strong signature of this transformation in the asymmetric @xmath0 moment .    for @xmath44 the shape of the @xmath7 distribution changes rather abruptly . these gas - rich remnants are characterized by high @xmath0 moments that are strongly anti - correlated with @xmath5 , in better agreement with observed fast - rotator ellipticals @xcite .",
    "the observations thus favor typical progenitor gas fractions @xmath45 25% , in agreement with other indicators such as the shapes of the remnants @xcite , the two - component structure of ongoing mergers @xcite , cuspy @xcite and cored ellipticals @xcite , and the tilt of the fp @xcite . in the sauron data",
    "there is also evidence for a second population of fast rotators with low @xmath0 values @xcite ; these systems can not be explained by the simulations performed in this study .",
    "re - mergers of the high - gas fraction remnants still show a distinct negative correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath5 , but the remnant losvds are much more concentrated near the origin of the @xmath7 plane .",
    "note the much lower spread in re - merger @xmath0 values at @xmath46 compared to disk - disk mergers of any gas fraction .",
    "this result is not surprising , since violent relaxation in the re - merger tends to blur out structure in the distribution function and drive the losvds closer to a thermal distribution .",
    "1 quantifies the degree of thermalization in a single dry merger .    in fig .",
    "2 we illustrate how the positive and negatively correlated components arise in the low-@xmath3 remnants , and how the strong @xmath7 anti - correlation arises in the gas - rich ones . in dissipationless",
    "remnant @xmath47 ( top six panels ) , the major - axis ( @xmath48 ) tube orbits produce substantial minor axis rotation even though they only comprise @xmath1020% of the stellar mass within 1@xmath30 , since they are highly streaming . in a pixel near the minor axis in an edge - on projection ( looking along the intermediate axis )",
    ", @xmath48tubes dominate the luminosity , and when combined with the @xmath43tube and box orbits peaked at @xmath46 they result in a distribution with an extended tail in the direction opposite the mean velocity . since the velocity distribution of the @xmath49-tube orbits is",
    "not too strongly peaked , the @xmath0 value is not very high and the @xmath7 relation is relatively flat .",
    "when the same remnant is viewed face - on ( projected along the short axis ) , the three orbit classes are all piled on top of each other , and the streaming @xmath48tubes form a bump in the tail of the dominant distribution of boxes and @xmath43tubes .",
    "we thus get an extended tail in the same direction as the mean velocity , i.e. a positive @xmath22 correlation .",
    "this high-@xmath35 bump in the tail produces a stronger asymmetry in the losvd while the velocities in the face - on projection tend to be lower , so this effect produces a much steeper @xmath22 relation than the effect illustrated in the top row .",
    "the locus of face - on and edge - on projections in the @xmath7 diagram , averaged over all remnants of a given gas fraction , is shown in the bottom row of fig .",
    "2 . to illustrate the trends we show one set of low-@xmath3 disk - disk mergers , one set of high-@xmath3 disk - disk mergers , and one set of re - merger remnants .",
    "as indicated in the above example , face - on projections dominate a steep positively - correlated component , while edge - on projections dominate the shallower negatively correlated component .",
    "the positively correlated component is relatively suppressed at high gas fractions .    in gas - rich remnants the dominant population ( @xmath50-tube orbits )",
    "is streaming as in the edge - on dissipationless remnant , only now the streaming is much stronger .",
    "this effect arises from the embedded disk that re - forms after the merger out of the gas that did not lose its angular momentum and fall to the center @xcite .",
    "the red and blue dashed lines in the bottom losvd show the contribution from `` old '' stars put in as collisionless particles at the beginning of the simulation , and from the 15% of the new stars ( formed out of gas during the merger ) that formed latest .",
    "these late - forming stars comprise only a few percent of the total stellar mass , but are prominent in spatial bins lying along the major axis .",
    "these disk stars have a much lower velocity dispersion than the remnant as a whole , and produce a sharp high-@xmath35 peak in the dominant @xmath43tube population , giving a distribution that is strongly skewed in the sense opposite the mean velocity .    as a rule ,",
    "disk - disk mergers tend to produce large asymmetric deviations from gaussianity owing to subcomponents that retain memory of the initial streaming of the disk stars , and to gas that is redistributed and spun up through dissipation to form a thin embedded disk .",
    "the @xmath7 correlation is generally negative when the dominant orbit population tends to stream , and positive when the rotation is caused by sub - dominant streaming population superimposed on the tail of the dominant orbits .",
    "we now turn to the symmetric deviations of the losvds from a gaussian shape , measured by the `` kurtosis '' parameter @xmath1 . in fig .",
    "3 we present the @xmath51 relations from our simulations . for @xmath4%",
    "the @xmath51 distribution has a triangular shape that narrows sharply toward high positive @xmath1 .",
    "note that this is the naive expectation for a single population of tube orbits - viewed edge on the high - angular momentum orbits tend to pile up in the tails of the velocity distribution and any significant imbalance in the sense of their rotation produces a high @xmath5 , while viewed face - on they pile up in a peak around @xmath46 .",
    "however this pattern differs sharply from ifs observations , in which a mild increase in the @xmath5 spread is actually seen toward high @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "there is also a trend toward lower @xmath1 values as @xmath3 increases from 0 to 15% , arising from the conversion of box orbits into @xmath43tubes by the central mass concentration formed by the gas that falls to the center and produces the starburst @xcite .",
    "we get a marked change in the shape of the @xmath51 distribution at @xmath3 @xmath10 20% , as we did for the @xmath7 relation . at higher gas fractions",
    "we get strong positive as well as moderate negative @xmath1 values over a wide range in @xmath5 - the @xmath5 spread actually increases mildly toward high @xmath1 as in observed systems .    like the transformation in the @xmath7 distribution",
    ", this rapid transition owes to the appearance of a strong disk component starting at @xmath52% , as shown in fig .",
    "4 . in high-@xmath53 ,",
    "edge - on projections of the disk , @xmath1 is influenced by two competing effects - the strong negative kurtosis of the more isotropic population of old stars on @xmath43tube orbits , and the strongly peaked population of late - forming disk stars that tend to produce a positive @xmath1 in superposition with the old component . in the pixel shown in the top row of fig .",
    "4 , the latter effect wins out .",
    "although the old stellar @xmath43tube population has a negative kurtosis , the narrow superimposed peak from the late - formed disk gives the full losvd a net positive @xmath1 .",
    "this positive @xmath1 is greatly enhanced for the @xmath50-tube orbits alone . in the outer dotted pixel",
    "whose losvd is shown in the middle row , the disk component is somewhat weaker and the negative kurtosis of the old @xmath50-tube population wins , giving the full distribution a net negative @xmath1 .",
    "this example demonstrates how we may get a wide spread in @xmath1 , including strong positive as well as negative values , at high @xmath5 .",
    "we caution the reader that in this situation @xmath1 is quite sensitive to small changes in the disk strength , and the gh fitting is sensitive to noise , so care must be taken in quantitative comparisons between simulations and observations .    in the @xmath54 diagram",
    "the re - mergers are once again more concentrated around the origin , for the same reason discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "the smaller non - gaussian moments of the re - mergers at fixed @xmath5 suggest one way to separate re - merger remnants from other slow rotators .",
    "the re - mergers tend to have losvds with positive @xmath1 , also an expected signature of violent relaxation , which generally results in a radially - biased distribution function @xcite .",
    "face - on projections generically give high positive @xmath1 values , as both the box and @xmath43tube orbits are strongly peaked around @xmath46 in this projection .",
    "particularly strong positive @xmath1 values can arise in face - on views of gas - rich remnants since the latest - formed stars form a narrow peak centered on @xmath46 , as illustrated in the third row of fig .",
    "the bottom row of this figure shows the average locus of edge - on and face - projections in the @xmath5 plane - face - on projections dominate the high-@xmath1 , low @xmath5 part of the diagram , while edge - on projections dominate the high @xmath5 and low @xmath1 regions , as well as the high @xmath5 , high @xmath1 wings in the gas - rich remnants .",
    "mergers between spiral galaxies generically produce remnants with significantly non - gaussian losvds , owing to the presence of subcomponents that retain memory of the initial conditions .",
    "this effect is especially pronounced in mergers with @xmath6% where the dissipative component re - forms an embedded disk , producing a strong negative @xmath7 correlation and a wide spread of @xmath1 values at high @xmath5 .",
    "both of these features are in agreement with observations of elliptical galaxies @xcite .    upon closer examination",
    "the sauron fast - rotator population appears to consist of two subgroups , one with a steep @xmath55 correlation , and a second with low @xmath0 for all @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "a gas - rich major merger scenario can not account for the second group , which suggests that the two fast - rotator populations may differ in their formation mechanisms .",
    "dry mergers produce slowly rotating remnants with small @xmath0 and @xmath1 , as violent relaxation blurs features in the distribution function and partially thermalizes the local velocity distribution .",
    "this provides one way to distinguish dry merger remnants within the population of slowly rotating ellipticals . the large spread in @xmath0 and @xmath1 among the sauron slow rotators",
    "@xcite suggests that the slow rotators are _ not _ all dry merger remnants , as has been proposed to explain the fast - slow rotator dichotomy @xcite .    at fixed redshift",
    "a tight correlation is observed between the gas fraction and stellar mass of late - type galaxies , with @xmath3 varying from @xmath1050% at m@xmath56 m@xmath57 to @xmath1010% at m@xmath58 m@xmath57 at @xmath24 ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the @xmath3 labels in figs . 1 and 3 may therefore be taken loosely as a proxy for galaxy mass , and our gas - rich merger model predicts a variation in the @xmath59 relations with galaxy luminosity .    in this paper",
    "we considered only a very restricted set of merger models , namely binary 1:1 mergers of bulgeless disks .",
    "the embedded disk component in our remnants may be artificially pronounced because real galaxies would suffer subsequent harassment through minor mergers , interactions with satellites , and secular processes .",
    "some of the effects of increasing @xmath3 ( e.g. higher @xmath5 and @xmath0 ) can also be achieved by decreasing the merger mass ratio @xcite , and it is important to disentangle these trends .",
    "extensions of this work include varying the mass ratios and bulge fractions , simulating cosmologically - motivated merger sequences @xcite , and including secular heating processes .",
    "ultimately we hope to make rigorous statistical comparisons between large libraries of simulations and ifs data .",
    "this will require a careful consideration of observational selection biases as well as systematics associated with the gh fitting procedure in the presence of observational noise as well as particle discreteness in the simulations .",
    "this study motivates such work by illustrating how detailed 2d kinematic information can reveal the underlying orbit structure of elliptical galaxies , and place stronger constraints on models of their formation .",
    "we would like to thank bart willems for technical help , and glenn van de ven for useful discussions .",
    "this work was supported in part by a lindheimer postdoctoral fellowship at northwestern university .",
