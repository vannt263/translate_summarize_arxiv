    "ly@xmath2 sources are also a compelling probe of the cosmic dark ages leading up to reionization ",
    "see @xcite for a perspective on high-@xmath6 observations .",
    "historically , @xcite determined that galaxies from the first billion years after the big bang would be powerful emitters of ly@xmath2 photons , though observations of these sources eluded us for longer than expected .",
    "however , robust detections are becoming more regular , especially if the stellar mass is comparable to the milky way or the star formation rate  ( sfr ) is elevated ( e.g. sfr  @xmath9 ; * ? ? ?",

    "is reprocessed into ly@xmath2 photons ; however , because neutral hydrogen  ( hi ) is opaque to the ly@xmath2 line , many of these photons may be resonantly trapped , and consequently suffer significant dust absorption . despite these effects , observations have determined that the ly@xmath2 escape fraction ,  @xmath10 , actually increases at higher redshifts  @xcite . at some point , although the photons are no longer destroyed by dust , they are scattered out of the line of sight and some fraction of the ly@xmath2 emission is lost to the background as their sources become spatially extended ly@xmath2 haloes @xcite .",
    "various mechanisms have been explored to explain the unusually high @xmath10 of high-@xmath6 galaxies . in all likelihood",
    "this is a result of the complicated resonant line transfer , galactic structure , and peculiar dust properties .",
    "for example , multiple scatterings that facilitate excursions to the wings of the frequency profile ; large - scale flows that induce doppler shifts ; and the geometry of dense , dusty clouds within a clumpy interstellar medium that provide pathways for escape  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in this work ,",
    "we push these questions to the very first galaxies  ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "assessing the observability of such early ly@xmath2 sources is nontrivial . indeed , going to higher redshifts introduces physical effects that compete in either strengthening or attenuating the ly@xmath2 signal  @xcite . on one hand ,",
    "the intergalactic medium  ( igm ) becomes increasingly neutral at higher @xmath6 , resulting in a more difficult escape for ly@xmath2 photons @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the same igm also becomes increasingly devoid of dust @xcite .",
    "furthermore , population  iii ( so - called pop  iii ) stellar sources are predicted to have been more efficient ionizers , boosting the ly@xmath2 luminosity @xcite .",
    "the fact remains that high - redshift ly@xmath2 sources are being observed out to @xmath11 .",
    "still , many details regarding the epoch of reionization  ( eor ) , or the inhomogeneous phase transition around @xmath12 , are uncertain and may greatly affect interpretations of ly@xmath2 transfer through the igm @xcite .",
    "some of the most effective methods for identifying high - redshift objects involve the ly@xmath2 line .",
    "in particular , lyman - break galaxies  ( lbgs ) are generally massive galaxies for which neutral hydrogen produces a sharp drop in the spectra due to absorption @xcite .",
    "lyman-@xmath2 emitters  ( laes ) are young , less - massive galaxies with active star formation and strong ly@xmath2 emission @xcite .",
    "it is an important frontier to push ly@xmath2 selection methods towards the highest possible redshifts .",
    "for galaxies at @xmath13 the neutral fraction of the intervening igm increases enough for their spectra to yield complete absorption of photons blueward of the ly@xmath2 line .",
    "this is the well - known `` gunn - peterson trough '' @xcite which is characteristic of lbgs .",
    "however , these massive , evolved galaxies become increasingly rare at high redshifts .",
    "the lae luminosity function also declines as redshift increases , and the observed trend is robustly established for @xmath14 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and expected to continue beyond @xmath15 @xcite . because a strong detection of the highly - redshifted ly@xmath2 line requires the emitter to be young and relatively dust free  conditions which are naturally expected for the first galaxies  laes are likely their typical manifestation .",
    "high - redshift ly@xmath2 candidates must be followed up by spectroscopy in order to guard against false positives from foreground contaminants .",
    "fortunately , moderate- to high-@xmath6 surveys are underway that will dramatically increase the sample size of ly@xmath2 galaxies and better characterize their statistical properties . for example , the hobby - eberly telescope dark energy experiment ( hetdex ) is a large integral - field spectroscopic survey expected to detect a million laes @xcite .",
    "currently , there are several candidates at @xmath16  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with the highest spectroscopically - confirmed source announced at @xmath17 by @xcite .",
    "other records have been found using gamma - ray bursts  ( grbs ) , active galactic nuclei  ( agn ) , or ( sub-)mm observations of redshifted thermal dust emission @xcite .",
    "however , it is unclear how these other selection methods relate to ly@xmath2 predictions .",
    "such connections may complement ly@xmath2 observations , even if the phenomena originate from the luminous deaths of individual massive stars ( i.e. grbs ) or are not associated with a ` normal ' activity of the first galaxies ( e.g. agn or high amounts of dust ) .",
    "ly@xmath2 radiative transfer within the first galaxies is a timely problem because next - generation facilities will provide high resolution data by the end of the decade .",

    "the ly@xmath2 and 21-cm lines are related through the wouthuysen - field mechanism for which ly@xmath2 scatterings pump electrons into the excited hyperfine state , thereby coupling the spin and kinetic temperatures  @xcite . finally , an ideal complementary ly@xmath2 probe is encoded in the cosmic infrared background  ( cib ) because the integrated radiation from all background stars and galaxies has been redshifted to ir wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the ly@xmath2 contribution is seen through the correlation of sources across characteristic length scales ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "a number of authors have studied ly@xmath2 radiative transfer within different contexts .",
    "we have greatly benefited from and hope to add to the body of work in this area .",
    "a partial list of references include : @xcite .",
    "the state of the art is to apply post - processing radiative transfer to realistic hydrodynamical simulations , which is justified for many large scale systems .",
    "we use this method in conjunction with semi - analytic models to ascertain the feedback of ly@xmath2 radiation on the galactic assembly process .",
    "our focus on the very first galaxies , in their proper cosmological context , is different from previous research that has targeted more massive systems at redshifts close to , or after , reionization ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "such systems require a statistical description of ly@xmath2 transmission through the igm as described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "photons that scatter out of the line of sight due to the neutral fraction of the igm are effectively lost to the background .",
    "therefore , the observability of ly@xmath2 emitters will provide independent constraints on reionization @xcite .",
    "measurements of the ly@xmath2 flux from first galaxies depend heavily on the observed line of sight in addition to the properties of the host system and igm .",
    "therefore , rather than solving a potentially intractable transfer equation with complex angular dependence we take advantage of monte - carlo radiative transfer techniques to accurately build emergent spectral energy distributions  ( seds ) . in order to perform ly@xmath2 simulations",
    "we have developed a new massively parallel code called @xmath4  the @xmath0smic @xmath1yman-@xmath2 @xmath3ransfer code . in section  [ subsec :",

    "photons with frequencies close to the ly@xmath2 resonance line , corresponding to the transition from the first excited state  ( 2p ) to the ground state  ( 1s ) , may be absorbed and quickly re - emitted by neutral hydrogen .",
    "thus , in optically thick environments ( @xmath19 ) the main mechanism of spatial diffusion is by the rare excursion to the lorentz wing of the spectral line .",
    "the cross section  @xmath20 and number density @xmath21 describe the optical depth  @xmath22 along a photon s path : @xmath23 where @xmath24 specifies the frequency dependence .",
    "it is often convenient to express frequency in a dimensionless manner as the number of doppler widths from line centre @xmath25 where @xmath26  hz is the frequency of ly@xmath2 and the thermal doppler width of the profile is @xmath27 .",
    "the thermal velocity in terms of @xmath28 is @xmath29 furthermore , if the natural ly@xmath2 line width is @xmath30  hz then the ` damping parameter ' represents the relative broadening of the natural line width : @xmath31 therefore , the final cross section is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the oscillator strength of the ly@xmath2 transition and the hjerting - voigt function  @xmath34 is the dimensionless convolution of lorentzian and maxwellian distributions , @xmath35 for reference , we define the cross section at line centre as @xmath36  @xmath37 . for a region of constant density  @xmath21  such as a cell in a computational domain  the integral in equation  ( [ eq : tau ] ) simplifies to @xmath38    typically , the parameter  @xmath39 is much less than unity so the hjerting - voigt function is dominated in the centre by a resonant scattering doppler core , @xmath40 , and the wings are dominated by the lorentzian component , @xmath41 .",
    "if the approximate frequency marking the crossover from core to wing is denoted by @xmath42 , i.e. where @xmath43 , then the hjerting - voigt function is roughly @xmath44 see sections  [ subsub : h_approx ]  and  [ subsub : x_cw_approx ] for a more rigorous discussion as well as numerical approximations for @xmath34 and @xmath42 . for most conditions with significant neutral hydrogen density",
    "the gas is optically thick to core photons .",
    "however , in the wing , @xmath34 can be quite small allowing a photon to escape with greater ease .",
    "the approximate optical depth for a wing photon is then @xmath45 which is independent of temperature as is immediately apparent when written in terms of the doppler velocity @xmath46 .",
    "note the relation between doppler frequency and velocity : @xmath47 .",
    "regions of high column density , @xmath48  pc  @xmath49  @xmath50 , may produce very high opacities .",
    "the trapped ly@xmath2 photons are therefore exposed to greater extinction from dust .",
    "this may be best measured by the optical depth at line centre , which has moderate temperature dependence and can be read from equation  ( [ eq : tauh ] ) as @xmath51~t_4^{-1/2}$ ] .",
    "the @xmath4 code is based on previous monte - carlo radiative transfer ( mcrt ) algorithms ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the code reads initial conditions of velocity , density , and temperature for each cell of a three - dimensional grid employing adaptive mesh refinement  ( amr ) . sampling the ly@xmath2 emission profile of high opacity systems is possible because acceleration schemes avoid unnecessary computations , e.g. frequent core scatterings .",
    "additionally , @xmath4 is massively parallel allowing a greater number of photon packets and therefore less statistical error .",
    "section  [ sec : methodology ] outlines the general methodology for a ly@xmath2 transport code while section  [ sec : schemes ] describes the specific implementations used in @xmath4 .",
    "while the monte - carlo method for ly@xmath2 radiative transfer is fairly standard , each portion of section  [ sec : schemes ] contains significant discussion or numerical schemes unique to this work .      in order to sample ly@xmath2 observables",
    "we apply the method described below to individual photon packets . depending on the desired resolution and physical setup a large number of packets",
    "may be necessary to obtain statistical convergence .",
    "unless otherwise specified the number of photon packets in each simulation is @xmath52 .",
    "the initial spatial distribution of ly@xmath2 photons is based on the physical setup , i.e. initial conditions .",
    "the first mechanism for producing ly@xmath2 line emission is interstellar recombination as a result of ionizing radiation from hot stars .",
    "the second mechanism is collisional excitation of neutral hydrogen , usually resulting from shocks caused by accretion or supernovae .",
    "an initialization criterion accounts for photoionizing sources and diffuse emission , both of which may be significant for atomic cooling haloes .",
    "however , throughout this work we choose to initialize photons from the central location @xmath53 .",
    "the initial direction  @xmath54 of each photon is drawn from an isotropic distribution in the rest frame of the embedded source . for convenience ,",
    "velocities are expressed in terms of the thermal velocity : @xmath55 the photon is emitted at the natural frequency of the ly@xmath2 photon  @xmath56 in the rest frame of the atom . to obtain the initial frequency  @xmath57 in the moving frame of ambient gas",
    "we apply a doppler shift appropriate to the velocity of the atom  @xmath58 @xcite @xmath59 to be explicit , @xmath56 is drawn from a lorentzian distribution and the components of @xmath60 are each taken from a maxwellian distribution describing the thermal motion of the ambient gas .",
    "although we use the expression in equation  ( [ eq : init_freq ] ) , the memory of @xmath57 is quickly lost by multiple scattering events , so for optically thick environments one may simply inject the photon at line centre , or @xmath61 .",
    "the propagation distance of any photon is determined by the optical depth  @xmath22 drawn from an exponential distribution .",
    "this is because the mean optical depth @xmath62 defines the mean free path  @xmath63 , or the average distance a photon can travel without being absorbed ( or scattered ) by the intervening medium  @xcite .",
    "therefore , travel beyond each mean free path becomes less and less probable .",
    "formally , the mean free path is then @xmath64 .    from equation  ( [ eq : tau ] )",
    "the respective optical depths of infinitesimal paths are @xmath65 so the probability of _ no _ interaction is @xmath66 . with @xmath67 partitions of @xmath68 , the numerical representation of discrete intervals ,",
    "the probability distribution function over the total path is the product @xmath69 which has been normalized so that @xmath70 .",
    "the cumulative distribution function is the integrated distribution defined by @xmath71 , which can be inverted to give the optical depth at which an interaction event occurs , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is drawn from a univariate distribution .    to perform cartesian - like ray tracing",
    ", the monte - carlo method selects a photon with an optical depth  @xmath74 according to equation  ( [ eq : lnr ] ) . because individual cells are regions of uniform density we may equate this with the calculated optical depth  @xmath75 from equation  ( [ eq : tauh ] ) to find the propagation distance , i.e. @xmath76 provides @xmath77",
    ". however , this often leads to a scattering which is outside the original cell .",
    "therefore , we first calculate the optical depth required to travel through the cell : @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the distance from the current position to the point where the photon exits the cell .",
    "if @xmath80 the ` spent ' optical depth is subtracted from the current optical depth , i.e. @xmath81 .",
    "likewise , the current position is updated to @xmath82 and ray tracing continues through the next cell .",
    "as photons traverse from cell to cell the temperature  @xmath83 and ambient bulk velocity  @xmath84 may change .",
    "therefore , doppler shifting induces terms of @xmath85 corresponding to a nonrelativistic lorentz transformation , i.e. one where @xmath86 .",
    "additionally , the frequency differs between cells due to the @xmath87 scaling relation .",
    "the frequency in the new ( primed ) cell is then @xmath88    if @xmath89 the optical depth is ` exhausted ' in the current cell and the photon undergoes a scattering event .",
    "the propagation distance is recalculated according to the remaining optical depth , i.e. @xmath90 $ ] .",
    "the position is advanced by @xmath91 in the @xmath54 direction and the algorithm proceeds to update the frequency and direction as described in section  [ sec : scatter ] .",
    "the photon ray traces along a new direction with each subsequent scattering until it ultimately escapes the computational domain .",
    "a scattering event changes the photon s frequency according to the atom s velocity  @xmath60 , the final  @xmath92 and initial  @xmath54 directions , and a small recoil effect to satisfy conservation of momentum @xmath93 the recoil parameter  @xmath94 is defined as ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath95 which is included but negligible for the applications of this paper .",
    "the velocity of the scattering atom is most conveniently expressed in terms of its parallel  @xmath96 and perpendicular  @xmath97 components .",
    "the perpendicular magnitudes are unbiased by the photon s frequency and are therefore drawn from a gaussian , i.e. @xmath98 . however , the magnitude of the parallel velocity @xmath99 is affected by the presence of the resonance line .",
    "the distribution function for @xmath100 depends on frequency as the convolution of a gaussian with a doppler - shifted lorentzian peak : @xmath101 which highly favors velocities with @xmath102 for core photons . for wing photons",
    "( @xmath103 ) , however , the probability that an atom has a high enough velocity to doppler shift into resonance becomes vanishingly small , so @xmath104 becomes increasingly gaussian .",
    "the angle  @xmath105 between the incident and outgoing scattering directions is governed by the phase ( probability ) function @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the degree of polarization for @xmath108 scattering . due to the physical symmetry",
    "the phase function is independent of the azimuthal angle @xmath109 . for core photons with @xmath110 the electron transition to the @xmath111 state results in isotropic scattering , i.e. @xmath112 , while the @xmath113 transition results in polarization with @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "since a quantum state with angular momentum  @xmath115 has a spin multiplicity of @xmath116 , ly@xmath2 photons in the core are excited to the @xmath111 state with @xmath117 probability and the @xmath113 state with @xmath118 probability .",
    "nonresonant wing photons on the other hand are dominated by rayleigh scattering because their wavelength is much larger than the bohr radius , @xmath119 , therefore the resultant polarization is maximal , i.e. @xmath120 @xcite .",
