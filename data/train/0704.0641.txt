    "<S> s    the deterministic generation of collimated single and entangled photons is of crucial importance in quantum information , like in quantum cryptography @xcite , quantum computation @xcite , quantum lithography @xcite or quantum interferometry @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the engineering of quantum states in atomic systems is now possible thanks to the experimental progress experienced by the field of atomic physics during the last years . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , with trapped ions it has been already possible to create so  called w @xcite and ghz @xcite states of up to 8 ions . at the same time , scientists have been able to produce other kinds of entangled states @xcite with atoms in optical lattices . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , with the advent of rydberg techniques @xcite it will soon be possible to create w  like states in that system or in atomic ensembles at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> apart from their fundamental interest , some of those states may have applications in precision spectroscopy @xcite .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we show that the ability of creating those atomic states may have a strong impact in different subfields of quantum information , as it may lead to a very efficient way of creating certain kind of entangled photonic states which are required in various applications . </S>",
    "<S> the main idea is to use a laser and an internal level configuration such that we can map the atomic state onto photonic states corresponding to modes propagating in a well defined direction . </S>",
    "<S> our scheme uses the well known fact @xcite that , under certain circumstances , light scattering takes place predominantly in the forward direction due to an interference effect . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , this effect is the basis of one of the building blocks of the repeater scheme proposed in @xcite , and has been recently demonstrated in a series of experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there , a single excitation is created in an atomic ensemble by detecting a photon emission in a certain direction . </S>",
    "<S> then , the excitation is released in the forward direction by using a laser . </S>",
    "<S> building on this fact , we propose to create certain kind of excitations by using quantum gates or atomic interactions , which give rise to the desired entangled states when they are released using a laser , and which propagate in the desired direction due to the mentioned interference effect .    </S>",

    "<S> ( [ multi.w.state ] ) defines a set of orthonormal collective states with @xmath11 atoms excited in @xmath12 and linear momentum @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> those states can be indeed readily created using trapped ions or rydberg techniques ( see appendix [ mps],[rydberg ] ) . in order to release the photons , </S>",
    "<S> one sends a laser pulse of wavevector @xmath14 which couples level @xmath15 to some electronically excited ones @xmath16 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the large population of level @xmath1 together with the initial entanglement ( coherences ) between the atoms , will now stimulate the emission of photons from the excited states to the level @xmath17 , which overall will produce the mapping between these states and the photonic states , @xmath18 that is , ( [ multi.w.state ] ) is mapped to a fock state of @xmath11 photons with momenta @xmath19 and polarization @xmath20 , where @xmath20 is the polarization of the light in each decay channel . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , due to the linearity of this process , superpositions of states of the form ( [ multi.w.state ] ) will be mapped onto superpositions of photonic states ( [ mapping ] ) . for example </S>",
    "<S> , the atomic state @xmath21 will emit a pair of entangled photons in different directions . </S>",
    "<S> the mapping ( [ mapping ] ) is strictly valid under ideal conditions , and in the limit @xmath22 , and the directionality in the photon emission is directly connected to the momentum conservation which , in turn , is a consequence of the constructive interference in the field emitted by each atom . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the crucial issue in our scheme is to determine how this mapping is modified in finite atomic ensembles under nonideal conditions . in the following we analyze such questions in detail , concentrating in the simplest case in which we have a single excitation with momentum @xmath23 in @xmath24 ( </S>",

    "<S> most usually ions are arranged in chains , such that we deal with the 1d situation discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> even though trapped ions are not equally spaced , under the condition @xmath71 , with @xmath72 the average distance , we still get light emission in the forward  scattering cone only , see fig . </S>",

    "<S> ion distances are usually in the range of a few @xmath74 , and thus condition @xmath39 is not fulfilled when considering optical wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> a way out of this problem is to use optical transitions which lie in the range of @xmath75 , which can be found in ions such as hg@xmath76 , ba@xmath76 , or yb@xmath76 @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> _ the very same techniques which can be applied to rydberg atoms in an optical lattice can also be used in the case of hot ensembles . on the one hand , this setup has the advantage that atoms do not need to be cooled and placed in an optical lattice . on the other hand , it can be described by a statistical distribution of particles , and thus suffers from the fact that high efficiency in the release of photons is achieved under more severe conditions of particle density and atom number , as discussed above . </S>",
