    "in their seminal paper @xcite bohigas giannoni and schmit conjectured that the local energy spectrum statistics of quantum systems with fully chaotic classical dynamics are universal and can be described by standard ensembles of random matrix theory ( rmt ) . to explore the origin of such universality semiclassical techniques based on the applications of the gutzwiller trace formula",
    "was introduced by berry in  @xcite . by this approach",
    "the correlations between energy levels of a quantum hamiltonian system can be related to the correlations between periodic orbit actions in the corresponding classical system . within the diagonal approximation , where only correlations between periodic orbits themselves are taken into account , berry managed to obtain the leading order of the universal spectral form factor .",
    "the diagonal approximation , however , turned out to be insufficient to reproduce full rmt result , whose derivation had remained a distinguished challenge for yet a long time  @xcite . the breakthrough was achieved in 2001 when sieber and richter discovered a non - trivial mechanism of correlations between periodic orbit actions  @xcite .",
    "they showed that the next to the leading order term of the universal spectral form factor can be obtained by taking into account correlations between long periodic orbits with one self - crossing under a small angle ( usually referred as _ encounter _ ) and the ass !",
    "ociated partner orbits , see fig .",
    "[ sieber_richter]a .",
    "such pairs of orbits have close actions and contribute systematically into the spectral correlations .",
    "later , this approach was extended to include correlations between periodic orbits having an arbitrary number of encounters which culminated in the derivation of the full rmt result @xcite .    in a nutshell",
    "sieber - richter pairs and its many - encounter analogs are nothing more then bunches of periodic orbits running through almost the same points of the phase space up to the switch in the momentum direction .",
    "furthermore , in the case of broken time reversal symmetry only orbits passing close to each other with the same momentum direction are of relevance , see fig .",
    "[ sieber_richter]b . in the present paper",
    "we restrict consideration only to the latter case . due to the hyperbolic nature of the dynamics",
    "the action difference between such trajectories is small and determined by the lengths of the encounters . equally important , the correlation mechanism of sieber - richter pairs is robust to perturbations of the dynamical system . in fact , any hyperbolic system contains a large number of long periodic orbits with close actions which are not of sieber - richter type .",
    "however , it might be expected that , in general , the differences between their actions fluctuate enormously under perturbations of the system .",
    "therefore , the contribution from a generic pair of periodic orbits is washed out after averaging ( e.g. , over ensemble of systems ) and only pairs of sieber - richter type contribute systematically to the spectral correlations .",
    "a)0.5 cm b )    the robustness of sieber - richter correlation mechanism can be easily understood by considering symbolic dynamics of the system . assuming that a finite markov partition exists , any periodic orbit can be encoded by a finite sequence of symbols @xmath6 from some alphabet @xcite .",
    "the fact that two periodic orbits come close to each other in the phase space has a natural interpretation on the level of the corresponding symbol sequences .",
    "namely , let @xmath7 and @xmath8 be two sequences of length @xmath9 such that any subsequence of length @xmath10 occurs in @xmath7 exactly the same number of times as in @xmath8 .",
    "this property of sequences @xmath7 and @xmath8 is referred below as _",
    "@xmath10-closeness_. it is straightforward to see that any pair of @xmath10-close sequences defines in fact a pair of periodic orbits which are close with respect to the euclidean metric of the phase space .",
    "their metric closeness is controlled by @xmath10 : the larger parameter @xmath10 is , the closer two periodic orbits approach each other .",
    "accordingly , all periodic orbits of the system can be organized into a disjoint union of _ clusters _ of @xmath10-close orbits .",
    "each cluster is composed of periodic orbits with close actions running through approximately the same points of the phase space in a different time order .    motivated by the application to quantum chaos , questions regarding the number of periodic trajectories with close actions / lengths were previously addressed both in physics and mathematics literature in the context of several different models of chaotic dynamical systems : geodesics flows on manifolds of negative curvature @xcite , billiards @xcite , quantum maps @xcite and quantum graphs @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we study the phenomenon of clustering of periodic orbits on the level of symbolic dynamics .",
    "our consideration is restricted to the simplest possible grammar assuming a two - letter alphabet , @xmath11 , and absence of pruning , i.e. each symbol in the sequence can be followed by any other symbol .",
    "these grammar rules is met , for instance , in the baker s",
    "map  @xcite .",
    "the main question to be addressed below can be informally stated as follows : given an integer @xmath10 , what is the probability that a randomly picked up periodic sequence ( equiv . orbit ) of length @xmath9 has a certain number of @xmath10-close partners when @xmath9 is large enough ?",
    "in what follows we consider clustering of periodic orbits within the paradigm model of chaotic system  the baker s map @xmath12 . explicitly , the action of @xmath12 on the points @xmath13 of the two - dimensional phase space @xmath14 is given by : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 play the role of the coordinate and momentum respectively , see e.g. , @xcite for details .",
    "the baker s map has an advantage of having a particularly simple symbolic dynamics .",
    "this allows to avoid cumbersome notation and makes the exposition more transparent .",
    "symbolic dynamics is a standard tool widely used in the theory of hyperbolic dynamical systems . by this approach each point of the system phase space",
    "is identified with a sequence of symbols from a certain alphabet .",
    "given such a representation the time evolution of the system takes a simple form .    to introduce symbolic dynamics",
    "it is necessary first to define markov partition of the phase space @xmath18 .",
    "a standard choice for the baker s map is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "then any point @xmath22 can be uniquely encoded by a two - sided sequence @xmath23 of zeros and ones : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath11 using a simple algorithm : @xmath26 if @xmath27 and @xmath28 if @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",

    "the `` past '' history of @xmath32 and the momentum @xmath17 are defined by @xmath36 subsequence : @xmath37 .    within the above symbolic representation the time evolution of the system",
    "is given by the shift map @xmath38\\to[\\dots x_{-1}x_{0}x_1.x_2 x_3\\dots],\\ ] ] which moves the separation point `` @xmath39 '' between the future and the past in the sequence of symbols step by step .",
    "all infinite periodic sequences composed of one and the same finite piece @xmath40 correspond to periodic orbits of the system . here and below symbol @xmath41 stands for the set of all possible sequences of zeroes and ones having the length @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath42 denotes the periodic orbit of the backer s map associated with the sequence @xmath40 .",

    "we will also consider the quotient set @xmath48 with respect to the cyclic shift @xmath49 .",

    "in other words , each @xmath80 corresponds to a set of sequences from @xmath78 which are related to each other by a cyclic shift .",
    "the second property of @xmath68 allows to organize the clusters of periodic sequences in a tree like structure . the @xmath10-th level of the tree contains clusters of @xmath10-close periodic sequences , see figs .  [ fig2],[fig1 ] .",

    "and we come to the conclusion that the space @xmath50 ( or equivalently the space of periodic orbits ) acquires a natural ultrametric structure .",
    "the primary goal of the present paper is to understand how the distribution of the cluster sizes @xmath86 depends on the level @xmath10 in the limit @xmath87 . to this end",
