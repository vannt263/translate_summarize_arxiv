    "the remnants of the protoplanetary disk , now in the form of trans - neptunian objects ( tnos ) , offer a unique way to study the evolution of the solar system .",
    "the tno size distribution is defined by its initial properties , collisional history , and the formation and evolution of the giant planets @xcite .",
    "the orbital dynamics of the tnos is largely governed by interactions with neptune , and the radial distribution of tnos also depends on the giant planets evolution ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the radial extent of tnos was truncated by a close passage of a star during the early stages of the solar system formation @xcite .",
    "a number of large - scale investigations that will significantly advance our understanding of the outer solar system are currently being designed , tested , and executed .",
    "pan - starrs  @xcite , given its coverage of the sky and time baseline , promises an accurate determination of the statistical properties of the trans - neptunian region .",
    "lsst  @xcite and skymapper  @xcite will extend the surveyed sky to the southern hemisphere .",
    "the new horizons ( nh ) mission will give unprecedented views of the trans - neptunian space by approaching pluto and other tnos in mid-2015 . nevertheless , there remain important questions that will not be answered by these studies .",
    "these large synoptic surveys will necessarily have a shallow limiting magnitude .",
    "deep surveys like this will continue to be the only window into the smallest and farthest objects in the solar system .",
    "the answers to these questions can influence how these projects are carried out and how their resulting data are interpreted .",
    "the distribution of faint objects will matter when large surveys choose fields to be covered more deeply .",
    "the tno size distribution and radial extent of tnos are among the questions that will rely on pencil - beam surveys to be answered .",
    "since the discovery of 1992  qb@xmath19  @xcite a number of wide - field surveys for tnos have been completed @xcite .",
    "in addition to determining much of the dynamical structure of the trans - neptunian region and identifying large , bright tnos that are amenable to follow up observations , these surveys constrain the bright end ( @xmath1@xmath2024 ) of the cumulative luminosity function of tnos , the number of objects per square degree brighter than a given magnitude .",
    "this quantity has consistently been measured to be a power law of the form @xmath21 where @xmath3@xmath1623 is the magnitude at which one expects 1 object per square degree and @xmath5 is the slope of the distribution .",
    "ground based efforts have also focused on detecting fainter tnos with deeper imaging of narrow areas of the sky .",
    "many have been successfully conducted in recent years @xcite .",
    "these surveys have been concentrated near the ecliptic plane and reach limiting magnitudes as faint as @xmath1@xmath1626 .",
    "these surveys also find that the cumulative surface density of tnos is consistent with a single power law .",
    "however , the deepest search to date , using the _ hubble space telescope _ with the _ advanced camera for surveys _ and reaching a 50% detection efficiency at magnitude @xmath1=28.5 , found 25 times fewer objects than expected from extrapolating the brighter ( @xmath1@xmath2225 ) distribution  @xcite .",
    "their result indicates there is a break in the cumulative surface density of objects near @xmath1@xmath1625 .",
    "@xcite necessarily relied upon the results of other surveys to assess the deviation of the cumulative density of objects from a single power law over a range of magnitudes .",
    "however , it is difficult to combine the results of different surveys to obtain a well - calibrated sample of the trans - neptunian population .",
    "dynamical biases in latitude and longitude , change the local density of objects and the relative abundances of excited and classical objects depending on the direction in which a survey is conducted .",
    "this can be seen in the variety of results found in the literature ; a nice re - analysis and summary of some surveys is presented by @xcite .",
    "different surveys sample a variety of ecliptic latitudes and longitudes , use various analysis methods , or vary in observing conditions .",
    "it is necessary to determine and correct for the effects of these differences to characterize the physical and dynamical properties of the tno population . for bright tnos",
    ", large synoptic surveys will determine many of the biases in the observations as well as in the population itself .",
    "however , for fainter tnos , the simplest way to overcome these difficulties is to observe a single region of the sky .",
    "all these surveys use the `` digital tracking '' method @xcite , by which a series of consecutive short exposures are digitally shifted and coadded to match the apparent motion of real objects .",
    "that method has proven very useful in improving the sensitivity of these ground and space based observations .",
    "however , this method relies on how fine the grid of velocities sampled is , the good quality of a template image to subtract from each exposure , extra processing of the images and a trained operator to filter false positive detections due to saturated stars or other artifacts .",
    "our results were obtained by linking detections in three different images described in  [ sec : mod ] .",
    "our method s data reduction is more direct , requires less human interaction and is easier to photometrically calibrate .",
    "the radial extent of the classical tno population is not known with certainty .",
    "although there is evidence for a sudden decrease in density at @xmath23 @xcite , the existence of a second farther population near the ecliptic is difficult to rule out , due to the bias against detection of more distant , fainter objects .",
    "we are slightly more sensible to distant , slower moving objects .",
    "since we do not rely on the construction of a template field , usually made with data taken on the same night , that increases the noise and would subtract signal from very slow movers .",
    "the objectives of this work are to better constrain the expected break in the tno luminosity function using a single survey and to better understand the lack of detections at large heliocentric distances . in the next section",
    "we describe the data and the processing of images . in   [ sec : mod ] we present our moving object detection algorithm .",
    "we discuss the control population and detection efficiency of our method in   [ sec : effic ] . in the final two section we present the results of our survey and",
    "disucss their implications for the size and distance distribution of the tno population .",
    "the observations considered in this project were taken on ut 2003 august 29 and 30 with suprime - cam  @xcite mounted on the subaru telescope .",
    "suprime - cam is a mosaic camera with 10 ccds , each with 2048 @xmath24 4096 pixels .",
    "each mosaic image has a field of view of @xmath25 .",
    "we used smoka , the electronic archive of the subaru telescope  @xcite , to retrieve observations taken in august 2003 in the vicinity of uranus , near opposition .",
    "the fields were originally observed by @xcite .",
    "they surveyed a total of 14 fields , with an areal coverage of @xmath26 over the course of two nights .",
    "all exposures were taken with the `` cousins r '' red filter , well - matched to the colors of outer solar system objects .",
    "the objective of the original investigation was to discover uranian irregular satellites .",
    "@xcite recovered all previously known uranian irregular satellites and discovered two new such satellites .",
    "the faintest satellites detected have magnitudes at r@xmath1625.5 @xcite . on the first night",
    ", the observers took two or three exposures of @xmath167 min of each field , separated by half an hour on the first night .",
    "they re - observed those fields with two exposures during the second night , with the pointings shifted to maintain the same positions relative to uranus .",
    "the survey was designed to discover objects during the first night and to obtain better orbital information using the second night s data .",
    "we chose this particular data set for the following reasons .",
    "the data set is sensitive to @xmath27 magnitude objects , in the magnitude range in which @xcite find the break in the tno cumulative function to be .",
    "this sensitivity is reached in a single exposure , avoiding the difficulties associated with combining different images .",
    "there are 11 fields ( @xmath0 ) with 3 exposures on the first night , permitting a simple search for moving objects .",
    "the fields were observed very close to opposition , allowing a reliable distance estimate from the rate of motion with only a 24 hr arc .",
    "the sky coverage is large enough to expect the discovery of @xmath16100 tnos , allowing a significant constraint on the cumulative luminosity function .",
    "finally , the data were easily obtained from the smoka system , after the 18 month proprietary period .",
    "we performed the usual calibration of the images .",
    "for every image , we performed an overscan correction , trimming , bias frame subtraction , and flat - field division using standard iraf routines .",
    "calibration frames taken during these observations were obtained from smoka .",
    "the apparent motion of outer solar system objects viewed near opposition is primarily due to the earth s translation . for objects at the distance of uranus the apparent motion",
    "can be as large as @xmath166@xmath28 .",
    "for tnos this rate is typically @xmath163@xmath28 .",
    "this motion , with respect to background stars , is readily detected even in the short ( @xmath161 hour ) time baseline of this dataset .",
    "to find tnos , centaurs , and irregular satellites in this data set , we use a variant of the search algorithm described and implemented by @xcite .",
    "this method is similar to that used in other tno surveys ( for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the algorithm detects moving objects by comparing the positions of all point sources in each of three images of a patch of sky taken in the same night .",
    "thus , as mentioned earlier , we restricted our search to the 11 fields for which there were 3 images taken on the first night .",
    "the individual steps in the algorithm are as follows .",
    "first , for each search field we determine an astrometric solution for the first image of the night .",
    "these astrometric solutions are used later to guide the insertion of synthetic moving objects .",
    "we used the 2mass point source catalog  @xcite as an astrometric reference .",
    "the rms in the astrometric solution was typically of @xmath29 or lower ( close to the catalog s precision ) .",
    "the relative errors on the astrometric solutions for both nights were comparable to the tolerance of the search algorithm .",
    "we then register the second and third images with the first image of the night .",
    "this allows for very accurate positioning of stellar - like objects with respect to each other .",
    "this is done for the individual ccds , rather than for the entire mosaic .",
    "the successive ccds images are linearly interpolated , automatically , to the first using the positions of the background stars and routines available in the isis package  @xcite . when thse routines failed to converge ( due to numerous bad pixels or saturated stars ) , we align the images interactively using routines from iraf .    at this stage , we insert the population of synthetic objects that will be used to determine the detection efficiency of the search , as described in   [ sec : effic ] .",
    "we then use two different algorithms to search for point sources .",
    "the first of these is a wavelet transform source detection routine ( see @xcite for a description ) .",
    "the second is the publicly available sextractor package  @xcite , which calcuates the local image background rms , convolves the image with a user - specified kernel , and then identifies groups of pixels with values exceeding the background variation by a given value .",
    "these two approaches have very different false detection characteristics .",
    "thus , we consider the intersection of detections from both routines .",
    "( we use the flux information given by sextractor for the photometry described in   [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "we use a detection threshold of @xmath30 . for sextractor",
    "this corresponds to four adjacent pixels with values that are at least 1.3 times of the local background variation . at the end of this stage",
    ", there are three lists of sources , one list for each image .",
    "this results in up to @xmath1650,000 detection in each mosaic image .",
    "note that the expected motion of trans - neptunian objects during a single exposure ( @xmath167 minutes ) is small compared to the typical fwhm ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "thus , trailing does not significantly affect the source detection .    in order to identify moving objects among all the point source detected",
    ", we apply a series of filters that eliminate individual detections , as well as sequences of detections , that are not consistent with the tno population .",
    "we first reject all detections that corresponded to stationary objects , _",
    "i.e. _ stars and galaxies . for each list of detections , we eliminate those for which there is a corresponding detection within @xmath32 in at least one of the other two lists .",
    "we deliberately chose a small threshold in order to not diminish our sensitivity to very slow moving tnos .",
    "this stage typically reduces the number of detections to @xmath1610,000 per field .",
    "the next step is to search for linear motion among the non - stationary detections .",
    "we identify all groups of three detections in the successive images that are consistent with straight line motione ( within @xmath33 of the ecliptic ) , with a constant angular rate between 0.5 and @xmath34 .",
    "the parameter space is chosen to include the expected rate and direction of tnos .",
    "we consider all combinations of detections in the three different exposures whose fit to a line had an rms of @xmath35 or less .",
    "these criteria are met by @xmath161,600 combinations per field , nearly all of which are synthetic tnos ( see  [ sec : effic ] ) .    in the final stage , the search program outputs an image with all the combinations found , showing a stamp centered on every detection .",
    "we visually inspect these images to accept or reject a given object . images .",
    "this method allows the spurious and acceptable detections to be rapidly distinguished ( @xmath1630 min / field ) .",
    "typically @xmath1620 objects are rejected in this stage per field , the majority being optical artifacts , bad pixels , extended objects or some combination of the above .",
    "since our observations are flux - limited it necessary to account for detection biases when estimating the intrinsic number of tnos as a function of magnitude . we characterize our search using a population of synthetic tnos inserted just after the images have been calibrated and their astrometric solutions determined .",
    "the procedure is done for each mosaic field , rather than ccd by ccd .",
    "this process nicely accounts for the possible motion across detector boundaries .",
    "the same synthetic populations were used for the second night .",
    "we used the _ orbfit _",
    "routines @xcite to create a realistic population of synthetic tnos .",
    "the characteristics of the population were chosen to span the range of observational properties expected of the tnos .",
    "the position of an object on the sky at the time of the first exposure was drawn from a uniform distribution that encompassed the fov of the mosaic .",
    "objects were implanted with distances between @xmath36 and @xmath37 , or alternatively @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "the proper motion and radial velocity given to the object are taken from a distribution that encompasses the possible rates found in the solar system .",
    "this initial position and velocity vectors are only accepted if they correspond to a bound orbit .",
    "if so , we use the _ orbfit _ routines to calculate the ra and dec of the object at the beginning and end times of each exposure .",
    "we translate these sky positions into locations on the mosaic using the astrometric solution derived earlier .    for each exposure we compute a model for the psf .",
    "the model is the average of @xmath1610 bright , isolated stars for every ccd .",
    "given the known magnitude of the synthetic tno and the measured zero point , and accounting for transparency changes through changes in the flux measured in the psf stars , we use iraf routine to insert psfs with this flux at the calculated positions .",
    "we inserted objects from 22.5 to 26.5 mag , which spans the magnitudes of the tno population we expect to find .",
    "the flux of each object includes photon noise .",
    "we did not consider variable objects , as this is unlikely to be significant on @xmath161  hr time scales .",
    "we include the effect of trailing by dividing the flux among several psfs inserted at positions linearly interpolated between those at the beginning and end of the exposures .",
    "this process takes into account any background , transparency , seeing , and focus variations that might affect the limiting magnitude . using this psf model from each image",
    ", we implant a set of @xmath162,000 objects per field .",
    "this results in a sufficient number of synthetic objects per ccd to sample the detection efficiency as a function of position .",
    "since we are counting objects up to a certain brightness and our model describes the underlying tno population , it is essential to estimate what fraction of the population we detect as a function of magnitude . in figure",
    "[ fig : effofmag ] we include a histogram of the fraction of objects that were recovered in each magnitude bin .",
    "we implanted 25,074 objects in 11 fields , recovering 17,195 of them .    when plotting the cumulative function we used the local efficiency function , each detection is weighed by the number of objects recovered in the same field and within the observational magnitude error .",
    "the detection efficiency could vary from field to field .",
    "since all fields were taken in the vicinity of uranus , efficiency could depend on location . however , its statistical effect was negligible on the efficiency .",
    "for the statistical analysis the effective efficiency function will need to be integrated . since it is simpler to integrate analytical expressions , we used the total efficiency function , that considers all fields . following @xcite ,",
    "we represent it by @xmath40 where the best fit values are @xmath41=@xmath42 , @xmath43=@xmath2 , @xmath44=@xmath45 and @xmath46=@xmath47 .",
    "the errors were obtained with a markov chain monte carlo simulation .",
    "the parameter @xmath41 corresponds to the maximum efficiency , achieved for bright objects .",
    "@xmath43 corresponds to the magnitude at which the detection efficiency drops to half the maximum values .",
    "the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath46 characterize the abruptness of the decline of the detection efficiency .",
    "figure  [ fig : effofmag ] shows the average efficiency function for our data set .",
    "the efficiency could also depend on the rate of motion .",
    "we construct a rate - analog to the magnitude efficiency ( see ) .",
    "the detection efficiency is nearly indepedent of rate , but our method is slightly less efficient at larger rates . a faster moving object that is detected in the first image has a greater chance of falling close to a background star , or moving outside the field of view , thus the detection efficiency declines with the rate of motion .",
    "the lowest bin plot in is @xmath48 . since we implanted objects to have a population with a constant surface density",
    "that bin is not well sampled . even though we were able to recover objects planted with rates as slow as @xmath38 ( parallax for objects at @xmath37 ) we consider a more conservative limit .",
    "the rate at which an object moves 1-fwhm in 45 minutes , the shortest separation between the first and third exposure , is @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .    to properly account for detection biases , both real and control objects must go through exactly the same validation procedure . we did not unveil the fake object list until all objects were recognized as moving objects , either real or planted",
    "we found 92 moving objects , five corresponding to known irregular uranian satellites ( those found by @xcite and @xcite ) , five to centaurs , and 82 to tnos .",
    "the satellites that were missed were blended with stars in one of the images and hence were not found by our algorithm .",
    "we present our detections in table [ tab : fits ] . for each tno , we list its internal designation , its position at the time of the first exposure ( also listed ) , and its estimated magnitude with uncertainties ( along with an independent estimate of the photometric uncertainty )",
    ". we also list the measured sky plane rates of motion of the tno , two estimates of the distance to the tno ( one suited for two night s data and another based only on parallax , both explained later ) , its orbital inclination , and separation from uranus at the time of discovery .",
    "three standard stars @xcite were used to obtain the zero point and airmass dependence of the photometry .",
    "these were pg2213 - 006c ( v=@xmath51 , v - r=@xmath52 ) sa-92 - 417 ( v=@xmath53 , v - r=@xmath54 ) and sa-92 - 347 ( v=@xmath55 , v - r=@xmath56 ) .",
    "since their colors are similar to those of typical tnos @xcite we did not apply a color correction .",
    "we checked both nights were photometric and stable .",
    "the possible dependence on seeing ( fwhm ) was also investigated , finding it to be unimportant .",
    "the correction term was negligible compared to the airmass correction .",
    "every detection s magnitude is calculated , using the following formula : @xmath57 where @xmath58 corresponds to the flux in a 5-pixel aperture , @xmath59 is the time in seconds and @xmath60 is the airmass .",
    "this equation accounts for an average 0.34  mag aperture correction between the known magnitude of a synthetic object and its magnitude measured with a 5-pixel aperture .",
    "the search algorithm requires an object to be found in all three exposures giving three independent magnitude measurements that we average to obtain the results shown in table [ tab : fits ] .",
    "the errors given on the magnitude values correspond to the error on the flux .    in figure",
    "[ fig : magerr ] we plot the photometric errors , showing them to be @xmath160.1 mag .",
    "the magnitude dependence of the uncertainty is shown in figure  [ fig : magerrofmag ] .",
    "we estimate the uncertainties empirically , calculating the standard deviation as a function of magnitude .",
    "we then fit a second degree polynomial , overlayed in figure  [ fig : magerrofmag ] .",
    "this estimate is shown for each real object as @xmath61 in table [ tab : fits ] .",
    "we can accurately approximate the apparent motion of a tno over 24 hours as a straight line with a constant rate .",
    "we include the measured right ascension and declination rates in table [ tab : fits ] .",
    "the apparent motion of our objects compared with that which parallels the ecliptic is plotted in .    near opposition ,",
    "the change in the rate or direction of motion over 24 hours is negligible , making it easy to predict where the real objects would be on the second night .",
    "however , nine objects were not found on the second night .",
    "our method is only @xmath62 efficient for the brightest objects on the first night , with 10% lost to blending with field stars .",
    "it is expected that more than 10% of the objects will be lost on the second night , because of confusion with stationary sources and because they are more likely to move outside the field of view over 24 hours .",
    "we used the observations on the second night to improve the distance determination when possible .",
    "we use the @xcite _ orbfit _ routines to estimate plausible orbital elements assuming there s no acceleration in the direction tangential to the plane of the sky . for a 24-hout arc , this results in a @xmath167% accuracy in the barycentric distance ( @xmath63 ) . for a single night observation of objects the error on the distance",
    "could be unbound .",
    "however , since the observations were taken near opposition we are able to readily estimate heliocentric distances ( @xmath64 ) from the `` parallactic motion '' .",
    "we assume that the observations are taken exactly at opposition and that the orbits are circular .",
    "this distance estimate is not as reliable as @xmath63 but it serves as a consistency check .",
    "the probability of our data ( @xmath65 ) given a model for the intrinsic population ( @xmath66 ) is denoted @xmath67=@xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the likelihood function .",
    "we consider the data in our survey as a collection of @xmath70 detections with measured magnitudes . as derived in @xcite if @xmath71 is the expected number of detections between @xmath72 and @xmath73 , then the likelihood of a set @xmath74 where @xmath75=@xmath76 is : @xmath77 \\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n g(m_i)dm.\\ ] ] we are interested in characterizing @xmath78 .",
    "as described in @xcite , we can think of @xmath78 as being the probability of detecting an object and assigning it a magnitude @xmath72 given the survey characteristics and the real distribution of objects on the sky .",
    "we consider an intrinsic differential surface density of objects @xmath79 that only depends on magnitude and is constant over the observed area as the model @xmath66 . for a survey with an efficiency function @xmath80 , a function of magnitude only , we can write @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the solid angle of the survey .    the likelihood of a model for the differential surface density @xmath83 is then given by : @xmath84 this is the probability of finding each object in the set of observations at its measured magnitude , scaled by the probability of not finding anything else .",
    "the function @xmath85 is the probability an object is given a magnitude @xmath74 given its intrinsic magnitude is @xmath72 .",
    "if we consider the efficiency function and model it as relatively linear over the magnitude uncertainty of an observation we can approximate our likelihood function as follows : @xmath86 this is extremely useful when dealing with a large number of objects and surveys .",
    "we compared the behavior of both exact and approximate likelihood functions with our data and found no noticeable differences .    if we want to sample the likelihood function over its parameter space or calculate the total likelihood of a model we need to consider priors .",
    "that is , the probability of a parameter @xmath87 given a certain model @xmath66 , @xmath88 .",
    "these priors reflect any knowledge we have over the value of a parameter previous to our survey .",
    "we chose priors that reflect the least previous knowledge into the analysis .",
    "we chose uniform functions between limits set by our survey , indicating our ignorance of those parameters .",
    "the total probability of a model is : @xmath89 we can compare two competing models using their total likelihoods by computing the odds ratio : @xmath90 the last equality holds if we do not have a good reason to prefer `` a priori '' any of the two models .",
    "the ratio of the total likelihoods is called bayes factor .",
    "one of our goals is to determine whether the results of our survey indicate that the cumulative surface density can be modeled by a single power law distribution ( spl ) or if the data favor a more complicated model .",
    "we use a likelihood analysis to investigate this .",
    "the likelihood function is related to both the detection efficiency of the survey and the differential surface density @xmath91 .",
    "the important observation for the analysis is the number of objects we detect brighter than a given magnitude , namely the cumulative surface density : @xmath92=@xmath93 .",
    "we use the likelihood function given by eq .  [",
    "eqn : lik ] , with @xmath82=@xmath94 and @xmath95 given by eq .",
    "[ eqn : eff ] .    for every object we model its photometric uncertainty using the analytical model we considered previously , a gaussian ( @xmath96 ) around its measured magnitude ( see figure [ fig : magerrofmag ] ) .",
    "the single power law model is written as follows : @xmath97 in figure [ fig : like1 ] we plot the spl likelihood as a function of @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "the previously accepted values for the spl parameters ( @xmath5=0.76 , @xmath3=23.3 ) @xcite are in strong disagreement with our data , lying well outside our 3-@xmath79 confidence region .",
    "most of the surveys that have consistently measured a slope of @xmath5@xmath160.7 for the cumulative distribution have brighter limiting magnitudes @xcite .",
    "the exceptions are @xcite and @xcite , who quote a magnitude limit of @xmath1=25.9 and @xmath1=25.6 respectively .",
    "@xcite performed a search complete to @xmath1=28.5 .",
    "they discovered far too few objects to be consistent with a spl .",
    "we check that our bright end sample is consistent with the previous surveys with shallower limiting magnitudes . in figure",
    "[ fig : like1_cut ] we plot our sample s likelihood function after imposing an artificial efficiency limit at @xmath1=24.5 .",
    "the power law index is clearly consistent with the @xcite result and it shows our sample does not deviate from the spl behavior observed by others for magnitudes brighter than @xmath1@xmath1624.5 .    to show that the deviation from a spl at fainter magnitudes is not an artifact of our efficiency function , we repeated the experiment but instead imposed an artificial break at @xmath1=25.2 , where our survey is @xmath98 as efficient as its maximum efficiency .",
    "the result can be seen in @xmath99 , it shows the @xcite result is rejected at the @xmath100-@xmath79 level .",
    "now that we have shown that our results are not well modeled by an spl , we test a more complicated model .",
    "any model that includes a break in the surface density distribution will have more free parameters than an spl .",
    "alternatives with three and four parameters were tried by @xcite to explain the aforementioned under - abundance of detections .",
    "we will focus on the `` double power law '' ( dpl ) model , the harmonic mean of two different power laws .",
    "though a model with three parameters would be easier to implement , it does not provide the immediate insight into the tno population that the dpl provides .",
    "the dpl has four free parameters , allowing two different asymptotic power law behaviors for the distribution ( that can be linked to the size distribution of small and large objects ) , a break in the luminosity distribution , and a differential density constant .",
    "the larger number of parameters makes the likelihood function more difficult to sample , thus we use a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) approach ( for an mcmc review see @xcite ) .",
    "we use a metropolis - hastings algorithm to sample the likelihood function with a gaussian proposal distribution .",
    "the parameters were set to yield a @xmath1625% acceptance rate .",

    "given the small number of bright tnos detected in our survey , the limited constraint on @xmath7 is not surprising .",
    "using the detection efficiency ( ) we can estimate the number of objects we missed for each object found .",
    "we construct a cumulative function of the unbiased population plotting each object individually , representing with its detection a number of objects with similar magnitudes .",
    "since we are plotting a cumulative function , the errors are correlated ( see ) .",
    "we go on to compare the total likelihood of both models , as described in   [ sec : stat ] . a simple way of doing this is to examine the goodness - of - fit of the cumulative number density .",

    "it is expected that a dpl gives a better fit to the data than a spl model .",
    "the question is whether this better fit overcomes the increased complexity in the model .",
    "this can be answered calculating the quotient of the total bayesian probabilities of the models ( bayes factor , details in appendix [ sec : stat ] ) .",
    "if the total probability for a given model is larger than another then it is preferred . using the results of the mcmc simulations we compute this factor .",

    "@xmath114 differs from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 2 ) in the exclusion of the two widest searches and the inclusion of two newer surveys @xcite , as well as ours .",
    "we excluded the two surveys because of the complexity in establishing the searched area near the ecliptic .",
    "for the sake of comparison with @xcite we use the same criteria regarding detected objects as well as the caveats provided therein .",
    "we included surveys for which the location of the searched area , effective area of the search , magnitude at which the efficiency drops by 50% must be given .",
    "we include objects that have an observed magnitude where their efficiency function is more than @xmath115 the maximum efficiency of the survey .",
    "we point out that all our detections satisfy this requirement .",
    "we are interested in computing the likelihood of a model given the data from each survey . for this",
    "we only need the list of objects that meet our criteria , an estimate of the efficiency function , the surveyed area , and a way to translate all measurements to the red filter r for each survey .",
    "we use the approximation given in ( ) .",
    "figure [ fig : cumfuncall ] shows the 333 objects that we considered .",
    "it shows the existence of a very pronounced lack of detections at faint magnitudes .",
    "our likelihood analysis is summarized in @xmath116 with 1-@xmath117confidence limits for the parameters .",
    "an interesting aspect of our search is that the data has been available since august 2003 .",
    "our survey s most likely distribution expects @xmath1612 detections for the _ hst _ field while @xmath118 were found .",
    "this provides independent support to the existence of a break in the tno luminosity function .",
    "we use the criteria in @xcite to identify `` classical '' and `` excited '' objects .",
    "tnos with distance at discovery @xmath119 between @xmath120 and @xmath121 and inclination @xmath122 are considered `` classical '' and the rest are considered `` excited '' . in table",
    "[ tab : surv ] we list each survey with the corresponding number of tnos in each category .",
    "this survey was considered by itself and together with the surveys in table [ tab : surv ] .",
    "we investigated how does the dpl luminosity function change when applied to the different populations .",
    "we repeated the mcmc analysis for both populations and for our survey and the combined survey .",
    "we also considered the priors used in @xcite , @xmath123 to constrain the parameter space .",
    "the results of the mcmc simulations are summarized in table [ tab : params ] .",
    "these results are very similar to those by @xcite .",
    "however , we have included three new surveys ( this survey and those by @xcite ) , two of which ( this survey , @xcite ) sample magnitudes fainter than @xmath1@xmath1625.5 where excited objects were specially under - sampled .      the size distribution is closely related to the distribution of apparent magnitudes .",
    "it is customary to assume all objects are located at the same distance and that the size distribution is a single power law and hence the cumulative brightness distribution is also a power law .",
    "the parameters of the two distributions are related by @xmath124 , where @xmath87 is the exponent of the differential size distribution ( @xmath125 ) and @xmath5 is the exponent of the spl cumulative luminosity function .    with our rough distance estimates and assuming a 4% albedo for tnos",
    ", we can compute the real size distribution of the objects in our survey ( we adopt @xmath126 for the r band magnitude of the sun ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : sizedist ] we show the cumulative size distribution for our survey .",
    "however , the typical error in distance @xmath167% translates into a 0.3 magnitude photometric error , triple the median photometric error in our survey ( see figure [ fig : magerr ] ) .",
    "thus , instead of repeating the statistical analysis for the size distribution directly , we transform our luminosity function into a size distribution assuming all objects are located at @xmath127 .",
    "the best dpl fits for the luminosity function are plotted as a function of size .",
    "the solid line is the fit to this survey and the dashed line corresponds to the fit to the surveys in table [ tab : surv ] .",
    "we also consider a toy model based on the dpl ; it corresponds to two power laws with index @xmath128 and @xmath129 that are joined at the size for which an object at @xmath127 would be observed to have magnitude @xmath14 .",
    "we plot the cumulative function of the toy models for both dpls to show the asymptotic behaviors as a light solid line and a light dashed line respectively , both are arbitrarily offset vertically for clarity . in figure",
    "[ fig : sizedist ] there is a clear agreement between the real size distribution and the fit for the dpl models indicates that the assumption that all tnos are at the same distance is justified .    in figure",
    "[ fig : dist ] we plot the distance and magnitude for each object .",
    "the distance corresponds to @xmath63 in table [ tab : fits ] with the exception of those objects that were not recovered on the second night for which we plot the circular orbit approximation ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "we consider only the subset of 73 objects with 24 hour arcs data , with a distance error of @xmath130 .",
    "all but two objects are located at less than @xmath17 from the sun , although we are able to detect @xmath131 tnos at distances of @xmath132 , with 50% efficiency .",
    "this lack of distant detections has been noted previously @xcite with the recurrent hint that there is an `` edge '' to the kuiper belt .",
    "given the size distribution that corresponds to our best fit luminosity function we are able to calculate the distance bias in our sample and obtain the real distance distribution .",
    "we follow the approach of @xcite .",
    "the true and observed distributions are related by @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the bias factor and @xmath135 is the tno size distribution .",
    "this is done for 10 magnitude bins between 22nd and 26th magnitude and independent estimates of the bias function are obtained .",
    "we used the average to test the effect of the dpl size distribution to the distance distribution of objects , as shown in @xmath136 .",
    "we see an abrupt drop in the abundance of objects at @xmath137@xmath1647@xmath18 , regardless of the size distribution considered , as has been described by others @xcite .",
    "however , a dpl size distribution gives a much tighter constraint on the existence of a distant population .",
    "this is due to its much shallower size distribution for small bodies as can be seen in the bias correction for the dpl for our survey and the one for all surveys .",
    "given the fact that we detect no objects farther than 50@xmath18 we can constrain the surface density @xmath138 of a different population located outside 50@xmath18 . at 95% confidence level ,",
    "the detection of no objects is consistent with an expectation of 3 detected objects .",
    "we calculated this for the observed population @xmath139 , where @xmath80 is the detection efficiency of our survey .",
    "we assume for simplicity that the size distribution of the distant population is the same as that we have measured for the objects in our survey .",
    "we will also assume that each object in the population is shifted to larger heliocentric distances by the same factor .",
    "it is useful to define the limit on a distant population at distance @xmath119 as the maximum fraction of the observed population s surface density that a population can have to be consistent with no detections .",
    "we denote this fraction as @xmath140 , following the notation in @xcite . for 60we find @xmath141 , compared to @xmath142 found by @xcite .",
    "our survey rejects another population with the same mass closer than @xmath143 .",
    "thus , we place a tight limit on the existance of a distant population .",
    "we support the conclusion of @xcite that if such a population exists , it is either substantially less massive than the observed classical kuiper belt or it is comprised of small bodies that are beyond our detection threshold .    using the inclination information in table [ tab :",
    "fits ] we can show the inclination distribution for the objects in our survey .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : inclination ] .",
    "this is very similar to the results in @xcite .",
    "we use the results of our mcmc analysis to estimate the total mass of tnos to which our survey is sensitive . at each step in",
    "the mcmc runs , we compute the mass that corresponds to the dpl parameters ( again , assuming a heliocentric distance of 42@xmath18 and a geometric albedo of 0.04 ) .",
    "we follow the parametrization used in @xcite : @xmath144    \\left[\\frac{d}{42\\au}\\right]^6    \\left[\\frac{p}{0.04}\\right]^{-3/2 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath145 kg = @xmath146 and @xmath147 is the fraction of objects from the given population that are located within @xmath82 .",
    "we consider the complete tno population and the classical and excited sub - samples .",
    "the dpl size distribution allows us to compute the value of the integral in equation [ eq : mass ] , however the total mass of a given population depends heavily on the mean values of the assumed physical parameters .",
    "the mass probability distribution is calculated assuming all other parameters are fixed .",
    "the uncertainties on the rest of the parameters ( density , albedo , distance and fraction in the surveyed area ) can be accounted for independently .",
    "we considered an effective area of @xmath148 from the ecliptic , giving @xmath82=21,600@xmath149 and that all objects in each population are located within that area ( @xmath147=1 ) .",
    "we have also assumed mean albedo @xmath150 , distance @xmath151 and density @xmath152 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : massdist ] the mass distribution is plotted for our survey alone ( solid lines ) and for the combination of all the surveys listed in table  [ tab : surv ] ( dot - dashed lines ) . in black",
    "we show the entire tno sample .",
    "the most probable mass in tnos for the combination of all surveys is @xmath153 while for our survey alone we obtain @xmath154 .",
    "these are consistent with each other and with the previous estimate by @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising since most of the mass is present in tnos with sizes comparable to the size at which the distribution breaks .",
    "the slight overabundace of tnos in our survey with respect to other surveys yields a higher mass for the tno population .",
    "it is important to note that in equation [ eq : mass ] the total mass diverges if either @xmath155 or @xmath156 .",
    "we also see in figure [ fig : massdist ] that for the results of our survey alone there is a long tail to higher masses .",
    "this is due to the poor constraint on the bright end of the tno luminosity function given the limited areal coverage of our survey ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "however , the combination of all surveys yields a better constraint , and we obtain convergent masses for all steps in our mcmc run .    when we consider the classical and excited populations separately the mass distributions change . in figure",
    "[ fig : massdist ] we show the mass in classical objects in green and that in excited objects in red .",
    "using all the surveys the mass in classical objects is very well constrained to be @xmath157 .",
    "based on our survey alone , we find @xmath158 .",
    "the overabundance of classical objects in our survey is responsible for that seen in the entire tno population .",
    "the mass in excited objects using all surveys is @xmath159 , larger than that found for the classical tnos and is also less well constrained , with a long tail to higher masses .",
    "this reflects the relatively poor constraint on the size distribution of excited objects , where the limits are set by what values for the exponent of the power law size distribution are considered to be physically plausible . with only 18 excited objects in our survey we have a very poor constraint on the individual dpl parameters .",
    "however , the mass is well constrained .",
    "we find @xmath160 , less than the mass in classical tnos .",
    "this is due to the relative under - abundance of excited objects in our survey .",
    "this can be explained by the fact the survey was conducted in the direction of uranus , separated about 18.5@xmath161 from neptune , where we expect plutinos to be near apocenter and hence faint and under - represented .",
    "we have presented a tno survey that is both deep ( @xmath43=25.6 ) and broad ( @xmath162.8@xmath149 ) , finding 82 tnos .",
    "the survey is very well characterized and simple , reaching its limiting magnitude in single exposures .",
    "we have studied the luminosity function of the tnos in our survey .",
    "we found a significant deviation from a single power law behavior in the cumulative function at @xmath1@xmath1625 .",
    "we have shown that our data are consistent with a single power law , and with many other shallower surveys , if we consider only objects brighter than @xmath1=24.5 .",
    "we have also demonstrated that the apparent deviation from a single power law is not an artifact of our detection efficiency .",
    "whether our data support a break in the luminosity function is a matter of statistical analysis .",
    "we compared two models , one where the distribution increases exponentially with a single power law and one where there are two different slopes in the sampled magnitude region , and compute the total probability of each model with bayesian statistics @xcite ( see details in section [ sec : stat ] ) .",
    "the ratio of the total likelihood for a double power law and a single power law model is @xmath1626 .",
    "this can be interpreted as the dpl model being 26 times more probable than the spl given our data set .",
    "we conclude that our survey provides significant evidence for a break in the tno luminosity function .",
    "this is the first survey that is able to make such a claim without relying upon the results of other surveys .",
    "our result is easy to interpret since we do not have to make assumptions about the distribution of objects in different parts of the sky .",
    "nonetheless , the comparison with other surveys is fundamental since there are published searches that sample the same magnitude region .",
    "we have considered most of the published data up to july 2007 regarding surveys of the trans - neptunian space in the same spirit of @xcite .",
    "again , our double power law model accurately describes the cumulative number density for all surveys combined .",
    "only two ground based surveys are as deep as the present , and they have not seen a significant deviation from a single power law .",
    "the survey of @xcite covered much less area and , consequently , discovered many fewer tnos in this magnitude range ( 17 objects for the entire survey ) .",
    "given the small numbers , our results are not inconsistent with those of @xcite .",
    "@xcite report the combined results of surveys taken at different ecliptic latitudes and longitudes .",
    "they fit for a single power law but account for variations in the sky surface density , that may be due to surveying at different ecliptic longitudes and latitudes , by allowing an offset in the luminosity function zeropoint for each survey .",
    "this substantially increases the number of free parameters and , we believe , allows deviations from a single power law within individual surveys to be obscured when the results of several surveys are combined .",
    "we believe that this explains the difference between the present results and those of @xcite .",
    "we make the assumption that all objects are located at the same distance , so the luminosity function can be translated into a size distribution . for",
    "every object with a reliable distance estimate a nominal size can be computed ( we assume an albedo of @xmath162=0.04 ) .",
    "the size distribution of our survey was compared with the single distance approximation and we showed they agree .",
    "we then interpret the dpl size distribution .",
    "the break in the size distribution reflects the size at which collisional processes take over gravitational ones .",
    "this is , the largest object that is expected to be disrupted in a collision in the age of the solar system .",
    "the best dpl model for our survey features a break at @xmath65=@xmath163 km bodies while for all surveys it is at @xmath65=@xmath164 km .",
    "current models expect the break to occur at smaller sizes , @xmath165 for @xcite and @xmath166 for @xcite .",
    "we consider these models to be consistent with our result given the assumptions on poorly constrained quantities like the albedos on the observational side as well as initial conditions in the theory are not well constrained . the effect of a distribution of albedos and a possible correlation with object size and heliocentric distances should be studied .",
    "the inclination distribution for our survey is consistent with what is expected from previous results @xcite .",
    "however , we do not have enough objects to do a detailed study of the distribution .",
    "we do , however , separate our population in classical ( `` cold '' ) and excited ( `` hot '' ) objects .",
    "we study the size distribution of these samples and find them to show differences as done previously by @xcite .",
    "we calculate the probability distribution for the total mass in tnos , classical and excited objects that are consistent with our observations and all considered surveys .",
    "for all surveys combined we find @xmath167 .",
    "it is interesting to note that for the classical population the mass is very well constrained to be @xmath157 while the excited population gives a larger and poorly constrained mass of @xmath159 .",
    "this provides evidence for a difference between the `` hot '' and `` cold '' populations .",
    "our survey gives a consistent but slightly higher answer for classical objects that we believe is due to the local overabundance of objects in our survey .",
    "we only have 18 excited objects in our sample , too few to constrain the parameters of the luminosity function , but enough to show there is an under - abundance of excited objects in our survey .",
    "this is explained by the direction of our fields , close to where most of the plutinos come to apocenter .",
    "given the size distribution we calculate a distance bias correction @xcite .",
    "we then obtain the real distance distribution of objects , assuming we are just as likely to find faint objects that are close as those that are far .",
    "our survey is very well suited to detecting objects that show slow parallactic movement ( distant ) ; our detection efficiency is essentially independent of rate for rates larger than @xmath49 ( distances closer than @xmath50 ) . according to @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite the fraction @xmath168 of objects found outside @xmath169",
    "should be about 40% for a population with a smooth brigthness distribution that extends beyond @xmath17 . in our sample",
    "there are 73 tnos with reliable distance estimates , of which 71 are located between @xmath170 and @xmath171 , and only two at @xmath16@xmath17 , accounting for @xmath168=3% .",
    "once we take into account the biases associated with distance these numbers indicate an abrupt drop in the radial density of the kuiper belt . if we also consider the size distribution break found in our sample we also rule out the existence of a far population of tnos near the plane of the ecliptic .",
    "we have found more evidence for an edge of the classical belt population at around @xmath171 and placed a constraint on the surface density of objects for an unseen population at @xmath172 of 8% that of the observed classical belt .",
    "we also set a minimum distance for a `` belt - like '' population with the same mass as that of the classical belt of @xmath143 .",
    "deeper surveys will help better constrain where the break in the luminosity function occurs and complete the picture of the trans - neptunian space .",
    "the size distribution would be better determined if these surveys are also careful in obtaining followup observations to measure accurate distances for faint objects .",

    "<S> the objects detected correspond to 82  tnos , five  centaurs , and five  irregular satellites . </S>",
    "<S> we model the cumulative number of tnos brighter than a given apparent magnitude with both a single and double power law . </S>",
    "<S> the best fit single power law , with one object per square degree at magnitude @xmath3=@xmath4 and a slope of @xmath5=@xmath6 , is inconsistent with the results of similar searches with shallower limiting magnitudes . </S>",
    "<S> the best fit double power law , with a bright - end slope @xmath7=@xmath8 , a faint - end slope @xmath9=@xmath10 , a differential number density at @xmath11 @xmath12=@xmath13 and a magnitude break in the slope at @xmath14=@xmath15 , is more likely than the single power law by a bayes factor of @xmath1626 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first survey with sufficient depth and areal coverage to identify the magnitude at which the break occurs without relying on the results of other surveys .    </S>",
    "<S> we estimate barycentric distances for the 73 objects that have 24  hr arcs ; only two have heliocentric distances as large as @xmath16@xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> we combine the distribution of observed distances with the size distribution that corresponds to a double power law luminosity function to set a tight constraint on the existence of a distant tno population . </S>",
    "<S> we can exclude such a population at 60@xmath18 , with 95% confidence , assuming it has the same size distribution and albedo as the observed tnos , if it exceeds 8% of mass of the observed tnos . </S>"
