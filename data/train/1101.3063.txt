    "physicists are now addressing problems very far from their traditional domain .",
    "even social phenomena are now ubiquitous in the research made by the statistical physicists  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the general framework of the statistical physics has been successfully applied to diverse interdisciplinary fields ranging from finance  @xcite , genetics  @xcite and biology  @xcite , to religion  @xcite , tournaments  @xcite , culinary  @xcite , and music  @xcite .",
    "naturally , in social phenomena the basic constituents of the system is the human .",
    "humans are known to have nontrivial collective dynamics , much more complicated than idealized physical interacting systems . moreover",
    ", even individual aspects related to social agents may not be available .",
    "this complex scenario is reflected , in some sense , in several human activities .",
    "for instance , elections  @xcite , collaborations between actors  @xcite and also between scientists  @xcite , phone text - message  @xcite , mail  @xcite or email  @xcite communication , human travel  @xcite , and collective listening habits  @xcite are just a few examples where complex structures have been found .",
    "most of the previous investigation deal with record data obtained directly or indirectly from the system , trying to extract some patterns or regularities about the system dynamics .",
    "this approach has been a trend towards investigating social phenomena and also complex systems in general  @xcite . within this framework",
    "the most diversified data were used as the sound . `` listen to '' the system dynamics may be both a simple task and a minimally invasive measurement . in this direction ,",
    "several studies focused on the sound time series have been done .",
    "just to mention a few : researches about the acoustic emission from crumpled paper  @xcite , from paper fracture  @xcite , and fractures in general  @xcite show several features related to critical phenomena , the power spectrum of music and speech sounds presents @xmath0-like spectra  @xcite and the normalized sound amplitude shows non - gaussian features  @xcite , traffic flows were investigated by using the sound noise revealing scaling and memory  @xcite , avalanches - like dynamics was found in the sound of popping bubbles in foams  @xcite and also in the lung sound  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we present an investigation about a very common situation related to human collective activities : the people agglomeration .",
    "human beings agglomerations can emerge in various places for different reasons , for example , people having lunch in restaurant , parties , and working meetings .",
    "in all these situations a common and notorious feature is perceptible : the resulting sound noise from these agglomerations . here , our main goal is to show that a nontrivial dynamic emerges when analyzing this kind of time series .",
    "in addition , employing a minimalist model we are able to reproduce statistical aspects of the empirical data . in the following ,",
    "we present the details about the data acquisition , the statistical analysis of the data , our minimal model , and finally we end with a summary .",
    "the observational data was obtained by recording the soundscape of people agglomeration in the recreation time at our university .",
    "the meeting point is an open place where the students spend time until the next class .",
    "all the measurements were made by using a condenser microphone ( shure microflex mx202w / n ) positioned in the central part of the agglomeration .",
    "we employed a sampling rate of 44.1 khz in order to cover the full audible human range ( approximately between 20 hz and 20 khz ) .",
    "additionally , the measurements were made during different periods in nine days totaling 16 records .",
    "the number of people during the recordings ranged approximately between 100 and 200 , and these variations does not significantly change the statistical results .",
    "typical recording times are about 10 minutes and along the recording the number of persons was approximately constant .",
    "we also analyzed 10 recordings from a web sound database finding similar results when compared with our measurements .",
    "figure [ fig : exp](a ) shows a representative record signal where we employed the normalized sound amplitude @xmath1 , i.e. , the sound amplitude subtracted by its mean value and divided by its standard deviation . figure [ fig : exp](b ) presents the sound intensity , @xmath2 , divided by its standard deviation . from these two figures",
    ", we can observe the existence of some bursts where the sound amplitude and the sound intensity exceed values much larger than their standard deviations .",
    "qualitatively , the origin of these extreme events may be , for instance , related to the fact that the people want to be heard , and if the neighbors are talking out loud they also have to increase the sound intensity .",
    "one of the most direct ways to characterize the sound amplitude is by evaluating its probability density function ( pdf ) .",
    "we show this analysis in figure [ fig : data](a ) for three typical recordings where we also plot one gaussian distribution with zero mean and unitary variance ( dashed line ) .",
    "a quite similar behavior has been found for all the other realizations of the experiment and also for the web recordings ( at least in the central part of the distribution ) .",
    "the empirical distribution clearly differs from the gaussian one , especially for larger values of the sound amplitude ( @xmath3 greater than four standard deviations ) . naturally , this heavy tail behavior reflects the presence of extreme events that we qualitatively see in figure [ fig : exp ] .",
    "a possible manner to investigate the dynamics of these extreme events is by evaluating the time interval between them .",
    "these time intervals can be obtained by considering a threshold value @xmath4 and storing all the initial time @xmath5 for which the normalized sound intensity is above this edge .",
    "the difference between two consecutive times @xmath6 is the so called return interval . for gaussian",
    "uncorrelated ( or weak correlated ) random variables the distribution of @xmath7 is well known to follows an exponential distribution @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the average value of @xmath7 when considering the threshold value @xmath4 .",
    "additionally , empirical results have shown that , in the presence of power law correlations in the data , the distribution is well adjusted by a stretched exponential  @xcite or by a weilbull distribution  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are constants and @xmath13 is the exponent of the power law autocorrelation function .",
    "these distributions also emerge in the analytical framework of santhanam and kantz  @xcite when considering a long - range correlated noise with gaussian pdf .",
    "notice that all these distributions are dependent on @xmath4 , but if we employ the scaled variable @xmath14 this dependence is eliminated .     for three realizations of the experiment ( squares , circles and triangles ) confronted with the standard gaussian pdf ( dashed line ) and with the garch model ( continuous line ) .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    before we investigate the return intervals , let us address the correlation question by using the detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa )  @xcite .",
    "this technique basically considers the root mean square fluctuation function @xmath31 ( see for instance  @xcite ) for the integrated and detrended time series for different values of the time scale @xmath19 . when the data present scale - invariance properties , @xmath31 follows a power law @xmath32 , where @xmath33 indicates the degree of correlation in the time series : if @xmath34 the series is uncorrelated and if @xmath35 the series is long - range correlated .",
    "figure [ fig : data](b ) shows the fluctuation function versus @xmath19 for the same three recordings of figure [ fig : data](a ) where we found @xmath36 indicating that long - range correlations are present in the data .",
    "note that the three curves are practically identical .",
    "this fact is evidenced by evaluating the mean value of @xmath33 ( @xmath37 ) and its standard deviation ( @xmath38 ) over the 16 recordings finding @xmath39 and @xmath40 . when considering the web recordings this values remain close : @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "now , advancing with the return interval distribution , it is interesting to emphasize that the exponents @xmath33 and @xmath13 are related via @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , since the distribution of @xmath14 should be normalized and also have unitary mean , the only fit parameter is @xmath13 that can be obtained from @xmath33 leading to @xmath44 .",
    "figure [ fig : data](c ) shows this distribution for three values of @xmath4 where we can observe a reasonable data collapse but a not so good agreement with the distributions of equation [ eq : stretched ] .",
    "similar situation have been recently observed when considering non - gaussian distributions related to water boiling  @xcite .",
    "we can also investigate the bursts observed in figure [ fig : exp](a ) by evaluating the volatility of the normalized sound amplitude .",
    "this time series refers to the local standard deviation of @xmath45 estimated over a time window @xmath46 , i.e. , @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath19 is a integer and @xmath49 is the sampling time interval .",
    "figure [ fig : data](d ) shows the volatility distribution of our empirical data for time windows ranging from @xmath50 to @xmath51 second .",
    "notice that we found a good collapse of data and that this distribution has an asymptotic power law decay characterized by a exponent @xmath52 .",
    "the mean value and the standard deviation of @xmath53 calculated over the 16 realizations are respectively @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the web recordings ) .",
    "our starting point to model the data behavior is the non - stationary aspect of the volatility .",
    "figure [ fig : data](d ) supports the conclusion that the volatility of the sound amplitude is a time - dependent stochastic process and figure [ fig : data](b ) indicates that long - term memory are present in sound intensity series .",
    "this feature is very common in financial data where the volatility ( or risk ) is one of most essential ingredients in the price dynamics . in this scenario ,",
    "much work has been done  @xcite and consequently a large amount of models are available . from a qualitative point of view",
    ", the interactions ( competitions ) among people present financial markets seems to be similar to the ones existent in our social system .",
    "this picture motives us to employ a typical financial model to our data .",
    "one of these models is the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic processes or simply the garch process .",
    "this model was proposed  @xcite ( at least in part ) to take into account the long memory typically found in financial data .",
    "it is defined in its most general form , garch@xmath58 , by @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are positive control parameters and @xmath62 is a uncorrelated random variable with zero mean and unitary variance .",
    "thus , the garch process is uncorrelated in @xmath63 but correlated in the variance .",
    "also note that for @xmath64 the garch recovery the so called arch process  @xcite .    here , for simplicity and also for satisfactoriness we will focus on the garch@xmath65 process @xmath66 for which we choose the distribution of @xmath62 to follow the standard gaussian .",
    "after this simplification the model have three parameters : @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 . however , since the sound amplitude is scaled to a unitary variance , we can eliminate one of these parameters by using the expected variance of the garch@xmath65 process @xmath63 : @xmath70 in this manner , we have now two parameters that we incrementally update to minimize , via the method of least squares , the difference between the simulated values of sound amplitude and the observational ones .",
    "the best values for the parameters are @xmath71 and @xmath72 leading to @xmath73 since @xmath74 .",
    "the comparison with the empirical data is shown in figure [ fig : data ] , where the garch@xmath65 predictions are indicated by the continuous lines .",
    "we can see that the agreement between the data and the garch@xmath65 is very good .",
    "concerning figure[fig : data](b ) , where we compare the dfa analysis , we have to remark that the autocorrelation function of the variable @xmath75 is not really long - range correlated .",
    "in fact , it has an exponential decay  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 .",
    "however , the garch@xmath65 process can mimic the long - range decay for large values of the characteristic time @xmath78 .",
    "this feature can be achieved by choosing the sum @xmath79 closer the unity . in our case , @xmath80 leading to characteristic time @xmath81 seconds , which is very large mimicking at least in part the long - range correlations .",
    "notice that the empirical data also present deviations from the straight line suggesting that correlations present in the data may have a kind of exponential cutoff .",
    "in this work we investigated some statistical aspects of the collective sound emitted by people when they are agglomerated in a meeting place . empirical evidences showed that ( i ) the normalized sound amplitude is not gaussian distributed , ( ii ) the sound intensity presents long - range correlations , ( iii ) the return interval distribution of the sound intensity is not exponential , and ( iv ) the volatility of the sound amplitude is non - stationary having a power law tail in its distribution .",
    "motivated by the time dependence of the volatility , we compared the observational quantities with the predictions of the garch@xmath65 model , finding a good agreement with all of them .     before concluding , we would like to point out some possible mechanisms responsible by the presence of heavy tail distributions and long - term correlations in the data .",
    "the first one is related to the fact that humans already have an intrinsic complex behavior which may manifest in our measurements .",
    "second , these individuals form small interacting groups adding more complexity to the system . on a third level",
    ", there is also an emergence of interactions between groups .",
    "naturally , more detailed measurements and models should be considered , in comparison with those one presented here , to obtain a broad understanding of this system .",
