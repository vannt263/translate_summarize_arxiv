    "the kagom lattice ( fig . [ cef ] ) with nearest neighbour antiferromagnetic exchange interactions exhibits peculiar magnetic properties , due to geometrical frustration @xcite . for classical spins",
    "it remains disordered within mean field approximation , reflecting the macroscopic degeneracy of the ground state .",
    "thermal or quantum fluctuations may leave partially this degeneracy , leading to ` order by disorder ' . here",
    "we show that dzyaloshinski - moriya interactions ( dmi ) are present in this system due to the low local symmetry ; we discuss the effect of dmi in relation with the magnetic structure observed in fe - jarosite @xcite .",
    "the dmi between two spins * * s**@xmath3 and * * s**@xmath4 was first introduced phenomenologically , using symmetry considerations , by dzyaloshinski @xcite , and moriya showed that it arises from taking into account the spin - orbit coupling ( @xmath5 ) in the super - exchange interaction between localized magnetic electrons @xcite . including dmi , the hamiltonian is written as :    @xmath6    the allowed * d * vectors of the dmi are restricted by the symmetry of the cristal ( moriya s rules @xcite ) . in the kagom lattice , there is no inversion symmetry between 2 neighboring sites ( see figure [ cef ] ) and the symmetry of the simple kagom lattice allows for * d * perpendicular to the kagom plane .",
    "however , in real compounds such as jarosites ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the non - magnetic atoms ( which are not on the kagom lattice ) are also relevant , as they contribute to the cristal field and to the super - exchange interaction .",
    "consequently they may lower the symmetry and allow for other directions of * d*.    in any case , applying moriya s rules will only _ restrict _ the possible * d * , but is not a proof of their existence .",
    "this is the reason for the microscopic derivation of the dmi in section [ calcul_microscopique ] .",
    "we have derived the dmi starting from an ( arbitrary ) set of localized d electronic states with the cristal electric field shown in fig .",
    "[ cef]a with one electron per magnetic site .",
    "+ following moriya s formalism @xcite we find :    @xmath7    where u is the on - site coulomb repulsion , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the hopping integrals as defined in @xcite .    in the jarosites ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , each magnetic site is surrounded by an octahedron of oxygen atoms which gives rise to the cristal electric field .",
    "the z axis of these octahedra is tilted towards the centers of the triangles of the kagom structure by an angle @xmath10 . in order to describe these compounds ,",
    "we have derived the dmi as above but with the local axis on each magnetic site represented on fig .",
    "[ cef]b . in this case , the * * d**@xmath11 are in the plane perpendicular to the bond i - j .",
    "the expressions of @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 can be obtained as in ( [ vecteur_d ] ) ; they depend on @xmath10 but we do not give them here for simplicity . in the following , we call @xmath15 the angle between * * d**@xmath11 and the z axis .",
    "looking at the ground state within mean field theory , we observe in both cases ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) a long range ordered structure .",
    "it is a * * q**=*0 * structure ( the magnetic cell contains 3 sites ) . in the case of * d * perpendicular to the kagom plane ( @xmath18 or @xmath19 ) , all spins lie in the kagom plane , and only one degree of freedom remains , which corresponds to a ` global ' rotation of all spins in the plane . in this case",
    "the dmi not only acts as an effective easy - plane anisotropy , it also selects one chirality for all the triangles , depending on the sign of d@xmath20 .    in the case of * d * not perpendicular to the kagom plane ( @xmath21 ) , the effect of the in - plane component of * d * is the following : the spins are no longer coplanar , each spin is directed in one fixed direction whose projection on the kagom plane is towards the centers of the triangles ( the chirality on the right of fig .",
    "[ phase_diag ] is selected ) and all the spins have the _ same _ out of plane component giving rise to a weak ferromagnetic magnetization perpendicular to the kagom plane .",
    "this magnetization increases with the in - plane component of * d * and decreases when @xmath22 increases as it should because isotropic exchange ( j ) selects coplanar magnetic structures .",
    "if d@xmath23 , it selects the same chirality as the in - plane component of * d * , and its effect is to reduce the out of plane magnetization .",
    "d@xmath24 tends to select the other chirality ( on the left of fig .",
    "[ phase_diag ] ) , resulting in a competition with the in - plane component of * d * , and there is a critical value of the angle @xmath15 between * d * and the z axis , above which the structure becomes coplanar .",
    "in fact such a non - coplanar magnetic structure has been observed in fe - jarosite ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) and could be due to dmi . in this jarosite",
    "it is also observed that the structure becomes coplanar at lower temperature which could be due to a small structural change , or possibly due to interplane interactions which are not taken into account in this work .    in order to study the effect of temperature on this magnetic structure , we have performed mont - carlo simulations with classical heisenberg spins for different vectors * d*. in all cases",
    "we observe a phase transition .",
    "the critical temperature has been obtained as a function of @xmath25 , which is represented on fig .",
    "[ phase_diag ] for the case d perpendicular to the plane .",
    "it is seen that the critical temperature is of the order of d.    thermal fluctuations also lift the degeneracy of the system without dmi @xcite@xcite , but there is no caracteristic energy scale , i.e , this selection occurs asymptotically when @xmath26 . on the other hand ,",
    "the phase transition due to dmi occurs at a temperature of the order of d. therefore , we expect that dmi when present will always dominate the low temperature behaviour .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that a dmi is relevant for the kagom lattice and found that it can induce a phase transition at a temperature of the order of d. it could explain some magnetic structures observed in the fe - jarosites @xcite ."
