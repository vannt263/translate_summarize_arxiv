    "the @xmath0 expansion of qcd  @xcite , where @xmath1 is the number of color charges , has emerged as one of the principal tools for studying low - energy hadronic processes and hadron static observables . in the simplest construction , baryons",
    "are assembled from a collection of @xmath1 quarks , each one transforming under the su@xmath2 fundamental representation , such that the aggregate forms a color singlet  @xcite .",
    "while analyzing baryons using the @xmath1 quarks spin - flavor and combinatoric properties has led to a large variety of interesting results far too numerous to review here  @xcite , the most compelling physical picture for describing the dynamical properties of large @xmath1 baryons ( particularly scattering amplitudes ) is the chiral soliton approach  @xcite originally motivated by the skyrme model  @xcite .",
    "one of the most intriguing properties of these studies is the emergence of model - independent linear relations among meson - baryon scattering amplitudes  @xcite , whose origin gradually became understood as connected to the large @xmath1 limit  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the existence of such relations can be traced back to the contracted su(4 ) spin - flavor symmetry that emerges in the single - baryon sector as @xmath3 , which in turn is obtained by demanding consistent order - by - order unitarity in meson - baryon scattering processes  @xcite ; the fact that the former can be derived from the latter was first demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the large @xmath1 scattering method  @xcite explains the existence of baryon resonance multiplets that share similarities ( but are not identical to ) those appearing in large @xmath1 quark models ; in particular , one can study resonances with arbitrarily large widths  @xcite , exotics  @xcite , and three - flavor resonances  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the means by which the spurious @xmath4 states may be removed  @xcite has been explored , as well as the nature of the competing chiral and large @xmath1 limits  @xcite , and results for multipion processes  @xcite .    an essential ingredient to obtaining results useful for @xmath5 phenomenology is understanding how to include @xmath0 corrections .",
    "the original large @xmath1 scattering amplitude relations were noted long ago to satisfy the @xmath6-channel isospin - spin exchange constraint @xmath7  @xcite . using operator techniques , ref .",
    "@xcite showed that static pion - baryon couplings with @xmath8 are suppressed by a relative factor of @xmath9 , and the same techniques were used to show  @xcite that nucleon - nucleon interactions with @xmath10 are suppressed by @xmath11 . much more recently ,",
    "the same techniques were used to show  @xcite the analogous result for @xmath6-channel pion - baryon scattering amplitudes .",

    "even so , the analysis of electroproduction amplitudes in the @xmath0 expansion is almost identical to that for the case of photoproduction . in this paper",
    "we derive expressions for pion electroproduction amplitudes at leading order ( lo ) and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the @xmath0 expansion and examine our findings using results of the maid  2007 partial wave analysis from universitt mainz  @xcite .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to present only the results of a strict @xmath0 analysis .",
    "while the @xmath0 expansion relates combinations of distinct amplitudes and predicts the magnitude of these differences at each value of @xmath17 and @xmath18an infinite number of testable predictions  it does _ not _ predict the shapes of their @xmath17 or @xmath18 dependences . obtaining such predictions",
    "would require imposing dynamical assumptions that lie beyond the raw mandates of the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "one may impose calculations using , for example , chiral perturbation theory , specific quark models , or generalized parton distributions on top of the amplitude predictions of this paper ( granted that they have been generalized to allow for @xmath1 to be arbitrary ) to obtain predictions for the detailed @xmath17 and @xmath18 amplitude shapes , but such modifications lie outside the intentionally limited scope of this paper .",

    "we remind the reader that the relations explored in figs .",
    "[ e - plot][s+plot ] and the lo comparisons of fig .",
    "[ m2plot ] are dominated by the isovector component of the photon .",

    "i.e. _ , real pion photoproduction .",
    "the projection of each e and m multipole on the @xmath133 axis gives amplitude curves obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and analyzed there in terms of the multipole relations eqs .",
    "( [ e1])([e2 ] ) and ( [ m1])([m3 ] ) restricted to @xmath157 .",
    "the most prominent features in the amplitudes are of course the baryon resonances , which are most apparent through large enhancements of the imaginary parts at values of c.m .",
    "energy @xmath18 equal to a resonance mass , but also noticeable from points where the real parts vanish .",
    "the falloff of each amplitude with increasing @xmath133 may be interpreted as the canonical behavior of an @xmath158 electromagnetic transition form factor , with the on - shell photon ( @xmath157 ) providing the least disruptive probe of the initial nucleon and hence the most efficient probe for producing a resonance .",
    "one finds , however , interesting exceptions to this reasoning ; in the imaginary part of the @xmath159 amplitudes ( fig .  [ s - plot ] ) , one sees that the @xmath160 produced in @xmath161 ( l.h.s . )",
    "peaks at @xmath162 , while that in @xmath163 ( r.h.s . )",
    "peaks at @xmath164  gev@xmath134 .    the resonant behavior accounts for the largest source of discrepancies of the @xmath0 relations .",
    "often one finds resonant behavior on both sides of a given relation , but with greatly differing residues at the peak ; this is the case for the @xmath165 peak in each @xmath166 amplitude of fig .",
    "[ e - plot ] or each @xmath167 amplitude of fig .",
    "[ s - plot ] .",
    "even the sign of the @xmath168 residue is different between the two @xmath169 amplitudes in fig .",
    "[ e+plot ] , while the @xmath168 appears to be absent altogether from the r.h.s.plot for @xmath170 in fig .",
    "[ s+plot ] although the amplitudes otherwise appear very similar .",
    "these are interesting anomalies arising even in amplitudes for which the value of @xmath37 on both sides of the amplitude relation are the same , so that the same resonance ( or more accurately , different members of an isomultiplet ) appears on both sides . for fig .",
    "[ m1plot ] and the nlo relation of fig .",
    "[ m2plot ] , @xmath37 differs on the two sides of the equation , meaning that distinct resonances appear . in the @xmath171 amplitudes of fig .  [ m1plot ] , for example , the @xmath172 resonance appearing in the @xmath173 ( l.h.s .",
    ") amplitude is broad and shallow , while the @xmath174 forms a huge peak in the @xmath175 ( r.h.s . )",
    "amplitude , with just a hint of the @xmath172 s true large-@xmath1 partner  @xcite , the @xmath176 , perhaps just visible .",
    "in fact , the @xmath174 should be eliminated from a large @xmath1 analysis of baryon resonances , because it is actually a degenerate partner to the nucleon whose width vanishes as @xmath177 , unlike the true resonances whose widths remain finite in this limit  @xcite .",
    "it is only due to the numerical accident that the chiral limit ( @xmath178 ) is more closely achieved in our @xmath129 universe than is the @xmath179 limit  @xcite that the @xmath174 in our universe decays to @xmath180 .",
    "however , true resonant `` shifted degenerate '' pairs such as @xmath172 and @xmath176 are particularly interesting because their masses differ by an amount that is @xmath138 relative to their average  @xcite , about 100150  mev .",
    "another example of this effect appears in the @xmath181 amplitudes in fig .",
    "[ m1plot ] , with the @xmath160 [ and perhaps also the @xmath182 or @xmath183 appearing in the @xmath184 ( l.h.s . ) and @xmath185 with a much smaller residue appearing in the @xmath186 ( r.h.s . ) .",
    "in fact , precisely the pair of @xmath160 and @xmath185 are considered as degenerate resonances in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is shown that the on - resonance couplings for the different channels behave exactly as expected from the @xmath0 expansion for @xmath129 . another `` shifted degenerate '' pair in fig .",
    "[ m1plot ] appears to be @xmath165 in the @xmath187 ( l.h.s . )",
    "amplitude and @xmath188 in the @xmath189 ( r.h.s . ) amplitude ; the @xmath188 is not apparent in the plots of ref .",
    "@xcite , which employs the older maid  2003 analysis rather than the maid  2007 variant used here .    in the case of the nlo relations eq .  ( [ m3 ] ) considered in fig .",
    "[ m2plot ] , the lo terms are @xmath155 and the nlo terms are @xmath190 , so entirely new resonances can appear at nlo .",
    "a curious example occurs for @xmath115 ; the broad peak appearing for @xmath161 ( l.h.s . ) , probably due to the @xmath172 , is unmatched by a contribution in @xmath191 in the @xmath173 amplitudes , and moreover , the @xmath168 appears prominently in the @xmath175 nlo corrections .",
    "on the other hand , the nlo contributions sometimes indicate a shifted degenerate pair ; this effect occurs for the already - mentioned @xmath160 and @xmath185 pair occurring at @xmath192  @xcite .    in regions away from resonances and for amplitudes",
    "not exhibiting any obvious resonances , the agreement tends to be rather better .",
    "this is certainly true for the @xmath193 and 5 amplitudes , but also for larger values of @xmath133 and for values of @xmath18 close to threshold as well as values at least 50100  mev from resonant peaks . of the highest quality",
    "are the isovector - dominated relations in figs .",
    "[ e - plot][s+plot ] , for which the same value of @xmath37 appearing on either side of the equation means that resonances appearing on the two sides of the relation belong to an isomultiplet . on the other hand , the benefits of the nlo correction in fig .",
    "[ m2plot ] remain ambiguous ; for example , some improvement appears in the real part of the @xmath115 relation , but the quality degrades in some kinematic regions for @xmath192 , and scarcely any change due to the nlo terms is noticeable for @xmath194 .",
    "the @xmath0 expansion , which has provided so much qualitative and semiquantitative guidance to understanding baryons in general , and the baryon resonance spectrum in particular , appears in the case of electroproduction to produce more ambiguous results .",
    "on one hand , it gives a natural explanation for the dominance of isovector over isoscalar amplitudes , and it provides a definite set of linear relations between multipole amplitudes that are expected to hold at all values of c.m .",
    "energy @xmath18 and photon virtuality @xmath133 . for values of @xmath18",
    "not near resonance masses as well as for larger values of @xmath133 , the agreement tends to be in accordance with the expectations of the @xmath0 expansion . even in the resonant region",
    ", one often sees evidence of the `` shifted degenerate '' resonances carrying different quantum numbers [ such as @xmath160 and @xmath185 ] that have related couplings .",
    "however , just as many cases exist in which the amplitudes in the resonant region do not entirely conform to naive @xmath0 expectations , both at leading and subleading order .",
    "the specific reason that a given large @xmath1 relation for pion electroproduction works surprisingly well or surprisingly poorly in the resonant region remains a challenge for future research .",
