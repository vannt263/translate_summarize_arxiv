    "since the anomaly of the specific heat at the glass transition was discovered in 1923@xcite , many studies have been conducted to understand the behavior .",
    "since the anomaly depends on the measurement process , the transition is now believed not to be understood in the framework of the standard thermodynamics@xcite .",
    "recently the concept of the landscape has been paid much attention because of possibility to explain the transition in non - equilibrium systems @xcite . in particular , the free energy landscape ( fel ) picture proposed by odagaki et al @xcite is considered to provide the unified concept for understanding thermodynamic and dynamic singularities of the glass transition .",
    "in fact , the single particle dynamics @xcite and the specific heat@xcite were shown to phenomenologically be well described by the framework based on the fel .",
    "namely , the dynamical transition is understood as the gaussian - to - non - gaussian transition@xcite , and the thermodynamic singularities near @xmath0 , including the cooling rate dependence of the specific heat , is characterized as the quenched - to - annealed transition in dynamics on the fel @xcite .",
    "the specific heat of non - equilibrium systems such as glass forming materials is defined by the reponse of the energy to the unit rise of temperature@xcite . because of the slow relaxations , the system can not reach equilibrium during the measurement and the energy response shows the time delay .",
    "therefore one can expect that the ac specific heat @xcite will contain informations of the slow dynamics .",
    "the ac specific heat @xmath3 is defined as the laplace - fourier transform of the energy or enthalpy correlation function @xmath4 @xcite @xmath5 the ac specific heat is often fitted by the laplace - fourier transform of the stretched exponential @xmath6 , since the correlation function is believed to be the superposition of the debye relaxation function with different relaxation times . however the origin of the distribution of the relaxation times has not clearly been understood .",
    "so far , studies of the energy response of glass forming systems have been limited within the linear response region , and the nonlinear energy response has not been studied yet . in a previous paper@xcite , we proposed the description of the 1st- and 2nd - order energy response with the free energy landscape picture and applied it to a two level system with a diverging barrier .",
    "it is shown that the 2nd - order energy response has a diverging term at the temperature where the relaxation time diverges .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the linear and nonlinear energy responses of non - equilibrium systems described by the fel picture to an oscillating temperature and present the characteristic behavior of the 1st- and 2nd - order ac specific heat . using a model fel which supports a glass transition ,",
    "we show that the vogel - fulcher temperature and the cross - over temperature as well as the glass transition temperature can be determined from the characteristic behavior of the ac specific heats .",
    "we also show that the statistics of the transition rate matrix representing the stochastic dynamics among the basins of the fel can be obtained from the frequency dependence of the 1st - order ac specific heat .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in  2 , we explain the 1st- and 2nd - order energy responses when the temperature of the heat bath is oscillated sinusoidally . the definition of the 1st- and 2nd - order ac specific heat is also given . in  3 , the stochastic dynamics on the free energy landscape is explained . in  4 , we describe the 1st- and 2nd - order energy responses to the oscillating temperature and the 1st- and 2nd - order ac specific heats when the system is described by the fel picture . as an example",
    ", a model system with fel consisting of 20 basins is analyzed . in  5 , where transition rates between basins are assumed to obey a power law distribution .",
    "we present the characteristics of the 1st- and 2nd - order ac specific heats of the glass former and show that the glass transition temperature , the vogel - fulcher temperature and the crossover temperature can be determined by the ac specific heats . in  6 , our conclusion is given .",
    "the specific heat at the constant volume @xmath7 is conventionally defined by a derivative of the energy with respect to the temperature , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the energy in the equilibrium state , @xmath10 is the temperature and @xmath11 is the volume . in this discussion of the specific heat",
    ", it is not considered how long the system takes to equilibrate itself when the temperature is changed .",
    "when the system contains degrees of freedom of slow dynamics , one must consider the effect of the delay in response .",

    "<S> a theory for the nonlinear energy response of a system subjected to a heat bath is developed when the temperature of the heat bath is modulated sinusoidally . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is applied to a model glass forming system , where the landscape is assumed to have 20 basins and transition rates between basins obey a power law distribution . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the statistics of eigenvalues of the transition rate matrix , the glass transition temperature @xmath0 , the vogel - fulcher temperature @xmath1 and the crossover temperature @xmath2 can be determined from the 1st- and 2nd - order ac specific heats , which are defined as coefficients of the 1st- and 2nd - order energy responses . </S>",
    "<S> the imaginary part of the 1st - order ac specific heat has a broad peak corresponding to the distribution of the eigenvalues . </S>",
    "<S> when the temperature is decreased below @xmath0 , the frequency of the peak decreases and the width increases . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the statistics of eigenvalues can be obtained from the frequency dependence of the 1st - order ac specific heat . </S>",
    "<S> the 2nd - order ac specific heat shows extrema as a function of the frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the extrema diverge at the vogel - fulcher temperature @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of the extrema changes significantly near @xmath0 and some extrema vanish near @xmath2 . </S>"
