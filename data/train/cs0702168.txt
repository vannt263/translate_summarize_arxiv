    "shape memory alloys ( sma ) are materials with increasing range of applications in engineering , aerosapce , and biomedical industries . they possess unique properties of being able to recover their original shape after permanent deformations .",
    "these materials can directly transduce thermal energy into mechanical and vice versa .",
    "the key to  pseudo - elastic \" behaviour of these materials and the  shape memory effect \" @xcite is held by the first - order martensitic phase transformations in these materials .",
    "indeed , drastic changes in their properties are originated from their microstructure or phase combinations . via the phase transformation",
    ", the microstructure of the material can be switched among various combinations between austenite , martensite variants , or their mixtures .",
    "austenitic phase is a more symmetric phase of the crystallic lattice , prevailing at high temperature , while martensite is a less symmetric , low - temperature phase @xcite . between these two critical situations , austenite and martensite",
    "might co - exist providing a typical example of phase combinations . upon external loading",
    ", one phase combination can be switched to another .",
    "if the material is constrained at the boundary , a specific ( `` self - accommodating '' ) combination of different phases will be established such that the bulk energy in the constrained domain will be minimized @xcite .",
    "the mathematical framework for modeling phase combinations in shape memory materials is based on the solution of the variational problem with respect to a frame - indifferent non - convex free energy function @xmath0 ( @xcite and references therein ) : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the reference configuration associated with the considered material , @xmath3 is the deformation tensor , and @xmath4 is the temperature of the material .",
    "hence , by minimizing @xmath5 from ( [ eq1 - 1 ] ) , we minimize the bulk energy of the considered structure , as a functional of the deformation tensor , at temperature @xmath4 .",
    "this procedure , performed particularly often at the mesoscale @xcite , has several known difficulties .",
    "it is known that in the general case the variational problem given by eq.([eq1 - 1 ] ) may have infinitely many minimizers ( @xcite and references therein ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a more precise definition of the free energy that allow us to account for interfacial energy effects by introducing gradients of the order parameters is a highly non - trivial task ( @xcite and references therein ) connected with additional difficulties .",
    "the problem can also be regularized by assigning simplified , e.g. affine , boundary conditions .",
    "for example , for the simulation of simple laminated microstructure , the affine boundary conditions are constructed by assuming that the deformation gradient of the material on the domain boundary is a linear combination of its equilibrium deformation gradients : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a rotation matrix satisfying a twinning equation ( see @xcite ) and @xmath8 is the thickness of layers in the laminated microstructure . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the deformation gradients that minimize the local energy function ( for square to rectangular transformation ) when the deformation gradient @xmath11 takes any of the following following values : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a local minimum of the free energy function @xmath0 . in the general case , however , the above affine boundary conditions may not be appropriate .    in solving problem ( [ eq1 - 1 ] ) , we have to face also numerical challenges connected with several local minima , resulted from phase mixtures under low and moderate temperature regimes , and non - convexity of the problem ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "minimization procedures based on conventional local search methods with randomly chosen initial guesses @xcite may not lead to a satisfactory result in those cases where the solution space is discretized with a large number of node points .    in the present paper",
    ", we construct a mathematical model for the simulation of phase combinations in sma materials on the basis of the landau theory .",
    "we associate the phase combination with the global minimizer of the bulk energy of the sma structure with the prescribed mechanical boundary conditions .",
    "we develop a hybrid optimization strategy consisting of two main steps .",
    "firstly , we apply the genetic algorithm ( ga ) and its global exploration capacity to obtain an initial estimation of the global minimizer .",
    "then , we apply the quasi - newton method to refine such an estimation locally .",
    "finally , the developed procedure is demonstrated by several numerical examples simulating phase combinations in sma materials .",
    "for the modeling of phase combinations in smas structures , the first task is to characterize different phases , which is different from one material to another . here",
    "our mathematical model will be based on the square to rectangular transformations . in fig.[srpt ] ( a ) we give a schematic representation of this case where the square lattice is the austenite , while two rectangles are the martensite variants .",
    "the square to rectangular transformation could be regarded as a 2d analog of the cubic to tetragonal or tetragonal to orthorhombic transformations observed in general 3d cases in @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 alloys and some copper based smas ( @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "the analysis of this 2d transformation is a first step in understanding more complex cubic to tetragonal and tetragonal to orthorhombic transformations .",
    "most numerical studies of the dynamics of the phase transitions up to date have been concentrated on the analysis of the formation and growth of the microstructure ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "such studies have been focused on the mesoscale under either periodic or affine boundary conditions .    in what follows ,",
    "we base our consideration on the landau theory of phase transformation . according to this theory , the basis of any nonlinear continuum thermodynamical model for phase transformation is a non - convex _ free energy function _ @xcite .",
    "the local minima of the free energy function with respect to the strain tensor ( or deformation gradients ) correspond to the stable and mesostable state at a given temperature , while the microstructure in the domain of interest can be described by the minimizer of the bulk energy in the domain .",
    "one of the simplest realization of this idea in the context of smas is based on the helmholtz free energy @xmath17 ( @xciteand references therein ) : @xmath18 where @xmath19 models thermal field contributions , @xmath20 models shape memory contributions and @xmath21 models mechanical field contributions , @xmath22 ( @xmath23 is the displacement ) is the strain which is chosen as the only order parameter in the 1d case .",
    "the thermal field contributions @xmath24 can often be modelled as follows @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the specific heat constant .",
    "the numerical analysis of a system of conservation laws based on the above representation of the free energy function ( and a more general one ) has been recently reported in detail in @xcite .",
    "a conservative numerical scheme was constructed for the solution of the problem .",
    "it was noted that a standard energy inequality technique , applied to the convergence analysis of the scheme , can lead to quite restrictive assumptions . in @xcite",
    "it was shown how such assumptions can be removed .",
    "this work focuses on the practical development of an algorithm suitable for the simulation of phase combinations . in this context",
    "we note that a free elastic energy functional ( denoted further by @xmath27 ) , similar to the one discussed above , was established earlier to characterize the austenite at high temperature and the martensite variants at low temperature in sma patches , specifically for the square to rectangular transformation where the landau free energy function @xmath28 was modified @xcite .",
    "recall that for the square to rectangular transformation we have to deal only with two martensite variants and only one order parameter @xcite in order to characterize the martensite variants and austenite in a 2d domain .",
    "following previous works on the subject ( @xcite and references there in ) , we have : @xmath29 \\displaystyle   f_s   = \\frac{a_1}{2}e_1 ^ 2+\\frac{a_3}{2}e_3 ^ 2 +   f_l        \\\\[10pt ] \\displaystyle    f_l   = \\frac{a_2}{2}e_{2}^2 - \\frac{a_4}{4}e_{2}^4+\\frac{a_6}{6}e_{2}^6 ,         \\\\[10pt ] \\displaystyle   f_g = \\frac{d_2}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{3 } ( \\nabla e_{i})^2 +    \\frac{d_3}{4}\\sum_{i=1}^{3 } ( \\nabla^2 e_{i})^2 .",

    "it is known that in this formulation the deviatoric strain @xmath44 can be chosen as the order parameter .",
    "more precisely , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are two - component order parameter strains that have been discussed before in @xcite .    in the above formulation",
    "the ginzburg term @xmath46 is the term proportional to square of strain gradients .",
    "this term is often included to account for the presence of domain walls .",
    "it is essential in simulating phase growth and several other phenomena ( @xciteand references there in ) , but it can be ignored if we are interested only in the macroscopic phase combinations of the smas patch under mechanical loadings ( indeed , the simulation scale in this case is too coarse to capture mesoscale structures ) .",
    "furthermore , the energy contribution of this term is typically small compared to other terms .    in order to be able to model the entire range of different phase combinations that correspond to different temperatures ,",
    "the material parameter @xmath31 is assumed to be temperature dependent @xmath47 , where _ _ @xmath4__@xmath48 is a critical temperature , responsible for the appearance of an addtional minimum and corresponding to the austenitic phase when temperature increases . in fig.[srpt ] ( b ) we present the plots of the landau free energy function , defined in this way , for the entire range of temperatures of interest ( the material @xmath49 ) .",
    "we observe that the function has two local minima at low temperatures ( @xmath50 ) , which correspond to two ( rectangular in the interpretation of fig.[srpt ] ( a ) ) martensite variants , while only one minimum at the center corresponds to the ( square ) austenite phase when the temperature is high ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "when the temperature is in between two critical values ( e.g. , at around @xmath52 in the figure ) , we observe that there are three local minima demonstrating co - existence of metastable and stable phases .    now",
    ", if we take the thermal contribution @xmath24 the same as in the 1d case , the final form of the helmholtz free energy function for the square to rectangular transformation will take the following form : @xmath53    by substituting the free energy function into the variational problem given by eq.([eq1 - 1 ] ) , the phase combination problem can be written as the following variational problem . given temperature @xmath4 , find the displacements @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( in the @xmath56 and @xmath57 direction ) that minimize the bulk energy : @xmath58    under a given temperature , the contribution of the thermal field will not change the profile of the local free energy function , but rather only shift it upwards or downwards . hence ,",
    "if the applied external force in 2d is given by its components @xmath59 , the final problem to solve can be formulated as follows : @xmath60    the above model is reduced to the well - known falk model in the 1d case @xcite that can be written with respect the only order parameter @xmath61 : @xmath62    as discussed in section 1 , we supplement the model ( [ eq2 - 8 ] ) by appropriate boundary conditions . for all examples discussed in section 4 ,",
    "these are clamped boundary conditions : @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the left and right boundaries along the @xmath56 direction , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the top and bottom boundaries along the @xmath57 direction , as sketched in fig.[sma2d ] .",
    "external forces vary and are specified in section 4 .",
    "the above variational problem is non - convex and its solution can only be obtained by numerical methods .",
    "the procedure developed in this section consists of two main steps : firstly , the variational problem is converted into a nonlinear minimization problem by spatial discretization , and then the solution of the resulting problem is sought by a hybrid optimization strategy .      for the spatial discretization , we employ the chebyshev pseudospectral approximation ( e.g. , @xcite ) on a set of 2d chebyshev points @xmath68 in the 2d domain of interest @xmath69 \\times [ -1,1]$ ] : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the total number of nodes in one direction .",
    "other structures of interest can be mapped onto the domain @xmath2 by a linear transformation . using the constructed grid ,",
    "the displacements in the patch can be approximated as follows : @xmath72 where @xmath73 represents either function @xmath54 or @xmath55 , @xmath74 is the function value at @xmath75 .",
    "functions @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the @xmath42 and @xmath78 lagrange interpolating polynomials along the @xmath56 and @xmath57 directions respectively .    having obtained ( [ 3eq2 ] ) , the derivatives of function @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , can be obtained by calculating @xmath82 and @xmath83 . following the standard technique found , e.g. , in @xcite , all the differentiation operators in eq.([eq2 - 8 ] ) ( or eq.[eq2 - 9 ] ) can be written in the matrix forms : @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are vectors collecting all values of the derivative @xmath87 and the function @xmath79 at @xmath88 , respectively , and similarly for @xmath89 .",
    "the differentiation matrices @xmath90 and @xmath91 can be calculated using the approximation given by eq.([eq3 - 2 ] ) .",
    "for instance , the differentiation matrix @xmath90 for the falk model takes the following form : @xmath92 \\displaystyle    -\\frac{2n^2 + 1}{6 } &   i = j = n ,         \\\\[10pt ] \\displaystyle    -\\frac{x_j}{2(1-x_j^2 ) } &   i = j=1,2,\\dots , n-1 ,         \\\\[10pt ] \\displaystyle     \\frac{c_i}{c_j } \\frac{(-1)^{i+j}}{(x_i - x_j ) } &        i \\neq j,\\quad i , j=1,2,\\dots , n-1 ,    \\end{array }    \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath93 for @xmath94 and @xmath95 otherwise .",
    "such matrices have dimensionality @xmath96 .",
    "the bulk energy is given by an integral operator with the local free energy function as its integrand .",
    "we use the same set of points as chosen for the derivative approximation for constructing a numerical integration formula for integral .",
    "in particular , we use chebyshev collocation nodes and the resulting quadrature formula is constructed by using the chebyshev - lobatto rule @xcite .",
    "for example , the formula for integration in the x - direction , generically represented by @xmath97 is exact for any polynomials with an order less than @xmath98 . in ( [ 3eq19 ] )",
    "weight coefficients @xmath99 are defined in the standard manner @xcite .    by substituting the approximations of all the differentiation operators and integral operators into the variational problem ,",
    "we convert the original problem into the following minimization problem : @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 stand for the values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 at node @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath103 is just the discretized bulk energy and is a nonlinear algebraic function of @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the resulting problem has @xmath104 variables in total . given the prescribed boundary conditions , we have @xmath105 variables in total .",
    "the problem to be solved is non - convex minimization problem with strong nonlinearity . it is not easily amenable to conventional gradient - based minimization methodologies due to multiple local minima . on the other hand",
    ", the genetic algorithms ( ga ) can be helpful in locating an approximation to the global minimum , giving an initial approximation to gradient - based procedures . in what follows ,",
    "we combine these two ideas by employing a hybrid optimization strategy that takes advantage of the global exploring capability of the ga and the local refinement accuracy of the quasi - newton method for non - convex problems .",
    "the ga is a well established methodology for global optimization ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we highlight here only its main features in the context of our problem .",
    "the ga maintains a population of individuals ( chromosomes ) , say @xmath106 , for generation @xmath107 and each chromosome consists of a set of genes , where each gene stands for a parameter to be estimated .",
    "one chromosome represents one potential solution to the minimization problem .",
    "each chromosome is evaluated to give some measure of its fitness according to the bulk energy defined in the previous section .",
    "some chromosomes undergo stochastic transformations by means of genetic operations to form new chromosomes .",
    "recall that there are two transformations in the ga : _ crossover _ , which creates new chromosome by combining parts from two chromosomes , and _ mutation _",
    ", which creates a new chromosome by making changes in a single chromosome .",
    "new chromosomes , called offsprings @xmath108 , are then evaluated .",
    "a new population is formed by selecting fitter chromosomes from the parent population and the offspring population .",
    "after some generations , the algorithm converges to the fittest chromosome , which represents an estimated optimal solution to the problem @xcite .",
    "_ generation of initial chromosomes _ : in most of the gas , the chromosomes are created by randomly choosing the genes in a given range . for the current problem",
    ", this is not an effective way . indeed ,",
    "if the strain in solid structures under consideration is assumed to be not very large , while displacements may vary slowly and be represented by smooth functions , there is no good reason to include high frequency oscillations in displacements . at the same time , if the displacement values are randomly chosen on our discrete grid , high frequency oscillations may well be pronounced .",
    "hence , we smooth the randomly chosen chromosomes by the following filter operation : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the vector collecting randomly chosen displacement values at all discretization nodes , while @xmath111 is the resultant smoother profile of the displacements after the filter operation . the matrix @xmath112 is an interpolation matrix which maps the given data at the discretization nodes onto a sparser grid , using the least square approximation , while the matrix @xmath113 is another interpolation matrix which maps the data on the sparse grid back to the given discretization nodes .",
    "these two matrices can be constructed by using the chebyshev collocation method , as discussed above .",
    "the product of these two interpolation matrices could be regarded as a filter to remove high frequency components .",
    "_ crossover _ : crossover operator in the ga is for producing new children chromosomes from chosen parent chromosomes . for a given pair of parent chromosomes @xmath114 and @xmath115 ,",
    "the offspring is obtained by the so called intermediate recombination @xcite : @xmath116 where @xmath117 is a vector with the same size as @xmath118 , and all its entries are randomly chosen independently .",
    "this operation is capable of producing variables slightly larger than the hypercube in the solution space defined by the parents , but confined by the parameter @xmath117 .",
    "a typical range for the parameters in @xmath117 is @xmath119 $ ] , which is used in the current paper .",
    "_ mutation _ : the mutation operation is randomly applied with a low probability , typically in the range @xmath120 to @xmath121 , and modifies genes in the chosen chromosome . its role in",
    "the ga is to make sure that the probability of searching any potential solution ( any points in the solution space ) is nonzero , and is often regarded as a measure to recover good genetic material that might be lost through the operation of selection and crossover @xcite .    in practice ,",
    "the mutation operation is carried out by replacing a randomly chosen gene by a randomly chosen new value in the given range .",
    "the mutated chromosome itself is randomly chosen from the current population with a given probability . in the current problem ,",
    "the mutation operation is applied to one chromosome in one generation , which means the probability for each chromosome is one divided by the number of chromosomes .    _",
    "generation - alteration method _ : generation alteration method determines how to evolve the current generation to the next , which means how to select pairs of parents for producing children by crossover and mutation operator , and how to select parents in the currents population that survive in the next generation .    taking into account their fitness , it is obvious that each chromosome should have a probability determined by the associated function value . here",
    "a simple linear map method is used as follows : rank all the chromosomes in the current generation in order of decreasing function values , then the probability of being chosen for a specific chromosome @xmath122 is calculated as : @xmath123 where @xmath122 is the position of the chromosome in the rank , while @xmath124 is the number of chromosomes in the rank .",
    "then the parents for survival and crossover are chosen using the above calculated probability .",
    "while all the chromosomes have nonzero probability to be chosen , fitter chromosomes have a better chance .",
    "the results of application of this procedure to the simulation of sma phase combinations are reported in the next section .",
    "the output of the ga is used as the initial guess for local search methods . in what follows",
    "we apply the quasi - newton method to the minimization of the bulk energy given in eq.[eq2 - 8 ] .",
    "let s denote any potential minimizer by @xmath118 .",
    "the bulk energy @xmath125 is minimized by @xmath126 if it satisfies @xmath127 . to achieve this",
    ", we can organize the following iterative process .",
    "let at the general @xmath128 step of the iteration , the potential solution is @xmath129 .",
    "then , the task is to estimate the next @xmath130 such that @xmath131 which means that @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the gradient of the bulk energy at @xmath129 , @xmath134 is the hessian matrix , while @xmath135 is the search direction . to make @xmath136",
    ", the search direction should satisfy : @xmath137 this standard newton - type procedure is computationally expensive and has other well - known drawbacks @xcite that preclude us from using it in the context of our problem .",
    "instead , we apply the quasi - newton procedure by constructing a matrix @xmath138 ( at the @xmath128 iteration ) , an approximation to the hessian matrix that satisfies the following condition : @xmath139    provided with the initial guess from the ga , the local search method using the quasi - newton method is organized in a standard manner : at the general @xmath128 iteration ( @xmath129 is the current estimated solution ) :    * find a descent direction @xmath140 using @xmath141 by the following formula : @xmath142 * compute the acceleration parameter @xmath143 by line search , find @xmath143 such that @xmath144 is minimized . * update the potential solution : @xmath145    finally , the update of the approximation of the hessian matrix @xmath146 is organized by using the bfgs update ( broyden - fletcher - goldfarb - shanno update , e.g. , @xcite ) :    @xmath147    where @xmath148 . to initiate the iteration process , @xmath149 for the first step",
    "is taken as the identity matrix that corresponds to the deepest descent methodology .",
