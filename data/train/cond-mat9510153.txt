    "we will study two limiting cases , the clean limit with complete absence of impurities and the dirty limit with high concentration of impurities such that the elastic scattering rate @xmath1 is large compared to the superconducting order parameter @xmath2 and the temperature @xmath3 .",
    "we introduce two different coherence lengths for both the superconducting and the normal side of the double - layer structure . in a superconducting material",

    "the fact that these bound states are extended over the whole thickness of the n - layer and that the density of andreev levels is spatially constant , leads to a constant current density .",
    "we can add , that in cylindrical geometries if the normal layer is not thin compared to the radius , this second condition is not satisfied . hence , as was pointed out by nazarov @xcite , the current density is not constant in space .",

    "the field expulsion is london like and the field as well as the current density fall off exponentially .",
    "the reason is that at this temperature the local penetration depth near the n - vacuum - boundary is practically constant . in the intermediate temperature regime",

    "the agreement is quite remarkable at low temperatures . at higher temperatures ( @xmath85 )",
    "the dirty limit theory can not be applied anymore and this explains the disagreement in this temperature regime .",
    "we will now turn to the nonlinear response . in fig .",
    "[ clean.nonlinear ] some numerical results for the clean case are shown .",
    "at the highest temperature shown here , the susceptibility drops to zero around @xmath86 . at lower temperatures the solution is not unique",
    "there is one solution with the maximal field expulsion , the value of which depends on temperature ( lower thick lines ) , and one solution , for which the field completely penetrates in the n - layer and there is no screening ( upper thick lines ) .",
    "the third solution with the negative derivative is unstable ( thin lines ) .",
    "the region in which the solution is non - unique grows , as the temperature is lowered , but the lower boundary of this region stays at the same value of the field . since only one solution can be stable , there must be a jump in the susceptibility at a certain point . in principle",
    "we could determine this point by comparing the free energies of the n - layer for the two different solutions .",
    "unfortunately the free - energy functional proposed by eilenberger @xcite can not be applied for @xmath87 ( normal region ) .    in experiments",
    "the situation is often quite different .",
    "on lowering or raising the field , the jump in the susceptibility would not occur at the value predicted theoretically , but effects like `` superheating '' or `` supercooling '' are likely to occur .",
    "these effects were observed in very clean samples @xcite .",
    "when the field is increased , the susceptibility will remain on the lower branch up to a certain field value and then will jump to the upper branch .",
    "on the other hand , when the field is decreased , the system will stay on the upper branch with complete field penetration . at a certain value of the field , the field",
    "will suddenly be expelled and the system will jump to the lower branch .",
    "these jump fields do not necessarily coincide with the boundaries of the instability zone .",
    "the boundaries of the hysteretic regions are shown in fig .",
    "[ clean.breakdown ] for different layer thicknesses .",
    "the superheating field depends exponentially on temperature , whereas the supercooling field depends not very strongly on temperature . at low temperatures",
    "the superheating field tends to saturate at a certain value , which is independent of the layer thickness .",
    "further calculations show that the saturation value is proportional to the material constant @xmath88 .    in the dirty limit",

    ". the saturation value at low fields and low temperatures can reach complete field expulsion for appropriately chosen values of @xmath90 . on the other hand",
    "the jump in the susceptibility is less than in the clean case . on increasing the field",
    "the susceptibility is reduced only by @xmath91 at the jump and reaches slowly zero , if the field is increased further . on lowering the field ,",
    "the jump is a slightly smaller .",
    "this hysteretic behavior was observed @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ dirty.breakdown ] the limits of the region with hysteretic behavior for different layer thicknesses in the dirty limit are shown .",
    "as in the clean case the superheating field depends exponentially on the temperature , but not as strongly . also , the supercooling field tends to become a constant at low temperatures and does not very strongly depend on temperature .",
    "in contrast to the clean case the saturation values of both fields at low temperatures depend strongly on the layer thickness .    finally , we would like to comment on some of our assumptions .",
    "we have assumed ideal interfaces between normal metal and superconductor , specular reflection at the interface between normal metal and vacuum , and spherical fermi surfaces in both materials . the formalism presented in this paper",
    "can be modified to describe more general physical situations . including e.g. non - ideal interfaces",
    "will weaken the proximity effect and diminish the diamagnetic response of the normal metal . in this paper , we have concentrated on presenting a model calculation in which the main aspects of the diamagnetic response of ns sandwiches can be studied . despite our simplifying assumptions ,",
