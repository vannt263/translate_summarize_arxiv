    "in the framework of the theory of open systems based on completely positive quantum dynamical semigroups , we study the dynamics of quantum entanglement and quantum discord of a subsystem consisting of two uncoupled modes interacting with a common thermal bath . the initial state of the subsystem is taken of gaussian form and the evolution under the dynamical semigroup assures the preservation in time of the gaussian form of the state . in sec .",

    "we investigate in sec .",
    "3 the dynamics of entanglement , by analyzing the time evolution of the logarithmic negativity , which characterizes the degree of entanglement of the state .",

    "we study the dynamics of a subsystem composed of two non - interacting modes in weak interaction with a thermal environment . in the axiomatic formalism based on completely positive quantum dynamical semigroups , the markovian irreversible time evolution of an open system",
    "is described by the lindblad - kossakowski master equation .",
    "we are interested in the set of gaussian states , therefore we introduce such quantum dynamical semigroups that preserve this set during time evolution of the system .    the two - mode gaussian state",
    "is entirely specified by its covariance matrix , which is a real , symmetric and positive matrix : @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are @xmath4 hermitian matrices . @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the symmetric covariance matrices for the individual reduced one - mode states , while the matrix @xmath3 contains the cross - correlations between modes .",
    "the equations of motion for the quantum correlations of the coordinates @xmath5 and momenta @xmath6 of the two modes are the following ( @xmath7 denotes the transposed matrix ) @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 @xmath10 is the mass , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the frequencies of the non - resonant modes , and diffusion coefficients @xmath13 ... and dissipation constant @xmath14 are real quantities .    the time - dependent solution of eq .

    "in order to quantify the degree of entanglement of the two - mode states it is suitable to use the logarithmic negativity . for a gaussian density operator ,",
    "the logarithmic negativity is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the smallest of the two symplectic eigenvalues of the partial transpose @xmath21 of the 2-mode covariance matrix @xmath22 . in our model , the logarithmic negativity is calculated as @xcite @xmath23\\ } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 ^ 2-\\det\\sigma(t)}\\right)^{1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we assume that the initial gaussian state is the two - mode squeezed thermal state , with the covariance matrix of the form @xcite @xmath25 with the matrix elements given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the average numbers of thermal photons associated with the two modes and @xmath28 denotes the squeezing parameter . in the particular case @xmath29 and @xmath30 , ( [ ini1 ] ) becomes the covariance matrix of the two - mode squeezed vacuum state .",
    "a two - mode squeezed thermal state is entangled when the squeezing parameter @xmath28 satisfies the inequality @xmath31 @xcite , where @xmath32    we suppose that the asymptotic state of the considered open system is a gibbs state corresponding to two independent modes in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath33 then the quantum diffusion coefficients have the following form ( we put @xmath34 ) @xcite : @xmath35    the calculations with separable initial squeezed thermal states show that these states remain separable for all values of the temperature @xmath36 and for all times .",
    "the evolution of entangled initial squeezed thermal states with the covariance matrix given by eq .",
    "( [ ini1 ] ) is illustrated in figure 1 , where we represent the dependence of the logarithmic negativity @xmath37 on time @xmath38 and temperature @xmath36 for the case of an initial symmetric gaussian state , when @xmath39 .",
    "we observe that for a non - zero temperature @xmath40 at certain finite moment of time , which depends on @xmath40 @xmath37 becomes zero and therefore the state becomes separable .",
    "this is the so - called phenomenon of entanglement sudden death .",
    "it is in contrast to the quantum decoherence , during which the loss of quantum coherence is usually gradual @xcite . for @xmath41 @xmath37",
    "remains strictly positive for finite times and tends asymptotically to 0 for @xmath42 therefore , only for zero temperature of the thermal bath the initial entangled state remains entangled for finite times and this state tends asymptotically to a separable one for infinitely large time .",
    "dissipation favorizes the phenomenon of entanglement sudden death  with increasing the dissipation parameter @xmath43 the entanglement suppression happens earlier .",
    "the same qualitative behaviour of the time evolution of entanglement was obtained previously @xcite in the particular case @xmath29 and @xmath30 corresponding to an initial two - mode squeezed vacuum state .",
    "quantum discord was introduced @xcite as a measure of all quantum correlations in a bipartite state , including  but not restricted to  entanglement .",
    "originally the quantum discord was defined and evaluated mainly for finite dimensional systems .",
    "very recently @xcite the notion of discord has been extended to the domain of continuous variable systems , in particular to the analysis of bipartite systems described by two - mode gaussian states .",
    "closed formulas have been derived for bipartite thermal squeezed states @xcite and for all two - mode gaussian states @xcite .",
    "the gaussian quantum discord of a general two - mode gaussian state can be defined as the quantum discord where the conditional entropy is restricted to generalized gaussian positive operator valued measurements ( povm ) on the mode 2 , and in terms of symplectic invariants it is given by ( the symmetry between the two modes 1 and 2 is broken ) @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the symplectic eigenvalues of the state , given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 notice that gaussian quantum discord only depends on @xmath51 , i.e. , entangled ( @xmath52 ) and separable states are treated on equal footing .    the evolution of the gaussian quantum discord @xmath53 is illustrated in figure 2 , where we represent the dependence of @xmath53 on time @xmath38 and temperature @xmath36 for an entangled initial symmetric gaussian state , taken of the form of a two - mode squeezed thermal state ( [ ini1 ] ) , for such values of the parameters which satisfy for all times the first condition in formula ( [ infdet ] ) . for entangled initial states the gaussian discord remains strictly positive in time and in the limit of infinite time it tends asymptotically to zero , corresponding to the thermal product ( separable ) state , with no correlations at all .",
    "the gaussian discord has nonzero values for all finite times and this fact certifies the existence of nonclassical correlations in two - mode gaussian states , either separable or entangled .    from figure 2",
    "we notice that , in concordance with the general properties of the gaussian quantum discord @xcite , the states can be either separable or entangled for @xmath54 and all the states above the threshold @xmath55 are entangled .",
    "we also notice that the decay of quantum discord is stronger when the temperature @xmath36 is increasing .",
    "in the framework of the theory of open systems we investigated the markovian dynamics of quantum correlations for a subsystem composed of two non - interacting modes embedded in a thermal bath .",
    "we have described the time evolution of the logarithmic negativity in terms of the covariance matrix for squeezed thermal states , for the case when the asymptotic state is a gibbs state corresponding to two independent quantum harmonic oscillators in thermal equilibrium .",
    "for all values of the temperature of the thermal reservoir , an initial separable gaussian state remains separable for all times . in the case of an entangled initial squeezed thermal state",
    ", entanglement sudden death takes place for non - zero temperatures of the environment . only for a zero temperature of the thermal bath the initial entangled state remains entangled for finite times , but in the limit of infinite time it evolves asymptotically to an equilibrium state which is always separable .",
    "the gaussian quantum discord decreases asymptotically in time .",
    "this is contrast with the sudden death of entanglement .",
    "the time evolution of quantum discord is very similar to that of the entanglement before the sudden suppression of the entanglement .",
    "after the sudden death of the entanglement , the nonzero values of quantum discord quantify the nonclassical correlations for separable mixed states .",
