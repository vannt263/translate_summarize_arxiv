    "spin - polarized transport represents a new branch of mesoscopic physics , in which both the charge and _ spin _ of the electron are actively manipulated.@xcite in different setups , the spin may be employed as information storage or transport element , where the advantage over charge transport stems from the very long spin lifetimes in many materials , and the smallness of the dissipated power .",
    "these advantages have already resulted in many technological applications , and among the most popular future perpectives of spintronics is the field of quantum computation.@xcite spin - dependent transport also offers novel insights into fundamental physics . in this paper",
    "we shall address in detail how spin transport proceeds in strongly interacting non - fermi liquid metals , taking the behavior of one - dimensional ( 1d ) metals as a paradigm in which electron - electron interactions lead to a breakdown of fermi liquid theory .",
    "the 1d non - fermi liquid behavior is often described by _",
    "luttinger liquid _  ( ll )",
    "theory.@xcite    the primary motivation for this study comes from recent transport experiments@xcite on carbon nanotubes,@xcite which have demonstrated the breakdown of fermi liquid theory in these nearly ideal 1d quantum wires ( qws ) .",
    "in fact , when studying charge transport in single - wall nanotubes ( swnts ) , the observed power - law behaviors in the tunneling density of states are consistent with their theoretical description@xcite in terms of a ll .",
    "the ll describes metals in the 1d limit where only one or very few bands intersect the fermi energy .",
    "this non - fermi liquid exhibits fractionalization of electrons into novel quasiparticles , comprising a diverse set carrying spin separately from charge , and charge in fractions of the electron charge @xmath0.@xcite furthermore , the ll is the simplest model showing the remarkable phenomenon of _ spin - charge separation _ which has been postulated by many to underly the cuprate superconductors.@xcite  in a ll , spin and charge degrees of freedom are completely decoupled , and moreover characterized by different velocities . as landau quasiparticles are unstable , an electron will spontaneously decay into charge and spin density wave packets which then propagate with different velocities .",
    "thereby a spatial separation of spin and charge of the electron results .",
    "unfortunately , this hallmark behavior of strongly correlated 1d fermions remains to be observed experimentally ( at least in an unambiguously accepted way ) .",
    "elaborating on our short paper,@xcite we propose several feasible setups that would allow to unambiguously detect spin - charge separation via spin transport experiments on an individual swnt . for related but rather different proposals to detect spin - charge separation in a ll via spin transport ,",
    "see also refs .   and .",
    "as will be described at length below , this can be achieved by attaching _ ferromagnetic",
    "_  leads to the qw , and possibly an additional magnetic field , see fig .",
    "for simplicity , identical contact parameters are assumed below , with straightforward generalization possible . by measuring the variations of the current - voltage @xmath1 characteristics with either the angle @xmath2 between the ferromagnetic magnetizations in the leads , or the magnetic field @xmath3 , one can indeed directly probe spin - charge separation .",
    "a related spin - transport experiment has been carried out recently for multi - wall nanotubes , where the angle @xmath2 was fixed to either zero or @xmath4.@xcite the experiment proposed here for swnts should either allow for arbitrary @xmath2 , or employ an additional magnetic field .",
    "we note that spin transport in such a setup is well understood for fermi liquids . in particular , the @xmath5 characteristics ( including a magnetic field ) have been computed recently using a semiclassical description.@xcite    in our theory , we assume that tunneling across the two contacts proceeds incoherently , i.e. , the length @xmath6 of the qw must be longer than either the thermal length scale @xmath7 or the scale @xmath8 set by the applied voltage @xmath9 .",
    "we then consider in general systems composed of 1d interacting quantum wires and bulk ferromagnets . with the exception of sec .",
    "[ sec : extensions ] , where the additional flavor degree of freedom present in swnts will be addressed , we focus on single - mode qws .",
    "another interesting aspect of spin transport concerns the role of electron - electron backscattering interactions . in a spin-@xmath10 qw , these interactions are ( marginally ) irrelevant under the renormalization group ( rg ) flow , and therefore only cause a renormalization of interaction parameters in the low - energy ll theory.@xcite however , this essentially thermodynamic ( equilibrium ) argument must be re - examined when dealing with spin transport .",

    "to study transport , we must formulate the non - equilibrium dynamics of the system .",
    "this formulation is more subtle than in conventional charge transport , due to the complications arising from the non - commuting nature of spin .",
    "we therefore proceed carefully along the lines of a keldysh approach . for concreteness ,",
    "we specialize for the moment to a semi - infinite ll contacted at @xmath23 .",
    "consider an initial system composed of two decoupled pieces , described by the hamiltonian @xmath80 .",
    "the ferromagnetic part , governed by @xmath81 , is polarized along direction @xmath46 , and located at @xmath42 .",
    "the wire , located at @xmath82 , is governed by @xmath83 , which is assumed @xmath84 invariant .",
    "the latter condition guarantees the existence of a continuity equation for the spin density and current .",
    "similarly , charge conservation implies a continuity equation for charge density and current . at @xmath85 , we assume that each half is at quasi - equilibrium at its own chemical potential , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "similarly , we assume that the ll supports a quasi - equilibrium magnetization , which can be described by a grand canonical distribution with a `` spin chemical potential '' @xmath88 .",
    "we stress that neither @xmath87 nor @xmath88 are physical potentials , such as electrostatic or zeeman fields , but rather characterize the initial non - equilibrium distribution .",
    "then we adiabatically turn on the contact perturbation @xmath89 , @xmath90 where @xmath91 is an infinitesimal inverse time - scale controlling the slow turning on of the contact interaction .",
    "the above formulation is rather rigorous , but has the limitation of being formulated to treat _ both _  the tunneling and boundary exchange terms as perturbations . in practice",
    ", this is appropriate in the low - conductance limit , since the boundary exchange is generally determined by virtual tunneling processes , and is hence small .",
    "however , it is useful theoretically to contemplate a situation in which the tunneling is small but the boundary exchange is not . in such a case , it appears natural to include @xmath92 into @xmath93 rather than in @xmath94 .",
    "this raises difficult conceptual issues , since @xmath92 does not commute with the total spin of the ll , and hence renders its magnetization uncertain in directions perpendicular to @xmath46 . on physical grounds , however , we expect that , because @xmath92 transfers spin into / out of the ll only at the boundary , sense can be made of the _ bulk _ spin chemical potential in the limit of a semi - infinite ll .",
    "this is fairly clear from the following thought experiment : imagine preparing the ll with zero tunneling and zero boundary exchange in a state with a non - zero magnetization density not parallel to @xmath46 .",
    "then , if @xmath92 is turned on at some time , its effect will be to scatter left - moving electrons into right - moving ones upon their reaching @xmath23 , changing their spin orientation in the process .",
    "if the ll is semi - infinite , however , it would take an infinite amount of time to modify the mean magnetization of the ll in this way .",
    "instead , one expects a steady - state to be established , generally with a time - independent spin current .",
    "moreover , for a finite but long ll , so long as there are some inelastic processes deep in the ll that can equilibrate the returning electrons , one expects that an equilibrium state will be established which has a mean magnetization very close to that before turning on the boundary exchange .",
    "in fact , a scattering approach of this type can be directly implemented using bosonization methods , and will be discussed analytically in sec .",
    "[ sec : bos ] .",
    "alternatively , @xmath92 can be incorporated directly into @xmath93 , but in this case , care must be taken to ensure that @xmath88 is coupled only to the magnetization outside a neighborhood of the boundary .",
    "for the moment , we simply use the above discussion as motivation to incorporate @xmath92 into @xmath93 .",

    "( [ pop ] ) .",
    "these terms arise since the presence of a contact inevitably leads to local disorder within the qw .    for a non - interacting qw ,",
    "all three contributions are on an equal footing , as they all involve fermion bilinears . when interactions are present in the qw , however , this is no longer the case .",
    "in fact , in the boundary rg framework , they scale completely differently . in particular , the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath56 is irrelevant , the boundary exchange @xmath92 is marginal , and the single - particle backscattering @xmath418 is relevant . thus provided all terms in @xmath412 are comparable , @xmath418 will dominate at low energies , where the distance to another contact , the inverse temperature , and any inverse voltage are all sufficiently large .",
    "the effect of such relevant backscattering terms has been studied extensively.@xcite we expect that the final result in the low energy limit is to completely sever the ll into two halves at @xmath410 . in that case",

    "while the general methodology and physical results applied above pertain to any interacting qw , some differences exist that should be taken into account in applying the formalism in detail to nanotubes .",
    "in particular , a `` pristine '' swnt has not one but two 1d bands crossing the fermi energy , arising from the sublattice reflection symmetry of the graphene lattice .",
    "thus in fact the low - energy description of swnts requires an additional `` flavor '' index @xmath431 on all electron fields , @xmath432 .",
    "moreover , the low - energy hamiltonian describing the nanotube in the absence of backscattering and magnetic fields respects the full chiral @xmath433 symmetry of arbitrary separate @xmath434 rotations of right- and left - movers in the combined spin - flavor space .",
    "this symmetry implies that , to a good approximation ( since backscattering terms are weak ) , not only the @xmath84 spin currents @xmath435 but the full @xmath436 _ spin - flavor currents _ , @xmath437 are conserved . in the ballistic limit , these currents satisfy chiral wave equations away from the contacts , @xmath438 and a full solution of the transport problem in the steady state requires imposing constant values of each of these ( @xmath439 ) chiral currents between contacts and/or ends of the nanotube . moreover , @xmath436 generalizations of the contact exchange @xmath92 can be expected .    as we have seen in the simpler single - channel case above , backscattering terms , even when weak , can lead to significant effects in long tubes .",
    "because the backscattering interactions do not respect the ( accidental ) @xmath436 symmetry but only the physical symmetries , there are in fact a variety of independent backscattering couplings .",

    "( [ precession2 ] ) .",

    "the remaining orthogonal linear combinations of the spin - flavor densities can themselves decay , with some `` flavor decay rate '' @xmath449 . for sufficiently long nanotubes and low energies , @xmath450",
    ", these flavor densities become negligible between contacts , and we expect to be able to simply ignore the flavor currents . given the smallness of the backscattering couplings in nanotubes , however , this may occur only at very low voltages and temperatures , and for very long tubes .",
    "a proper treatment of these effects at intermediate length scales is technically rather complicated , and beyond the scope of this paper . nevertheless , the extension is in principle straightforwardly based on the techniques developed here .",
    "it is amusing to note that the issue of flavor currents is actually a concern even when all the leads are ordinary paramagnetic metals , since even such contacts generically do not respect flavor .      up to this point",
    ", we have assumed that the qw in consideration is itself spin - rotationally invariant .",
    "in general , quantum mechanical spin - orbit coupling mixes spin and orbital angular momentum , leading to a small violation of spin conservation . this can occur both as a bulk and a boundary effect . for semiconductor qws ,",
    "the spin - orbit effects are well understood .",
    "for swnts , they are expected to be extremely small .",
    "indeed , in an ideal flat sheet of graphene , spin - orbit effects are negligible due to the high symmetry of the zone - boundary wavevector , the @xmath451 nature of the electronically active carbon orbitals , and the small atomic number of carbon . from a simple tight - binding treatment ( not shown here ) , we indeed find a vanishing effect for ideal graphene . in swnts ,",
    "bulk spin - orbit effects can then in principle solely occur due to the curvature of the nanotube , to phonon distortions , and to defects in the tube .",
    "the first two factors are probably negligible as they are suppressed both by the smallness of the relativistic nature of spin - orbit coupling and by the smallness of the nanotube curvature and the electron - phonon coupling , respectively .",
    "tube defects generally destroy the local symmetry of the lattice and allow some spin - orbit scattering .",
    "however , these same defects also elastically scatter ordinary momentum , so that one may estimate the spin - orbit scattering rate as @xmath452 , where @xmath453 reflects the relativistic nature of the microscopic spin - orbit coupling . since the elastic mean - free - path of swnts is known to be of the order of microns",
    ", the corresponding spin - orbit scattering length must be orders of magnitude larger , and hence also of no importance for current tubes which are at best a few tens of microns long .",
    "parenthetically , we note that in multi - wall nanotubes , disorder is more important , and hence spin - orbit scattering may be of more relevance . in any case , it is straightforward to include the effect of spin non - conservation theoretically by modifying eq .",
    "( [ sum1 ] ) to @xmath454 probably more significant is spin - flip scattering at the boundaries of the qw and contacts , which are often much more disordered than the bulk of the qw .",
    "such processes can be incorporated by a renormalization of the contact parameters @xmath455 and @xmath155 , see ref .  .",
    "a uniform magnetic field has already been included in eq .",

    "( [ sum1 ] ) and ( [ precession2 ] ) .",

    "are invariant , but the boundary terms become anomalous , @xmath474 where the pair field is @xmath475 and we used the boundary conditions to remove the factor of @xmath476 in the magnetic exchange .",
    "equation ( [ sns ] ) is the bogoliubov - degennes hamiltonian for an sns junction in the limit of large normal reflection .",
    "the latter limit is implied by the boundary conditions @xmath477 at the ends .",
    "the presence of the pair - field terms leads to andreev reflection at the boundaries .",
    "as is well - known , such an sns junction carries an _ equilibrium current_@xmath478 for any @xmath2 which is not a multiple of @xmath337 .",

    "some interesting variables in the spin problem are @xmath481 we see that @xmath482 and @xmath483 correspond to the charge current and density , respectively , in the transformed variables .",
    "thus the fm - ll - fm device indeed carries a non - vanishing @xmath484-axis spin current . note , however , that the in - plane magnetization corresponds to strange `` large - momentum '' pair fields in the analog sns system .    for comparison to the results of the previous sections , note that our hydrodynamic treatment gives zero spin current at zero applied voltage .",
    "this is not inconsistent , because eq .  ( [ apred ] ) , which is exact in equilibrium , predicts a spin current @xmath485 that vanishes in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "more precisely , the hydrodynamic results require incoherent transport , which holds e.g.  for @xmath486 .",
    "the hydrodynamic approach predicts @xmath487 , which can be crudely matched to the `` andreev '' prediction ( [ apred ] ) .",
    "in particular , the hydrodynamic and `` andreev '' currents are comparable when @xmath488 , that is essentially at the boundary between the coherent and incoherent regimes . one learns from the sns mapping that the spin current is actually enhanced by coherence .    in an sns junction ,",
    "one expects a proximity - effect induced pair field within the normal region . naively one might therefore expect some uniform bulk magnetization in the @xmath464 plane .",
    "this conclusion is , however , false , as can be seen by rewriting the superconducting pair field , @xmath489 the pair field thus maps back to the @xmath490 oscillatory component of the @xmath464 magnetization , @xmath491 , but not to the uniform one .",
    "let us finally summarize some of the open questions from our point of view , and provide an outlook .",
    "one rather obvious concern might be the _ incoherent _",
    "nature of transport assumed in our study . for sufficiently long quantum wires and/or low conductance of the contacts",
    ", it certainly is appropriate to assume a two - step sequential transport mechanism through the fm - ll - fm device . what happens if one has",
    "_ coherent _",
    "the latter situation could arise for higher - transparency contacts or at very low energies .",
    "however , from the analogy to sns junctions , we expect that our main conclusions are qualitatively unaffected by coherence , and we therefore do not expect a dramatic change . nevertheless , it would be interesting to study this question in detail . for non - interacting electrons , this could be done in the framework of a landauer - type approach , see also refs .   and .",
    "a related issue concerns the role of _ charging effects_@xcite where transport through the ll is hindered by coulomb blockade . for low - transparency contacts ,",
    "these effects are known to be crucial at energy scales below the charging energy @xmath492 , which can be estimated for a swnt of length @xmath6 , radius @xmath36 , and background dielectric constant @xmath493 , @xmath494 and typically is of the order of a few mev .",
    "charging effects are washed out by intermediate - to - high temperatures , and could in principle be avoided altogether by using higher - transparency contacts and/or long tubes .",
    "we note that charging effects also tend to destroy spin accumulation,@xcite and therefore one has to be careful that they are not present when experimentally testing for spin - charge separation .",
    "however , since they manifest themselves through quite pronounced dependencies on external gate voltages , this issue is not expected to create serious difficulties in practice . furthermore , although our present theory does not include charging effects , this could be accounted for easily via a proper treatment of the zero modes in the bosonized version of the luttinger liquid.@xcite",
    "a very interesting extension of the methods of this paper is to problems involving _ mesoscopic _ ferromagnetic contacts which are sufficiently small so that their magnetization becomes _",
    "dynamical_. here the quantum wire / nanotube would mediate an effective rkky - type interaction between the fm magnetizations , and novel transport phenomena can be anticipated .",
    "it would now clearly be of great interest to experimentally study the scenario put forward here .",
    "the probably best candidates for such experiments are single - wall carbon nanotubes , which should offer the unique possibility of observing spin - charge separation directly on a single 1d quantum wire .",
    "in addition , the effects of backscattering were shown to imply rather dramatic consequences for spin transport , such as a sawtooth - like oscillatory current - voltage relation .",
    "such spectacular consequences of the electron - electron interactions have not been predicted previously , but should be observable for long nanotubes at very low temperatures .",
