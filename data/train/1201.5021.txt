    "galaxies with very high infrared ( ir ) luminosities ( @xmath4@xmath5>10^{12}$]l@xmath6 ) known as ultra luminous ir galaxies ( ulirgs ) , dominate the ir background and the star formation rate ( sfr ) density at z@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "although uncommon at lower redshifts , the presence of ulirgs in the local universe offers the opportunity of investigating their parsec scale structure , while profiting from the high angular resolution provided by current instrumentation .",
    "studying ulirgs in the local universe is of great importance since it can aid to understand their high - redshift analogues which dominate the sub - mm sky ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is thought that ulirgs represent a key stage in the formation of optical quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) and powerful radio galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a study based on _ hst _ observations and _ n_-body simulations point to diverse evolutionary paths , not necessarily including a qso phase @xcite .",
    "there is however a general agreement on gas - rich galaxy merging as the origin of ulirgs @xcite , and on the ubiquity of enhanced star - formation , which can be found in combination with different flavours of active galactic nucleus ( agn ) activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . which of these two contributions dominates and is primarily responsible for the overall dust heating , is still an open question .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     from section [ sec : obs_str ] , we know that the radio emission at l- and c - bands has a different extent and peaks at different positions within the nuclear region , which strongly suggests the presence of different populations of particles .",
    "this is more evident in the nuclear region mapped with the evn : in the innermost region , where there is an overlap between the emission at the two different frequencies , there would be a concentration of very energetic , short - lived particles , whereas the outer region would be populated by less energetic , long - lived particles , which had had time to diffuse from the inner regions into the outer ones . in table",
    "[ tab : combovalues ] we show the values for @xmath7 , assuming that the critical frequency is either that of the l - band or the c - band . in all cases",
    "we see that the l - band emission is tracing the emission from an older population of electrons ( regardless of the resolution ) than the one emitting at c - band frequencies .",
    "the putative agn together with an ensemble of sne , for which evidence has been found in other studies ( see section [ sec : iras2336 ] ) , must be located within the c - band emission region as seen with the evn , where the magnetic field strength is larger , and where a composite spectrum ( which varies with time ) has been found ( section [ subsec : nucspec ] ) .",
    "we note that the radio lifetime of the emitting source is not only determined by @xmath7 .",
    "the lifetime of relativistic electrons might also be affected by compton losses given by @xmath8 ( following * ? ? ?",
    "* ) since the electrons are immersed in a radiation field , @xmath9 for which we take @xmath10 as a good approximation to the bolometric luminosity @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 varies from @xmath13erg@xmath14 at galactic scales , up to @xmath15erg@xmath14 at nuclear scales . to compare the different losses ,",
    "we calculate their ratio , @xmath16 we note that at all scales ( nuclear , circumncuclear and galactic ) and at both l- and c - band , we obtain @xmath17 , with a ratio ranging between @xmath18 ( nuclear scales ) and @xmath19 ( galactic scales ) ; i.e. , the energy density of the radiation field , greatly exceeds the magnetic energy density .",
    "radiative losses are important and we argue that there is need for injection of new electrons or a continuous acceleration to halt the energy depletion , otherwise radio emission would not be visible .",
    "the re - acceleration or injection of new electrons in a ( u)lirg environment , is very likely provided in sn - shells and snrs by first order fermi acceleration .",
    "the presence of sne , snrs and a strong magnetic field in iras23365 , agrees with this scenario .      among the evn observing epochs , the third one benefited from a better coverage , and thus resulted in a smaller natural beam ( 19@xmath2025mas@xmath21 at 30 at l - band ) .",
    "the l - band map ( figure [ fig : combo_resol ] , bottom - left ) shows the presence of two compact sources ( el1 and el2 ) within the nuclear region , without counterparts at c - band . on the other hand , the compact source that dominates the emission at c - band , labelled as ec1 ( figure [ fig : combo_resol ] , bottom - right ) , has no compact counterpart at l - band ,",
    "although extended emission is present .    to obtain ec1 , el1 and el2 peak intensities , we first estimated the background emission where these compact sources lay .",
    "we solved for the zero level emission ( @xmath22 at c - band and @xmath23 at l - band ) using the task imfit within aips .",
    "we then subtracted this value from the maximum intensity found at the positions of each compact source , in order to obtain their @xmath24 . in table",
    "[ tab : cc_l3 ] we give the positions for ec1 , el1 and el2 , their peak intensities , as well as their estimated @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which are indicative of a non - thermal origin .",
    "ec1 lays on a region where @xmath27 changes with time , suggesting variability within this region .",
    "we note that ec1 is confined to a small area in the first epoch , and then appears to increase in size , as we have mentioned in section [ sec : obs_str ] .",
    "el1 lays in a region with basically no c - band emission , unlike the region where el2 lays where more extended emission is being traced from the first epoch to the third one at c - band . as a consequence , el1 lays in a region which maintains a very steep @xmath27 through time , whilst el2 is found in a region with varying @xmath27 ( figure [ fig : alphapeak ] )",
    ". however , we can not rule out that the @xmath27 variations at el2 are intrinsic .    in the case of ec1 , both the variability of the radio emission ( see section [ subsec : nucspec ] ) and of the spectral index distribution ( see section [ subsec : specmas ] and figure [ fig : alphapeak ] ) are indicative of recent non - thermal activity ( probably due to sne and/or agn activity ) .",
    "el1 and el2 display brightness temperatures similar to those expected from either type ii sne or snrs .",
    "we note that the maximum linear size for el1 and el2 is set by the beam size to @xmath28pc , which is too large for characterising either an individual sn or a snr .",
    "a scenario in which el1 and el2 are clusters of sne is difficult to reconcile with the absence of peaks of emission at c - band in all the evn observing epochs , and with the behaviour of @xmath27 at both el1 and el2 .",
    "these facts suggest that there is no recent activity from young sne in those regions , and favour an scenario in which el1 and el2 are dominated by an old population of radio emitters .",
    "we have presented state - of - the - art radio interferometric images of iras23365 , one of the brightest and farthest ulirgs in the local universe ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "our images reveal the presence of a nuclear region , possibly a starburst - agn composite , with an approximate size of 200pc in l - band , and about 100pc in c - band .",
    "we find that the l- and c - band radio emission peak at different positions , thus suggesting that the nuclear region is composed of at least two zones , dominated by distinct populations of radio emitters .    in the region where the l- and c - band emission overlap",
    ", there is evidence for ongoing non - thermal activity , characterised by very energetic , short - lived particles . during our evn monitoring of iras23365",
    ", we have found flux density variability in the overlapping region , thus resulting in a variation of the spectral index .",
    "this can be explained by the flux density variations of sources therein ( sne , agn , etc . ) and/or by the appearance of new sources ( e.g. , sne ) which would be seen first at higher frequencies and later at lower frequencies @xcite .",
    "the edges of the overlapping region characterised by less energetic , long - lived particles , would be dominated by an old population of radio emitters , probably clumps of snrs , for which we have found two candidates in the third l - band evn epoch .",
    "these facts agree with the classification of iras23365 as a composite system , made by @xcite .",
    "the radio source lifetime at different scales ( as seen with the vla , merlin and the evn arrays ) and at both l- and c - bands , is limited by compton losses .",
    "the sne and snrs , for which we have found evidence , are likely providing the mechanism of re - acceleration , or replenishment of new electrons that is needed to halt the radio energy depletion .",
    "we have found that the equivalent magnetic field strength at galactic ( mapped with the vla ) and nuclear scales ( mapped with the evn ) , 18 and 175@xmath30 g , respectively , correspond to that of a galaxy in an advanced stage of interaction @xcite . the magnetic field in both nuclear and circumnuclear regions is stronger than at galactic scales , thus implying that the lifetime of the electrons undergoing synchrotron losses is shorter ( @xmath31myr ) in the innermost nuclear regions ( with linear size @xmath32kpc ) of iras23365 , and larger ( @xmath33myr ) in the outer regions ( @xmath34kpc ) .",
    "our study of iras23365 ( at @xmath35 ) has shown that high - resolution , high - sensitivity observations are needed if we are to make significant improvement in the detailed understanding of nuclear and circumnuclear starbursts in the local universe .",
    "the resolution we attained using a maximum baseline length of approximately 7,000 km , is not enough to resolve individual compact sources ( e.g. , sne , snrs , agn ) from each other , within the nuclear region of iras23365 ; yet , it could be possible to infer the activity of such compact sources , by carefully monitoring variations of total flux density and spectral index distribution .",
    "for instance , @xcite were able to directly detect sn activity in the b1-nucleus of arp299 , by carefully monitoring the variations in @xmath36 , over several years of vla observations . without spatially resolving each individual sne , they estimated a lower limit for the @xmath37 in that lirg . in the case of iras23365 , where a larger number of sne are expected each year ,",
    "several observations per year would be needed to perform such an indirect study of the sn population in its nuclear region , provided that we are able to distinguish between agn outbursts and sn explosions .",
    "iras23365 is a good example of the situation to be faced when observing galaxies at higher redshifts .",
    "it is expected that the square kilometer array ( ska ) , with a maximum baseline length @xmath38 km , will allow the detection of sources as faint as 50njy , e.g. ccsne , exploding at @xmath39 ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the angular resolution will be a strong limiting factor . in those cases where the nuclear and",
    "even the circumnuclear regions ( i.e. , where we expect most of the sn activity to occur ) of the host galaxy can not be resolved out into their different components , ska s high sensitivity might be of great use to indirectly detect sn activity through the monitoring of flux density variations .        ) , given pixel by pixel ( as obtained from aips ) in the nuclear zone , which we expect to be composed by non - thermal sources ( e.g. sne and agn ) .",
    "note that while the peak of the spectral index distribution varies in the very central region , it becomes steeper towards the edges , thus representing older radio emission .",
    "the sources ec1 , el1 and el2 are marked with crosses ( see section [ sec : compactel ] ) . ]",
