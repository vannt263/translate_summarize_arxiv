    "supernova remnants and pulsar - wind nebulae are prominent galactic synchrotron sources at radio and , often , x - ray wavelengths .",
    "the spatial and spectral analysis of the synchrotron emission can be used to deduce or constrain magnetic - field strengths and orientations . in this review ,",
    "`` supernova remnant '' ( snr ) will be used for shell ( i.e. , non - pulsar - driven ) remnants ; if the emission is due to a pulsar , whether the object is young ( like the crab nebula ) or old ( as in h@xmath3 bow - shock nebulae ) the object will be termed a pulsar - wind nebula ( pwn ) .",
    "thus a snr may contain a pwn , a combination sometimes called a `` composite '' snr .",
    "snrs are primarily radio objects . in the milky way ,",
    "274 are listed in green s ( 2009 ) well - known catalogue ( http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/surveys/snrs/ ) ; most are known only by radio emission .",
    "snrs are well - studied only in local group galaxies where they are bright and large enough to be well - imaged with radio interferometers .",
    "galactic remnants range in angular size from less than @xmath4 to many degrees , and represent a range in ages from about 100 years ( g1.9 + 0.3 ) to over @xmath5 yr , though age estimates are difficult for very old objects .",
    "snrs evolve through various phases as their shock waves decelerate in the ambient medium . very soon",
    "after an explosion ( either type ia or core - collapse ) deposits @xmath6 erg into the ism , a shock wave is driven into the surrounding circumstellar medium ( csm : modified by the progenitor ) or unmodified interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "core - collapse sne eject several solar masses with a range of velocities , typically of order 5,000 km s@xmath7 .",
    "type ia s are thought to represent the thermonuclear disruption of a white dwarf , so eject 1.4 @xmath8 at about 10,000 km s@xmath7 .",
    "not long after the explosion , deceleration of the outer blast wave causes the formation of a reverse shock as inner ejecta are forced to decelerate .",
    "this begins the ejecta phase of evolution , characterized by the presence of both the forward shock ( blast wave ) heating ism or csm , and the reverse shock heating ejecta .",
    "cooling timescales are much longer than dynamical timescales , so this phase is essentially adiabatic .",
    "depending on the density structure in the ejecta and surrounding material , the shock radius may evolve as @xmath9 @xcite . eventually the reverse shock moves in to the center of the snr and , after what may be extensive reverberations , disappears . by this time",
    "( several thousand years for typical parameters ) , several times the ejected mass have been swept up by the blast wave , and the remnant is settling into the sedov phase , well described by the similarity solution for a point explosion in a uniform medium , with shock radius obeying @xmath10 .",
    "this phase is adiabatic as well .",
    "eventually , cooling times in shocked ism become comparable to the remnant age , and shocks become radiative : lossy and optically prominent .",
    "this typically occurs when shock velocities @xmath11 drop to around 200 km s@xmath7 .",
    "denser regions around the remnant periphery may become radiative before other parts ; even young snrs ( like kepler , sn 1604 ) can show radiative shocks in some regions .",
    "once the bulk of the blast wave is radiative , the deceleration is more marked .",
    "the remnant interior will remain hot for some time , producing what is known as a `` pressure - driven snowplow . ''",
    "eventually , the remnant becomes sufficiently confused as to lose its identity , and the remaining kinetic energy is dissipated as sound waves in the ism .",
    "various blast - wave solutions are described in @xcite ; particular applications to snrs are made in @xcite .",
    "the prevalence of radio emission from adiabatic - phase snrs , with low shock compression ratios , indicates that particle acceleration must be ongoing ; simple compression of ambient galactic magnetic field and cosmic - ray electrons would produce both insufficiently bright emission and the wrong spectrum @xcite .",
    "since 1977 , the traditional explanation for this electron acceleration has been diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ; see blandford & eichler 1987 for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "electrons emitting synchrotron radiation at radio wavelengths have energies of order 1  10 gev ( @xmath12 gev ) .",
    "the observed radio power - law spectra @xmath13 , with @xmath14 ( see figure  [ spix ] ) , imply from synchrotron theory a power - law energy distribution of electrons @xmath15 electrons @xmath16 erg@xmath7 with @xmath17 .",
    "radio observations do not allow the separate deduction of energy in electrons and in magnetic field ; the synchrotron emissivity of this power - law distribution of electrons is proportional to @xmath18 , or roughly to the product of energy density in electrons and in magnetic field .",
    "if particle and magnetic - field energies were in equipartition ( the minimum - energy state producing an observed spectrum ) , the magnetic - field strength could be deduced . for a spherical remnant of radius @xmath19 pc at distance @xmath20 kpc with @xmath21 , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the flux density at 1 ghz in jy , @xmath24 is the volume filling factor , and @xmath25 is the ratio of energy density in ions to that in electrons ( e.g. , pacholczyk 1970 ) .",
    "but there is no obvious reason that equipartition should hold : snrs are typically very inefficient synchrotron radiators , with a very small fraction of the @xmath26 erg required to produce the observed emission .",
    "thermal energies are very much larger than either particle or field energy .",
    "thus equipartition magnetic - field strengths are really just a measure of ( approximately ) remnant surface brightness .",
    "the question of magnetic - field amplification in strong snr shocks , to be discussed at length below , is intimately related to the question of shock modification by cosmic - ray pressure ( efficient shock acceleration , or nonlinear dsa ) .",
    "thus evidence for nonlinear dsa is related to estimation of magnetic - field strengths .",
    "one prediction of this theory is the gradual deceleration of incoming flow ( in the shock frame ) by forward - diffusing cosmic rays , so that the compression ratio @xmath27 varies continuously from a possibly large value ( far upstream velocity / downstream velocity , perhaps 10 or more ) to about 3 , at which point most calculations show the development of a `` thermal subshock '' on a length scale of thermal proton gyroradius , much smaller than other length scales .",
    "( see figure  [ shockfig ] . ) in test - particle ( inefficient ) dsa , well - known results give the spectrum of accelerated particles as a power - law with energy index @xmath28 depending only on the shock compression ratio , @xmath29 .",
    "since strong adiabatic shocks are expected to have @xmath30 ( for adiabatic index @xmath31 ) , we predict @xmath32 which implies @xmath33 , close to the mean of the distribution of over 200 snr values from green s catalogue .",
    "however , the dispersion in that distribution is substantial ( see figure  [ spix ] ) ; explaining values of @xmath3 of 0.6  0.7 , typical for young snrs , or as low as 0.3 , sometimes seen in older snrs , is not straightforward .",
    "low mach - number shocks will have lower compressions : in fact , for mach number @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "for @xmath36 , this can significantly increase the steepness of the predicted spectrum ; but this is demonstrably not the case in the young remnants with the steeper spectra . no variation in shock mach number",
    "can explain @xmath37 ; traditional explanations involve confusing thermal emission or other instrumental effects , but remain unconvincing .         and downstream @xmath38 .",
    "dotted line : test - particle shock ( velocity discontinuity ) .",
    "solid line : shock modified by cosmic rays . ]",
    "a consistent explanation for steeper radio spectra in young remnants is available , however .",
    "particles of a particular energy will diffuse ( on average ) a certain distance ahead of an efficient shock , where they will see a particular effective compression ratio , which fixes the slope of the distribution function near that energy .",
    "if , as expected , more energetic particles diffuse further , they will see larger compression ratios and the spectrum will become flatter .",
    "thus one predicts spectra flattening ( hardening ) to higher energy , an effect first pointed out by eichler ( 1979 ) .",
    "this effect was quantified in a monte carlo simulation of electron acceleration , and compared with radio observations of young snrs , which did seem to show the effect ( ellison & reynolds 1991 ; reynolds & ellison 1992 ; see figure 3 ) .",
    "the prediction for the emitted synchrotron spectrum depends on the magnetic - field strength ; stronger fields mean lower - energy particles producing radiation in a particular radio - astronomical bandpass .",
    "reynolds & ellison found that explaining the relatively steep spectra of tycho s and kepler s snrs required magnetic fields of up to 1 mg and above , though with substantial errors .",
    "mg , the solid line to 1 mg , and the dot - dashed line to 0.1 mg ; for sn 1006 , the dashed , solid , and dot - dashed lines correspond to @xmath39 mg , 0.1 mg , and 1 @xmath1 g , respectively .",
    "the dotted line shows the spectrum that would be produced if electrons had the same energy distribution as protons , showing how differently the nonlinear shock treats electrons and protons .",
    "( reynolds & ellison 1992 ) ]    the degree of order in the magnetic field in snrs can be directly inferred from the degree of polarization of synchrotron radiation ( subject to observational issues such as faraday depolarization and resolution effects [ beam depolarization ] ) .",
    "the degree of linear polarization of power - law synchrotron radiation from electrons in a uniform magnetic field is given by @xmath40 , so that @xmath41% .",
    "such high values are never observed in snrs ; a few older snrs such as da 530 show @xmath42% in some regions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure  [ da530 ] ) , but historical shells show much lower values , 10  15% ( see references in reynolds & gilmore 1993 ) .",
    "very roughly , the observed polarized fraction over the maximum possible gives an estimate of the fractional energy in the ordered component of the magnetic field @xcite ; thus in tycho , for instance ( see figure  [ tychopol ] [ reynoso et al .",
    "1997 ] ) , less than 15% of the magnetic energy is in an ordered component . however , the direction of that component is radial , a peculiar property shared by the other historical shells sn 1006 , cas a , kepler , and g11.2 - 0.3 .",
    "the nature of this radial component is unclear ; while radial motions such as predicted to occur at the rayleigh - taylor unstable contact discontinuity between shocked ejecta and shocked ism might enhance radial field , this effect should occur somewhat interior , while radial fields are observed immediately at remnant edges ( e.g. , tycho : dickel et al .",
    "various mhd simulations have been performed in an attempt to understand this effect @xcite . in older remnants such as da 530 , magnetic fields are generally confused or tangential .",
    "tangential fields can readily be explained by simple compression in radiative shocks with large @xmath27 , and this is the conventional explanation .",

    "the discovery of x - ray synchrotron emission from snrs dates from the early 1980 s ( toor 1980 ; becker et al .",

'' or rx j0852 - 4622 ) . of these ,",
    "the first two are young , with symmetric x - ray morphologies , and show thermal x - ray emission from fainter regions .",
    "sn 1006 is widely accepted to be the remnant of a type ia supernova ( evidence includes the presence of balmer - dominated optical emission from the forward shock , and the high galactic latitude of @xmath44 ) ; the evidence is not as firm for g1.9 + 0.3 , but it is also suspected to be a type ia remnant @xcite .",
    "the other two have much larger angular sizes and considerably more irregular morphologies @xcite ; they also show no trace of thermal x - rays , putting severe upper limits on the presence of any thermal gas @xcite .",
    "both also contain x - ray point sources , suggesting a core - collapse origin .",

    "power - law fits to the x - ray spectra are much steeper than radio spectra , indicating that the x - rays come from the cutting - off tail of the electron distribution .",
    "three limitations might be imagined for the maximum energy to which electrons can be accelerated due to dsa : finite age or size of the remnant , lack of mhd scattering waves above some @xmath47 , or radiative losses .",
    "the first two mechanisms would restrict ion acceleration as well , but radiative losses would affect electrons only .",
    "the cutoffs are likely to be exponentials or modified exponentials , so that the electron distribution is roughly given by @xmath48 .",

    "if we write @xmath59 , with @xmath60 the `` gyrofactor , '' depending on the amplitude of scattering turbulence , then @xmath61 is bohm diffusion and @xmath62const.@xmath63 is `` bohm - like '' .",

    "bohm diffusion is often taken as a limiting case , @xmath67 , but it has been argued that @xmath68 is the possible outcome of some cosmic - ray driven instabilities ( bell & lucek 2001 ; bell 2004 ) .",
    "relevant for using x - ray spectra as a diagnostic of magnetic fields is that high fields give short mean free paths , small diffusion coefficients , rapid acceleration , and higher maximum particle energies .",
    "counterpart [ winkler et al .",
    "2003 ] . ]    two classes of argument for high magnetic fields in young snrs come from the last decade of observations with high - resolution , high throughput x - ray observatories : _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton , _ and _ suzaku_. a morphological argument is based on the commonly seen phenomenon of `` thin rims , '' in which synchrotron x - ray emission occurs at remnant peripheries in very narrow tangential features coincident with the shock location as inferred , e.g. , from h@xmath3 observations ( see figure  [ sn1006fils ] ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite argued that the small radial extent resulted from synchrotron losses on electrons , to infer strong amplification of @xmath0 : @xmath69 @xcite , where @xmath70 is the filament width .",
    "values of @xmath0 from 60 to 230 @xmath1 g have been inferred for tycho , kepler , sn 1006 , cas a , and g347.3 - 0.5 @xcite .",
    "these field strengths apply only to regions where x - ray synchrotron emission is seen , of course .",
    "an alternative explanation for the disappearance of synchrotron emission such a short distance behind the shock is that the magnetic field is primarily turbulent , and decays on a short lengthscale @xcite .",
    "tests attempting to discriminate between these two possibilities somewhat favor the radiative - loss explanation , but are not yet conclusive @xcite .",
    "one particular difficulty is the presence of thin rims in radio images as well ( see figure  [ tychorx ] ) ; since radio - emitting electrons have enormously longer loss timescales , disappearance of the magnetic field is the only alternative .",
    "it is possible that both processes operate ; theoretical models for strong magnetic - field amplification in modified shocks produce turbulent magnetic field which might well have some decay mechanism to compete with electron energy losses .",
    "another argument for ( locally ) strong magnetic fields is the discovery of variations in brightness on timescales of a few years of small features in x - ray synchrotron emission in cas a @xcite and g347.3 - 0.5 @xcite .",
    "again , factors of 2 drop in brightness on a timescale of years require @xmath71 mg . brightness increases on similar timescales are also observed ; demanding acceleration times of years gives similar estimates for @xmath0 . however",
    ", very strong levels of magnetic turbulence also naturally predict these kinds of fluctuations @xcite without necessarily requiring quite as high values of @xmath72 .",
    "however , the remnant of sn 1006 shows no such small features or brightness variations @xcite , perhaps as a result of a type ia origin with more - or - less uniform surrounding material . ( the absence of short - term variations does not imply absence of magnetic - field amplification ;",
    "very high @xmath0 values could be generated in a quasi - steady state behind the shock , without producing short - term brightness fluctuations . )",
    "new arguments relative to magnetic - field strengths in snrs have resulted from the new generation of gev - tev observational capabilities .",
    "the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope has been mapping the sky between about 0.2 and 300 gev since its launch in 2008 , with gradually improving statistics on any given region of sky .",
    "one important early result is the detection of cas a between 0.5 and 50 gev ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see figure  [ casa ] ) .",
    "the emission may be either leptonic , that is , electron bremsstrahlung plus inverse - compton upscattering of local photon fields , or hadronic , from the decay into photons of @xmath73 mesons produced in inelastic collisions between cosmic - ray protons and local thermal gas .",
    "the bremsstrahlung and hadronic contributions require knowledge of the gas density ; the ic contribution requires knowledge of appropriate photon fields .",
    "the leptonic model shown in figure  [ casa ] assumes a mean density of 26 cm@xmath7 , which requires a mean magnetic field ( averaged over the entire emitting region of cas a ) of about 0.12 mg .",
    "if the actual emission is hadronic , the ic contribution must be lower ( fewer relativistic electrons ) , demanding a larger magnetic field to produce the observed synchrotron fluxes at radio energies .",
    "( this argument was originally made based on early upper limits above 100 mev from cos - b and sas-2 ; cowsik and sarkar [ 1980 ] derived a lower limit of about 1 mg . )        similarly , any tev detection or upper limit places lower limits on the mean magnetic field in regions containing relativistic electrons .",
    "so far , four snrs have been imaged with the hess air - erenkov telescope array in namibia .",
    "these include three of the synchrotron - dominated remnants : sn 1006 , g347.3 - 0.5 , and vela jr .",
    "( the fourth , g1.9 + 0.3 , is too small for hess imaging and too faint for a constraining upper limit ) .",
    "in addition , the ( probably ) historical shell snr rcw 86 has been detected @xcite . in all cases , the tev morphology tracks the x - ray morphology surprisingly closely .",
    "however , detailed attempts to model the emission as either due to hadronic or to leptonic processes run into significant problems . for hadronic models , required target gas densities seem to exceed measurements or upper limits on local thermal gas , while simple leptonic models do not do a good job reproducing the spectral shape and may also require implausibly small filling factors of magnetic field .",
    "however , lower limits to @xmath75 do not depend much on the detailed modeling . in sn",
    "1006 @xcite , @xmath76 g is required ; for g347.3 - 0.5 , a leptonic model @xcite demands a filling factor of magnetic field of only 1% to avoid overpredicting synchrotron emission . within that 1% of the volume",
    ", the field is a modest 15 @xmath1 g .",
    "( these estimates are relatively insensitive to model details ; even a model that does not use dsa at all as a particle acceleration mechanism , but rather stochastic acceleration in the downstream region , fits the most recent gev and tev data for g347.3 - 0.5 with a leptonic model with @xmath77 g ; fan , liu , & fryer 2010 ) .",
    "hadronic models typically invoke much higher fields ( zirakashvili & aharonian [ 2010 ] find @xmath78 g in g347.3 - 0.5 ) .",
    "hess has also detected several other sources coincident with shell snrs , such as ctb37b ( hess j1713 - 381 ; aharonian et al .",
    "2008 ) and hess j1731 - 347 ( acero et al .",
    "these may be further members of the nonthermal - x - ray class , older snrs interacting with molecular clouds , or pwne .",
    "they await further observational clarification .",
    "the question of magnetic - field amplification is intimately connected with that of efficient particle acceleration through the proposals of bell & lucek ( 2001 ) and bell ( 2004 ) that cosmic - ray driven instabilities can greatly increase the magnetic - field strength .",
    "evidence for high magnetic fields is then taken as indirect evidence for an energetically significant component of cosmic rays ( which must of necessity be ions ) accelerated in the shock .",
    "this argument can be reversed : if evidence is found for efficient ion acceleration , then magnetic fields are likely to be amplified .",
    "the nature of magnetic - field amplification at strong shocks is a subject of intense theoretical activity .",
    "observations can provide powerful constraints on some aspects of such amplification .",
    "in particular , two snrs , sn 1006 and g1.9 + 0.3 , show very simple bilaterally symmetric morphology which may contain clues to the dependence of particle acceleration and magnetic - field amplification processes on the shock obliquity angle @xmath79 between the mean upstream magnetic field direction and the shock velocity .",

    "the most natural explanation for the bilateral symmetry evident in figures  [ sn1006x ] and [ g1.9 ] is the variation in @xmath80 one would encounter at different locations as a spherical shock encounters a roughly uniform magnetic field .",
    "if the field lies in the plane of the sky , the range in obliquities would be 0 to @xmath81 ; if there is a line - of - sight component , the range drops until it is zero for * b * along the line of sight . later in this chapter",
    "we describe a detailed calculation of the radio synchrotron morphologies resulting from different assumptions about the nature of the upstream magnetic field and of particle acceleration . here",
    "we focus on the x - ray spectral variations each remnant displays .",
    "a simple model adequately characterizing most synchrotron x - ray emission from shell snrs is the `` srcut '' model in the xspec software package , which is the spectrum emitted by a power - law electron distribution with an exponential cutoff .",
    "the frequency corresponding to the cutoff energy @xmath52 is @xmath82 , the `` rolloff '' frequency ( so called because the synchrotron spectrum from this distribution actually steepens rather gradually ) .",
    "@xmath82 serves as a good indicator of the maximum energy reached by electrons at different locations , although depending on the mechanism limiting that maximum energy , @xmath82 has different dependencies on physical parameters .",
    "if the acceleration rate of particles varies with shock obliquity ( independently of any obliquity - variations of the magnetic field ) , we can parameterize such effects in terms of a quantity @xmath83 : @xmath84 .",

    "while there are no comprehensive predictions , calculations of magnetic - field amplification normally assume parallel shocks ( @xmath91 ) , with the process being less effective at higher obliquities .",
    "the strong @xmath0-dependence for age or escape - limited acceleration could easily explain the observations  but with the serious side effect of predicting that the resulting maximum energies ( @xmath92 10  100 tev ) would apply to ions as well as electrons , putting at least these two snrs out of the running for producing cosmic rays up to the `` knee '' , the slight steepening in the integrated spectrum of galactic cosmic rays at earth .",
    "loss - limited maximum energies do depend on the shock speed , but the required variation by over 30 in @xmath82 would demand an implausible factor of 5 variation in the current shock velocity .",
    "anisotropic diffusion @xcite could produce more rapid acceleration at quasi - perpendicular shocks than quasi - parallel ( @xmath93 ) , easily explaining the required amount of variation ( figure  [ rj ] ) .",

    "all young pulsars are slowing down in their rotation . the corresponding rate of change of rotational kinetic energy is enormous , typically in the range @xmath100 ergs s@xmath7 . in most cases",
    "only a negligible amount of energy is contained in the electromagnetic radiation corresponding to the neutron star s observed pulsations .",
    "rather , the bulk of the rotational power is usually deposited into a relativistic magnetized particle wind that flows outward from the pulsar .",
    "external pressure will cause this wind to abruptly decelerate at a termination shock . beyond the termination shock ,",
    "the pulsar wind thermalizes in pitch angle and radiates synchrotron emission , resulting in a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) .",
    "the best known pwn is the crab nebula ( fig .",
    "[ crab ] ) , powered by the central young pulsar b0531 + 21 .",
    "the crab nebula radiates synchrotron emission across the electromagnetic spectrum . in x - rays , its extent is small , reflecting the relatively short synchrotron lifetimes of electrons emitting at these energies .",
    "the optical synchrotron emission is larger , reflecting the longer lifetimes of the corresponding electron population . and",
    "finally , the radio emission shows the full extent of the source , with a radiative lifetime exceeding the age of the source ( @xmath101  years ) .",
    "pwne and snrs have a variety of common properties : they both result from a supernova explosion , and they both are characterized by their polarized radio synchrotron emission .",
    "this has led to considerable confusion in the literature .",
    "for example , the crab nebula is often described as a `` supernova remnant '' , despite the shell or blast - wave that would normally correspond to a snr remaining as yet unidentified in this source @xcite .",
    "some pwne have for historical reasons been cataloged as `` filled - center supernova remnants '' @xcite , while others , discovered more recently , have been excluded from such lists . as we describe below",
    ", a young snr may contain a pwn , a combination often called a composite remnant ( e.g. , g21.5 - 0.9 ; fig .",
    "[ g21 ] ) .",
    "the key differences between snrs and pwne are as follows :    * * energy source : * snrs result from an essentially instantaneous deposition of energy , in the form of a blast wave driven into the ism by a supernova explosion .",
    "in contrast , pwne have a continuous power source , the bulk relativistic flow of electron / positron pairs from an energetic neutron star . * * radio morphology : * as a direct result of their differing sources of energy , snrs and pwne have distinct radio morphologies .",
    "snrs are usually limb - brightened shells of synchrotron emission , while pwne are typically amorphous or filled - center synchrotron nebulae , brightest at the pulsar s position . * * radio spectral index : * snrs usually have relatively steep radio spectral indices , @xmath102 , as shown in figure  [ spix ] .",
    "in contrast , pwne have spectral indices in the range , @xmath103 , which is too flat to be explained by simple models of diffusive shock acceleration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* * angular extent : * snrs are long - lived objects with a wide range of sizes , with angular extents ranging from @xmath104 to @xmath105 .",
    "pwne are usually relatively small , with sizes in the range @xmath106 to @xmath107 , although a few older pwne may be significantly larger ( e.g. , vela x ; fig .",
    "[ vela ] ) . *",
    "* fractional polarization : * at radio frequencies near 1  ghz , snrs typically have modest amounts of linear polarization , at the level of 5%10% .",
    "pwne usually have very well - organized magnetic fields , with correspondingly higher polarization fractions , in the range 30%50% .",
    "theoretical expectations predict three main phases in the evolution of a pwn @xcite , governed in turn by :    1 .",
    "the expansion of the pwn ; 2 .",
    "interaction of the pwn with the surrounding snr ; 3 .",
    "the motion of the pulsar powering the pwn .",
    "each of these phases is discussed in more detail below .      at early stages in a pwn s evolution ,",
    "the pulsar s spin - down luminosity remains relatively constant , so that there is a steady injection of energy into the pwn . as a consequence ,",
    "the pwn expands supersonically into the surrounding low - pressure environment , with the radius , @xmath19 , of the pwn evolving with time , @xmath108 , as @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "thus the pwn drives a shock into the inner edge of the expanding sn ejecta ( see fig .",
    "[ g21 ] ) .",
    "many pulsars are born with high space velocities , up to and beyond 1000  km  s@xmath7 . however , because the sound speed inside the pwn is much higher than this , the pwn stays relatively centered on the pulsar , and has a quasi - spherical appearance .        inside the pwn , there are two broad zones .",
    "close to the pulsar is the unshocked wind zone , in which particles and poynting flux flow freely outward from the central star .",
    "the pressure in this wind drops with increasing distance from the pulsar , until we reach a termination shock at which the wind is confined by external pressure . at this shock",
    "the wind particles are accelerated up to even higher lorentz factors , and have their pitch angles scattered so that they can emit synchrotron radiation .",
    "observations of this emission allow us to infer the composition of the wind at and immediately downstream of the shock .",
    "specifically , the parameter @xmath110 corresponds to the ratio of electromagnetic energy to particle energy at the wind shock , and is usually much less than one @xcite : the shocked wind is particle - dominated ( @xmath111 ) , in contrast to the unshocked wind which is expected to be radiation - dominated ( @xmath112 ) .    beyond the termination shock",
    "is the second main zone , the emitting region of the pwn , in which the bulk flow continues to decelerate to match the external boundary conditions , and where synchrotron emission is produced .",
    "the morphology of a pwn in this early phase of evolution has been spectacularly revealed by x - ray images of the crab nebula taken by the _ chandra x - ray observatory _",
    "these observations show that the crab nebula is dominated by a bright x - ray torus .",
    "the inner part of this torus is bounded by a bright x - ray ring , thought to correspond to the wind termination shock . to the south of the pulsar",
    ", an x - ray jet runs along the axis of the torus , apparently originating very close to the central pulsar before curving slightly at large distances from the center .",
    "a faint counter - jet can also be seen to the north .",
    "the torus is thought to result from the poynting flux concentrated in equatorial regions of the system by the wound - up magnetic field .",
    "however , a key point , first noted by @xcite , is that the termination shock radius should decrease with increasing angle from the equator .",
    "the axial jet seen for the crab nebula is therefore not a jet originating from the pulsar itself , but is part of the post - shock wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations show that at mid - latitudes , the external pressure can reverse the post - shock particle flow .",
    "the wind flows back along the surface of the termination shock toward the poles @xcite , at which points it is collimated into jets by hoop stress .",
    "simulations thus can do a reasonable job of reproducing the morphological properties of the crab nebula , as a result of a latitude - dependent termination - shock radius with a flow reversal .",
    "recently published optical polarimetry of the crab nebula using the _ hubble space telescope _  has revealed spectacular details of this pwn s large - scale magnetic field @xcite .",
    "a great deal of fibrous structure seen in polarization corresponds to the local field direction , while the torus of the nebula appears to be confined by a poloidal component of the field .",
    "a pwn moves into a new phase of evolution when its outer boundary collides with the reverse shock from the snr in which it is embedded .",
    "this typically occurs after @xmath113  years for the typical case of a @xmath26  erg supernova ejecting 10 solar masses into an ambient ism of density 1 atom @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the collision with the reverse shock initially compresses the pwn , and the system may reverberate for a couple of cycles before establishing a new equilibrium @xcite    the compression of the pwn raises the internal magnetic field , resulting in substantial synchrotron burn - off at high energies .",
    "the x - ray extent of a pwn in this phase can therefore be rather small .",
    "furthermore , if the pulsar has a high space velocity or if the surrounding ism is inhomogeneous , then the reverse shock does not collide with all parts of the pwn at the same time . as a result of this asymmetric collision",
    ", the pulsar can end up substantially offset from the center of its pwn , and the pwn s radio morphology can take on a chaotic or filamentary appearance @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ vela ] ) .          since a pulsar moves ballistically while the surrounding snr decelerates in its expansion , any pulsar with a significant space velocity will eventually begin to move toward the snr s rim .",
    "for a snr in the sedov phase , the sound - speed in the remnant s interior drops with increasing distance from the center .",
    "specifically , @xcite has shown that for a sedov snr , the pulsar s motion will become supersonic when it has moved 68% of the way to the snr s rim , which occurs at 50% of the total time taken for the pulsar to escape the snr completely . once the pulsar becomes supersonic , a new , bow - shock , pwn is formed , which no longer expands and which is externally confined by the ram pressure resulting from the pulsar s motion .",
    "eventually the pulsar escapes the snr completely , and now drives a bow shock through the ambient ism @xcite ( see fig .  [ mouse ] ) .",
    "we can infer the strength of the magnetic field inside pwne through various techniques : by assuming equipartition between particles and magnetic fields averaged over an assumed synchrotron emitting volume ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , by measuring the radius of the termination shock from a high - resolution x - ray image and combining this with a physical model for the flow to estimate the field value at this location ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "de jager & djannati - ata ( 2008 ) review gev / tev emission from pwne .",
    "these approaches show that pwne can have a wide range of nebular magnetic fields , from @xmath1145  @xmath1 g to @xmath1151  mg .",
    "the magnetic field strength generally depends strongly on @xmath116 , @xmath108 and @xmath110 , as well as on the pulsar braking index .",
    "a variety of magnetic field orientations have been inferred in pwne from the angles of their radio polarization .",
    "some pwne show a broadly toroidal magnetic field , some show a radial magnetic field , and in others there is a complex or tangled appearance . @xcite",
    "have suggested that all pwne have predominantly toroidal magnetic fields , but that these different polarization patterns result from differences in viewing angle .",
    "toroidal polarization vectors , such as seen for the pwn g106.6 + 2.9 , result when the observer looks along the pulsar s spin axis @xcite .",
    "radial fields , such as seen in the pwn g21.50.9 @xcite correspond to a viewing angle perpendicular to the spin axis . and",
    "more complex magnetic field morphologies , as for the pwn 3c  58 @xcite , occur for oblique viewing angles .",
    "the complex polarization properties of systems like 3c  58 may also occur as a result of kink instabilities , which can produce sheared loops of magnetic field throughout the nebula @xcite .",
    "there are only limited observations of magnetic fields in pulsar bow shocks .",
    "the theoretical expectation is that the system forms a toroidal field near the apex of the bow shock , but that the magnetic field is collimated in the trailing magnetotail .",
    "radio polarimetry matching this prediction has recently been observed by @xcite for the bow - shock pwn powered by psr  j15095850 .",
    "however , other magnetic field geometries have also been seen ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that the magnetic field structure of bow - shock pwne may depend on whether the pulsar s spin axis aligns or mis - aligns with its velocity vector ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "there are many aspects of pwne which are still active areas of investigation .",
    "two particular areas of focus are as follows .",
    "first , several pwne have now been observed to show substantial time variability in their morphology and intensity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these observations have provided a rich suite of information , but we now need relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations to fully understand the flow conditions and instabilities that produce these effects @xcite .",
    "second , while we have a multitude of observations of pulsar winds after they have been shocked , we have very limited data on the composition and transportation mechanism in the unshocked wind zone . targeted observations and modeling of unique systems such as psr  j07373039a / b ( the `` double pulsar '' ) may provide vital insights in this regard @xcite .",
    "the radio morphology of supernova remnants ( snrs ) may be very informative of the conditions of the magnetized environments in which the blast - wave expansion occurs and , in particular , on the acceleration processes at the shock front which give rise to the energetic electrons ultimately responsible of the synchrotron emission in the radio and ( possibly ) x - ray band . in this context , the bilaterally symmetric or barrel - shaped bsnrs @xcite , @xcite )",
    "are considered ideal laboratories , because their morphology is definitely the result of the lack of small scale inhomogeneties which may confuse the interpretations . a point - like explosion in a uniform magnetized medium with constant strength and direction of * b",
    "* should give rise to a symmetric bsnr whose bright limbs are located where the magnetic field is parallel or perpendicular to the shock speed , if the injection efficiency is greatest where the shock is quasi - parallel or quasi - perpendicular / isotropic , respectively , and if * b * lies in the plane of the sky , whereas different configurations occur at different aspect angles ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , in real life , bsnrs are often asymmetric , and therefore @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) have recently generalized the study of @xcite to the cases in which the explosions occur in a large scale gradient of density or magnetic field , showing that this model is able to reproduce most of the asymmetries observed in real bsnrs . in particular , the radio morphology loses one axis of symmetry , and the limbs are not equally bright ( if the gradient runs across the limbs ) or they are not opposite and they converge on the side in which the density or the magnetic field is increasing ( if the gradient runs between and parallel to the limbs ) .",
    "it is clear that morphology of bsnrs is tightly coupled to the magnetized environments in which the shock expands , and it is of particular interest to note here the preference of bsnr symmetry axes to be oriented parallel to the galactic plane , as reported by @xcite .",
    "it seems therefore possible to study their morphology to derive the geometry of the surrounding magnetic field , thus shedding more light on the microphysics of the particle acceleration processes at the shock front .",
    "the remnant of sn 1006 seems to be the object in which this kind of study may be most fruitful .",
    "the uniform environment and the bright limbs visible in most of the electromagnetic spectrum make it a real case study in the field of particle acceleration mechanisms in strong shocks .",
    "indeed , @xcite , using a simple and powerful geometrical argument applied to the  x - ray image of sn 1006 , based on the ratio between the central and the rim luminosity , showed that if the remnant is cylindrically symmetric , the bright limbs are likely to be polar caps ( instead of an equatorial belt ) and that , therefore , the magnetic field is oriented perpendicular to the bright limbs , in the ne - sw direction . this argument seems to break the dichotomy between the two competing scenarios of the dependence of the electron injection efficiency or electron acceleration rate on @xmath79 , preferring a situation in which the injection is most efficient or acceleration most rapid when the field is along the shock speed ( quasi - parallel scenario ) over the situation in which the field is perpendicular ( quasi - perpendicular scenario , see @xcite ) .",
    "on one hand , these findings were somehow expected since @xcite already pointed out that in sn 1006 the injection should be maximum at parallel shocks . however , in the light of the uncertainties related to the details of the acceleration processes , several authors still considered the quasi - perpendicular scenario a viable option : @xcite argued against the quasi - parallel scenario pointing out that quasi - parallel models often give rise to unobserved morphologies in the radio band ; @xcite still considered both models to explain the observed width of selected filaments of sn 1006 observed by @xcite , whereas @xcite developed a quasi - perpendicular model which agrees very well with the same data .",
    "moreover , the same simple geometrical argument of @xcite , if applied to the radio image , would be in agreement with the equatorial belt ( cfr .",

    "recently , @xcite have further investigated this issue , showing that , in the framework of a simple model of sn 1006 in terms of a point - like explosion occurring in a uniform density and uniform magnetic field medium , there is no way to reconcile the quasi - parallel scenario and the sn 1006 morphology as observed in the radio band .",
    "this contradiction between the radio morphology ( suggesting quasi - perpendicular injection efficiency scenario ) and x - ray morphology ( suggesting quasi - parallel scenario ) has prompted us to investigate the effects of non - uniformity of the environment on the observed properties of this remnant , capitalizing on the work of @xcite on asymmetric bsnrs .    in sect .",

    "3.4 we will discuss the results of the comparison , showing that , not only can the model invoking a gradient of @xmath118 reconcile , for the first time , the radio and x - ray morphology of the remnant , but it also provides stringent constraints on the overall geometry of the field in the vicinity of the remnant .         since there is accumulated evidence that the density around sn 1006 is fairly constant , with the exception of the nw sector where an encounter with a dense cloud is occurring ( @xcite , @xcite ) , we argue that a model with a @xmath118 gradient is more appropriate to describe the asymmetries of the limbs of sn 1006 .",

    "the simulations were stopped at @xmath123 yr , checking that the shock velocity and remnant radius are compatible with the observed values ( 4600 km s@xmath7 and 9.6 pc , respectively ) .",

    "the definitions of @xmath125 and @xmath124 are sketched in figure [ angles ] . for the purposes of this work , we have chosen to synthesize our maps in the following way : first , we apply a rotation of @xmath124 degrees around an axis passing through the center of the remnant and parallel to the limbs , where positive angles mean that regions of increasing * b * are closer to us .",

    "the proposed method of comparison between models of synchrotron radio emission and the real observational data of bilateral snrs is based on the calculation of 4 morphological parameters , and we have seen that we get a good fit for a quasi - parallel injection efficiency scenario if we include a gradient of * b * and a worse fit in case of quasi - perpendicular scenario with the same gradient .",
    "this means that an agreement is found between the overall observed morphology of sn 1006 and our model , which corresponds to well defined values of the viewing geometry angles ( @xmath157 and @xmath158 ) .",
    "we know that the angle between the sn 1006 axis of symmetry and the galactic plane is roughly @xmath128 , and that its distance is 2.2 kpc and its galactic latitude is @xmath159 . combining all this information , we can plot the direction of the magnetic field and its gradient in a 3d representation of the galactic disk .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ magf3d ] .",
    "( top panel ) but for quasi - perpendicular scenario .",
    "there is no @xmath154 angle in this case , because * b * is always aligned with @xmath153 .",
    "_ lower panel : _ scatter plot of @xmath145 parameters .",
    "we overplotted the values observed in sn 1006.,width=340 ]        remarkably , the direction of @xmath122 points down toward the plane and the direction of * b * is aligned with the direction of the spiral arm near the remnant .",
    "this is indeed a very reasonable configuration for the magnetic field at this position in the galaxy , because models of galactic * b * indicates that at this location above the plane the field still retaines spiral arms features , even if having smaller amplitudes .",
    "therefore , it is tempting to conclude that we are sampling the large scale field of the galaxy .",
    "however , we note that the best - fit value of @xmath122 ( i.e. a variation of 1.4 times over 10 pc ) seems to be high to be associated with the large scale * b * of the galaxy .",
    "we have used the model of @xcite to compute the expected variation of the azimuthal field in the galaxy at the location of sn 1006 . in particular , we have used their _ ass+ring _ model which seems to be favored by rotation measures of pulsars in the plane . at a distance of @xmath160 pc from the plane for the sn 1006 remnant , the large - scale field is expected to vary by a factor of 1.4 on scales of more than 100 pc , much longer than the scale - length required by our model fit .",
    "this opens up the possibility that we are actually sampling the random magnetic field component .",
    "@xcite reports length scales for this component of the order of few pc , which is compatible with the variations we derive .",
    "the synchrotron radio emission of the archetypical bilateral supernova remnant sn 1006 is compared against an mhd and emission model for this remnant , including a gradient of the external magnetic field , particle acceleration and its obliquity dependence , namely quasi - perpendicular , quasi - parallel , and isotropic scenarios for the injection efficiency . in order to explore the parameter space , which is very large due to the necessity of including the viewing geometry in the model - data comparison",
    ", we developed a simplified procedure based on the computation of four morphological parameters .",
    "we have found a very good fit with a model assuming quasi - parallel injection efficiency and an aspect angle @xmath151 between the direction of * b * the line of sight , and @xmath161 between the plane of the sky and the direction of the gradient of the magnetic field , and a variation of * b * of about 1.4 times over a scale of 10 pc . a worse fit is obtained with quasi - perpendicular scenario .",
    "the overall morphology of the observed radio emission at 1.4 ghz is correctly recovered by our best - fit model .",
    "the projected direction of * b * and @xmath162 in the galaxy are along the spiral arm and toward the plane respectively , which is in very good agreement with the expected direction of the large scale galactic * b*. however , the implied gradient is too high to be associated with the large - scale galactic * b * and more typical of the random magnetic field components .",
    "the application of our method to selected samples of bilateral supernova remnants may yield independent estimates of the geometry of the galactic field at several locations , which can be useful to understand the field topology in our galaxy .",
