    "a simplified eke protocol is as follows@xmath5}$ ] :    let @xmath6 be the encryption / decryption algorithms using password @xmath3 as its key , the public domain parameters are group @xmath7 , and @xmath8 with order @xmath9 .",

    "in order to get @xmath4 , eve has to perform a password - guessing attack as follows :    she generates a candidate password @xmath22 to decrypt @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and obtains @xmath25 or @xmath26    during this stage , eve can not check whether her candidate session key @xmath27 is correct .",

    "it is well known that @xmath30 has a lower bound : @xmath31 then the time of a discrete logarithm computing cycle @xmath29 will be @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number of quantum gate executed serially in a discrete logarithm algorithm .",
    "it can be seen that the value of @xmath33 depends on the improvement of paralization of quantum discrete logarithm algorithm .",
    "although we can not calculate the exact value of @xmath33 , a rough estimation for a lower bound of @xmath33 is easy , then we have @xmath34 that is , the cycle of a discrete logarithm computation is no less than @xmath35 seconds .",
    "the physical security of a protocol@xmath36}$ ] indicates that the protocol will never be broken by an adversary living in the real physical world .",

    "above analysis is based on some universal parameters of single - qubit quantum gate operations .",
    "now we focus on the analysis of cnot gate of ion - trap quantum computers .",
    "ion - trap quantum computer is proposed by cirac and zoller in 1995@xmath43}$ ] , it is considered one of the most promising scheme of physical implementation of quantum computer . to compute a discrete logarithm meaningful in cryptanalysis , the quantum computer must at least have @xmath44 qubits . in an ion - trap quantum computer ,",
    "the distance between two neighboring qubits is @xmath45 10 @xmath46 m , and the characteristic distance of two qubits executing the cnot operation is about @xmath47 . in an ion - trap ,",

    "for the ion - trap , the dispersion relation of the acoustic waves is @xmath56 where @xmath57 are the frequency and the wavelength of the acoustic wave , respectively , and @xmath58 is the mass of every ion . as @xmath59 ,",
    "equivalent to monochromatic approximation , the dispersion relation can be simplified as @xmath60 then we obtain the velocity of the acoustic waves : @xmath61 let @xmath62 , the velocity will be @xmath63 so the time a cnot operation takes will be greater than @xmath64 in a discrete logarithm computation considered , the number of cnot operations executed serially is @xmath65}$ ] . in view of the fault - tolerant structure of the ion - trap quantum computer , especially the concatenated quantum error - correcting coding related with threshold theorem , we know that @xmath66 then we can infer that the lower bound of time finishing a discrete logarithm computation is @xmath67 that is , during one second , an ion - trap quantum computer can not finish the discrete logarithm computation @xmath68 times , then the attacker can not execute the discrete logarithm computation @xmath69 times in 100 years(@xmath70 seconds ) .",
    "therefore , in 100 years , an eke protocol with a 40-bit password can resist the attacker with several(@xmath42 ) ion - trap quantum computers .",
    "although physical parameters of other kinds of quantum computers are different from that of the ion - trap quantum computer , the conclusion is similar .",
    "let us estimate the length of a password that ensures the physical security of the eke protocol .",
    "suppose the size of a quantum computer is about one meter , then the upper bound of number of the quantum computers employing by any adversary is @xmath71 with all these quantum computers the attacker can run the discrete logarithm algorithm about @xmath72 times within 100 years .",
    "when the length of the password @xmath3 is @xmath73 , the attacker has to call the algorithm for averagely @xmath74 times , this is beyond the attacker s maximal calculating ability .",
    "88 is roughly the number of bits of 11 characters of asc@xmath75 , which is an usual option of a password in nowadays internet .",
