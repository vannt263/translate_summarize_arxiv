    "recently , we have considered the problem of the low energy electronic states in spheroidal fullerenes  @xcite as well as the influence of a weak uniform external magnetic field pointed in the z direction  @xcite .",
    "the main findings were a discovery of fine structure with a specific shift of the electronic levels upwards due to spheroidal deformation and the zeeman splitting of electronic levels due to a weak uniform magnetic field .",
    "in addition , it was shown that the external magnetic field modifies the density of electronic states and does not change the number of zero modes . in this paper , we examine the case of the magnetic field pointed in the x direction .",
    "it is interesting to note that the obtained modification of the electronic spectrum of the spheroidal fullerenes differs markedly from the case of the z - directed magnetic field .",
    "the reason is the proper symmetry of the spheroid , which changes the role of the external magnetic field in comparison with the spherical case .",
    "this gives an additional possibility for experimental study of the electronic structure of deformed fullerene molecules .",
    "notice that the schrdinger equation for a free electron on the surface of a sphere in a uniform magnetic field was formulated and solved to describe zeeman splitting and landau quantization of electrons on a sphere in ref .",
    "we have explored in the ref .  @xcite the field - theory model where the specific structure of carbon lattice , geometry , and the topological defects ( pentagons ) were taken into account . following the euler s theorem one has to insert twelve pentagons into hexagonal network in order to form the closed molecules . in the framework of continuum description",
    "we extend the dirac operator by introducing the dirac monopole field inside the spheroid to simulate the elastic vortices due to twelve pentagonal defects .",
    "the exchange of two different dirac spinors which describes the k spin flux in the presence of a conical singularity is included in a form of thooft - polyakov monopole .",
    "our studies cover slightly elliptically deformed molecules in a weak uniform external magnetic field pointed in the x directions .",
    "spheroidal fullerenes can be considered as an initially flat hexagonal network which has been wrapped into closed monosurface by using of twelve disclinations  @xcite .",
    "we start from the tight - binding model of graphite layer with the trial wave function taken in the form @xmath0 as is seen , the trial function is described by smoothly varying envelope functions @xmath1 multiplying by the bloch functions @xmath2 . within the @xmath3 approximation one",
    "obtains the equations algebraically identical to a two - dimensional dirac equations , where two component wave function @xmath4 represents graphite sublattices @xmath5 and @xmath6 . following the approach developed in  @xcite let us write down the dirac operator for free massless fermions on the riemannian spheroid @xmath7 . the dirac equation on a surface @xmath8 in the presence of the abelian magnetic monopole field @xmath9 and the external magnetic field @xmath10 is written as  @xcite @xmath11\\psi = e\\psi , \\label{eq:1}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the zweibein",
    ", @xmath13 is the metric , the orthonormal frame indices @xmath14 , the coordinate indices @xmath15 , and @xmath16 with @xmath17 \\label{eq:2},\\ ] ] being the spin connection term in the spinor representation ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the energy in ( [ eq:1 ] ) is measured from the fermi level .",
    "the model ( [ eq:2 ] ) allows us to study the structure of electron levels near the fermi energy .",
    "it is convenient to consider this problem by using of the cartesian coordinates @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 in the form @xmath21 the riemannian connection reads ( cf .",
    "( 4 ) ) @xmath22 within the framework of the perturbation scheme the spin connection coefficients are written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 and the terms to first order in @xmath25 are taken into account .",
    "in spheroidal coordinates , the only nonzero component of @xmath9 in region @xmath26 is found to be ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath27 the external magnetic field @xmath6 is chosen to be pointed in the @xmath18 direction , so that @xmath28 .",
    "one obtains @xmath29 @xmath30 the dirac matrices can be chosen to be the pauli matrices , @xmath31 . by using the substitution @xmath32 we obtain the dirac equation for functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the form @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 the square of nonperturbative part of dirac operator takes the form @xmath38 notice that in ( 11)-(13 ) the terms with @xmath39 and @xmath40 were neglected and @xmath41 let us define @xmath42 , where @xmath43 are the eigenfunctions of @xmath44 . in the case of the first energy mode the terms @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 are found to be zero and , therefore , the weak magnetic field pointed in the x direction does not influence the first energy level .",
    "for the second energy mode , only non - diagonal terms @xmath49 , @xmath50 differ from zero with @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "notice that the following wave functions were used for calculations of non - diagonal terms : @xmath53    @xmath54    the low energy electronic spectrum of spheroidal fullerenes in this case takes the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 here @xmath57 are the diagonal matrix elements ( see ref .",
    "table 1 shows contributions to the first and second energy levels for yo - c@xmath58 ( yo means a structure given in @xcite ) .",
    "as is seen , there is a marked difference between the behavior of the first and second energy levels in magnetic field .",
    "indeed , in both cases the energy levels become shifted due to spheroidal deformation .",
    "however , the uniform magnetic field does not influence the first energy level .",
    "the splitting takes place only for the second level .",
    "this is clearly illustrated in fig . 1 and fig.2 , which schematically show the structure of the first and second levels in the uniform magnetic field pointed in x direction .",
    "the case of the z - directed magnetic field is also shown for comparison .",
    "we can conclude that there is a possibility to change the structure of the electronic levels in spheroidal fullerenes by altering the direction of magnetic field",
    ". it would be interesting to test this prediction in experiment .",
    "to gain a better understanding of the difference between the spheroidal and spherical cases , let us consider the angular - momentum operators for dirac operator on the sphere @xmath60 with charge @xmath61 and a total magnetic monopole @xmath62",
    "@xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 here @xmath66 signs correspond to the case of north ( south ) hemisphere , respectively .",
    "these operators satisfy the standard commutations relations of the @xmath59 algebra @xmath67 for zero magnetic field , the square of the dirac operator and @xmath68 may be diagonalized simultaneously @xmath69 for the magnetic field pointed in the z direction , the operator @xmath70 can be expressed in the form @xmath71 while in the case of the magnetic field pointed in the x direction one obtains @xmath72 here @xmath18 and @xmath20 are the cartesian coordinates : @xmath73 . in this case",
    ", the square of the dirac operator and operator @xmath74 may also be diagonalized simultaneously and their eigenvalues are interrelated @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath77 have the form @xmath78 @xmath79 where @xmath80 where @xmath81 are the gamma functions ( see ref .",
    "one can introduce the operators @xmath82 and @xmath83 so that @xmath84 @xmath85 with @xmath86 @xmath87 let us transform these expressions to the cartesian coordinates .",
    "the corresponding transformation rules for spinors are  @xcite @xmath88 and the cartesian realization of operator @xmath89 is @xmath90 with @xmath91 for example , the cartesian realization of @xmath92 takes the form @xmath93 for @xmath94 it may be written in the well - known form @xmath95",
    "we have studied the influence of the uniform magnetic field on the energy levels of spheroidal fullerenes . the case of the x - directed magnetic field was considered and compared with the case of the z - th direction .",
    "the z axis is defined as the rotational axis of the spheroid with maximal symmetry .",
    "the most important finding is that the splitting of the electronic levels depends on the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "our consideration was based on the using of the eigenfunctions of the dirac operator on the spheroid , which are also the eigenfunction of @xmath96 .",
    "let us discuss this important point in more detail .",
    "in the case of a sphere there is no preferable direction in the absence of the magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field sets a vector , so that the z - axis can be oriented along the field . in this case",
    ", one has to use such eigenfunctions of the dirac operator which are also the eigenfunctions of @xmath96 . for the x - directed magnetic field",
    ", the eigenfunction of both the dirac operator and @xmath92 must be used .",
    "evidently , the same results will be obtained in both cases .",
    "the situation differs markedly for a spheroid .",
    "the spheroidal symmetry itself assumes the preferential direction which can be chosen as the z - axis . in other words ,",
    "the external magnetic field does not define the preferable orientation .",
    "the symmetry is already broken and , as a result , the case of the magnetic field pointed in the @xmath18 direction differs from the case of the @xmath20-directed field .",
    "for instance , there are no eigenfunctions which would be simultaneously the eigenfunctions of both the dirac operator on the spheroid and @xmath92 . for this reason , the structure of the electronic levels is found to crucially depend on the direction of the external magnetic field .    0.2 cm 0.2 cm the work was supported in part by vega grant 2/7056/27 . of the slovak academy of sciences , by the science and technology assistance agency under contract",
