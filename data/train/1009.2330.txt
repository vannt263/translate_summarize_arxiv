    "the positive contributions for @xmath80 are given by @xmath81 namely , @xmath82 terms , where @xmath83 appear with multiplicity two .",
    "let us begin by chasing all terms @xmath84 .",
    "the first negative term will cancel all terms like @xmath85 and @xmath86 , so one eliminates all terms with @xmath87 or @xmath88 .",

    "some of these terms are included in @xmath103 , and we are now concerned only with the terms @xmath104 and @xmath105 . on the same way , but with @xmath106 , @xmath107 with @xmath108 goes away , leaving @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 .",
    "the first of these terms goes with @xmath112 , the last goes with @xmath113 , while the remaining reduces to @xmath114 , due to @xmath115 , which is finally canceled by @xmath112 .",
    "now we can follow a similar strategy for the terms @xmath116 .",
    "starting from @xmath117 , which eliminates all terms with @xmath101 or @xmath107 , and @xmath118 , which eliminates @xmath108 and @xmath119 , we are left with @xmath120 .",
    "the term @xmath121 , with @xmath100 , reduces the task to @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "the same term , with @xmath106 , reduces even more to @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 .",
    "the two first terms are eliminated by @xmath128 , while @xmath129 reduces the order two to @xmath130 , and @xmath131 .",

    "we close the demonstration by proving that they also appear ( at least ) twice in the negative contributions .",

    "so we have @xmath160 noncontextual states contributing for @xmath161 . but",
    "note that six of these states have @xmath138 , and the other three have @xmath146 , so once again all terms which add for the positive part also appear in the negative one .",
    "as probabilities are non - negative , the resulting inequality applies .",
    "to see that inequality is tight , just use state @xmath162 , while @xmath163 is a realistic contextual state ( in the sense that it is an assignment of values which does not obey the assumption of noncontextuality ) which violates it .        _",
    "proof._it is again necessary to cancel out the same nine terms which contribute to @xmath161 .",
    "four of them have @xmath95 and @xmath138 .",
    "also four of them have @xmath96 and @xmath146 , but one was taken twice .",
    "the remaining two terms are canceled by the second summation term , since one has @xmath165 and the other @xmath166 .",
    "_ quantum violation._now let us discuss in more details how the quantum violation of the presented inequalities is directly related to the first example discussed in the letter .",
    "for this , we will focus on the inequality @xmath169 since every term is conditioned to @xmath77 , we can consider a projective measurement on part @xmath32 with the result corresponding to @xmath170 appearing .",

    "<S> introduction_contextuality is a fascinating property of nature : the result of an experiment may depend on other compatible experiments that may be performed . </S>",
    "<S> this is surprising because the experiment gives the same result when repeated after any number of compatible experiments . </S>",
    "<S> it is also surprising because the probability of obtaining any particular result does not depend on which compatible experiments might be performed ( probabilities are noncontextual ) . </S>",
    "<S> nature s </S>",
    "<S> contextuality was pointed out by the discovery that some predictions of quantum mechanics ( qm ) can not be reproduced by any noncontextual theory , and that this conflict occurs for any state of any system with three or more distinguishable states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> quantum contextuality has far - reaching consequences , such as the impossibility of describing nature by classical theories with bounded speed of information @xcite or bounded density of memory @xcite , or the possibility of device - independent eternally secure communications @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the original demonstration by kochen and specker ( ks ) @xcite is usually considered a _ tour de force _ because it is based on a @xmath0-vertex graph . however , this graph has an @xmath1-vertex building block , which we refer to as the basic diagram ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ ksblock ] ) . in a ks graph , each vertex is seen as a yes or no proposition and linked vertices are compatible propositions where no more than one of them can be assigned the yes answer ( a property sometimes called exclusiveness ) . </S>",
    "<S> the original @xmath0-vertex graph was built to give a state - independent proof of the impossibility of assigning noncontextual answers reproducing the predictions of quantum mechanics for a three - level system ( like a spin @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , a triangle represents a set of three compatible propositions , one of them receiving the yes answer ( given quantum mechanically by a projective complete measurement , like the @xmath3 component of a spin 1 particle ) . </S>",
    "<S> the basic building block is also referred to as a yes - no diagram , in the sense that if the answer yes is noncontextually assigned to vertex @xmath4 , any valid assignment must give to the vertex @xmath5 the value no . </S>",
    "<S> this letter was motivated by this basic diagram , as we will show below .    in 1999 , a debate on the physical impact and experimental testability of the kochen - specker theorem started in the pages of physical review letters . </S>",
    "<S> meyer @xcite and kent @xcite pointed out that finite precision measurement nullifies the physical content of the kochen - specker theorem . </S>",
    "<S> more than 20 papers have been published since then supporting ( for instance , @xcite ) or criticizing ( for instance , @xcite ) this conclusion . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , a series of experimental tests with ions @xcite , neutrons @xcite , photons @xcite , and nuclear magnetic resonance systems @xcite have been questioned due to a variant of the objection of meyer and kent called the compatibility loophole @xcite .    in this letter we present a proposal for a type of experiment that ( we hope ) will definitely close the debate on the physical relevance and experimental testability of the kochen - specker theorem and stimulate a new generation of experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> since it is impossible to have contextuality for a two - level system , subjected to projective measurements , the three - state quantum system , or qutrit , is considered the simplest example of contextuality . </S>",
    "<S> we give here a state - dependent quantum contextuality demonstration @xcite with a twofold objective : to provide a clear example for the nonspecialized reader and to fix notation to be used in the two - qutrit case . </S>",
    "<S> suppose the qutrit is initially in the state @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are three orthogonal states . </S>",
    "<S> then the measurement represented by the projector @xmath10 , with @xmath11 gives the result @xmath2 ( representing `` yes '' ) , with ( quantum mechanical ) probability @xmath12 this already establishes the _ yes - yes _ possibility and we need only to prove the existence of the six other vertices obeying all compatibility and exclusiveness properties of the ks basic building block . for this , consider the observable @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are the following orthogonal states :    [ h0 ] @xmath17    then , according to qm , the result @xmath18 can never be obtained since @xmath19 . in addition , in any noncontextual theory in agreement with qm , the result of @xmath20 can not be @xmath21 since @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in any noncontextual theory in agreement with qm , the initial state @xmath23 together with the positive probability imply @xmath24 , whenever the yes answer should be found for @xmath25 . consider also @xmath26 where    [ h1 ] @xmath27    the same reasoning leads to the conclusion that , in any noncontextual theory in agreement with qm , @xmath28 whenever @xmath5 is to happen .    </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath24 and @xmath28 can not happen simultaneously since @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , there is no noncontextual assignment of results to the six propositions @xmath30 in agreement with the predictions of qm for a qutrit prepared in the state @xmath23 and postselected in the state @xmath25 . indeed , the orthogonality relations between these eight states constitutes the building block of the kochen - specker proof @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these eight quantum states obey all orthogonality conditions represented on the building block diagram ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ksblock ] ) , but the nonorthogonality of @xmath23 and @xmath25 allows for a yes - yes answer , ruled out by noncontextual assignments .     building block of the kochen - specker proof of quantum contextuality ( left ) . </S>",
    "<S> vertices represent propositions ; two of them are joined when the propositions are compatible and both can not be true . </S>",

    "<S> then the previous argument vanishes . </S>",

    "<S> [ ksblock ] can not be constructed if the unit vectors are restricted to vectors with rational components @xcite or to a set where each vector participates only of one context @xcite , although in both cases these sets are dense in the set of unit vectors and therefore are undistinguishable from the set of all unit vectors by experiments with finite precision @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a related problem affecting some recent experimental violations @xcite of noncontextual inequalities @xcite involving sequential measurements on the same physical system is the fact that these inequalities are based on the assumption that the sequential measurements are perfectly compatible , something which does not occur in actual experiments , so to conclude contextuality extra assumptions are needed @xcite .    here </S>",
    "<S> we avoid these extra assumptions by measuring one of the observables in one qutrit and the second observable on a distant qutrit . </S>",
    "<S> spatial separation provides a physical basis to the assumption that both measurements are not only approximately but perfectly compatible . the combination of state - independent kochen - specker proofs and correlated systems is a standard way to show contextuality and nonlocality for composite systems @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , instead , we do not require a state - independent proof . </S>",
    "<S> our central result will be to adapt the previous one - qutrit example to find two - qutrit quantum violations for noncontextual inequalities derived under the same inspiration .    for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> we start by deriving an inequality valid for any realistic theory ( i.e. , those assigning predefined answers for all possible questions ) based on the observables of the block of kochen and specker and involving correlations between measurements on two different parties @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    </S>",

    "<S> a detailed calculation is given in the supplemental material [ suppmat ] .    </S>",
    "<S> notice that , despite the fact that the inequality is inspired by the ks diagram applied to a pair of three - level systems in a singlet state , as will be made clear by eqs . , it is independent of it in the sense that the proof is not based on a diagram , and even a computer programmed to search for realistic inequalities could have found it .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also important to stress that inequality also holds for any local theory . </S>",
    "<S> this means that , when the choice of measurement in one of the particles is spacelike separated from the result of the measurement on the other particle , then is a ks inspired bell inequality .    in translating the ks basic diagram into four realistic questions , exclusiveness of each triangle </S>",
    "<S> was used , but the noncontextual assumption deserves more . for each part , we also have the following logical implications :    [ compat ] @xmath53    a noncontextual assignment is given by answers to the four questions following the conditions . only @xmath54 out of the @xmath55 realistic states are noncontextual . with fewer allowed states , more restrictions can be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> one can now prove the following .    _ lemma 2._consider @xmath33 and @xmath35 as in lemma 1 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , consider that these questions obey , for each party , conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the following inequality holds : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is used to remind that only noncontextual hidden - variable states are taken into account .    _ </S>",
    "<S> proof._again , it is simple bookkeeping showing that all terms which contribute to the positive term also appear at ( at least one ) negative ones . </S>",
    "<S> details and other inequalities are provided in the supplemental material @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> inequalities are tight , with respect to noncontextual states , and can be violated by realistic states which do not obey some of the relations . in this sense , </S>",
    "<S> even with an experiment prepared with spacelike separations between @xmath31 and @xmath32 , they should not be considered as bell inequalities . </S>",
    "<S> their violation rules out a different set of hidden - variable models : noncontextual ones . from the technical point of view , that is a great advantage , since an experimentalist need not bother with guaranteeing spatial - like separations .    with the same kind of proof one can deduce the following .    </S>",
    "<S> _ lemma 3._with the same conditions of lemma 2 , @xmath58 and also other similar expressions . </S>",
    "<S> again , is tight with respect to noncontextual states , and can be violated with realistic contextual ones .    _ </S>",
    "<S> quantum violation._the same quantum system will violate all inequalities shown here . </S>",
    "<S> it is just a two particle generalization of the previous described state - dependent proof of impossibility of noncontextual models for quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> consider a two - qutrit system prepared in the state @xmath59 and the observables    [ qmoperators ] @xmath60    with @xmath23 , @xmath25 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 as defined in eqs , , , and . </S>",
    "<S> then the predictions of qm are @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and the remaining probabilities in are null . </S>",

    "<S> is done , its validity rests only on hidden - variable hypothesis of a preexisting reality which is reveled by measurements . </S>",
    "<S> inequalities and are based on these four questions and on the constraints given by noncontextual hypothesis . because the lemmas were written and proved </S>",
    "<S> , there is no necessity of going back to the diagrams , despite the fact that their essence is captured by those relations .    in all these inequalities , </S>",
    "<S> each term involves pairs of compatible questions , asked for different parts of the composed system . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , being a quantitative statement , the argument is not sensible to finite precision problems , given that precision is enough to make violations meaningful . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> those are proposals for quantum violations of noncontextuality free from compatibility and finite precision loopholes .    testing the violation of inequality is very demanding experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> it requires testing @xmath69 joint probabilities and , assuming that one obtains @xmath70 and @xmath71 for the other @xmath72 probabilities , one must have @xmath73 in order to observe a violation of inequality . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of this result is that it explicitly shows that there is no fundamental obstacle observing kochen - specker contextuality on ( pairs of ) qutrits . </S>",
    "<S> no additional assumptions are needed to deal with the fact that measurements have a finite precision and compatibility between sequential measurements is not perfect .    </S>",
    "<S> inequalities are less demanding experimentally . indeed </S>",
    "<S> , they can be translated as conditional probabilities giving inequalities like @xmath74 which gives larger violations , since qm predicts @xmath75 , allowing for @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> another interesting point is that inequality only involves one question and one answer in part @xmath32 : @xmath77 , and an experiment would only involve three possible measurements in part @xmath31 , with coincidence countings of each of these three with one and the same condition in @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> it is also stressed in the supplementary material @xcite how much this situation resembles the first example discussed in this letter .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we have established experimentally testable contextual inequalities , based on the building block of kochen - specker demonstration of the impossibility of assigning noncontextual answers to all possible predictions of quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> we hope that this proposal will definitely close the debate on the physical relevance and experimental testability of the kochen - specker theorem , and induce a new generation of loophole - free experiments .    </S>",
