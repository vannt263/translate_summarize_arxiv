    "over the last two decades , there is an increasing interest on properties of hadrons under extreme conditions @xcite . according to these investigations , two theoretical aspects ,",
    "namely theoretical studies of hadrons at finite temperature and density as well as a careful analysis of the heavy ion collision results are important .",
    "calculation of hadronic parameters at finite temperature and density directly from qcd is a difficult problem .",
    "the thermal qcd is successful theory in the large momentum transfer region , where the quark - gluon running coupling constant is small and one can reliably use perturbative approaches . however , at the hadronic scale , this coupling constant becomes large and perturbation theories fail .",
    "hence , investigation of hadronic properties requires some nonperturbative approaches .",
    "some nonperturbative approaches are lattice qcd , heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) , different quark models and qcd sum rules . among these approaches ,",
    "the qcd sum rule method @xcite and its extension to the finite temperature @xcite has been extensively used as an efficient tool to hadron physics @xcite . the same as qcd sum rules in vacuum",
    ", the main idea in thermal qcd sum rules also is to relate the hadronic parameters with the qcd degrees of freedom . in this method ,",
    "an appreciate thermal correlator is expressed in terms of interpolating currents of participating particles . from one side , this correlation function is evaluated saturating it by a tower of hadrons with the same quantum numbers as the interpolating currents . on the other hand , it is calculated via the operator product expansion ( ope ) in terms of operators having different mass dimensions .",
    "matching these two different representations of the same correlation function provides us a possibility to predict hadronic properties in terms of finite - temperature perturbation theory and long - distance nonperturbative physics including the thermal quark and gluon condensates as well as thermal average of energy density .    comparing to the qcd sum rules in vacuum , the thermal qcd sum rules have several new features .",
    "one of them is to take into account the interaction of the currents with the existing particles in the medium .",
    "such interactions require modification of the hadronic spectral function .",
    "the other aspect is breakdown of lorentz invariance by the choice of reference frame . due to residual @xmath4 symmetry at finite temperature ,",
    "more operators with the same dimensions appear in the ope compared to those at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "the thermal qcd sum rule method has been extensively used to study the thermal properties of light @xcite , heavy - light @xcite and heavy - heavy @xcite mesons as a reliable and well - established method .",
    "the discussion of heavy mesons properties at zero temperature has a rather long history @xcite .",
    "the heavy mesons play very important role in our understanding of nonperturbative dynamics of qcd .",
    "first determinations of leptonic decay constant of pseudoscalar , @xmath0 meson at zero temperature were made twenty years ago @xcite .",
    "such charged meson decays play important role to extract the magnitudes and phases of the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa(ckm ) matrix elements , which can help us understand the origins of cp violation in and beyond the standard model . our aim in this work is to investigate the temperature dependence of mass and leptonic decay constants of the pseudoscalar @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons taking into account the additional operators arising at finite temperature .",
    "the pseudoscalar decay constant , @xmath5 is defined by vacuum to meson matrix element of the axial vector current as :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 or @xmath8 and @xmath9 or @xmath10 . in thermal field theories , the meson mass , @xmath11 and its decay constant , @xmath5 should be replaced by their temperature dependent versions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we obtain thermal qcd sum rules for the masses and decay constants of the considered pseudoscalar mesons calculating the spectral densities and nonperturbative corrections . in section 3",
    ", we present our numerical calculations and discussions .",
    "taking into account the new aspects of the finite temperature qcd , sum rules for the masses and decay constants of the heavy pseudoscalar mesons containing @xmath8 and/or @xmath13 quark are derived in this section .",
    "the starting point is to consider the following responsible two - point thermal correlation function : @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the temperature , @xmath16 is the time ordering product and @xmath17 is the interpolating current of the heavy pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the thermal average of the operator , @xmath18 appearing in the above correlation function is expressed as : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the qcd hamiltonian , @xmath21 is inverse of the temperature @xmath15 and traces are performed over any complete set of states .",
    "as we previously mentioned , to obtain sum rules for physical observables , we need to calculate the aforementioned correlation function in two different ways . in qcd or theoretical side ,",
    "the correlation function is calculated in deep euclidean region , @xmath22 via ope where the short or perturbative and long distance or nonperturbative contributions are separated , @xmath23 the perturbative contribution is calculated using perturbation theory , whereas the nonperturbative contributions are expressed in terms of the thermal expectation values of the quark and gluon condensates as well as thermal average of the energy density . the perturbative part can be written in terms of a dispersion integral , hence @xmath24 where , @xmath25 is called the spectral density at finite temperature .",
    "the thermal spectral density at fixed @xmath26 is written as : @xmath27 in order to calculate the @xmath28 in the lowest order in perturbation theory , we use quark propagator at finite temperature @xcite as : @xmath29 where @xmath30^{-1}$ ] is the fermi distribution function . using the above propagator , after some calculations we find the imaginary part of the correlation function as : @xmath31 where , @xmath32 \\delta(q_0-\\omega_1-\\omega_2 ) \\nonumber\\\\ & - & \\big[\\big(1-n_1(\\omega_1)\\big)n_2(\\omega_2)+\\big(1-n_2(\\omega_2)\\big)n_1(\\omega_1)\\big]\\delta(q_0-\\omega_1+\\omega_2)\\big\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "as it is seen , the @xmath35 involves two pieces . the first term , which includes delta function @xmath36 survives at zero temperature and",
    "is called the annihilation term .",
    "the second term , which includes delta function @xmath37 is called scattering term and vanishes at @xmath38 . the delta function , @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn8 ] ) gives the first branch cut , @xmath39 , which coincides with zero temperature cut that describes the standard threshold for particle decays . on the other hand , the delta function , @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn8 ] ) shows that an additional branch cut arise at finite temperature , @xmath40 , which corresponds to particle absorption from the medium .",
    "taking into account these contributions , the annihilation and scattering parts of spectral density in the case , @xmath41 can be written as :    @xmath42,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for @xmath43 , and @xmath44,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath45 with @xmath46 . here",

    "to calculate the nonperturbative part in qcd side , we use the nonperturbative part of the quark propagator in an external gluon field , @xmath59 in the fock - schwinger gauge , @xmath60 . taking into account one and two gluon lines attached to the quark line",

    "<S> we investigate the mass and decay constant of the heavy - heavy pseudoscalar , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons in the framework of finite temperature qcd sum rules . </S>",
    "<S> the annihilation and scattering parts of spectral density are calculated in the lowest order of perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the additional operators arising at finite temperature , the nonperturbative corrections are also evaluated . </S>",
    "<S> the masses and decay constants remain unchanged under @xmath3 , but after this point , they start to diminish with increasing the temperature . at critical or deconfinement temperature , the decay constants reach approximately to 38% of their values in the vacuum , while the masses are decreased about 5% , 10% and 2% for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 states , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the results at zero temperature are in a good consistency with the existing experimental values as well as predictions of the other nonperturbative approaches . </S>"
