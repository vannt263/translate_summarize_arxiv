    "target or event detection / tracking has been one of the main applications of wireless sensor networks . while most of the previous work has been on static sensor networks , recently it has been shown that the coverage of a sensor network can be improved via mobility @xcite . in case of monitoring",
    "geographically inaccessible or dangerous areas , mobile robots equipped with sensors can be deployed for effective coverage . moreover , if the target ( event ) to be detected by the sensor network is of time - critical nature , the coverage of the network should be sufficiently high to be able to respond to the detected event in a timely manner ; such as wildfire monitoring or liveliness detection under rubble in case of an earthquake , where the emergency personnel work against the clock . to this end",
    ", in this paper , we propose a coverage - based cooperative mobility model for wireless sensor networks to detect and track ( monitor ) targets without prior knowledge of the physical topology and by using only local topology information . while determining the mobility path , no assumption is made on the application the sensor network is deployed for .",
    "empirical studies are conducted to test the performance of the proposed model , where a stationary target ( such as a live body under rubble ) or a mobile target ( such as animals monitored in their habitat ) is assumed to occur at a random location in the geographical area to be monitored and target detection probability and tracking ( monitoring ) efficiency performance of the proposed model is compared with legacy mobility models such as random walk , random direction , etc .",
    "it is shown that the coverage - based mobility model consistently results in a better performance than the other mobility models .",
    "in addition , we also provide a brief analysis to determine the minimum number of nodes required to achieve a certain target coverage , for the stationary target scenario .",
    "results show that while for small detection probabilities all mobility models perform similarly , for higher desired detection probabilities coverage - based mobility model significantly outperforms the rest in terms of the number of required mobile nodes .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section ii background on mobility models and coverage problem in wireless sensor networks",
    "is summarized .",
    "the proposed coverage - based mobility model is presented in section iii .",
    "a brief detection analysis is provided in section iv .",
    "results are given in section v and the paper is concluded in section vi .",
    "the system under investigation is a wireless sensor network that consists of only mobile nodes with the same transmission range .",
    "the system parameters are summarized in table  [ syspar ] .",
    "there are several mobility models that consider independent or dependent movement among mobile nodes @xcite . in this paper , the following well - known mobility models are considered :    @xmath0 _ random walk _ : a mobile node picks a random speed and direction from pre - defined uniform distributions either at fixed time intervals or after a certain fixed distance is traveled .",
    "the current speed and direction of the mobile node do not depend on the previous speeds and directions .",
    "@xmath0 _ random direction _ : a random direction drawn from a uniform distribution is assigned to a mobile node and the mobile node travels in that direction till it reaches the boundary of the simulation area .",
    "once it reaches the boundary , it pauses there for a fixed amount of time , then moves along the new randomly selected direction . in this paper , for fair comparison , we assume that the pause time is zero .",
    "@xmath0 _ parallel - path _ : a mobile node picks a random speed and sweeps the geographical area from border to border following a direction parallel to the boundary line .    the models explained above are memoryless , i.e. , the current directions are independent of the past directions and the mobile nodes decide their movements independently from each other .",
    "there are several other mobility models that take into account the dependence on the mobility pattern of other nodes in the network @xcite , social relationships of the mobile nodes @xcite , or topographical information @xcite , etc . in this work , initially , the models explained above are studied in addition to the proposed mobility model in section iii .",
    "note that while in the above models ( and the proposed model presented in the next section ) the speeds are drawn from a probability distribution , in the monte carlo simulations conducted in this paper we assume that the mobile nodes have a fixed speed .",
    "coverage problem in wireless sensor networks is of great importance and has been investigated by several researchers . in static wireless sensor networks , in general , coverage problem is treated as a node - activation and scheduling problem @xcite-@xcite .",
    "more specifically , algorithms are proposed to determine which sensor nodes should be active such that an optimization criterion is satisfied .",
    "the criterion can for instance be achieving a certain event detection probability , or covering each point in the area by at least @xmath1 sensors , etc .",
    "in addition , there are also studies that take into account not only the event ( or network ) coverage , but the connectivity of the wireless sensor network as well @xcite .",
    "while deciding which sensor nodes should be active at a given point in time , coverage and connectivity requirements are met .",
    "recently , mobile sensor networks have been under investigation and it has been shown that mobility , while complicates the design of higher layer algorithms , also can improve the network , for instance , in terms of capacity , coverage , etc .",
    "@xcite-@xcite optimum mobility patterns for certain applications are proposed , such as mobile target tracking , chemical detection , etc .",
    "using both ground and aerial vehicles .",
    "mobile robots with swarming capability operate cooperatively and aim to achieve a global goal have also been considered @xcite-@xcite .    in robotics ,",
    "several mobility models have been developed . in many of these models",
    "the robots which are too close repel each other to avoid collisions but to maintain communication they attract each other when they are separated more than certain distance .",
    "gas expansion model @xcite , for example , mimics the way gas particles are spread to vacuum when they are allowed to expand .",
    "this model , again , uses the attraction and repulsion forces between the robots to maximize the dispersion while maintaining the communication .",
    "similar models have also been proposed by using an artificial force or potential fields for the robots to cooperatively move @xcite .",
    "however , the focus in these studies is maximizing the spread not the coverage , and they are based on the assumption that the robots have high computing capacities .    in this work , without assuming any predetermined application , we propose a collaborative mobility model based on only local information to improve area coverage in wireless sensor networks with low computation - capability nodes .",

    "in this section , we propose a mobility model that makes use of the local physical topology information .",
    "the objective is to improve coverage of a geographical area for a given mobile sensor network .",
    "while designing the model , the application is not predetermined .",
    "more specifically , only the physical information is used to determine the mobility path .",
    "the performance of the algorithm will be tested for an event detection / monitoring application later in the paper .",
    "we assume that there is no prior knowledge of the location of the mobile nodes .",
    "since the objective is to improve coverage , it is desirable to reduce the overlap between the covered areas by different mobile nodes and use the limited number of mobile nodes efficiently ( specifically , if the mobile sensor network will be used for a time - critical application . ) .    in the model ,",
    "the speed of the mobile nodes is a uniform random variable in @xmath2 $ ] and the direction is chosen in fixed time intervals according to the local topology at the time of the decision .",
    "more specifically , we assume that there is a force between mobile nodes that causes them to _ repel _ each other .",
    "the magnitude of the force that each node applies to others is inversely proportional to the distance between the nodes , i.e. , the closer the nodes get the stronger they _ push _ each other .",
    "we also assume that the mobile node knows its current direction and a force with a magnitude inversely proportional to the node s transmission range ( i.e. , @xmath3 ) is applied to it in the direction of movement to avoid retracing the already covered areas by the mobile node . at the time of direction change",
    ", each mobile node computes the _ resultant _ force vector acting on them by themselves and their neighbors ( i.e. , the mobile nodes within their transmission range ) and move in the direction of the resultant vector . the forces at the time of decision are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cbforce ] , where mobile node 1 is moving toward right in the previous step .",
    "while the distance between the mobile nodes can easily be determined if the nodes are equipped with gps , due to cost limitations it might be more feasible to use the received signal strength jointly with the direction of signal arrival to estimate the distance .",
    "further work is necessary to determine a power and cost efficient method to estimate the distances between mobile nodes .",
