    "communication networks are rapidly evolving towards a model in which the constituting components ( e.g. , routers and links ) are activated and maintained by different owners , which one can imagine as players sitting on the network nodes .",
    "when these players act in a selfish way with the final intent of creating a connected network , the challenge is exactly to understand whether the pursuit of individual profit is compatible with the attainment of an equilibrium status for the system ( i.e. , a status in which players are not willing to move from ) , and how the social utility for the system as a whole is affected by the selfish behavior of the players .",
    "this task , which involves both computational and economical issues of the system , is exactly the aim of a research line which started with the seminal paper of fabrikant _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , where the by now classic _ network creation game _ ( ncg ) was initially formalized and investigated .",
    "[ [ definition - of - the - ncg . ] ] definition of the ncg .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in its original formulation , the ncg is defined as follows : we are given a set of @xmath0 players , say @xmath11 , where the strategy space of player @xmath12 is the power set @xmath13 .",
    "given a combination of strategies @xmath14 , let @xmath15 denote the underlying undirected graph whose node set is @xmath11 , and whose edge set is @xmath16 .",
    "then , the _ cost _ incurred by player @xmath17 under @xmath18 is    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the distance between nodes @xmath21 and @xmath17 in @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the cost function implements the inherently antagonistic goals of a player , which on the one hand attempts to buy as little edges as possible , and on the other hand aims to be as close as possible to the other nodes in the outcoming network .",
    "these two criteria are suitably balanced in ( [ cost ] ) by making use of the parameter @xmath22 .",
    "consequently , the _ _ nash equilibria _ _ ( ne ) space of the game is heavily influenced by @xmath23 , and the corresponding characterization must be given as a function of it .",
    "the state - of - the - art for the _ price of anarchy _ ( poa ) of the game , that we will call henceforth sumncg , is summarized in @xcite , where the most recent progresses on the problem have been reported .",
    "[ [ further - ncg - models . ] ] further ncg models .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    a criticism made to the classic ncg model is that the parameter @xmath23 is in a sense exogenous to the system .",
    "moreover , usage and building cost are summed up together in the player s cost , and this mixing is reflected in the social cost of the resulting network . as a consequence , we have that in this game the poa alone does not say so much about the structural properties of the network , such as density , diameter , or routing cost .",
    "this gave rise to a sequence of new ncg models .",
    "a first natural variant of sumncg was introduced in @xcite , where the authors redefined the player cost function as follows    @xmath24    this variant , named maxncg , received further attention in @xcite , where the authors improved the poa of the game on the whole range of values of @xmath23 .",
    "however , maxncg still incorporates in its definition the parameter @xmath23 . in an effort of defining new parameter - free models , in @xcite the authors proposed an interesting variant in which a player @xmath17",
    ", when forming the network , has a limited _ budget _ @xmath25 to establish links to other players .",
    "this way , the player cost function restricts to the usage cost , namely either the maximum or the total distance to other nodes .",
    "in particular , in @xcite the authors focused on the latter measure .",
    "for this _ bounded - budget _ version of the game , that we call sumbb , they showed that determining the existence of ne is -hard . on a positive side",
    ", they proved that for uniform budgets , say @xmath26 , sumbb always admits a ne , and that its _ price of stability _",
    "( pos ) is 1 , while its poa is @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "notice that in sumbb , links are seen as directed .",
    "thus , a natural extension of the model was given in @xcite , were the undirected case was considered . for this , it was proven that both maxbb and sumbb always admit a ne .",
    "moreover , the authors showed that the poa for maxbb and sumbb is @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , while in the special case in which the budget is equal to 1 for all the players , the poa is @xmath31 for both versions of the game .",
    "in all the above models it must be noticed that , as stated in @xcite , for a player it is -hard to find a best response once that the other players strategies are fixed . to circumvent this problem ,",
    "in @xcite the authors proposed a further variant , called _ basic ncg _ ( bncg ) , in which given some existing network , the only improving transformations allowed are _ edge swaps _ , i.e. , a player can only modify a _",
    "incident edge , by either replacing it with a new incident edge , or by removing it .",
    "this naturally induces a weaker concept of equilibrium for which a best response of a player can be computed in polynomial time . in this setting ,",
    "the authors were able to give , among other results , an upper bound of @xmath30 for the poa of sumbncg , and a lower bound of @xmath8 for the poa of maxbncg .",
    "however , as pointed out in @xcite , the fact that now an edge has not a specific owner , prevents the possibility to establish any implications on the poa of the classic ncg , since a ne in a bncg is not necessarily a ne of a ncg .    finally , another ncg model",
    "which is barely related to the ncg model we study in this paper has been addressed in @xcite .",
    "[ [ our - results . ] ] our results .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + +    in this paper , we propose a new ncg variant that complements the model proposed in @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we assume that the cost function of each player only consists of the number of bought edges ( without any budget on them ) , but with the additional constraint that a player @xmath17 needs to connect to the network by staying within a given ( either _ maximum _ or _ average _ ) _ distance _ , say ( either @xmath32 or @xmath33 ) , to the set of players .",
    "our model is motivated by the fact that in a realistic scenario , a player might have a strong objective about its centrality in the created network , and this can only be guaranteed by means of our approach .",
    "for this bounded - distance version of the ncg , we address the problem of understanding the structure of the ne associated with the two variants of the game , that we denote by maxbd and sumbd . to this respect , we first show that both games can have an unbounded poa as soon as players hold at least two different distance bounds .",
    "moreover , in both games , computing a best response for a player is -hard .",
    "these bad news are counterbalanced by the positive result we get for _ uniform _ distance bounds . in this case , first of all , the pos for maxbd is equal to 1 , while for sumbd is at most equal to 2 .",
    "then , as far as the poa is concerned , let @xmath1 and @xmath34 denote the uniform bound on the maximum and the average distance , respectively .",
    "we show that    1 .   for maxbd ,",
    "the poa is lower and upper bounded by @xmath2 and @xmath3 for @xmath4 , while for @xmath7 is @xmath8 and @xmath9 ; thus , the poa is constant as soon as @xmath35 , for some @xmath6 ; 2 .   for sumbd ,",

    "we developed a systematic study on the poa of the two ( uniform ) games maxbd and sumbd , which , however , needs to be continued , since a significant gap between the corresponding lower and upper bounds is still open .",

    "actually , in an effort of reducing such a gap , we focused on maxbd , and we observed the following fact : recall that a graph is said to be _ self - centered _ if every node is a center of the graph ( thus , the eccentricity of every node is equal to the radius of the graph , which then coincides with the diameter of the graph ) . an interesting consequence of lemma [ lm : poa le gamma ] is that only stable graphs that are self - centered can be dense , as one can infer from the following        thus , to improve the lower bound for maxbd , one has to look to self - centered graphs .",

    "starting from these observations , we investigated the possibility to use small and suitably dense self - centered graphs as _ gadgets _ to build lower bound instances for increasing values of @xmath1 . to illustrate the process , see figure [ fig : pallone ] ,",
    "where using a self - centered cubic graph of diameter 3 and size 20 , we have been able to obtain a lower bound of 3 ( it is not very hard to see that the obtained graph is in equilibrium ) .    interestingly enough , the gadget is a famous extremal ( i.e. , maximal w.r.t .",
    "node addition ) graph arising from the study of the _ degree - diameter _",
    "problem , namely the problem of finding a largest size graph having a fixed maximum degree and diameter ( for a comprehensive overview of the problem , we refer the reader to @xcite ) .",
    "more precisely , the gadget is a graph of largest possible size having maximum degree @xmath486 and diameter @xmath487 .",
    "in fact , this seems not to be coincidental , since also _ moore graphs _",

    "<S> a _ network creation game _ simulates a decentralized and non - cooperative building of a communication network . informally , there are @xmath0 players sitting on the network nodes , which attempt to establish a reciprocal communication by activating , incurring a certain cost , any of their incident links . </S>",
    "<S> the goal of each player is to have all the other nodes as close as possible in the resulting network , while buying as few links as possible . according to this intuition , any model of the game </S>",
    "<S> must then appropriately address a balance between these two conflicting objectives . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by the fact that a player might have a strong requirement about its centrality in the network , in this paper we introduce a new setting in which if a player maintains its ( either _ maximum _ or _ </S>",
    "<S> average _ ) distance to the other nodes within a given associated _ bound _ , then its cost is simply equal to the _ number _ of activated edges , otherwise its cost is unbounded . </S>",
    "<S> we study the problem of understanding the structure of associated pure nash equilibria of the resulting games , that we call maxbd and sumbd , respectively . for both games , we show that computing the best response of a player is an -hard problem . </S>",
    "<S> next , we show that when distance bounds associated with players are _ non - uniform _ , then equilibria can be arbitrarily bad . on the other hand , for maxbd , we show that when nodes have a _ uniform _ bound @xmath1 on the maximum distance , then the _ price of anarchy _ ( poa ) is lower and upper bounded by @xmath2 and @xmath3 for @xmath4 ( i.e. , the poa is constant as soon as the bound on the maximum distance is @xmath5 , for some @xmath6 ) , while for the interesting case @xmath7 , we are able to prove that the poa is @xmath8 and @xmath9 . for the uniform sumbd we obtain similar ( asymptotically ) results , and </S>",
    "<S> moreover we show that the poa becomes constant as soon as the bound on the average distance is @xmath10 .    </S>",
