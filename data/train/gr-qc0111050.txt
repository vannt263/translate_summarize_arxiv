    "the first generation of long - baseline laser interferometers and ultra cryogenic bar detectors will start collecting data very soon .",
    "the network of detectors is expected not only to confirm the existence of gravitational waves ( gw ) but will also provide the information about the structure and the dynamics of its source . at the present stage , the data analysis depends largely upon the study of the expected characteristic of its potential sources and the waveforms .",
    "majority of the experimental searches is focused on the detection of burst and _ chirp _ signals . however , the interest in the data analysis for continuous gravitational wave ( cgw ) signals is growing .",
    "a prime example of sources of this type is a spinning neutron star .",
    "many research groups around the globe are working extensively on the data analysis for spinning neutron stars ( jaranwoski , et.al 1998 , 1999 , 2000 ; brady et .",
    "1998 , 2000 ; krlak 1999 ) . +    the detection of gw signals in the noisy output of the detectors has its own problems , not the least of which is the sheer volume of data analysis .",
    "bar detectors have essentially the same problems as interferometers in reference to cgw sources .",
    "each detector produces a single data stream that may contain many kinds of signals .",
    "detectors do nt point , but rather sweep their broad quadrupolar beam pattern across the sky as the earth moves .",
    "so possible sources could be anywhere on the sky and accordingly the data analysis algorithms need to accommodate signals from any arbitrary location of its source .",
    "+    in this and the subsequent paper we present analysis of fourier transform ( ft ) of the output data of a ground based laser interferometer .",
    "the output data has broad band noise and the signal is to be extracted out of it . for this",
    ", one has to enhance signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "this is achieved by analyzing long observation time data as snr is directly proportional to the square root of observation time ( @xmath0 ) . however , in a data for long duration , the monochromatic signal gets doppler modulated due to ( i ) the orbital motions of the earth around the sun and ( ii ) the spin of the earth .",
    "the frequency modulation ( fm ) will spread the signal in a very large number of bins depending on the source location and the frequency .",
    "in addition to this , there is amplitude modulation ( am ) . as we will see in the sequel the amplitude of the detector output consists of simple harmonic terms with frequencies @xmath1 and @xmath2 where , @xmath1 stands for angular rotational frequency of the earth .",
    "accordingly , the am results in splitting of the ft into frequencies @xmath3 and @xmath4 . +    in the next section we present the noise free response of the laser interferometric detector and obtain the explicit beam pattern functions . in section 3",
    "we discuss the doppler effect and obtain fourier transform ( ft ) of the fm signal for arbitrary source and detector locations taking into account the earth s rotational motion about its axis and its revolution around the sun . in section 4",
    "the ft of the doppler modulated complete response of the detector is obtained .",
    "section 5 is the conclusion of the paper .",
    "let a plane gw fall on a laser interferometer and produce changes in the arms of the detector . in order to express these changes quantitatively",
    "we have to specify the wave and the detector .",
    "let @xmath5 and @xmath6 represent respective frames characterising the wave and the detector .",

    "the matrix @xmath13 represents the transformation expressing the rotations to bring the wave frame @xmath14 to the detector frame @xmath15 .",
    "the direction of the source may be expressed in any of the coordinates employed in spherical astronomy .",
    "however , we find it convenient to define it in solar system barycentre ( ssb ) frame , @xmath16 .",
    "this ssb frame is nothing but astronomer s ecliptic coordinate system .",
    "let @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the celestial colatitude and celestial longitude of the source .",
    "these coordinates are related to the right ascension , @xmath19 and the declination , @xmath20 of the source via    @xmath21    where @xmath22 represents obliquity of the ecliptic .",
    "we choose @xmath23 axis as the bisector of the angle between the arms of the detector . at this stage",
    "the orientation of the detector in the horizontal plane is arbitrary .",
    "it is assigned with the help of the angle @xmath24 which the @xmath23 axis makes with the local meridian .",
    "the location of the detector on the earth is characterised by the angles , @xmath25 - colatitude and @xmath26 - the local sidereal time , expressed in radians .",
    "the transformation matrix @xmath27 may be expressed as    @xmath28    where    @xmath29 rotation required to bring @xmath5 to @xmath30 + @xmath31 rotation required to bring @xmath30 to @xmath32 + @xmath33 rotation required to bring @xmath32 to @xmath6 + here",
