    "dwarf galaxies are currently the most abundant galaxy population and were probably even more abundant during the first epochs of the universe .",
    "thus , they are crucial to the understanding of galaxy formation and evolution . elemental abundance ratios and their variation within galaxy lifetime due to star formation are among the most important constraints to chemical evolution models ( e.g. , @xcite ) . because of that , optical spectroscopy of emission - line gas in galaxies is essential to understand their chemical evolution history .",
    "local universe dwarf galaxies are an ideal environment for studying these aspects . however , owing to their intrinsic faintness , observational constraints to their evolution , such as the chemical abundances of stellar populations of different ages , can be obtained only for very nearby galaxies in the local group ( lg ) .",
    "this paper is part of an ongoing project aimed at deriving the chemical abundances of a significant sample of lg galaxies using emission - line objects , like planetary nebulae ( pne ) , which are present from early- to late - type galaxies .",
    "similar analysis were already published by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , pea , stasiska & richer ( 2007 ) , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "ngc  185 , together with ngc  205 , ngc  147 , and ngc  221 , is one of the brightest dwarf companions of m31 .",
    "it is similar to ngc  147 in terms of mass and luminosity , but its content of gas and dust is much more significant . using a four - colour photometry to analyse the stellar content of ngc  185 , @xcite concluded that its metallicity is [ fe / h]@xmath2 . following the arguments of @xcite and @xcite , while ngc  147 and ngc  185 are very similar in terms of their stellar content , star formation history and absolute luminosity , their metallicities are different . from the pn photometry , @xcite found that the pne in ngc  185 are systematically brighter than those in ngc  147 . in their detailed photometric study of ngc  185 ,",
    "martnez - delgado , aparicio & gallart ( 1999 ) found a significant star formation , in the inner region , during the last few gyr ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this is specifically so within an elliptical isophote of semi - major axis of  240 arcsec , where all the 5 brightest pne of 185  are located .",
    "prior to the present work , these 5 bright pne were spectroscopically studied by richer & mccall ( 1995 , 2008 ) . from the pn photometry",
    ", @xcite suggested that the brighter pne in the inner regions of ngc  185 might be the product of stars formed in the last few gyr , while the absence of such bright pne in ngc  147 would be the consequence of the absence of such relatively young stellar population .",
    "our deep spectroscopic observations of ngc  185 were aimed at studying its fainter pn population and its diffuse interstellar medium ( ism , also discussed by gallagher , hunter & mould 1984 ; @xcite and @xcite ) in the regions where the star formation is probably still active .",
    "it turns out that we actually can summarise our study as follows : _",
    "i ) _ we detected three new faint pne in ngc  185 , _",
    "ii ) _ we discovered the first symbiotic star of the galaxy , and _",
    "iii ) _ we described for the first time the properties of the supernova remnant @xcite , associated with the arc - like diffuse nebula , and located at the centre of this galaxy .",
    "section 2 describes the observations and reduction process . in section 3",
    "we present and interpret our spectroscopic results , in terms of pn extinction , densities , temperatures and chemical abundances , also including abundance patterns and the ngc  185 chemical evolution suggested by its pn population .",
    "the characteristics of the supernova remnant and its possible relation with the ongoing star formation at the centre of ngc  185 is discussed in section 4 .",

    "following hodge ( 1963 ) the baade s stars are young ob stars , while according to the colour - magnitude diagram of martnez - delgado et al .",
    "( 1999 ) these stars lie in a region where evolved stars of about 40 - 150 myr are expected .",

    "we argue that the bright pne in ngc  185 have ages between 0.2 and 1.8 gyr , and so represent young to intermediate - age populations . in addition , by comparing the age and metallicity of the pne with those of the old stellar population of the galaxy we are able to conclude that ngc  185 has suffered a significant chemical enrichment within the last @xmath1  8 gyr .",

    "following the fact that ngc  185 syst-1 also possesses the broad emission feature at 6830 , and does not show forbidden lines in its spectrum , an s - type symbiotic class is suggested for this star .    and last , but not least , for the first time we present the physical characteristics of the ngc  185 snr-1 ( probably the same reported by @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , we discuss the very interesting possibility of witnessing the induction of star formation by a supernova explosion .",
    "indeed , the connection of the snr-1 with the recent star formation in ngc  185 is strongly suggested by the presence of a number of relatively young stars that are all located around the ngc  185 snr-1 !",
