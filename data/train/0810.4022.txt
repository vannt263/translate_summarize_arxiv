    "current observations @xcite ( cosmic microwave background , type ia supernovae , baryon acoustic oscillation , integrated sachs - wolfe effect correlations , etc . ) show that our universe is accelerating , which suggest the existence of a spatially homogeneous and gravitationally repulsive energy component referred as dark energy .",
    "the simplest dark energy candidate is the cosmological constant @xmath4 stemming from energy density of the vacuum , which corresponds to a fluid with a constant equation of state @xmath5 .",
    "but the theoretical value of vacuum energy density is much larger than the observed @xcite .",
    "so , various scalar - field dark energy models @xcite are presented , such as quintessence ( @xmath6 ) , phantom ( @xmath7 ) , etc .. however , these dynamical dark energy candidates lack a concrete motivation from fundamental physics . therefore , the subject of dark energy is still an attractive topic .    on the other hand , the phase transition in the early universe could have produced different kinds of topological defects , whose cosmological implications are very important @xcite .",
    "the global monopole , which has divergent mass in flat space - time , is one of the most interesting defects .",
    "when one considers gravity , the linearly divergent mass of the global monopole has an effect analogous to that of a deficit solid angle plus a tiny mass at the origin .",
    "it has been shown that this effective mass is actually negative @xcite . however , this monopole become a black hole with a deficit solid angle ( global monopole black hole ) when it is swallowed by an ordinary black hole @xcite .",
    "recently , black holes enveloped by the quintessence field have been widely investigated .",
    "kiselev @xcite provided a new black hole solution using einstein equations with static spherically - symmetric quintessence - like matter .",
    "then , quasinormal modes of this kind of black hole have been studied @xcite , which are believed by some physicists to be a unique fringerprint in directly identifying the existence of a black hole . in this paper",
    ", we show the solution of black hole with quintessence - like matter and a deficit solid angle , and study its qnms by wkb method @xcite .",
    "the numerical results show both the real part and the imaginary part of the quasinormal frequencies for scalar and gravitational perturbations decrease as the state parameter @xmath0 ; oscillating frequencies and damping frequencies of scalar and gravitational fields increase with the deficit solid angel parameter @xmath1 decreasing and density of static spherically - symmetric quintessence - like matter @xmath2 decreasing , respectively .",
    "we shall work within a particular model in unit @xmath8 , where a global @xmath9 symmetry is broken down to @xmath10 .",
    "the lagrangian density is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is triplet of scalar fields , isovector index @xmath13 .",
    "the hedgehog configuration describing a global monopole is @xmath14 so that we shall actually have a monopole solution if @xmath15 at spatial infinity and @xmath16 near the origin .",
    "the general static metric with spherical symmetry can be written as @xmath17 the solutions for a global monopole surrounded by the static spherically - symmetric quintessence - like matter are as follows @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a dimensionless parameter of a deficit solid angle , a dimensionless @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "when such a global monopole is swallowed by an ordinary black hole with mass m , a black hole with quintessence - like matter and a deficit solid angle can be formed @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23(__m__@xmath24 ) is the dimensionless parameter of global monopole black hole mass surrounded by quintessence - like matter .",
    "now , we consider concretely the behaviors of scalar and gravitational perturbations in a black hole with quintessence - like matter and a deficit solid angle , respectively .",
    "the propagation of a massless scalar field is described by the klein - gordon equation @xmath25 then we separate variables by setting @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the usual spherical harmonics . submitting eq.(7 ) to ( 6 ) , we obtain @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the tortoise coordinate @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the effective potential @xmath32 , \\end{split}\\ ] ]    for gravitational perturbations , the metric function is expressed as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the background metric , and @xmath35 is a small perturbation . here , we adopt the canonical form for @xmath35 in classical regge - wheeler gauge @xcite @xmath36 introducing @xmath37 , we obtain @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the effective potential @xmath40 , \\end{split}\\ ] ]",
    "here , we make use of the third - order wkb method to numerical calculation .",
    "the qnms is as follows @xmath41-i(n+\\frac{1}{2})(-2v_{0}^{''})^\\frac{1}{2}(1+\\omega),\\ ] ] where @xmath42 and @xmath43       our numerical results of qnms for scalar and gravitational perturbations are listed in tables 1 - 5 and tables 6 - 8 , respectively . as a reminder ,",
    "the oscillating quasi - period and the damping time scale are shown in these tables . in table 1 , we fixed @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and the complex quasinormal frequencies vary with the state parameter @xmath0",
    ". obviously , the real parts of the quasinormal frequencies decrease with @xmath0 , which means the larger the value of @xmath0 is , more quickly the global monopole black hole surrounded by quintessence - like matter oscillates . and the magnitude of imaginary part decreases as the absolute value of @xmath0 increases , corresponding to the case more slowly oscillation of quintessence - like matter surrounding global monopole black hole decays , smaller the state parameter @xmath0 is .",
    "this behavior is different from that in ref.@xcite , in which it was found that the perturbation damps quicker with the increase of the absolute value of the equation of state of quintessence .",
    "the difference may be caused by variation of the second - order derivative of the effective potential at its maximum value with @xmath0 as shown in fig .",
    "1 . in table 2 , we chose @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath47 , and listed quasinormal frequencies of global monopole black hole .",
    "comparing table 2 with table 1 , we find that quasi - period of the oscillation and the imaginary part of quasinormal frequencies in table 2 are smaller than that in table 1 .",
    "in other words , oscillation of global monopole black hole decays more slowly in quintessence - like matter case . in table 3",
    ", we consider the quasinormal frequencies vary with different @xmath2 ( density of static spherically - symmetric quintessence - like matter at @xmath3 ) fixing @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath48 and @xmath47 .",
    "the oscillating frequency and the damping frequency both increase when @xmath2 decreases . in table 4 , we show how the qnms behave for various deficit solid angels in @xmath48 , @xmath44 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 case .",
    "it is clear that the real part of the quasinormal frequencies increases when @xmath1 decreases .",
    "however , the imaginary part decreases as @xmath1 .",
    "it is interesting to note that when @xmath1 small enough , the real part of quasinormal frequencies in table 4 is very close to that of ordinary black hole with quintessence - like matter in table 5 ( parameters of this black hole @xmath49 , and @xmath50 are same as those in table 4 ) .",
    "however , the damping time scales of black hole with a deficit solid angle ( in table 4 ) are larger than that of black hole without deficit solid angle ( in table 5 ) .    for gravitational perturbations ,",
    "we study variations of quasinormal frequencies via different @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 , respectively , as showed in tables 6 - 8 . in table 6",
    ", we choose @xmath44 , @xmath51 , @xmath45 and @xmath52 , and the complex quasinormal frequencies vary with @xmath0 .",
    "the real parts of quasinormal frequencies decrease with the decrease of @xmath0 , but the imaginary parts increase .",
    "this conclusion is similar to that in ref.@xcite , which means the gravitational perturbations damps more slowly in quintessence - like matter case . in table 7",
    ", we considered the relation between quasinormal modes and the parameter @xmath2 with @xmath44 , @xmath48 , @xmath45 and @xmath52 .",
    "evidently , the oscillating quasi - period and damping time scale both decrease as @xmath2 . in table 8",
    ", we show the real parts and the magnitude of the imaginary parts of quasinormal frequencies both increase as @xmath53 decrease . to sum up",
    ", the variations of quasinormal frequency with @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 for gravitational field are similar to those for scalar field .",
