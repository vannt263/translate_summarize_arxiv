    "ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( uligs ) are the most luminous objects in the local universe ( their bolometric luminosities @xmath3 ) .",
    "the uligs are undergoing major dissipative collapses , which are probably triggered by mergers ( clements et al .",
    "1996 ; murphy et al .  1996 ) .",
    "whether the uligs are powered by starbursts or active galactic nuclei ( agn ) has remained unknown since their discovery because of huge amounts of internal extinction along our lines of sight to their centres ( for a review see sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "however , recent mid - infrared spectroscopic work ( genzel et al .  1998 ) suggests that the major energy sources of most local uligs are nuclear starbursts .",
    "this provides an important motivation for studying the star formation in the centres of uligs in detail .",
    "the nearest and best - studied ulig is the star - forming ( genzel et al .",
    "1998 ) galaxy arp 220 ( far - infrared luminosity @xmath4 ) at a distance of 74 mpc ( assuming @xmath5 = 75 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 and @xmath7 ; de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "detailed imaging of the centre of arp 220 with the _ hubble space telescope _ has revealed a number of super star clusters ( sscs ; shaya et al .",
    "1994 , scoville et al .",
    "these nuclear sscs appear to be a generic feature of luminous merging galaxies ( lutz 1991 ; ashman & zepf 1992 ; holtzman et al .",
    "1992 ; zepf & ashman 1993 ; surace et al .  1998 ; surace & sanders 1999 ) .",
    "surace et al . (",
    "1998 ) and surace & sanders ( 1999 ) evaluated the luminosities of sscs in warm uligs and concluded that the combined contributions of the all the individual detected circumnuclear sscs to the bolometric luminosities are small .",
    "they also showed that for some warm uligs the de - reddened luminosities of putative nuclei are not able to account for the bolometric luminosity and that a large fraction of the bolometric luminosity must arise from sources undetected at both optical and near - infrared wavelengths .    in this paper , we compare the observed optical and near - infrared spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the arp 220 sscs with the starburst99 model seds of leitherer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and estimate their ages , masses , and luminosities , along with the internal extinction along our lines of sight to them .",
    "this is the first attempt to analyse by sed fitting methods the properties of sscs in the centre of arp 220 , which is colder ( sanders et al .",
    "1988 ) than the uligs studied by surace et al .",
    "these results will let us evaluate how much of the very substantial amount of star formation currently happening in arp 220 is in the sscs , at least in the ones which are not completely invisible at optical and near - infrared wavelengths due to internal extinction .",
    "recently , soifer et al . ( 1999 ) presented the images of arp 220 from 3.45 to 24.5 @xmath8 m . since genzel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) derived the value of @xmath9 mag based on the mid - infrared hydrogen recombination lines ( br@xmath10 @xmath11 2.17 @xmath8 m , br@xmath12 @xmath11 4.05@xmath8 m and pf@xmath12 @xmath11 7.46 @xmath8 m ) , the mid - infrared sources observed by soifer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) must be highly obscured objects .",
    "this suggests that what surace et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found to be true in the warm uligs , specifically that the contribution of the observed clusters to the bolometric luminosity is small , is also true in arp 220 .",
    "we now investigate this in detail by studying the energy outputs of the sscs themselves .",
    "the _ hubble space telescope _ images of the core of arp 220 show eleven sscs at optical ( @xmath13- , @xmath14- , and @xmath15-band ) wavelengths ( shaya et al .",
    "1994 ) and twelve sscs at near - infrared ( @xmath16- , @xmath17- , and @xmath18-band ) wavelengths ( scoville et al .",
    "1998 ) . in this paper",
    ", we call the f110w filter ( 1.1 @xmath8 m ) as @xmath16 filter , though the standard @xmath16 filter is at 1.25@xmath8 m .",
    "we combine these datasets in order to obtain a set of sscs that are detected at all wavelengths .",
    "this allows us to sample the seds over as wide a range in wavelength as possible .",
    "three sscs are located in the outer regions of the core  we expect dust extinction to be smallest here , so that these sscs should be seen at all wavelengths . given the published coordinates , there is a slight offset between the near - infrared and optical positions of these sscs ( see the left panel of figure 1 ) . however , if we rotate the near - infrared images by @xmath19 around the nuclear ssc associated with the western nucleus , the positions of the star clusters in the two images are almost coincident ( see the right panel of figure 1 ) .",
    "given the probable low extinction along these lines of sight , we regard this astrometrical solution as likely to be the correct one . in addition , given this astrometry , we then find that three nuclear sscs ( hereafter n1 , n2 , and n3 ) are coincident in the optical and near - infrared images , in addition to the three circumnuclear ones ( hereafter c1 , c2 , and c3 ) .      in figure 2 , we show the observed seds of the six sscs .",
    "we use the photometric data published by shaya et al .",
    "( 1994 ; @xmath20 bands ) and by scoville et al .",
    "( 1998 ; @xmath21 bands ) for ssc n2  n3 and c1  c3 . in the case of ssc n1",
    ", we have used @xmath22 archival data to measure the optical fluxes using the same 0.92 arcsec @xmath23 0.58 arcsec aperture used by scoville et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for the near - infrared measurements ( shaya et al .  used a smaller aperture in their analysis ) .",
    "the magnitudes of ssc n1 are 21.96 mag and 19.36 for @xmath14-band ( f702w ) and @xmath15-band ( f785lp ) respectively .",
    "this ssc was not detected in the @xmath13-band ( f555w ) .",
    "all three nuclear sscs show a peak at 1.6 @xmath8 m , whereas all three circumnuclear sscs have seds that rise towards bluer wavelengths .",
    "this is a very important difference and is immediately suggestive of far more dust extinction along the lines of sight to the nuclear sscs than along the lines of sight to the circumnuclear ones .",
    "we now compare the seds with the starburst99 spectral synthesis models of leitherer et al .",
    "one of the advantages of the starburst99 is that it tell us the evolution of the strength of co index which is useful to constrain the range of ages .",
    "when fitting model seds to observed ones in the presence of internal extinction , there are several parameters that we need to consider : 1 ) the mode of star formation .",
    "for example , the star formation may occur continuously ( the constant star formation , or csf model ) , may occur in a short , almost instantaneous , burst ( the instantaneous starburst , or isb model ) , or may occur in a way that varies with time in a complex manner .",
    "for the blue circumnuclear sscs , there is no evidence that star formation has been ongoing in these isolated clusters for any considerable time , and we adopt an isb model for describing star formation in these systems . on the other hand , the nuclear star - forming regions of arp 220 are probably at least 10@xmath24 years old ( mouri & taniguchi 1992 ; prestwich , joseph , & wright 1994 ; armus et al .",
    "1995 ; larkin et al .",
    "yet there still appear to be ionizing sources in the nuclear region ( larkin et al .",
    "1995 , kim et al .",
    "1995 , and goldader et al .  1995 ) .",
    "therefore an isb model will not work here , and we approximate star formation in the nuclear sscs by a csf model . on the other hand , there is a possibility that the nuclear sscs are not the ongoing starburst discussed in the above papers but post - starburst and we also consider an isb model for the nuclear sscs , although we regard the csf one as the more likely ; 2 ) the stellar imf .",
    "we adopt a salpeter imf with an upper mass cutoff of @xmath25 and a lower mass cutoff of @xmath26 .",
    "we note that @xmath27 might be larger in a violent star - forming region ( see e.g.  goldader et al .",
    "1997 ) and investigate the effect of the imf on our results in the next section ; 3 ) the initial gas metallicity .",
    "we assume solar metallicity ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "since the metallicity of galactic centre may be larger than the solar value , we also study the case of @xmath29 ( see the next section ) ; 4 ) the age at which we observe the star clusters .",
    "we leave this as a free parameter in the range of @xmath30 yr to @xmath31 yr ; 5 ) the effect of extinction .",
    "the total extinction can be regarded as the sum of two parts : 1 ) extinction from dust in arp 220 along our line of sight to the sscs , and 2 ) extinction from dust _ within _ the sscs .",
    "the relative importance of these two regimes can be tested as follows .",
    "a screen model may be used to describe extinction along our line of sight to the sscs , and the  onion - skin \" model of surace and sanders ( 1999 ) may be used to quantify the extinction from dust within the sscs .",
    "this comparison is made in appendix a , where we show that ( 1 ) is the more important regime .",
    "we consequently adopt a screen model and leave the absolute value @xmath32 of the extinction in the @xmath13-band as a free parameter to be fit to the data , but impose the constraint that the extinction must vary with wavelength according to the extinction curve of cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) ; 6 ) nebular emission .",
    "starburst99 includes the nebular continuum emission which is proportional to the flux of ionizing photons .",
    "if all of the lyman continuum photons are used to ionize the surrounding gas , the equivalent width of h@xmath12 can reach 1000   and the @xmath14-band flux becomes twice as large as that from the continuum .",
    "however , the _ measured _ equivalent width of the h@xmath12 emission line in arp 220 is only 20  30 (armus et al .",
    "1989 , veilleux et al .",
    "if the equivalent width of h@xmath12 emission of each ssc is the same as the total ones , the contribution of emission lines to the broadband photometry is then negligibly small .",
    "we neglect it here ; 7 ) dust emission .",
    "hot dust emission was required to interpret a @xmath18-band flux excess in previous studies ( surace & sanders 1999 for warm uligs ; mazzarella et al .",
    "1992 for the nuclei of arp 220 ) . however , there is little @xmath18-band flux excess for our sample .",
    "we ignore the hot dust emission in our models .",
    "using maximum likelihood techniques , we determine the best - fitting model seds to the observed ones for the six sscs . the likelihood is defined as @xmath33 ^ 2 \\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the observed flux , the template flux , and the uncertainty of the observed flux of @xmath37-th band .",
    "the uncertainty of the photometry we adopted is @xmath38 mag for shaya et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and @xmath39 mag for scoville et al .",
    "a scale factor @xmath40 is obtained as @xmath41 from the condition of @xmath42 .",
    "the results are summarized in table  1 and the seds of best - fitting models are presented in figure 2 .",
    "figure 3 is a summary of the region of plausible parameters in the @xmath32 - age plane for the nuclear sscs .",
    "the results for the csf model are shown in figure 3 ( a ) - ( c ) and those for the isb model are shown in figure 3 ( d ) - ( f ) .    the hatched region is the region of plausible parameters at the 99 % confidence level .",
    "we immediately see that the extinction @xmath32 along our lines of sight to the nuclear sscs is very large ( @xmath43 mag ) .",
    "these values are slightly larger than those evaluated by shaya et al .",
    "( 1994 ) while slightly smaller than those of scoville et al .",
    "these differences can be attributed to the extinction curves adopted in the analyses [ shaya et al .",
    "use the extinction curve of savage & mathis ( 1979 ) , while scoville et al .",
    "use that of rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) ] .    on the other hand , it is difficult to determine the age of sscs , due to strong parameter coupling with the extinction .",
    "a small change in @xmath32 mimics a substantial change in age in the sense that both shift the sed towards redder wavelengths .",
    "we explain the rough shapes of the relevant parameter space as follows",
    ". if the stellar populations are very young ( age @xmath44 yr ) , @xmath32 must be very large , since the intrinsic slope of the continuum is very blue and a great deal of extinction is required to make it as red as is observed . for stellar populations older than several @xmath45 yr , the allowed values of @xmath32 do not vary strongly with age since the slope of continuum does not vary with the age of the stars . at the age of @xmath46 yr in the isb model , the plausible value of @xmath32 becomes small temporarily due to the presence of a large number of red supergiants at exactly this age .    therefore , we can not determine the ages of the nuclear sscs this way .",
    "we must use additional measurements .",
    "for n1 , there exists an independent constraint on the mass of the ssc from radio and millimetre observations .",
    "the mass of n1 as determined by the sed fit represents a locus of points in the @xmath32-age plane , and is shown in figure 3 ( the dashed line ) .",
    "the position of n1 corresponds to the western nucleus observed to exhibit radio continuum , 1.3 mm dust continuum and the co ( 1 - 0 ) and ( 2 - 1 ) lines ( scoville et al .",
    "1997 ; downes & solomon 1998 ; sakamoto et al . 1999 ) .",
    "millimetre spectroscopy ( of co lines ) can be used to determine both a dynamical mass ( from the line widths ) and a molecular gas mass ( from the line luminosities ) . from the results of downes & solomon ( 1998 ) and",
    "sakamoto et al .  ( 1999 ) , we estimate a dynamical mass of this nucleus of @xmath47 and a gas mass of @xmath48 [ adopting the inclination parameter of scoville et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ] .",
    "the mass of the stellar component must be less than the difference between these two masses , which is @xmath48 .",
    "if there are other ( highly obscured ) stellar components present within the region , this number is an upper limit ; if all the mass of n1 is in gas and observed stars , then this is an equality .",
    "the dashed lines in figure  3 ( a ) and ( d ) show the locus of sscs with the mass of @xmath49 .",
    "the region of plausible parameters is now restricted to that to the left of the lines .",
    "the upper limits on the age of n1 are now @xmath50 yr for the csf model and @xmath51 yr for the isb model .",
    "the reason why we can set an upper limit of age is that the luminosity - to - mass ratio of the stellar cluster becomes smaller as it gets older and consequently a more massive cluster is required to radiate the observed flux .",
    "the dynamical masses of n2 and n3 have not been measured .",
    "although the eastern nucleus of arp 220 has been detected in co , the position of it corresponds to neither n2 nor n3 .",
    "instead it is an entirely different object ( hereafter we call it as n4 ) , coincident with the nuclear source se in the near - infrared images of scoville et al .",
    "based on the fact that n1 and n4 only exhibit non - thermal radio continuum , thermal dust continuum , and molecular gas , scoville et al .",
    "( 1998 ) suggested that these two objects represent the most substantial mass concentrations in the centre of arp 220 .",
    "we now consider yet another way to constrain the range of ages of the nuclear sscs .",
    "the strength of co absorption index at 2.29 @xmath8 m constrains the ages since it is sensitive primarily to the presence of red k supergiants , which are stars with a narrow age distribution , particularly in the isb models .",
    "the co index of the centre of arp 220 is known to be strong : @xmath52 mag ( goldader et al .",
    "1995 ) , @xmath53 mag ( shier et al .",
    "1996 ) , and @xmath54 mag [ armus et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for the central @xmath55 arcsec@xmath56 .",
    "although the co indices of each ssc are not individually observed , if we assume that all three nuclear sscs have a co index larger than 0.20 mag , then we get following additional constraint on the ages : @xmath57 for the isb model , or @xmath58 for the csf model . in the case of the isb model ,",
    "the co index is 0 mag until the age of @xmath59 yr and become strong rapidly at later times , reaching 0.2 mag at the age of @xmath60 yr , which corresponds to the main - sequence lifetime of the stars with mass of 25 @xmath61 , the main progenitors of the k supergiants .",
    "after that , the co index decreases gradually and becomes smaller than 0.2 mag at @xmath62 yr .",
    "in the case of the csf model , since newly formed red supergiants keep the co index strong , the co index continues to be larger than 0.2 mag for a longer time than for the isb model .",
    "the strength of the co index is modified slightly by dust as follows .",
    "since the continuum level is determined on the blue side of co band , dust extinction has the effect of causing us to underestimate the continuum and therefore to underestimate the co index . ignoring dust emission at 2.3 microns",
    "has the same effect since the sed of the dust component is rising towards longer wavelengths .",
    "if the intrinsic value of co index is larger than we think , then the upper limit of the age of sscs become smaller . ignoring the effects of dust",
    "therefore does not invalidate the upper limits we present .",
    "rieke et al .",
    "( 1985 ) reported that the equivalent width of h@xmath10 absorption within the central 2.5 arcsec of arp 220 is 4  .",
    "this value of the balmer absorption is incompatible with such a strong co index for single stellar cluster .",
    "probably this discrepancy arises because the balmer feature originates from old foreground ( possibly progenitor galaxy ) stars that happen to lie at low optical depth and are quite unrelated to the sscs .",
    "the flux of the nuclear region of arp 220 at very blue wavelengths is therefore likely to be dominated by foreground stars at low skin - depth .",
    "recall that the nuclear sscs were not observed in the @xmath13-band so the extinction at these short wavelengths is probably quite high .",
    "we can now estimate the maximum bolometric luminosity emitted from the nuclear star clusters from the above results .",
    "for the isb model , the maximum bolometric luminosities of n1 , n2 , n3 are @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the sum of these luminosities is @xmath66 which is about one - tenth of the bolometric luminosity of arp 220 ( @xmath67 , sanders et al .",
    "1988 ) . for the csf model , the maximum bolometric luminosities of n1 , n2 , n3 are @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the sum of these is @xmath71 which is about one - fifth of the bolometric luminosity of arp 220 .",
    "we can therefore state with some confidence that if most of the total bolometric luminosity of arp 220 arises from the nucleus , more than four - fifths of it arises from highly obscured starbursts ( or possibly an agn ) .",
    "the results depend on the imf as follows",
    ". a steeper imf decreases the implied ages of the star clusters .",
    "for example , imf with ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 ) decreases the maximum ages derived from the stellar mass ( @xmath75 ) to @xmath76 yr for the csf model or @xmath77 yr for the isb model . on the other hand , a truncated imf increases the ages .",
    "for example , an imf with ( @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath74 ) increases the upper limits on the ages to @xmath80 yr for the csf model and @xmath81 yr for the isb model .",
    "the evolution of co index also depends on the imf , since the number of red supergiants per unit total stellar mass at any time is a function of the imf .",
    "if we adopt the steeper imf as above , the range of ages when the co index is larger than 0.2 mag is @xmath82 for the csf model or @xmath83 for isb model . for the truncated imf , it is @xmath84 for the csf model or @xmath57 for the isb model .",
    "the bolometric luminosity emitted from the nuclear star clusters also depends on the imf , since we have imposed a constraint on the mass .",
    "the bolometric luminosity ranges between @xmath71 ( csf model with standard imf ) and @xmath85 ( isb model with steeper imf ) ; the basic conclusions are unchanged .",
    "the metallicities of many luminous elliptical galaxies ( the probable fate of ultraluminous galaxies like arp 220 ) are often considerably higher than solar ( faber 1973 ) .",
    "it is therefore important to investigate how the results change if the metallicity is increased to twice solar ( section 3.1 , p.10 ) , comparable to the values in the most luminous ellipticals ( faber 1973 ) . for the sed fitting , the larger",
    "metallicity causes only a very small change , but the length of time when the co index is strong is considerably longer .",
    "the range of ages when the co index is larger than 0.2 mag is @xmath86 for the csf model or @xmath87 for the isb model .",
    "the maximum bolometric luminosities are @xmath88 for csf model and @xmath63 for isb model ; the basic conclusions are also unchanged .",
    "it is also useful to estimate how much of the difference between the total bolometric luminosities and the luminosities of the observed sscs can be made up if one includes the contribution from n4 , the se nucleus seen in the near - infrared but not the optical images . from sed fitting , we derive a value of @xmath89 mag ( figure  4 ) , much smaller than the value of @xmath90 mag evaluated by scoville et al .",
    "this discrepancy comes from the fact that we use all three of the @xmath16- , @xmath17- , and @xmath18- band fluxes for sed fitting , whereas scoville et al .",
    "use only the @xmath91 colour .",
    "if , as for n1 , we assume that the maximal mass of n4 is the dynamical mass minus the gas mass , and assume that the strength of the co index is greater than 0.2 mag , we derive a maximum intrinsic luminosity of n4 of @xmath92 for isb model or @xmath93 for csf model .",
    "adding these values to the summation of the bolometric luminosities of n1 - n3 , we derive a maximum bolometric luminosity emitted from the nuclear sscs of @xmath94 for the isb model and @xmath95 for the csf model .",
    "these values are still much smaller than the total bolometric luminosity of arp 220 .",
    "again , this result is essentially not affected by the imf or metallicity .",
    "therefore the conclusion that most of the bolometric luminosity we see originating from the nucleus of arp 220 comes from heavily obscured star formation seems unavoidable . at optical and near - infrared wavelengths",
    "we see only a small fraction ( less than one - fifth ) of it .",
    "the fact that the total luminosity of observed sources can not account for the bolometric luminosity is similar to those derived for the putative nuclei of warm uligs ( surace & sanders 1999 ) .",
    "figures  3 ( g ) - ( i ) summarize the allowed regions on the @xmath32 - age plane for the circumnuclear sscs .",
    "the data require total extinctions of @xmath96 mag , far less than for the nuclear sscs .",
    "because of this low extinction , the cluster ages , masses , and luminosities are much better constrained by the sed fits than for the nuclear clusters .",
    "we find that the upper limits on the ages of the sscs are @xmath97 yr , @xmath98 yr , and @xmath99 yr for c1 , c2 and c3 .",
    "these results are very different from those of scoville et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who suggests that they may be as old as ( @xmath100 years ) the central globular clusters of ngc 5128 ( frogel 1984 ) , because of the similarity of near - infrared colours .",
    "we attribute this slight redness of the star clusters to a little amount of dust rather than to a very large age .",
    "we also mention that since the near - infrared colours of star clusters mainly depend on the colours of red supergiants and red giants , the evolution of near - infrared colours is small for the age larger than @xmath46 yr . on the other hand , the optical colours , which mainly determined by the colours of the upper main sequence stars , evolve gradually from blue to red for the hubble time .",
    "it is therefore useful to use the optical colours to determine the age of sscs .",
    "we summarize the best - fitting parameters for the circumnuclear sscs in table  1 .",
    "the masses of the sscs are about @xmath101 , similar to the masses of galactic globular clusters .",
    "maybe these are the globular clusters hypothesized to form during mergers by zepf & ashman ( 1993 ) , who note that elliptical galaxies ( thought to be merger remnants ) have higher specific globular cluster frequencies than spiral galaxies ( thought to be merger progenitors ) , and that the metallicity distributions of the globular clusters in the ellipticals are bimodal .",
    "the luminosities of the sscs are about @xmath102 .",
    "therefore c1 - 3 contribute negligibly to the total bolometric luminosity of arp 220 .",
    "this result is unchanged if we consider the other circumnuclear sscs which are detected only at near - infrared wavelengths .",

    "<S> we investigate the photometric properties of six super stellar clusters ( sscs ) seen in both the optical and near - infrared hubble space telescope images of the local ultraluminous starburst galaxy arp 220 . </S>",
    "<S> three of the sscs are located in the central 0.5 kpc region . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining three are in the circumnuclear region between 0.5 kpc and 2.5 kpc from the centre . comparing the observed spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the sscs with the starburst99 models of leitherer et al . </S>",
    "<S> , we confirm that all the three nuclear sscs are heavily obscured ( @xmath0 mag ) . </S>",
    "<S> considering the results from this comparison in conjunction with measurements of the near - infrared co absorption index and of millimetre co line widths and luminosities , we estimate the ages of the nuclear sscs to be @xmath1 yrs . </S>",
    "<S> the bolometric luminosity of the three nuclear sscs is at most one - fifth of the total bolometric luminosity of arp 220 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the circumnuclear sscs have little internal extinction ( @xmath2 1 mag ) . </S>",
    "<S> these contribute negligibly to the total bolometric luminosity .    </S>",
