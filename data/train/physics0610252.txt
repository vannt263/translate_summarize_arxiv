    "over the last twenty years , much effort has been done in generating ultrafast laser pulses in the few - cycle regime .",
    "these pulses are behind numerous and important achievements in such diverse fields as the study of ultrafast dynamics in matter , extreme nonlinear optics , high - order harmonic generation , and attosecond physics@xcite .",
    "low - energy ( nanojoule ) sub-2-cycle pulses have been directly produced by state - of - the - art ti : sapphire laser oscillators@xcite where the required ultrabroad bandwidths were achieved by means of double - chirped mirrors that provide high reflectivity bandwidth and tailored dispersion compensation over an extended spectral range .",
    "higher energy pulses ( from hundreds of nanojoules up to hundreds of microjoules ) have also been produced by passive and/or active phase control of broadband laser sources and of supercontinua generated in kerr media .",
    "these include ultra - broadband optical parametric amplifiers@xcite , spectrally broadened cavity - dumped oscillators@xcite , and gas - filled hollow fibers pumped by khz amplifiers@xcite where active compression of the generated broadband spectra has resulted in the shortest ( @xmath3 fs ) light pulses to date@xcite .    however , in all of the above techniques , the possibility of reaching the few - cycle regime relies on sophisticated intracavity or extracavity dispersion compensation schemes , with the latter usually requiring complex electronically - controlled feedback systems .",
    "a different approach to pulse compression relies on the concept of soliton - effect compression of laser pulses , which dates back to the 1980s@xcite and has been used to successfully compress low - energy picosecond pulses to durations as short as @xmath4fs@xcite without the need of additional dispersion compensation .",
    "this method exploits the peculiarities of high - order periodical soliton propagation in optical fibers in the anomalous dispersion regime , where efficient compression is obtained at the output end of a fiber of properly chosen length .",
    "a signature of this process is the appearance of a broad pedestal , which for relatively long pulses ( @xmath5fs ) can be efficiently suppressed by taking advantage of the birefringence induced by the intense main pulse in the fiber itself@xcite .    until recently",
    ", all theoretical and experimental studies of soliton compression were focused on normal single - mode fibers@xcite , which exhibit anomalous dispersion only for wavelengths larger than @xmath6 m , as well as a relatively low nonlinearity .",
    "the introduction of highly nonlinear photonic crystal fibers ( pcfs ) @xcite and photonics nanowires having anomalous dispersion at visible and near infrared wavelengths has shed a new light on this field , in particular in view of the possibility of applying soliton compression techniques to the pulses emitted by today s most common ultrafast lasers , such as ti : sapphire and cr : lisaf oscillators .",
    "specifically , the broad region of anomalous group delay dispersion ( which for photonic nanowires extends into the visible spectral region ) allows for the efficient compression of pulses in the @xmath0 nm region , as recently demonstrated by foster et al.@xcite , who experimentally achieved pulse compression of low - energy pulses from @xmath7fs down to @xmath8fs in photonic nanowires , and theoretically predicted pulses as short as one single optical cycle .",
    "even if photonic nanowires can exhibit flatter dispersion profiles in the visible and near - infrared regions than most pcfs , their use still poses difficulties , mostly due to their small dimensions , delicate construction , and implementation . on the other hand , pcfs with core sizes of around @xmath9 m and a high nonlinearity",
    "are readily available . in a recent work ,",
    "bessonov et al.@xcite theoretically investigated solitonic propagation and compression of high - energy laser pulses in hollow photonic crystal fibers , where pulse durations down to @xmath10fs at wavelengths of around @xmath6 m were predicted .",
    "however , to our knowledge , soliton self - compression of low - energy @xmath0 nm ultrashort pulses in highly nonlinear pcfs and in the few - cycle regime has not been studied so far .    in this work we investigate the possibility of efficient self - compression of low - energy laser pulses down to the few - cycle regime using a commercially available highly - nonlinear pcf .    we perform a systematic numerical study , based on a generalized nonlinear schrdinger equation that includes higher - order dispersion terms , delayed raman response and self - steepening , to identify the most relevant parameters that determine the compression limit .",
    "a detailed comparison between different approximations to nonlinear pulse propagation is made , in order to better isolate the detrimental effects that more strongly affect the compression process , which shows that pulses with durations a short as @xmath11fs can be directly obtained by propagating linearly chirped or transform limited low - energy pulses generated from a typical ( @xmath12fs ) ultrafast ti : sapphire oscillator in a pcf without the need of additional compression methods , which may result in novel and compact devices for the generation of laser pulses in the few - cycle regime .",
    "we believe that this study will be very helpful for predicting the output of actual experiments based on this technique .",
    "in our model , an ultrafast laser pulse as directly generated from a typical ( @xmath12fs ) commercially available ti : sapphire laser oscillator is coupled to a highly - nonlinear pcf of length @xmath13 .",
    "the propagation equation along the longitudinal fiber direction @xmath14 for an electric field envelope @xmath15 of central frequency @xmath16 and in the plane wave approximation is given by : @xmath17 , \\label{prop_eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the spectral field amplitude , @xmath19 is the phase distortion , with @xmath20 the @xmath21-order dispersion , and @xmath22 & = & \\gamma(1+\\frac{i}{\\omega_0}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t})(a(z , t)\\int_{0}^{+\\infty}r(t')|a(z , t - t')|^2 dt ' ) \\label{b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the nonlinear term with @xmath23 the nonlinearity coefficient and @xmath24 the nonlinear response function . the functional form of @xmath24 can be written as@xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the fractional contribution of the delayed raman response function @xmath27 , which can be expressed as : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are two adjustable parameters .",
    "numerical values of @xmath31 , @xmath32fs and @xmath33fs are chosen to provide a good fit to the measured raman gain spectrum of fused silica@xcite .",
    "the generalized nonlinear schrdinger equation ( gnse)([prop_eq ] ) includes both self - steepening and the delayed raman effect@xcite and accurately describes pulse propagation of few nj pulses in pcfs down to the single single cycle regime in the framework of the slowly evolving wave approximation ( sewa ) , which requires that the envelope and its phase do not vary @xmath34 as the pulse covers a distance equal to its central wavelength @xmath35@xcite . in the hypothesis of @xmath36 third - order dispersion",
    "( @xmath37 ) , self - steepening , and delayed raman response ( @xmath38 ) , equation([prop_eq ] ) reduces to the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nse ) , suitable for describing pulse propagation in the picosecond or even sub - picosecond temporal regime @xcite , provided that third- and higher - order dispersion terms can be neglected and pulse duration is significantly longer that the delayed raman response of the medium , @xmath39fs ( for fused silica ) .",
    "the fiber parameters are those of a @xmath40 highly - nonlinear pcf ( blazephotonics nl-1.6 - 670 ) already available in our laboratory and which we plan to use in a forthcoming experiment : @xmath41 mm , @xmath42w@xmath43mm@xmath43 , and a group velocity dispersion ( @xmath44 ) profile as shown in figure[figura1_sol_comp ] .",
    "soliton - effect compression relies on propagation properties of optical solitons which are generated in nonlinear fibers in the anomalous dispersion regime@xcite .",
    "in particular , solitons of order @xmath45 always change their shape periodically as they propagate inside the fiber and in general experience an initial pulse narrowing phase , which can be exploited to obtain pulse compression once a proper fiber length is chosen@xcite .",
    "the optimal fiber length @xmath46 and the compression factor @xmath47 can be estimated from the following empirical relations obtained in the framework of the nse@xcite : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the soliton order , @xmath50 is the dispersion length , @xmath51 is the nonlinear length , @xmath52 is the soliton period , @xmath53 is the pulse initial full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) duration , and @xmath54 is the peak power of the initial pulse . in general , the compressed pulses exhibit a broad pedestal whose origin is due to the fact that the nonlinearity induces a linear chirp only over the central part of the pulse , which is the only part that can be efficiently compressed by the fiber anomalous group velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "the quality factor @xmath55 , defined as the fraction of the total energy contained in the compressed pulse , is always less than unity and scales as the inverse of the compression factor @xmath47@xcite .",
    "equations([sol_eff_rel ] ) predict an indefinitely increasing compression factor for an initial fixed pulse temporal profile with increasing peak power , once a proper fiber length is chosen .",
    "however , equations([sol_eff_rel ] ) are obtained by integrating the nse , which fails to be valid in the few femtosecond temporal regime , so the gnse has to be used instead .",
    "the best conditions for soliton pulse compression were obtained starting from a @xmath56fs initial fourier transform - limited ( tl ) gaussian pulse with central wavelenght @xmath57 nm , which can be generated from the ultrafast ti : sapphire laser oscillator we intend to use in our future experiment@xcite .",
    "our numerical study shows that a typical @xmath56fs few - nj femtosecond pulse requires an optimum fiber length considerably shorter than @xmath1 mm , which immediately poses a practical problem as it is very difficult to obtain such short fiber lengths .",
    "however , this length can be increased if the initial pulse duration is made larger for the same pulse energy and we found that initial pulse durations of around @xmath2fs readily allow to overcome this difficulty .",
    "therefore , we chose to introduce a positive linear dispersive material to temporally broaden the initial @xmath56fs pulse so as to produce the optimal pulse peak intensity and temporal width at the fiber input ( see figure[figura2_sol_comp ] ) .",
    "we also found that this method resulted in the same compressed pulse as if the spectral width ( hence temporal duration ) of the initial tl pulse was varied instead .",
    "the former method was nevertheless preferred to the latter , as in principle it permits arbitrarily large extra - cavity pulse stretching while retaining the initial pulse spectrum generated from the laser oscillator , hence avoiding disturbances to the laser parameters and mode - locking stability .",
    "figure[figura3_sol_comp ] shows the spectrum , the spectral phase and the temporal profile of the pulse ( a ) at the fiber input , and for fiber lengths of ( b ) @xmath58 mm , ( c ) @xmath59 mm , and ( d ) @xmath60 mm , assuming an initial pulse energy @xmath61j and a pulse duration broadened to @xmath62fs in a normal positively dispersive medium such as a piece of glass , so as to obtain an optimized compressed pulse for @xmath41 mm under the condition that the most intense pre / post - pulse has an intensity lower than @xmath63 times the pulse peak value . it can be observed that the compression process mostly acts upon the central part of the pulse temporal profile , while maintaining a broad uncompressed pedestal , until a pulse fhwm duration @xmath64fs and a quality factor @xmath65 are reached .",
    "the central wavelength of the resulting broadened spectrum does not deviate significantly from @xmath0 nm , and so the compressed pulse is less than two cycles in duration . for @xmath66 mm ( see figure[figura3_sol_comp](d ) and ( e ) ) the pulse temporal profile presents an increasing multi - peak and broadened structure .",
    "the asymmetric spectral profile , larger in the @xmath67 side , and the steeper temporal trailing edge shown in figure[figura3_sol_comp ] ( c ) are those typical of self - steepening , while raman scattering is characterized by a shift of the pulse spectrum towards lower frequencies , which is associated with a temporal delay of the pulse@xcite . in figure[figura4_sol_comp ] the spatial evolution of the temporal pulse width , the quality factor and the relative intensity of the largest secondary pre / post pulse are reported , showing how the pulse compression process is always associated with a reduction in pulse @xmath68 .",
    "the behavior shown in figures[figura3_sol_comp ] and[figura4_sol_comp ] differs from the soliton pulse evolution predicted by the nse as the higher - order dispersion and nonlinear effects included in the gnse destroy the periodical evolution typical of high - order solitons .",
    "a systematical numerical study was performed to identify which processes have the most detrimental effect in the pulse compression process .",
    "figures[figura5_sol_comp](a ) and(b ) show the final temporal width and the quality factor as a function of the pulse energy , obtained by integrating the gnse ( curves ( 1 ) ) , neglecting higher - order dispersion ( curves ( 2 ) ) , neglecting self - steepening and delayed raman response ( curves ( 3 ) ) , and integrating the nse ( curves ( 4 ) ) .",
    "the reported values correspond to the narrowest obtainable pulse with a pre / post pulse relative intensity lower than @xmath63 .",
    "it can be noticed that higher - order dispersion terms have the most detrimental effect in the compressed pulses , making curves ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in figure[figura4_sol_comp ] ( a ) go through a minimum value and therefore deviating from the monotone behavior predicted by relations([sol_eff_rel ] ) and confirmed by curves ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) . in this view",
    "the way of increasing the pulse compression effect mostly relies on using a nonlinear fiber with the flattest possible group velocity dispersion .",
    "these results are reminiscient of those obtained for longer pulse durations in the @xmath2fs range@xcite . in the ideal hypothesis of a completely flat group velocity dispersion profile , for the same pulse energy and temporal width of figure[figura3_sol_comp ] , a compressed single - cycle pulse with @xmath69fs and @xmath70 can be obtained ( see figure[figura6_sol_comp ] ) .",
    "the need of additional dispersive polarization elements that introduce significant pulse broadening prevents the direct application of standard nonlinear birrefringe methods to suppress the observed broad pedestal found in soliton compressed pulses .",
    "the pedestal could nevertheless be partially suppressed by simply focusing the pulses in a thin ( @xmath71 m ) , low - dispersion near infrared low - bandpass filter , which can act as an efficient saturable absorber for femtosecond pulses@xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we numerically demonstrate the feasibility of efficient soliton compression of transform - limited or linearly chirped ultrashort laser pulses down to the sub-2-cycle regime using a standard ti : sapphire oscillator and a @xmath1-mm long commercially available pcf . an optimized @xmath72fs pulse can be obtained from an initial ultrashort laser pulse centered at @xmath0 nm , with duration in the @xmath73fs range and an energy of @xmath74nj , while longer pulses can also be compressed at slightly higher pulse energies of a few nj .",
    "we identify high - order dispersion as the most relevant detrimental factor in few - cycle soliton compression , showing that single - cycle pulses with @xmath75fs can be obtained for the ideal case of a pcf with a completely flat dispersion profile .",
    "we believe that this technique could be the basis for novel , compact and efficient sources of few - cycle laser pulses based on a standard ultrafast oscillator coupled to a properly chosen pcf and a simple pulse cleaner , which could have a great impact in the scientific community .",
