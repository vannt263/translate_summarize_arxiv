    "longitudinal relaxation ( t@xmath3 relaxation ) and transverse relaxation ( t@xmath4 relaxation ) are the most important parameters in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) .",
    "many factors can contribute to t@xmath3 and t@xmath4 relaxations .",
    "it is well known that , for liquid or gaseous samples , such as spin polarized @xmath1he , diffusion in a non - uniform magnetic field can cause both t@xmath3 and t@xmath4 relaxations .",
    "in this manuscript , @xmath5 and @xmath6 represent the relaxation rates solely due to diffusion in a magnetic field gradient .",
    "the transverse relaxation due to diffusion in free space was first solved by torrey @xcite .",
    "he generalized the bloch equation by adding a diffusion term and unveiled that the envelope of the transverse component of the magnetization decays as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the diffusion constant , @xmath9 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the spin and @xmath10 is a constant gradient . in practice , most diffusion happens in confined spaces , and the stochastic diffusion process is restricted , which makes the problem more complicated .",
    "robertson @xcite solved the bloch - torrey equation @xcite in restricted geometries , by imposing boundary conditions to the equation .",
    "his approximate analytical solution showed that the envelop decays exponentially with a constant relaxation rate .",
    "this result is valid when @xmath11 , where l is the distance between the boundaries .",
    "this limit is also known as fast diffusion limit or motional averaging regime , where spins have moved across the geometry many times in a time period @xmath12 and therefore any fluctuation in the magnetic field averages out and a faster diffusion actually reduces the relaxation .",
    "neuman @xcite solved the same problem by calculating the accumulated phases of spins with the assumption that the relative phase distribution of spins is gaussian in both the slow diffusion and fast diffusion limits .",
    "his slow diffusion result reproduces the free diffusion result , eq .",
    "( [ eq : torrey ] ) , and the fast diffusion result is the same as that of robertson . in the intermediate regime , the gaussian phase approximation ( gpa ) fails .",
    "however , it is crucial to quantitatively understand the intermediate regime because many experiments have shown edge enhancement phenomena in the slow diffusion and intermediate regime , which was recognized later as a localization regime @xcite .",
    "people have observed that , when water diffuses in microscopic structures , the mri signal is enhanced at the edge of the structure @xcite .",
    "_ have also showed a similar edge enhancement effect , using hyperpolarized @xmath1he gas in cells with dimensions of about 1 cm @xcite .",
    "this effect is ascribed to the more restricted diffusion at the boundary , which lessens the relaxation , and was first described quantitatively by de swiet @xcite , using airy functions .",
    "airy functions have been shown to be the eigenfunction of the bloch - torrey equation in the intermediate regime @xcite .",
    "axelrod also showed that although gpa fails in the intermediate regime , it can be used to interpolate the result in this regime , which turns out to be close to the exact solution @xcite .",
    "more detailed discussion on the restricted diffusion in various limits can be found in a review article @xcite and references therein .    despite of the widely used gpa method , cates _",
    "_ used the second order time - dependent perturbation theory and carried out an expansion of spin density matrix to obtain both longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates for a spherical cell @xcite .",
    "their results works only in the fast diffusion regime , and they further divided the fast diffusion regime into two limits : the high pressure limit @xmath13 and the low pressure limit @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the larmor precession frequency and @xmath16 is the radius of the spherical cell .",
    "these two limits can be thought of as the characteristic spin precession time @xmath17 being much shorter or longer than the characteristic diffusion time in the cell @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "mcgregor @xcite used redfield theory discussed in @xcite to solve the same problem also in the fast diffusion regime .",
    "redfield theory is a generalized treatment of the second - order time - dependent perturbation theory .",
    "it establishes a set of differential equations obeyed by the spin density matrix .",
    "therefore , it is closely related to the treatment of cates _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . by calculating autocorrelation function of spin under different geometries ,",
    "mcgregor was able to obtain transverse relaxation rates in the fast diffusion limit for different geometries , including slabs , cylinders and spheres .    in this manuscript",
    ", we make an extension to mcgregor s approach , which yields an analytical solution to the transverse magnetization suitable for all diffusion regimes .",
    "when @xmath19 , this solution reproduces torrey s free diffusion result ; when time @xmath20 , it is in the intermediate regime . in these two regimes , edge enhancement effect is also observed .",
    "eventually , when @xmath11 , it is in the motional averaging regime and a peak located at the center of the frequency spectrum is observed .",
    "we also performed free induction decay ( fid ) measurements on polarized @xmath1he gas to verify the theoretical results . by changing the number density of the gas ,",
    "the observed transverse relaxation happens in different diffusion regimes .",
    "when the decay envelopes are compared to the theoretical predictions , they are found to be in good agreements , especially in the intermediate regime .",
    "in addition to the transverse relaxation , our approach can also be used to calculate longitudinal relaxation in different regimes .",
    "we found that the longitudinal relaxation rate @xmath5 in the slow diffusion limit is twice as fast as that in the fast diffusion limit .",
    "as diffusion in the fast diffusion regime is more restricted , it could explain this factor of two difference . in this manuscript",
    ", we solve the problem in 1d for clarification purpose .",
    "however , it can be easily extended to 3d with complex geometries since one only needs to calculate the corresponding probability density function .",
    "once the density function is known , the relaxation rate can be calculated readily , which makes this approach suitable for numerical simulations of complex geometries .",
    "for simplicity , let spins diffuse in a cubic cell with length @xmath21 .",
    "a non - uniform magnetic field is applied along the @xmath22 direction . at time @xmath23 , we track a spin starting at @xmath24 . as time evolves , the expected position of the spin will change due to the diffusion process .",
    "therefore , we use @xmath25 to represent the expected position of spin at some later time @xmath12 and has the property that @xmath26 .",
    "since the field is non - uniform over the box , the spins also see fluctuating magnetic fields during diffusion . the fluctuating field @xmath27 can be treated as a perturbation to the zeroth order mean field @xmath28 by taking taylor expansion around @xmath29 , @xmath30 as described in @xcite , redfield theory gives solutions to the problem with fluctuating magnetic fields . in our case ,",
    "the applied field is constant in time ; however the time dependence appears because of the diffusion process .",
