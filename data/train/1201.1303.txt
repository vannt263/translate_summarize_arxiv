    "several independent lines of observational evidence support the conclusion that the majority of the matter in our universe consists of cold dark matter , rather than baryons or other known particle species  @xcite .",
    "these observations , however , reveal little about the nature of the dark matter itself .",
    "an enormous variety of dark matter candidates have been proposed , ranging in mass from @xmath2@xmath3 ev axions to superheavy ( _ i.e. _  gut or planck scale ) particles . from among this vast landscape of dark matter candidates , the class known as weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) are among the most strongly motivated .",
    "the hierarchy problem requires new physics to appear at or around the electroweak scale , but in order to be consistent with the stringent constraints of electroweak precision measurements , the interactions of those particles must be limited , such as by a symmetry or parity which in many cases leads to the stability of one or more state .",
    "a stable particle with a weak - scale mass , @xmath4 , will be produced and freeze - out in the early universe with a thermal relic density given by @xmath5^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath6 is the self - annihilation cross section of the particle , evaluated at the time of freeze - out .",
    "as @xmath7 @xmath1/s is similar to the value estimated for a generic weak - scale interaction , we conclude that a gev - tev scale stable particle with a roughly weak - scale annihilation cross section will naturally be produced in the early universe with an abundance similar to the observed density of dark matter .",
    "this argument , sometimes referred to as the `` wimp miracle '' , applies equally well to particles with 1 - 20 gev masses as to those with masses more traditionally associated with supersymmetric neutralino dark matter ( @xmath8 gev ) .",
    "it is not at all difficult to construct a viable particile physics model which includes a @xmath210 gev wimp that is produced in the early universe with an abundance equal to the observed density of dark matter .",
    "if the dark matter consists of wimps , these particles could potentially be observed through a variety of techniques .",
    "direct detection experiments attempt to observe the recoil from the elastic scattering of dark matter particles interacting with nuclei in a detector .",
    "indirect detection experiments are designed to observe and identify the annihilation products of wimps , such as gamma - rays , neutrinos , cosmic rays , and emission at radio / microwave wavelengths .",
    "alternatively , one could potentially produce and observe dark matter particles in collider experiments , such as at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . while each of these approaches have their advantages and disadvantages ,",
    "it is interesting to note that all three of these strategies for detecting dark matter particles have reached or are about to reach the level of sensitivity that has long anticipated to be required to observe most postulated varieties of wimps .    over the past several years , a number of observational signals",
    "have been reported which can be interpreted as interactions of dark matter particles . while anomalous or otherwise difficult to explain astrophysical signals are often interpreted as possible products of dark matter annihilations ( for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , these anomalies are in most cases ultimately found to have non - exotic origins , whether astrophysical or instrumental . in order for the scientific community to become convinced that a given signal or collection of signals does in fact arise from dark matter particles , those observations will have to be favorably compared to the predictions of the dark matter hypothesis in several different ways .",
    "ideally , the set of observations will overconstrain the problem in such a way that conclusions can be made which are largely independent of astrophysical uncertainties and choices in the particle dark matter model .    in this article , i will attempt to make the case that these stringent criteria required to convincingly identify dark matter interactions are largely satisfied by the body of evidence that has accumulated in favor of @xmath210 gev dark matter particles .",
    "these data include the spectral and morphological distribution of gamma - rays from the galactic center  @xcite , the synchrotron emission from the inner galaxy  @xcite , the synchrotron emission from radio filaments in the inner galaxy  @xcite , and signals from three direct detection experiments , dama / libra  @xcite , cogent  @xcite , and cresst - ii  @xcite . as i will describe in more detail later this in this article , the gamma - ray signal observed from the galactic center is consistent with 7 - 12 gev dark matter particles annihilating mostly to leptons with an annihilation cross section consistent with that of a thermal relic ( as motivated by the `` wimp miracle '' , @xmath9 @xmath1/s ) , and with a distribution in good agreement with the results of hydrodynamical simulations ( @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the distance to the galactic center ) . no viable astrophysical explanations for this emission",
    "are known ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion ) . using this choice for the dark matter mass , annihilation cross section , annihilation channels , and spatial distribution",
    ", one can predict the spectrum , intensity , and angular distribution of synchrotron emission resulting from electron and positron dark matter annihilation products in the inner galaxy and compare this to that observed by wmap ( the `` wmap haze '' ) and from the milky way s radio filaments . in each of these cases ,",
    "there is good agreement between these observations and the predictions of the gamma - ray motivated dark matter model .",
    "this scenario is further supported by the observations reported by the dama / libra  @xcite , cogent  @xcite , and cresst  @xcite collaborations , which each report signals consistent with a dark matter particle of similar mass .",
    "these three experiments make use of different technologies , target materials , and detection strategies , but each report results which are not compatible with known backgrounds , but that can be accommodated by a dark matter particle with a @xmath210 gev mass and an elastic scattering cross section with nuclei of approximately a few times @xmath12 @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "these six distinct observations ( of the fermi galactic center , the milky way radio filaments , the wmap haze , and signals from dama / libra , cogent and cresst - ii ) provide a collection of evidence for @xmath210 gev dark matter particles with 1 ) is unable to be explained by proposed or known backgrounds , 2 ) overconstrains the properties of the underlying dark matter model , and 3 ) is consistent with theoretical expectations . by overconstraining the model , i mean that multiple observations require the same distribution , mass , and cross sections for dark matter .",
    "for example , one could not interpret the spectra of the milky way s radio filaments as signals of dark matter annihilations if the wmap haze was not also observed  the annihilation rate and channels required to power the radio filaments requires a haze - like signal to also be present . similarly ,",
    "if the radial profile of the wmap haze or the collection of radio filaments had a much shallower or steeper distribution , it would not be easily reconciled with the dark matter profile implied by the gamma ray observations of the galactic center .",
    "furthermore , if cogent had seen no evidence of annual modulation in their event rate , it would be very difficult to interpret dama / libra s modulation as dark matter , and vice versa . by consistent with theoretical expectations ,",
    "i mean that the dark matter particle required to explain these observations possesses an annihilation cross section consistent with a simple thermal relic , and does not require any unexpected or baroque features ( such as large boost factors , non - standard dark matter distributions , or non - minimal particle physics features such as sommerfeld enhancements or inelastic scattering ) .",
    "the primary purpose of this article is to summarize in a self - consistent way these observations and their implications for dark matter .",
    "much of the material described here has been presented previously elsewhere , and the reader is encouraged to follow the references ( in particular refs .",
    "@xcite ) to find many of the details that have been omitted here .",
    "the remainder of the article is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ indirect ] , i discuss the gamma - ray signal from the galactic center as observed by the fermi gamma - ray space telescope , as well as the synchrotron signals observed from the milky way s radio filaments , and from the inner galaxy by wmap . in sec .",
    "[ direct ] , i discuss the direct detection signals reported by dama / libra , cogent , and cresst - ii . in sec .",
    "[ particle ] , i discuss the particle physics implications of these observations and explore some of features of models that contain a dark matter candidate capable of producing these signals .",
    "finally , in sec .",
    "[ summary ] , i summarize these results and draw conclusions .",
    "before discussing any specific observations , i will begin by asking the question , `` what would a 10 gev annihilating dark matter particle look like to indirect detection experiments ? ''",
    "although the answer to this question depends to a degree on the detailed properties of the dark matter particle being considered , a few very general and model - independent statements can be made .",
    "one the one hand , as the total dark matter annihilation rate is proportional to @xmath14 , dark matter particles with relatively light masses are expected to produce significantly brighter annihilation signals than are predicted from heavier particles . on the other hand , many indirect detection experiments have energy thresholds which make them insensitive to the annihilation products of low mass dark matter particles .",
    "large volume neutrino telescopes such as icecube ( deepcore ) , for example , are sensitive only to neutrinos above @xmath250 - 100 gev ( @xmath210 gev ) . for light dark matter particles , we are thus forced to rely on much smaller neutrino detectors with lower energy thresholds , such as super - kamiokande .",
    "similarly , ground - based gamma - ray telescopes such as hess , veritas and magic are almost entirely blind to gamma - rays below @xmath250 - 100 gev .",
    "furthermore , the spectrum of @xmath21 - 10 gev cosmic rays is significantly impacted by the effects of the solar winds , diffusive reacceleration , convection , and other astrophysical phenomena which make them more difficult to model and interpret than their higher energy counterparts .",
    "so while many indirect detection experiments are not sensitive to relatively light dark matter particles , those which are able to detect low - energy annihilation products are likely to observe quite large fluxes of such products .",
    "particularly promising strategies for identifying such light dark matter particles are those being employed by the fermi gamma - ray space telescope ( fgst ) and various radio and microwave telescopes . for @xmath210 gev dark matter particles with an annihilation cross sections on the order of @xmath7 @xmath1/s , these experiments",
    "are generally predicted to observe quite bright and likely observable signals .",
    "the annihilation rate of dark matter at a given location in space depends on both the annihilation cross section of the particle and on the square of its number density . and",
    "while we do not know precisely how the dark matter is distributed or with what cross section it annihilates , we do possess information which enables us to make reasonable and informed estimates of these quantities .    as stated in the introduction ,",
    "the dark matter annihilation cross section is related to its thermal relic abundance .",
    "in particular , a stable particle with a mass in the gev to tev range will be produced thermally in the early universe with a density equal to the measured dark matter abundance if it self - annihilates with a cross section of @xmath15 @xmath1/s  @xcite .",
    "for a gev - tev thermal relic , this can be thought of as an approximate upper limit on the annihilation cross section today ( unless very light force carriers lead to sommerfeld enhancements  @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible that the annihilation cross section today could be lower than this value if velocity - dependent terms in the annihilation cross section contribute significantly to the process of thermal freeze - out , but do not contribute significantly to the current annihilation rate .",
    "coannihilations between the dark matter and another state could also play an important role in freeze out  @xcite , although for the light mass range being considered here , this is unlikely to be the case . taken together , the relic abundance calculation leads us to expect the dark matter to annihilate with a cross section as large as , and likely not very much smaller than , @xmath16 @xmath1/s .",
    "our knowledge of the distribution of dark matter in the milky way is based on a combination of observational constraints and numerical simulations .",
    "observations of the milky way s rotation curve and its gravitational microlensing optical depth are best fit by a cusped dark matter distribution , @xmath17 , although with large uncertainties  @xcite . and",
    "while numerical simulations which model the evolution of cold dark matter without baryons tend to find halos with inner profiles of approximately @xmath18  @xcite , hydrodynamical simulations which include the baryonic processes involved in galaxy formation have begun to converge in favor of milky way - like halos being significantly contracted  @xcite , leading to a steepening of their inner profiles from @xmath18 to slopes typically in the range of @xmath19 to @xmath20 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the highest annihilation rates occur in the high density central regions of dark matter halos .",
    "the center of the milky way , in particular , has long been recognized as the single most promising target of indirect detection efforts  @xcite .",
    "10 gev dark matter particles annihilating with a cross section of @xmath21 @xmath1/s and distributed as @xmath17 release energy in annihilation products at a rate of @xmath22 gev / s within the innermost 150 parsecs around the galactic center ( corresponding to approximately the innermost @xmath23 ) . as we will see in the remainder of this section , this power is comparable to that observed in gamma - rays from the galactic center by fermi .",
    "this annihilation rate is also in good agreement with that required to power the observed synchrotron emission from the milky way s radio filaments and the synchrotron emission from the inner galaxy known as the `` wmap haze '' .",

    "the disk model is based on the observed morphology of the disk at angles beyond @xmath24 , and agree very well with observations of 21-cm surveys , which trace the density of neutral hydrogen  @xcite .",
    "note that the central bright source has not been removed , as its emission is difficult to disentangle from dark matter annihilation products originating from the inner region of a cusped halo profile .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "the gamma - ray residuals shown in the right frames of fig .  [ maps ] resemble in both spectrum and morphology the signal one would expect from dark matter annihilations .",
    "first of all , the angular distribution of the observed residual is spatially extended and is not consistent with that of a single point source . in fig",
    ".  [ spec ] , we plot the spectrum of the residual emission as shown in the right frames of fig .",
    "[ maps ] . also shown as a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ spec ] is the broken power - law spectrum of point - like emission as reported by three independent groups  @xcite .",
    "less than half of the residual emission at energies above 300 mev can be accounted for by a single , centrally - located point source ( presumably associated with the milky way s supermassive black hole ) .",
    "furthermore , the extended component of the emission is strongly peaked at energies between 300 mev and 10 gev , and drops suddenly above @xmath210 gev .",
    "such a peaked spectrum is consistent with dark matter annihilation products .    to account for this spatially extended component of gamma - rays",
    ", we include in fig .",
    "[ spec ] the spectrum from the annihilations of a 10 gev dark matter particle ( dot - dashed ) and from a component extrapolated from hess s observations of the galactic ridge ( dots )  @xcite .",
    "the sum of these contributions ( solid ) provides a good fit to the total observed spectrum , for dark matter which annihilates mostly to leptons ( the gamma - ray flux is dominated by annihilations to @xmath25 ) , possibly with a subdominant fraction proceeding to hadronic final states .",
    "to accommodate the angular extent of the observed gamma - ray signal , a dark matter distribution of approximately @xmath26 to @xmath27 is required  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the annihilation cross section required to normalize the gamma - ray signal is not far from the value predicted for a simple thermal relic ( @xmath21 @xmath1/s ) . adopting central values for the local dark matter density  @xcite ,",
    "the annihilation cross section to @xmath28 is required to be @xmath29 @xmath1/s for a dark matter distribution with an inner slope of 1.3 to 1.4 .",
    "if the dark matter also annihilates to electrons and muons at a similar rate , the total annihilation cross section falls within a factor of a few of the canonical estimate of @xmath30 @xmath1/s .",
    "the fermi collaboration has also presented preliminary findings  @xcite which describe a spectrum of excess emission consistent with that found in ref .",
    "@xcite . ]",
    "although astrophysical origins of the gamma - ray emission observed from the galactic center region have been discussed  @xcite , considerable challenges are faced by such interpretations .",
    "possibilities that have been considered include emission from the central supermassive black hole  @xcite , and from a population of unresolved point sources , such as millisecond pulsars  @xcite .    in the case of the supermassive black hole ,",
    "direct emission from this object is not consistent with the observed morphology of the gamma - ray signal .",
    "the observed angular extent of the emission could be reconciled , however , if the gamma - rays originate from cosmic rays that have been accelerated by the black hole and then diffuse throughout the surrounding interstellar medium , producing pions through interactions with gas  @xcite . the spectral shape of the spatially extended emission is very difficult to account for with gamma - rays from pion decay , however .",
    "even for a monoenergetic spectrum of protons , the resulting spectrum of gamma - rays from pion decay does not rise rapidly enough to account for the observed gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "a large population of unresolved gamma - ray pulsars surrounding the galactic center has also been proposed to account for the observed emission  @xcite .",
    "the spectra observed from among the 46 pulsars in the fgst s first pulsar catalog , however , are typically much softer than is observed from the galactic center  @xcite . unless the spectra among the population of pulsars surrounding the galactic center is significantly different from those observed elsewhere , it does not appear to be possible to account for the observed signal with pulsars .",
    "furthermore , it is also difficult to accommodate the very spatially concentrated morphology of the observed gamma - ray emission with pulsars . to match the observed angular distribution of this signal",
    ", the number density of pulsars would have to fall off with the distance to the galactic center at least as rapidly as @xmath31 .",
    "in contrast , within the innermost parsec of the galactic center , the stellar density has been observed to fall off only about half as rapidly , @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "even modest pulsar kicks of @xmath33 km / s would allow a pulsar 10 pc from the galactic center to escape the region , consequently broadening the angular width of the signal .",
    "unlike with most astrophysical sources or mechanisms , annihilating dark matter produces a flux of gamma - rays that scales with its density _ squared _ , and thus can much more easily account for the high concentration of the observed signal from the galactic center .",
    "if dark matter annihilations produce mostly charged leptons , as implied by the galactic center s gamma - ray spectrum , then electrons and positrons should carry away much of the total power produced in this process .",
    "electron and positron cosmic rays lose much of their energy to synchrotron emission , providing a potentially detectable signal for telescopes operating at radio and microwave frequencies  @xcite .",
    "particularly promising sources of dark matter - powered synchrotron emission are the peculiar astrophysical objects known as non - thermal radio filaments .",
    "radio filaments are long ( @xmath240  pc ) and thin ( @xmath21  pc ) structures , found at distances between 10 and 200  pc from the galactic center .",
    "the very hard spectra of highly polarized radio synchrotron emission observed from these objects  @xcite imply that they contain highly ordered poloidal magnetic fields of strength on the order of @xmath2100 @xmath34 g  @xcite .",
    "these strong and highly ordered magnetic fields lead the filaments to act as magnetic mirrors , efficiently rejecting incident electrons and retaining those electrons within their volumes .    the spectrum of electrons that must be contained within the milky way s radio filaments in order to produce their extremely hard synchrotron emission has long been a challenge to explain astrophysically . since the 1980s ,",
    "observations of radio filaments have revealed a turnover at @xmath210  ghz in the synchrotron spectrum , implying an electron energy spectrum that is strongly peaked ( sometimes described in the radio astronomy literature as `` monoenergetic ''  ) at an energy of approximately @xmath210 gev , propagating in a magnetic field on the order of 100  @xmath34 g  .",
    "the leading astrophysical mechanism proposed to explain these spectra involves magnetic reconnection zones that are formed in collisions between radio filaments and molecular clouds , leading to an electric potential capable of accelerating electrons to their required energy  .",
    "this scenario fails , however , to explain why so many observed radio filaments exhibit such similar spectra   ( especially those without associations with molecular clouds  @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , recent simulations find that it is unlikely that such a mechanism would be capable of accelerating electrons to energies much above 10  mev , several orders of magnitude below that needed to explain the observed synchrotron signal  @xcite .",
    "10 gev . here , we compare the observed spectra of four particularly well measured radio filaments  @xcite to that predicted from dark matter annihilations ( @xmath35 gev , annihilating equally to @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath28 with @xmath38 @xmath1  s@xmath39 ) compared to the observed intensity and spectrum of g0.2 - 0.0 ( the radio arc , top left ) , g0.08 + 0.15 ( northern thread , top right ) , g0.16 - 0.14 ( arc filament , bottom left ) and g359.1 - 0.2 ( the snake , bottom right ) .",

    "[ fig:4 ] , the spectrum of radio emission observed from four particularly well measured filaments  @xcite is compared to the synchrotron flux and spectrum predicted from the electrons produced through the annihilations of a 10 gev dark matter particle .",

    "we have adopted values of the magnetic field ( @xmath42 ) and the ratio of timescales for diffusion and synchrotron losses ( @xmath43 ) which best accommodate the observed spectra . in each case",

    "a particularly powerful test of the dark matter interpretation for the emission of radio filaments is the strong dependence of the luminosity with distance to the galactic center that is predicted . for a dark matter distribution of the form @xmath17 ( as motivated by the morphology of the galactic center gamma - ray signal )",

    "whereas any electrons and positrons produced within the volumes of radio filaments will have their energy rapidly converted into the hard and polarized synchrotron emission observed from those filaments , dark matter annihilations taking place elsewhere in the inner milky way will produce a more diffuse synchrotron signal through interactions with the galactic magnetic field .",
    "in addition to cosmic microwave background photons , the wmap ( wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ) experiment has provided the best measurements to date of a number of standard emission mechanisms known to take place in the interstellar medium , including emission from thermal dust , spinning dust , ionized gas , and synchrotron  @xcite .",

    "alternatively , one could consider annihilations through the @xmath104-channel exchange of a particle with lepton number ( or a scenario in which the dark matter particles which themselves carry lepton number ) .      in most models ,",

    "the evidence for approximately 10 gev dark matter particles presented here is suggestive of a connection with the baryon asymmetry .",

    "consistency with the results of the xenon-10 and xenon-100 collaborations requires either a suppression in the response of liquid xenon to low - energy nuclear recoils , or destructive inference between the dark matter s couplings to protons and neutrons . in the relatively near future , data from planck , ams-02 , cdms , and",
    "the lhc could be able to further strengthen ( or weaken ) the case for a dark matter interpretation of these signals .",

    "<S> this collection of observations can be explained by a relatively light dark matter particle with an annihilation cross section consistent with that predicted for a simple thermal relic ( @xmath0 @xmath1/s ) and with a distribution in the halo of the milky way consistent with that predicted from simulations . </S>",
    "<S> astrophysical explanations for the gamma ray and synchrotron signals , in contrast , have not been successful in accommodating these observations . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the phase of the annual modulation observed by dama / libra ( and now supported by cogent ) is inconsistent with all known or postulated modulating backgrounds , but are in good agreement with expectations for dark matter scattering . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario is consistent with all existing indirect and collider constraints , as well as the constraints placed by cdms . </S>",
    "<S> consistency with xenon - based experiments can be achieved if the response of liquid xenon to very low - energy nuclear recoils is somewhat suppressed relative to previous evaluations , or if the dark matter possesses different couplings to protons and neutrons . </S>"
