    "the investigation of heavy quark production in high energy hadron collisions is an important method for studying the quark - gluon structure of hadrons .",
    "the description of hard interactions in hadron collisions within the framework of qcd is possible only with the help of some phenomenology , which reduces the hadron - hadron interaction to the parton - parton one via the formalism of the hadron structure functions .",
    "the cross sections of hard processes in hadron - hadron interactions can be written as the convolutions of sub - process qcd matrix elements squared with the parton distributions in the colliding hadrons .",
    "the most popular and technically simplest approach is the so - called qcd collinear approximation , or parton model ( pm ) . in this model",
    "all particles involved are assumed to be on mass shell , carrying only longitudinal momenta , and the cross section is averaged over two transverse polarizations of the incident gluons .",
    "the virtualities @xmath1 of the initial partons are taken into account only through their structure functions .",
    "the cross sections of qcd subprocess are calculated usually in the next to leading order ( nlo ) @xcite of @xmath2 expansion .",
    "the transverse momenta of the incident partons are neglected in the qcd matrix elements .",
    "this is the direct analogy of the weizsaecker - williams approximation in qed .",
    "another possibility to incorporate the incident parton transverse momenta is referred to as @xmath0-factorization approach @xcite , or the theory of semihard interactions @xcite . here",
    "the feynman diagrams are calculated with account of the virtualities and possible polarizations of the incident partons . in the small @xmath3 domain",
    "there are no grounds to neglect the transverse momenta of the gluons , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , in comparison with the quark mass and transverse momenta , @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , at the very high energies and @xmath6 the main contribution to the cross sections comes from the region @xmath7 or @xmath8 , see @xcite for details .",
    "the qcd matrix elements of the sub - processes are rather complicated in such an approach .",
    "we have calculated them in the lo . on the other hand , the multiple emission of soft gluons is effectively included here .",
    "that is why it is the question which approach is more constructive .",
    "the @xmath0-factorization approach is based on so - called unintegrated parton distributions which , at the moment , are known with insufficient accuracy . here",
    "we find them with the help of the realistic gluon distribution grv94 @xcite which is compatible with the most recent data , see discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in sect .  2 we present very shortly the formalism of the @xmath0-factorization approach .",
    "the comparison of our numerical results with some experimental data on beauty production at tevatron - collider together with the predictions including lhc energy are discussed in sect .",
    "predictions of the @xmath0-factorization approach for heavy quark photoproduction for hera are given in sect .",
    "the main contribution to the cross section of heavy quark production at small @xmath3 is known to come from @xmath9 subprocess ( and @xmath10 in the case of photoproduction ) .",
    "the transverse momenta of the incident gluons in the small-@xmath3 region result in the @xmath0-factorization approach from @xmath11 gluon diffusion .",
    "this is described by the so - called unintegrating gluon distribution which can be written in the form @xcite",
    "@xmath12 t_g(q_t,\\mu ) \\;,\\ ] ] where the survival probability @xmath13 that gluon @xmath14 with the transverse momentum @xmath15 remains untouched in the evolution up to the factorization scale @xmath16 is @xmath17 \\;.\\ ] ] here @xmath18 denotes @xmath19 or @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are the splitting functions .",
    "we have to emphasize that @xmath22 is just the quantity which enters into the feynman diagrams .",
    "the distributions @xmath22 involve two hard scales is integrated up to the scale @xmath16 . ] : @xmath15 and the scale @xmath16 of the probe .",
    "the scale @xmath16 plays a dual role . on the one hand it acts as the factorization scale , while on the other hand it controls the angular ordering of the partons emitted in the evolution @xcite .",
    "the factorization scale @xmath16 separates the partons associated with the emission off both the beam and target protons ( in @xmath23 collisions ) and off the hard subprocess .",
    "for example , it separates emissions off the beam ( with polar angle @xmath24 in c.s.m . ) from those off the target ( with @xmath25 in c.s.m . ) , and from the intermediate partons from the hard subprocess .",
    "this separation was proved in @xcite and originates from the destructive interference of the different emission amplitudes ( feynman diagrams ) in the angular boundary regions .",
    "if the longitudinal momentum fraction is fixed by the hard subprocess , then the limits of the angles can be expresseed in terms of the factorization scale @xmath16 which corresponds to the upper limit of the allowed value of the @xmath26-channel parton @xmath0 .",
    "the expression ( 1 ) with the survival probability ( 2 ) provides the positivity of the unintegrated probability @xmath22 in the whole interval @xmath27 .",
    "here we deal with the matrix element accounting for the gluon virtualities and polarizations . since it is much more complicated than in the pm we consider only the lo of the subprocess @xmath9 which gives the main contribution to the heavy quark production cross section at small @xmath3 , see the diagrams a , b and c in fig .  1 .",
    "the lower and upper ladder blobs present the unintegrating gluon distributions @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the differential cross section of heavy quark hadroproduction has the following form : to be equal to gluon virtuality , which is very close to the blm scheme@xcite ; ( see also @xcite ) . ]",
    "@xmath30 here @xmath31 , @xmath32 are the gluon transverse momenta and @xmath33 are the heavy quark rapidities in the hadron - hadron c.m.s .",
    "frame , @xmath34 @xmath35 is the square of the matrix element for the heavy quark pair hadroproduction .",
    "it is calculated in the born approximation of qcd without standard simplifications of the parton model .",
    "contrary to what is mentioned in @xcite , the transformation jacobian from @xmath36 to @xmath37 is included in our matrix element .",
    "we take @xmath38 for the values of short - distance perturbative quark masses @xcite .",
    "eq .  ( 3 ) enables us to calculate straightforwardly all one - particle distributions as well as correlations between two produced heavy quarks using , say , the vegas code @xcite .",
    "however there exists a principle problem coming from the infrared region .",
    "since the functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 are unknown at small values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , i.e. in nonperturbative domain we calculate separately the contributions from @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath43 @xcite .    the first contribution ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) with the matrix element averaged over directions of the two - dimensional vectors @xmath4 and @xmath5 is exactly the same as the conventional lo parton model expression .",
    "it is multiplied by the survival probability @xmath44 .",
    "( we assume @xmath45 = 1  gev@xmath46 in the following numerical calculations . ) in this contribution the sum of the produced heavy quark transverse momenta is taken to be exactly zero .    the next three contributions ( from the domains where one , or both @xmath47 ) contain the corrections to the parton model matrix element due to gluon polarizations , virtualities and transverse momenta .",
    "their relative contribution strongly depends on the initial energy .",
    "if it is not high enough , the first term dominates , and all results are similar to the conventional lo parton model predictions @xcite . in the case of very high energy the opposite situation takes place , the first term can be considered as a small correction and our results differ from the conventional ones .",
    "so the highest energies are needed to observe ( and to study ) the @xmath0-factorization effects .    in the numerical calculations some uncertainties come from the value of cut - off @xmath48 in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) , ( 2 ) .",
    "in particular , in @xcite we used @xmath49 the angular ordering @xcite implies that the cut - off @xmath50 in this case one gets the non - zero values of @xmath51 even at the large @xmath52 .",
    "this is especially important at the high energies where the essential values of @xmath3 and @xmath53 in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) , ( 2 ) are very small .    from the formal point of view the difference between ( 6 ) and",
    "( 7 ) is beyond the dglap lo accuracy . with the same accuracy we can suggest @xmath54 or something like that .",
    "another source of uncertainties comes from the fact that the unintegrated gluon distributions are not known with the needed accuracy ( from the evolution equation and the experimental data ) .",
    "let us compare the results of our numerical calculations with the data on beauty production at tevatron - collider . in fig .",
    "2a we present the data @xcite on @xmath55 pair production with @xmath56 identified by their muon decays , as the function of @xmath57 at @xmath58 = 1.8  tev .",
    "the curves of different type show the calculated results with different cut - off @xmath48 in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , whereas the upper and lower curves of the same type are obtained with different qcd scales , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the invariant energy of the produced heavy quark pair , @xmath62 .",
    "one can see that the scale dependence is negligible here .",
    "the dependence on the cut - off @xmath48 is more important .",
    "the expressions ( 6 ) ( dash - dotted curves ) and ( 7 ) ( dashed curves ) give too small cross section , whereas the cut - off ( 8) ( dotted curves ) overestimates the data .",
    "we obtain the best agreement with the experiment ( solid curves ) , assuming the cut - off smaller than ( 8) and larger than ( 7 ) , namely @xmath63    the same results for inclusive @xmath64-quark production at large @xmath65 extracted from muon taggeed jets @xcite are presented in fig .",
    ". here again the data are in reasonable agreement with our calculations using eq .",
    "the rapidity distributions of the produced beauty @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "3a , b. they decrease more steeper than our predictions , but the numerical difference is not large .",
    "the correlation between the produced heavy quark and antiquark @xcite which are more sensitive to the dynamics of the production mechanism are presented in fig .  4 . here",
    "the transverse momentum of one beauty quark , @xmath66 , is taken more than some value ( 6.5 gev in fig .",
    "4a and 8.75 gev in fig .",
    "4b ) , and cross sections of second quark production with @xmath67 are presented as the functions of @xmath57 .",
    "again , these data can be described using the cut - off ( 9 ) .",
    "there are the correlations which are more sensitive to the qcd scale value @xmath16 in comparison with the cut - off value .",
    "some examples are presented in fig .  5 , where the distributions over the pair transverse momenta are plotted with the condition that one heavy quark has fixed ( and large ) transverse momentum .",
    "in all cases the shapes of the curves calculated with @xmath59 and @xmath60 are qualitatively different .",
    "the results for the total cross sections of heavy quark production at fnal and lhc are presented in the table .",
    "these cross sections are essentially larger in comparison with the conventional nlo qcd predictions , see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "it can be important for the planning of the experiments at lhc .",

    "the same predictions obtained for the large transverse momenta of both quarks , @xmath696  gev , are also shown .",
    "in the case of high energy heavy quark photoproduction we should consider ( in lo qcd ) two possibilities , direct production in the photon - gluon fusion , @xmath70 , fig .  7 , and the resolved production via quark - gluon structure of the photon .",
    "in the latter case the diagrams are similar to those in fig .  1 , where one proton should be replaced by photon .",
    "the cross section of the direct interaction can be written as @xmath71 \\left(\\frac{\\vec{p}_{1t}}{d_1 } + \\frac{\\vec{q}_t-\\vec{p}_{1t}}{d_2 } \\right ) ^2 + m^2_q \\left(\\frac1{d_1 } - \\frac1{d_2 } \\right ) ^2 \\right\\ } \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 is the electric charge of the produced heavy quark .",
    "the resolved contribution is determined by eq .",
    "( 3 ) , where one of the structure functions @xmath75 describes the partons distribution in the proton and the other stands for the parton distribution in the photon .",
    "the energy dependences of the total cross sections of @xmath76 and @xmath55 photoproduction are presented in fig .",
    "the predictions for the cross sections of charm photoproduction together with the data @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "the averaged cross section value at low energies is taken from @xcite .",
    "the data on beauty photoproduction citeh1 are shown in fig .",
    "the cut - off value ( 9 ) is again in reasonable agreement with the data .",
    "the values ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) give too small cross section , as well as nlo qcd approach @xcite .",
    "these results are in agreement with @xcite , where different assumptions were used .",
    "we can see that the cut - off expression ( 9 ) gives a better agreement with all the presented data in comparison with the other expressions ( 6)-(8 ) .",
    "the @xmath77 dependence of all distributions is rather week except of the special case similar to fig .",
    "so , as a rule , we will present below the results obtained with the cut - off ( 9 ) and @xmath59 only .",
    "the one - particle @xmath65-distributions , @xmath78 , calculated in the @xmath0-factorization approach for hera energy , are presented in fig .",
    "we give separately the sum of direct and resolved contributions , as well as the only resolved ones .",
    "the resolved contributions decrease with @xmath65 more fast , that is connected with the finite phase space value . at very high energies the resolved contributions will decrease more slow .",
    "the predicted rapidity distributions , @xmath79 , of the produced heavy quarks are shown in fig .",
    "10 for all events and for events with @xmath80 6 gev .",
    "the direct production gives the narrow peak in the photon fragmentation region .",
    "this peak moves to the central region when only quarks with high transverse momenta are registrated , that is in agreement with the data @xcite .",
    "the resolved photon contribution dominates in the target fragmentation and partly in the central regions .",
    "the distributions of pair transverse momenta with the condition that one heavy quark has fixed ( and large in comparison with its mass ) transverse momentum are given in fig .",
    "again , as in fig .  5 , the shapes of the curves calculated with @xmath59 and @xmath60 are qualitatively different that allows one to determine the scale value .",
    "the predictions for the azimuthal correlations in heavy quark photoproduction at hera energy are presented in fig .",
    "their dependences on @xmath68 and on the restriction of the minimal transverse momenta of the produced quarks are qualitatively similar to the case of hadroproduction shown in fig .",
    "we have compared the @xmath0-factorization approach for heavy quark hadro- and photoproduction at collider energies with the existing experimental data .",
    "the agreement is reasonable when we take the cut - off ( 9 ) in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) while it does not practically depends on the value of qcd scale @xmath16 in these equations .",
    "we present also predictions which can be used as an additional test of our approach .",
    "let us note that the different expressions for the cut - off @xmath48 result mainly into normalization factor only , so our predictions from @xcite obtained with the cut - off ( 6 ) can be used after renormalization with the cut - off ( 9 ) too .",
    "we hope that future experiments will allow to distinguish between various approaches .",
    "it is necessary to note that the theoretical results concern the heavy quarks rather than experimentally observed hadron production .",
