    "porous media confined into a fluid infinite reservoir , or suffering consolidation loading , can exhibit solid  solid and solid  fluid phase transitions .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . it will be the purpose of this paper to investigate this last transition .",
    "the @xcite three dimensional linear model describes short time pore  fluid segregation , in case of consolidation , only for special geometries of the porous material , a slab @xcite or a sphere @xcite .",
    "the existence of a fluid richer stationary state of the porous medium can not be proven in the context of linear biot theory endowed with darcy solid  fluid viscous coupling .",
    "recently , in - situ observations and experimental studies have pointed out the formation of compaction bands in rocks and soils @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is typically connected with the occurrence of pore  fluid segregation @xcite in consolidation processes and , eventually , soil fluidization @xcite : under the effect of an applied external pressure , or because of gravity , solid internal remodeling can induce the formation of non  connected fluid  filled cavities .",
    "thus increasing the external loading causes fluid to remain trapped and therefore the fluid mass in the trapping chambers to increase with respect to that of the fluid flowing out of the solid matrix .",
    "fluid pressure is now capable to induce unbalance of forces acting on the soil grains , so causing fluidization .    , with respect to the consolidating pressure @xmath1.,width=340 ]",
    "@xcite have experimentally demostrated the existance of two phases in granular materials saturated by a fluid .",
    "a cylindrical perspex test vessel is filled by a granular test sample and water is injected from the bottom through the granular layer . tuning water pressure increases the flow velocity and therefore the upward drag action on the grains . at low flow velocity , when the drag force is smaller than gravity , the standard phase is observed : the fluid flows through the solid which remains undeformed .",
    "when the velocity is increased another phase shows up : the drag force balances gravity and fluidization of the grains occurs .",
    "the aim of this paper is to model solid  fluid phase transition describing in particular the showing up of a pore  fluid segregating state , when a consolidating external pressure is applied to the porous material . for this pourpose",
    "we use a simple one  dimensional model , generalizing the biot theory , where the phase transition is achieved modifing the standard biot internal energy functional .",
    "a suitable potential energy including the effects of the external pressure @xmath1 will be considered .",
    "also in this model the free energy depends on two fields , the deformation @xmath2 of the porous matrix and the density of the fluid @xmath3 , measured with respect to the solid reference volume .",
    "we shall describe the following phase transition : there exists @xmath4 such that for @xmath5 , that is _ low pressure _ , there exists a single stationary state with fluid mass @xmath6 and solid deformation @xmath7 ; while for @xmath8 , that is _ high pressure _ , a second phase @xmath9 appears .",
    "fluid density @xmath10 is greater than @xmath11 and increases with the pressure @xmath1 , see fig [ figintro ] .",
    "the first solution corresponds to the case when the fluid is not confined inside the matrix and can flow freely back and forth from the inside to the outside of the solid . at equilibrium the density of the internal fluid equals that of the external infinite reservoir or , in other words the pore of the solid matrix are connected .",
    "the second solution , on the other hand , corresponds to the case when the mass density of the fluid is not that of the fluid in the external reservoir .",
    "this is due to the fact that the porous material starts to behave as a closed system rather than an open system , as the pore connecting ducts become thinner and thinner .",
    "this point can be supported by means of a thermodynamic argument : the flow of the liquid back and forth from the inside to the outside of the porous medium is a thermodynamic transformation at constant temperature , pressure , and volume , typical of open systems . the equilibrium is achieved when the internal gibbs free energy @xmath12 equals the external one ; if the infinitesimal mass @xmath13 of fluid exits the matrix , the mass outside will vary of the amount @xmath14 . since the infinitesimal variation of the internal and the external gibbs free energy",
    "are given by @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively , where @xmath0 is the chemical potential of the fluid , we have that at equilibrium @xmath17 implies @xmath18 .",
    "recalling that @xmath19 , with @xmath20 the internal energy of the fluid , for reasonable choices of the function @xmath20 , we have that the equality of the internal and external chemical potential reflects into the equality of the internal and external fluid density .    it is quite natural that , supposed to limit our discussion to small values of the external pressure , the deformation of the solid is grossly proportional to the external pressure @xmath1 , namely , @xmath21 for some positive constant @xmath22 ( recall that for a compressed solid matrix the deformation is negative ) . in the unique low pressure phase , since as a consequence of the pressure @xmath1 some liquid will exit the solid , we suppose that @xmath23 decreases proportionally to @xmath1 . concerning the second phase @xmath24",
    ", the only constraint will be @xmath25 . indeed in this phase",
    "we guess the solid structure is modified and room for some liquid is made .    in spite of the appealing simplicity of these arguments",
    ", it turns out that the actual situation is complex to be studied .",
    "the first goal is to understand basic physical phenomena and to determine how phase transition in question is affected by the external pressure .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we describe the generalized biot model and introduce the free energy functional . in  3 , via an analytical minimization of the functional , we study the stationary points and their character .",

    "this description of the kinematics of the fluid is completely consistent with the eulerean point of view adopted in standard fluid mechanics : the focus is not on the placement of the fluid particles , but on the particle , which at time @xmath34 , occupies the current place @xmath39 . as a consequence the reference configuration of the solid @xmath40 , which in the following will be the _ the reference configuration of the system _ , is assumed to be a known subdomain of @xmath27 , while the one of the fluid , @xmath38 , is unknown , to be determined by the map @xmath36 . as usual also the current configuration of",

    "increasing @xmath88 , keeping @xmath89 fixed , implies the critical pressure to increase and therefore the phase transition to occur for higher values of the consolidating pressure .",
    "indeed increasing @xmath88 means increasing of the bulk modulus of the fluid ; the inverse of biot s modulus is an affine function of the inverse of the fluid bulk modulus , with respect to that of the solid .",
    "the fluid becomes more stiff and therefore does not allow the applied external pressure to force shrinkage of the ducts inside the porous medium ; as a consequence flowing of the fluid out of the solid matrix is enhanced .",
    "increasing @xmath89 , keeping @xmath88 fixed , on the other hand , implies the critical pressure to descrease and therefore the phase transition to occur for lower levels of the consolidating loading .",
    "this is due to the fact that increasing @xmath89 enhances solid  fluid coupling .",
    "apparently no physical reasoning can be developed in order to discuss the behavior of the system when tuning @xmath67 , however it is clear that only for sufficiently high values of this parameter phase transition can be appreciated .",
