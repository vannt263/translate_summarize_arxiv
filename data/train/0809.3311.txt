    "the start - up of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern will shed lights on a long standing puzzle in particle physics , the secret of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "a hidden sector can be a good answer for ewsb . in a minimal extension , the hidden sector scalar couples to the standard model ( sm ) scalar field in a scale - invariant way @xcite .",
    "quantum loop corrections break the scale invariance , and the scalar field achieves the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) through the coleman - weinberg ( cw ) mechanism @xcite .",
    "recently the hidden sector has received much attention with the possibility of the existence of unparticles @xcite .",
    "the unparticle is a scale invariant stuff in a hidden sector .",
    "its interactions with the sm particles are well described by an effective theory formalism .",
    "the most striking feature of the unparticle is its unusual phase space with non - integral scaling dimension @xmath0 . for an unparticle operator of scaling dimension @xmath0",
    ", the unparticle appears as a non - integral number @xmath0 of invisible massless particles . after the georgi s suggestion",
    ", there have been a lot of phenomenological studies on unparticles @xcite .    among other couplings between sm fields and unparticles ,",
    "higgs - unparticle interaction is very interesting because its coupling , @xmath1 , is relevant @xcite . here",
    "@xmath2 is a fundamental higgs , @xmath3 is a scalar unparticle operator with scaling dimension @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the coupling constant .",
    "this work is motivated by the observation that the scalar unparticle operator @xmath3 is _ equivalent _ to @xmath0 number of massless particles @xcite .",
    "this feature of unparticle operator coupled with higgs sector is already pointed out in the literature @xcite .",
    "we propose a new type of scalar potential @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a massless scalar field with @xmath8=1 $ ] .",
    "when one considers the scalar potential containing the form of @xmath9 , it inevitably introduces a mass scale through the dimensionful coupling .",
    "one may expect that there is a nontrivial minimum along the radial direction _ at tree level _ for @xmath10 .",
    "the main result of this work is that this is indeed the case .",
    "in other words , interactions between the sm fields and unparticle sector themselves break the electroweak symmetry .",
    "after the ewsb occurs one expands the scalar fields around the vacuum . the resulting fluctuations mix up with each other to form two physical scalar states .",
    "in this simple setup , it is quite natural to identify a heavy state as higgs .",
    "the other light state has a mass proportional to @xmath11 which vanishes as @xmath12 .",
    "this is the remnant of the fact that @xmath13 has a massless scalar at tree level as a pseudo goldstone boson from the conformal symmetry breaking .",
    "the unparticle sector thus no longer remains scale - invariant after the ewsb .",
    "so the interaction @xmath9 induces _ both _ ewsb in the sm sector and the scale - invariance breaking in the unparticle sector .",
    "we find that all of these things can happen for acceptable values of the parameters of this setup .    in the earlier works of @xcite , the ewsb with unparticles",
    "was considered in the context of deconstruction @xcite .",
    "but the scalar potential of @xcite contains only the usual polynomials of the fields .",
    "the unusual scaling behavior of the unparticle was encoded in the deconstructed version of the unparticle decay constant , while in this work it is simplified with the fractional power of the fields .",
    "we find that the ewsb conditions on the parameters here are rather stronger , and the predicted new scalar particle is always lighter than the higgs boson .",
    "recently it was proposed that the unparticles are gauged to become a higgs @xcite .",
    "this `` unhiggs '' can also break ews and unitarize @xmath14 scattering .",
    "the proposed scalar potential has the form of @xmath15 where @xmath16 is assumed to be positive . here",
    "the mass dimension of @xmath7 is @xmath17 and a dimension-1 parameter @xmath18 is inserted to make @xmath19 dimensionless .",
    "the minimum of @xmath20 lies along some ray @xmath21 @xcite , where @xmath22 is a unit vector in the field space @xmath23 . in unitary gauge , the fields are parameterized as @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "the scalar potential becomes @xmath26~,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "the stationary condition for @xmath20 along the @xmath29 direction for some specific unit vector @xmath30 , @xmath31 , combined with the normalization of @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , gives @xmath34 one can easily find that the minimum of @xmath35 occurs at @xmath36    it should be noted that when @xmath37 , @xmath38 goes to @xmath39 or infinity depending on the values of @xmath40 and @xmath41 . since the vacuum expectation value of @xmath42 is directly proportional to the mass scale of the theory ( e.g. , gauge boson masses , higgs masses , etc . ) , it is not desirable if @xmath38 gets too small or too large for @xmath37 .",
    "we require that @xmath38 is stable for @xmath37 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "a little algebra shows that this requirement is satisfied if @xmath44    when @xmath45 are turned on , the potential @xmath20 develops the vev @xmath46 at @xmath47 and the fields @xmath2 and @xmath7 get fluctuations @xmath48 and @xmath49 around @xmath46 .",
    "the scalar potential now becomes @xmath50 the mass squared matrix @xmath51 where @xmath52 , gives two eigenvalues of @xmath53 corresponding to the heavy and light scalar mass squared respectively : @xmath54 where @xmath55    when @xmath56 , the light scalar is massless at tree level .",
    "the reason is that it corresponds to the pseudo goldstone boson from the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the conformal symmetry @xcite .",
    "but for @xmath57 , we have found that @xmath58 at tree level .",
    "thus the new light scalar and higgs boson masses are good probes to the hidden unparticle sector .",
    "the vacuum expectation value @xmath38 is related to the gauge boson ( @xmath59 ) masses as @xmath60 from the value of @xmath38 and @xmath19 , one has @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ vhat0 ] ) is a slow varying function of @xmath0 .",
    "if one chooses @xmath63 , the ratios of couplings are @xmath64 when @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "since the ratios are of order 1 for all range over @xmath0 , the scale of @xmath18 around the weak scale is a reasonable choice .",
    "scalar masses @xmath68 and @xmath69 as a function of @xmath0 for @xmath70 0.1 , 0.2 , @xmath71 , 1.0 , from bottom to top .",
    "]    as given in fig .",
    "[ mass ] , @xmath68 is rather inert with respect to @xmath0 while @xmath69 is not . with the condition of eq .",
    "( [ fixratio ] ) , both @xmath72 are proportional to @xmath73",
    ". one can find that @xmath74 for @xmath75 . if the scalar masses turned out to be quite different from eq .",
    "( [ massrange ] ) , then the value of @xmath18 should be rearranged to fit the data .",
    "but in this case one would have to explain why that value of @xmath18 is so different from @xmath76 , the electroweak scale .",
    "in this talk we suggest a new scalar potential with a fractional power of fields from hidden sector inspired by the scalar unparticle operator . unlike the usual potential of marginal coupling , the new one develops vev at tree level . in this picture",
    ", the ewsb occurs when the unparticle sector begins to interact with the sm sector .",
    "when the scaling dimension @xmath0 departs from the value of @xmath77 a new scale ( of the order of @xmath78 ) is introduced in the scalar potential through the relevant coupling , and the electroweak symmetry is broken at tree level . in other words , the ewsb occurs when the hidden sector enters the regime of scale invariance , i.e. , unparticles . in view of the unparticle sector , the new potential also breaks the scale invariance of the hidden sector .    once the electroweak symmetry is broken , the scalar fields from sm and hidden sector mix together to form two massive physical states .",
    "the heavy one is identified as higgs , while the light one is a new particle of mass around @xmath79 gev .",
    "it might be that the latter be soon discovered at the lhc .",
