    "in the recent intense activity that has focused on complex networks @xcite-@xcite ,  one goal has been to identify properties of networks that are important for their function and behavior .",
    "a number of concepts have been introduced for classifying network structures , for example degree distribution , path length@xcite , clustering@xcite , the small - world property@xcite@xcite , modularity , betweenness@xcite , etc .",
    "diagnostic tools for assessing function include percolation properties , robustness against node or link deletion@xcite , studies of epidemic spreading@xcite , and various measures of synchronizabilty .",
    "synchronization can be approached by means of global order parameters@xcite@xcite or stability analyses of fully synchronized@xcite or fully incoherent@xcite@xcite states , which give thresholds for the onset of either synchronization or desynchronization .",
    "one way of distilling information about a network is to analyze the eigenvalue and eigenvector spectra of matrices associated with the network , and that is the focus of this paper .",
    "such spectral properties provide an important intermediary between structural and dynamical properties .",
    "they are derived directly from the network topology and many relations exist between particular eigenvalues and important network structural properties@xcite@xcite@xcite , while a number of studies have related extremal eigenvalues to dynamical properties and thresholds.@xcite@xcite in the current paper we use spectral tools to diagnose the dynamics of partial synchronization , between the incoherent and fully coherent states .    the important matrices are derived from either the adjacency or coupling matrix .",
    "the adjacency matrix @xmath0 is defined by @xmath1 if a connection exists between the nodes numbered @xmath2 and @xmath3 and @xmath4 otherwise .",
    "the coupling matrix @xmath5 is simply the matrix of coupling strengths among nodes ,  and if the links are all equally weighted then it is a multiple of the adjacency matrix .",
    "several definitions of the laplacian matrix are in use .",
    "we will define it here as@xmath6 in the case where @xmath7 , this matrix is sometimes known as the `` combinatorial laplacian.''@xcite  the definitions and significance of these matrices will be discussed further in the following sections .",
    "some applications of network matrices depend only on one or two extremal eigenvalues .",
    "a widely known application of the laplacian matrix is the master stability function ( msf ) technique for analyzing the stability of  a synchronized state of coupled oscillators.@xcite  for the msf ,  the quantity of interest is the ratio of the largest to the smallest nonzero eigenvalue of the laplacian , and accordingly many studies of the laplacian spectrum on complex networks are limited to tabulations of this ratio .  in mathematical graph theory ,",
    "a number of theorems relate geometrical properties such as the diameter of the network to the smallest nonzero eigenvalue@xcite .",
    "likewise with the adjacency matrix , for some applications it is only the largest eigenvalue that matters .",
    "for example , under certain assumptions , approximate relations were derived between the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix and the critical coupling strength for the onset of phase synchronization in a network of limit cycle oscillators.@xcite    in many cases , however , there is additional important information contained in the full spectrum and in the eigenvectors themselves .",
    "the laplacian spectrum , for example , is relevant to the solution of diffusion and flow problems on networks @xcite .",
    "apart from the msf formalism ,  it is applicable more generally to the dynamics of coupled oscillators near the synchronized state ,  including the relaxation of coupled identical limit - cycle oscillators to equilibrium.@xcite  in a previous paper @xcite , we showed that the eigenvectors of the laplacian form a useful coordinate system in which to view the dynamics of partly synchronized networks of oscillators ,  even at a significant distance from full synchronization .",
    "there have been relatively few efforts to study the full spectrum of the laplacian as defined in ( [ ldef1 ] ) for general complex networks .  in the mathematical literature , more attention",
    "has often been paid to the adjacency matrix@xcite or the so - called `` normalized laplacian''@xcite@xcite which is related to @xmath8 but can have a quite different spectrum .",
    "studies of the combinatorial laplacian@xcite are not often focused on applications to large complex networks .",
    "there have been some numerical and analytical studies of the adjacency matrices of complex networks@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite as well as some studies of the normalized laplacian@xcite and of the closely related `` transition matrix''@xcite on one category of random uncorrelated networks with given expected degree distributions . as for the laplacian defined in ( [ ldef1 ] ) ,  its full spectrum has been examined on random erdos - renyi @xcite and small - world networks@xcite but much of the territory is still relatively uncharted , especially in the case of networks with degree correlations , clustering , communities , and other types of correlations .",
    "the current paper explores the information contained in the laplacian spectrum , and the three - way linkage among network topology , spectrum and dynamics , in particular oscillator synchronization dynamics .",
    "one goal is simply to characterize the laplacian eigenvalues and eigenvectors for several important types of networks .",
    "we  pay attention to the spectral and dynamical effects of network topological properties such as degree distribution ( especially poisson vs. scale - free or homogeneous vs. heterogeneous ) , clustering ( i.e. , the tendency of neighbors of a given node to form links with each other ) , and community structure , also known as modularity .",
    "while recent studies of network matrix spectra have dealt with random network models without correlations ,  modularity and clustering represent significant new ingredients .",
    "in addition ,  we consider weighting and symmetry or asymmetry of connection strengths , especially the asymmetric connection scheme in which the total input to each node is normalized .",
    "we are interested in the latter coupling scheme because it is known to optimize synchronizability in msf terms .",
    "@xcite@xcite    beyond the mere classification of spectra , another goal is to understand dynamics .  for the types of networks studied , we consider the synchronization dynamics of coupled phase oscillators ( the kuramoto@xcite model ) , using coordinates based on the laplacian eigenbasis as a tool for visualizing the dynamics and revealing structure within the synchronization transition .",
    "this program follows the general inspiration of the msf technique in that the aim is to use the laplacian spectrum to isolate topological influences on synchronization , as distinct from the individual node dynamics .",
    "the msf , however ,  is strictly applicable only to the stability problem of a fully synchronized state of a set of exactly identical oscillators .",
    "it is most useful for networks of identical chaotic oscillators .  for appropriately limited questions",
    ", the msf , relying only the eigenratio , gives rigorous answers .",
    "the present work , on the other hand ,  seeks rather more heuristic tools for much broader questions .",
    "we consider non - identical oscillators and we consider the process of synchronization from its onset up to nearly complete synchronization ,  rather than being limited to the immediate neighborhood of the synchronization manifold .",
    "the current paper follows a brief report@xcite in which a subset of our results was presented .",
    "we expand on those results here by studying a greater variety and larger sample of networks and by examining properties of the individual eigenvectors such as localization and degree bias .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows :  section [ lproperties ] discusses some general properties of the laplacian matrix that are relevant to network dynamics .",
    "section [ spectra ] is devoted to a description of particular network laplacian eigenvalue spectra and their dependence on topological properties .  in section",
    "[ shapes ] we then consider some properties of the eigenvectors themselves , especially localization and degree bias .",
    "finally , in section [ dynamics ] , we examine some connections between spectra and dynamics in the case of a network version of the kuramoto model .",
    "a coordinate system for phase space based on the laplacian eigenvectors proves useful for obtaining a geometric picture of the oscillators dynamical behavior .  under some conditions ,",
    "groups of eigenvectors behave as dynamically independent degrees of freedom and  the process of synchronization amounts to a contraction of phase space onto progressively lower - dimensional submanifolds spanned by lower - eigenvalue eigenvectors .",
    "the concluding section [ conclusions ] summarizes our results and suggests some future directions .",
    "we begin by reviewing and extending some known general properties of the laplacian of a network of @xmath9 nodes .",
    "we denote the @xmath9-component eigenvectors and associated eigenvalues respectively by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , so that @xmath12 from the definition ( [ ldef1 ] ) it follows that the sum of matrix elements in any row is zero , and consequently the constant vector @xmath13 is always an eigenvector with eigenvalue zero .",
    "if the coupling matrix is symmetric ( @xmath14 ) then so is the laplacian , and therefore all eigenvalues are real and eigenvectors corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal .",
    "the trace of @xmath8 is given by @xmath15 ( from now on ,  limits of summations are suppressed and assumed to be from 1 to @xmath9 unless otherwise indicated . )  if self - couplings are excluded , then the final term vanishes as @xmath16 .  if , furthermore ,  @xmath7 ( i.e. , all couplings equally weighted ) then the row sum of @xmath17 is just the degree ( or number of neighbors ) of each node , and so @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the degree of the @xmath2th node .",
    "some authors ( e.g. , @xcite )  define the quantity @xmath20 as the `` degree '' even when the couplings @xmath5 are not only zeros and ones .",
    "however , it is useful to be able to distinguish the sum of couplings from the actual number of nodes to which a given node is connected .  in cases of possible confusion",
    ", we suggest the term `` topological degree '' for the latter , and following the nomenclature of ref .",
    "@xcite , we use `` intensity '' to refer to the sum of input coupling strengths",
    ".  for general couplings , ( [ traceid ] ) remains valid if the degree is replaced by the intensity .",
    "this means that the average of the laplacian eigenvalues is equal to the average degree ( or intensity ) @xmath21 for the whole network , and consequently @xmath21 is a convenient scaling factor for comparing spectra of different networks . is not well - defined , such as the thermodynamic limit of scale - free networks with small power - law exponents .  ]",
    "a useful identity is the following:@xmath22 where @xmath23 may be any quantity associated with each node ( in the context of synchronization , it could be the phase of each oscillator ) .",
    "the above guarantees that , as long as the couplings are non - negative , then the laplacian is positive semi - definite ; i.e. ,  all of its eigenvalues are positive or zero .",
    "if @xmath23 represents a perturbation of some dynamical degree of freedom ( such as the phase of an oscillator ) then ( [ lapdiffid ] ) suggests a heuristic interpretation of @xmath8 as a tensor expressing the rigidity of the network against such perturbations .  in particular , if the perturbation is a multiple of one of the normalized eigenvectors , or in other words if@xmath24 then@xmath25 the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ lapdiffeigenvectorid ] ) is a sum of squared differences across links , weighted by the strength of each link ; it can be imagined as a sum of potential energies due to stretched bonds .",
    "if the eigenvalue @xmath11 is small , then the perturbation along the corresponding vector can occur without disturbing very many strong bonds , and the opposite is true if @xmath11 is large .  with this interpretation in mind",
    ", the zero mode @xmath13 indicates the freedom of a uniform translation of the whole network ( in the case of coupled oscillators , it is the freedom to reset all phases by an equal amount without affecting any links . )     the definition ( [ ldef1 ] )  shows a deceptively simple relationship between the adjacency ( or coupling ) matrix and the laplacian .  however , it is only in the special case of a so - called _ regular network _",
    "( i.e. , one in which the degree or the sum @xmath26 is the same for all @xmath2 ) ,  that the two matrices commute and thus are guaranteed to share a common eigenbasis .  in this special case ,  the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath11 for the laplacian and @xmath27 for the coupling matrix",
    "are related by @xmath28 .  in general ,  it is easy to show that the commutator@xmath29   \\equiv\\mathbf{wl - lw } \\label{commutator}%\\ ] ] is a matrix whose elements are proportional to the differences between the degrees of adjacent nodes .",
    "this leads us to expect that the differences in spectrum between the two matrices become more important as the network becomes more heterogeneous ,  but on the other hand can be lessened by what is called assortative mixing@xcite ( i.e. , a tendency of nodes to connect with other nodes of similar degree . )",
    "in this section we examine the shapes of the laplacian spectra of several types of networks , and consider how specific features of the spectra are correlated with structural features of the networks .",
    "we will begin with networks in which all existing links are bidirectional and equally weighted , and then consider certain types of asymmetries .  except where otherwise indicated , the networks we study have @xmath30 nodes and average topological degree @xmath31 .  figures [ combhist ] a , b show histograms of the ( scaled ) laplacian eigenvalue distributions for random ( erdos - renyi @xcite ) networks with poisson degree distribution ( henceforth referred to as a poisson network or pn ) and barabasi - albert@xcite networks with scale - free distribution ( a scale - free network or sfn ) .  the first thing to note",
    "is the dependence of the spectrum on the degree distribution .",
    "the eigenvalue distributions share some statistical features of the degree distributions : for example , the eigenvalue spectrum of the sfn has a power - law tail just as does the degree distribution .  for the poisson networks ,",
    "on the other hand , the spectrum has a poisson - like single peak with no significant tail .",
    "when we varied @xmath21 from 5 to 40 ( plots are not shown here ) , we found that the relative width ( or width scaled by @xmath21 ) of this peak decreases with increasing @xmath21 but that other qualitative features are the same .",
    "[ ptb ]    combhist.eps    we next examine the effect of clustering , which is known to have strong effects on the synchronizability of networks.@xcite  we applied a stochastic rewiring algorithm @xcite@xciteto increase the clustering coefficient of the pn and sfn while leaving the degree distributions unchanged .",
    "clustering ( also called transitivity ) refers to the tendency of two nodes which share a common neighbor to have an increased likelihood of also being directly connected to each other ( compared to two nodes that do not share a neighbor)@xcite .",
    "put another way , clustering indicates the prevalence of triangles in the network topology .",
    "the clustering coefficient @xmath32 , a numerical measure of clustering , is defined as an average over the network of the local clustering coefficient , given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the number of mutual connections among the neighbors of a given node ,  @xmath35 is the number of neighbors , and @xmath36  is the number of possible pairs of neighbors that could potentially be connected .",
    "the bottom row of plots in figure [ combhist ] show the spectra of networks with the same degree distributions as the ones above , but with high clustering coefficients , specifically @xmath37 for the pn s and @xmath38 for the sfn s .  for the `` natural '' low - clustering networks whose spectra are in the upper row of figure [ combhist ] ,  the values are within the range @xmath39 for the pn s and @xmath40 for the sfn s .",
    "it is apparent that for both the pn and sfn , increasing the clustering changes the shape of main spectrum slightly , sharpening the peak and shifting it to the right ,  while also creating a new group of eigenvalues close to zero .",
    "a series of plots at intermediate values of @xmath32 ( not given here ) shows that as @xmath32 increases , this group of eigenvalues breaks away from the main peak and gradually migrates downward toward zero .",
    "the presence of near - zero eigenvalues generally indicates the existence of strong communities ,  or nearly disconnected components .",
    "the multiplicity of the ( exactly ) zero eigenvalue is equal to the number of disconnected components @xcite .",
    "strong communities ( subsets of nodes with much fewer connections between groups than within groups )  behave like nearly disconnected components and thus result in small but nonzero eigenvalues .",
    "low eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors have been used in some algorithms for partitioning and/or detection of communities .",
    "the most common application is to find an optimal partitioning of the network into two communities by means of the eigenvector corresponding to the second - lowest ( or lowest non - zero ) eigenvalue , a procedure which may be applied iteratively.@xcite  more recently , however ,  techniques for finding communities have made use of the space spanned by the lowest few eigenvectors rather than only one.@xcite@xcite  the essential technique is as follows :  the @xmath41 eigenvectors with the lowest nonzero eigenvalues are found ,  and each node is assigned @xmath41 coordinates which are the entries of the @xmath41 eigenvectors at the position of that node .",
    "when these coordinates are plotted for all nodes ,  communities , if they exist ,  appear as groups of nodes clumped together in this @xmath41-dimensional space .",
    "the clumps may be readily observable by eye ;  alternatively , one may use statistical techniques such as hierarchical clustering@xcite to find the optimal grouping into clumps .",
    "we have made such a plot for the first three eigenvectors of the high- and low - clustering sfn s in fig .",
    "[ donettiplots ] .",
    "the plot clearly shows that the nodes of the high - clustering network group together into communities while those of the low - clustering network do not .  in examining synchronization dynamics in section",
    "[ dynamics ] , the low - lying eigenvectors will give a good indication of the dynamical importance of communities .",
    "in view of the interpretation of @xmath8 as giving the network s inherent rigidity against perturbations ,  the low - lying eigenvectors associated with communities reflect the relative ease with which the network can fall apart ( or desynchronize ) along community boundaries .",
    "[ ptb ]    sfdonettiplots.eps    although in network studies it it most common to consider networks with symmetric , undirected links ,  motter et al . @xcite@xcite",
    "have shown for a variety of topologies that the msf synchronizability as measured by the eigenratio @xmath42 is improved by a particular scheme of asymmetric coupling which we refer to here as input normalization or simply _",
    "normalization_.  this is a weighting in which the input coupling strengths to any node are scaled so that their sum is unity .",
    "put another way ,  the coupling matrix is derived by dividing each row of the adjacency matrix by the degree of the corresponding node:@xmath43 in a heterogeneous network , this implies that the couplings are not symmetric .",
    "if a hub node h with high degree is connected to a peripheral node p with low degree , then the influence of h on p is greater in absolute terms than that of p on h.  p s influence on h is diluted by h s many other neighbors .  motivated by the enhanced synchronizability of normalized networks ,  we are interested in understanding the effect of normalization on the full laplacian spectrum ( and subsequently on dynamics ) ,  not only the extremal eigenvalues .",
    "in spite of the asymmetry introduced into the coupling and therefore the laplacian , it can be proved @xcite that the laplacian eigenvalues are still all real in this case .  furthermore , the intensities of all nodes are unity ,  so that , as discussed above ,  the laplacian has a common eigenbasis with the coupling matrix .",
    "( due to the asymmetry , however , the eigenvectors are not mutually orthogonal . )",
    "the eigenvalue spectrum is in fact the same as for what is known in graph theory as the `` normalized laplacian , '' @xcite@xcite of the underlying unweighted network , although the eigenvectors themselves are not the same .  to summarize the relationships among the matrices , let @xmath44 be the diagonal matrix whose entries are the topological degrees , let @xmath45 and @xmath46 be the laplacians of the unnormalized and normalized networks repectively , while @xmath47 is the symmetric `` normalized laplacian . ''",
    "then the relationships are : @xmath48    figure [ combhistn ] shows eigenvalue histograms for the same networks as in figure [ combhist ] , but with the inputs normalized .",
    "the first striking feature is that the spectra look very nearly the same for both the pn and the sfn .",
    "as was found in @xcite , the effect of degree heterogeneity is greatly suppressed by normalization ;  we will see that this is also true of the effect of degree distribution on dynamics .",
    "in the low clustering case , the spectra have approximately semicircular shapes for both networks ,  recalling the so - called semicircle law@xcite for spectra of random matrices .",
    "previously , the normalized laplacians of a broad class of uncorrelated random matrices ( including the erdos - renyi but not , strictly speaking , the barabasi - albert network ) were found to obey the semicircle law@xcite , as were the closely related transition matrices@xcite .",
    "consistent with what is known about the eigenratio@xcite ,  the spectra are much narrower than for the unnormalized networks ,  with no apparent tail either of the exponential or power - law type .     increasing the clustering of the normalized networks narrows and markedly sharpens the main spectral peak into a more triangular shape .",
    "the other main effect of clustering , namely the creation of a second peak near zero ,  is much the same as in the unnormalized networks .",
    "this is consistent with our understanding of the low modes as being associated with community structure .",
    "communities are a topological phenomenon ,  the result of a paucity of connections among the different subsets .",
    "if there are only a few connections between two subsets of the network , then an adjustment of coupling _ strengths _ alone is unlikely to compensate significantly for this scarcity , unless some bias results in extra strengthening of inter - community ties at the expense of others .",
    "input normalization certainly alters the dynamical roles of high- vs. low - degree nodes , but it is not surprising that it has little effect on such global topological features as community formation .    [ ptb ]    combhistn.eps",
    "to the extent that different laplacian eigenvectors are associated with collective degrees of freedom having different dynamical functions ,  it is interesting to examine the `` shapes '' of these vectors and understand how they relate to the network s structure .  in figure [ vectorexamples ] , we plot the components @xmath49 of several representative eigenvectors against the node index @xmath2 where the nodes have been sorted from lowest to highest degree .",
    "while all plots appear partly random , reflecting the randomness in the network s structure ,  there are nonetheless patterns that are clear from a visual inspection , and clear qualitative differences between different vectors .",
    "some vectors , such as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ vectorexamples]b ,  are highly localized , with only a few large nonzero components and the rest nearly zero , while others such as the one in frame a have nonzero components spread throughout the whole network .",
    "some , such as c or d ,  show a degree bias ;  most of their large components occur at nodes within a certain degree range ( either high , low or intermediate ) .",
    "the vector in e is an example of one of the low - lying modes in a strongly clustered network .",
    "the components cluster around a small number of discrete values .",
    "nodes having the same value of @xmath50 are likely to belong to the same community .",

    "we first define the model and show how the laplacian and its spectrum appear naturally in a linearized description of the frequency - synchronized state ,  and then we proceed to use the laplacian eigenvectors to parametrize the partially desynchronized states , showing that this coordinate system remains useful well beyond the range of validity of the linearization and that individual modes may behave as quasi - independent degreess of freedom .",

    "this effect , noted previously in @xcite  and confirmed by finite size scaling analysis@xcite is apparent in the early upward turn in the order parameter curve at @xmath80  it was found previously that it is the highest - degree nodes which synchronize first .",
    "this advanced partial synchronization disappears , however , in the case of normalized inputs .",
    "since the advanced synchronization is associated with a special behavior of the high - degree nodes ,  its disappearance is consistent with the general observation that input normalization greatly reduces the effects of degree heterogeneity .",
    "[ ptb ]    orderpar.eps    in @xcite it was shown that nodes in different parts of the degree distribution can play different dynamical roles : for example ,  in the case of the sfn it is the hubs ( high - degree nodes ) that synchronize first .",
    "a complementary way of viewing the synchronization dynamics is to examine it in terms of appropriately chosen collective degrees of freedom rather than the behavior of individual oscillators .  here as in @xcite ,",
    "we define collective coordinates by means of projections onto eigenvectors of the laplacian .",
    "we define projections of the phase and frequency vectors onto these eigenvectors by @xmath81  the _ normal coordinates _  @xmath82 are the appropriate ones for describing the relaxation to equilibrium of a strongly synchronized system @xcite@xcite .",
    "in addition , we define the observed frequencies ( rotation numbers ) of the oscillators as the time averages@xmath83 projecting the vector of observed frequencies onto the laplacian eigenbasis gives a time - averaged velocity along the direction defined by each eigenvector:@xmath84 for the purpose of elucidating the network dynamics ,  we found these _ normal velocities _",
    "more useful to work with than the normal coordinates themselves for two reasons .",
    "first ,  from a computational point of view ,  it is easier to construct time averages of the velocities as one requires only initial and final phases ( not modulo 2@xmath85 for this purpose ) together with the elapsed time .",
    "second , we found that plots of the velocities as functions of coupling strength displayed sharper transitions and clearer patterns than averages ( or mean squares ) of coordinates .",
    "[ ptb ]    partialdisorder.eps    figure  [ partialdisorder ] shows plots of the mean square velocities @xmath86 as functions of coupling strength @xmath72 for four different values of @xmath87 taken from different parts of the spectrum for a highly clsutered poisson network .",
    "the time averages @xmath88 were taken over an interval of 300 time units and the squares were averaged over 100 realizations of the random frequencies .",
    "the different @xmath86 values fall to zero at different rates , so that the eigendirections associated with high eigenvalues become locked ( i.e. , the corresponding velocities become zero ) at lower values of @xmath72 than the ones associated with low eigenvalues .",
    "similar trends were noted for sfn s in @xcite .",
    "the normal velocites give more detailed information about synchronization than a global order parameter .  the evolution with increasing @xmath72 from complete incoherence to complete frequency synchronization",
    "can be visualized as a series of quasi - independent locking transitions in which different normal modes effectively drop out of the active dynamics .",
    "as eigendirections successively lock ,  the phase space of the oscillator system can be viewed as contracting onto progressively lower - dimensional subspaces spanned by the remaining eigenvectors .",
    "modes with very low eigenvalues are very difficult to lock , and therefore their presence will inhibit complete synchronization .  evidently these low modes are correlated with the difficulty of full synchronization in highly clustered networks .     to the extent that the modes behave as independent degrees of freedom",
    ", one can view each mode as having its own individual transition point ,  a critical coupling strength above which that mode is locked .  to obtain numerical estimates of these individual transitions , we considered a mode to be locked when the value of @xmath86 falls below a threshold of 0.01 .",
    "( since we are measuring an average over frequency realizations , this means that for the majority of realizations the value of @xmath88 is actually zero within the resolution of our numerical measurement . )",
    "frequencies were measured at a sequence of values of @xmath72 for one network of each of the types we studied .  as in figure [ partialdisorder ]",
    "the frequencies @xmath88 were time averaged over 300 time units , and their squares were averaged over 100 realizations of the random intrinsic frequencies .",
    "the transition points @xmath89 were estimated by means of a cubic spline interpolation of the numerical measurements .",
    "the results are plotted in figures [ transitionsu ] and [ transitionsn ] .",
    "the patterns are somewhat different for each type of network , but as a general rule @xmath89 is a decreasing function of the eigenvalue @xmath90 .  in some of the networks ,  a finite subset of the modes all lock at the same @xmath72 value while the remainder lock and unlock independently .",
    "evidently , some modes are strongly mutually coupled while others are more independent .  for the strongly clustered sfn , for example ,",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ transitionsu ] that a number of high modes lock simultaneously at a quite low value of @xmath91 .",
    "this group of modes apparently represent the degrees of freedom responsible for the advanced partial synchronization of this network and the upward turn in the global order parameter in fig .",
    "[ orderparam ] .  for the normalized networks ,  all modes within the main spectral peak lock almost simultaneously ,  and only the lower set of modes ( in highly clustered networks ) have significant spread in their values of @xmath89 .",
    "the low - eigenvalue modes that form at high clustering are difficult to lock , and it is evidently these modes that are responsible for the inhibition of complete synchronization in the cases of highly clustered neworks .",
    "since these modes are associated with the divisions among communities ,  this suggests that the frequency clusters noted at moderately high @xmath72 in @xcite are identical to topological communities .",
    "the degrees of freedom that inhibit full synchronization are clearly different from the ones responsible for the advanced partial synchronization of sfn s .",
    "[ ptb ]    transitionsu.eps    [ ptbptb ]    transitionsn.eps",
    "we have examined the laplacian spectra for several types of complex networks ,  seeing the effects on the spectra of degree distribution , clustering , and of coupling scheme ( in particular , equal and bidirectional couplings versus input normalization . )",
    "we found that increasing clustering has two main groups of effects on the eigenvalue spectrum .",
    "the first set of effects alter the shape and composition of the main spectral peak .",
    "more localized modes are formed in and around this peak , and the correlation between eigenvalue and degree expectation value generally becomes stronger .",
    "second ,  increased clustering creates an additional group of delocalized low - eigenvalue modes which are associated with an increased modularity ( community structure ) of the network .",
    "as expected ,  input normalization greatly reduces the influence of degree heterogeneity  compared to the unnormalized network ,  and this is reflected in a greater uniformity of the spectra .",
    "normalization , however , does not significantly alter the effect of clustering on communities and the low modes associated with them .",
    "in general ,  study of the laplacian spectra and the properties of the eigenvectors reveals complex structures whose significance should be explored further in future work .",
    "many qualitative features are independent of the average degree @xmath92 but depend only on the type of topology and coupling scheme .  some peculiar details of the spectral shapes we have observed remain to be fully explained  ( see , for example , figs .",
    "[ iprcomb ] and [ devncomb ] . )     we found that when coordinates based on the laplacian eigenbasis are used to examine the dynamics of a network of coupled phase oscillators ,  the transition to synchronization can be visualized in ways that are not apparent from global order parameters alone .  roughly speaking , extremal eigenvalues give information about the onset of synchronization or desynchronization , whereas the full spectrum is relevant to the full process of synchronization",
    ".  in particular , in many cases , modes or groups of modes make quasi - independent transitions to synchronization as the coupling strength is increased , with low modes synchronizing at higher coupling strengths .",
    "the process of synchronization can be viewed as a contraction of the dynamics onto progressively lower - dimensional submanifolds of the phase space as different eigenmodes lock one by one .",
    "the presence of low - lying modes , which are hard to lock , can significantly retard the achievement of full synchronization .",
    "the quasi - independence of eigenvectors is a somewhat surprising result in a highly nonlinear regime of partial synchronization .",
    "previously the laplacian was applied only to the linear stability of a perfectly synchronized state .",
    "unlike the situation with the linear ( msf ) problem ,  in the regime of partial synchronization a knowledge of the eigenvalue spectrum alone is not sufficient to predict the full dynamics .",
    "the dependence of transition point on eigenvalue is different for each type of network even though the broad trend ( the transition point is a decreasing function of eigenvalue ) is the same for all .",
    "but the spectrum is nonetheless a source of at least heuristic insight into the dynamics , and particular groups of eigenvectors can be directly associated with aspects of the dynamics :  for example , high modes with the advanced transition in high - clustering sfn s ,  or low modes with frequency clustering and the inhibition of full synchronization .    in the future , diagnostic techniques based on the laplacian spectrum can be applied to other types of networks .",
    "it may be worthwhile to examine spectral effects of assortative mixing , and to test our conjecture that assortative mixing should bring the laplacian and adjacency matrix spectra into closer congruence .",
    "it may also be interesting to attempt a finite size scaling analyis of the separate transitions undergone by different normal modes .",
    "just as one gains important information by considering the full process of synchronization and not only the onset@xcite ,  one also gains information by examining the full spectrum of eigenvectors .",
