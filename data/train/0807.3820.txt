    "study of eclipsing binaries is still the most effective way of determining the absolute parameters of stars , especially from the spectroscopic and photometric analysis of detached double - lined eclipsing binaries , masses and radii of the components can be obtained with a precision of @xmath151 per cent ( e.g. southworth et al .",
    "2005 ; baki et al .",
    "2008 ) , the limit precision for stellar evolutionary tests ( andersen 1991 ) . among the stars , those in the upper main sequence band are particularly useful in empirical tests of the convection formulae used in various evolution codes , while systems containing unevolved stars are useful in testing opacity and metallicity effects in near - zams ( zero age main sequence ) models .",
    "v731  cep , the binary discussed in the present paper , is of the latter type .",
    "the variability of v731  cep ( gsc  4288  0168 ; brightness at maximum v@xmath1510.5 mag ; orbital period @xmath16@xmath156.06 d ) was discovered by baki et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ( hereafter b03 ) . a brief history of v731  cep was given by baki et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ( hereafter b07 ) who presented photometric light curves in _ bvr@xmath0 _ and _ i@xmath0 _ bands and limited spectroscopic observations . within the scope of a project to study close eclipsing binaries of sb2 type",
    ", we were able to obtain new times of minima as well as new spectroscopic data for v731  cep .",
    "the system has an eccentric orbit ( @xmath17 ) , which makes it an important astrophysical tool for the investigation of internal structures of its components , if the rotation period of the apsides is precisely determined .",
    "the apsidal motion period together with system geometry allow the computation of the observed internal structure constant ( isc ) to be compared with theoretical internal structure computations .",
    "the primary motivation for the present paper is to obtain the parameters of the close binary system v731  cep , to discuss the evolutionary status of the system using the system parameters with the latest evolutionary models , and to investigate the apsidal motion of the orbit for estimation of the internal structures of the component stars .",
    "as the photometric data presented by b07 are precise enough ( rms scatter of @xmath150.008 mag ) for light curve analysis with nearly complete phase coverage of the data , apart from new times of minima observations , no new photometric observations were performed in this study .",
    "the details of the photometric observations and their reduction are given in detail by b07 .",
    "the standard _",
    "ubvr@xmath0 _ and _ i@xmath0 _ magnitudes of the comparison and check stars in the same ccd field with v731  cep were derived using transformation coefficients obtained by b07 , and are given in table  1 together with near - infrared magnitudes from the two micron sky survey ( _ 2mass _ , cutri et al .",
    "_ 2mass _ magnitudes in table  1 correspond to phases where the light was at maximum",
    ".       the de - reddened visual apparent magnitude and optical absolute magnitude presented in table  8 allowed us to derive a distance of 809(30 ) pc to the system . to compare the distance of v731  cep system using a different method , a luminosity - colour relation ( bilir et al .",
    "2008 ) which has been formed for detached binary systems with main - sequence components was used in this study .",
    "the near - infrared magnitudes of the system were taken from the _",
    "2mass _ point sources catalogue of cutri et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and are shown in table  1 . for de - reddenig near - infrared magnitude and colours of the system , the following formulae ( bilir , gver , aslan 2006 ;",
    "ak et al . 2007 ; bilir et al .",
    "2008 ) were used :      all the colours and magnitude with subscript `` 0 '' show the de - reddened ones .",
    "the colour excess @xmath19 was estimated in a direction to v731  cep by using",
    "_ q_-method ( see  5.1 ) .",
    "the near - infrared absolute magnitude of v731  cep system was estimated by the luminosity - colour relation , @xmath20 , of bilir et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and the distance of the system calculated as @xmath21 pc by using the photometric parallaxes method .",
    "the photometric distance of @xmath22 pc given in table  8 is consistent with the @xmath21 pc distance estimated by luminosity - colour relation obtained for detached binary systems .",
    "binary systems with apsidal motion allow us to determine the isc , which is an important parameter of stellar evolution models . the observed apsidal motion period of @xmath23 = 10000(2500 ) yr , corresponding to a total rate of @xmath24 = 0.00060(0.00015 ) @xmath25 cycle@xmath26 was obtained in  6 .",
    "the relativistic contribution to the apsidal motion in case of v731  cep is substantial @xmath27 = 0.00045 @xmath25 cycle@xmath26 , or about 75 per cent of the total observed rate ( gimnez 1985 ) . after correcting for this effect ,",
    "an average isc was derived to be log @xmath9 = @xmath102.36 under the assumption that the component stars rotate pseudosynchronously .",
    "this value is in very good agreement with the theoretical prediction of log @xmath11 = @xmath102.34 according to new evolutionary models of claret ( 2004 ) with the standard chemical composition of ( x , z ) = ( 0.70 , 0.02 ) .",
    "it should , however , be noted that the present apsidal motion solution is still tentative due to relatively short observational history of v731 cep compared to the apsidal motion period .",
    "therefore , accurate eclipse timings are strongly needed in a decade or more in order to say more definite on the apsidal motion parameters and the related isc .",
    "we investigated the evolutionary status of the system by means of the bayesian method and constructing an h - r diagram for the component masses in log t@xmath28-log l plane .",
    "we used a slightly modified version of the bayesian estimation method idealized by jrgensen & lindegren ( 2005 ) , which is designed to avoid statistical biases and to take error estimates of all observed quantities into consideration .",
    "estimation of age and metal abundance of the components was made by using the web interfacelgirardi / cgi - bin / param ] based on the bayesian method of da silva et al .",
    "including their errors , the effective temperatures , visual brightness , metal abundance of components and distance to the system were the parameters used in the web interface to obtain the best matching model parameters ( i.e. surface gravity ( log @xmath29 ) , radii ( @xmath30 ) , masses ( @xmath31 ) and age of components ( @xmath32 ) ) to padova isochrones by the bayesian method .",
    "since the metal abundance of the components was initially not known , a range of metal abundance ( i.e. @xmath100.10 @xmath33 @xmath13 $ ] @xmath33 + 0.10 dex ) was selected and the values in this range were used with 0.02 dex steps .",
    "the output model parameters for each component were compared by means of @xmath34 test with the absolute dimensions of the components listed in table  8 .",
    "consequently , the minimum @xmath34 yielded simultaneously the metal abundance and age of the components as @xmath13_1=-0.06(0.02)$ ] dex and @xmath35 myr for the primary and @xmath13_2=-0.02(0.02)$ ] dex and @xmath36 myr for the secondary component . from these values , we adopted the mean metal abundance and mean age of the system to be @xmath13=-0.04(0.02)$ ] dex and @xmath37 myr , respectively .",
    "interpretation of the evolutionary status of v731  cep requires also the construction of h - r diagrams using the latest theoretical evolutionary models . in fig .",
    "8 , the components of v731  cep are shown in the log t@xmath28-log @xmath38 plane together with yonsei - yale ( y2 ) evolutionary tracks ( yi , demarque , kim et al .",
    "2001 ; hereafter ydk ) for different masses .",
    "evolutionary tracks for the exact masses of the components were also computed using the code provided by ydk . among the tracks computed for the exact masses with their errors , those with @xmath13$]@xmath8 - 0.024 dex ( @xmath39@xmath80.0172 )",
    "metallicity models match the locations of the components within the error limits in the log t@xmath28-log @xmath38 plane .",
    "we also computed a set of isochrones using a metallicity of @xmath13$]@xmath8 @xmath100.024 dex in y2 models . in fig .",
    "8 , two isochrones ( @xmath12100 myr and @xmath12120 myr ) are plotted for comparison .",
    "it was found that 120 myr age is the best fitting isochrone to the locations of both components .",
    "although , the most reliable method of metal abundance determination is the atmosphere modeling of spectral lines , in the present study , it seems fair to conclude that the two methods ( bayesian methods and evolutionary tracks ) used for estimation of the metallicity and age of the system are in excellent agreement within the error limits .",
    "the metallicity we found for the components should be confirmed with the atmosphere modeling of metallic absorption lines in spectra taken in wider wavelength range .",
    "one of the formation regions of early - type stars is open clusters . to find a possible formation region for v731  cep",
    ", nearby young open clusters were investigated . among others ,",
    "ngc  7762 was found to be the closest open cluster and the most similar in chemical composition to v731  cep .",
    "chincarini ( 1966 ) estimated the distance of ngc  7762 to be 750 pc and the age 266 myr . in a more recent study relating on the cluster ,",
    "patat & carraro ( 1995 ) proposed a similar distance of 800 pc to ngc  7762 .",
    "nevertheless , patat & carraro ( 1995 ) estimated an older age for the cluster at 1.8 gyr and less metallicity compared to the sun .",
    "the age ( 133 myr ) we adopted for v731  cep system seems to agree more with the age ( 266 myr ) that chincarini ( 1966 ) calculated for ngc  7762 .",
    "in addition to this , the distance and metal abundance estimation of ngc  7762 by patat & carraro ( 1995 ) are in agreement with the distance and metal abundance of v731  cep found in this study . the most reliable evidence that v731  cep is evaporated from ngc  7762",
    "can be obtained from the spatial distribution and the metallicity of v731  cep .    in calculation of the kinematical properties of v731",
    "cep , the systemic velocity , distance and proper motion components listed in table  8 were used in the algorithm given by johnson & soderbloom ( 1987 ) .",
    "the computed space velocity components with their errors are given in table  8 .",
    "the total space velocity of 14 km s@xmath26 for v731  cep is in agreement with the space velocities of young stars .",
    "although the space velocity of the cluster could not be computed due to its unavailable rv data , the distance of 55 pc between v731  cep and ngc  7762 , and similar age and metallicity distribution of v731  cep with ngc  7762 , suggest that v731  cep could be evaporated from ngc  7762 . however , it is necessary to carry out precise photometric and spectroscopic observations of the member stars of ngc  7762 in order to form more definite conclusions on the history of v731  cep in relation with ngc  7762 .",
