    "the parity nonconservation ( pnc ) amplitude of the @xmath10-@xmath11 transition in cesium is presently the most precise low - energy test of the electroweak theory .",
    "this precision is a result of highly accurate measurements  @xcite and the almost equally accurate atomic calculations used for their interpretation  @xcite .",
    "this interpretation shows that the value of the weak nuclear charge for @xmath12cs , coming from the pnc measurements , differs from the prediction of the standard model by 1.6@xmath13  @xcite .",
    "although this can not be regarded as disagreement , it indicates that further improvements to the accuracy of the measurements and interpretation may lead to new important results .    additionally , the need for new measurements is motivated by the requirement to check the existing results .",
    "it is very important that an independent test of the existing experimental results  @xcite is performed .",
    "these are very important results and must be checked even if the accuracy is not improved .",
    "moreover , there is a good chance for both theoretical and experimental improvement since the pnc amplitudes of these systems are up to 50 times larger than in cs .",
    "it is natural to expect a higher accuracy in measurements of systems where the pnc effect is larger . on the other hand , for high accuracy of the calculations it is important to have systems with a simple electron structure .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath14 transitions in the fr - like ions considered in this paper seem to be very promising in this regard . the pnc amplitude is larger for atoms or ions with higher nuclear charge @xmath15",
    "it is also larger for the @xmath0-@xmath14 transitions  @xcite than for the @xmath0-@xmath0 transitions like the one used in cesium  @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of these calculations is also expected to be high since the ions have simple electron structure with one valence electron above closed shells similar to that of cesium .",
    "there are several additional factors which promise potentially better theoretical accuracy for these ions than for cs :    * the main source of theoretical uncertainty is electron correlations . the relative value of the correlation correction is smaller for ions than for neutral atoms .",
    "* there are no strong cancellations between different correlation corrections for @xmath0-@xmath14 pnc amplitudes  @xcite in contrast to very strong cancellation for the @xmath10-@xmath11 pnc amplitude in cs . *",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath14 pnc amplitude is strongly dominated by the term with the @xmath14-@xmath16 electric dipole transition amplitude and @xmath0-@xmath16 weak matrix element . this term can be checked and/or corrected if an accurate experimental value for the @xmath14-@xmath16 amplitude is known .",
    "a similar approach in cs works with limited accuracy due to strong cancellation between @xmath10-@xmath17 and @xmath11-@xmath17 contributions .",
    "pnc measurements have been considered for the ba@xmath2 ion  @xcite and are in progress for the ra@xmath2 ion  @xcite .",
    "the frpnc collaboration has begun the construction of a laser cooling and trapping apparatus with the purpose of measuring atomic parity nonconservation in microwave and optical transitions of francium  @xcite . with a pnc amplitude in the @xmath11-@xmath18 optical transition expected to be around 15 times larger than that of cesium , and its relatively simple electronic configuration ,",
    "francium is a very good candidate atom for precision measurements and calculations of pnc  @xcite .    with the aim of motivating experiment in this important area , we present calculations of @xmath0-@xmath0 and @xmath0-@xmath14 pnc amplitudes for several cs- and fr - like ions .",
    "simple estimates show that the size of the pnc effect should scale as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a relativistic factor , @xmath15 is nuclear charge and @xmath21 is the effective charge defined as @xmath22 atomic units  @xcite . here , @xmath23 is the energy of valence electron , @xmath24 the principal quantum number ( @xmath25 for fr - like ions )",
    ". therefore pnc effects in these ions are only slightly smaller than in neutral atoms",
    ".    of particular interest are the optical @xmath0-@xmath14 pnc transitions of @xmath9th@xmath4 and @xmath26la@xmath3 , and the ir transition in @xmath27ac@xmath3 .",
    "@xmath9th has a half - life of @xmath28 years and @xmath27ac of @xmath29 years , much more stable than fr with its most stable isotope ( @xmath30fr ) having a half - life of just 22 minutes .",
    "@xmath26la@xmath3 is stable .",
    "importantly , the @xmath9th@xmath4 ion has been trapped and cooled by campbell _",
    "et al . _",
    "this was the first reported laser cooling of a multiply charged ion .",
    "the experiment needed to measure the @xmath11-@xmath31 pnc amplitude in th@xmath4 is somewhat different to the conventional pnc experiments .",
    "neither of the states of interest are the ground state and the pnc amplitude must be reached by first populating the metastable @xmath11 state .",
    "this is explored in more detail in the later sections .",
    "ac@xmath3 maintains a @xmath11 ground state , and has a very long lived @xmath31 state , which is highly beneficial for pnc measurements  @xcite .",
    "@xmath27ac and the odd - nucleon isotope @xmath32th ( with a half - life of @xmath33 years ) will also be of interest for measurements of nuclear - spin - dependent pnc in optical or hyperfine transitions , including the extraction of the nuclear anapole moment and the strength of the pnc nuclear forces ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , < , > , > , < , > , > , < , > , > \" , ]     [ tab : prob ]",
    "we have provided calculations of parity nonconservation , energy levels , matrix elements and lifetimes of several cs - like rare - earth and fr - like actinide ions .",
    "we demonstrate that these systems provide a very high theoretical accuracy . with the inclusion of other effects ( such as breit , qed , ladder operators etc . )",
    "this could lead to better precision in the calculations than has been achieved in cesium .    with very large pnc amplitudes",
    ", these ions can be expected also to have a very high accuracy in the measurements , with the added benefits of ( near)-stable nuclei in ba@xmath8 , la@xmath3 , ac@xmath3 and th@xmath3 , and long - lived upper and lower states for ba@xmath8 , la@xmath3 , ra@xmath8 and particularly ac@xmath3 .",
