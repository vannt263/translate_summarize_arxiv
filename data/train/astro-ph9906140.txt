    "the understanding of the stellar populations of early - type galaxies plays a key role in assessing the origin of these systems .",
    "elliptical galaxies yield robust color - magnitude relations , as shown with high photometric precision by bower , lucey & ellis ( 1992 ) for the virgo and coma clusters .",
    "the origin of this color - magnitude relation is under a strong debate ; the relation could either be caused by a variation of the mean stellar metallicity along the relation ( e.g. , arimoto & yoshii 1987 ; kodama & arimoto 1997 ) , or it can be attributed to a variation of the age and metallicity ( ferreras , charlot & silk 1998 ) .",
    "this is because the interpretation of the stellar populations from the integrated light of galaxies suffers from the fact that there is an age - metallicity degeneracy , i.e , the two effects can not be separated simultaneously with current techniques ( oconnell 1986 ; worthey 1994 ; arimoto 1996 ) .",
    "one expects that , rather than using colors , more accurate spectral information should be able to break this degeneracy .",
    "in particular , balmer lines were thought to be ideal candidates , because younger ( i.e. hotter ) stars show stronger hydrogen absorption ( oconnell 1976 ) .",
    "however , worthey ( 1994 ) showed that use of h@xmath5 at intermediate spectral resolution ( @xmath6  kms@xmath4 ) together with a large set of the other lick metallic absorption lines is not enough to provide the desired age - metallicity discrimination . therefore more accurate and reliable estimates for the ages of early - type galaxies",
    "are crucial in understanding their formation .",
    "worthey & ottaviani ( 1997 ) showed the importance of increasing resolution when working with balmer lines , and jones & worthey ( 1995 ) ( hereafter jw95 ) have shown the ability of their h@xmath7 ( a redefinition of rose 1994 h@xmath0 index ) high resolution index to separate the metallicity and age effects .",
    "in this paper we study h@xmath0 feature to understand its power in breaking the well known degeneracy . in ",
    "2 we use the high spectral resolution ( fwhm@xmath81.8 ) single - age , single - metallicity stellar populations ( ssp s ) model library of vazdekis ( 1999 ) ( hereafter v99 ) and find that h@xmath7 is strongly dependent on resolution and galaxy velocity dispersion . in ",
    "3 we study h@xmath0 as a function of age , metallicity and resolution and define a new indicator which is completely insensitive to metallicity and stable against resolution .",
    "we deal with the most important problems affecting this indicator and propose a recipe for determining the average stellar age of a galaxy . in   4 we present a discussion and in",
    "  5 our conclusions .",
    "to study h@xmath0 feature we use the spectral synthesis model of v99 ( an extended version of the evolutionary stellar population synthesis model of vazdekis et al .",
    "1996 ) which predicts spectral energy distributions ( sed s ) for single - aged old stellar populations with metallicities @xmath9\\leq+0.2 $ ] at resolution fwhm@xmath1  in the optical region .",
    "the model uses as input database the empirical spectral library of jones ( 1997 ) , after a careful selection of a subsample of @xmath8550 stars . one important advantage of this model is that it allows direct measurements of particular absorption features on the spectra of ssp s with specified metallicity , age , and initial stellar mass function ( imf ) , instead of employing polynomial fitting functions that relate the absorption line - strengths with the stellar atmospheric parameters ( worthey 1994 ; vazdekis et al . 1996 ) .",
    "we use the _ bimodal imf _ of vazdekis et al .",
    "( 1996 ) with a shallow low - mass ( @xmath10 ) slope and a salpeter ( 1955 ) high mass slope .      in v99",
    "we showed the intermediate resolution indices h@xmath11 and h@xmath12 ( worthey & ottaviani 1997 ) and the high resolution index h@xmath7 ( jw95 ) as a function of the age and metallicity for ssp s .",
    "unexpectedly , the two set of indices show opposite trends : at specified age , most metal - deficient ssp s give largest values for h@xmath11 and h@xmath12 but h@xmath7 .",
    "moreover , the wavelength baselines covered by h@xmath11 and h@xmath12 are considerably larger than the one by h@xmath7 .",
    "this fact suggests that h@xmath0 is not only sensitive to resolution but also to the way in which the index is defined , as was pointed out by jw95 .",
    "we therefore speculate that there must be a particular definition ( with wavelength coverage larger than in h@xmath7 but shorter than in h@xmath12 and h@xmath11 , where the index is insensitive to metallicity .",
    "1 shows h@xmath7 as a function of the metallicity and age of the ssp for different resolutions @xmath2 s . for @xmath13",
    "kms@xmath4 the most metal - rich ssp s provide the largest values .",
    "this tendency is much less pronounced for @xmath14  kms@xmath4 , where the previous trend is starting to change ( e.g. , the values for [ fe / h]=@xmath150.4 are larger than those for [ fe / h]=0.0 ) . for @xmath16",
    "kms@xmath4 we get the maximum convergence of the lines ; this resolution seems to be the _ inflection point _ at which all loci with different metallicities converge . finally , for @xmath17  kms@xmath4 the trend is completely inverted ( resembling h@xmath11 and h@xmath12 ) .",
    "2 shows various ssp model spectra of 13  gyr and different metallicities broadened to the resolutions used in fig .  1 .",
    "in first panel we mark the definition of h@xmath7 , which measures the ew of a total area of 3.74    centered on h@xmath0 by selecting as pseudocontinua the left and right peaks ( indicated by arrows ) .",
    "while h@xmath0 has nearly the same depth , the metallic contribution from its left side is strengthening the feature for more metal - rich populations . for stars ,",
    "the dependence of h@xmath11 , h@xmath12 , and h@xmath7 as a function of t@xmath18 was shown by worthey & ottaviani ( 1997 ) and jones ( 1997 ) respectively : in all cases the ew increases very sharply for t@xmath18 s larger than @xmath85500  k , but for lower t@xmath18 s where h@xmath0 is basically constant .",
    "since old stellar populations have t@xmath18 s in this lower temperature range , differences in t@xmath18 due to changes in metallicity are not enough to vary the absorption strength rapidly enough to compensate the very slow change of h@xmath0 .",
    "we conclude that for old stellar populations the strengthening of h@xmath7 as a function of metallicity is mainly caused by its adjacent blue side metallic absorption .",
    "when broadening the spectra to @xmath14  kms@xmath4 these metallic features are merged with h@xmath0 line .",
    "however the adopted pseudocontinua start to be depressed by the deepening of the strong neighboring fei lines centered on 4325    and 4352    ( the latter also contains mgi ) , affecting h@xmath7 strength in the reverse sense . for @xmath16",
    "kms@xmath4 these pseudocontinua are more depressed ( than for @xmath14  kms@xmath4 ) for more metal - rich ssp s , making h@xmath7 nearly identical .",
    "this is what we have called the inflection point , where metallicity effects are negligible .",
    "finally , for @xmath17  kms@xmath4 the pseudocontinua are considerably depressed , breaking the effect that occurs at @xmath19  kms@xmath4 , and causing larger ew s for most metal - deficient ssp s",
    ". unfortunately , due to limitations in model parameter coverage , we are unable to study in detail the inflection point for ssp s of younger ages and/or lower metallicities .",
    "1 shows that h@xmath7 provides a stronger power at separating age at @xmath16  kms@xmath4 than for lower or higher resolutions .",
    "jw95 calculated h@xmath7 for ssp s using a different approach : they derived empirical fitting functions which relate the stellar atmospheric parameters to the measured line - strengths on the basis of jones ( 1997 ) stellar library ( after broadening the spectra to @xmath20  kms@xmath4 ) .",
    "their h@xmath7 model predictions fall among the first two plots of fig .  1 ( i.e. those calculated for @xmath21 and @xmath22  kms@xmath4 ) . fig .",
    "1 also shows that h@xmath7 is very sensitive to resolution due to the selection of these two peaks as pseudocontinua ( which also vary in height and position as a function of metallicity ) .",
    "thus , h@xmath7 age disentangling power is destroyed with very small @xmath2 changes .    to achieve a metallicity insensitive h@xmath0 indicator which is stable against @xmath2 we used the following approach : first we broadened the ssp spectral library of v99 by steps of @xmath23  kms@xmath4 from @xmath13  kms@xmath4 to @xmath24  kms@xmath4 .",
    "we propose various h@xmath0 index definitions , and then we measure them on these model spectra .",
    "we find new indices , [ h@xmath0 + 1/2(fei+mgi)]@xmath25 , which are completely insensitive to metallicity , at well separated resolutions : @xmath26  kms@xmath4 , @xmath19  kms@xmath4 and @xmath27  kms@xmath4 , each quite stable in a range of @xmath28  kms@xmath4 .",
    "table  1 provides the new definitions ( also marked in fig .  2 ) .",
    "[ h@xmath0 + 1/2(fei+mgi)]@xmath29 uses the effect of the blue pseudocontinuum to precisely guarantee this ability to disentangle the age , while for the red pseudocontinuum it uses a portion of the very stable continuum around 4364 . to achieve the resolution stability ( required for practical applications ) we select the blue pseudocontinuum to fall into the bottom of h@xmath0 ( @xmath30=4340.468 ) , and the feature to fall well inside this pseudocontinuum",
    "this selection introduces a change that is cancelled by extending the red edge of our feature to the bottom of fei+mgi at @xmath30=4352.737  ( fei ) : for increasing metallicities the strength lost due to blue pseudocontinuum depression ( caused by the strengthening of fei at 4325  and by the full inclusion in this pseudocontinuum of h@xmath0 blue side metallic absorption ) is cancelled with the depth gained by fei+mgi strengthening ( which is contributing to the feature in the new definition ) .",
    "thus this index is not just an ew as we are dealing with the _ absorption line profile _ , and then it is required spectroscopy of very high signal - to - noise ratio and relatively high dispersion ( see   3.2 ) . at this level of accuracy ,",
    "an influence of the stellar kinematics can not be neglected . in particular , kinematically complex systems ( e.g. , prada et al .",
    "1996 ) would require a simultaneous line profiles and kinematics processing .",
    "modifying these definitions slightly , we find similar age - metallicity trends for @xmath16  kms@xmath4 and @xmath17  kms@xmath4 , providing equally stable @xmath2 ranges .",
    "these indices allow us to cover almost the whole range of galaxy @xmath2 s up to @xmath31  kms@xmath4 .",
    "however , despite the fact that such inflection point can essentially be found for larger @xmath2 s ( @xmath32  kms@xmath4 ) , resulting solutions were not stable against resolution .",
    "3 demonstrates the robustness and age disentangling power of [ h@xmath0 + 1/2(fei+mgi)]@xmath25 system .",
    "bottom - left panel of fig .  3 shows [ h@xmath0 + 1/2(fei+mgi)]@xmath29 stability against resolution . table  2 tabulates the mean index values for various ages of the ssp s",
    ". we also note that [ h@xmath0 + 1/2(fei+mgi)]@xmath25 indices are probably not unique for achieving this age discriminating power and alternative definitions could well be sought .      in this section",
    "we study the problems that can affect [ h@xmath0 + 1/2(fei+mgi)]@xmath25 indicators for practical applications .",
    "table  3 summarizes their characteristics and major uncertainties .      the spectral resolution effect is extensively discussed in   3.1 .",
    "table  3 tabulates @xmath2 ranges where [ h@xmath0 + 1/2(fei+mgi)]@xmath25 indices are stable against resolution . within these ranges",
    "( @xmath33  kms@xmath4 ) it is possible to distinguish models of 13  gyr and 17  gyr , irrespective of the metallicity ( in the range @xmath150.7@xmath34[fe / h]@xmath34 + 0.2 ) .",
    "bottom - left panel of fig .",
    "3 shows that [ h@xmath0 + 1/2(fei+mgi)]@xmath25 indices are also stable within @xmath28  kms@xmath4 but the age disentangling power decreases slightly ( only ssp s younger than 12  gyr can be distinguished from one of 17  gyr ) .",
    "unfortunately , the required signal - to - noise ratio per  , s / n( ) , is very high , limiting the number of galaxies observable with most of present - day intermediate class telescopes .",
    "an estimate of the required exposure time can be done using the analytical approach of cardiel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ( eqs . ( 9 ) and ( 41 ) to ( 44 ) ) .",
    "following their notation , coefficients c1 and c2 are calculated from eqs .",
    "( 43 ) and ( 44 ) using table  1 index definitions . assuming a desirable index error ( @xmath35 $ ] ) , we use eq .",
    "( 41 ) to estimate the required s / n( ) ( sn ) .",
    "then by approaching @xmath36 , we use eq . ( 42 ) to obtain the number of counts per adu : @xmath37 , \\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the dispersion in   per resolution element , @xmath39 is the gain in @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the readout noise in @xmath42 .",
    "finally we compare with the signal obtained in real observational runs .",
    "an example in which we integrate all photons within @xmath43 for a nearby galaxy center with @xmath44 on a 4 m class telescope is given in table  3 .",
    "we used @xmath450.8   / pix and @xmath46 .",
    "table  3 also shows that higher resolution [ h@xmath0 + 1/2(fei+mgi)]@xmath25 definitions require lower s / n s .",
    "table  3 shows largest @xmath30 errors or shifts allowed to guarantee [ h@xmath0 + 1/2(fei+mgi)]@xmath25 age disentangling power .",
    "thus irrespective of galaxy @xmath2 s , observational spectra of relatively high dispersion ( @xmath470.8 ) are required to achieve an accurate @xmath30 calibration that is typically @xmath8 5 - 10% of the adopted dispersion .",
    "this also implies that radial velocity effects such as galaxy internal rotational velocity or redshift should be taken into account with high precision . for this purpose the observed spectrum should be crosscorrelated with an appropriate v99 model spectrum ( see appendix ) .",
    "we also note that a galaxy with a recession velocity of @xmath48  kms@xmath4 produces a difference of @xmath49  between the bluest point of the blue pseudocontinuum and the reddest point of the red pseudocontinuum , i.e. , as large as the largest @xmath30 shift allowed for [ h@xmath0 + 1/2(fei+mgi)]@xmath29 .",
    "therefore the ( 1+@xmath50 ) effect should be properly accounted for .",
    "the effect of the spectrum shape on [ h@xmath0 + 1/2(fei+mgi)]@xmath25 should be small because the wavelength range involved is quite narrow .",
    "we have done the following test : we removed the continuum of v99 model spectra ( using an spline3 of order 6 ) and then measured [ h@xmath0 + 1/2(fei+mgi)]@xmath25 .",
    "table  3 shows the largest differences ( obtained for the oldest ssp s ) when comparing to previous measurements ( i.e. , on the ssp spectra with a flux calibrated response ) .",
    "we conclude that the effect of the instrumental response curve on [ h@xmath0 + 1/2(fei+mgi)]@xmath25 is nearly negligible .",
    "table  3 summarizes the largest theoretical age uncertainties as well as the ones obtained when adopting the largest errors allowed either in @xmath2 , @xmath51 ( e.g. , errors in @xmath30 calibration , redshift , rotation curve ) or s / n slightly lower than recommended .      a detailed description of the main characteristics and uncertainties of [ h@xmath0 + 1/2(fei+mgi)]@xmath25 indices was performed in   3.2 .",
    "here we summarize the steps required to ensure a correct index measurement :    1 .",
    "the observed spectrum should satisfy the high s / n requirement of table  3 , which can be achieved by integrating over the spatial direction .",
    "dispersion should be large enough ( preferably @xmath520.8 / pix ) to prevent absolute @xmath51 shifts or errors with a precision as given in table  3 .",
    "2 .   determine @xmath2 along the spatial direction ( e.g. , by using stellar template spectra acquired with the same instrumental configuration , or by using v99 models ) . very accurate @xmath2 measurement is not essential .",
    "3 .   crosscorrelate the observed spectrum with an appropriate v99 model spectrum ( instead of using a stellar template ) to determine its absolute radial velocity , which has to be taken into account when measuring the index ( see appendix ) .",
    "this is a very important step .",
    "4 .   integrate over spatial direction to achieve the required s /",
    "n . variations of velocity rotation ( and @xmath2 ) must be smaller than indicated in table  3 .",
    "otherwise they should be carefully taken into account .",
    "5 .   measure [ h@xmath0 + 1/2(fei+mgi)]@xmath25 index appropriate for obtained @xmath2 and compare with table  2 to estimate the age falls outside [ h@xmath0 + 1/2(fei+mgi)]@xmath25 resolution stability range ( see table  3 ) , results improve slightly if the observational spectrum is broadened ( by convolving with a gaussian ) to match @xmath2 of the index .",
    "however the reader should be aware that higher resolution definitions require lower s / n s ( see table  3 ) . ] .",

    "first panel of fig .  3 shows [ h@xmath0 + 1/2(fei+mgi)]@xmath29 measurements for two metal - rich globular clusters of our galaxy , 47  tuc and ngc  6624 ( rose 1994 ) , five low velocity dispersion ellipticals of jones ( 1997 ) ( ngc  4489 , ngc  4239 , ngc  3605 , ngc  4387 and m  32 ) and the standard s0 galaxy ngc  7332 ( vazdekis 1996 ) . the latter spectrum , with 1  @xmath53 exposure time , was obtained at observatorio del roque de los muchachos , la palma , using the 4.2 m wht ( isis spectrograph ) .",

    "all these spectra ( except ngc  7332 which has @xmath55  kms@xmath4 ) were pre - broadened to a common resolution of @xmath22  kms@xmath4 .",
    "the m  32 spectrum ( with extremely high s / n , see jw95 ) was broadened to @xmath56 and @xmath57 for measuring [ h@xmath0 + 1/2(fei+mgi)]@xmath58 and [ h@xmath0 + 1/2(fei+mgi)]@xmath59 respectively ( see right panels of fig .",
    "obtained ages ( using table  2 ) are in good internal consistency since the three indices provide @xmath84  gyr .",
    "jw95 obtained @xmath87  gyr on the basis of h@xmath7 .",
    "this difference could be attributed in part to the fact that the stellar isochrones adopted in worthey s ( 1994 ) population synthesis model are systematically hotter than those used in vazdekis et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and to possible effects caused by the fact that h@xmath7 is strongly sensitive to very small @xmath2 variations .",
    "however our age estimation is in full agreement with an extraordinary fit that we have obtained for this galaxy using v99 models ( see fig .  4 and appendix ) .",
    "the two clusters are found to be very old ( @xmath6013  gyr ) .",
    "this sample of low - luminosity ellipticals show a rather large spread in age ; ngc  4489 ( @xmath61  gyr ) , m  32 ( @xmath62  gyr ) , ngc  4239 ( @xmath63  gyr ) , ngc  3605 ( @xmath64  gyr ) and ngc  4387 ( @xmath65  gyr ) , respectively .",
    "finally , for ngc  7332 we obtain @xmath86  gyr ( in full agreement with vazdekis 1996 ) .",
    "since our results are based on ssp model predictions this method estimates luminosity - weighted average stellar ages , but can not tell whether this spread is due to a real difference of _ mean stellar age _ , implying different epoch of galaxy formation , or caused by a contamination of intermediate age stars formed in a secondary episode of star formation ( kodama & arimoto 1998 ) .",
    "[ h@xmath0 + 1/2(fei+mgi)]@xmath25 indices cover most of galaxy @xmath2 s range ( up to @xmath66  km@xmath4 ) . in this paper",
    "we derive average ages for globular clusters and low - luminosity ellipticals",
    ". however we stress that these indices are fully applicable to normal and giant ellipticals , including cd s .",
    "once high s / n spectra of relatively high dispersion are obtained , accurate and reliable estimates for the average stellar ages of these galaxies will be possible , without assessing their metallicities .",
    "once the age is determined , metallicity can be evaluated uniquely from key metallic lines .",
    "the age - metallicity degeneracy of line indices is solved .",
    "we note that [ h@xmath0 + 1/2(fei+mgi)]@xmath25 indices are probably not unique as age indicators for old stellar populations . other balmer lines with neighboring metallic lines",
    "could also produce a similar effect and need to be addressed .",
    "direct estimates of galaxy age would provide a definitive answer to the origin of the cmr which is tightly followed by cluster elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , bower , lucey & ellis 1992 ) . field ellipticals and small groups of galaxies might have formed differently from those in rich clusters .",
    "gonzlez ( 1993 ) showed that field ellipticals have significantly stronger h@xmath67 indices than expected from worthey s ( 1994 ) models of very old age .",
    "this implies that they could be younger than cluster ellipticals .",
    "however h@xmath67 is not an accurate age indicator since its dependence on metallicity is not negligible , and since it could be easily filled in with nebular emission ( davies et al . 1993 ) even for early - type galaxies .",
    "h@xmath0 is substantially less affected .",
    "it is well known that stars in the galactic halo , including those in globular clusters , are enhanced in @xmath68-elements ( e.g. , mg , si , ca ) with respect to fe ( edvardsson et al . 1993 ) .",
    "giant elliptical galaxies show @xmath69 \\simeq + 0.3 $ ] ( peletier 1989 , worthey , faber & gonzlez 1992 , vazdekis et al .",
    "this may cause a small effect on the resulting age estimate , because we have assumed solar abundance ratios throughout the present study ( although [ h@xmath0 + 1/2(fei+mgi)]@xmath25 includes both fe and mg in its definition ) .",
    "worthey ( 1998 ) suggested that abundance ratio changes can cause changes in isochrone temperature structure that can mimic an age effect .",
    "salaris & weiss ( 1998 ) have shown that scaled - solar isochrones no longer can be used to replace @xmath68-enhanced ones at the same total metallicity .",
    "unfortunately , empirical spectra of stars with different @xmath69 $ ] ratios are not yet available and we can not assess this problem for the moment .",
    "we define new spectral indices , [ h@xmath0 + 1/2(fei+mgi)]@xmath25 , which are robust age indicators for old and relatively old stellar populations and therefore have a great potential for breaking the age - metallicity degeneracy of galaxy spectra . to achieve this we use the new evolutionary stellar population synthesis model of vazdekis ( 1999 ) which provides sed s of ssp s at fwhm@xmath1 .",
    "these new models not only allow us to investigate the behavior of h@xmath0 as a function of metallicity and age , but also as a function of spectral resolution by performing a direct measurement of the feature on the synthesized ssp spectra broadened to different @xmath2 s .",
    "we show that the strong power of h@xmath0 to disentangle the age is due to a compensating effect : at specified age the strengthening of h@xmath0 is mainly caused by its adjacent metallic absorption which is more prominent for more metal - rich populations . on the other hand the adopted pseudocontinua are depressed by the effects of the strong neighboring fei lines on both sides of h@xmath0 ( centered on 4325  and 4352 ) . on the basis of this effect",
    "we achieve new h@xmath0 index definitions that are completely insensitive to the metallicity in the range -0.7@xmath34[fe / h]@xmath34 + 0.2 .",
    "however , since this effect is strongly dependent on the adopted resolution and galaxy velocity dispersion , we have optimized h@xmath0 definitions for assessing the resolution stability required for practical applications .",
    "we propose unprecedented age indicators , [ h@xmath0 + 1/2(fei+mgi)]@xmath25 , at well separated velocity dispersions : @xmath14 , @xmath19 , and @xmath27  kms@xmath4 , and each is stable in a range of @xmath28  kms@xmath4 , thus allowing study of most galaxies up to @xmath3  kms@xmath4 .",
    "the main characteristics and uncertainties affecting [ h@xmath0 + 1/2(fei+mgi)]@xmath25 are extensively discussed .",
    "since we are dealing with the absorption profile of h@xmath0 , observational spectra of very high signal - to - noise ( s / n()@xmath60200 ) and relatively high dispersion ( @xmath470.8 / pix ) , but feasible for luminous nearby galaxies with 4 m class telescopes , are required to gain this unprecedented age discriminating power .",
    "we provide a recipe for a correct measurement of [ h@xmath0 + 1/2(fei+mgi)]@xmath25 : determine @xmath2 of the observed spectrum , determine its absolute radial velocity ( by using a synthetic spectrum which match best the age / metallicity of the galaxy ) , measure the index appropriate for that velocity dispersion , and compare with the metallicity - insensitive model values of table  2 to estimate the age .",
    "high s / n s can be achieved by integrating along the spatial direction if variations of velocity rotation ( and @xmath2 ) are properly accounted for .",
    "once observational spectra of high quality are acquired , accurate and reliable estimates for the luminosity - weighted average stellar ages of these galaxies will be possible for the first time , without assessing their metallicities . in this paper",
    "we perform such measurements for two metal - rich globular clusters , a sample of low - luminosity ellipticals and a standard s0 galaxy .",
    "we find a large spread in the average stellar ages of these low - luminosity ellipticals .",
    "in particular , these indices yield 4  gyr for m  32 .",
    "this value is in excellent agreement with the age provided by an extraordinary fit to the full spectrum of this galaxy that we achieve in this paper .",
    "we are indebted to j. rose and l. jones for providing their globular cluster and elliptical galaxy spectra .",
    "we are grateful to v.vanseviius and r. peletier for very interesting comments and suggestions .",
    "we are also grateful to the referee for useful corrections and suggestions .",
    "thanks the japan society for promotion of science for financial support .",
    "this work was financially supported in part by a grant - in - aid for the scientific research ( no.09640311 ) by the japan ministry of education , culture , sports and science .",
    "accurate radial velocity determinations can be achieved if an observational galaxy spectrum is crosscorrelated with a template which resembles best the galaxy ( e.g. tonry & davis 1979 ) .",
    "this approach would benefit substantially if templates are chosen from the new ssp model spectral library of v99 , rather than using observations of a template star ( which could easily be a poor match , thus producing a crosscorrelation peak with asymmetrical wings that could bias the centroid of the fitting function , e.g. , gaussian ) .",
    "therefore we strongly suggest the use as templates of at least various synthetic spectra ( fwhm@xmath81.8 ) of different ages ( e.g. , 1.5 , 3 , 6 and 12  gyr ) and metallicities ( [ fe / h]=-0.7 , -0.4 , 0.0 , + 0.2 ) which can be retrieved from our web site ( http://www.ioa.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/@xmath8vazdekis/ ) . choosing the model spectrum which provides the largest crosscorrelation peak height ( i.e. , produced by the most appropriate template ) ,",
    "we determine accurately the absolute radial velocity and prevent any additional shifts to the models .",
    "prior to crosscorrelation all the spectra should be rebinned logarithmically ( with same dispersion ) , continuum removed ( e.g. , using a spline3 of low order ) .",
    "results improve if the spectra are adequately filtered to remove their very high and very low frecuencies , and multiplied by a cosine - bell - like function .",
    "detailed explanations can be found in v99 ( and references therein ) .    as an example , we have crosscorrelated m  32 spectrum ( jones 1997 ) with the whole ssp model spectral library of v99 . fig .",
    "4 shows that the largest crosscorrelation peak height is obtained for a model of @xmath70  gyr and [ fe / h]=0.0 .",
    "this implies that the use of this spectrum ( or a similar one ) as template would increase the accuracy of the kinematical parameter determination .",
    "this model is overplotted on m  32 spectrum providing an extraordinary fit ( see fig .",
    "4 ) which confirms the age predicted by [ h@xmath0 + 1/2(fei+mgi)]@xmath25 .",

    "<S> we derive new spectral h@xmath0 index definitions which are robust age indicators for old and relatively old stellar populations and therefore have great potential for solving the age - metallicity degeneracy of galaxy spectra . to study this feature as a function of age , metallicity and resolution , we have used a new spectral synthesis model which predicts spectral energy distributions of single - age , single - metallicity stellar populations at resolution fwhm@xmath1  ( which can be smoothed to different resolutions ) , allowing direct measurements of the equivalent widths of particular absorption features . </S>",
    "<S> we show that h@xmath0 strong age disentangling power is due to a compensating effect : at specified age , h@xmath0 strengthens with metallicity due to an adjacent metallic absorption , but on the other hand the adopted pseudocontinua are depressed by the effects of strong neighboring fei lines on both sides of h@xmath0 . despite the fact that this effect depends strongly on the adopted resolution and galaxy velocity dispersion @xmath2 , we propose a system of indicators which are completely insensitive to metallicity and stable against resolution , allowing the study of galaxies up to @xmath3  kms@xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> an extensive analysis of the characteristics of these indices indicates that observational spectra of very high signal - to - noise ratio and relatively high dispersion , are required to gain this unprecedented age discriminating power . </S>",
    "<S> once such spectra are obtained , accurate and reliable estimates for the luminosity - weighted average stellar ages of these galaxies will become possible for the first time , without assessing their metallicities . </S>",
    "<S> we measured this index for two globular clusters , a number of low - luminosity elliptical galaxies and a standard s0 galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we find a large spread in the average stellar ages of a sample of low - luminosity ellipticals . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , these indices yield 4  gyr for m  32 . </S>",
    "<S> this value is in excellent agreement with the age provided by an extraordinary fit to the full spectrum of this galaxy that we achieve in this paper . </S>"
