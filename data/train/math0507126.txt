    "branching random walks in random environment provide microscopic models for reaction - diffusion - convection phenomena in a space inhomogeneous medium . on the other hand",
    ", many progresses have been achieved in the last decade in the understanding of random walks in random environment on @xmath3 , see  @xcite for a recent review .",
    "it is natural to investigate such branching walks , and to relate the results to the non - branching case . in this paper",
    "we continue the line of research of  @xcite : each particle gives birth to at least one descendant , according to branching and jump probabilities which depend on the location , and are given by an independent identically distributed random field ( environment ) .",
    "we stress here that the branching and the transition mechanisms are _ not _ supposed to be independent , and moreover , differently from  @xcite , we do not suppose that the _ immediate _ offsprings of a particle jump independently . for an appropriate notion of recurrence and transience",
    "we prove that either the  is recurrent for almost every environment or the  is transient for almost every environment .",
    "in addition , we show that details of the distribution of the environment does not matter , but only its support . though we could not give a complete ( explicit ) classification in the spirit of @xcite , this is quite interesting in view of the difficulty of the corresponding question for random walks in random environment . for non reversible random walks",
    "( without branching ) in random environment , only few explicit results concerning recurrence / transience are known . in the paper",
    "@xcite the case of balanced environment ( i.e. , the local drift is always  @xmath4 ) was studied , and it was proved that the process is recurrent for @xmath5 and transient for @xmath6 . for general random walks in random environment there are conditions sufficient for the random walk to be ballistic ( and , consequently , transient ) , see  @xcite . these conditions , though , normally are not easily verifiable . on the other hand , for the model of the present paper , we give explicit ( and easily verifiable ) conditions for recurrence and transience , that , while failing to produce a complete classification , nevertheless work well in many concrete examples .",
    "also , we give a shape theorem for the set of visited sites in the recurrent case . in terms of random walks in random environment , this case corresponds to nestling walks as well as to non nestling ones with strong enough branching , and the result is once again interesting in view of the law of large numbers for random walks , which relies on some renewal structure and requires specific assumptions in the current literature .    some interesting problems , closely related to shape theorems ,",
    "arise when studying properties of tails of the distributions of first hitting times . here",
    "we show that s in random environment exhibit very different behaviors in dimensions  @xmath7 and @xmath8 from the point of view of hitting time distribution : in the recurrent case , the annealed expectation of hitting times is always finite in @xmath8 , but it is not the case for the one - dimensional model . hitting times for random walks without branching in random environment have motivated a number of papers . tails of hitting times distributions have a variety of different behaviors for random walks in random environment in dimension @xmath7 , they have been extensively studied both under the annealed law @xcite and the quenched law @xcite .",
    "also , in higher dimensions there are results on hitting times of hyperplanes , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "many other interesting topics are left untouched in this paper .",
    "they include shape theorems for the transient case , questions related to the ( global and local ) size of the population , hydrodynamical equations , etc . also , it is a challenging problem to find the right order of decay for the tails of hitting times in dimension @xmath8 , in the recurrent case .",
    "finally , since in our model each particle has at least one descendant , we do not deal at all with extinction , which seems to be a difficult issue in random environment .",
    "an important ingredient in our paper is the notion of seeds , i.e. , local configurations of the environment .",
    "some seeds can create an infinite number of particles without help from outside , potentially enforcing recurrence .",
    "so , as opposed to random walks without branching , the model of the present paper is in some sense more sensible to the local changes in the environment .",
    "together with the fact that more particles means more averaging , this explains why the analysis is apparently easier for the random walks with the presence of branching .",
    "we briefly discuss different , but related , models . a multidimensional ( @xmath6 )  for which the transition probabilities are those of the simple random walk , and the particles can branch only in some special sites ( randomly placed , with a decreasing density ) was considered in  @xcite , and several sufficient conditions for recurrence and transience were obtained .",
    "dimension @xmath7 leads to more explicit results , thanks to the order structure ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in the case",
    "@xmath7 with nearest neighbor jumps , particles have to visit all intermediate locations , and this fact allows to obtain some useful variational formulas @xcite .",
    "the case where particles move on the tree has a similar flavour  @xcite .",
    "the case of inhomogeneous jumps with constant branching rate can be formulated as a tree - indexed random walk . in this case , a complete classification of recurrence / transience is obtained in  @xcite , involving the branching rate and the spectral radius of the transition operator .",
    "the occurrence of shape theorems in the  literature goes back at least to  @xcite .",
    "we now describe the model .",
    "fix a finite set @xmath9 such that @xmath10 for all @xmath11 , where @xmath12-s are the coordinate vectors of @xmath3 . define ( with @xmath13 )",
    "@xmath14 and for @xmath15 put @xmath16 ; note that @xmath17 for all @xmath15 .",

    "the collection @xmath25 is called _",
    "the environment_. given the environment  @xmath26 , the evolution of the process is described in the following way : start with one particle at some fixed site of  @xmath3 . at each integer time",
    "the particles branch independently using the following mechanism : for a particle at site @xmath23 , a random element @xmath27 is chosen with probability @xmath28 , and then the particle is substituted by @xmath29 particles in @xmath30 for all @xmath31 .",
    "note that this notion of  is more general than that of @xcite , since here we do not suppose that the _ immediate _ descendants of a particle jump independently ( for example , we allow situations similar to the following one [ d=1 ] : when a particle in  @xmath32 generates three offsprings , then with probability 1 two of them go to the right and the third one to the left ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath33 the probability and expectation with respect to @xmath26 ( in fact , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 are copies of @xmath22 ) , and by @xmath36 the ( so - called  quenched \" ) probability and expectation for the process starting from  @xmath32 in the fixed environment  @xmath26 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath37 = \\ie\\,\\po^x[\\,\\cdot\\,]$ ] for the annealed law of the branching random walk in random environment , and @xmath38 for the corresponding expectation .",
    "also , sometimes we use the symbols @xmath39 without the corresponding superscripts when it can create no confusion ( e.g.  when the starting point of the process is indicated elsewhere ) .    throughout this paper , and without recalling it explicitly , we suppose that the two conditions below are fulfilled :    * condition b. * @xmath40    * condition e. * @xmath41    condition b ensures that the model can not be reduced to random walk without branching , and condition  e is a natural ellipticity condition which ensures that the walk is really @xmath42-dimensional . in this paper , `` elliptic '' will mean `` strictly elliptic '' .",
    "we will sometimes use the stronger uniform ellipticity condition :    * condition ue . * for some @xmath43 , @xmath44    due to condition b , the population size tends to infinity , and the is always transient as a process on @xmath45 .",
    "so , we intruduce more appropriate notions of recurrence and transience .",

    "the next proposition refines the item  ( ii ) of proposition  [ rec / tr ] :    [ trans_inf ] let us assume that the branching random walk is transient .",

    "it is plain to construct ( see e.g.  the example after the proof of theorem  4.3 in  @xcite ) environments @xmath26 such that @xmath50 $ ] is strictly between 0 and 1 .",
    "the next example show that randomness of the environment is essential for our statements ( and also shows , incidentally , that there is no hope to prove proposition  [ trans_inf ] by arguments of the type `` recurrence should not be sensitive to changes of the environment in finite regions '' ) .",
    "let @xmath51 , and consider two measures @xmath52 :    * under @xmath53 , with probability @xmath54 there is only one child which is located one step to the left and with probability @xmath55 there is only one child which is located one step to the right ; * under @xmath56 , with probability @xmath55 there is only one child which is located one step to the right and with probability @xmath54 there are two children one being located to the right and the other to the left .",
