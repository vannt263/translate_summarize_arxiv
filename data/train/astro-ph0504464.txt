    "we are living in an age of high precision cosmology which offers a possibility of testing exotic physics , which is obvious for the early universe @xcite . in this context",
    "the most important are bbn constraints because the present universe opens only small windows on the exotic physics .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to discuss whether the initial singularity can be checked against the astronomical observations .",
    "the question of singularity can not be answered directly , therefore we use two prototype models based on the classical and quantum gravity theory .",
    "the first is the @xmath0cdm which is a concordance model describing the evolution of the universe from the initial singularity ( the big bang ) driven by the cold dark matter and the cosmological constant ( dark energy ) .",
    "the second is a bouncing model which appears in the context of quantum cosmology and characterized by the lack of initial singularity . during its evolution ,",
    "the expansion phase is proceeded by the contraction phase at the bounce where the scale factor assumes the minimum nonzero value .",
    "we use some tests to discriminate between these two alternative models .",
    "one of the most important tests applies the snia data to fit the cosmological models .",
    "recent measurements of type ia supernovae observations suggest that the universe is presently accelerating @xcite .",
    "a dark energy component has usually been proposed as a source of acceleration mechanism @xcite .",
    "many theoretical propositions have been suggested about these components .",
    "however , the different effects arising from quantum fluctuation , spinning fluid , etc . can also mimic dynamically the role the dark energy which drives acceleration through an additional term in the friedmann equation @xcite . some of them give rise to the bounce . in many cases they prevailed in the very early epoch but",
    "are very small in the present epoch .",
    "therefore it is very difficult to detect the existence of this component in the present and those of the relatively close past ( after cmb ) observations of snia .    in the present work we investigate observational constraints on the evolutionary scenario of the standard bouncing cosmological models defined as a class of models for which the hubble function @xmath7 and the scale factor @xmath8 are related by the formula @xmath9 where @xmath4 and @xmath10 where the index zero denotes the quantities evaluated in the present epoch , the parameter @xmath6 is called the bouncing term ; and the density parameters satisfy the constraint relation @xmath11 while focus mainly on the constraints coming from sn ia data and wmap observations , the complementary constraints coming from bbn and the age @xcite of the oldest high - redshift objects are also considered .",
    "we use the maximum likelihood method to estimate the model parameters @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath6 .",
    "similarly we analyze the models with the additional parameter  the cosmological constant .",
    "it is called the generalized bouncing model .",
    "the proposition of the bounce type evolution of the early universe seems to be very attractive not only from the point of view of the quantum description of the early universe because the expansion of the universe is accelerated automatically due to the presence of the bouncing term .",
    "the standard bouncing scenario predicts the acceleration around the bounce with a transition to the deceleration epoch .",
    "the cosmological constant brings this deceleration epoch to the end and a new acceleration epoch begins .    therefore , these models can be proposed as the models of our universe , because they include the epoch of acceleration .",
    "however we show that the influence of the bouncing term is insignificant in the present epoch .",
    "therefore , the data from the present epoch , such as the snia data , have not power to rsider the model with bouncing term statistically significant .",
    "so the @xmath0cdm model with big - bang scenario is strongly favored by data over the model with the bounce .    by the application of standard akaike criterion of the model selection",
    "we can choose the @xmath0cdm model over the generalized bouncing model .",
    "we conclude that the data fail to support the existence of the bouncing term .",
    "the bouncing term in the present epoch is insignificant and it is not possible to detect its influence by the use the latest snia data .",
    "this fact justifies certain scepticism about the existence of the snia window on exotic physics in the current epoch .",
    "however we can not rule out other models by testing them against the current data .",
    "it is also possible to investigate the differences in the predictions of these models for some earlier epoch .    for example",
    "the bbn epoch is a well tested area of cosmology . from this analysis",
    "we gather that the extra term @xmath14 causing the bounce should be constrained to be sufficiently small during nucleosynthesis .",
    "the organization of the text is the following . in section 2",
    "the evolutionary scenario of bounce frw cosmologies is investigated by the use of dynamic system methods .",
    "we show that they are structurally unstable due to the presence of centers in the phase portraits . in section 3",
    "we discuss the constraints from snia data on the standard bouncing models . in section 4",
    "we extend the bouncing models by introducing the cosmological constant and then we study how these models fit the current supernovae and wmap data . in section 5",
    "we formulate conclusions .",
    "the idea of bounce in frw cosmologies appeared in tolman s monograph devoted to cosmology @xcite .",
    "this idea was strictly connected with oscillating models @xcite . at present oscillating models",
    "play an important role in the brane cosmology @xcite .",
    "the frw universe undergoing a bounce instead of the big - bang is also an appealing idea in the context of quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "the attractiveness of bouncing models comes from the fact that they have no horizon problem and they explain quantum origin of structures in the universe @xcite .",
    "molina - paris and visser and later tippett @xcite characterized the bouncing models by the minimal condition under which the present universe arises from a bounce from the previous collapse phase ( the tolman wormhole is different name for denoting such a type of evolution ) .",
    "the violation of strong energy condition ( sec ) is in general a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for bounce to appear . for closed models",
    "it is sufficient condition and none of other energy condition need to be violated ( like null energy condition ( nec ) : @xmath15 , week energy condition ( wec ) : @xmath16 and @xmath17 , dominant energy condition ( dec ) : @xmath16 and @xmath18 energy conditions can be satisfied ) .",
    "we can find necessary and sufficient conditions for an evolutional path with a bounce by analyzing dynamics on the phase plane ( @xmath19 ) , where @xmath8 is the scale factor and dot denotes differentiation with respect to cosmological time .",
    "we understand the bounce as in @xcite , namely there must be some moment say @xmath20 in evolution of the universe at which the size of the universe has a minimum , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "this weak inequality @xmath23 is enough for giving domains in the phase space occupied by trajectories with the bounce .",
    "let us consider the dynamics of the frw cosmological models filled by perfect fluid with energy density @xmath24 and pressure @xmath25 parameterized by the equation of state in the general form @xmath26    the basic dynamical system constitutes two equations @xmath27 equation ( [ eq:3a ] ) is the rauchadhuri equation while equation ( [ eq:3b ] ) is the conservation condition .",
    "if the equation of state is postulated in the form ( [ eq:2 ] ) then from ( [ eq:3b ] ) we obtain @xmath28 it is interesting that dynamics of the model under consideration can be represented in the analogous form to the newtonian equation of motion @xmath29 where @xmath30 plays the role of potential function for the frw system . therefore different cosmological models are in a unique way characterized by the potential function @xmath31 and we can write down the hamiltonian for the fictitious particle - universe moving in the one - dimensional potential as @xmath32    it is useful to represent eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) in the form of dynamical system @xmath33 where we denote @xmath34 , @xmath35 and system ( [ eq:7 ] ) has the first integral in the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the curvature index .",
    "the critical points of the system ( [ eq:7 ] ) if exist are : @xmath38 , @xmath39 , i.e. they are always static critical points located on @xmath40-axis .",
    "the form of first integral ( [ eq:8 ] ) defines the algebraic curves in the phase plane @xmath41 on which lies solutions of the system .",
    "this solutions are in two types : regular is represented by trajectories or singular is represented by singular solutions for which the right - hand side of ( [ eq:7 ] ) are null ( or @xmath42 for nonflat models ) .",
    "note that the bouncing points are intersections points of trajectories situated in the region of the configuration space in which @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath44 is a decreasing function of @xmath8 or has extrema .",
    "it is well known that the systems in the form ( [ eq:7 ] ) have only critical points of two admissible types : centres if @xmath45 or saddles in opposite case if @xmath46 .",
    "therefore all trajectories with bounce intersect an @xmath40-axis",
    "and then they are situated on the right side from the critical point at which @xmath47 and @xmath22 .",
    "the critical points are represented by points as well as by separatrices of the saddle point . in others words bouncing trajectories",
    "are represented by such trajectories in the phase plane which are passing through the @xmath40-axis in such a direction that they always belong to the accelerating region ( in the neighborhood of bounce ) .",
    "of course it is only possible if the sec is violated .",
    "let us consider some prototype of bouncing models given by the friedmann first integral in the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 are positive constants and @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the hubble function and a dot denotes differentiation with respect to cosmological time @xmath53 .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite ( [ eq:9 ] ) to the new form @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath6 are density parameters for noninteracting fluids which give some contributions to right - hand sides of eq .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) .",
    "we define density parameters @xmath56 , @xmath57 , where an index `` @xmath58 '' means that corresponding quantities are evaluated at the present epoch , @xmath10 is the scale factor expressed in the units of its present value @xmath59 .",
    "after differentiation the both sides of ( [ eq:10 ] ) with respect to the reparameterized time variable @xmath60 , @xmath61 we obtain @xmath62    if we consider the generalization of the bouncing models with the cosmological constant then in both equations ( [ eq:10 ] ) and ( [ eq:11 ] ) the parameter @xmath63 should be added to their right - hand sides .",
    "note that the bouncing models can be treated as the standard frw models with two noninteracting fluids with energy density and pressure in the form @xmath64 the curvature term as well as cosmological constant term can be obtained in an analogous way by putting @xmath65 or @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "if we postulate that the present universe is accelerating , i.e. @xmath67 at @xmath68 then in the general case with the cosmological constant we obtain the following condition @xmath69 because relation ( [ eq:12 ] ) is validate any time , the substitution @xmath70 and @xmath68 to ( [ eq:12 ] ) gives constraint @xmath71 let us now concentrate on the standard bouncing models ( sb ) without the cosmological term . then from ( [ eq:12 ] ) including constraints ( [ eq:13 ] ) we obtain the sufficient condition for acceleration at present @xmath72 where for the case of @xmath73 , @xmath74 @xmath75 is only required for present acceleration .",
    "if only @xmath6 is larger then @xmath55 the bouncing universe is presently accelerating for any @xmath12 , @xmath13 parameters .",
    "it is worthy to mention that condition ( [ eq:14 ] ) is minimal qualitative information about acceleration and the rate of this acceleration is required for explanation snia data .    from the definition([eq:10 ] ) one can obtain the domain admissible for motion of the bouncing models @xmath76 from ( [ eq:10 ] ) the potential function @xmath77 in the particle - like description can be determined @xmath78 where effective density parameter @xmath79 .",
    "the acceleration region in the phase plane can be determined in term of potential function , namely if @xmath80 then universe is accelerating .    from ( [ eq:16 ] )",
    "we obtain result that at the bounce moment @xmath81 which indicate that bouncing models defined by equation ( [ eq:10 ] ) at the bounce are in accelerating phase for any ranges of model parameter @xmath82 . because @xmath83 is larger then @xmath84 the bouncing universe",
    "stay still in the accelerating region .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq:18 ] ) we obtain that the universe start to accelerate at the point @xmath85 such that @xmath86 where a positive value of @xmath87 is required .",
    "note that in any case @xmath88 i.e. , the start of acceleration proceeds the bounce .",
    "the value of @xmath89 determine the location of the critical point of the dynamical system @xmath90 on @xmath40-axis .",
    "the sign of the second derivative of potential function determines the type of critical points ( centre or saddle ) because the eigenvalues of the linearization matrix of the system satisfy the characteristic equation @xmath91 from ( [ eq:16 ] ) we obtain @xmath92 .",
    "\\label{eq:22}\\ ] ]    therefore if @xmath93 belong to the interval @xmath94 then we have centres , while if @xmath93 belong to interval @xmath95 we obtain saddles .",
    "let us concentrate , for example , let us concentrate on the case of @xmath96 ( dust matter ) .",
    "then @xmath97 hence , if @xmath98 we obtain @xmath99 positive which corresponds to the centres in the phase plane .",
    "the presence of centres on the phase portraits means that all bouncing models are oscillating .",
    "let us note , however that the corresponding systems are structurally unstable because of the presence of nonhyperbolic critical points on the phase portraits .",
    "physically it means that the small perturbation of right - hand sides of the system under consideration disturbs a qualitative structure of the orbits ( i.e. a phase portrait ) . on fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and [ eq:2 ] the phase portraits and diagrams of the potential function are presented for the standard and generalized bouncing model .",

    "the classically forbidden region for @xmath100 is shaded .",
    "the evolution of the model is represented in the configuration space by a hamiltonian level @xmath101 the trajectory of the flat model separates the regions occupied by both closed and open models .",
    "the decreasing of the potential function with respect to the scale factor determines the domain of phase space occupied by accelerating trajectories .",
    "the bounce is the intersection point of trajectory with the axis @xmath8 .",
    "note that around the bounce we have acceleration . on the phase plane of hamiltonian dynamical systems only centres and saddle points are admissible .",
    "the centres are structurally unstable while saddles are structurally stable . because the centre appears in the phase portraits of standard and generalized bouncing models , both models are structurally unstable .",
    "the critical points represent the static universes .",
    "generalized bouncing model has two disjoint acceleration regions .",
    "the first is due to bouncing term while the second is forced by the cosmological constant term .",
    ".some special cases of bouncing models [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper we confront the bouncing model with astronomical observations .",
    "we use the constraints from snia data , cmb analysis , and bbn and the age of the oldest high - redshift objects .",
    "the standard bouncing model is excluded statistically at the @xmath5 level .",
    "if we take the extended bouncing model ( with extra @xmath63 term ) then we obtain , as the best - fit , that the parameter @xmath6 is equal to zero which means that the snia data do not support the existence of the bouncing term in the model .",
    "we also demonstrate that bbn gives stringent constraints on the extra term @xmath6 and show that the bounce term is insignificant in the present epoch .",
    "it is interesting that such bouncing models with extra inflationary expansion are presently favored in the loop quantum approach @xcite .",
    "the theory of loop quantum gravity predicts that there is no initial singularity because of the quantum effects in the planck scale .",
    "it is due to the continuum break and granuality of spacetime .",
    "therefore , we consider the model where we assume a small positive value of @xmath6 and estimate the rest of the parameters .",
    "this model is statistically admissible .",
    "however , when we compare this model with the standard @xmath0cdm model applying the akaike criterion , the latter is preferred .",
    "if the energy density is so large then quantum gravity corrections are important at both the big - bang and big - rip .",
    "it is interesting that the classical theory reveals its own boundaries ( i.e. classical singularities ) .",
    "the account of quantum effect avoids not only an initial singularity but allows also to escape from a future singularity @xcite    the avoidance of the initial singularity arises only on the quantum ground because the classical theory of gravity according to the hawking - penrose theorems states that these singularities are essential if only some reasonable conditions on the matter content are fulfilled .",
    "if we assume the classical gravity is obvious during the whole evolution of the universe than there is no reason to introduce the bouncing era . the @xmath0cdm model with the big - bang is a simpler model , while the bouncing model requires to the admittance of observationally unconfirmed assumptions . in this way",
    "occam s razor methodology rules out the generalized bouncing model .",
    "the general conclusion is that the present astronomical data does not support the bouncing cosmology .",
    "we also adopt the methods of dynamic systems for investigating dynamics in the phase space .",
    "the advantages of these methods are that they offer the possibility of the investigation of all evolutional paths for all initial conditions .",
    "we show that the dynamics can be reduced to a two - dimensional hamiltonian system .",
    "we also show structural instability of both the standard and generalized bouncing models .",
    "let us note that the concordance @xmath0cdm models are structurally stable @xcite .",
    "the structural stability is a reasonable condition which should be satisfied by models of real physical processes . from the dynamic investigation",
    "we obtain that all models with the bounce are rather fragile .",
    "it means that any small perturbation of the right - hand sides of the dynamic equations of the model changes the topological structure of the phase space .",
    "the bouncing models in the space of all dynamic system on the plane form non - dense ( zero measure ) subset of this plane following the peixoto theorem .",
