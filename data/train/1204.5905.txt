    "recent years have seen an explosion of interest in two areas that , while distinct in themselves , have also found some areas of overlap .",
    "one is the situation where dirac - weyl linear bands emanate from a point fermi surface ( fs ) , the so - called dirac point . while linear bands around symmetry points are not uncommon in crystal structures , it is uncommon that such points can determine the fermi energy ( e@xmath12 ) , which is what happens in the celebrated case of graphene .",
    "it is necessary that there is a gap throughout the brillouin zone except for the touching bands .",
    "point fss occur also in the case of conventional ( massive ) zero - gap semiconductors,@xcite and give rise to properties that have been studied in some detail .",
    "the case of the dirac - weyl semimetal ( point fermi surface ) systems is quite different,@xcite leading to a great deal of new phenomenology .",
    "the other new and active area relevant to this paper is that of topological insulators ( tis ) , in which the brillouin zone integral of a certain ` gauge field ' derived from the @xmath1-dependence of the periodic part of the bloch states of the crystal is non - vanishing.@xcite these integer - valued topological invariants delineate tis from conventional ( ` trivial ' ) insulators , with distinctive properties that are manifested primarily in edge states.@xcite identification of tis , and study of their properties and the critical point that separates the phases , is highlighting new basic physics and several potential applications .",
    "recently we reported@xcite on the skutterudite structure compound cosb@xmath0 , which combines and interrelates several of these properties ( dirac - weyl semimetal at @xmath1=0 ; critical point of degeneracy with massive bands ; transition to topological insulator ) in a unique way .",
    "the skutterudite structure , which is illustrated in fig . [ structure ] and is discussed in sec .",
    "ii , is critical to the electronic behavior in cosb@xmath0 though it may not be necessary for the unique type of critical point that arises .",
    "the relevant portion of the band structure , in a very small volume of the brillouin zone ( bz ) centered at @xmath13 , is unusually simple compared to most of the tis that have been discovered , @xmath14 the bi@xmath15se@xmath0 class,@xcite , the hgte class,@xcite and the three dimensional system hgcr@xmath15se@xmath16.@xcite    the electronic structure of skutterudites was studied early on by singh and pickett,@xcite who focused on the peculiar valence band which was linear ( except exceedingly near @xmath13 ) and whose linearity extended surprisingly far out into the bz .",
    "it became clear that the linearity of the band was responsible for the large thermopower@xcite that is potentially useful in thermoelectric applications.@xcite the origin of the linearity was however not identified , but it leads to peculiar consequences:@xcite the density of states varies as @xmath17 near the band edge rather than the usual three dimensional ( 3d ) form @xmath18 ; as a consequence the carrier density scales differently with fermi energy @xmath19 ; the inverse mass tensor @xmath20 is entirely off - diagonal corresponding to an `` infinite '' transport mass ; the cyclotron mass differs from conventional 3d behavior , etc . as the sb sublattice",
    "is shifted in a symmetry - preserving way,@xcite the small semiconducting gap of cosb@xmath0 closes at a critical point , giving rise to an unusual occurrence : a dirac - weyl point in a 3d solid at the @xmath13 point .",
    "this transition point sets the stage for a conventional insulator to topological insulator transition , although the specific behavior of the system at this point was not spelled out in our earlier work .",
    "the only other topological insulator phases in skutterudite materials that we are aware of are the examples by jung _ et al._@xcite in ceos@xmath16pn@xmath21 filled skutterudites .    this paper is organized as follows . in section ii the skutterudite structure and its relation to the symmetric perovskite ( reo@xmath0 ) structure is reviewed .",
    "the computational methods are outlined in section iii .",
    "section iv discusses the evolution of the band structure during a perovskite - to - skutterudite transformation , including the development of the gap and the appearance of the linear band .",

    ". a symmetric combination of the four @xmath9 orbitals on a ring , call it @xmath43 , is orthogonal to the @xmath43 orbitals on neighboring rings , so if dispersion is governed by inter - ring hopping ( rather than through co atoms ) some rather flat sb @xmath9 bands should result .",

    "as mentioned , the skutterudite structure is related to the perovskite structure @xmath44pn@xmath0 ( @xmath45 denotes an empty a site ) .",
    "beginning from perovskite , a rotation of the octahedra keeping the pn atoms along the cube faces results in the formation of the ( nearly square ) pn@xmath16 rings , and the pn octahedra become distorted and less identifiable as a structural feature .",

    "the result is a highly metallic state , with no gap or pseudogap near the fermi level .",
    "the important features only arise near the end of the distortion path . for @xmath49=0.75 ( top panel of fig .",
    "[ fromperov ] ) the valence bands have just become disjoint from the conduction band and gap formation is imminent . for @xmath49=0.90 the gap is well formed and the minimum direct gap is emerging at the @xmath13 point .",
    "the unusual high velocity band arising from the @xmath13 point , already striking at @xmath49=0.75 , remains unchanged at this point .",
    "the valence bands are a mass of indecipherable spaghetti .    by @xmath49=0.95 ( bottom panel )",
    "a similarly high velocity band is emerging from the valence bands to the maximum at the @xmath13 point .",
    "at @xmath49=1.0 it becomes clear that it is a partner of the high velocity conduction band , as discussed in our earlier paper@xcite and to which we return in the next section .",
    "no doubt the formation of the gap , _",
    "i.e. _ formation of occupied bonding bands and unoccupied antibonding bands , is behind the stability of the skutterudite structure in the co pnictides class of materials .",
    "the fact that the gap only opens as the sb @xmath5 and @xmath6 bonding - antibonding splitting becomes strong supports the picture that this @xmath54 interaction takes precedence over the co - sb interactions within the cosb@xmath23 unit ; however , these latter interactions ( _ i.e. _ the presence of the co atom ) are necessary for the gap formation .",
    "although in the ` parent ' perovskite system the structure is that of vertex - connected cosb@xmath23 octahedra , in the strongly distorted skutterudite structure the sb@xmath16 rings form a basic structural motif .",
    "these compounds , viz .",
    "cosb@xmath0 , are sometimes characterized as zintl materials in which the sb@xmath16 unit balances the charge of the co unit . within the zintl picture , the charge of the co@xmath55 ion",
    "must be balanced by a ( sb@xmath16)@xmath56 unit : there are only 3/4 as many sb@xmath16 rings as co atoms .",
    "thus there is tension between the zintl picture , which does not lead to integral formal charges on both of the primary units , and the presence of the gap that specifies an integral number of occupied bonding states .",
    "several papers@xcite have presented results and some analysis for empty and for a few filled skutterudites .",
    "we have benefited from the previous work as we proceed on a deeper analysis .",
    "we first follow the commonly held line of reasoning that the short sb - sb distance in the sb@xmath16 ring is the most fundamental aspect of the electronic structure.@xcite the @xmath57 bonding along an @xmath58-axis is characterized by a hopping amplitude @xmath59 3 ev , so the corresponding bonding and antibonding states lie at @xmath60 . the separation of sb atoms and the @xmath7 bonding and antibonding between @xmath6 orbitals along the @xmath61-direction is indistinguishable from that of the @xmath5 @xmath7 case .",
    "indeed , the corresponding @xmath62 bonding and antibonding character ( not shown in figures ) is centered roughly @xmath633 - 4 ev below and above the gap .",
    "the on - site energies @xmath64 therefore lie in the vicinity of the gap .",
    "this picture leads to half - filled @xmath5 and @xmath6 orbitals .",
    "along high symmetry directions , with fatbands highlighting the sb @xmath9 character .",
    "the character is substantial in the -3 to -6 ev region , in the 3 to 5 ev region , but most notably in the linear band extending through the gap , which is primarily @xmath9 in character .",
    "[ pzbands ] , scaledwidth=35.0% ]    the @xmath9 orbitals within an sb@xmath16 unit are orthogonal to the @xmath33 orbitals and couple by a @xmath65 hopping amplitude .",
    "this coupling leads to doubly degenerate levels at @xmath66 relative to @xmath67 .",
    "the evidence is that there is negligible crystal field splitting of the three on - site @xmath68 orbitals .",
    "however , inter - unit @xmath69 interaction will be stronger than this intra - unit coupling , and the @xmath9 orbitals also couple to the co orbitals . the @xmath9 character , provided by the fatbands representation in fig .",
    "[ pzbands ] , is in fact distributed throughout the -6 ev to + 5 ev region and is not reproducible by a simple model due to other couplings .",
    "the @xmath9 projected density of states ( dos ) indicates the @xmath9 orbitals are at least half - filled , perhaps slightly more .",
    "along high symmetry directions , with fatbands highlighting the co @xmath70 character .",
    "this plot reflects a narrow mass of @xmath71 bands throughout the -1 to -2 ev range , more around -3 ev , and @xmath724 unoccupied bands in the 0 - 1 ev range .",
    "the amount of @xmath70 occupation is discussed in the text .",
    "[ cobands ] , scaledwidth=35.0% ]      it is readily demonstrated that analysis focusing primarily on the sb@xmath16 rings has strong limitations . we have performed calculations with the co atom removed , @xmath45sb@xmath0 . the sb @xmath68 band complex is broad ( 10 ev ) and featureless .",
    "there is no hint of a gap or even pseudogap , indicating that the @xmath5 and @xmath6 bonding - antibonding feature described above is far from a dominant feature .",
    "only when co is re - inserted into the structure does the remarkably clean 1 ev gap become carved out around the fermi level , except of course for the peculiar linear band near the zone center .",
    "the gap therefore arises from the co @xmath70 mixing ( evidently strongly ) with sb @xmath73 orbitals , with the linear band emerging from the valence bands being of strong sb character .",
    "figure [ cobands ] illustrates the co @xmath70 character .",
    "it lies mostly below the gap , in the very narrow -1 to -2 ev range . a much smaller amount of character , roughly something like four bands , lies immediately above the gap in the 0 - 1 ev range .",
    "these two parts of the @xmath70 projected dos are neatly and impressively split by the 1 ev gap .",
    "the `` charge state '' ( or formal valence , or oxidation state ) of the co atom is a question that can be asked , since this is an insulating material .",
    "if there are four unoccupied @xmath71 bands ( though this can not be claimed very conclusively due to the strong hybridization ) then considering there are four co atoms in the cell , the occupation would be @xmath3 co@xmath74 . a nonmagnetic ion with this filling is natural for the co @xmath4 site symmetry .",
    "as the cosb@xmath23 octahedron is distorted strongly in progressing from the cubic perovskite structure to the skutterudite one , the crystal field levels reduce as @xmath75 , the latter being the doublet , and @xmath76 .",
    "one unoccupied orbital singlet ( both spins ) gives the @xmath3 occupation .",
    "the magnetic quantum number @xmath77 orbital with respect to the local three - fold axis is the natural one for the @xmath70 holes to occupy .",
    "charge balance will then leave the rings as ( sb@xmath16)@xmath78 , a very unsatisfactory result for accounting for the gap : each sb@xmath16 ring would not have an integer number of ( fully ) occupied bands ( or molecular orbitals ) . within the picture that the @xmath5 and @xmath6 orbitals are half - filled due to the large @xmath54 bonding - antibonding splitting , this co charge state would suggest @xmath9 orbitals to be 1/6 more than half - filled , a peculiar result and one that would only be compatible with a metallic , rather than semiconducting , state .",
    "the integrated dos for the co @xmath70 states in fact gives a clear @xmath3 occupation .",
    "however , with near - neutral atoms there might be significant co @xmath79 occupation , which could bring co nearer to a neutral @xmath80 configuration .",
    "some co @xmath81 character is in fact found in the upper valence bands , though it is possible that this represents tails of sb @xmath68 orbitals .",
    "the co @xmath71 occupation @xmath3 is clear , however .",
    "it was noted above that when co is removed from the structure , there is no gap nor any indication of one , nor any candidate for a potential linear band .",
    "the most direct interaction of the sb @xmath9 orbitals on the ring is between the @xmath9 orbital on the nearest sb in the ring with the rotated @xmath83 orbitals on the eight co neighbors .",
    "sb@xmath23 molecular orbitals ( mos ) formed by linear combinations of @xmath9 orbitals can be sorted according to whether they are even or odd parity with respect to the center of inversion at the co site . the even parity mos mix with the co @xmath70 orbitals , forming bonding and antibonding pairs tending to open a gap ; the odd parity mos do not mix with the @xmath70 orbitals . as a result of this coupling , four of the five @xmath70 orbitals",
    "are lowered and occupied , while one is raised and unoccupied , giving the 1 ev gap and the @xmath3 occupation .      the fatbands representation of sb @xmath9 character in fig .",
    "[ pzbands ] shows the substantial @xmath9 character of the linear band in the upper valence bands near the zone center .",
    "this @xmath9 character is in fact the dominant character , although various other small contributions from other valence orbitals are mixed in by the low sb site symmetry .",
    "the character of the 3-fold degenerate conduction band minimum state is more complex .",
    "these bands have primarily co `` @xmath84 '' character ; the quotes arise from the fact that the degeneracies of the cubic @xmath84 and @xmath85 subshells are broken by the distortion of the octahedra in the skutterudite structure .",
    "there is a strongly @xmath86 flat band just above ( + 0.2 ev ) the gap , and additional strong @xmath87 character in the 0.2 - 0.6 ev region .",
    "the band figures we show below demonstrate that the linear band couples to only one of the triplet of conduction bands at and near @xmath13 , _",
    "i.e. _ couples to only one linear combination of the triplet states .",
    "it does not couple to the co @xmath70 orbitals .",
    "a generalized viewpoint of the most physical orbitals in cosb@xmath0 is that of four co@xmath74 @xmath3 atoms ( as discussed above ) , three sb@xmath16 rings with @xmath5- and @xmath6-@xmath7 bonding states filled and antibonding states unoccupied , and molecular orbitals formed from the twelve @xmath9 orbitals and centered on the empty @xmath10 site .",
    "this site is an inversion center , so the mos can be classified as parity - even or -odd .",
    "( note that these are different mos than were discussed in sec .",
    "twelve mos can be formed , which can be classified also by the tetrahedral @xmath10 site symmetry .",
    "charge counting requires that eight of these mos must be occupied ( with both spins ) .",
    "we will not attempt to identify the positions and dispersions of these mos , except to note that linear band is one of these mos .",
    "et al._@xcite identified this mo as @xmath11 , an orbitally nondegenerate state with odd parity at @xmath1=0 , and therefore not mixing with the co @xmath70 orbitals at ( or near ) @xmath13 .",
    "the density arising from this orbital is of interest .",
    "we had earlier investigated the possibility that an electron may reside in the large empty @xmath10 site in the skutterudite structure .",
    "this type of `` electride '' configuration , in which an interstitial electron without a nucleus becomes an anion , is well established in molecular solids.@xcite however , the density at the @xmath10 site is very small , ruling out this possibility .",
    "an isosurface plot of the density arising from the linear band near @xmath13 is shown in fig . [ density ] .",
    "the closed surface in the density encloses a region of _ low density _ centered on the unoccupied site .",
    "exploring the density with isosurfaces at various values of density reveals no local maximum at this large interstitial site , thus no electride - like character .",
    "lefebvre - devos _ et al .",
    "_ have presented@xcite complementary isosurface density plots of this band , with the high density regions of two types .",
    "one region surrounds the empty site ( with rather complex shape ) consistent with its origin as a mo comprised of @xmath9 sb@xmath16 ring states , with the tetrahedral symmetry of the @xmath10 site .",
    "the second region is within each cosb@xmath23 octahedron , centered on either side of the co atom along the local @xmath4 axis , appearing as a three - bladed propeller that arises from the lobes of the @xmath9 orbitals that lie closer to the co atom .",
    "interaction of the @xmath9 states with co @xmath70 orbitals appears to cause a majority of the density of this state to border the large empty site .",
    "the result is not an electride state but rather a large molecular orbital ( one of twelve in total ) centered on the empty site , with one of them ( @xmath11 ) per primitive cell .",
    "we have previously reported that this state at @xmath13 is parity - odd.@xcite such an orbital has the same hopping amplitude @xmath88 along each nearest neighbor direction on a @xmath89 lattice , hence its dispersion looks like that of an @xmath49 orbital , @xmath90 = 8@xmath88 cos(@xmath91 ) cos(@xmath92 ) cos(@xmath93 ) , and does not lead to a linear band at @xmath1=0 . this should nt be surprising , as the true linearity at @xmath13 is accidental , due to a degeneracy that has to be tuned . in our previous paper,@xcite",
    "this tuning was accomplished by making two on - site energies in the tight - binding model identical .",
    "the `` linear band '' aspect of the skutterudites may have been over - interpreted , because it arose in the most common member ( the mineral skutterudite coas@xmath0 ) which was studied most heavily initially . in a general skutterudite , for example",
    "the filled one lafe@xmath16p@xmath21 , the same band rises out of the valence band complex but is not unduly `` linear . ''",
    "the isovalent members xpn@xmath0 , with x = co , rh , ir , and pnictides pn = as and sb , all seem to lie not far from the critical degeneracy that extends the band linearly to @xmath1=0 ; however , we know of nothing in general about the skutterudite crystal structure that otherwise promotes a linear band .",
    "in previous work@xcite we demonstrated that it is possible , with very small sb sublattice displacement ( see sec .",
    "ii for the linear distortion , characterized by the parameter @xmath49 ) , for this band to remain linear all the way to @xmath1=0 , marking a critical point . in that work ,",
    "the progression of the band crossing at the critical point was plotted . due to",
    "the 3-fold degeneracy of the conducting band edge , the progression versus @xmath49 was from semiconductor for @xmath94 , to the critical point at @xmath49=1.020 with linear _ valence and conduction _ bands degenerate with two quadratic bands , to a zero - gap semiconductor for @xmath95 due to a symmetry - determined degeneracy , even when spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) is included . due to the band inversion and the character of the states at @xmath13 ,",
    "the transition is from trivial insulator to one with topological character .",
    "because the degeneracy at the point fermi surface ( at @xmath13 ) remains , the latter state is a topological zero - gap semiconductor rather than a topological insulator .",
    "we now demonstrate that a simple tetragonal distortion , such as might result from growth on a substrate with small lattice mismatch , does produce a topological insulator ( ti ) but with an unexpected placement of the gap .",
    "the progression of the band structure very near @xmath13 is shown in figure [ transform ] for strain @xmath96=1.01 .",
    "the gap before the critical point is reached always has quadratic bands for sufficiently small @xmath1 . at the critical point @xmath97 ( when the strain is imposed )",
    "leads , unexpectedly , to linear bands only in certain of the high symmetry directions ( such as the @xmath98 direction , toward the p point ) .",
    "in other high symmetry directions ( from @xmath13 toward h is pictured ) the bands are quadratic and the upper one is quite flat ( heavy mass ) .",
    "we return to this point in the next subsection .    beyond the critical point ,",
    "the four bands become non - degenerate once more ; the lower ( linear ) band has crossed the lowest of the three conduction bands and acquired mixed character .",
    "the coupling between bands is clearly much smaller along the axes ( @xmath13-h direction ) than along the other symmetry lines , and the gap occurs along this direction . because of the heavy mass of the lower conduction bands , the gap is quite small , being of the order of 1 mev for the tetragonal strain that is pictured in fig .",
    "[ transform ] .      inspecting the bands along the three cubic high symmetry directions ,",
    "a second peculiar feature becomes evident .",
    "at the critical point , the `` linear band '' disperses linearly along the @xmath98 directions , while they are quadratic ( with distinct masses ) along both the @xmath99 and @xmath100 directions .",
    "the directional dependence as well as the magnitude dependence of the wavevector is anomalous .",
    "the form of the dispersion for small @xmath101 can be constructed .",
    "a polynomial in the direction of @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) with cubic symmetry that vanishes along the @xmath99 directions can be constructed as @xmath104 where \\{@xmath105 } are the six @xmath99 unit vectors .",
    "the denominator normalizes the polynomial to unity along each of the @xmath98 directions ; @xmath106 lies along the @xmath98 direction ( any of them ) . the analogous polynomial @xmath107 that vanishes along each @xmath100 direction and is normalized to unity along each @xmath98 direction can be constructed .",
    "then the peculiar band pair is given by @xmath108 where @xmath109 serve as symmetric and antisymmetric masses .",
    "we have studied the band structures of antimonide sisters of cosb@xmath0 , based on the transition metal atoms rh and ir .",
    "band structures , or sometimes only gap values , of these compounds have been reported earlier.@xcite the band structures around the gap at @xmath1=0 differ somewhat in the literature , due to sensitivity to structure ( and that some use relaxed coordinates while others use the measured structure ) , to the level of convergence of the calculation , and the exchange - correlation functional .",
    "the difference in lattice constant is compensated very closely by the effect of difference in interatomic distances on hopping amplitudes , and the resulting bands are very similar .",
    "the single feature of interest is the magnitude of the gap ( and whether positive or negative , the latter giving an inverted band structure ) and the strength of soc effects .",
    "as mentioned above , band inversion alone does not in itself give rise to a topological insulator state in these compounds because even after soc is included , a two - fold degeneracy at @xmath13 is lowest and the system is a point fermi surface , zero - gap semiconductor .",
    "such cases are referred to as topological semimetals .",
    "however as shown above , the topological semimetal can be driven into the ti phase by tetragonal distortion that lifts the final degeneracy .",
    "_ rhsb@xmath0 .",
    "_ for a range of volumes around the experimental one ( @xmath28= 9.23  ) , this compound has an inverted band structure , hence it is a point fermi surface , zero - gap topological semimetal . in the inverted band structure before considering soc , the singlet lies 23 mev above the triplet that pins the fermi level .",
    "inclusion of soc leaves the fermi energy pinned to a doublet .",
    "a tetragonal distortion raises the degeneracy ; a topological insulator is obtained for @xmath110 in the same way that happens for cosb@xmath0 although no sublattice strain is required in rhsb@xmath0 .",
    "generally , reducing volume ( applying pressure ) in these sb - based skutterudites leads to a larger gap . in the case of rhsb@xmath0 ,",
    "our calculations indicate a gap never actually opens within cubic symmetry , for peripheral reasons . when the band inversion at @xmath13 is undone and a gap at @xmath13 appears at sufficiently high pressure ( a= 9.06  ) , the material is metallic due to other ( rh @xmath111 ) bands having become lowered in energy , crossing the fermi level along the @xmath13-n direction .",
    "_ irsb@xmath0_. the larger soc for heavier atoms led us to consider this @xmath112 compound .",
    "however , the linear band and several others have practically no metal atom character and are not affected by its spin - orbit strength .",
    "we obtain , using the same computational methods as for the other two compounds , that like cosb@xmath0 , irsb@xmath0 has a @xmath7280 mev gap and therefore no topological character at the experimental equilibrium structure .",
    "like cosb@xmath0 , it can be driven to an inverted band structure and hence topological character by internal and tetragonal strains .",
    "one goal of this work was to provide a simple but faithful picture of the electronic structure of cosb@xmath0 : the origin of the gap and the character of the linear band being the most basic .",
    "the picture is this .",
    "co is in a @xmath3 configuration , leaving four electrons in the co@xmath16sb@xmath21 unit cell to go into other bands .",
    "the @xmath5 and @xmath6 orbitals on the sb@xmath16 ring form strongly bonding ( occupied ) and antibonding ( unoccupied ) states , accounting for two of the three @xmath73 electrons of each sb atom , for a total of twelve occupied @xmath7-bonding states ( of each spin ) . the twelve @xmath113-oriented @xmath9 orbitals couple between units as well as with the co @xmath70 orbitals , and form `` molecular orbitals '' centered on the vacant @xmath10 sites in the skutterudites lattice .",
    "eight of these mos are occupied by 16 electrons , one from each sb and one from each co. the linear band is best pictured as arising from the coupling and dispersion of these mos .",
    "we have also justified our earlier statement@xcite that cosb@xmath0 is very near a conventional - to - topological transition . a small symmetry - preserving internal strain , a small applied tetragonal strain , and spin - orbit coupling drives cosb@xmath0 into a topological insulator phase .",
    "this critical point also marks a point of accidental ( but tunable , by the strains ) degeneracy that gives rise to emergence of linear dirac - weyl bands emanating from @xmath1=0 , where they are degenerate with massive bands . at this critical point ,",
    "the dispersion is non - analytic at @xmath1=0 and anisotropy is extreme , with the mass varying from normal to vanishing . in this respect cosb@xmath0 at its critical point bears several similarities to the semi - dirac ( dirac - weyl ) behavior encountered@xcite in ultrathin layers of vo@xmath15 .",

    "<S> 106 , 056401 ( 2011 ) ] that the skutterudite structure compound cosb@xmath0 displays a unique band structure with a topological transition versus a symmetry - preserving sublattice ( sb ) displacement very near the structural ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the transition is through a massless dirac - weyl semimetal , point fermi surface phase which is unique in that ( 1 ) it appears in a three dimensional crystal , ( 2 ) the band critical point occurs at @xmath1=0 , and ( 3 ) linear bands are degenerate with conventional ( massive ) bands at the critical point ( before inclusion of spin - orbit coupling ) . </S>",
    "<S> further interest arises because the critical point separates a conventional ( trivial ) phase from a topological phase . in the native cubic structure </S>",
    "<S> this is a zero - gap topological semimetal ; we show how spin - orbit coupling and uniaxial strain converts the system to a topological insulator ( ti ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyze the origin of the linear band in this class of materials , which is the characteristic that makes them potentially useful in thermoelectric applications or possibly as transparent conductors . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize the formal charge as co@xmath2 @xmath3 , consistent with the gap , with its @xmath4 site symmetry , and with its lack of moment . </S>",
    "<S> the sb states are characterized as @xmath5 ( separately , @xmath6 ) @xmath7-bonded @xmath8 ring states occupied and the corresponding antibonding states empty . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining ( locally ) @xmath9 orbitals form molecular orbitals with definite parity centered on the empty @xmath10 site in the skutterudite structure . </S>",
    "<S> eight such orbitals must be occupied ; the one giving the linear band is an odd orbital singlet @xmath11 at the zone center . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the provocative linearity of the band within the gap is a consequence of the aforementioned near - degeneracy , which is also responsible for the small band gap . </S>"
