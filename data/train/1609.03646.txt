    "this function can be established by equilibrating the isolated system with different values of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 and measuring or computing @xmath17 for each set of these parameters .",
    "the function @xmath18 is called the fundamental equation@xcite and incapsulates _ all _ thermodynamic properties of the substance . the temperature , pressure and chemical potential are defined by the fundamental equation as the derivatives @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "suppose the isolated system is still in the process of relaxation .",
    "while @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are fixed , other thermodynamic properties can vary . if we mentally partition the system into relatively small subsystems , their parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 can vary during the relaxation .",
    "it is important to recognize that the relaxation time @xmath22 of a small subsystem is much shorter than @xmath16 of the entire system , at least for short - range interatomic forces .",
    "thus , there is a certain timescale @xmath23 such that @xmath24 on which the small subsystems remain infinitely close to equilibrium , even though the entire system is not in full equilibrium .",
    "the subsystems weakly interact with each other across their interfaces , causing a slow drift of the entire system towards equilibrium .",
    "such virtually equilibrium subsystems are called _ _ quasi - equilibrium__@xcite and the entire isolated system is said to be in a quasi - equilibrium state . on the quasi - equilibrium timescale @xmath23",
    ", the isolated system can be thought of as equilibrated in the presence of isolating walls separating its small subsystems .",
    "accordingly , each quasi - equilibrium subsystem @xmath25 can be described by a fundamental equation @xmath26 , from which the local temperature , pressure and chemical potential can be found by @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively . if the number of subsystems is large enough , we can talk about spatially continuous temperature , pressure and chemical potential fields .",
    "such fields appear in the standard treatments of irreversible thermodynamics@xcite and are only defined on the quasi - equilibrium timescale .",
    "they evolve during the relaxation process and eventually become uniform when the entire system reaches equilibrium .    following the fluctuation - dissipation concepts,@xcite",
    "one can expect that similar quasi - equilibrium states arise during equilibrium fluctuations in an isolated system .",

    "fluctuations generally occur on all timescales",
    ". however , if we monitor the system properties averaged over the timescale @xmath23 , then we can talk about fluctuations of its intensive parameters .",
    "in particular , quasi - equilibrium fluctuations that preserve the system volume and number of particles ( canonical ensemble ) include well - defined temperature fluctuations .",
    "as long as the temperature is properly defined on the quasi - equilibrium timescale , it will satisfy the fluctuation relation ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "we next apply these concepts to a crystalline solid comprising a fixed number of atoms @xmath31 .",
    "the local relaxation timescale @xmath22 can be identified with a typical phonon lifetime .",
    "suppose the solid is isolated and in equilibrium .",
    "its instantaneous potential energy @xmath32 and kinetic energy of the centers of mass of the particles @xmath33 fluctuate whereas the total energy @xmath34 is strictly fixed .",
    "the timescale @xmath35 of the kinetic ( as well as potential ) energy fluctuations is the inverse of a typical phonon frequency @xmath36 : @xmath37 . assuming that the solid is nearly harmonic , this timescale is much shorter than @xmath22 .",
    "the temperature of the solid is fixed at @xmath38 and can be evaluated from the equipartition relation @xmath39 by monitoring the kinetic energy over a long time @xmath40 .",
    "if the same solid is now connected to a thermostat , two types of fluctuation occur .",
    "first , the same fluctuations as in the isolated system , including the energy exchanges between the phonon modes on the @xmath22 timescale .",
    "second , there will be fluctuations in the total energy of the solid due to energy exchanges between the solid and the thermostat .",
    "the two types of fluctuation are governed by physically different relaxation processes : phonon scattering inside the solid in the first case and heat flow between the solid and the thermostat in the second .",
    "the respective relaxation times , @xmath22 and @xmath16 , are significantly different .",
    "usually @xmath41 , i.e. , the energy exchanges with the thermostat occur on a much longer timescale that depends on the system size , the system / thermostat interface and other factors .",
    "thus , there is a timescale @xmath23 in between , @xmath30 , on which the solid remains quasi - equilibrium and can be assigned a well - defined temperature .",

    "we emphasize that eq.([eq:5 ] ) defines @xmath5 independently of the instantaneous or average values of the total energy and makes no reference to the specific heat of the substance . but do not appear in eq.([eq:5 ] ) , which only includes the kinetic energy of the centers of mass . ] instead , the temperature fluctuations can be used to _ extract _ the specific heat @xmath7 . for",
    "a classical harmonic solid composed of atoms ( not a molecular crystal ) , @xmath46 and eq.([eq:1 ] ) becomes    @xmath47",
    "the key point of this treatment is that the kinetic energy of the centers of mass of the particles must be averaged over the appropriate timescale .",
    "we caution against using the `` instantaneous temperature '' defined by the instantaneous value of the kinetic energy as @xmath48 , as is often done in the md community .",
    "the `` temperature '' @xmath49 so defined essentially represents the kinetic energy @xmath50 itself up to units .",
    "although this unit conversion can sometimes make the md results look more intuitive , it fails to predict the correct temperature fluctuations . using the standard canonical distribution , it is easy to show that for any classical system@xcite @xmath51 from which @xmath52 for an atomic solid , this equation is off by a factor of two .",
    "consequently , the specific heat of the solid extracted from eq.([eq:1 ] ) using the `` instantaneous temperature '' @xmath49 is @xmath53 instead of the correct @xmath54 .    in spite of the failure of the `` instantaneous temperature '' @xmath49 to describe the mean - square fluctuation of temperature , it does satisfy some other fluctuation relations , including eq.([eq:2 ] ) which then becomes @xmath55 . like the energy variance @xmath56",

    "the md simulations were performed with the lammps code@xcite with the time integration step of @xmath58 ps . except for the system in a `` natural thermostat '' discussed later ,",
    "all simulations were conducted in a cubic simulation block with periodic boundary conditions . the block edge was 7.23 nm and the total number of atoms was @xmath59 .",
    "the block edges were aligned with @xmath60 directions of the crystal lattice .",
    "the simulation temperature was chosen to be @xmath61 k and the lattice parameter was adjusted to ensure that the solid was stress - free at this temperature .    prior to studying thermal fluctuations , two types of additional simulations",
    "were performed to generate data needed for a comparison with fluctuation results .",
    "firstly , the phonon density of states @xmath62 at 100 k was computed by the method developed by kong@xcite and implemented in lammps .",
    "this method was chosen because it does not rely on fluctuations and provides independent results for comparison . secondly , to test the accuracy of the simulation methodology , the specific heat of the solid was computed by a direct ( non - fluctuation ) method .",
    "this was accomplished by running canonical ( nvt ) md simulations at the temperatures of 50 , 100 and 150 k and calculating the average energies @xmath63 .",
    "the volume was fixed at the value corresponding to 100 k. the energy was found to follow a linear temperature dependence in this temperature interval , from which the derivative @xmath64 was evaluated by a linear fit .",
    "the specific heat at 100 k was then found from the equation @xmath65 .",
    "the number obtained was @xmath66 j/(mol  k ) , which is close to the equipartition theorem prediction @xmath67 j/(mol  k ) .",
    "the subsequent md simulations utilized two ensembles : the microcanonical nve ( isolated system ) and canonical nvt ( system in a thermostat ) .",
    "the nve system was prepared so that the temperature evaluated from the relation @xmath68 was very close to 100 k. in the nve ensemble , the md simulation simply integrates the classical equations of motion with a hamiltonian dictated by the interatomic potential .",
    "the nvt simulations utilized the langevin thermostat built into lammps.@xcite the langevin algorithm@xcite mimics a thermostat by treating the atoms as if they were embedded in an artificial viscous medium composed of much smaller particles .",
    "this medium exerts a drag force as well as a stochastic noise force @xmath69 that constantly perturbs the atoms .",
    "the total force on atom @xmath70 is    @xmath71    here , @xmath72 is the potential energy due to atomic interactions , and @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are , respectively , the mass , position and velocity of atoms @xmath70 .",
    "the drag term depends on the damping constant @xmath76 , the inverse of which controls the timescale @xmath16 of the energy exchanges between the solid and the thermostat . during the simulation , the noise @xmath77",

    "it has been shown that fluctuations of the temperature so defined do follow eq.([eq:1 ] ) .",
    "attempts to define temperature through kinetic energy averaged over shorter ( @xmath178 ) or longer ( @xmath179 ) time intervals result in significant deviations from eq.([eq:1 ] ) .    the timescale separation is also reflected in the shape of the kinetic energy acf in the frequency domain , showing two peaks separated by a frequency gap .",
