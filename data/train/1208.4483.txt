    "( see also @xcite ) , it has been proven that given @xmath27 for all energy @xmath28 , one can uniquely reconstruct the potential .",

    ", it is known that only one arbitrarily fixed energy @xmath31 is sufficient to reconstruct the compactly supported ( and also exponentially decaying ) potential @xmath32 from the s - matrix @xmath25 .",
    "this was proved for @xmath33 in 1980 s by sylvester - uhlmann @xcite , nachman @xcite , khenkin - novikov @xcite .",
    "there are two methods .",
    "one way is applicable to the compactly supported potential and based on the equivalence of the s - matrix and the dirichlet - neumann map ( called d - n map hereafter ) for the boundary value problem in a bounded domain .",
    "the other way relies on faddeev s theory for the multi - dimensional inverse scattering , in particular , on feddeev s scattering amplitude , and allows exponentially decaying potentials . in both cases ,",
    "sylvester - uhlmann s complex geometrical optics solutions to the schrdinger equation , or faddeev s exponentially growing green function played a crucial role .",
    "( see e.g. an expositiory article @xcite . )",
    "however , since both of these methods use the complex born approximation , the case @xmath34 remained open rather long time .",
    "note that for the potential of the form coming from ellectric conductivities , the 2-dim . inverse scattering problem for a fixed energy was solved by nachman @xcite .",

    "see @xcite .",
    "this result can be applied to the inverse scattering and to derive an affirmative answer to the uniqueness of the potential for given potential of fixed energy .      to study the inverse scattering from a fixed energy for the discrete model",
    ", we adopt the above - mentioned former approach .",
    "namely , we assume that the potential is compactly supported , and derive the equivalence of the s - matrix and the d - n map in a bounded domain .",
    "we need to restrcit the energy in some interval .",
    "let @xmath35 the following theorem is our main aim .",
    "[ main theorem ] fix @xmath36 arbitrarily .",
    "then from the s - matrix @xmath25 , one can uniquely reconstruct the potential @xmath10 .",
    "our proof not only states the uniqueness , but also explains the procedure of the reconstuction of the potential .",
    "after the preparation of basic spectral results in  2 and  3 , the first task is to relate the s - matrix with the far - field pattern at infinity of the generalized eigenfunction of @xmath17 .",
    "this is done in  4 by observing the asymptotic expansion at infinity of the green operator of @xmath17 . in  5 , we introduce the radiation condition for the helmholtz equation and prove the uniqueness theorem for the solution .",
    "we then study the spectral theory for the exterior problem in  6 , with the aid of which we obtain in  7 the equivalence of the s - matrix and the d - n map for a boundary value problem in a bounded domain .",
    "the potential is then reconstructed from the d - n map in  8 via a constructive procedure .",
    "although the main stream of the proof is the same as the continuous case , we need to be careful about the difference in the case of the discrete model .",
    "the first one is the asymptotic expansion of the resolvent at infinity .",
    "this is based on the stationary phase method on the surface @xmath37 defined by ( [ s1mlambda ] ) , which is not strictly convex in general .",
    "this is the reason we restrict the energy on @xmath38 .",
    "the second one , which is more serious , occurs when we compare the far - field patterns of solutions to schrdinger equations in the whole space with those of the exterior domain .",
    "we need a rellich type theorem ( see theorem [ rellictype ] ) and a unique continuation property for the discrete helmholtz equation , which do not seem to be well - known .",
    "however , the former s precursor has been given by shaban - vainberg @xcite , and the latter follows rather easily from it . as a byproduct",
    ", it proves the non - existence of embedded eigenvalues for @xmath17 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we then go into the final step of computing the potential from the d - n map . in the continuous case , this is an elliptic cauchy problem from the boundary , hence is ill - posed .",
    "however , in the discrete case , this is a finite dimensional problem , therefore a finite computational procedure .",
