    "supersonic outflows from young stellar objects ( ysos ) are often seen at optical wavelengths as herbig - haro ( hh ) objects .",
    "hh objects are produced by shocks from the collision of the outflow with the external medium or with previously ejected outflow components , producing collisionally excited forbidden lines . in the optical ,",
    "they can be readily identified by their h@xmath0 and [ s  ii ] line emission , non - stellar appearance , and nearly collinear alignment .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite for a more detailed discussion . despite their distinctive characteristics",
    ", hh objects can be difficult to find in the dense , complex environment in which ysos are forming . in this paper",
    "we report on the search for hh objects in the regions of and ( b175 ) .",
    "is a reflection nebula illuminated by the herbig be star .",
    "it is embedded in a giant molecular cloud complex known as the  cepheus flare \" shell @xcite and is on the northern edge of the @xmath1 complex . the measured distance",
    "to hd  200775 via _ hipparcos _ parallax is @xmath2 pc @xcite , which we adopt here ; although @xcite and references therein argue for other distances .",
    "no prior discoveries of hh objects in ngc  7023 have been reported .",
    "b175 , which is also embedded in the cepheus flare , is a cometary - shaped bok globule .",
    "it is illuminated on the southern edge by the b9.5v type star , producing the reflection nebula .",
    "the distance to b175 is estimated to be at a distance of about 400pc ; see @xcite for discussion .",
    "@xcite also report the discovery of embedded in ced  201 .",
    "it is the only known hh object within b175 .",
    "ngc  7023 and b175 were observed with the mosaic camera on the mayall 4-meter telescope at kitt peak national observatory .",
    "mosaic is an optical camera that consists of eight 2048@xmath34096 ccd detectors arranged to form a 8192@xmath38192 array with 35 to 50-pixel - wide gaps between the ccds . with a scale of @xmath4 pixel@xmath5 ,",
    "the field of view is approximately @xmath6 . to fill in the gaps and bad columns ,",
    "all observations are completed in a five - exposure dither pattern with offsets of approximately 100 pixels .",
    "observations of ngc  7023 were obtained on 29 august 2009 with the harris @xmath7 ( mosaic filter k1002 ) , harris @xmath8 ( k1003 ) ,  nearly - mould \" @xmath9 ( k1005 ) and h@xmath0 ( k1009 ) filters .",
    "five exposures each of 600  sec in @xmath7 , 420  sec in @xmath8 , 300  sec in @xmath9 and 600  sec in h@xmath0 were obtained .",
    "excellent seeing of @xmath10 in h@xmath0 was achieved .",
    "after the outflows were first detected in ngc  7023 , follow - up observations were completed in [ s  ii ] ( ha16 , h - alpha+16 nm , k1013 ) on 21 june 2012 .",
    "five exposures of 600  sec in [ s  ii ] were obtained .",
    "unfortunately the seeing was @xmath11 ; but it was sufficient for confirmation purposes .",
    "observations of b175 were obtained on 23 october 2011 with the @xmath7 ( k1002 ) , @xmath8 ( k1003 ) , @xmath9 ( k1005 ) and h@xmath0 ( k1009 ) filters .",
    "five exposures each of 480  sec in @xmath7 , 300  sec in @xmath8 , 180  sec in @xmath9 and 600  sec in h@xmath0 were obtained .",
    "seeing of 11 in h@xmath0 was achieved .    at the time of the august 2009 observations mosaic",
    "was equipped with thinned , science - grade site ccd cameras . in the summer of 2012 mosaic",
    "was upgraded to eight thinned , science - grade e2v ccds .",
    "the observations of b175 and follow - up [ s  ii ] observations of ngc  7023 were therefore obtained after the upgrade .",
    "both ccd types have 15  pixels ; thus the pixel scales of the ccds are nearly identical .",
    "and the dqes of the two cameras are very similar at the wavelength range of interest ( at 6500 , an average of 86% for the site chips and 80% for the e2v chips ) .",
    "the bandpasses of the h@xmath0 ( k1009 ) and [ s  ii ] ( k1013 ) filters are @xmath12 , with transmission efficiencies of @xmath13 at @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "thus they should be roughly equivalent in sensitivity to h@xmath0 and [ s  ii ] emission .",
    "the data were reduced with the iraf package mscred in the standard manner .",
    "ten bias frames and five dome flats in each filter were used .",
    "the world coordinate system ( wcs ) was determined via stars from the usno - b1.0 catalog @xcite with a global solution rms of better than @xmath16 in all cases .",
    "this is assumed as the accuracy for all measured positions .",
    "all of the images were projected to a common wcs to remove geometric distortions and to allow for the images to be aligned .",
    "the images in each filter were then combined to fill in the gaps .",
    "as a means of visualizing the structure , the data for each object were combined to form a color - composite image with the methodology described in @xcite .",
    "an advantage of searching for hh objects in a color - composite image is that the h@xmath0 emission is distinct and readily visible if assigned a unique color .",
    "further , the broadband filters reveal the amount of obscuration from dust and gas .",
    "thus , faint outflows can be found more easily in the complex environments typical of star - forming regions .",
    "the results for each object are discussed below .",
    "a region 365 @xmath3 363 in size , centered on the location @xmath17 was searched for new hh objects .",
    "at least two distinct outflows were discovered in the northwestern  lobe \" of ngc  7023 .",
    "four new hh objects are labeled in figure  [ fig-1 ] .",
    "all of the hh objects are visible in the h@xmath0 and [ s  ii ] filters , but are not detected in the broadband filters .",
    "thus we are confident they are sources of line emission only .",
    "the objects were named in order of increasing right ascension . when objects are clearly part of the same outflow ( e.g. , hh  1067 ) they share a single hh number .",
    "when it is uncertain if individual knots are part of the same flow , they are given separate hh numbers .",
    "their coordinates are given in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the given positions correspond to the brightest knot in each object .",
    "figures  [ fig-2 ] and [ fig-3 ] show the h@xmath0 and [ s  ii ] images for each object .",
    "no yso progenitors are seen in the optical .",
    "however , @xcite completed a survey of the cepheus flare for yso candidates with the _ spitzer _ irac and mips cameras . in the western lobe of ngc  7023 they identified",
    " tight group b \" in the region of our newly discovered outflows .",
    "the group consists of four ysos with an associated bubble structure detected at 3.6 and 4.5 .",
    "based upon their infrared spectral indices , @xcite classify all four of the ysos in tight group b as embedded ",
    "class i \" protostars .",
    "the irac archival data ( aor  25037312 ) of this region are shown in figure  [ fig-4 ] . the hh1067 outflow between components",
    "a and b , as well as hh1069 and hh1070 , are visible at 3.6 and 4.5 .",
    "this is consistent with deeply embedded sources , as emission at these wavelengths is enhanced in molecular shocks at relatively high temperatures or densities as compared to 5.8 and 8  emission @xcite .",
    "hh1068 is not in the field of view of the irac observations .",
    "hh1067 appears to be a bipolar outflow with an origin in tight group b , whose position is marked in figure  [ fig-1 ] . in both the optical and infrared , hh1067a and hh1067b are clearly connected by a faintly visible and gently curved segmented line that runs through the group and points towards hh1067c .",
    "hh1067c may be a termination shock , as its structure is nearly perpendicular to the structure of hh1067b and no hh objects are seen to the west of hh1067c .",
    "it is not clear which , if any , of the four ysos detected in the group is the progenitor for this outflow .",
    "hh1068 , hh1069 and hh1070 are also roughly collinear with tight group b. the structure of hh1070 strongly suggests a bow shock with an origin in the direction of this group .",
    "it is also not clear which yso is the progenitor of this outflow .",
    "however it is worth noting that hh1069 and hh1070 are equidistant and collinear with yso # 100 as identified in @xcite , suggesting that both hh objects were produced by that object as part of the same ejection event .",
    "if hh1068 is also part of this outflow , the angular distance between yso candidate # 100 and hh1068 is 357 . assuming a distance to ngc  7023 of 430pc , this is a projected distance of 0.75pc , which is a notable length for an embedded outflow . assuming a transverse motion of 100 km s@xmath5 of the outflow implies a dynamical age of about 7500 yr .",
    "if hh1068 , hh1069 and hh1070 are components of a bipolar outflow , then the yso is likely precessing in a manner similar to @xcite .",
    "the hh1068-hh1070 outflow appears to be embedded within or behind the reflection nebulosity of ngc  7023 , as both hh1069 and hh1070 are visible in cavities . hh1068 and the western half of hh1070 are fainter and appear to be partially obscured by dust and gas visible in the broadband filters .",
    "the overall structure observed in ngc  7023 is indicative of two distinct outflows with a common origin .",
    "it is similar in appearance to the and cloud core @xcite .",
    "since they are seen as nearly perpendicular , it is hard to envision a scenario where hh1067 is produced by the same progenitor as hh1068 - 70 , although it could be a binary system . because hh1067 is visible along most of the outflow",
    ", it suggests that it is on the near edge of the ngc  7023 nebula and therefore is likely closer than the hh1068-hh1070 outflow .",
    "a region 406 @xmath3 363 in size , centered on the location @xmath18 was searched for new hh objects .",
    "the field of b175 is particularly interesting because it contains the outflow as well as the supernova remnant , both discovered by @xcite .",
    "no new hh objects were found in b175 .",
    "however , we do reclassify a small filament located between hh  450 and two large filaments of snr  g110.3 + 11.3 .",
    "@xcite originally classified this filament as hh  450x and interpret it as evidence of interaction between the hh outflow and the supernova remnant .",
    "unlike hh  450 and snr  g110.3 + 11.3 , which are detected only in h@xmath0 , we detect hh  450x in all of the broadband and narrowband filters , indicating it is a continuum source . based upon its colors and morphology ( figure  [ fig-5 ] )",
    "we reclassify hh  450x as a background galaxy . the discovery that hh  450x is not a shock front eliminates a key piece of evidence that there is a physical connection between b175 and snr  g110.3 + 11.3 and makes their relationship less clear .",
