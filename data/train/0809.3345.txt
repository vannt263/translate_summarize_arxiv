    "in particular , the theoretical results are used to propose experiments for measuring the turbulent diffusivity via a ti - induced reduction of the electromotive force .",
    "such experiments will be of high relevance as the knowledge of the magnetic turbulent diffusivity is basic for many applications in fluid dynamics . very often we have only limited informations about the magnetic diffusivity . in the laboratory only a very small number of experiments",

    "it is known that the existence of turbulence in the fluid reduces the electric conductivity or  with other words  the fluctuations enhance the magnetic diffusivity called the turbulent magnetic diffusivity . in mhd the turbulent diffusivity is a much more simple quantity than the corresponding eddy viscosity . while the latter is also formed by the existing magnetic fluctuations this is not the case for the turbulent diffusivity . in a simplified ( ` soca ' )",

    "this is indeed the case .",
    "we have shown that ti indeed provides reasonable expressions for the turbulent diffusivity in rotating containers , @xcite .",
    "the absolute values for @xmath68 can only be computed with nonlinear simulations .",
    "the minimum possible magnetic prandtl number for the code yielding robust results is @xmath27 . here",
    "the results without and with rotation but only for @xmath69 are reported .",
    "the used mhd fourier spectral element code has been described earlier in more detail , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "either @xmath70 or @xmath71 fourier modes are used , two or three elements in radius and twelve or eighteen elements in axial direction , resp .",

    "cm we find for sodium ( @xmath84 ) the maximum value of 34 mv as the potential difference from endplate to endplate .",
    "this value can only be considered as an estimate basing on the scaling with @xmath85 suggested by fig .",

    "it is @xmath44 ( quasikeplerian ) and the reynolds number is @xmath89 .",
    "note that the influence of the rotation for the ti - induced emf is surprisingly weak ; with rotation the values are slightly higher than without rotation .",

    "[ fig6 ] a rather weak magnetic prandtl number dependence of @xmath91 is found .",

    "the associated velocity fluctuations for sodium are about 15 m / s in a gap of 1 cm and 1.5 m / s in a gap of 10 cm .",
    "the values are rather similar to those of the riga @xmath94-yashchik experiment , @xcite . even with resting cylinders it is possible to produce rather high ( azimuthal ) velocities in ti experiments .     the same as in fig .",

    "experiments with tayler instability under the presence of differential rotation can also provide eddy viscosity measurements due to the angular momentum transport by both reynolds stress and maxwell stress . within the diffusion approximation it is @xmath95 for the torque in the fluid .",

    "the turbulent magnetic prandtl number @xmath100 becomes about 2.05 .",

    "small @xmath18 are shown to produce large turbulent values @xmath105 .",
