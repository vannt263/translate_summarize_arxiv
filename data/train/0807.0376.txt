    "galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ) is a major expansion of the millennium galaxy catalogue ( mgc ) survey ( liske et al 2003 ; allen et al 2005 ; driver et al 2005 ) and a natural extension of the extremely productive nearby `` legacy '' surveys ( e.g. , sdss , 2mass , hipass etc ) . in comparison to the superb sdss survey gama will only sample 250 sq degrees of sky but will extend to significantly fainter spectroscopic limits ( 12@xmath5 the redshift density of sdss main , 5@xmath5 stripe 82 ) , to higher spatial ( @xmath6 fwhm ) and spectral ( 37 ) resolutions , as well as moving to a far broader wavelength coverage ( uv to radio ) .",
    "gama has come about by parallel technological developments leading to a suite of new facilities whose survey sensitivities , resolutions , and capabilities are reasonably well matched . until now",
    "the study of galaxies has generally been restricted to either large samples of limited wavelength data or multi - wavelength studies of small ( and often biased ) samples .",
    "however galaxy systems are extremely complex and diverse , exhibiting strong environmental and mass dependencies and containing distinct but interlinked components ( agn , nucleus , bulge , pseudo - bulge , bar , disc etc ) and constituents ( smbh , plasma , stars , gas , dust etc ) .",
    "it then follows that a clear understanding of galaxy formation and evolution may only come about via the construction of a comprehensive survey which simultaneously samples all of these facets .",
    "the gama team aims to provide this data .",
    "in addition to the provision of a generic galaxy database , the gama project also includes a number of more focussed science goals , in particular :    \\1 .",
    "measurement of the halo mass function via virialised group velocity dispersions to directly test the _ numerical _ prediction from cdm ( and wdm ) simulations .",
    "measurement of the dynamic , baryonic , hi and stellar mass functions to lmc masses versus redshift , environment , type , and component ( as well as higher order relations , e.g. , mass - spin [ @xmath7 ) .",
    "measurement of the recent merger rates and star formation rates versus type , mass and environment over a 34 gyr baseline .",
    "fig .  1 shows the facilities currently contributing to the gama project along with the approximate time allocations within the gama sky regions ( see fig .  2 and tables  1  &  2 ) .",
    "the expected source resolution and detection sensitivities ( 5@xmath8 point source ) are shown in fig .  3 ( upper and lower ) in arcseconds and millijanskys . overlaid on",
    "the lower panel is the modelled ngc891 spectra ( popescu et al . , 2000 ) with a weak agn added and transposed to @xmath9 .",
    "the ukirt data is provided courtesy of the ukidss las public survey while the vst and vista data are provided via the kids and viking eso public surveys ( whose teams include gama members ) .",
    "the herschel data is provided as part of the broader herschel - atlas survey and a proposal is currently pending to complete galex medium depth observations of the gama regions ( @xmath1050% already covered with mis )",
    ". a major advancement over previous surveys will be the inclusion of radio data via askap ( australian square kilometer array pathfinder , see johnston et al .",
    "2007 ) which should allow hi mass , dynamical mass and continuum measurements for all gama galaxies with high or normal neutral gas content .",
    "the deep askap pointing ( a single @xmath11 field of 1 year integration ) is predicted to have an n(z ) distribution comparable to that derived for gama ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . while the exact location of the askap deep pointing has not been finalised it is highly likely , given the similarity in the n(z )",
    "distributions that one of the gama fields will be adopted ( nominally the 12hr field ) .",
    ".the current extent of the gama survey showing the year 1 regions and two possible expansion options currently under consideration . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the survey commenced march 2008 with 50k spectra obtained in 21 clear nights using the anglo australian observatory s new multi - fibre - fed bench - mounted dual - beam spectroscopic system ( aa@xmath4 ) .",
    "5 shows the areas of sky surveyed ( upper ) and the resulting cone plot ( lower ) .",
    "this includes the existing 25k redshifts within these regions from the mgc , sdss and 2dfgrs .",
    "aa@xmath4 represents an upgrade of the pre - existing 2df system using the same fibre positioner / tumbler but replacing the two telescope mounted spectrographs with a single bench - mounted , double - beam spectrograph ( see sharp et al .",
    "2006 or the aao website ) .",
    "the facility can be used for both multi - fibre and integral field spectroscopy and in multi - fibre mode is capable of obtaining 350400 spectra in a single 2@xmath12 diameter field . during an 8hr observation period",
    "the system is capable of obtaining @xmath103000 spectra .",
    "data are reduced in real - time and redshifts also obtained in real - time via cross - correlation with a template library .",
    "all data are later re - reduced and processed with gandalf ( see schawinski et al 2007 ) to obtain line indices and velocity dispersion measurements .",
    "the gama survey at the aat uses the 580v and 385r gratings yielding a resolution of 1300 or 37fwhm .",
    "the gama project has commenced with data flows imminent from a number of international facilities .",
    "the survey will allow for a comprehensive study of structure on 1kpc to 1mpc scales as well as the subdivision of the galaxy population into its distinct components and constituents .",
    "progress and data releases ( 1st data release forecast for dec 2009 ) can be monitored via the gama website : http://www.eso.org/@xmath10jliske/gama/ and anyone interested in further details should contact simon driver at spd3@st-and.ac.uk .",
    "the gama team acknowledges all staff of the anglo australian observatory for the provision of the superb aa@xmath4 facility and the continued smooth running of the anglo australian telescope .",
    "spd wishes to thank the iau254 organisers for a most enjoyable meeting .",
