    "low energy @xmath3 annihilation into hadrons provides a source of valuable information about the interactions of light quarks .",
    "precise measurements of the exclusive cross sections as well as the total cross section appear important for different applications like , e.g. , determination of various qcd parameters like quark masses , quark and gluon condensates  @xcite , calculations of the hadronic contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment and running fine structure constant  @xcite .    the hypothesis of conserved vector current ( cvc ) and isospin symmetry relate to each other the isovector part of @xmath4 hadrons and corresponding ( vector current induced ) hadronic decays of the @xmath5-lepton  @xcite .",
    "these relations provide a possibility to use an independent high - statistics data sample from @xmath5 decays for increasing the precision of the spectral functions directly measured in @xmath3 annihilation  @xcite .",
    "while this idea appeared fruitful 10 years ago  @xcite , further increase of the experimental statistics in both @xmath3 and @xmath5 sectors revealed unexpected problems : the @xmath6 spectral function determined from @xmath5 decays using cvc was significantly higher than that obtained from @xmath3 , there are indications at a similar deviation in the four - pion channel  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to perform a systematic test of cvc relations using available experimental information on various final states . for the vector part of the weak hadronic current the mass distribution of the produced hadronic system is @xmath7 where a spectral function @xmath8 is given by the expression @xmath9 and @xmath10 is an electroweak correction equal to 1.0194 according to  @xcite .",
    "the allowed quantum numbers for the hadronic decays channels are :    @xmath11    after integration @xmath12 theoretical predictions for the branching ratios of different @xmath5 decay modes based on cvc were earlier given by many authors , see the bibliography in ref .",
    "new comparison of cvc based predictions with experiments on @xmath5 lepton decays was motivated by recent progress of experiments on @xmath5 decays as well as by updated information from @xmath13 annihilation into hadrons , coming mostly from the babar collaboration . in this work we focus on two particular final states  @xmath14 and @xmath15 .    for numerical estimates we will use the value of the electronic branching",
    "@xmath16 17.85 @xmath17 0.05 % and @xmath18=0.9742 recommended by rpp-2008  @xcite .",
    "the reaction @xmath20 was recently studied by the babar collaboration using isr in a broad energy range  @xcite .",
    "earlier measurements were performed at the nd  @xcite , cmd-2  @xcite detectors from 1.25  gev to 1.4  gev and at the dm1  @xcite and dm2  @xcite detectors above this energy .",
    "figure  [ eta ] shows results of various measurements . in general , they are in fair agreement with each other within errors although below 1.4  gev the values of the cross section from babar are somewhat higher than those of previous experiments . above this energy",
    "the results of babar are significantly higher than those of dm2 , whereas they are in good agreement with dm1 .",
    "however , the measurement of the latter has much worse accuracy compared to dm2 .    ]",
    "we calculated the branching fraction of @xmath21 decay expected from the above mentioned @xmath3 data using the relation ( 4 ) .",
    "the direct integration of experimental points in the energy range from 1.25  gev to the @xmath5 mass using older data gives for the branching ratio @xmath22 in agreement with the previous estimate  @xcite while the one based on the babar data gives @xmath23 , where we took into account the 8% systematic uncertainty claimed by the authors  @xcite . averaging and inflating the error by a scale factor of 1.50 , we arrive at the cvc prediction of @xmath24 for the energy range ( 1.25 - 1.77 )  gev .",
    "finally , we add the contribution of the low energy range from 1.0  gev to 1.25  gev ( the babar data set ) to obtain the total cvc expectation of @xmath25 . it can be compared to the results of the measurements which are shown in table  [ tabeta ] and include older results from cleo  @xcite and aleph  @xcite as well as the new result of belle reported at this workshop  @xcite : @xmath26 .",
    "table 2    experimental values of @xmath27    [ tabeta ]    [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    it can be seen that the older predictions based on the @xmath3 data and cvc agree with the much more accurate result of this work , which uses more data , in particular a more precise data sample of babar .",
    "other predictions , which are more theoretically driven and use the low - energy effective lagrangian , show a much larger spread of the results .",
    "recently , the babar collaboration presented the very first measurement of the cross section of the process @xmath29",
    "@xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : etap ] .",
    "the cross section of the process clearly shows resonant behavior with a maximum slightly above 2  gev , but its values at energies below the @xmath5 lepton mass are very small .",
    "we fit the cross section assuming the breit - wigner amplitude for production of three pseudoscalar mesons  @xcite and obtain the following resonance parameters ( mass , width and cross section at the peak ) :    @xmath30    @xmath31    @xmath32    here the systematic error of @xmath33 is 10% following the estimate of the overall systematic error of the cross section in ref .  @xcite . taking into account that we do not estimate systematic uncertainties on mass and width one can conclude that the resonance parameters are compatible with those of the @xmath34  @xcite . using ( 4 ) we integrate the optimal curve for the cross section up to the @xmath5 mass and obtain for the branching ratio : @xmath35 where the first error is statistical ( that of the fit ) ,",
    "the second is experimental systematic and the third is the model one estimated by using the world average values of the @xmath34 mass and width and varying them within errors .",
    "the obtained result is consistent with zero and we place the following upper limit at 90% cl using the method of ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath36 which is two times more restrictive than the upper limit based on the only existing measurement from cleo  @xcite : @xmath37 but still an order of magnitude higher than a theoretical estimate @xmath38 based on the chiral lagrangian  @xcite .    ]",
    "using available data from @xmath3 annihilation and cvc we obtained the following results for the @xmath5 lepton branching fractions :    * for the @xmath39 the expected branching is @xmath25 compatible with the world average of @xmath40 ; * for the @xmath41 the upper limit is @xmath42 or 2.5 times smaller than the experimental upper limit of @xmath43 , both at 90% cl .",
