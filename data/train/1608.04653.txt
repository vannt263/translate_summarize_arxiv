    "holographic methods or gauge / gravity duality have provided novel and effective ways to analyse strongly correlated systems . in particular , there have been much effort and some successes in understanding universal properties of strongly coupled systems .",
    "important examples include the holographic bound of the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density ( @xmath5 ) in strongly correlated plasma , linear @xmath6 resistivity and hall angle of strange metal phase  @xcite .    in this paper , we study another universal property observed in high - temperature superconductors and some conventional superconductors by holographic methods .",
    "it is home s law  @xcite , which connects three quantities in normal phase and condensed phase as follows : @xmath7 where @xmath2 is the superfluid density at zero temperature , @xmath3 is the phase transition temperature , and @xmath4 is the dc conductivity in the normal phase close to @xmath3 .",
    "the point is that @xmath1 is a material independent universal number .",

    "are defined to be dimensionless and the numerical values of @xmath1 are computed in  @xcite based on the experimental data in @xcite .",
    "it was argued that homes law might be related to ` planckian dissipation ' , which is the quantum limit of dissipation with the shortest possible dissipation time @xmath11 in the normal state of high temperature superconductors  @xcite . because the @xmath5 bound of strongly correlated plasma also",
    "can be explained by planckian dissipation  @xcite , homes law may give a good chance to find some universal physics in both condensed matter systems and quark - gluon plasma  @xcite .    even though the holographic models of superconductor have been extensively developed  @xcite since",
    "the pioneering work by hartnoll , herzog , and horowitz in 2008  @xcite , homes law in this context has not been studied much .",
    "it is partly because early holographic superconductor models are translationally invariant with finite charge density . as a result they can not relax momentum and",
    "yield infinite @xmath12 in so @xmath1 is not well defined . to have a finite @xmath4 several methods",
    "were proposed to incorporate momentum relaxation : spatially modulated boundary conditions for bulk fields  @xcite , massive gravity models  @xcite , q - lattice models  @xcite , massless scalar models with shift symmetry  @xcite , and models with a bianchi vii@xmath13 symmetry dual to helical lattices  @xcite .",
    "based on these models , holographic superconductors incorporating momentum relaxation have been developed  @xcite .    among the aforementioned holographic superconductors with momentum relaxation",
    ", homes law has been studied only in two models @xcite . for both cases ,",
    "there are parameters representing the strength of momentum relaxation , which also can be interpreted as parameters specifying material properties .",
    "thus , homes law in holographic models means that @xmath1 is constant independent of momentum relaxation parameters . in @xcite a holographic superconductor model in a helical lattice",
    "was analysed and homes law was satisfied for some restricted parameter regime . here",
    "the amplitude and the pitch of the helix are the momentum relaxation parameters . in @xcite a holographic superconductor model with massless scalar fields",
    "linear in spatial coordinate are studied and homes law was not satisfied .",
    "here the proportionality constant to spatial coordinate is the strength of momentum relaxation .",
    "therefore , it seems that homes law is not realized for all holographic models . because physics behind homes law in @xcite has not been clearly understood yet",
    ", it is important to analyse other holographic models i ) to see how much holographic homes law is robust and ii ) to find the common physical mechanism for homes law in different models . for this purpose , in this paper , we study homes law in a holographic superconductor model with q - lattice  @xcite .",
    "we choose this model for two reasons .",
    "first , our model can be easily compared with two previous works on homes law : i ) the model has a similar structure to the helical lattice model  @xcite in that it has two parameters ( amplitude and wavelength of lattice ) ii ) the model is also similar to the massless scalar model  @xcite in certain limit .",
    "second , it was argued in @xcite that homes law might have something to do with the metal / insulator transition in normal state and it was reported that our model also has the metal - insulator transition  @xcite .",
    "we find that homes law is realized also in our q - lattice model for certain parameter regime , similarly to the helical lattice model in @xcite .",
    "however , in computing the superfluid density , there is an issue that the superfluid density is different from the charge density at zero temperature ( see the end of section [ sec4 ] for more details . ) .",
    "the same issue was also raised in other holographic superconductor models  @xcite . to check",
    "if the superfluid density is identified correctly , we compute superfluid density in two methods : one is related to the infinite dc conductivity and the other is related to the magnetic penetration depth .",
    "both yield the same results with finite momentum relaxation , but the only latter captures the superfluid density in the case without momentum relaxation .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we introduce a holographic superconductor model with q - lattice . the metal - insulator transition in the normal state is also reviewed . in section [ sec3 ] ,",

    "physically , it means that the charged degrees of freedom of the system are conserved .",
    "second , in the limit @xmath97 and @xmath98 , the curl of ( [ lon ] ) gives @xmath110 . with maxwell s equation @xmath111 , we have @xmath112 implying the meissner effect . here",
    "@xmath113 is the magnetic penetration depth squared which is inversely proportional to the superfluid density .",
    "based on these two limits , the superfluid density can be obtained experimentally by measuring optical conductivity or magnetic penetration depth .",

    "the two limits @xmath121 and @xmath122 may not commute . in the probe limit , it was shown that the two limits commute  @xcite , but in the case of full back reaction as in our set - up , these two limits may not commute . because of this potential subtlety we will introduce new notations for superfluid density : @xmath123 for the case 1 ) and @xmath124 for the case 2 ) .    first , to calculate the superfluid density in the limit @xmath95 and @xmath121 , we introduce a small fluctuation of the gauge field of the form @xcite @xmath125 which is coupled to the fluctuations of the metric and the scalar field @xmath20 : @xmath126 the equations of motion for @xmath127 and @xmath128 are shown in appendix [ app1 ] . near boundary the asymptotic behaviour of the fluctuations are as follows : @xmath129 we want to read off the electric conductivity only with electric field turned on , i.e. @xmath130 however , as explained in detail in @xcite if we impose ingoing boundary conditions near horizon it turns out that the number of independent parameters becomes only two , one of which should be @xmath131 .",
    "thus we can not set both @xmath132 and @xmath133 to be zero .",
    "however , if we impose @xmath134 we may turn off the other sources by using diffeomorphism  @xcite . with this condition",
    "we get @xmath135 which is equivalent to because @xmath136 and @xmath137 by the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "+      next we study the limit @xmath97 and @xmath138 . in this case",
    "we introduce a fluctuation in @xmath139 that have momentum dependence of the form @xcite @xmath140 unlike  @xcite , we consider the back - reaction so @xmath141 is coupled to the metric fluctuation : @xmath142 the equations of motions for these two fluctuations are written in appendix [ app1 ] . near boundary @xmath143 and setting @xmath144 we have @xmath145      using and we have computed @xmath123 and @xmath146 as functions of @xmath147 for different sets of parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 . for example , in figure [ ks1 ] , we show our results for four cases : @xmath148 .",

    "( b ) is not ads - rn , since there is a finite scalar field @xmath155 with a boundary value @xmath156 .",
    "however , the boundary theory is still translationally invariant because @xmath50 .",
    "here we find that @xmath157 in general .",
    "we expect the superfluid density vanishes @xmath158 so the superfluid density should be identified with @xmath124 .",
    "the non - zero @xmath123 for @xmath158 may be interpreted as a spurious effect by the infinite dc conductivity due to translational invariance .",
    "this is an interesting and useful observation , since @xmath124 gives a direct way to compute the superfluid density even in the case with translation invariance .",
    "next , let us turn to the case with momentum relaxation in figure [ ks1 ] ( c ) and ( d ) . here @xmath159 and they are zero for @xmath158 , which means that the aforementioned spurious contribution to @xmath123 by translational invariance vanishes .",
    "notice that the superfluid density @xmath124 in figure [ ks1 ] ( d ) is similar to @xmath124 in figure [ ks1 ] ( a ) .",
    "it is because in the limit @xmath160 the translation invariance is effectively restored as explained at the end of section [ sec3 ] . in this",
    "limit the value of @xmath161 becomes irrelevant and the geometry approaches to the ads - rn not the one for figure [ ks1 ] ( b ) .    for our goal ( homes law ) , we need to know @xmath10 at zero @xmath6 .",

    "we have also checked homes law for a different @xmath191 ( @xmath73 ) and obtained qualitatively the same result .",
    "if @xmath192 increases , it is possible that the mit does not occur and consequently homes law does not hold . for example , if @xmath193 our model becomes similar to the massless scalar model and it was shown that there is no mit and no homes law in that model if @xmath20 does not have @xmath25 dependence  @xcite .",
    "homes law in our model comes from the mit and strong momentum relaxation .",
    "the mit seems to be less relevant phenomenologically but strong momentum relaxation is encouraging since it is a property of incoherent metal regime where planckian dissipation may occur  @xcite .",
    "however , it turns out that our model does not have a linear in @xmath6 resistivity in normal ( strange metal ) phase as shown in figure [ mit2 ] .",
    "because the linear in @xmath6 resistivity is a universal property of the normal phase of high @xmath3 superconductors and may be related to the physics of homes law by the planckian dissipation  @xcite , it will be important to study homes law in a holographic model having linear in @xmath6 resistivity such as @xcite @xcite .",

    "<S> we study homes law in holographic superconductor with q - lattices and find that homes law is realized for some parameter regime in insulating phase near the metal - insulator transition boundary , where momentum relaxation is strong . in computing the superfluid density , we employ two methods : one is related to the infinite dc conductivity and the other is related to the magnetic penetration depth . with finite momentum relaxation both yield the same results , while without momentum relaxation only the latter gives the superfluid density correctly because the former has a spurious contribution from the infinite dc conductivity due to translation invariance . </S>"
