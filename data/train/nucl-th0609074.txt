    "the knowledge on weak interaction processes is one of the most important ingredients for resolving astrophysical problems .",
    "the first systematical work on stellar weak - interaction rates was performed by fuller , fowler , and newman @xcite , who recognized the decisive role played by the gamow - teller ( gt ) transitions . due to their pioneering work",
    ", the study of stellar weak interaction rates requested by astrophysics becomes essentially a nuclear structure problem , in which the actual decay rates are determined by the microscopic inside of nuclear many - body systems .",
    "it has been suggested that the nuclear shell model , i.e. a full diagonalization of an effective hamiltonian in a chosen model space , is the most preferable method for gt transition calculations .",
    "this was noticed early by aufderheide _",
    "@xcite , and has recently been emphasized by langanke and martnez - pinedo @xcite .    for a theoretical model employed in gt transition calculations",
    ", it is generally required that the model can reproduce a wide range of structure properties of relevant nuclei .",
    "it has been shown that the state - of - the - art shell - model diagonalization method is indeed capable of performing such calculations .",
    "for example , wildenthal and brown @xcite obtained nuclear wave functions in the full @xmath1-shell model space , which were successfully applied to calculation of gt rates in the @xmath1 shell nuclei @xcite . by using the method developed by the strasbourg - madrid group @xcite , langanke and martnez - pinedo @xcite made the shell - model gt rates available also for the @xmath2 shell nuclei .",
    "still , these sophisticated calculations are tractable only for nuclei up to the mass-60 region , and can not be applied to heavier nuclei which play important roles in the nuclear processes in massive stars .    in the long history of the nuclear shell - model development ,",
    "tremendous effort has been devoted to extending the shell - model capacity from its traditional territory to heavier shells . despite the great progress made in recent years",
    ", it seems impossible to treat an arbitrarily large nuclear system in a spherical shell model framework due to the unavoidable problem of dimension explosion .",
    "one is thus compelled to seek judicious schemes to deal with large nuclear systems .",
    "the central issue has been the shell - model truncation .",
    "there are many different ways of truncating a shell - model space . while in principle",
    ", it does not matter how to prepare a model basis , it is crucial in practice to use the most efficient one . in this regard ,",
    "we recognize the fact that except for a few lying in the vicinity of shell closures , most nuclei in the nuclear chart are deformed .",
    "this naturally suggests for a shell model calculation to use a _ deformed _ basis to incorporate the physics in large systems . that is the philosophy that the projected shell model ( psm ) @xcite and the several important generalizations @xcite are based on .    the present article reports on the new development for calculation of gt transition rates in the psm framework .",
    "before a detailed description of the work , we mention a few attractive features in our approach , which may be relevant for future astrophysical applications .    *",
    "the psm utilizes single particle bases generated by deformed mean - field models yet carries out a shell - model diagonalization like the conventional shell model .",
    "conceptually , the psm bridges two important nuclear structure methods : the deformed mean - field approach and the conventional shell model , and takes the advantages of both . on the one hand , as a shell model , the psm can be applied to any heavy , deformed nuclei without a size limitation . on the other hand , unlike the mean - field models or models with an average nature , the psm wave functions contain correlations beyond mean - field and the states are written in the laboratory frame having definite quantum numbers such as angular - momentum and parity .",
    "these are needed properties when the wave functions are employed in transition calculations .",
    "* because of the way the psm constructs its basis , the dimension of the model space is small ( usually in the range of @xmath3 ) . with this size of basis , a state - by - state evaluation of gt transition rates is computationally feasible .",
    "this feature is important because in stellar environments with finite temperatures , the usual situation is that the thermal population of excited states in a parent nucleus sets up connections to many states in a daughter by the gt operator .",
    "however , our current knowledge on gt transitions from excited nuclear states is very poor , and in many cases , it must rely on theoretical calculations . *",
    "the calculation of forbidden transitions involves nuclear transitions between different harmonic oscillator shells and thus requires multi - shell model spaces",
    ". such a calculation is not feasible for most of the conventional shell models working in one - major shell bases .",
    "the psm is a multi - shell shell model .",
    "this feature is desired particularly when forbidden transitions are dominated .",
    "* isomeric states belong to a special group of nuclear states because of their long half - lives .",
    "the existence of isomeric states in nuclei could alter significantly the elemental abundances produced in nucleosynthesis .",
    "there are cases in which an isomer of sufficiently long lifetime can change the paths of reactions taking place and lead to a different set of elemental abundances @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the psm is indeed capable of describing the detailed structure of isomeric states @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly introduce the psm concept and describe how shell model diagonalization is carried out in the angular - momentum - projected bases .",
    "technical details of calculation of transition matrix elements in the projected bases are given in sec .",
    "our first example of a gt transition calculation is illustrated in sec .",
    "iv , where we first validate the model by comparing the calculated structure properties ( energy levels and electromagnetic transitions ) with experiment .",
    "the obtained gt transition results are then discussed and the effects caused by the gamow - teller residual forces and by configuration mixing are studied . finally , the work is summarized and an outlook on future applications is given in sec .",
    "the projected shell model @xcite works with the following scheme .",
    "it begins with the deformed nilsson single particle basis , with pairing correlations incorporated into the basis by a bcs calculation for the nilsson states .",
    "the nilsson - bcs calculation defines a deformed quasiparticle ( qp ) basis",
    ". then the angular - momentum ( and if necessary , also particle - number , parity ) projection is performed on the qp basis to form a shell model space in the laboratory frame .",
    "finally a two - body hamiltonian is diagonalized in this projected space .",
    "let @xmath4 be the qp vacuum and @xmath5 and @xmath6 the qp creation operators , with the index @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) denoting the neutron ( proton ) quantum numbers and running over selected single - qp states for each configuration .",
    "the multi - qp configurations of the psm are given for the four kinds of nuclei as follows :    @xmath9    note that the psm works with multiple harmonic - oscillator shells for both neutrons and protons .",
    "the indices @xmath7 and @xmath8 in ( [ qpset ] ) are general ; for example , a 2-qp state can be of positive parity if both quasiparticles @xmath10 and @xmath11 are from the major @xmath12-shells that differ in @xmath12 by @xmath13 , or of negative parity if @xmath10 and @xmath11 are from those @xmath12-shells that differ by @xmath14 . in bases ( [ qpset ] ) , ",
    "@xmath15 \" denotes those configurations having a higher order of quasiparticles , which may practically be ignored in the present study . on the other hand , the bases ( [ qpset ] )",
    "can be easily enlarged if necessary . if the configurations denoted by",
    " @xmath15 \" are completely included , one recovers the full shell model space written in the representation of qp excitation .",
    "the shell model basis states can then be constructed by the projection technique . without losing generality ,",
    "the psm wave - function can be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the qp - basis given in ( 1 ) , and @xmath18 is the angular momentum projection operator @xcite . in eq.([pn ] ) , @xmath19 is the @xmath20-function @xcite , @xmath21 the rotation operator , and @xmath22 the solid angle .",
    "if one keeps the axial symmetry in the deformed basis , @xmath19 in eq.([pn ] ) reduces to the small @xmath23-function and the three dimensions in @xmath22 reduce to one .",
    "the energies and wave functions ( given in terms of the coefficients @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ wf ] ) ) are obtained by solving the following eigen - value equation : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are respectively the matrix elements of the hamiltonian and the norm @xmath28    the psm uses a large single - particle space , which ensures that the collective motion and the cross - shell interplay are defined microscopically by accommodating a sufficiently large number of active nucleons .",
    "it usually includes three ( four ) major harmonic - oscillator shells each for neutrons and protons in a calculation for deformed ( superdeformed or superheavy ) nuclei .",
    "however , the shell model dimension in eq .",
    "( [ wf ] ) is small .",
    "this means that each of the configurations in ( [ wf ] ) is a complex combination of spherical shell model basis states .",
    "although the dimension where the final diagonalization is carried out is small , it is huge in terms of original shell model configurations . in this sense , the psm is truly a shell model in a truncated multi - major - shell space .",
    "the hamiltonian in the present study consists of the separable forces @xmath29 which represent different kinds of characteristic correlations between valence particles .",
    "it has the single - particle term @xmath30 , the quadrupole+pairing force @xmath31 with inclusion of the quadrupole - pairing term , and the gamow - teller force of the charge - exchange terms @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 contains a set of properly adjusted single - particle energies in the nilsson scheme @xcite .",
    "the second force , @xmath31 , contains three terms @xcite @xmath34 which are quadrupole - quadrupole , monopole - pairing , and quadrupole - pairing interactions , respectively .",
    "the strength of the quadrupole - quadrupole force @xmath35 is determined in a self - consistent manner that it would give the empirical deformation as predicted in mean - field calculations @xcite .",
    "the monopole - pairing strength is taken to be the form @xmath36 where ",
    "+ \" (  @xmath37 \" ) is for protons ( neutrons ) , @xmath12 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are respectively the neutron number , proton number , and mass number , and @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the coupling constants adjusted to yield the known odd - even mass differences .",
    "the quadrupole - pairing strength @xmath42 is taken to be about 20@xmath43 of @xmath44 , as is often assumed in the psm calculations @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in many previous publications that such a set of interaction can reasonably well describe structures in heavy nuclei .",
    "the one - body operators ( for each kind of nucleons ) in eq.([qp ] ) are of the standard form @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the nucleon creation operator , with @xmath47 standing for the quantum numbers of a single - particle state in the spherical basis ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the time reversal of @xmath49 is defined as @xmath50 .",
    "the last force , @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ hamilt ] ) , is the gamow - teller force @xmath51 this is a charge - dependent separable interaction with both particle - hole ( ph ) and particle - particle ( pp ) channels , which act between protons and neutrons .",
    "this type of force has been used by several authors @xcite in the study of single- and double-@xmath0 decay .",
    "the ph and pp interactions are defined to be repulsive and attractive , respectively , when the strength parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 take positive values .",
    "the pp interaction , which was introduced by kuzmin and soloviev @xcite , is a neutron - proton pairing force in the @xmath54 channel . in the present calculation , we adopt the interaction strengths @xmath55 from the original work of kuzmin and soloviev @xcite .",
    "we notice that there are different versions for these parameters , for example , the one extracted from systematical studies by homma _",
    "the one - body operators appearing in eq .",
    "( [ gt ] ) are defined as @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the pauli spin operator and the isospin operator , respectively .",
    "as one will see later in an example of the @xmath59ho @xmath60 @xmath59dy transition , the gamow - teller force is important for a correct reproduction of the gt strengths .",
    "we finally mention that the hamiltonian assumed in the form of eq .",
    "( [ hamilt ] ) may need to be extended when specific quantities or transition processes are studied . for example , the spin - dipole force would be necessary to reproduce first - forbidden transitions .",
    "the probability of gamow - teller transition from an initial state of spin @xmath61 to a final state @xmath62 is defined as @xmath63 where the operators @xmath64 are those given in eq .",
    "( [ bgoperator ] ) .",
    "a gt transition involves a transfer of one unit of angular momentum , which is described by the pauli spin operators @xmath65 . the isospin operators @xmath66 transform a neutron into a proton , and _",
    "vice versa_.",
    "the heart of the present development is the evaluation of transition matrix element in the angular - momentum - projected bases .",
    "let us start with the psm wave function in eq .",
    "( [ wf ] ) @xmath67 in a general weak interaction process with isospin exchange , the initial and final states must correspond to different nuclear systems .",
    "therefore , two different sets of quasiparticle are generally involved .",
    "for example , in a calculation of @xmath0-decay from an odd - odd parent to an even - even daughter nucleus , @xmath68 for the initial odd - odd system has the form    @xmath69    and for the final even - even system , @xmath70 here , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are two different sets of quasiparticle operators associated with the quasiparticle vacua @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively .    to compute the matrix element of a tensor operator of rank @xmath75 in the projected states , the matrix element of the operator @xmath76 has to be evaluated .",
    "a useful expression was derived in ref .",

    "moreover , effect of configuration mixing shows up when the gt forces are included ; there is a clear difference between the results of case 3 ( with no 4-qp state in the even - even wave function ) and case 4 ( with 321 4-qp basis states mixed in the even - even wave function ) .",
    "the latter case reproduces data well . comparing the result of case 5 with case 4 ,",
    "one sees a converging trend in the calculation ; further enlarging the configuration space would no longer improve the result as far as the gt transition between the ground states is concerned .",

    "@xcite.,width=226 ]    in stellar environments , nuclei that are exposed to high temperatures and high densities may experience a significant enhancement in their decay rate .",
    "this idea was brought out early by cameron @xcite and studied in detail by bahcall @xcite .",
    "the enhancement can result from the effects related to the thermal population of excited nuclear states in the hot photon bath . in a thermal equilibrium with temperature @xmath162",
    ", the population probability is determined by the boltzmann factor and the statistical weight @xmath163 hence the actual stellar decay rate must consider decays of all thermally populated excited states @xmath10 in the parent nucleus to the accessible levels @xmath11 of the daughter .",
    "thermal enhancement of beta - decay rates can have substantial impact on nucleosynthesis , for example , the s - process branching conditions @xcite .",
    "in this article , we have presented the new development of a shell model method for calculation of gamow - teller transition rates .",
    "the method is based on the projected shell model .",
    "different from the conventional shell model , which builds its states in a spherical basis , the psm constructs its states in a deformed basis in which important nuclear correlations are taken into account very efficiently .",
    "therefore , it is possible for a shell model diagonalization in the psm to be carried out in a manageable space for medium to heavy , and even for super - heavy nuclei .    we have shown how the gt transition matrix elements are calculated in the psm framework .",
    "a computer code has been developed and been tested .",
    "one nontrivial test has been done through the ikeda sum - rule .",
    "we have obtained a reasonable distribution of the b(gt ) strength with a fulfillment of the sum - rule .",
    "we have presented the first example from the rare earth region . in the calculation of @xmath59ho @xmath60 @xmath59dy electron - capture process , we have predicted the gt transition rates for the excited states .",
    "such rates should be included as part of the total rate when these states are thermally populated in hot stellar environments .    in the calculation",
    "discussed so far , we have considered only allowed @xmath0-decay for the low - lying states",
    ". calculation of allowed @xmath0-decay for states with high excitation and the forbidden transitions is possible in the psm framework .",
    "study of gt giant resonance is also under consideration .",
    "the method described in the present article can be applied to various fields such as nuclear astrophysics and fundamental physics , where weak interaction processes take place in nuclear systems @xcite . in particular , one may find interesting applications to cases where a laboratory measurement for certain weak interaction rates is difficult and where the conventional shell model calculations are not feasible .",
    "potential applications in nuclear astrophysics are calculations of @xmath0-decay rates for the r - process @xcite and the rp - process @xcite nucleosynthesis , and electron - capture rates for the core collapse supernova modelling @xcite . in the double-@xmath0 decay theory ,",
    "theoretical calculations for the nuclear matrix elements are needed , for which one has relied on the quasiparticle random phase approximation @xcite , particularly when heavy nuclei are involved .",
