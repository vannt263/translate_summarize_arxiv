    "among the diversity of forms that intergalactic structures can adopt , giant gaseous tails and streams accompanying galaxy interactions constitute one of the most impressive phenomena . widespread , dense and wide , they are able to transport matter tens of kiloparsecs away from the parent objects .",
    "these tails are sometimes accompanied by streams of stars , either formed in the tail , or inherited from progenitor galaxies .",
    "systems that contain such tails are usually referred to as the `` gas streamers '' .",
    "notable examples include the leo triplet , where the tail extends by more than 140kpc from ngc3628 @xcite , or arp143 , where close encounter of the pair members results in mass loss experienced by one of the galaxies , while the tail traces its trajectory around the companion @xcite .",
    "+ an open question concerning these intergalactic structures is the existence and importance of magnetic fields inside them .",
    "the belief that magnetic fields can be associated with such tails is plausible because of the ambipolar diffusion . in this process",
    ", neutral particles are transferred together with conducting plasma , to which they are collisionally coupled to ( see eg .",
    "@xcite , or @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , it might be expected that the neutral gas tail can be accompanied by a magnetised outflow .",
    "ability to transport gas far away from the intra - system medium gives a possibility that also the magnetic field ",
    "frozen into the gas  can be supplied to large volumes of intergalactic space .",
    "several examples of such objects are known ( eg . the antennae , @xcite ) ; this raises an interesting question , whether these outflows and tidal tails can play a crucial role in the magnetisation of cosmic space  as it was suggested by @xcite .",
    "also , the dynamical importance of the magnetic field in the evolution of such structures is yet unknown , while it is known to be one of the major participants in dynamics and evolution of galaxies itselves @xcite . outside the galaxies ,",
    "both thermal gas and gravitational energy densities are lower than in the galactic disks , and therefore the fraction of the total energy attributed to the magnetic field is higher , than inside them .",
    "+ study of the intergalactic structures yields a possibility to learn more about the magnetic field itself . unfortunately , though several neutral gas structures with magnetic field were found between the galaxies ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) , there is no definite observational evidence for magnetisation of the giant outflows and tails .",
    "+ nearby galaxy pair ngc4490/85 , the so - called `` cocoon galaxy '' is one of the bright , nearby objects from the shapley - ames catalogue @xcite .",
    "the intergalactic space between the member galaxies is filled with numerous areas of star formation .",
    "this is a clear sign of an ongoing interaction between the pair members .",
    "ngc4490 is a very special case of an interacting system . despite the small distance between member galaxies of the pair and the `` cocoon '' outlook ,",
    "tidal forces have not yet disrupted its disk , as the interaction is just starting .",
    "the aforementioned stream of intergalactic star - forming regions between the galaxies , accompanied by a bridge of radio emission is the single hint of this process .",
    "two other phenomena that are usually explained on the basis of tidal interactions ",
    "giant neutral gas tails , and generally rapid star formation  are not triggered by the merging process .",
    "@xcite suggested that ngc4490 is a very young galaxy that rapidly forms stars at a constant rate and the giant tails result from the wind caused by frequent supernovae explosions .",
    "+ given the high efficiency of the star formation in this system one can conclude that strong magnetic fields should be present inside and outside of the galaxies .",
    "arp269 is also interesting as it provides an unique possibility to study the issue of gas magnetisation in the eve of the interaction process . and",
    "as this galaxy pair is a dwarfish system , the merging process might be similar to that which gave rise to the current large galaxies  agglutination of the smaller objects .",
    "particularly interesting is the chance to survey the hi envelope for any traces of radio continuum emission .",
    "+ a detailed study of the radio emission of this galaxy pair has been made by @xcite .",
    "these authors have presented interferometric maps of the emission at various radio frequencies .",
    "high resolution of their images ",
    "12 arcseconds  provided a detailed insight into the morphology of the radio emission .",
    "however , achieving such a small beam requires usage of a loose configuration of the interferometer .",
    "this leads to an incomplete sampling of the innermost part of the ( u , v ) plane , hence , loss of the extended emission .",
    "this effect turns out to be important in studies of ngc4490/85 made by @xcite , who state substantial flux density loss of 40% at 8.46ghz .",
    "this precluded any search for diffuse intergalactic structures .",
    "+ an useful solution that allows to regain the missing flux density information whilst retaining high resolution can be obtained by merging the interferometric and single dish data .",
    "the resultant image has high both resolution and sensitivity to the extended structures . in a propitious situation , nearly whole missing flux density and all structures",
    "can be successfully restored ( see eg .",
    "+ high frequency interferometric observations of intergalactic , diffuse emission suffer also from a limited primary beam size . moreover , without the continuous supply of relativistic particles , the radio spectrum of intergalactic structures quickly steepens making the intergalactic emission undetectable at high frequencies . for this reason we performed sensitive , low - frequency observations using the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) at 0.61ghz .",
    "this enabled us to search for the radio emission produced by the low energy electrons that have longer lifetimes , and their emission can be traced at larger distances from their supply sources in galactic disks . as there were no previous detailed studies of this galaxy that made use of the under - gigahertz frequencies , our observations enable more accurate estimations of the spectral parameters , like the break frequency , or synchrotron age . additionally , the large primary beam of gmrt permits to study structures of larger angular scales than those observable at several ghz . + in our paper we present a new map at 0.61 ghz from our own gmrt observations together with the vla maps at previously studied frequencies , merged with our effelsberg data .",
    "this data are used to probe the magnetic field in various regions within and outside the member galaxies , allowing to study the radio emission of a very young galaxy in the beginning of the merging process with unprecedented fidelity and in a broad frequency range .",
    "the lowest frequency used in our study is 0.61ghz .",
    "these data have been obtained using the gmrt interferometer .",
    "observations were carried out in february , 2013 .",
    "the total bandwidth was 32mhz ( divided into 256channels ) and the total time - on - source ( tos ) was 5.5h ( integration time of 16s ) .",
    "calibration , flagging and further reduction of these data was carried out using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "we used 3c286 to calibrate amplitudes ( and bandpass ) , and the angularly close source 1227 + 365 to calibrate phases .",
    "a set of 49 sub - images ( u , v)-tapered to obtain a circular beam has been made , and all of them have been processed by a self - calibration pipeline to correct the phase information . the final map has been made by the means of tessellation of the sub - images .",
    "primary beam correction has also been applied .",
    "[ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > , < \" , ]     [ params ]      successful separation of the thermal and non - thermal emission opens a possibility to calculate the so - called spectral age , defined as the amount of time elapsed since the last acceleration of the electrons that are responsible for the observed radiation .",
    "however , as various physical processes are characterised by different time - scales of the electron spectrum decay , one can choose from several models of the electron losses .",
    "we decided to follow the procedure used by us in a previous paper @xcite .",
    "hence , estimations of the break frequency were done using the synage package @xcite , which allows to test jaffe ",
    "perola ( @xcite , jp ) , kardashev  pacholczyk ( @xcite ;  @xcite , kp ) , or continuous injection ( @xcite ;  @xcite ;  @xcite , ci ) models of electron energy losses .",
    "synage uses the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) to determine following parameters : spectral index of the injected electron population @xmath1 and the frequency above which the observed spectrum steepens from the initial one  the spectral break frequency @xmath2 ( expressed in ghz ) . + a common assumption for all these three models is that the magnetic field stays constant in time .",
    "the first two models present a similar approach to the problem , differing in the matter of the evolution of the pitch angles of charged particles gyrating in the magnetic field .",
    "jp assumes its isotropisation ( time - scale of this process is significantly lower than the radiative lifetime ) , whereas kp postulates its conservation .",
    "the third one ( ci ) is significantly different , as it includes the continuous injection of a power - law distributions of relativistic electrons .",
    "the resulting electron spectrum is then a combination of emission from various synchrotron populations .",
    "final calculation of the spectral age implies knowledge of the magnetic field strength . in the previous studies ,",
    "constant value of the magnetic field throughout the pair area was assumed . to improve the age estimates , we used the values calculated in sect .",

    "[ fitimages ] shows the results of spectral fitting ( dependence of the non - thermal flux density density on the frequency , both expressed in the logarithmic scale ) .",

    ", we decided to use the jp and ci ( which is basically a series of jp - based events ) models , which have been originally designed to operate on rather compact sources of electron acceleration .",
    "a question then arises , if they are applicable to a normal , non - agn galaxy .",
    "different reasons can be provided for different entities described here . for the star - forming regions ,",
    "the analogy is quite straight - forward and usage of the jp and ci models comes without serious objections .",
    "in fact , it is a rather common assumption , and as @xcite argues , for regions of rapid star formation , the effect of diffusion is not essential . for a galaxy treated as a whole ,",
    "the results from the aforementioned models become more tentative , as here diffusion  especially at the outskirts of the disk  becomes a significant ( or the single one ) source of the crs .",
    "however , jp and ci models can still be useful for starburst galaxies and are still being used ( eg . by @xcite ) .",
    "ngc4490 is a textbook example of a starburst galaxy , and the star formation rate is moreover constant throughout the disk @xcite , justifying usage of both jp and ci .",
    "the last studied structure , the intergalactic bridge seems a rather exotic target for these two models .",
    "but yet , the electron population of this structure was in fact accelerated in a disk region of star formation , for which both models have proven to be applicable .",
    "the observed spectrum can be treated as a one of a compact region of effective electron supply , for which the acceleration has ceased at a given time . +",
    "another issue is the zero spacing problem of the purely interefeormetric data . for compact and strong structures like the star - forming regions , or the galactic centre ,",
    "it is not important .",
    "owing to the rather constant star formation throughout the disk , its emission should not be heavily affected . however , reliability of the spectral fits might be lower for the intergalactic bridge .",
    "the final remark should address the common assumption for both models that the magnetic field remains constant in time , which is not true for the studied entities .",
    "however , the calculated values come with some uncertainty ( of a few @xmath0 g ) , which , in the first approximation , can be treated as a term that _ expresses _ the influence of the magnetic field evolution .",
    "this is especially true for the young , star - forming regions .",
    "results for the disk should be treated with respect to the limitation described above , whereas as the intergalactic bridge is a structure where the magnetic field is no longer amplified , over the course of time calculated from the modelling ( and strength estimation uncertainties ) its magnetic field can be regarded as moreover constant . in some of the cases ,",
    "the fitted spectra were nearly straight lines and the break frequency ( crucial for the age estimate ) was very weakly localised .",
    "a straight - line spectrum signifies a young source , and so are the star - forming regions .",
    "thus , in such cases we decided to present only an upper estimate of the spectral age .      among the most distinctive features of the ngc4490/85 system are the giant neutral hydrogen tails that extend north and south from ngc4490 .",
    "the unusual hi morphology of this pair was first reported by @xcite , who used the jodrell bank mark ii telescope to create square grids of pointings for a selected list of nearby galaxies .",
    "for ngc4490 , they noticed that the gaseous halo is much larger in diameter than the optical counterpart .",
    "the first maps , made by @xcite , revealed the morphology of the emission .",
    "arp269 is a `` gas streamer '' , a system in which the neutral gas is not confined between members ( like it happens for eg .",
    "hcg95 , @xcite , or ngc691 , @xcite ) , but extends beyond them .",
    "a good example is the leo triplet , @xcite , or arp143",
    " @xcite ) . as the magnetic field",
    "is frozen into the gas , an issue if these intergalactic structures can transport magnetised matter outside the galaxy systems is still open , as the radio data on groups are scarce .",
    "such a hypothesis is a plausible one , as ambipolar diffusion could cause such behaviour .",
    "if common , this mechanism can lead to the magnetisation of large volumes of intergalactic space  a process that likely takes place in the case of arp244 ( the antennae galaxies , @xcite ) .",
    "+ in both of the aforementioned streamers , not even single spot of radio emission does coincide with the neutral hydrogen filaments @xcite .",
    "compared to them , ngc4490 looks promising , as  so it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ hifig ]  both northern and southern extensions of the radio continuum envelope are embraced by the hydrogen one . however , the angle between the galactic disk and the magnetised outflow is different than the one between the disk and neutral gas tails ; whereas the gaseous tails are oriented in the nw ",
    "se direction , the radio structures are oriented the other way round : ne  sw . as the continuum extensions do not exceed the innermost part of the hi halo , it is impossible to judge if the magnetic field is being pulled through these tails , or in another direction . despite the question of the coincidence",
    "being left open , the morphology still suggests that a bubble of dense , magnetised matter does extend from the disk and might eventually be transported further as the matter propagates . as for the neutral component",
    ", it might be driven by the wind caused by supernovae having their progenitors in the still - active star forming regions of the galactic disk @xcite , but not necessarily this is true for the magnetised matter .",
    "a study of the polarised emission could be useful in studying this  yet unexplained  phenomenon .",
    "attempts to connect the continuum extension with the h@xmath6 outflow detected by @xcite were also unsuccessful , as the radio extension reaches much further into the intergalactic space .",
    "+ such a doubt does not apply to the bridge that connects the pair members ; in this case the intergalactic radio emission is accompanied by a stream of stars , and a maximum in the neutral gas emission .",
    "this clearly suggests the interaction - based origin of this structure .",
    "the whole envelope of the radio emission is described well by both jp and ci models . only small deviations from the model curve",
    "can be seen ( fig .",
    "[ fitimages ] ) .",
    "the biggest outlier is the one that represents the 4.86ghz flux density .",
    "this is because of the aforementioned extent of the radio envelope at this frequency .",
    "the injection spectral indices of 0.52 and 0.60 for jp and ci models , respectively are somewhat flatter than the non - thermal spectral index value calculated by @xcite , 0.76@xmath70.03 ; however , this is not unusual , as the injection index refers to the value calculated at the lowermost edge of the sed , while the value given by @xcite refers to the higher frequencies .",
    "as a non - thermal spectrum steepens with the increasing frequency due to the electron losses , these values can be considered to be in an agreement .",
    "age estimates for the disk follow the general tendency for the ci model to return higher values .",
    "the jp model estimates the spectral age to be between 2.4 and 5.7myrs , while ci returns 3.8 and 14.9myrs , respectively .",
    "this suggests a rather young population of the electrons , which was still supplied in the nearest past of this galaxy . + as a supplement , we also performed fitting for the `` smooth disk ''  the flux density from the galaxy pair with all the individual regions of enhanced radio emission ( hence , vigorous star formation ) subtracted .",
    "these estimates are in general very similar to the ones derived for the galaxies as whole . from the flux density densities",
    "one can easily see that the diffuse emission is dominating .",
    "the age estimates for the smooth disk are in general slightly lower , but these differences are very small compared to the range between minimal and maximal age . + the total magnetic field strength is @xmath8@xmath0 g .",
    "this suggests strong magnetic field in the whole system ( similar values have been obtained for the smooth disk case ) , higher than the typical one found in spiral galaxies ( 9@xmath7 1.3@xmath0 g , @xcite ) , and similar to that found in m51 @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable , as ngc4490 is a rather small galaxy , compared to the latter one , and smaller systems are usually less efficient in magnetic field amplification @xcite .",
    "the star formation rate ( sfr ) , which is closely related to the magnetic field strengths , is very similar in ngc4490 and m51 : @xcite estimates the sfr of ngc4490 to be about 4.7m@xmath9yr@xmath10 ( basing on the radio data ) , whereas @xcite suggests 4.3m@xmath9yr@xmath10 for m51 ( basing on the ultraviolet data , 50100myr old stellar populations ) . as ngc4490 is much smaller than the latter galaxy , the surface star formation rate is higher , providing a sensible explanation for the estimated magnetic field strength .",
    "ngc4490 and 4485 are connected by a narrow radio bridge , that coincides with a stream of stars . surprisingly , there is not much thermal flux density there , suggesting deficiency of star forming regions .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the shape of the spectrum : it falls rather quickly and weakens abruptly already at 4.86mhz ( where flux density decrement can not be administered to the zero spacing problem ) .",
    "the injection spectral indices reveal flat initial spectrum , suggesting that the observed radio emission originated in regions of effective supply of charged particles .",
    "the ci spectral age estimate for the intergalactic bridge ( 4.5  16.9myrs ) is almost the same as for the galactic disk , whereas the jp estimates ( 3.7  7.9myrs ) are the highest ( among the other ones derived with the jp model ) for the structures in this system . for this region , the jp model provides a better fit to the data .",
    "the magnetic field of the bridge is strong , only slightly weaker than that found inside the galaxy .",
    "the density of the energy contained within is approximately 1.39 @xmath7 0.28 @xmath11 , of the same order as that between the taffy galaxies @xcite .",
    "given the above information , a possible conclusion is that the radio emission in the bridge is a product of magnetic field amplification inside one of the galaxies , and the emitting matter has been torn from it during the interaction process ( or due to the wind of star formation ) .",
    "as there are no effective sources of accelerated particles ( judging on the steepening of the spectrum ) , the spectral age refers to the last acceleration event in the galactic disk , and thus it can be considered the starting point of the merging process . as the extent of the bridge is equal to few kiloparsecs , it would imply that the charged particles travel with velocities of several kilometres per second , which is not an exotic value .",
    "the data points for the galaxy center show some scatter ( fig .",
    "[ fitimages ] ) , but the models fit well . estimated injection spectral index is flat ( 0.45 and 0.46 for jp and ci , respectively ) , close to the theoretical minimum for the young supernovae remnants ( 0.3  @xcite ) .",
    "the fitted models show a very weak curvature , and therefore estimation of the break frequency is complicated .",
    "derived values come with a large uncertainty , and the upper boundary ( which corresponds to the upper age limit of 1.4myrs for jp and 2.8myrs for ci models ) suggests extremely young electron population .",
    "this indicates ongoing star formation and electron supply .",
    "the magnetic field is strong ( 39.3 @xmath7 5.4@xmath0 g ) , but not unusual for a central region of a nearby galaxy .",
    "@xcite state that centers of barred spirals are regions of intense star formation and strong magnetic fields can be found there ; notable examples include ngc1097 with app .",
    "55@xmath0 g , or ngc1365 with a maximum of 63@xmath0 g @xcite .",
    "the northern spiral arm can be easily distinguished from the galactic disk because of the three local emission maxima .",
    "they show high fraction of thermal emission , which becomes dominant at frequencies higher than 4.86ghz . the remaining non - thermal electron population is older than that of the central region . here both lower and upper limits for the spectral age can be derived .",
    "the several myr wide range of possible values suggests moderately aged population of electrons .",
    "the magnetic field is strong ( 25.5@xmath73.5@xmath0 g ) , higher than in typical spiral galaxies , yet still comparable to the arm regions of m51 .",
    "this region lies in the western part of the disk of ngc4490 . compared to the arm regions",
    ", it hosts very similar magnetic field with b@xmath12 = 26.0@xmath73.5@xmath0 g , but as the model curve ( fig .",
    "[ fitimages ] ) is very weakly bent , break frequency is poorly determined and again , only the upper age limit can be derived .",
    "values of 2.0myrs ( jp ) and 3.7myrs ( ci ) are reasonable for an area of intensive , ongoing star formation .",
    "the westernmost star forming region of the disk seems not to differ much from the other areas of enhanced star formation .",
    "it hosts strong magnetic field ( 18.2@xmath72.3@xmath0 g ) , albeit somewhat weaker than in the neighbouring w - disk region . for this sed ( fig .  [ fitimages ] ) , the break frequency can not be estimated more accurately than for w - disk , so only upper limit of the spectral age can be estimated .",
    "both models yield spectral ages of no more than several myrs , once again reasonable for this kind of source .",
    "this unresolved source lies on the easternmost edge of the galactic disk of ngc4490 .",
    "it shows barely any thermal emission , suggesting that it is a background radio galaxy , not related to the foreground galactic system .",
    "constant slope of the sed ( fig .",
    "[ fitimages ] ) causes poor localisation of the break frequency , but it is clearly visible that this source is a subject to a continuous electron supply , resulting in a low spectral age .      south from the centre of ngc4490 , a point - like source , easily distinguishable from the surrounding emission ( see fig .  [ spixgc ] ) can be seen .",
    "this source exhibits an extremely flat spectrum , with an average band - to - band ( total ) spectral index value of 0.13 .",
    "such a value clearly indicates an almost purely thermal character of the emission , as it agrees with the theoretical value of 0.1 @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is not astounding in the light of its identification as an hii region @xcite .",
    "radio emission from such a structure should be dominated by the thermal radiation with the synchrotron component almost negligible .",
    "however , the thermal fraction derived from our lvl maps is much lower than expected , as it does not exceed 40 per cent at any frequency ; a value closer to 100 per cent would be expected .",
    "this is most likely due to the high internal extinction in this dense area .",
    "high extinction of the thermal flux density has also been noticed by @xcite , who suggested a possibility that the obscuring dust is related not to the region itself , but to the surrounding atomic gas .      the companion galaxy ngc4485 is a rather radio quiet one , compared to its neighbour .",
    "most of its emission is due to a group of three sources , compact in character .",
    "this group lies in the southern outskirts of the galactic disk , and @xcite identifies it with a bow - shock in the igm .",
    "emission from these sources has a significant thermal component ( reaching 50% at 15.21ghz ) .",
    "values for the remaining , non - thermal flux density lie on a more or less straight line , suggesting low spectral age . as in some of the previous cases , only upper limit for the spectral age can be derived : 7.8myrs for the jp model and 23.5myrs for the ci .",
    "these limits are higher than those obtained for the disk regions ; whereas this might indicate the older age of the structure formed by the shock , straight - line character of the sed suggests that this region is still a very young one .",
    "the magnetic field is somewhat weaker than that found in the intergalactic bridge .",
