    "over the past few years it became increasingly clear that anomalous normal and superconducting state properties of high-@xmath0 cuprates are governed by their close proximity to the transition into antiferromagnetic mott - hubbard insulator state .",
    "the transition do occurs for strongly underdoped systems .",
    "there are many indications that even overdoped cuprates are never far from being antiferromagnetic @xcite . such kinds of incipient antiferromagnet at low temperatures have both fermionic and spin excitations that strongly interact . for description of such interaction",
    "the two - dimensional spin - fermion models are used .",
    "they have a general form @xmath1 here the kinetic energy term @xmath2 describes the bare fermion propagation .",
    "we take for definiteness the simplest version of nearest neighbor hopping @xmath3 .",
    "the spin subsystem may be described by microscopic heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath4 or quite generally by a phenomenological form of dynamic susceptibility@xcite @xmath5 , as far as we are interested by only fermion spectrum . in the present work",
    "we suppose that spin subsystem is in the paramagnetic state @xmath6 with strong antiferromagnetic correlations @xmath7 , the correlation function @xmath8 is strongly peaked at wave vectors in the vicinity of @xmath9 .",
    "the third term in its simplest form describes kondo interaction @xmath10    in the above formulae the sums run over the sites @xmath11 of a square lattice and over the nearest neighbours with the lattice spacing @xmath12 . for short",
    "we miss the spin index for creation @xmath13 and annihilation @xmath14 operators of the fermi particles ( we shall name them as electrons ) and in the hamiltonian of kondo - interaction @xmath15 we take the notation @xmath16 ; summation over repeated indexes is understood everywhere ; @xmath17 are the pauli matrices .",
    "@xmath18 means thermodynamic average over grand canonical ensemble .    in order to achieve the more realistic description ,",
    "the interaction term may be generalized by addition of nearest neighbour coupling @xmath19 , etc .",
    "it is essential that in any case @xmath20 remains local in real space and does not couple directly the excitations on sites separated by large distance .    the usual approaches to the hamiltonian ( [ s - f ] )",
    "exploit its apparent similarity to that of polaron problem .",
    "various perturbative methods have the advantage of exact treatment of the one - particle part , @xmath21 .",
    "it is widely believed that non - crossing approximation @xcite is appropriate for spin - fermion systems even in strong - coupling regime @xmath22 .",
    "below we shall prove that in this regime the non - crossing approximation violates the sum rule for the third moment of spectral density , as a result , it gives the wrong position of lowest singlet band .",
    "an alternative is the mori - zwanzig projection technique @xcite ; due to the local nature of @xmath23 it suffices small number of basic operators for appropriate account of local correlations .",
    "the obvious disadvantage of the technique is that the kinetic energy is treated in approximate way , as a consequence , it fails to correctly reproduce the weak - coupling regime @xmath24 . in the present paper we exactly take into account the kinetic energy term and use the projection method for remaining terms . in the end",
    "we obtain the fermion self - energy that correctly behaves in the weak - coupling limit and gives the right lowest band position in strong coupling limit .",
    "the quantities we calculate are the retarded fermion green s function ( gf ) @xmath25 and the spectral density @xmath26 .\\ ] ] here and below @xmath27 $ ] stand for anticommutator and commutator respectively . for diagonal gf @xmath28 ,",
    "the spectral density is positively definite @xmath29 .",
    "mori - zwanzig projection method allows to represent @xmath30 in the continued fraction form @xcite : @xmath31    where @xmath32    the coefficients @xmath33 are related with the spectral density @xmath34 via the set of orthogonal polynomials @xmath35 , satisfying the recurrence @xcite : @xmath36    @xmath37    and @xmath38 @xmath39    here we have used the nonnormalized form of the polynomials @xmath40 .",
    "on the other hand , from the equation of motion @xmath41\\ ] ] follows the sum rule @xmath42 for arbitrary function @xmath43 .",
    "in particular , it establishes the relations of coefficients @xmath44 with static correlation functions @xmath45 @xmath46    now introducing the self energy @xmath47 through the relation @xmath48 and comparing ( [ cf ] ) and ( [ gfsigm ] ) we see that @xmath47 it is the continued fraction similar to @xmath49 .",
    "thus we can introduce the spectral density    @xmath50/\\pi\\ ] ] and obtain for it sum rules that follow from ( [ srule ] ) @xmath51 @xmath52 as it follows from ( [ b1a1 ] ) and ( [ pola ] ) the last equality relates the third moment of @xmath34 , the first moment of @xmath53 and static correlation functions . for spin - fermion models in the limit of low doping , the spin - spin correlation functions are only involved in ( [ b1a1 ] ) .",
    "below we show that non - crossing approximation violates sumrule ( [ sigsrule2 ] ) and is obviously wrong in strong coupling limit @xmath22 .",
    "in practice , projection technique calculations are possible only for finite basis set and only finite number of continued fraction levels is possible to calculate in ( [ cf ] ) .    in the frameworks of our model we have @xmath54 @xmath55 thus the bare electron operator @xmath56 with one - site spin",
    "polaron operator @xmath57 represent the natural basis set for appropriate account of local correlations .",
    "it is important that this set is closed relative to @xmath58 , i.e. @xmath59 = j\\sqrt{f_2}b_r,\\quad \\left [ b_r , \\hat h_{int}\\right ] = j\\left ( \\sqrt{f_2}a_r - b_r\\right ) .\\ ] ] now the commutation relation @xmath60 = -t\\sum_g\\tilde s _ { r+r}a_{r+g}+j\\tilde s_{r+r}\\tilde s_ra_r+\\left [ \\tilde s_{r+r}a_r,\\hat h _ s\\right]\\ ] ] is projected onto the basis set in order to decouple the equation of motion for higher order gf @xmath61 in the following , we neglect the spin excitation energy @xmath62",

    "it means that @xmath71 automatically satisfies the sumrules ( [ b0a0 ] ) , ( [ sigsrule ] ) and ( [ sigsrule2 ] ) .    near the band bottom",
    "@xmath70 and @xmath72 should have the form @xmath73 @xmath74 here @xmath75 and @xmath76 are quasiparticle energy and pole strength respectively .",
    "the incoherent part .",

    "now it is easy to show that @xmath79 represents an _ exact upper bound _ for @xmath75 .",
    "let us consider eigen operator for lowest singlet band @xmath80 the gf @xmath81 has the pole at the same energy as bare fermion gf @xmath70 ( in our model @xmath82 for all @xmath83 ) .",
    "on the other hand , from ( [ a0a ] ) and ( [ eipro ] ) we have @xmath84 \\omega _ { inc},\\ ] ] here @xmath85 is the center of gravity of the incoherent part . as the pole strength is @xmath86 , we have @xmath87 i.e. for any @xmath83 the exact energy @xmath75 lies _ always lower _ then the energy given by two pole approximation .    in the strong coupling limit that gives @xmath88 and from ( [ polepos ] )",
    "it follows that actual pole position is lower than @xmath89 .",
    "it is not difficult to calculate next continued fraction coefficient @xmath90 in the approximate equality we took into account that main contribution to the sum over @xmath91 comes from the vicinity of @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "we see that @xmath94 is of the order of kinetic energy @xmath95 .",
    "it means that small polaron formed by our basic operators interact with the spin subsystem much weaker than the bare hole .",
    "so , the expected polaron energy renormalization from @xmath79 to @xmath75 is of the order of @xmath96 .",
    "from the above consideration it follows that the two - pole expression ( [ twopole ] ) is useful in strong coupling limit . in the opposite case @xmath24",
    "it becomes not appropriate because it gives the self - energy in the one pole form @xmath97 and can not describe the damping of quasiparticle .",
    "the reason is in the approximate treatment of the kinetic energy term in course of the projection of the equation for @xmath98 ( [ emgfb ] ) .",
    "here we propose a generalization of projection technique that completely removes this default and makes it possible to exactly take into account the kinetic energy term .",

    "we have used the local character of operator @xmath109 that gives @xmath110 .",
    "thus eq.([em2 ] ) may be rewritten as @xmath111 now equation for @xmath99 is @xmath112 explicit calculation gives ( @xmath113 ) @xmath114 and we obtain the following form for the fermion self - energy @xmath115 in the weak coupling limit @xmath24 this expression coincides with the second order result of perturbation theory @xmath116 which corresponds to the projection ( [ ksq ] ) only on the first operator @xmath117 . in this limit a polaron of large radius is formed and bare fermion represents slightly damping quasiparticle .",
    "now let us show that the self - energy ( [ sigmax ] ) also give correct result in the strong coupling limit .",
    "the pole position is given by @xmath118 .",
    "for determination of lowest band position we may neglect the @xmath119 compared @xmath120 and write @xmath121 , then @xmath122 @xmath123 the perturbation theory result is @xmath124 @xmath125    the reason of the perturbation theory fail is the violation of the sum rule ( [ sigsrule2 ] ) .",
    "we have @xmath126 @xmath127 @xmath128 comparing ( [ a1pert ] ) with the exact value given by eq .",
    "( [ matel ] ) we see the absence of terms proportional to @xmath129 that give completely wrong result for @xmath22 .",
    "it is not difficult to prove that summation of the infinite series of non crossing diagrams for the self energy does not change the value of @xmath130 ( [ a1pert ] ) .",
    "indeed , the non - crossing ( self - consistent born ) approximation gives @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the energy of spin excitations .",
    "we then have @xmath133 and obtain the same result ( [ a1pert ] ) because @xmath132 is negligible , at least in the vicinity of @xmath134 .",
    "moreover , the self - energy ( [ noncr ] ) leads to the absence of quasiparticles .",
    "we may write @xmath135 , then @xmath136 ^{-1}=\\left [ \\omega -\\epsilon _ p-\\frac{j^2f_2}{\\omega -\\epsilon _ { p+q}-j^2f_2g_a(p,\\omega ) } \\right ] ^{-1}.\\ ] ] solution of the quadratic equation gives the expression for green s function @xmath137 which has no poles .",
    "analogous result was obtained previously in ref.@xcite .",
    "on figure 1a , b we present the spectral density @xmath138 that corresponds to three different representation of fermion self - energy : two pole approximation , eq .",

    "( [ sigmax ] ) , and second order perturbation theory , eq .",
    "( [ sigpert ] ) .",
    "we took the value @xmath139 that is typical for underdoped cuprates @xcite . for spin - spin correlation function we took the expression @xmath140 which is provided by spherically symmetric theory for heisenberg model on square lattice @xcite ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "we calculate the function @xmath142 by direct summation over @xmath143 @xmath144points in brillouin zone ( the results for @xmath145 and @xmath146 are almost indistinguishable ) . from fiq.1",
    "we see that the lowest pole position obtained by generalized projection method satisfy the relation ( [ bound ] ) , in contrast to that given by perturbation theory .",
    "figure 2 shows the spectral function in generalized projection method for various values of @xmath83 along the diagonal of brillouin zone .",
    "quasiparticle pole exists throughout the whole brillouin zone .",
    "quasiparticle dispersion @xmath147 has only approximate symmetry relative to the boundary of antiferromagnetic brillouin zone .",
    "strong asymmetry of the spectral weight in the generalized projection method is the consequence of the sumrule ( [ a0a ] ) - center of gravity @xmath148 should coincide with @xmath149 .",
    "so , near the point @xmath150 , where the quasiparticle peak is far from @xmath151 , its weight is small .",
    "we have shown above that the expression ( [ sigmax ] ) gives reasonable solutions both in weak and strong coupling limits .",

    "we have resonant solutions near the bottom ( @xmath157 ) and the top ( @xmath158 ) of bare fermionic band respectively .",
    "near @xmath159 we have pure incoherent spectrum .",
    "we have considered spin - fermion model that is often used for description of strongly correlated systems .",
    "we have compared two popular approaches to the calculation of fermionic green s function : the non - crossing approximation of perturbation theory and mori - zwantzig projection technique .",
    "we have shown that first one is valid only in the weak coupling regime and the second one only in the strong coupling regime .",
    "the non - crossing approximation gives wrong position of lowest quasiparticle band .",
