    "while the origin of species has always been a central subject in evolutionary biology , the large number of recent empirical and theoretical developments has renewed the interest in the area @xcite .",
    "individual - based simulations , in particular , have been successful in fostering relevant discussions in speciation @xcite .",
    "specifically , simulations in which mating is restricted by spatial and genetic distances have been able to describe empirical patterns of species diversity @xcite and within - species genetical diversity @xcite .",
    "one of the simplest ways of introducing assortativeness in mating in a individual - based simulation is to attribute haploid genomes with @xmath0 biallelic loci to individuals and allow them to mate only if the genomes differ in no more than @xmath1 loci @xcite .",
    "this approach considers that mate choice often relies on multiple cues that are determined genetically @xcite . in the case of assortative mating",
    ", we assume that individuals have a certain tolerance to differences when choosing a mate , however if the other individual is too different , it will no longer be considered a potential mate . under these assumptions ,",
    "reproductive isolation was shown to be maintained among demes in the presence of sufficiently low migration rates @xcite .",
    "spatially explicit versions of this process have also been studied @xcite and , in particular , speciation was shown to emerge spontaneously if mating is also constrained by the spatial distance @xcite .    in order to reflect the dynamics of evolving populations , most simulations need to incorporate several ingredients simultaneously , such as mutation , genetic drift , recombination , assortativeness in mating and individual s movement and spatial positioning .",
    "gavrilets @xcite proposed and analysed a number of simplified mathematical models that are closely related to these simulations , including selection , mutation , drift and population structure . these more realistic approaches to speciation do not allow for the detailed understanding of how each of the mechanisms involved contribute to the emergence and maintenance of reproductive isolation .    to construct a dynamical theory that accounts for the predictions of the model described in @xcite and other similar models , it is important to understand the roles of their different ingredients and to validate their generality",
    ". it has already been shown that separation of individuals into males and females does not introduce important effects in the conditions for speciation @xcite , originally based on hermaphrodite populations . in this paper",
    "we focus on the effect of genetic incompatibility and work out the theory for infinitely large populations with two biallelic loci ( @xmath2 ) without mutations .",
    "genetic incompatibilities will be implemented by allowing reproduction only if the alleles from the parents differ at most in one locus ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this is the simplest system for which the genetical mechanism of interest may be implemented .",
    "we will show that this process leads to evolution by changing the allele frequencies and that it is one of the main ingredients in the process of speciation studied in @xcite . despite the changes in all allele frequencies",
    ", we will demonstrate that a certain combination of frequencies from the two loci remain constant during the evolution , revealing a strong correlation between the loci introduced by the genetic mating restriction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ mod_reprod ]",
    "we describe the reproductive mechanism employed in the dynamics . in section [ no_restrictions ]",
    "we characterize the evolution of a population subjected to no mating restrictions ( random mating ) , which is similar to the hardy - weinberg ( hw ) equilibrium",
    ". the mathematical implications of the genetic restriction , including the description of equilibria and their features , are analyzed in section [ con_restr ] .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusions ] we expose our conclusions and discuss the possible evolutionary impacts of our results .",

    "consider a population of @xmath4 hermaphrodite individuals with haplotypes @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 being the alleles at the locus 1 , and @xmath0 and @xmath11 the alleles at the locus 2 ) , whose composition at the generation @xmath12 is characterized by the numbers @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 , with @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) .",

    "we specify the values of the probabilities @xmath21 by setting the total number of individuals constant along generations .",
    "this section summarizes the outcomes for the case of no genetic restrictions .",
    "although some of the results described in here can be found in the literature ( see for example @xcite ) , the following discussion is fundamental as a reference for comparing the results presented next .",
    "if random mating is assumed , @xmath30 for every encounter .",
    "substituting in equations ( [ conn_1]-[conn_4 ] ) and summing up , one obtains    @xmath31    so that @xmath32 for very large populations . by introducing @xmath33 ,",
    "the so called linkage disequilibrium , and after some algebra , equations for the haplotype frequencies read @xmath34 from which one immediately sees that a sufficient condition for the equilibrium is @xmath35 , or @xmath36 .",
    "notice that the quantities @xmath37 representing the frequencies of the four available alleles , remain constant from the first generation .",
    "this is also the case in the hw equilibrium context , however it should be emphasized that in the present framework there are two independent allele frequencies ( because @xmath38 ) in contrast to the hw equilibrium where the only independent variable is the frequency of one of the two available alleles .",
    "the time dependence of the haplotype frequencies can be obtained analytically ( see appendix [ appendixa ] ) .",
    "here we just look for a relationship between the haplotype and the allele frequencies.we start calculating @xmath39 at time @xmath20 , @xmath40 whose solution is simply @xmath41 @xmath42 being the initial value of @xmath39 . combining ( [ allele_a]-[allele_b ] ) and ( [ sr11]-[sr14 ] ) , it is possible to deduce the following relationships ( see appendix [ appendixb ] ) @xmath43    accordingly , the haplotype frequencies reach an equilibrium asymptotically and , as in the case of the hw equilibrium , is related to the constant alleles frequencies , @xmath44 it is important to remark the asymptotic behavior of the haplotype frequencies toward the equilibrium ( equations ( [ pab_t]-[pab_t ] ) ) , in contrast to hw theorem in which the equilibrium of the genotype frequencies is attained in one generation .",
    "to mathematically describe the mating restriction imposed to individuals differing in more than one allele , we simply redefine the compatibility - viability rate as follows    @xmath45    following the procedure of section [ no_restrictions ] , we obtain @xmath46 with @xmath47    notice that @xmath48 is not constant , in contrast to the rate @xmath49 of section [ no_restrictions ] , but varies along generations depending on how many incompatible encounters may take place .",
    "the more incompatible encounters , the bigger the chance of a compatible encounter to give an offspring viable for the next generation .    by substituting ( [ rprime ] ) in ( [ rh1h2 ] ) , and ( [ rh1h2 ] ) in ( [ conn_1]-[conn_4 ] ) , equations for the haplotype frequencies reduce to    @xmath50    in what follows , we explore the dynamics governed by equations ( [ freq_comres_1]-[freq_comres_4 ] ) on the basis of a stability analysis .      equations ( [ freq_comres_1]-[freq_comres_4 ] ) display four different types of fixed points , summarized in table [ fixedpoints ] . as we will see next , only types 1 and 2 are stable .",

    "the stability matrix of @xmath72 displays two different eigenvalues , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , the latter with degeneration 2 .",

    "fixed points of types 1 and 2 deserve a more detailed description .",
    "not displaying exactly the same properties , they share common features , which makes instructive to analyze the stability of both types at the same time .",
    "we take as an example the set of points @xmath53 , and its @xmath92 and @xmath93 limits , which are the points @xmath60 and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "appendix [ appendixc ] explains how to transfer the outcomes of the following analysis to the remaining type 1 and type 2 fixed points .",
    "the stability matrix for any of such points has the following eigenvalues and eigenvectors :    * @xmath94 : @xmath95 .",
    "* @xmath96 : @xmath97 .",
    "* @xmath98 : @xmath99 .    in the first place ,",
    "notice that along the direction spanned by @xmath100 displacements are neutral .",
    "indeed , since @xmath98 for all points in the set , displacements from the fixed points in this direction are not amplified nor contracted .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that this direction corresponds to the @xmath76 axis itself , where the entire set @xmath53 is located .",
    "therefore , by displacing a point from a fixed point in this direction one simply moves to another fixed point and thus iterations do not evolve it further .    in the directions spanned by @xmath101 and @xmath102 ,",
    "the eigenvalues show that the fixed points @xmath53 are stable ( points @xmath60 and @xmath62 are also stable , however the stability can not be inferred from the eigenvalues ) .",
    "notice that , properly scaled , eigenvectors @xmath101 and @xmath102 have the interesting property of connecting the fixed points @xmath53 ( as well as @xmath60 and @xmath62 ) with the points @xmath68 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "this property , illustrated in figure [ vectorsitos ] , will be used in section [ conserved ] .",
    "( green ) and @xmath103 ( brown ) corresponding to the points @xmath104 ( with @xmath105 ) , @xmath60 and @xmath62 . ]",
    "although the qualitative behavior of any fixed point in the set @xmath53 is the same ( one neutral direction and two stable directions pointing to type 3 fixed points ) , and even for the extremes @xmath60 and @xmath62 , points within the set differ from each other in the time to convergence .",
    "close to the fixed points the movement along a given eigendirection obeys @xmath106 so that @xmath107 ( @xmath108 being the i - th component of the initial displacement from the fixed point , for @xmath109 ) with @xmath110 this allows to compare the time constants in the directions @xmath101 and @xmath102 as the parameter @xmath111 varies along the set .",
    "the ratio gives @xmath112 accordingly , by displacing the fixed point close to the point @xmath60 ( @xmath113 ) , the time of convergence along @xmath102 becomes much larger compared to the time along @xmath101 .",
    "the opposite behavior is obtained by displacing the fixed point towards @xmath62 ( @xmath114 ) .    for @xmath111",
    "strictly equal to zero , estimation ( [ time_estimation ] ) yields an infinitely slow convergence along @xmath102 , and an instantaneous convergence along @xmath101 .",
    "this is however a consequence of the attempt to linearize an equation with no linear contribution in its series expansion . since @xmath115 along @xmath101 , we can rewrite equation ( [ freq_comres_1 ] ) as @xmath116 whose leading order is quadratic .",
    "we write therefore @xmath117 for points close to @xmath60 , whose leading order solution reads @xmath118 besides demonstrating stability , this solution shows that convergence is superfast in comparison to the exponential behavior for points @xmath104 ( equation ( [ soluc_p1 ] ) ) .    in the @xmath102 direction @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "therefore , we rewrite equation ( [ freq_comres_2 ] ) as @xmath121    even by neglecting the @xmath122 term , this equation does not have a closed solution @xcite .",
    "yet , it is possible to extract a conclusion concerning stability and convergence rate .",
    "successive iterations of equation ( [ p01paralambda0v2 ] ) give @xmath123 where @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "accordingly , for times @xmath126 and points close to the fixed point along @xmath102 , @xmath127 which again demonstrates stability , however a convergence results superslow when compared with points @xmath53 .",
    "numerical computations demonstrate that the right hand result is still valid for times arbitrarily large ( see appendix [ appendixe ] ) .",
    "quantities not changing in time give powerful insights in the understanding of dynamical problems . in the absence of restrictions in reproduction , allele frequencies @xmath128 and @xmath129 remain constant and this property characterizes the equilibrium ( [ constant_allele_frequencies_1]-[constant_allele_frequencies_4 ] ) . surprisingly , the dynamics under genetic restrictions has also a conserved quantity that , being different from the frequencies of the alleles , allows for a complete description of the dynamics and the equilibria .    through equations ( [ freq_comres_1]-[freq_comres_4 ] )",
    "it can be shown that all allele frequencies obey the same evolution equation @xmath130 for @xmath131 . writing this equation for @xmath132 and @xmath133 and",
    "dividing one by the other implies that the quantity @xmath134 remains constant across generations .",
    "this implies that in the 3-dimensional haplotype phase space , the dynamics is constrained to the plane defined by the equation @xmath135 referred from now on as @xmath136-plane .",
    "notice that the three aligned points @xmath68 , @xmath70 and @xmath72 are contained in the @xmath136-plane for any @xmath136 . changing the value of @xmath136 simply rotates the @xmath136-plane around the axis defined by these three points , making the description of the dynamics quite simple .",
    "specifically , the location of the @xmath136-plane unambiguously determines two stable fixed points , which can be    1 .",
    "@xmath53 and @xmath57 for @xmath137 2 .",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath55 for @xmath138 3 .",
    "@xmath60 and @xmath64 for @xmath139 4 .   @xmath66 and @xmath62 for @xmath140 .",
    "the stable eigenvectors @xmath141 and @xmath142 , in turn , run along the borders of the @xmath136-plane .",
    "the dynamics reduces therefore to a 2-dimensional hyperbolic motion with the central fixed point @xmath72 attracting trajectories in one direction ( corresponding to the @xmath143 axis ) and repelling in the other direction .",
    "the latter , unstable direction , gives rise to the unstable manifold connecting @xmath72 with two stable fixed points ( in any of the four combinations listed above ) .",
    "figure [ trajectories ] illustrates the picture for @xmath144 .    from the previous paragraph results that by setting the plane of motion",
    ", initial conditions almost determine the equilibrium distribution of haplotype frequencies .",
    "there is still an ambiguity concerning which of the two stable fixed points intersected by the @xmath136-plane is attained .",
    "of course , this ambiguity is solved by determining to which side respect to the the @xmath143 axis the initial condition is located . as we demonstrate next , a simple algorithm to determine the latter issue consists in computing initial values of ( [ allele_a]-[allele_b ] ) , and identifying the allele in the minor proportion .",
    "the right panel of figure [ ptos_fixos ] depicts a division of the haplotype space in four regions , and two planes forming the frontiers between them .",
    "these planes correspond to @xmath139 , and @xmath140 . in terms of the alleles frequencies",
    ", a straightforward calculation shows that on the @xmath145-plane @xmath146 , whereas on the @xmath147-plane @xmath148 . accordingly , in one and only one of the four regions , the alleles frequencies should satisfy    * @xmath149 * @xmath150    but the second relation implies @xmath151 , which necessarily means @xmath152 and thus @xmath153 .",
    "this region of the haplotype space is therefore characterized by the fact that the allele @xmath9 is the allele in the minor proportion . as type 1",
    "fixed points labeled @xmath51 ( in purple in figure [ ptos_fixos ] ) have necessarily this property , it turns out that the region in consideration must contain all points in the phase space that are attracted to this set of fixed points .",
    "the conclusion is that points shadowed in light purple in figure [ ptos_fixos ] are the points with allele a in the minor proportion , and evolve to fixed points @xmath51 .",
    "similar arguments allow to conclude that the light blue region contains initial conditions having allele @xmath0 in the minor proportion ( evolving to fixed points @xmath53 ) , light red region contains initial conditions with allele @xmath10 in the minor proportion ( evolving to fixed points @xmath55 ) , and finally , light cyan region contains initial conditions with allele @xmath11 in the minor proportion ( evolving to fixed points @xmath57 ) .    , and a set of trajectories with initial conditions chosen close to the stable manifold of @xmath72 . in the right pannel ,",

    "first , it is necessary to establish the @xmath136-plane where the initial condition is located and , second , the allele in the smaller proportion . in the example of figure [ trajectories ] ,",
    "a bunch of trajectories is simulated taking initial conditions close to the @xmath143 axis and having @xmath144 .",
    "the @xmath136-plane intersects the @xmath53 set for the initial conditions having @xmath0 in the smaller proportion and the @xmath57 set for initial conditions having @xmath11 in the smaller proportion . from the conservation of @xmath144 results that at equilibrium the first bunch of trajectories converge to the point given by @xmath156 , and the second bunch of trajectories to the point given by @xmath158 .",
    "the practical result of this analysis is that the smallest among the initial allelic frequencies always goes to zero .",
    "this information , together with the conserved quantity @xmath136 suffices to determine all frequencies .",

    "the procedure outlined in sections [ conserved ] and [ equilibrium ] to predict the equilibrium from the initial conditions , in addition to the information provided in section [ rates ] concerning times to convergence , represent the full solution of the dynamics of the two - loci problem subjected to genetic restricted mating .",
    "geometrically , the dynamics reduces to a foliation of the 3-dimensional haplotype space in planes with a very simple motion , consisting of a central hyperbolic point repelling trajectories towards two stable equilibria .",
    "initial conditions and stable equilibria remain related through the existence of a conserved quantity @xmath136 , which defines the planes where the hyperbolic motion takes place .    on the basis of times to convergence ,",
    "stable equilibria can be divided in two categories .",
    "stable equilibria of type 1 are attained exponentially , whereas type 2 equilibria are attained at much slower rates ( @xmath164 , @xmath165 being the distance to the fixed point ) .",
    "it is interesting to observe that this classification has a biological counterpart .",
    "specifically , slow - attained equilibria represent monomorphic populations , whereas exponentially - attained equilibria correspond to populations that are polymorphic at a single locus .",
    "double - polymorphic populations are unstable ( points of type 3 and 4 ) or evolve to any of the former scenarios , reveling the fact that genetic restricted mating has the net effect of a selection . as pointed out in @xcite , models of incompatibility based on genetic distance have two alternative interpretations .",
    "one interpretation corresponds to sexual haploid populations with fitness assigned to pairs of individuals ( here fitness is included in the rate @xmath166 ) , and the second interpretation concerns diploid populations reproducing through random mating , where fitness is a function of individual heterozygosity .",
    "accordingly , the model studied in this work describes an evolution process that eliminates double polymorphism ( first interpretation ) or alternatively a selection against double heterozigotes ( second interpretation ) .",
    "selection against heterozigote is also known as underdominance , and explains the disruptive selection causing sympatric speciation @xcite .",
    "section [ conserved ] revels another important aspect of restriction through genetic distance , which concerns the fact that the allele initially appearing in the smallest proportion remains always in the minor proportion , and vanish when the equilibrium is attained .",
    "the existence of the conserved quantity @xmath136 , in turn , also has an interesting consequence from the biological point of view .",
    "as @xmath167 represents the maximum polymorphism at the first locus , @xmath168 can be interpreted as a measure of the monomorphism for that gene .",
    "accordingly , the fact that @xmath169 remains constant along evolution , establishes that the correlation between the polymorphism at the two loci does not change .    in the general situation of @xmath0 genes and mating genetic restriction by a distance @xmath1 ,",
    "stable equilibria are expected to be of @xmath170 different types , in the form of full monomorphic populations , polymorphic populations at a single locus , polymorphic populations at only two loci , etc , up to polymorphic populations at the @xmath1 loci .",
    "accordingly , such scenarios can be related to an elimination of @xmath171-uple to @xmath0-uple polymorphic populations , or alternatively as a selection against @xmath171-uple to @xmath0-uple heterozygotes .",
    "these results will be demonstrated in a subsequent publication . in a spatially structured population",
    "it might happen that different regions converge to different equilibria , resulting in reproductively isolated species as obtained in @xcite . as the case studied here",
    "exhibits reproductive isolation only in the trivial way accomplished by monomorphic species ( for instance , populations @xmath5 and @xmath8 are isolated with genetic distance within the populations @xmath172 ) , it is of special interest to explicitly consider the case @xmath173 and @xmath3 .",
    "in this situation , populations @xmath174 and @xmath175 are reproductively isolated with @xmath176 .",
    "moreover , the existence of a third single polymorphic species @xmath177 , or even the monomorphic species @xmath178 , may create an ring structure , revealing the richness of scenarios that can be realized through this simple arrangement . from the analysis of the times to convergence of section [ rates ] , it is also expected that times to convergence for @xmath3 will behave in the same way even for @xmath179 , displaying an exponential behavior for single polymorphic species , and a superslow convergence for monomorphic species . these times to convergence",
    "should eventually be compared with the time to fixation driven by random drift . as the model studied here assumes infinite size populations ,",
    "the model should be modified to take finite populations into account . a possible way to estimate the time to fixation driven by random drift",
