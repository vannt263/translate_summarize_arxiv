    "it is possible to carry out nonlocal quantum operations on multipartite systems using only local quantum operations and classical communications ( locc ) provided that the parties involved have access to a suitable entangled state , referred to as a resource . given a large enough resource it is always possible to use teleportation to send all inputs to one party , who performs the operation and then distributes the results to the other parties using teleportation . in some cases it is possible to perform a nonlocal operation with less entanglement than is required by teleportation  @xcite .",
    "the question then arises as to how much entanglement is really necessary in order to implement a given nonlocal operation .",
    "our first result , that the schmidt rank of the resource must be at least as great as that of the unitary [ theorem  1(a ) ] , follows rather immediately from the fact that it is a separable ( sep ) operation .",
    "this is analogous to the result given in  @xcite in which probabilistic ( i.e.  slocc ) implementations are considered . since sep is contained in slocc , our theorem  1(a ) can be seen as a consequence of the result in  @xcite , however we provide an independent proof along the way to our main result .",
    "in contrast to the probabilistic case , the deterministic implementation of a unitary is only possible if the state meets certain entanglement requirements .",
    "for one thing , the entanglement of the resource must be at least as great as the entangling power of the unitary since entanglement can not increase under sep  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that any deterministic controlled - unitary operator on two qubits implemented with bipartite locc using a resource of two entangled qubits necessarily requires a maximally entangled resource  @xcite .",
    "our paper takes a different approach to the problem , using sep , and provides a proof applicable to general unitaries of arbitrary dimension .",
    "we show that if the resource has schmidt rank equal to that of the unitary , the resource must be uniformly entangled in the sense that all its nonzero schmidt coefficients are the same [ theorem  1(b ) ] .",
    "these same restrictions apply to locc , as it is a particular case of sep .",
    "it is not hard to see that if the schmidt rank of the resource is greater than the schmidt rank of the unitary , then the resource need not be uniformly entangled ( e.g.  a larger rank resource that is majorized by a smaller rank maximally entangled state ) .",
    "we have found that it is in fact possible for such a larger rank resource to have less entanglement than would be required for a resource of schmidt rank equal to that of the unitary .",
    "we have found examples of protocols in both sep and locc which deterministically implement a controlled phase operation using less than one ebit of entanglement . in this case",
    "the unitary has schmidt rank two and the resource has schmidt rank three .",
    "although the nonlocal unitary protocol given in  @xcite can with certain probability consume less than one ebit of entanglement   state , which has one ebit of entanglement .",
    "thus , if the protocol only has access to a state with less than one ebit of entanglement there is a nonzero probability that the protocol can not be carried out successfully . ]",
    ", we believe that ours is the first example of carrying out such a protocol deterministically using less than one ebit of entanglement .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : sep ] sets up the problem of bipartite deterministic implementations of unitary operators using sep .",
    "section  [ sec : duality ] provides the requisite background regarding map - state duality  @xcite and atemporal diagrams  @xcite .",

    "[ sec : main ] using what we believe to be a new method based on the use of map - state duality . in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] we consider the case of a resource of larger schmidt rank .",
    "there is a brief conclusion in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] . an appendix details the implementation of a controlled unitary using a qutrit resource state of less than one ebit of entanglement .",
    "we are interested in carrying out a bipartite unitary map @xmath0 , using as a resource an entangled state @xmath1 on two ancillary systems @xmath2 and @xmath3 , by means of a separable operation @xmath4 , @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 together form a product kraus operator . for @xmath8 to be unitary",
    "it is necessary that the dimensions of the hilbert spaces satisfy @xmath9 , but we do not require that @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "the separable operation must satisfy the usual closure condition  @xcite @xmath12 which is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "in addition , for @xmath13 any pure input state on @xmath14 , the outcome of the operation will be a pure state @xmath15 on @xmath16 .",
    "since the protocol is assumed to be deterministic , every term on the right side is proportional to the same pure state and it must be the case that @xmath17 with @xmath18 some complex number . note that both sides of are operators acting on @xmath19 ; fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) will help interpreting it correctly .",
    "the resource @xmath1 is assumed to have a schmidt rank of @xmath20 , which means it can be written in the form @xmath21 for suitable orthonormal bases @xmath22 and @xmath23 of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , with schmidt coefficients @xmath26 for @xmath27 .    similarly , the bipartite operator @xmath8 is assumed to have a schmidt rank of @xmath28 , meaning that it can be written in the form  @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are bases of the operator spaces @xmath32 and @xmath33 , orthonormal under the frobenius ( hilbert - schmidt ) inner product , and @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath28 is the minimum number of terms needed in order to write @xmath8 in the form @xmath36 , without requiring @xmath37 or @xmath38 to be from an orthonormal basis .",
    "_ map - state duality _",
    "@xcite plays a central role in the proof that will follow .",
    "this is a general concept that is sometimes referred to as reshaping or a partial transpose  @xcite and in a specific manifestation is known as the jamiokowski or sometimes the choi - jamiokowski isomorphism .",
    "states and maps are considered to both be tensors , and when a choice of orthonormal basis is fixed there is a natural linear relation between bras and kets ( i.e.  @xmath39 for all basis vectors @xmath40 )  .    with this identification between bras and kets in place , the bipartite state @xmath1 on the hilbert space @xmath41",
    "can be identified with the linear map @xmath42 obtained by turning kets into bras on the @xmath3 space : @xmath43 similarly , the operators @xmath8 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , give rise to @xmath46 ( by turning bras into kets on @xmath47 and kets into bras on @xmath48 ) , @xmath49 ( by turning bras into kets on @xmath47 ) , and @xmath50 ( by turning bras into kets on @xmath3 and kets into bras on @xmath48 ) , @xmath51 in the case of these three operators , _ map - map duality _ may be a more precise term , however we will use map - state duality to refer to any such partial transpose .",
    "the primed operator for @xmath45 is denoted as @xmath52 in order to draw attention to the fact that its domain and range are swapped in comparison to @xmath53 .",
    "the equations introduced so far make use of six distinct hilbert spaces and tensors of various rank . in such situations",
    "the underlying structure of equations can be somewhat hidden when expressed using dirac notation .",
    "abstract index notation is more transparent but can become unwieldy .",
    "for this reason we provide atemporal diagrams , similar to those found in  @xcite , which should aid the reader in following the arguments in the text .",
    "operators are designated by squares or rectangular boxes . as a matter of style",
    ", the state @xmath1 and its corresponding operator @xmath54 will be represented as a circle instead of a square .",
    "lines between these boxes represent tensor contraction , and these lines are labeled by the hilbert spaces which they correspond to .",
    "open lines on the left of a diagram represent the input to the total linear operator defined by the diagram , and open lines on the right represent outputs .",
    "putting the inputs on the left means that operators are to be applied in a left - to - right manner , opposite to how algebraic equations are interpreted .",
    "as has been so far described , our diagrams are to be interpreted in exactly the same way as traditional quantum circuits as used for example in nielsen and chuang  @xcite .",
    "the primary difference between our diagrams and traditional circuits is that in the latter the horizontal direction is understood to represent the passage of time whereas our diagrams make no reference to time .",
    "the presence of a summation symbol has the obvious meaning : the linear operator depicted in the diagram denotes the terms of a series .",
    "the trace or partial trace operation is just a special case of tensor contraction and is denoted by joining the relevant spaces with a line .",
    "the identity operator is represented by a line . with minor changes in style our diagrams",
    "are equivalent to the atemporal diagrams of  @xcite , and resemble other such schemes  @xcite .    .",

    "our main result is the following :    [ thm : max_entangled ] suppose that a unitary operator @xmath8 is implemented deterministically by a separable operation that makes use of the pure state entanglement resource @xmath1 [ i.e.  suppose that and hold ]",
    ". then    the schmidt rank @xmath20 of @xmath1 is greater than or equal to the schmidt rank @xmath28 of @xmath8 .",
    "if the schmidt ranks are equal , @xmath58 , then @xmath1 must be a uniformly ( maximally ) entangled state : all the nonzero schmidt coefficients are the same .    making use of map - state duality and the operators defined in and , equation [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ] can be rewritten as [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ] @xmath59 since the rank of a product of linear operators is at most the smallest of the ranks of the individual operators , it follows that @xmath60 .",
    "the rank of an operator is equal to the number of its nonzero singular values .",
    "since the schmidt decompositions and are essentially singular value decompositions of @xmath54 and @xmath61 , it is apparent that @xmath62 and @xmath63 and the inequality becomes @xmath64 .",
    "part ( a ) is proved .",
    "apply the closure condition to @xmath55 and use the adjoint of to obtain @xmath65 as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig1](d ) ] @xmath67    the map @xmath61 may in general have rank less than the dimension of @xmath68 or @xmath69 ( which need not be equal to each other ) . in this case it will be useful to denote by @xmath70 the subspace of @xmath71 which forms the _ support _ ( or co - image or row space ) of @xmath61 , the orthogonal complement of its kernel ( null space ) , and by @xmath72 the subspace of @xmath69 that forms the _ range _ ( or image ) of @xmath61 .",
    "each of these subspaces has a dimension equal to @xmath28 , and @xmath61 is a nonsingular ( invertible ) linear map of @xmath70 onto @xmath72 , which we hereafter denote by @xmath73 . in the same way one can introduce subspaces @xmath74 and @xmath75 of @xmath25 and @xmath24 which form the support and range of @xmath54 , and define @xmath76 to be the corresponding nonsingular map of rank @xmath20 from @xmath74 to @xmath75",
    "next , @xmath77 is @xmath53 with its domain restricted to @xmath75 , which can be strictly smaller than the support of @xmath53 , and with its range restricted to @xmath72 , which could be smaller than the image of @xmath53 .",
    "finally , @xmath78 is @xmath52 regarded as a map from @xmath68 to @xmath25 , but with domain and range restricted to @xmath70 and @xmath74 , respectively   as @xmath52 restricted to subspaces . in general it is not the case that @xmath79 is equal to @xmath80 restricted to subspaces . ] .",
    "the result of restricting to the subspaces just defined is @xmath81 corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig1](e ) . multiplying on the left by @xmath56 and tracing over @xmath82",
    "gives @xmath83 see fig .",
    "[ fig1](f ) and ( g ) . restricting to subspaces results in @xmath84",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) .",
    "here we have restricted the spaces over which matrix multiplications are being performed ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 instead of @xmath25 and @xmath24 ) , however equality is still maintained because the dimensions which have been eliminated correspond to the zero schmidt coefficients of @xmath1 , which is to say the zero singular values of @xmath54 .    to complete the proof ,",
    "make use of the assumption @xmath85 .",
    "then @xmath20 is also the rank of @xmath86 and @xmath87 : all four operators in are full rank . taking the inverse of both sides and inserting the result for @xmath88 in leads to the result @xmath89 where @xmath90 follows from , and the normalization of @xmath1 .",
    "with @xmath1 in schmidt form , @xmath91 is diagonal , so @xmath92",
    ". therefore all the nonzero schmidt coefficients of @xmath1 are equal to @xmath93 .",
    "we have proved that a resource that is of the smallest viable schmidt rank must be maximally entangled , but it is also possible to use a resource that is of higher schmidt rank that is not maximally entangled .",
    "for one thing , if such a state meets an appropriate majorization criterion it can be deterministically transformed into a maximally entangled state  @xcite . in this case",
    "the larger rank initial resource would have greater entanglement than would be required if the smaller maximally entangled state had been used in the first place .",
    "there is however the possibility that some protocol could be devised to use a resource of larger schmidt rank that has less entanglement than the maximally entangled state of smaller rank .",
    "in fact , we have numerically found examples of such constructions in both sep and locc .",
    "one solution in sep uses a resource state @xmath94 on two qutrits to implement the two qubit controlled unitary operator @xmath95 with @xmath96 .",
    "we have verified this to be an exact solution using a computer algebra system .",
    "this resource constitutes less than one ebit of entanglement : the von neumann entropy is approximately @xmath97 ebits .",
    "since entropy can not increase under sep  @xcite it is necessary for the resource that is consumed to have greater entanglement than the entangling capacity of the unitary being implemented .",
    "the entangling capacity of this unitary is shown in  @xcite to be approximately @xmath98 ebits .",
    "since this is much less than the @xmath97 ebits that we use , there remains the possibility that a different construction or an even larger rank resource could potentially lower the entanglement cost further .",
    "we also found an locc protocol which , though less efficient than the sep construction just described , allows one to carry out a bipartite unitary deterministically using a resource with less than one ebit of entanglement .",
    "the resource in this case is @xmath99 and the unitary implemented is @xmath95 with @xmath100 .",
    "the von neumann entropy of this resource is approximately @xmath101 ebits , and this is a four round protocol ( alice , bob , alice , bob ) .",
    "the constructions described above are instances of a more general continuous family of solutions that we have found , covering a range of controlled phase operations .",
    "as should be expected , a larger phase @xmath102 requires a larger entanglement resource . in both the sep and the locc case only certain classes of solutions",
    "were searched for , so it is possible that a more thorough search would provide more efficient protocols .",
    "the details of our sep construction are presented in appendix  [ sec : sepappendix ] .",
    "our locc construction consists of a long list of kraus operators in numerical form , which is available upon request .",
    "we have shown that a unitary operator of schmidt rank @xmath103 implemented as a bipartite separable operation requires an entanglement resource of schmidt rank at least @xmath103 .",
    "if the schmidt rank of the resource is exactly equal to @xmath103 , the resource must be uniformly ( maximally ) entangled with equal nonzero schmidt coefficients .",
    "these restrictions apply also to locc , which is a subset of sep .",
    "the proof uses map - state duality in a way which has not ( so far as we know ) been previously applied to problems of this type , so might have other interesting applications .",
    "numerical results show that the amount of entanglement required for the resource can be lowered by using a resource of schmidt rank larger than @xmath103 .",
    "a four round locc protocol has been found which uses a two - qutrit resource state with less than one ebit of entanglement to implement a bipartite controlled phase gate ( albeit with a small phase ) .",
    "although some large classes of unitaries are known to have implementations in locc using resources having the minimal schmidt rank required by theorem  1(a )  @xcite , it is not known whether such minimal - rank implementations are possible for all unitaries .",
    "given a unitary of schmidt rank @xmath28 it is always possible to find a collection of operators @xmath104 such that and are satisfied with a resource of schmidt rank @xmath85 .",
    "but it is not known if there is a separable operation satisfying both and .",
    "consequently , it is possible that some unitaries may require a resource of greater rank than the lower bound given in theorem  1(a ) .",
    "even if such a minimal rank solution is always possible in sep , it still might not be possible in locc .",
    "this stands in contrast to the case of slocc where it is known that any unitary can be implemented using a state of schmidt rank equal to that of the unitary  @xcite .",
    "we thank vlad gheorghiu for his comments .",
    "the research reported here was supported in part by the national science foundation through grant no .",
    "we performed a numerical search for solutions to   and   with the resource and unitary taking the forms @xmath105 in this case the unitary @xmath8 is schmidt rank 2 and the resource is schmidt rank 3 , so the spaces @xmath2 and @xmath3 are each 3 dimensional . in order to reduce the search space we looked for operators @xmath106 and @xmath107 of the form @xmath108 where @xmath109 , @xmath110 with @xmath111 being a two dimensional space , and @xmath112 it is possible to take advantage of the symmetry of the resource @xmath1 by searching for operator sets of the form @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 are defined by @xmath118 @xmath119 , and @xmath120 .",
    "there is no loss of generality in this assumption , since if @xmath121 gives a solution to   and   then so does @xmath122 .",
    "this decreases the number of independent operators ( indexed by @xmath123 ) that need to be solved for , and in fact it turns out to be sufficient to consider only two values of @xmath123 .",
    "initially we searched for solutions with @xmath124 and @xmath125 which , although representing more than one ebit of entanglement , is not majorized by a fully entangled resource of schmidt rank 2 .",
    "once a solution was found , the parameters were variated until a value of @xmath126 was reached which represented a resource of less than one ebit of entanglement .",
    "further constraints were added and variations made to simplify the solution and identify relations between the parameters .",
    "a family of solutions was found of the form with @xmath127 where the parameters @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath126 , and @xmath130 must be solved for numerically .",
    "the asterisks in @xmath131 and @xmath132 represent parameters that can be found using the relation @xmath133 .",
    "a sequence of solutions for @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath126 , and @xmath130 were fed into an inverse symbolic calculator of our own design which uses a lookup table to convert floating point numbers into algebraic expressions .",
    "one of these solutions produced particularly simple algebraic expressions : @xmath134 with this algebraic solution in hand , we used the computer algebra package sage  @xcite to verify that this indeed represented an exact ( not just approximate to within floating point precision ) solution to   and  ."
