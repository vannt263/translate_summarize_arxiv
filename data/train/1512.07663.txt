    "for the next generation cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) experiment , polarbear-2 @xcite , we will build a receiver that has 7,588 tes bolometers coupled to two - band ( 95 and 150 ghz ) polarization - sensitive antennas .",
    "the kilopixel arrays are necessary to achieve the required sensitivity and our science goals .",
    "polarbear-2 is an upgraded experiment based on polarbear-1 , which has measured the b - mode power spectrum @xcite , the deflection power spectrum @xcite and its cross - correlation with cosmic infrared background @xcite .",
    "polarbear-1 is using a readout system with a multiplexing factor of 8 in the frequency domain , with the bolometers biased up to 1 mhz .",
    "polarbear-1 is using analog flux - locked loop ( fll ) to read out the current through the squid amplifier .",
    "the polarbear-2 focal plane is an order of magnitude larger than currently deployed tes arrays .",
    "this requires a large multiplexing factor due to limitations on thermal loading from signal cables .",
    "we are developing readout electronics , which multiplexes 40 tes bolometers through a single superconducting quantum interface device ( squid ) . extending that architecture to 40 bolometers",
    "requires an increase in the bandwidth of the squid electronics , above 4 mhz . since the analog fll limits the usable bandwidth up to 1 mhz , we use digital active nulling ( dan ) @xcite @xcite on the digital frequency - domain multiplexing platform for multiplexing 40 bolometers , as shown in fig .

    "since the resistance of a tes bolometer is small , it is important to design the cryogenic readout electronics carefully , and suppress the series impedance to voltage - bias the tes bolometers . in the following sections",
    ", we will give an overview of requirements placed on the series impedance .      a component that mainly contributes to the series resistance",
    "is an equivalent series resistance ( esr ) of a capacitor forming an lc filter . as dielectric loss in the capacitors become larger at a higher frequency , controlling the esr becomes more important for a readout with a large multiplexing factor , which requires a wide bandwidth .",
    "the series resistance causes instability in electrothermal feedback when @xmath1 with loop gain @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a series resistance , and @xmath4 is a tes resistance @xcite . even with @xmath5 , a non - linear response of the tes bolometer is caused and can create systematic errors with cmb observations . assuming that @xmath6 for our tes bolometers , the non - linear response of the voltage - biased bolometer at a frequency , @xmath7 ,    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the current through the tes",

    "this equation can be derived using equations shown in @xcite .",
    "the equation is valid for cmb observations since we only use frequencies where @xmath7 for data analysis .",
    "if the loop gain @xmath14 is infinite and the series resistance @xmath3 is zero , the gain @xmath15 is constant and the bolometer response is linear .",
    "the series resistance varies the gain as the input power @xmath10 changes .",

    "[ eq : taylor_series2 ] .",
    "the first term expresses linear response and other terms express the non - linear response . when the loop gain is infinite and the series resistance is zero , the non - linear terms become zero and the response is linear .",
    "the second and the last terms in eq .",
    "[ eq : taylor_series2 ] are proportional to the series resistance .",
    "the second term can not be mitigated even with the infinite loop gain .",
    "our goal is @xmath18 , achieved by the polarbear-1 readout , to maintain the non - linearity in the same level .",
    "components that contribute to the series resistance are ( 1 ) equivalent series resistance ( esr ) of a capacitor for an lc filter @xcite ( 2 ) flex cables with copper lines which connect the wafer and the lc filters ( 3 ) contact resistance of connectors ( 4 ) copper traces on printed circuit boards where squids are mounted ( 5 ) a resistor biasing the bolometers ( 30 m@xmath19 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : circuit_diagram ] , the resistive bridge consisting of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , is equivalent to a voltage - source with @xmath21 in series according to thevenin s theorem . since readout lines on the wafer and cables between the lc boards and the squid mounting boards are superconducting , they do nt contribute to the series resistance . in sec .",
    "[ sec : testing ] , we present measurements of the total series resistance .",
    "though the series inductance can also break the constant voltage - biasing condition , most of the inductance in series with the bolometer can be mitigated and does nt appear in eq .",
    "[ eq : responsivity ] .",
    "most of the series inductance can be cancelled by choosing the resonant frequency of the lc filter shifted by the series inductance .",

    "the change in the current through the series inductance @xmath23 in fig .",
    "[ fig : circuit_diagram ] modulates the voltage across the entire lcr circuit , deposits electronic power to the bolometers and leads to cross talk . the series resistance @xmath24 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : circuit_diagram ] also contributes to the voltage modulation . at high frequency , the series impedance @xmath25 is much higher than @xmath24 , and the series resistance is negligible .",
    "note that the current through the squid input coil is cancelled by dan , such that @xmath26 , and the squid input impedance @xmath27 does nt contribute to cross talk .",
    "the electrical cross talk should be smaller than the @xmath28 1% specification set by the size of the cmb signals being measured .",
    "we chose logarithmic spacing to maintain cross talk across the entire readout bandwidth @xcite .",
    "we set targeted series inductance to 60 nh , considering the length of the cold cables ( about 60 cm ) and an achievable inductance ( about 1 nh / cm ) .",
    "based on the series inductance and the acceptable cross talk , the peak frequencies of the lc filters are from 1.6 mhz to 4.2 mhz .",
    "the frequency schedule allows a margin of error of resonant frequencies of the lc filters .",
    "in this section , we present the evaluations of our cryogenic readout in a laboratory fmux setup , shown in fig . [",

    "we used a low inductance cable to connect the lcr circuit ( 0.3 k ) to the bias resistor ( 4 k ) .",
    "the cable consists of two segments : a low - inductance broadside - coupled stripline which has copper lines and high thermal conductivity , and a nbti stripline with a similar geometry .",
    "the nbti stripline was used to isolate the 4 k and 0.3 k stages thermally .",
    "the total inductance for the cryogenic cable was @xmath29 90 nh . we are developing a nbti stripline with a thinner substrate to achieve the targeted series inductance , 60 nh .",
    "the resonant peaks of the lc filters were measured by sweeping a small amplitude probe in frequency , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : netanal ] .",
    "we used the width of a resonant peak , @xmath30 , to measure a resistance in series with an lc filter . when the tes is superconducting , the measured resistance is equal to the sum of the series resistance , @xmath31 .",
    "figure [ fig : rs ] shows the series resistance obtained by fitting the peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig : netanal](b ) .",
    "this is the sum of resistances for all the cryogenic readout electronics , and is higher than the equivalent series resistance of the capacitors in the lc filters , shown in @xcite .",

    "[ fig : rs ] could be originated from a fit function describing a single lcr leg , not considering the stray capacitance , the inductance and the leakage current through neighboring channels in frequency spacing .",
    "the measured resistance meets the requirements , @xmath18 , where @xmath4 in transition is about 1 @xmath19 . using the new cryogenic readout",
    ", we sucessfully tuned the bolometers into the middle of transition .",
    "figure [ fig : rp ] shows examples of the transition curves .",
    "controlling the series resistance and inductance is important to reduce systematic errors for cmb observations .",
    "even a small series resistance changes performance of the tes bolometer and creates non - linearity , which leads to systematic errors .",
    "we successfully reduced the series resistance using low - loss capacitors . to reduce it further",
    ", we will implement micro - d connectors , which have a low - contact resistance and are robust mechanically . though their disadvantage is a high inductance , we will use the lower - inductance stripline under development to compensate the increase in inductance .",
    "we have demonstrated tuning bolometers into transition at a high frequency using legacy warm electronics , which multiplexes up to 16 channels .",
    "new warm electronics allowing a larger multiplexing factor have been developed @xcite and we will test the cold readout with them .",
