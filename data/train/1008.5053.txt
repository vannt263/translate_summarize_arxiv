    "strongly frustrated low - dimensional magnets attracted much attention last years @xcite .",
    "a very interesting class of such compounds is edge - sharing chains where @xmath1 plaquets are coupled by their edges @xcite .",
    "an important feature of the edge - sharing chains is that the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) interaction @xmath2 between @xmath3 spins is ferromagnetic while the next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) interaction @xmath4 is antiferromagnetic .",
    "the competition between them leads to the frustration .",
    "a minimal model describing the magnetic properties of these cuprates is so - called f - af spin chain model the hamiltonian of which is @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the ground state phase diagram of the @xmath0 f - af model has been studied extensively last years @xcite .",
    "the ground state of this model is governed by the frustration parameter @xmath8 . at @xmath9",
    "the ground state is fully ferromagnetic . at @xmath10 the incommensurate singlet phase with short - range helical spin correlations is realized . at @xmath11",
    "the quantum phase transition occurs .",
    "remarkably , this transition point does not depend on a spin value , including the classical limit @xmath12 .",
    "however , the influence of the frustration on low temperature thermodynamics is less studied , especially in the vicinity of the ferromagnet - helimagnet transition point .",
    "it is of a particular importance to study this problem , because there are several edge - sharing cuprates with @xmath13 which are of special interest @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , at present the low - temperature thermodynamics of quantum @xmath0 model ( [ h ] ) at @xmath14 can be studied only either by using of numerical calculations of finite chains or by approximate methods . on the other hand , the classical version of model ( [ h ] )",
    "can be studied exactly at @xmath15 .",
    "it is expected that the main qualitative features of the quantum low - temperature thermodynamics can be reproduced correctly in the framework of the classical model . besides , the classical limit can be used as a starting point to study quantum effects . therefore , the study of classical model ( [ h ] ) is useful for the understanding of the low - temperature properties of the quantum f - af chains .    at zero temperature classical model ( [ h ] ) has magnetic long range - order ( lro ) for all values of @xmath16 : the ferromagnetic lro at @xmath17 and the helical - type lro with the wave number @xmath18 for @xmath10 .",
    "it should be noticed that both the time - reversal and the parity symmetries are broken in the helical ordered phase .",
    "the helical ordered state possesses a two - fold discrete chiral degeneracy ( in addition to the usual spin - rotational degeneracy ) corresponding to clockwise and counter - clockwise turn of spins .",
    "the chiral order parameter is defined by the chirality vector @xmath19 $ ] . at finite temperature",
    "the lro is destroyed by thermal fluctuations , the thermodynamic quantities have singular behavior at @xmath15 with the corresponding critical exponents depending on @xmath16 . in ref.@xcite",
    "we studied classical model ( [ h ] ) at @xmath20 , i.e. exactly at the ferromagnet - helimagnet transition point .",
    "it was shown that the correlation length @xmath21 behaves as @xmath22 and zero - field susceptibility @xmath23 diverges as @xmath24 in contrast with the 1d heisenberg ferromagnet ( hf ) ( @xmath25 ) where @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the low - temperature thermodynamics of the f - af classical model in the vicinity of the ferromagnet - helimagnet transition point .",
    "as it will be shown , in the low - temperature limit the thermodynamic quantities become the universal functions of the scaled temperature @xmath28 , where the parameter @xmath29 characterizes the deviation from the transition point and is assumed to be small .",
    "the calculation of the thermodynamic quantities in this limit reduces to the solution of the schrdinger equation for the quantum particle in an anharmonic potential .",
    "it is worth noting that the thermodynamics of classical spin model ( [ h ] ) has been studied before @xcite using the transfer - matrix method with the subsequent solution of the corresponding integral equations by gaussian integration formulas .",
    "this method gives reliable results for the moderate temperatures and values of @xmath30 .",
    "however , this procedure fails for low temperatures because of appearing of an artificial gap in the excitation spectrum @xcite . our approach gives exact asymptotics of the thermodynamic quantities at @xmath15 , @xmath31 and these results are complementary to those obtained in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the continuum version of the model is introduced .",
    "the problem of the calculation of the partition function is reduced to the solution of the schrdinger equation for a particle in the potential well . in section",
    "iii the spin correlation function is obtained and the @xmath32-dependence of the static structure factor is studied .",
    "it is shown that the low temperature thermodynamics is the universal function of the scaling variable .",
    "the phase diagram of the model is constructed and the location of the lifshitz point is determined .",
    "the behavior of the chiral correlation function is also studied . in section",
    "iv the summary of the obtained results is given and their relation to early studies of the considered model @xcite is discussed . in the appendix the derivation of the energy of chiral domain wall is given .",
    "in the vicinity of the transition point it is convenient to rewrite hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) in the form @xcite : @xmath33 \\label{h14}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 .    in eq.([h14 ] ) we put @xmath35 and omit unessential constant . in the classical approximation",
    "the spin operators @xmath36 are replaced by the classical unit vectors @xmath37 .",
    "we will investigate mainly the case @xmath38 corresponding to the helical side of the ground state phase diagram . in the limit",
    "@xmath15 the thermal fluctuations are weak and at @xmath39 the period of the helix is long , so that neighbor spins are directed almost parallel to each other .",
    "therefore , we can use the continuum approach replacing @xmath37 by the classical unit vector field @xmath40 with slowly varying orientations , so that @xmath41 and @xmath42 where the lattice constant is chosen as unit length .    using eqs.([c1 ] ) and ( [ c2 ] ) hamiltonian ( [ h14 ] ) goes over into the energy functional of the vector field @xmath43 : @xmath44   \\label{etr}\\ ] ]    this energy functional is a starting point of the investigations of model ( [ h ] ) in the vicinity of the transition point @xmath20 .",

    "since the integration in the partition function occurs over all possible spin configurations , we are free to choose any local coordinate system .",
    "it is convenient to choose it so that the @xmath51 axis at the point @xmath52 is directed along the spin vector @xmath53 , so that the spin vector @xmath54 .",
    "let us introduce a new vector field @xmath55    then , the constraint @xmath56 converts to the relations for @xmath57 : @xmath58 where the prime denotes the space derivative @xmath59 .",
    "then , the first term of the hamilton function in eq.([etr ] ) transforms to @xmath60    here we see that the constraint @xmath61 effectively eliminates the @xmath62 component from the hamilton function .",
    "therefore , henceforth we deal with the @xmath63 and @xmath64 components of the vector field @xmath65 only , and we denote a two - component vector field by @xmath66 .",
    "the partition function in terms of @xmath67 takes the form : @xmath68    if we replace @xmath52 by an imaginary time @xmath69 then partition function ( [ zq3d ] ) takes the form of a path integral of a quantum particle in a potential @xmath70 . in other words",
    "@xmath71 in eq.([zq3d ] ) is the partition function of the quantum system at ` temperature ' @xmath72 described by the hamiltonian @xmath73 where @xmath74 is two - dimensional laplace operator .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) commutes with the @xmath51-component of the angular momentum @xmath75 and eigenstates @xmath76 of the corresponding schrdinger equation are divided into subspaces of azimuthal quantum numbers @xmath77 @xmath78    thus , the wave function @xmath79 describes a particle with the azimuthal quantum number @xmath80 in the 2d axially symmetrical potential well @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) . obviously , the eigenfunctions and the eigenvalues of eq.([hpsi ] ) are real for all values of @xmath83 .",
    "the dependencies of several lowest eigenvalues of eq.([hpsi ] ) on model parameter @xmath84 are shown in fig.[fige ] . for large",
    "@xmath83 the potential @xmath85 takes the form of the mexican hat with a deep and steep axially symmetrical well @xmath86 . in this case",
    "the spectrum becomes almost degenerate over angular momentum @xmath80 , which is in accord with fig.[fige ] . in the limit @xmath87 the asymptotic of eigenvalues of eq.([hpsi ] ) can be found explicitly : @xmath88    the partition function is a sum of exponents over all states and in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath89 ) only the lowest eigenvalue @xmath90 with @xmath91 gives contribution to the partition function : @xmath92",
    "the calculation of the correlation function @xmath93 is more complicated procedure in comparison with that for the partition function .",
    "it is considered in detail for the case @xmath20 ( @xmath94 ) in ref.@xcite , where the problem of the calculation of the correlation functions reduces to solution of the additional differential equations together with eq.([hpsi ] ) .",
    "this procedure can be extended to the case @xmath95 straightforwardly .",
    "in particular , the expressions for the correlation function remains exactly the same as for the case @xmath20 and only the form of the potential well in the corresponding pair of differential equations is modified , @xmath96 instead of @xmath97 .",
    "the differential equations are @xmath98    eqs.([ode2 ] ) represent the eigenvalue problem for @xmath99 and eigenfunctions @xmath100 and @xmath101 satisfying the normalization conditions : @xmath102    system of equations ( [ ode2 ] ) describes a two - level system in the axially symmetric potential well @xmath96 , where two levels with angular momenta @xmath103 and @xmath104 are coupled by non - hermitian transition operator .",
    "as shown in ref.@xcite the spin correlation function has a form @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath90 are the ground state wave function and the ground state energy of the schrdinger equation ( [ hpsi ] ) and @xmath107 and @xmath99 are the eigenfunctions and the eigenvalues of eqs.([ode2 ] ) .    the numerical solution of eqs.([ode2 ] )",
    "demonstrates the following properties . for small @xmath84",
    "all eigenvalues of eq.([ode2 ] ) are real but the eigenfunctions of eq.([ode2 ] ) are complex . with the increase of @xmath84",
    ", two lowest levels @xmath108 approach to each other , then at @xmath109 they coincide and after that , for @xmath110 , these eigenvalues become complex conjugated . their imaginary part increases as @xmath111 .",
    "these features of the solutions of eqs.([ode2 ] ) are illustrated in fig.[figeta ] , where the dependencies of the eigenvalues @xmath108 on parameter @xmath84 are shown . according to eq.([cor ] )",
    "the appearance of imaginary parts of eigenvalues @xmath99 implies that the correlation function begins to oscillate .    with the further increase of @xmath84 the next two levels @xmath112 approach to each other and at some value",
    "@xmath113 become complex conjugated . and",
    "so on , so that at large values of @xmath84 all low - lying levels are divided on complex conjugated pairs .",
    "the corresponding eigenfunctions of these pairs are complex conjugated as well .",
    "this fact guarantees the reality of the correlation function .",
    "it is important that all the eigenvalues @xmath90 , @xmath99 and the eigenfunctions @xmath106 , @xmath107 presented in eq.([cor ] ) depend on the parameter @xmath84 only .",
    "this means that the correlation function and other related physical quantities are universal functions of the scaling parameter @xmath84 .    in what follows it",
    "is convenient to consider the system properties as functions of the scaling parameter @xmath114 , which represents the normalized temperature @xmath115 .",
    "as shown in the appendix the excitation energy @xmath116 of a chiral domain wall , which separates two domains with different chirality vector , is proportional to @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath118 is nothing but the ratio ( up to numerical factor ) @xmath119 and the physical meaning of the scaling variable @xmath118 is the normalization of the temperature by the energy of the chiral domain wall .    according to eq.([cor ] )",
    "the static structure factor is @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the scaled momentum . as follows from eq.([sk2d ] ) , the structure factor is scaled as @xmath22 and , therefore , @xmath122 is the universal function of @xmath118 .",
    "the susceptibility @xmath123 is connected with the static structure factor by the relation @xmath124 . at first",
    ", we consider the temperature dependence of the uniform susceptibility @xmath125 . according to eq.([sk2d ] )",
    "it is @xmath126    since the eigenfunctions and the eigenvalues of eqs.([hpsi ] ) and ( [ ode2 ] ) are functions of a single variable @xmath118 , the normalized susceptibility @xmath127 can be expressed as an universal function of the normalized temperature @xmath118 .",
    "thus , @xmath128 reveals the scaling behavior : in the vicinity of the transition point and at @xmath15 the dependence of @xmath128 on the temperature and the model parameter @xmath129 enters only in the combination @xmath130 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath128 on @xmath118 is shown in fig.[figchi ] .",
    "the characteristic features of this dependence are the existence of maximum of @xmath128 at @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) and the finite value of @xmath128 at @xmath133 .",
    "the latter fact is a pure classical effect . in the @xmath0 quantum f - af model the ground state",
    "is believed to be gapped ( though the gap can be extremely small @xcite ) , and so @xmath134 as @xmath15 .",
    "the obtained dependence @xmath135 means that for a given model parameter @xmath30 the uniform susceptibility has the maximum at temperature @xmath136 and the height of this maximum is @xmath137 .",
    "this implies that with the increase of @xmath30 the maximum of @xmath138 shifts to higher temperatures and the magnitude of the maximum @xmath139 decreases .",
    "let us consider the behavior of the static structure factor ( [ sk2d ] ) as a function of @xmath32 .",
    "some examples of @xmath140 are shown in fig.[figsk ] .",
    "as we see , the static structure factor has a pronounced maximum and its location depends on @xmath118 . in the vicinity of the maximum @xmath140 can be represented as @xmath141    therefore , the behavior of the static structure factor is described by three parameters : the location of the maximum @xmath142 , the magnitude of the maximum @xmath143 , and the correlation length @xmath21 characterizing the width of the maximum : @xmath144    obviously , the correlation length is scaled as the space variable ( [ xi ] ) and , therefore , the normalized correlation length @xmath145 is the universal function of @xmath118 .",
    "the location of the maximum @xmath142 is determined by the condition @xmath146 . according to eq.([sk2d ] )",
    "this condition reduces to the equation @xmath147^{2}}=0 \\label{eqkm}\\ ] ]    this equation determines the scaled momentum @xmath148 as a function of @xmath118 .",
    "obviously , eq.([eqkm ] ) always has a trivial solution @xmath149 . for high values of @xmath118",
    "there are no other solutions .",
    "however , at some value of the scaled temperature @xmath150 another , non - trivial solution of eq.([eqkm ] ) with @xmath151 appears . for @xmath152 the maximum of the structure factor shifts from @xmath149 .",
    "thus , @xmath150 defines the lifshitz point which corresponds to the transition from the helical to the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "certainly , there is no true helical or ferromagnetic lro in these phases , because thermal fluctuations destroy any lro in one - dimensional systems .",
    "therefore , under the helical and the ferromagnetic phases we mean the presence of the short - range order ( sro ) of the corresponding type .    the location of the lifshitz point is determined by the equation : @xmath153    the numerical solution of eq.([eqlifschitz ] ) gives @xmath154 .",
    "thus , the transition line between the ferromagnetic and the helical phases ( ` lifshitz boundary ' ) in ( @xmath155 ) plane has a form @xmath156    the corresponding phase diagram is shown in fig.[figphase ] .    for a fixed model parameter @xmath157 the dependence of the system properties on the temperature",
    "can be qualitatively described in the following way . at @xmath133",
    "the structure factor @xmath140 has a @xmath158-function form at the corresponding wave vectors @xmath159 , indicating the helical lro . at low temperatures ( @xmath160 )",
    "the @xmath158-peaks are smeared by gapless excitations ( spin waves ) over the helical ground states .",
    "the chiral domain wall excitations have the gap ( @xmath161 ) and their contribution to the thermodynamics is exponentially small .",
    "the analysis of eq.([sk2d ] ) shows that in this region ( @xmath160 ) the magnitude of the maximum and the correlation length behave as @xmath162 .",
    "when the temperature is increased , the maximum of @xmath140 shifts to @xmath163 and at approaching to the lifshitz point the value of @xmath142 tends to zero by the square root law @xmath164 .",
    "this is similar to the order parameter behavior in landau theory of second - order phase transitions .",
    "indeed , in the three - dimensional frustrated classical spin model , when the helical lro exists , the wave vector associated with the helical phase vanishes by the same law @xcite .",
    "the numerically obtained dependencies of @xmath165 and the scaled correlation length @xmath166 on @xmath118 are demonstrated in fig.[figkmax ] and fig.[figlc ] , correspondingly .",
    "as shown in fig.[figlc ] the correlation length vanishes at @xmath150 , because @xmath140 does not contain @xmath167 term in @xmath32 expansion at the lifshitz point .",
    "the magnitude of the maximum at the lifshitz point is @xmath168 .",
    "for @xmath169 the helical correlations are destroyed , the maximum of @xmath140 is situated at @xmath170 and in the limit @xmath171 it tends to the results obtained in ref.@xcite : @xmath172 and @xmath173 .    up to now we considered the classical spin model where @xmath174 is usual three - component classical vector .",
    "it is appropriate to discuss briefly the planar model describing by hamiltonian ( [ h14 ] ) , where the vector @xmath175 has two components ( planar spin model ) . for short",
    "we denote below these two models as @xmath176 and @xmath177 cases . just as for the @xmath176 model the transition point between the ferromagnetic and the helical ground states for the @xmath177 model takes place at @xmath20 .",
    "the low - temperature thermodynamics of the @xmath177 model near the transition point can be analyzed in a similar manner as for the @xmath176 case .",
    "in particular , the calculation of the partition function for the @xmath177 model reduces to the solution of the schrdinger equation @xmath178 where @xmath81 .",
    "our study of the planar model shows that the thermodynamic quantities are the universal functions of the same scaling parameter @xmath115 .",
    "the behaviors of @xmath140 , @xmath179 and @xmath180 are similar to that for @xmath181 case .",
    "the lifshitz point is determined by @xmath182 and the critical exponent characterizing the behavior of @xmath142 near @xmath183 is @xmath184 as well .",
    "however , the behavior of the chiral correlation function @xmath185 of these two models are different . in the continuum approach the chiral vector is expressed as @xmath186    in the @xmath187 model the chiral vector is directed perpendicular to the spin plane for any @xmath188 .",
    "therefore in this case @xmath189    in the @xmath181 model we take into account local coordinates with @xmath190 and @xmath191 and obtain similar expression @xmath192    the expression for the chiral correlation function @xmath193 can be obtained in the same manner as for the spin correlation function : @xmath194    here @xmath195 and @xmath196 are the eigenfunctions and the eigenvalues of the schrdinger equations ( [ hpsi ] ) . for planar case",
    "@xmath193 has similar expression where @xmath195 and @xmath196 are solutions of eq.([schr ] ) .",
    "since @xmath195 and @xmath196 are always real , the chiral correlation function @xmath193 does not oscillate and the maximum of the corresponding structure factor is at @xmath163 for both @xmath187 and @xmath181 cases .    as follows from eq.([r ] ) the correlation length of the chirality @xmath197 is scaled as @xmath198 and at @xmath15 it is defined by the lowest level having the non - zero matrix element with the ground - state wave function @xmath106 .",
    "so , for normalized chiral correlation length @xmath199 we have @xmath200    the ground state wave function for eq.([schr ] ) is an even function of @xmath201 and only the eigenfunctions with odd parity give contributions to @xmath193 .",
    "so , for the @xmath187 model @xmath202 is the energy of the first excited state of the odd parity .",
    "for the @xmath181 model the matrix elements in eq.([r ] ) are non - zero only for the wave functions @xmath195 with @xmath104 . at the transition point",
    "( corresponding to the limit @xmath203 ) the energy difference @xmath204 is finite for both @xmath187 ( @xmath205 ) and @xmath181 ( @xmath206 ) cases .    at @xmath207",
    "the behavior of the energy gap between two lowest levels for @xmath187 and @xmath181 models becomes qualitatively different . for the @xmath187 case",
    "the potential @xmath208 has two degenerate minima and the splitting of two lowest levels @xmath204 depends upon tunneling through the classically forbidden region of small @xmath201 .",
    "this tunneling is exponentially small for low temperatures and the wkb estimate gives @xmath209 .",
    "however , for the @xmath181 case the particle moves in two - dimensional axially symmetric potential , the form of the mexican hat , and relevant splitting is equal to the additional energy associated with one unit of the angular momentum .",
    "then , according to eq.([epsilon ] ) @xmath210 .",
    "thus , the behavior of the correlation length of the chirality is essentially different for these two models .",
    "so far we studied the helical side of the transition point @xmath10 ( @xmath211 ) .",
    "on the ferromagnetic side ( @xmath212 ) the static structure factor @xmath140 and the susceptibility @xmath123 have the maximum at @xmath163 for any temperature .",
    "the uniform susceptibility @xmath138 diverges at @xmath15 but the corresponding exponent changes from @xmath213 to @xmath214 and eq.([chi0 ] ) describes this crossover .",
    "the exponent @xmath214 appears in the limit @xmath215 , when @xmath216 and the susceptibility becomes @xmath217 , which is in accord with the result for hf with the coupling constant @xmath218 .",
    "indeed , in the limit @xmath219 one can neglect the second derivative term in energy functional ( [ etr ] ) and the model reduces to the hf with renormalized coupling @xmath218 .",
    "we have studied the low - temperature thermodynamics of the classical f - af model in the vicinity of the ferromagnet - helimagnet transition point with use of the continuum approximation .",
    "the calculation of the partition and the spin correlation functions is reduced to a quantum mechanical problem of a particle in a potential well .",
    "it is shown that the thermodynamic quantities are universal functions of the scaling variable @xmath115 , where @xmath220 describes the deviation from the transition point .    on the ferromagnetic side ( @xmath212 )",
    "the static structure factor @xmath140 has the maximum at @xmath163 for all temperatures . the uniform susceptibility @xmath138 diverges at @xmath15 but the corresponding asymptotics changes from @xmath221 at the transition point to @xmath222 for @xmath223 .",
    "the crossover between these regimes takes place at @xmath224 .    on the helical side of the transition point ( @xmath225 ) our investigation displays the following dependence of the system properties on the temperature . at zero temperature",
    "the static structure factor @xmath140 has a @xmath226-function form at the corresponding wave vectors @xmath159 , indicating the lro of the helical - type . at finite temperatures",
    "the lro is destroyed by thermal fluctuations , which is manifested in smearing of @xmath226-peaks of the static structure factor by gapless excitations ( spin waves ) over the helical ground states .",
    "the chiral domain wall excitations have the gap ( @xmath117 ) and their contribution to the thermodynamics is exponentially small for low temperatures @xmath227 . in this region",
    "the magnitude of the maximum of the structure factor and the correlation length behave as @xmath228 .",
    "further increase of the temperature is accompanied by the damping of the peak and its shift to @xmath163 . at approaching to the lifshitz point",
    "@xmath229 the value of @xmath142 tends to zero by the square root law @xmath230 .",
    "such dependence is similar to the order parameter behavior in the landau theory of the second - order phase transitions .",
    "so , the location of the peak @xmath142 plays a role of the order parameter , though one should remember that the system has only the short - range helical order at finite temperatures .",
    "equation @xmath231 determines the lifshitz boundary in ( @xmath155 ) plane , separating the ferromagnetic and the helical phases .",
    "for @xmath232 the helical correlations are destroyed by the chiral domain wall excitations and the maximum of the static structure factor @xmath140 is situated at @xmath170 .",
    "the high temperature limit @xmath233 is equivalent to the limit @xmath234 .",
    "this implies that one can neglect the second terms in eqs.([h14 ] ) and ( [ etr ] ) and the model effectively reduces to that at the transition point studied in ref.@xcite . here",
    "the uniform susceptibility and the correlation length are @xmath235 and @xmath173 .",
    "we should remind that our analysis is restricted by low temperatures and , therefore , the latter high-@xmath236 limit is in fact restricted by @xmath237 .    the uniform susceptibility @xmath138 has the maximum at @xmath136 and @xmath238 ,",
    "i.e. with the increase of the frustration parameter @xmath239 the maximum of @xmath138 shifts to higher temperatures and the magnitude of the maximum @xmath139 decreases .",
    "the obtained dependence of @xmath138 on @xmath236 is in a qualitative agreement with those observed in the edge - shared compounds with @xmath239 close to @xmath240 ( @xmath241 @xcite , @xmath242 @xcite , @xmath243 @xcite ) .",
    "the dependencies of @xmath244 and @xmath139 on the frustration parameter @xmath239 are also in accord with the experimental observations @xcite .    we have also shown that the thermodynamic behavior of both planar and classical f - af models are similar . the exception is the chiral correlation function .",
    "the chiral correlation length of the planar model increases exponentially at @xmath15 in contrast with the power dependence for the classical @xmath181 model .",
    "this fact is explained by different topology of the potentials in the corresponding schrdinger equations .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results with those obtained in refs.@xcite for intermediate values of @xmath236 and @xmath30 .",
    "in contrast with the phase diagram obtained for small values of @xmath236 and @xmath30 and schematically shown in fig.6 , the lifshitz boundary for intermediate values of @xmath236 and @xmath30 can have the reentrant behavior @xcite . there is a critical value of @xmath245 ( for the planar model @xmath246 @xcite ) , where the lifshitz boundary turns round and moves back to @xmath247 with the further increase of temperature .",
    "this means that for a fixed small value of @xmath30 ( @xmath248 ) the ferromagnetic phase exists in the finite range of temperatures and for @xmath249 the helical - type correlations remain for all temperatures .",
    "this fact testifies that in the region of intermediate or large values of @xmath236 and @xmath30 , where the continuum approximation becomes unapplicable , the thermodynamic behavior can be qualitatively different from the results presented here for small @xmath236 and @xmath30 .      in the appendix",
    "we calculate the chiral domain wall energy for the classical spin model described by energy functional ( [ etr ] ) .",
    "to study excitations in this model it is useful to make the following rescaling of the space variable @xmath250 .",
    "then , energy functional ( [ etr ] ) takes the form : @xmath251 \\label{esxi}\\ ] ]    here we see that the integrand in eq.([esxi ] ) does not contain any parameter and , therefore , any localized excitation is proportional to @xmath252 .",
    "certainly , the determination of the numerical factor before @xmath253 needs the solution of the corresponding euler equation .",
    "these euler equations are highly non - linear and its complete analysis is hardly possible .",
    "fortunately , such an analysis is possible for the planar spin case .",
    "the solutions for the planar spin case represent particular cases of solutions for the original three - component spin model .        here",
    "we see that the euler equation has a trivial helical solution @xmath259 with any constants @xmath260 and @xmath261 .",
    "however , the minimum of energy ( [ exi ] ) corresponding to the ground state is achieved by a definite helical configuration with @xmath262 and the ground state energy is @xmath263    to find the excitations over the helical ground state we should look for other solutions of eq.([euler ] ) .",
    "eq.([euler ] ) can be integrated so that for @xmath264 we obtain equation @xmath265 with some integration constants @xmath266 and @xmath267 .",
    "the right - hand side of eq.([ode ] ) has a double - well form .",
    "the complete analysis of solutions of eq.([ode ] ) will be given elsewhere .",
    "here we present the solution describing the chiral domain wall only .",
    "this case corresponds to the choice of integration constants @xmath270 and @xmath271 . in this case",
    "the solution of eq.([ode ] ) has a simple form @xmath272 or in original terms for angle @xmath273 @xmath274\\ ] ] with arbitrary @xmath275 and @xmath276 .",
    "as can be seen , this solution describes a chiral domain wall separating two domains of opposite chirality .",
    "the energy of this excitation is @xmath277    in case of three - component spin vectors the chiral domain wall excitations are more complicated .",
    "they depend on the boundary conditions on @xmath278 , which can be imposed on the chiral vectors @xmath279 . in the helical ground state",
    "the length of the chiral vectors equals @xmath280 , but the direction is arbitrary according to degeneracy of the helical ground state .",
    "therefore , the chiral domain wall solution is a function of the angle between the chiral vectors at @xmath278 : @xmath281    in the planar spin case considered above the angle @xmath282 is @xmath283 , because chiral vectors are antiparallel on @xmath284 .",
    "it is also obvious that the limit @xmath285 corresponds to the ground state configuration .",
    "in general the dependence of the energy of the chiral domain wall on the angle @xmath282 is unknown , but it is natural to assume that this function monotonically increases from zero at @xmath286 to the exact result eq.([ekink ] ) at @xmath283 .",
    "therefore , in any case the energy of the chiral domain wall is proportional to @xmath252 and can be written as @xmath287 with some smooth monotonic function @xmath288 having the limits @xmath289 and @xmath290 .",
