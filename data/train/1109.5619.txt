    "@xcite . from the definition of cut on @xmath23 , for small @xmath1 we have @xmath90 . from figure  [ fig : numerics2 ] one can see that for small @xmath1 the cut on @xmath23 is the only one that affects the splitting intensity , since all three types of cuts on @xmath91 give practically identical results .",
    "as far as the intermediate @xmath1 region is concerned , the cut on @xmath23 does not play a significant role since from the definition @xmath92 , thus the observable difference must be attributed to the cut on @xmath84 for this region .",
    "the kinematic cut on @xmath84 , however , can lead to a factor of 2 variation of the in - medium parton splitting intensities at intermediate @xmath1 . note that for intermediate @xmath1 the third cut on @xmath84 , which corresponds to full kinematics but retains the @xmath93 dependence of the scattering cross section  eq .",
    ", agrees perfectly with the uncut solid red curve . in this case , cuts alone ( in the sense of full kinematics ) do not affect significantly the in - medium branching processes .",
    "we find that what affects the splitting intensity is the deviation between the exact scattering cross section from  @xcite and the approximate power - law form in  eq .  .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : numerics2 ] by the solid black curve that pushes the intensity of the medium - induced branching processes down when compared to the dot - dashed black curve .",
    "we finally note that if one wishes to simplify the calculation and use the approximate form  eq .   for in - medium parton scattering",
    "the most adequate transverse momentum cut would be @xmath94 . finally , for @xmath95",
    ", we find that @xmath96 , and all the splitting intensities with phase space cuts turn over at large enough @xmath1 , which is not visible in figure [ fig : numerics2 ] because we do not plot values of @xmath1 very close to 1 .    numerically ,",
    "all effects : finite @xmath1 , phase space cuts , recoil effect are of the same order at high energies .",
    "in addition , we observe that parton recoil , similar to finite @xmath1 corrections appears at intermediate @xmath1 , while phase space cuts play role both for small @xmath1 and intermediate @xmath1 .",
    "in this letter we derived the medium - induced parton splittings for quarks and gluons produced in large @xmath0 scattering processes that subsequently traverse a region of dense qcd matter and undergo final - state interactions using a recently constructed effective theory @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "our results include both the contributions from the in - medium parton scattering and their dominant interference with the vacuum - like branching processes  @xcite .",
    "these formulas are valid for an arbitrary splitting parameter @xmath1 and include all leading terms consistent with the power counting of @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "our results for the @xmath97 , including landau - pomeranchuck - migdal coherence and interference effects , are presented in eq .",
    "-eq .   and",
    "are the main new findings reported in this letter .",
    "we verified in eq .",
    "that in the small-@xmath1 approximation our formulas simplify considerably and reduce to the soft gluon emission results of the gyulassy - levai - vitev approach to inelastic parton interactions in dense qcd matter  @xcite . in this case , to leading power in @xmath98 , only two medium - induced splitting kernels survive that do not change the flavor of the leading parton and have a natural interpretation in terms of parton energy loss .    neglecting the recoil of the partons in the qcd medium and ignoring the phase space cuts , we derived fully analytic formulas for the in - medium splitting intensity , given in eq .",
    "we see the main utility of these formulas as a convenient cross check for the numerical simulations , which we have demonstrated in this letter .",
    "our full results provide a basis for further improvements in the jet quenching phenomenology  @xcite-@xcite by including the following effects : @xmath99 finite @xmath1 corrections in the @xmath3 and @xmath32 splittings , consistent with the power counting of , @xmath100 new splittings for @xmath101 , @xmath5 from coherent final - state interactions , @xmath102 exact parton recoil kinematics and , @xmath103 exact phase space cuts .",
    "all of the above effects can be of the same order , as one can see from our numerical simulation results in section  [ numericssec ] .",
    "this program of improving the theoretical accuracy of jet quenching simulations is especially interesting in light of recent rhic and lhc heavy ion results  @xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite and we plan to show first phenomenological applications in the near future .",
