    "+ concerning the thermodynamical stability , the specific heat at constant angular momentum and the isothermal moment of inertia were considered .",
    "both quantities have to be positive at the same time to ensure thermodynamical stability , but neither the charged dilatonic black ring nor the charged dilatonic black saturn are thermodynamically stable .",
    "note that the neutral black ring and black saturn are also not thermodynamically stable @xcite . + for future work it would be interesting to construct charged dilatonic black rings and black saturns with arbitrary values of the dilaton coupling contant , including the pure einstein - maxwell case , where the coupling constant vanishes .",
    "subsequently , one would investigate their thermodynamic stability .",
    "+ since currently no analytical methods are available to obtain such more general charged solutions in closed form , one might resort to a combination of perturbative methods and numerical methods , to obtain a rather complete picture for such solutions . in the thin ring limit , where one has widely separate scales in the problem",
    ", the blackfold approach represents an excellent approximate method to study the properties of such solutions in five and more dimensions @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the blackfold construction correctly reproduces all physical properties of the rotating charged dilatonic black ring .",
    "interestingly the blackfold construction of a charged black ring also agrees very well with the charged black saturn in the ultraspinning limit . in a way this was expected since as @xmath75 is increased more mass is carried by the ring part of the black saturn and less by the central black hole , so that the @xmath72-@xmath75-curve of the black saturn asymptotes the black ring curve in the phase diagram .",
    "figure [ pic : blackfold ] shows a comparison of the blackfold approximation of the charged black ring with the analytic solution of the charged black ring and black saturn .",
    "the different ( scaled ) terms of the smarr formula are plotted against the scaled charge @xmath156 .",
    "+ in constrast , when the scales involved make the blackfold approach inappropriate , such as in the fat black ring regime , numerical methods can yield important new insights into the phase diagram of such higher dimensional black objects @xcite .",
    "i would like to thank jutta kunz , niels obers and eugen radu for helpful discussions , and also gratefully acknowledge support by the dfg , in particular , within the dfg research training group 1620 `` models of gravity '' .",
