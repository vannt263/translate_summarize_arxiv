    "<S> the upper critical field @xmath0 of tl@xmath1rb@xmath2fe@xmath3se@xmath4 single crystals has been determined by means of measuring the electrical resistivity in both a pulsed magnetic field ( @xmath558 t ) and a dc magnetic field ( @xmath514 t ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that @xmath6 linearly increases with decreasing temperature for @xmath7@xmath8@xmath9 , reaching @xmath10 t. on the other hand , a larger @xmath11 with a strong convex curvature is observed for @xmath7@xmath12@xmath9 ( @xmath13(18k)@xmath1460 t ) . </S>",
    "<S> this compound shows a moderate anisotropy of the upper critical field around @xmath15 , which decreases with decreasing temperature . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the upper critical field based on the werthamer - helfand - hohenberg ( whh ) method indicates that @xmath11 is orbitally limited for @xmath7@xmath8@xmath9 , but the effect of spin paramagnetism may play an important role on the pair breaking for @xmath7@xmath12@xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> all these experimental observations remarkably resemble those of the iron pnictide superconductors , suggesting a universal scenario for the iron - based superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the superconducting transition is significantly broadened upon applying a magnetic field , indicating strong thermal fluctuation effects in the superconducting state of tl@xmath1rb@xmath2fe@xmath3se@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the derived thermal activation energy for vortex motion is compatible with those of the 1111-type iron pnictides . </S>"
