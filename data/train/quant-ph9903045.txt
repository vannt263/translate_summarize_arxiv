    "study of multidimensional and multi - particle objects is qualitatively more complicated than that of the one - dimensional case .",
    "when there is no symmetry in the potentials of interaction between particles , these systems are described by partial differential equations with unseparable variables . just for this reason the inverse scattering problem in 2- and 3-dimensional spaces was formulated by faddeev @xcite and newton @xcite , novikov and henkin @xcite at a much later than the 1-dimensional problem .",
    "the foundation for developing the 2-dimensional inverse problem in finite differences was laid by berezanskii @xcite who developed the theory of orthogonal polynomials for the jacobi infinite matrix .",
    "the darboux transformations in quantum mechanics for the schrdinger differential and difference 1-dimensional equation have much in common with the spectral transformations for orthogonal polynomials @xcite .",
    "it is therefore expedient to analyze the spectral inverse problem for the discrete 2-dimensional schrdinger equation on the basis of the technique of orthogonalization of polynomials .",
    "the formulae of the inverse problem with degenerate kernels are closely related to bargmann - darboux transformations @xcite@xcite .",
    "the one - dimensional darboux transformations has already found wide applications in quantum mechanics and in the theory of nonlinear integrable systems @xcite .    in the present paper , a discrete version of the gelfand - levitan inverse spectral problem",
    "is considered for the two - dimensional lattice schrdinger equation .",
    "the two - dimensional finite - difference inverse problem , based on the procedure of orthogonalization of polynomial vectors , is a generalization of the one - dimensional procedure given in @xcite . on the basis of the obtained formulae of the inverse problem ,",
    "the relations are derived for discrete bargmann - darboux transformations in two dimensions .",
    "the suggested algebraic approach allows one to construct families of discrete potentials in an explicit form and the corresponding solutions .",
    "consider the schrdinger equation whose hamiltonian is tridiagonal in a certain basis with respect to both the coordinate variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xmath2 the coefficients @xmath3 are assumed to be real and represent discrete potentials ; @xmath4 are discrete wave functions , @xmath5 is an integer point of the half - plane , @xmath6 , @xmath7 is a spectral parameter . the index @xmath0 can vary from @xmath8 to @xmath9 and the index @xmath1 can vary from @xmath10 to @xmath9 or from @xmath8 to @xmath9 ; when @xmath11 and @xmath12 , it is a special class of restricted problems .",
    "the equation in finite differences ( [ 1.1 ] ) can be represented by the expression with operator coefficients @xmath13 when we treat one of the variables , @xmath0 , as the only discrete coordinate ; and the other , @xmath1 , as the channel index .",
    "if we set @xmath14 , the action of the schrdinger discrete operator @xmath15 on the vector @xmath16 is represented by the action of the jacobi block matrix @xmath17 on @xmath18 @xmath19 whose elements @xmath20 and @xmath21 are matrices at each fixed @xmath0 , and each element @xmath22 of the vector @xmath18 corresponds to the vector @xmath23 , in the other space variable @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 it is clear that the operator @xmath15 is hermitian . note that the coupling of equations ( [ 1.1 ] ) or ( [ 1.2 ] ) with respect to @xmath1 occurs only between immediate neighbours and for this reason the symmetric coupling matrix @xmath27 in ( [ 1.2 ] ) is tridiagonal and relates the functions @xmath4 at @xmath28 , unlike the conventional multichannel case .    from the jacobi block matrix ( [ 1.j ] )",
    "tridiagonal in the variable @xmath0 it is seen that every vector of the solutions @xmath22 is connected with the vectors of solutions @xmath29 at the neighboring points @xmath30 . as a result ,",
    "if we take nonhomogeneous boundary conditions at one end of the interval @xmath31 , we can obtain the solutions on the whole interval by moving by subsequent steps from that end .",
    "it turns out that these vectors of solutions as functions of the spectral parameter @xmath32 are polynomials of @xmath32 with matrix coefficients @xcite which can be orthogonalized in the spectral measure .",
    "the spectral inverse problem is reduced to the construction of potential matrices @xmath20 , @xmath21 and an unknown system of orthonormal polynomials with the use of the known system of orthonormal polynomials corresponding to the finite - difference equation ( [ 1.2 ] ) but with the known matrices @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "introduce auxiliary solutions @xmath35 and @xmath36 to eq.([1.1 ] ) with the help of the boundary conditions @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a point on the @xmath1 axis .",
    "the solutions @xmath39 satisfy the same equation ( [ 1.1 ] ) with the known potentials @xmath40",
    "@xmath41 @xmath42 as a first boundary condition , we can change the zeroth condition to a more general one corresponding to the homogeneous boundary conditions @xmath43 . in what follows",
    "we assume the step of finite - difference differentiation @xmath44 to equal 1 . according to the conditions ( [ 1.3 ] ) ,",
    "the functions @xmath45 and @xmath36 are equal to zero on the lines @xmath46 , @xmath47 except for the points with @xmath48 on the line @xmath49 where @xmath50 . from these values of @xmath51 and @xmath52",
    "one can find the functions @xmath45 and @xmath36 at all other points of the coordinate network by using the recurrence equation ( [ 1.1 ] ) . since the matrix equation ( [ 1.2 ] )",
    "is tridiagonal in the variable @xmath0 , and owing to the boundary conditions ( [ 1.3 ] ) , the vectors @xmath53 of solutions",
    "@xmath54 in the spectral variable @xmath7 are polynomials of the @xmath0th degree . at @xmath55",
    "the vector @xmath56 is a polynomial of the first degree ; at @xmath57 , the vector @xmath58 is a polynomial in @xmath7 of the second degree , and so on .",
    "it appears , however , that different elements @xmath59 of the vector of solutions @xmath60 have different degrees of polynomials . because of the three - point coupling with respect to @xmath1 the functions @xmath59 are polynomials in @xmath32 of the degree @xmath61 .",
    "the maximum @xmath0th degree belongs to the elements with @xmath48 and the elements @xmath62 vanish at all @xmath38 lying out of the values @xmath63 .",
    "the distribution of polynomial degrees is shown in fig.1 .",
    "+ @xmath64 and similarly for @xmath65 @xmath66 the spectral matrix elements @xmath67 ( or @xmath68 ) are determined by the boundary values of the special solutions @xmath4 ( or @xmath69 obeying the zeroth condition @xmath70 @xmath71 .",
    "for example , for @xmath72 states of the discrete spectrum , the matrix @xmath73 is the sum of @xmath72 terms formed from productions of the column vectors @xmath74 and the row vectors @xmath75 @xmath76 where the elements @xmath77 are defined by @xmath78 and @xmath79 is the heaviside step function equal to 1 at @xmath80 and to zero when @xmath81 .",
    "a solution @xmath4 to eq.([1.1 ] ) with the zeroth condition ( or a more general homogeneous condition ) where both of them exist when one of the boundary conditions is the same .",

    "we construct unknown polynomial solutions @xmath86 normalized with the spectral weight @xmath87 as a linear combination of the known polynomial solutions @xmath65 , orthogonal with respect to the measure @xmath88 @xmath89 as one can see above , the validity of this relation is a consequence of the fact that both the functions , @xmath65 and @xmath86 , obey the same discrete schrdinger equation ( [ 1.1 ] ) and the same boundary conditions ( [ 1.3 ] ) , given on the lines @xmath90 and @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , the solutions @xmath86 and @xmath65 are polynomials in @xmath7 of the same degree @xmath61 , but with different coefficients .",
    "the matrix of the polynomial solutions @xmath82 , which is of degree @xmath0 , is orthogonal to every polynomial matrix of degree lower than @xmath0 and hence to every @xmath91 for @xmath92 @xmath93    equation ( [ 1.4 ] ) is a discrete analog of the volterra integral equation , in which the coefficients @xmath94 are determined by the condition of orthogonality of the vector - functions @xmath95 orthogonal with the spectral measure @xmath73 to the functions @xmath91 orthogonal with the weight matrix @xmath96 , when @xmath97 @xmath98 the volterra equations ( [ 1.4 ] ) have a triangular form , @xmath99 for @xmath100 .",
    "it is easy to see from ( [ 1.4 ] ) and orthogonality of @xmath101 ( [ 1.7 ] ) that for @xmath102 @xmath103    inserting ( [ 1.4 ] ) into ( [ 1.6a ] ) for @xmath104 we obtain the following system of equations for the orthogonalization coefficients @xmath94 @xmath105 where @xmath106 equation ( [ gl ] ) is a two - dimensional analog of the gelfand - levitan integral equations for finite - difference equation ( [ 1.1 ] ) . however ,",
    "this system is not sufficient to determine the coefficients @xmath107 .",
    "a supplementary system of equations is obtained upon substituting ( [ 1.4 ] ) into the complete relation ( [ 1.6 ] ) at @xmath108 and @xmath109 @xmath110 now let us find connections between the potential coefficients and orthogonalization coefficients @xmath94 .",
    "to this end , we insert expression ( [ 1.4 ] ) for the polynomial functions @xmath86 in terms of @xmath65 into the schrdinger difference equation ( [ 1.1 ] ) @xmath111 we transform the r.h.s . of the above relation by means of the substitution of @xmath112 from the finite difference equation ( [ 1.1a ] ) for @xmath65 with the known potentials",
    "@xmath113 , @xmath114 @xmath115 further , we take advantage of the orthogonality relation ( [ 1.7 ] ) for the matrix functions @xmath116 orthogonal with the weight matrix @xmath96 . multiplying expression ( [ 1.8 ] ) with its transformed r.h.s .",
    "( [ 1.8a ] ) by @xmath117 , integrating over @xmath118 , and summing up over the indices @xmath38 and @xmath119 , we arrive at the relationship between the potentials @xmath120 and the coefficients @xmath121 @xmath122 the relations for the coefficients @xmath123 and @xmath124 are established in a similar manner . to determine @xmath125 , eq.([1.8 ] )",

    "the two - dimensional finite - difference inverse problem under consideration is also a generalization of that @xcite with the potential coefficients @xmath134 , @xmath135 , connected nevertheless in a special way .    in principle",
    ", it is easy to formulate the problem of restoring the matrix @xmath136 in ( [ 1.2 ] ) with all nonzeroth elements , like in a multichannel problem @xcite .",
    "the latter would correspond to the potential being nonlocal with respect to one of the coordinate variables ( in our case @xmath24 ) .",
    "if the consideration were made in the polar coordinate system , nonlocality with respect to discrete angles would occur . in the case of continuous coordinates ,",
    "the inverse problem for the potential , nonlocal relative to angles , was considered by kay and moses @xcite .",
    "in this section , we describe the algebraic procedure by taking into considaration simple kernels @xmath137 in the form of a sum of several terms with a factorized coordinate dependence @xmath138 here the functions @xmath139 are combined as elements of the vector @xmath140 obtained as a product of the matrix solutions @xmath141 taken at eigenvalues @xmath142 of the reconstructed @xmath15 and the vector @xmath143 @xmath144 the elements @xmath145 form the normalization matrix @xmath146 with elements @xmath147 corresponding to the bound state @xmath148 , @xmath149 .    like @xmath137 , the ortogonalization kernel @xmath121 is also presented as a sum of several factorized terms .",
    "really , substituting ( [ 1.q ] ) into the gelfand levitan equation ( [ gl ] ) , we obtain @xmath150 noting that the expression in braces is the solution @xmath151 ( [ 1.4 ] ) at @xmath152 of eq.([1.1 ] ) with the desired potentials @xmath153 and",
    "@xmath123 , we immediately receive @xmath154 it is evident now that the new wave functions @xmath86 , determined by ( [ 1.4 ] ) with the kernel @xmath107 taken in the form ( [ 1.k ] ) , are related to the old ones @xmath65 by @xmath155    in view of ( [ 1.k ] ) for @xmath94 in eqs .",

    "thus , the operator @xmath94 defined by ( [ 1.k ] ) transforms the solutions @xmath160 of eq .",
    "( [ 1.1a ] ) into the solutions @xmath161 of eq.([1.1 ] ) , determined by ( [ 1.4 ] ) or ( [ 1.4bar ] ) , with the potentials @xmath153 and @xmath123 defined by ( [ a - nm ] ) , ( [ b - nm ] ) and ( [ c - nm ] ) .",
    "it is not difficult to see from the definitions ( [ q ] ) and ( [ 1.6a ] ) that the kernels @xmath137 and @xmath107 like ( [ 1.q ] ) and ( [ 1.k ] ) can be obtained provided that the spectral weight functions @xmath73 and @xmath162 for both the sets of potentials coincide except , for instance , @xmath72 eigenvalues at @xmath142 .",
    "this permits one to construct potentials with @xmath72 new bound states by using ( [ a - nm ] ) , ( [ c - nm ] ) and ( [ b - nm ] ) or generate the family of spectral - equivalent potentials whose spectra coincide @xmath163 and it is only the normalization factors @xmath164 that are different . in the latter case @xmath137 is taken in the form @xmath165 and the above procedure can be used to construct spectral - equivalent operators @xmath166 and @xmath15 . in spite of a complicated form of the expressions for the potentials ( [ a - nm ] ) , ( [ b - nm ] ) and ( [ c - nm ] ) , they are simplified for a large set of particular cases .",
