    "collective oscillations of active elements are observed in a variety of physical , chemical , and biological systems far from equilibrium .",
    "numerous studies have been devoted to the mutual entrainment of oscillators that have different intrinsic frequencies  @xcite .",
    "a class of phase oscillators with global ( or mean - field ) coupling have enjoyed deep theoretical understanding  @xcite , while a myriad of unresolved problems still remain on the behaviors of locally  @xcite and non - locally  @xcite coupled oscillators . in particular , knowledge about synchronization caused by long - range interactions is quite limited  @xcite , although they are ubiquitous in nature in the form of , e.g. , gravitational , electromagnetic , elastic , and hydrodynamic forces",
    ".    biologically important examples of long - ranged synchronization are provided by swimming microorganisms that are interacting hydrodynamically , such as sperm flagella beating in harmony  @xcite , and metachronal waves in cilia  @xcite .",
    "both of these oscillatory elements , flagella and cilia , are driven by molecular motors embedded in the cell surface , and interact through the viscous environment ( water ) . in order to describe their synchronized motion ,",
    "several theoretical models have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "while all of these initial studies are focused on a homogeneous set of identical systems , it will be important to consider the role of disorder , as real biological motors possess intrinsic heterogeneities that could affect the collective dynamics .",
    "an example of collective yet heterogeneous dynamics is found in a bacterial carpet , which is recently introduced as a new type of microfluidic device  @xcite .",
    "the assembly is composed of a dense monolayer of bacteria that are attached to a solid substrate by their bodies ( heads ) .",
    "their flagella ( tails ) , on the other hand , can freely rotate in the fluid and are orientationally ordered by hydrodynamic interaction , to generate coordinated fluid motion .",
    "evolution of correlated regions is observed , but the ordering remains partial .",
    "observations of irregular and slowly varying flow structures ( whirlpools and rivers ) suggest the presence of heterogeneity in the configurations of the rotors  @xcite .",
    "fabrication of more efficient microfluidic pumps could be achieved through understanding and controlling the heterogeneity .",
    "recently , we have proposed a generic model of hydrodynamically coupled rotors arrayed on a substrate , and studied the collective dynamics of uniform elements  @xcite . in this letter , using a variant of the model , we address the effect of random intrinsic frequencies on synchronization . to be concrete ,",
    "we consider a simple and idealized model of bacterial carpets , where a flagellated bacterium is mounted to each rotor nearly ( but not completely ) radially .",
    "depending on the mounting angle of the flagellum , it generates a torque that drives the rotor in either clockwise or counterclockwise direction .",
    "we assume that the mounting angle and hence the intrinsic frequency of the rotor are randomly distributed . by varying the degree of randomness , we study the transition from coherent to incoherent regimes numerically .",
    "our results suggest that synchronization of the rotors , and hence collective pumping of the fluid , requires a quite narrow distribution of the mounting angle in realistic cases . in order to understand the transition behavior",
    ", we apply the mean - field theory , which is originally developed for global coupling , to our long - ranged system .",
    "while we obtain a fair agreement between theory and simulation for the synchronization threshold , the transition is shown to be more gradual than in globally coupled oscillators .",
    "we consider an array of rotors positioned on a square lattice of grid size @xmath0 .",
    "each rotor has a thin , freely - rotatable arm on the tip of which a flagellated bacterium is mounted .",
    "the bacterium consists of a spherical bead of radius @xmath1 ( body ) and a thin tail that lies horizontally ( flagellum ) .",
    "motion of the bead is constrained on a circular orbit of radius @xmath2 located at height @xmath3 from the substrate , which we take to be the @xmath4-plane .",
    "the position of the @xmath5-th bead is thus given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is its base position on the square lattice and @xmath8 is the unit vector that gives the orientation of the arm via its phase @xmath9 .",
    "the velocity of the bead reads @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the unit vector tangential to the trajectory .",

    "the presence of a characteristic period is also directly observed in the plot of @xmath69 in fig .",
    "[ variance](c ) .",
    "although the origin of the oscillation is beyond the scope of the present paper , a preliminary study shows that the oscillatory behavior at the threshold angle is a unique feature resulting from the long - ranged nature of the interaction .",
