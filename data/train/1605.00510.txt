    "secondly , the structures , shapes , orientations , sizes , directions and speeds of cmes are highly variable , i.e.  it is quite difficult to describe all cmes by a single propagation model .",
    "since the launch of stereo , methods have been developed that exploit the observations made by the heliospheric imagers ( hi ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , providing additional views of cmes propagating all the way out to 1  au and beyond . many of those methods assume a specified geometry for the cme frontal shape ( usually a circle subtending a fixed angular width at the sun , which encompasses , in one limit , a point ) , a constant propagation speed and a fixed direction of motion . with these assumptions , it is possible to fit the time - elongation profile of the cme front to derive estimates of its launch time , radial speed and propagation direction from which its arrival time and speed at a specific target in interplanetary space , usually earth , can be predicted @xcite .",
    "@xcite applied such forecasting methods to 24 cmes observed by stereo / hi and found a mean difference between the forecasted and detected arrival times at 1  au of @xmath9 hrs and a mean difference between forecasted and detected arrival speeds of @xmath10 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the main drawback of these fitting methods is the constant speed assumption that systematically overestimates the arrival speed , especially of cmes that are actually decelerating @xcite .",
    "the propagation speed of cmes tends to approach that of the ambient solar wind , i.e.  fast events tend to decelerate and slow ones tend to accelerate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is ongoing through the stereo / hi1 field of view @xcite , which extends from @xmath11 to @xmath12 elongation , the latter of which corresponds to radial distances of @xmath13 r@xmath14 . in order to be able to account for such an evolution in cme speed ,",

    "the disadvantage of elevo and dbm is that they rely on coronagraph data , which allows cmes to be observed out to a maximum heliocentric distance of only @xmath15 r@xmath16 .",
    "heliospheric imagery provides the possibility of tracking a cme out to a much larger distance leading to the chance of achieving better reliability of its derived kinematics .    in this study",
    ", we present a new method of exploiting single spacecraft hi observations , either from stereo or from any other future mission carrying such instrumentation , such as the wide - field imager for _ solar probe plus _ ( wispr ; * ? ? ? * ) or the heliospheric imager ( solohi ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) aboard _ solar orbiter _ : the ellipse conversion method ( elcon ) .",
    "elcon converts the observed elongation angle ( the angle between the sun - observer line and the line of sight ) into a radial distance from sun center , assuming an elliptical cme front propagating along a fixed direction .",
    "the cme width , propagation direction and the ellipse aspect ratio are free parameters .",
    "the combination of the elcon method , the dbm fitting , and the elevo model allows use of hi observations to forecast cme arrival time without compromising arrival speed ; this combination forms the new forecasting utility elevohi .",
    "in order to introduce and test elevohi , we analyze a sample of 21 cmes observed by hi on the stereo a spacecraft between the years 2008 and 2012 . for each event , the in situ arrival time and speed of the cme at 1  au is available , either from its passage over _ wind _ or over stereo  b. the sample covers slow events during the solar minimum period as well as fast cmes during solar maximum .",
    "the list was compiled by @xcite to test existing hi fitting methods used for forecasting cme arrival times and speeds .",
    "while the event list of @xcite contains 24 cmes , this study excludes three of them , for different reasons .",
    "event number 3 ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was the trailing edge of a cme .",
    "we exclude this event since our study focuses on predicting the arrival of the cme leading edge .",
    "event number 4 was imaged from stereo b , while in this study we consider only cmes that were imaged from stereo a. finally , we exclude event number 11 , which is the same cme as event number 12 , but in situ detected by stereo b.",
    "the ellipse evolution model ( elevo ) was developed by @xcite and assumes an elliptical cme leading edge with a predefined half - width and aspect ratio .",
    "it makes use of the dbm @xcite and is able to provide forecasts of arrival time and speed at any target in the inner heliosphere .",
    "altogether , elevo needs 8 input parameters : the ellipse angular half - width , @xmath17 , and inverse aspect ratio , @xmath18 , the propagation direction , @xmath0 , the start time , @xmath19 , and initial speed , @xmath20 , the latter two at the radial distance , @xmath21 , the mean background solar wind speed , @xmath22 , and the drag parameter , @xmath23 . using the newly developed ellipse conversion method ( elcon ,",

    "the required parameters can be provided by a combination of elcon and dbm fitting .",
    "it is possible to derive @xmath0 from the fpf technique , which is an easy and fast approach applied to hi elongation profiles , i.e.  no other data is needed . using only stereo / hi data",

    "figure [ fig : fchart ] shows the forecasting scheme of elevohi .",
    "the blue ellipses show the different components of the method , the grey parts show the parameters required by , and obtained from , each of these components .",
    "starting at the top of the flowchart , we acquire the time - elongation profile , @xmath24 , from hi observations .",
    "fpf analysis of the time - elongation profile provides an estimate of @xmath0 as input for elcon , which then converts the elongation profile to radial distance assuming an elliptical geometry ( see appendix ) .",
    "as noted previously , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , also required as input to elcon , must be assumed . the distance profile produced by elcon",
    "is then fitted using the dbm  building the derivative of both yields the speed profile .",
    "the required parameters are then input into elevo , which forecasts the arrival time , @xmath25 , and the arrival speed , @xmath26 , of the cme .",
    "as noted above , we term this entire procedure elevohi .",
    "the first step in forecasting cme arrival time and speed using elevohi is to track the time - elongation profile of the cme in the ecliptic plane .",
    "for this purpose the satplot tool is very convenient . with this tool we can extract the cme track from a time - elongation map ( commonly called a j - map ; * ? ? ? * ) and , additionally , a fpf analysis can be performed .",
    "time - elongation profiles for all cmes , presented by @xcite and used in this article , are extracted using the satplot tool .",
    "similar to the three conversion methodologies , well used for interpreting stereo / hi data , based on fixed-@xmath0 @xcite , harmonic mean ( hm ; * ? ? ?",

    "the mathematical derivation of the elcon method is given in the appendix . by applying equation [ eq : rell ] from the appendix ,",
    "the observed elongation angle along with a cme is detected , @xmath27 , can be converted into the radial distance , @xmath28 , of the cme apex from sun center .",
    "it is assumed that the line - of - sight from the observer forms the tangent to the leading edge of the cme , similar to the hm and sse conversion methods .",

    "moreover , both have the same angular half - width , @xmath17 . from this figure",
    "it is clear that the time of impact of the cme at the in - situ observatory would not only depend upon its radial speed , but would also clearly depend critically upon the cme s inverse aspect ratio ( as well , of course , as the angular offset between the in situ observatory and the cme apex ) .",
    "moreover , it is also clear , that for a cme where @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 is the semi - major axis and @xmath33 is the semi - minor axis ) it is particularly important to have an accurate propagation direction in order to achieve an accurate arrival time .      for converting the elongation of the cme in the stereo / hi observations to radial distance , we need to input the assumed half - width , @xmath17 , and inverse aspect ratio , @xmath34 , and the propagation direction , @xmath0 . here",
    ", we obtain the latter parameter by fitting the time - elongation profile from stereo / hi using the fpf method .    the fixed-@xmath0 fitting method ( fpf ; * ? ? ?",

    "the disadvantage when using fpf is , that we have to assume the input parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 for elcon .",
    "other methods , such as gcs , could potentially provide estimates of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the equation to fit the time - elongation profile is given by    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the distance between sun center and the observer .",

    "table [ tab : split ] shows the mean values and standard deviations of @xmath109 and @xmath110 of the elevohi , fpf , hmf and ssef forecasts for events 110 ( 2008early 2011 ) and events 1121 ( 20112012 ) .",
    "compared to solar maximum , we find the elevohi arrival time forecast to be more accurate during low solar activity by about @xmath133 hrs .",
    "the arrival speed forecast shows the same behavior , were the difference between solar minimum and maximum is @xmath134 km s@xmath4 .",
    "this behavior is even larger for fpf , hmf and ssef  especially for the arrival speed forecasts .",
    "@xcite compared the performance of the dbm model with that of the `` wsa - enlil+cone '' model @xcite .",
    "they found that the latter yielded a mean arrival time error of @xmath135 hrs . in order to make their dbm forecast ,",
    "three different combinations of @xmath23 and @xmath22 were used .",
    "dbm yielded a mean arrival time error of @xmath136 hrs , over all combinations . splitting their sample of 50 cmes by solar activity , revealed ( as we also see here ) a smaller arrival time error during solar minimum conditions and a larger error during solar maximum .    for four cmes in our event list ( events 1 , 3 , 4 , and 6 ) , we find that the resulting drag parameter , @xmath23 , is higher than usual ( @xmath137 km@xmath4 ) . for one event , @xmath138 km@xmath4 , which may be a consequence of the dbm fit starting too close to the sun .",
    "however , for this event , the fit does not converge if one assumes a later value for @xmath19 .",
    "nevertheless , the forecasted arrival time and speed errors are not significantly worse than for other cmes .",
    "there are several possible reasons why this fit might yield an `` unphysically '' high value for the drag parameter .",
    "one such possibility may be the difference between the assumed and true background solar wind speed acting on the cme during its propagation .",
    "note that the value of the solar wind speed ultimately used by elevo to provide time / speed estimates is that value ( from the range delimited by the minimum and maximum solar wind speed over the course of the hi observations ) that gives the best dbm fit .",
    "forecasting the arrival speed of cmes plays a major role in the prediction of geomagnetic storm intensities .",
    "the strength of a geomagnetic storm is quantified through the use of several geomagnetic indices , one being the disturbance storm time ( @xmath139 ) index . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have developed models to derive @xmath139 from solar wind parameters , in particular the @xmath140 component of the magnetic field vector and the solar wind speed .",
    "determining the magnetic field orientation within cmes , prior to their arrival at earth , particularly @xmath140 , is one of the most important topics in space weather research and operational space weather .",
    "while such forecasting of @xmath140 is as yet unachievable in practice , elevohi does appear to provide a reliable speed forecast that could be used to model @xmath139 .",
    "in order to assess this approach , we have calculated the @xmath139 index for a cme ( event number 20 in our list ) that had a shock arrival speed of @xmath141 km s@xmath4 , and that resulted in a moderate geomagnetic storm with a minimum @xmath139 of @xmath142 nt .",
    "we used the imf @xmath140 component measured in situ by _ wind _ and a variety of different values of cme arrival speeds ( within the errors of elevohi and the fpf method ) to model @xmath139 using the method of obrien & mcpherron .",
    "use of the measured in situ arrival speed , results in a modeled minimum @xmath139 of @xmath143 nt . adding the mean arrival speed error over all cmes , @xmath144 km s@xmath4 , from elevohi with @xmath30 , to the in situ cme speed for this interval , yields a minimum value for @xmath139 of @xmath145 nt ; adding instead the standard deviation of @xmath146 km s@xmath4 gives @xmath147 nt .",
    "adding @xmath148 km s@xmath4 , the mean arrival speed error from fpf , to the in situ cme speed , gives @xmath149 nt ; adding the fpf standard deviation of 301 km s@xmath4 results in @xmath150 nt .",
    "correctly predicting cme arrival speed at earth is of great importance for modeling the intensities of geomagnetic storms  this issue appears to be very well addressed using elevohi .",
    "a very important factor for space weather forecasting is the prediction lead time .",
    "this is the time between when the prediction is performed until the impact of the cme .",
    "the prediction lead times of elevohi for the cmes under study lie in the range of @xmath151 hrs , which is similar to that quoted by @xcite as we use a subset of those events . using a shorter hi track to extend the prediction lead time ,",
    "would likely lead to some increase in forecasting errors .",

    "this improvement has a direct impact on the accuracy of predicting the intensity of geomagnetic storms at earth .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the drag force is dominant at heliocentric distances of 1550 r@xmath14 .",

    "our study supports this conclusion ; we find dbm applicable beyond a mean heliocentric distance , @xmath21 , of @xmath187 r@xmath14 .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , it is quite likely that the fpf method ( as well as hmf and ssef ) performs better if it is applied to data starting at a larger heliocentric distance as well .",
    "elevohi requires the presence of a heliospheric imager instrument providing a side view of the sun - earth line .",
    "these data must be available in near real - time , with an acceptable quality , to be able to use them for predicting cme arrival @xcite .",
    "the necessity of hosting heliospheric imagers at l4 and/or l5 is obvious when one compares the efficacy of using hi data to forecast cme arrival to methods using coronagraph data .",
    "for example , @xmath188 of the coronagraph - driven dbm and wsa - cone model enlil arrival time forecasts lie within the range of @xmath7 hrs @xcite . using elevohi , with the benefit of hi observations ,",
    "this value is improved to around @xmath2 hrs .",
    "our study shows that there is no significant difference between the three aspect ratios used .",
    "a follow up study may discover the most appropriate curvature ( and indeed angular width ) to select by comparing the results to multiple longitudinally separated spacecraft detecting the cme arrival .",
    "we use the ellipse conversion method ( elcon ) , to calculate the distance of the cme apex to sun center , @xmath28 , as a function of elongation , @xmath27 , which is the angle between the sun - observer line and the line of sight , assumed to be the tangent to the elliptical cme front .",
    "the elongation of the cme front , @xmath27 , is available from stereo / hi imagery .",
    "we also know the distance of the observer to the sun , @xmath37 .",
    "the cme propagation direction , @xmath0 , can be obtained by fixed-@xmath0 fitting ( see section [ sec : input ] ) , the inverse ratio of the semi - axes , @xmath34 , and the cme half - width , @xmath17 , need to be assumed . figure [ fig : meth ] illustrates the elcon geometry .    by applying the sine rule to the yellow triangle",
