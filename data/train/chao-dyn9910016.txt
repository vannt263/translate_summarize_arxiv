    "dissipation of energy from a physical system to a thermal bath takes place as a result of a fluctuating force that acts on the system because of its coupling to the bath .",
    "the dissipative friction force is proportional to the correlation function of the fluctuating force .",
    "the force resulting from coupling to a chaotic system is also fluctuating .",
    "the question that will be studied in the present paper is on what time scales it leads to friction and what is the relation of this friction to the autocorrelation function of the fluctuating force .",
    "an example is slow particle coupled to a fast particle so that the motion of the fast particle is chaotic for each position of the slow particle .",
    "various models for dissipation of energy from a slow particle by a fast one have been developed .",
    "to our knowledge the first models of this type were introduced in the context of nuclear physics @xcite . in particular , a model where particles move within a region bounded by a deforming boundary , modeling the nuclear surface was studied @xcite .",
    "the energy transferred between the boundary and particles enclosed inside was calculated classically and quantum mechanically in the framework of some approximations .",
    "recently some detailed numerical simulations were performed along these lines and the regime of validity of various approximations was tested @xcite .",
    "the dissipation for a wide class of model systems was explored by wilkinson and austin [ 4 - 6 ] in the framework of random matrix theory ( rmt ) , relevant for a situation where the motion of the fast particles is chaotic .",
    "the relation to landau - zener tunneling was also studied in these works .",
    "a different rmt model was studied by mizutori and aberg @xcite . in all these studies dissipation",
    "was found .",
    "in addition , a different approach , aimed at emphasizing the relation to many body problems was introduced @xcite . a unified picture of many of these models has recently been presented by cohen @xcite .",
    "a systematic investigation of the interaction of a slow system with a fast one is possible with the help of multiple scale analysis . under such conditions ott demonstrated @xcite that the phase space volume enclosed by the energy surface of the fast particle is an adiabatic invariant , namely its change is much slower than that of the fast particle hamiltonian .",
    "it has been demonstrated for various conditions that it is indeed an adiabatic invariant @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we study the behavior of a slow particle that is coupled to a fast chaotic system .",
    "a model for such a system , that is quite general , and has been studied by berry and robbins ( br ) @xcite and by jarzynski @xcite in the framework of multiple scale analysis , is defined by the hamiltonian : @xmath0 the phase space coordinates of the slow particle are @xmath1 and its mass is @xmath2 . for simplicity",
    "it is coupled only through its position to the fast system whose phase space coordinates are @xmath3 .",
    "the latter system has the property that if @xmath4 is kept fixed it is fully chaotic .",
    "the crucial feature of the system we wish to study in this work is that it exhibits a wide separation of time scales- the evolution of the fast system , characterized by the time scale @xmath5 , is so rapid that it explores all of the phase space accessible to it energetically before the slow particle , characterized by the time scale @xmath6 , moves appreciably .",
    "the adiabaticity parameter is @xmath7 .",
    "one way to realize this is to couple two particles with a mass ratio of @xmath8 , as one can see by rescaling the equations of motion .",
    "we now turn to analyze the dynamics generated by the hamiltonian ( [ brjhamiltonian ] ) with the approximation that the slow particle evolves under the influence of the _ average _ force exerted on it by the fast system , which can be treated as a system described by a slowly varying hamiltonian .",
    "the time dependence of this hamiltonian is determined by the dynamics of the slow particle .",
    "first the classical dynamics is outlined and later the quantum mechanical behavior is summarized . in the case of ( [ brjhamiltonian ] )",
    "the average force is given by : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a normalized probability density in the fast particle phase space .",
    "a formalism that includes _ fluctuations _ was developed by jarzynski @xcite .",
    "the results of this paper do not depend on these fluctuations and therefore the formalism of br will be used .",
    "the probability density satisfies the liouville equation : @xmath11 written in a way that emphasizes that the evolution of the fast system is indeed on a much shorter time scale than the time scale on which the fast hamiltonian changes .",
    "@xmath12 denotes poisson brackets taken with respect to @xmath13 . with the aid of the multiple scale expansion : @xmath14 berry and robbins @xcite were able to calculate the force acting on the slow particle up to first order in @xmath15 : @xmath16 to leading order , the force is given by the classical analogue of the born - oppenheimer force : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is chosen such that the phase space volume enclosed by the energy surface of the fast particle , @xmath19 , is constant .",
    "the leading correction to @xmath20 includes a velocity dependent force : @xmath21_{e = e({\\bf r})},\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and : @xmath23 in the last equation : @xmath24 denotes the microcanonical average and @xmath25 .",
    "finally , @xmath26 in ( [ brcij ] ) is the classical trajectory obtained by integrating the equations of motion generated by @xmath27 with fixed @xmath4 backwards from @xmath13 for the time @xmath28 .",
    "in addition to the velocity dependent force ( [ f1 ] ) , and to the same order in @xmath15 , there is a force that does not depend on velocity @xcite .",
    "this force can be expressed as a gradient of a time dependent potential , and therefore is a correction to the born - oppenheimer force ( [ f0 ] ) . because of the form of @xmath29 , it describes two qualitatively different forces .",
    "the first of these is geometric magnetism , and it is related to the antisymmetric part of @xmath30 .",
    "this force has been studied analytically in the systems under discussion by br @xcite and numerically by berry and sinclair @xcite .",
    "the second force is associated with the symmetric part of @xmath30 and is related to deterministic friction .",
    "this force has been studied in @xcite .",
    "a central question that can be addressed at this point is under which conditions does the slow particle feel friction due to the velocity dependent force @xmath31 . in order for this to happen @xmath30 of ( [ f1 ] )",
    "has to have a positive definite symmetric part .    the behavior when the fast system is quantum mechanical , to first order in @xmath32 , has also been studied by br @xcite .",
    "they found that in this case @xmath30 is an antisymmetric tensor , meaning that the system exhibits _ only _ geometric magnetism and _ no _ friction .",
    "this difference is a result of the discreteness of the quantum spectrum .",
    "the quantum correlation function corresponding to the symmetric part of @xmath33 of ( [ brcij ] ) is : @xmath34,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the infinite time integral over it vanishes @xcite . in order to understand how the crossover between the classical and quantum behavior occurs , it is instructive to calculate the integral of the correlation function over a finite time .",
    "since the discordance between the quantum and the classical models appears in the symmetric part of @xmath30 it can be studied for the case where @xmath4 is replaced be a scalar , time dependent parameter , @xmath35 . in this case",
    "@xmath36 will be denoted by @xmath37 for simplicity ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 on the rhs of ( [ brcijq ] ) will then be replaced by the scalar parameter @xmath35 ) .",
    "following br we assume in the calculation that the initial state is an eigenstate of the hamiltonian , @xmath40 .",
    "it was verified by br that their result holds also if the initial state is a mixture .",
    "our calculation can also be extended to a mixture leading to the same results .",
    "if the initial state is a pure state but not an eigenstate of the hamiltonian one can check that within the assumptions of the paper the results are similar to the ones found if the initial state is an eigenstate of the hamiltonian .",
    "the finite time integral that should be calculated then is : @xmath41 the correlation function and its integral may depend on the initial state @xmath42 .",
    "this dependence has been suppressed in the notation for simplicity . in what follows",
    ", it will become clear that it is not important for the results of the present paper .",
    "taking the classical limit @xmath43 for any finite @xmath44 and then the limit @xmath45 should result in a non - vanishing value of @xmath46 , while for any finite value of @xmath47 , @xmath46 should vanish .",
    "the friction on the time scale @xmath44 is proportional to @xmath48 as can easily be inferred from ( [ f1 ] ) and ( [ briij ] ) . the experimental meaning of this statement will be clarified in what follows . in order to understand the mechanism of this discordance , br studied a model correlation function where the levels were equally spaced .",
    "they found that the function is periodic in time with period @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the level spacing .",
    "moreover , in the classical limit , which in their model corresponds to taking @xmath51 , @xmath37 approaches the classical correlation function . for systems",
    "whose classical dynamics is chaotic , the energy levels are not equally spaced , but rather are distributed according to rmt @xcite .",
    "the long time behavior of @xmath48 is determined by the levels nearest to @xmath42 , namely @xmath52 , as can be seen from ( [ brcijq ] ) .",
    "therefore , one may expect behavior different from the one found for the equally spaced spectrum .",
    "the natural question to ask is whether there is a characteristic time scale for the crossover between the quantum behavior of the integral @xmath48 and its classical behavior .",
    "the most nave answer to this question is that the characteristic time scale is the heisenberg time , because it is the only time scale in the problem , and it is on this time scale that the quantum to classical crossover usually takes place . on the other hand",
    ", one can argue that there is no time scale for this crossover at all @xcite .",
    "in rmt the probability for two consecutive levels to be separated by a distance @xmath53 behaves like @xmath54 for small spacings [ 19 - 22 ] .",
    "consequently , @xmath55 for long times , where here @xmath56 denotes the rmt ensemble average , and @xmath57 is the integral ( [ indef ] ) for some @xmath58 .",
    "the answer given by the analysis presented in this paper is surprising . for the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) ( @xmath59 ) one",
    "indeed finds that @xmath60 decays like @xmath61 , but for the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) ( @xmath62 ) one finds that it decays like a gaussian with a characteristic time proportional to the heisenberg time or vanishes after the heisenberg time depending of the parametric dependence on @xmath35 .",
    "the integral @xmath63 was also calculated for other values of @xmath58 .",
    "why is the nature of the decay of @xmath64 important ?",
    "there is the quantum - classical discordance that has already been mentioned , and one would like to analyze the scale that is required to observe the crossover between the regimes .",
    "it is relevant for some experiments , that will be mentioned below .",
    "in addition , there is the issue of the relevance of such an effect .",
    "the time over which the correlation function decays should be compared with other time scales present in the specific system studied .",
    "one such time scale is @xmath65 , which is the time scale for the breakdown of the first order of the multiple scale analysis .",
    "non - perturbative effects , such as landau - zener tunneling , become important on a time scale of @xmath66 . in realistic experiments",
    "there is also the time scale for quantum decoherence @xmath67 . in order to observe the classical to quantum crossover discussed in the present work",
    "@xmath60 should exhibit substantial decay for @xmath68 and of the order of @xmath67 .",
    "the model discussed in the present work is relevant for some experimental situations .",
    "consider for example a molecular beam prepared in a classical configuration , where initially many levels are substantially populated .",
    "the beam travels in a slowly varying field @xcite .",
    "consequently the internal dynamics in the molecules is in a slowly varying potential . on short time",
    "scales the behavior is classical , the integral of the correlation function is positive and energy is absorbed in the motion of the internal degrees of freedom .",
    "on longer time scales the integral of the correlation function decays to zero and therefore one realizes that actually no energy is absorbed by the molecules .",
    "the outcome of the experiment depends on the time scale of decoherence , @xmath67 , that is , the energy absorption by the internal degrees of freedom is proportional to @xmath69 .",
    "another example is of quantum dots where parameters are varied adiabatically , like in pumping experiments , but with dots that are closed , so that their spectrum is discrete @xcite .    in section [ secrmt ] a specific rmt model",
    "is defined . for this model",
    "the ensemble average of the integral of the correlation function ( [ indef ] ) is calculated analytically .",
    "it is demonstrated that most of the contribution for long times originates from the nearest neighbor levels . in section [ nnd ]",
    "the integral of the correlation function ( [ indef ] ) , predicted by the nearest neighbor level spacing distribution , is calculated for various distributions , including some that are not related to rmt models . in section [ secdiscussion ]",
    "the results of this work are analyzed and discussed .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to study ( [ brcijq ] ) and its finite time integral ( [ indef ] ) in the framework of rmt .",
    "the reason for this is that random matrices describe many characteristic properties of realistic quantum - chaotic systems [ 17 , 25 - 28 ] . for simplicity",
    "our random matrices will depend on one external parameter @xmath35 , so that we shall study the one dimensional version of ( [ brcijq ] ) , where the vector of parameters @xmath70 is replaced by the scalar @xmath35 . for each random matrix",
    "we shall be able to calculate both @xmath37 and @xmath48 .",
    "we wish to construct a random matrix model for some of the levels of a system whose quantum hamiltonian depends on some parameter .",
    "the @xmath71 levels we wish to simulate by the random matrix lie within an energy strip of width @xmath72 , that depends on @xmath71 . later on we shall be interested in studying the semiclassical limit .",
    "the meaning of taking this limit in the present context is to increase the density of levels in the @xmath73-strip : in the classical limit the spectrum becomes continuous .",
    "we shall work with the well studied gaussian ensembles @xcite .",
    "these are defined through four parameters : @xmath58 which defines the symmetry of the random matrices , their dimension @xmath71 , the mean value of their elements and their variance ( given through the parameter @xmath74 ) .",
    "all of these need to be chosen carefully in terms of parameters of the physical system , being simulated by the random matrix .",
    "the symmetry of the ensemble should be chosen to correspond to the real system . if the latter exhibits time reversal symmetry then the ensemble is the orthogonal one @xmath75 .",
    "if the system does not exhibit this symmetry then the ensemble is unitary @xmath76 .",
    "the mean value of the matrix elements can be chosen to be zero , which corresponds to setting the ensemble average of the reference level @xmath77 .",
    "the mean level density satisfies the semi - circle law @xcite : @xmath78 for large @xmath71 , where we have used the definition : @xmath79 . in subsection [ secshort ]",
    "the relation between the parameters of the rmt model and the ones of the physical system will be discussed .",
    "we shall use the hamiltonian introduced by austin and wilkinson @xcite and model a parameter dependent system by the @xmath80 random matrix : @xmath81 where @xmath82 are @xmath80 random matrices from the same goe or gue ensemble .",
    "there are three advantages to working with @xmath83 : ( a ) it belongs to the same ensemble that @xmath82 belong to , ( b ) the derivatives of its matrix elements belong to the same ensemble too because : @xmath84 ( c ) the matrices @xmath83 and @xmath85 are statistically independent . if we insert @xmath83 and @xmath85 into eq .",

    "[ iandk ] ) . since the form factor is known in rmt , the integral of the correlation function was calculated and found to vanish for times beyond the heisenberg time for gue and to fall off as a power law for goe .",
    "this is a remarkable and surprising difference .",
    "the result for gse is similar to the one found for gue , except that the integral of the correlation function vanishes after twice the heisenberg time .",
    "the properties of the model ( [ model ] ) are satisfied approximately by many systems @xcite , therefore it is expected that the results of this work are relevant for a wide range of problems . for the model ( [ model ] ) we have shown that for long times the results are dominated by the nearest neighbor spacings . if only these spacings are taken into account one finds that for long times the integral falls off as a power law for goe and as a gaussian , where the characteristic time is proportional to the heisenberg time for gue and gse .",
    "these results do not require all the properties of the model ( [ model ] ) .",
    "they require only that the contribution of the fluctuations in the absolute value of the matrix elements between nearest neighboring states ( neighboring in energy ) is negligible , namely that the contribution of @xmath229 of ( [ dcn ] ) can be ignored compared to the one of @xmath230 .",
    "this is clearly a weaker assumption than complete statistical independence between @xmath227 and @xmath228 .",
    "therefore we expect the difference found between goe and gue ( as well as gse ) to be generic for rmt models with various dependencies on the parameter @xmath35 .",
    "the long time behavior of the rmt models is expected to provide a faithful representation of the behavior of chaotic systems , since it is dominated by the small level spacings .",
    "for short times , on the other hand , the behavior depends on the specific properties of each system .",
    "the short time behavior of the rmt model was presented here only to set the relation between the constants of the rmt model and the ones of the chaotic system .    the assumption of the dominance of the contribution of nearest neighbor level spacings , together with the assumption that @xmath229 of ( [ dcn ] ) is negligible enables the calculation of the integral @xmath48 of ( [ indef ] ) for various distributions of nearest neighbor level spacings even if these do not necessarily originate from rmt models . for the distribution ( [ psbeta ] ) , that is a generalization of the distributions found for goe , gue and gse , one can calculate @xmath64 for various values of @xmath58 . in section [ nnd ]",
    "it is found to decay as @xmath231 for all values of @xmath58 , except when @xmath58 is a positive even integer , for which it decays like a gaussian with a characteristic time that is proportional to the heisenberg time .",
    "what is special when @xmath58 is a positive even integer ?",
    "for these values the integral ( [ incbeta ] ) can be extended to the range @xmath232 $ ] .",
    "the integrand is an entire function , the contour of integration can be deformed in the complex plane and the integral is dominated by a saddle point . for other values of @xmath58 an extension of the integral to negative @xmath44 , so that the integrand is analytic , is impossible .",
    "the point @xmath233 is an end point and for large @xmath44 the integral is dominated by it , leading to power law decay . for non - integral @xmath58 ,",
    "the point @xmath233 is also a singular point .",
    "it would be nice to find a more physical explanation for this difference between the various ensembles . for completeness the integral of the correlation function",
    "was calculated for the poisson and the semi - poisson distributions .",
    "the various rmt formulas ( eqs .",
    "[ igoe ]  &  [ igue ] ) are developed for the limit of infinite matrices .",
    "this limit is approached extremely fast , as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ figgoe ]  &  [ figgue ] . the convergence to the average , as a function of @xmath120 , the number of members of the ensemble , is slow ( see figs .  [ figgoefluc ]  &  [ figguefluc ] )",
    ".    the crucial approximation that was made generalizing the results beyond the model ( [ model ] ) was neglecting @xmath234 of ( [ dcn ] ) .",
    "although reasonable , its validity for chaotic systems should be checked .",
    "the results may hold also for mixed systems if sticking to integrable regions does not take place on time scales relevant for the calculation .",
    "for chaotic systems corrections of order higher than the leading one , in the adiabatic approximation , may lead to different behavior after some time ( @xmath235 or @xmath66 ) .",
    "dephasing , as a result of the coupling to the environment will destroy the quantum correlations on a time scale @xmath67 . in experiments of the type mentioned in the end of the introduction , dephasing is always present , and if @xmath236 , the system will dissipate energy at a rate proportional to @xmath69 .",
