    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) holds the promise of communication with security resting firmly on the foundation of quantum mechanics rather than unproven assumptions regarding current and future computational resources . in the bb@xmath1 protocol @xcite , the most common prepare and measure protocol , the sender ( alice ) ideally encodes a single photon with a bit value of either @xmath3 or @xmath4 in one of two conjugate bases and sends it to the receiver ( bob ) .",
    "when bob receives a photon , he measures it in one of the two bases .",
    "alice and bob then publicly share their basis choices and only keep the bits where the bases match . because the information is encoded in a single photon , any tampering by an eavesdropper ( eve ) results in an increased error rate detectable by the legitimate users of the system . after performing error correction @xcite to remove any errors that may have arisen from the operations of an eavesdropper or from imperfections in the experimental apparatus , alice and bob",
    "perform a privacy amplification step @xcite to erase any partial information eve might have obtained about the transmission .",
    "the final result is a string of @xmath3s and @xmath4s that alice and bob share but about which eve has negligibly small information .",
    "although it is straightforward to see how qkd with ideal sources and detectors is secure , real - world qkd systems must contend with imperfect experimental components . in @xmath5 , it was pointed out that the use of attenuated lasers ( which emit photons in a poissonian distribution ) drastically limits the secure range of laser - based qkd systems @xcite .",
    "eve could perform a photon number splitting ( pns ) attack in which she selectively changes the channel transmittance based on photon number but still maintains the expected rate of detections at bob .",
    "if the rate of multi - photon pulses at alice is larger than the rate of photon detections at bob , then eve could block all the laser pulses containing single photons , and only allow transmission of the multi - photon pulses , which are inherently insecure . in this case , the entire string of `` secure '' bits could , in fact , be known to eve .",
    "several methods have been proposed to mitigate the effects of pns attacks .",
    "the most straightforward is to simply use a very low mean photon number @xmath6 , on order of the channel transmittance , to guarantee that at least some of the detections at bob originated from single photons at alice @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this results in very low secret bit rates as well as greatly limiting the possible transmission length due to dark counts in the detectors .",
    "the sarg protocol @xcite , which allows for secure bits to be formed from both one- and two - photon signals , outperforms standard bb@xmath1 , but it offers no performance advantage compared to bb@xmath1 with `` decoy states '' as described below @xcite .",
    "differential phase shift qkd ( dps - qkd ) is another method of protecting against pns attacks @xcite , but there does not currently exist a security proof against all attacks for the dps - qkd protocol , so it does not provide the unconditional security needed for qkd .",
    "the use of decoy states @xcite with the bb@xmath1 protocol has provided a method for achieving high bit rates while protecting against pns attacks and maintaining the underlying security of bb@xmath1 . in a decoy state protocol",
    ", alice transmits signals randomly picked from several different mean photon levels @xmath7 rather than just one .",
    "if eve , who is ignorant of the @xmath7 value for each specific signal , were to attempt to perform a pns attack , she would not be able to simultaneously modify the channel transmission for all the @xmath7 values to reproduce the expected statistics at bob . by comparing the number of photon detections at each mean photon level",
    ", alice and bob can determine a rigorous bound on the number of single photons that have been received by bob and incorporate this bound into the privacy amplification step .",
    "decoy state protocols have been demonstrated over a free - space link @xcite and in several different fibre systems @xcite .",
    "however , many of the demonstrations , although they are important proof - of - principle experiments , do not perform the full qkd protocol , including error correction and privacy amplification , but instead only estimate the secret bit rate and range of the system .",
    "furthermore , most systems have employed either local synchronization ( transmitter and receiver share the same clock ) or synchronization over a separate fibre , methods that pose a significant barrier for deployment .",
    "although a practical uni - directional system with remote synchronization has been demonstrated over short distances of @xmath8  km with high bit rates @xcite , the detectors used in these experiments were not sufficiently quiet to enable long - distance fibre qkd .",
    "here we describe the first practical qkd system capable of secure operation over distances greater than @xmath9  km .",
    "the system uses a three - level decoy - state protocol in a fibre phase - encoding quantum key distribution system with independent clocks at the transmitter and receiver and low - noise superconducting nanowire single photon detectors ( snspds ) .",
    "in addition to being secure against pns attacks , our data is secure against a number of other attacks , including trojan horse attacks that affect bi - directional systems , timing attacks based on exploiting detector efficiency mismatch @xcite , and attacks based on differing timing responses between detectors @xcite .",
    "the security of our protocol rests on knowing the number of sifted bits arising from single photons produced by alice , and the disturbance , or bit error rate , on those bits .",
    "our security statement incorporates finite statistics into each step of the protocol .",
    "the number of secret bits distilled from each basis is calculated as a modification from @xcite @xmath10\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the number of sifted bits in the selected basis , @xmath12 is the observed bit error rate in this basis , @xmath13 is a lower bound on the transmittance of single photons , @xmath14 is an upper bound on the single - photon bit error rate in the conjugate basis , @xmath15 is the fraction of zeroes among the sifted bits in this basis , and @xmath16 is the shannon binary entropy function , and @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are privacy amplification , error correction , and deskewing efficiency factors needed to accommodate the finite statistics of the data .",
    "the decoy state protocol allows us to determine a lower bound on the single photon transmittance @xmath13 and an upper bound on the single photon error rate @xmath14 .",
    "the value of @xmath13 is the minimal value of @xmath20 satisfying the following inequalities : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the transmittance of an @xmath23-photon signal and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) is the upper ( lower ) bound on the yield of detection events when mean photon number @xmath7 is used for transmission .",
    "in contrast to other work where @xmath26 are calculated assuming that the underlying detection statistics are gaussian , we make no such assumption and use the full binomial distribution to calculate the bounds within some user - defined confidence level , chosen to be @xmath27 for this experiment .",
    "we use two methods to determine the single photon error rate @xmath28 .",
    "the first , referred to as the `` worst - case '' scenario , makes the conservative assumption that all observed errors occur on single photons . in this case",
    ", @xmath14 is simply equal to the number of observed errors divided by the number of sifted bits that arose from single photons prepared by alice , which can be computed from the lower bound @xmath13 .",
    "however , we can obtain a tighter bound on @xmath28 by utilizing the information contained in the differing error rates at each @xmath7 and constructing a set of inequalities involving the bounds on the observed bit error rates @xmath29 and the @xmath23-photon bit error rates @xmath30 : @xmath31 analogous to the method for finding @xmath13 , @xmath14 is found by determining the maximal value of @xmath28 that satisfies these inequalities . computing this tighter bound on @xmath28",
    "can be carried out by linear programming , as for @xmath13 , but here it is subject to quadratic constraints , so the analysis is computationally more intensive , although still tractable . in either case ,",
    "the bounds on @xmath20 and @xmath28 are valid even if the quantum channel is time - varying .",
    "equation [ nsec_eq ] involves three efficiency factors ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) which quantify finite statistics effects during the stages of qkd .",
    "asymptotically , all three factors approach unity , but for a finite session length they are strictly greater than one .",
    "reconciliation via practical error - correcting algorithms does not achieve the shannon capacity of the binary symmetric channel , and the extra overhead in parity checks that needs to be communicated between alice and bob is expressed by the factor @xmath32 .",
    "privacy amplification involves removing any partial information eve may have gained by disturbing those single - photon signals present among the sifted bits .",
    "following koashi @xcite , we numerically compute the logarithm ( base two ) of the number of typical strings that are needed to describe with high confidence the output of a binary symmetric channel with a given bit flip probability , using the bit error rate in one basis to determine the amount of privacy amplification required in the other basis .",
    "the factor @xmath33 denotes how much the size of this output differs from the shannon entropy of the single - photon signals .",
    "the last finite statistics effect we consider is due to the imbalance between the two detector efficiencies , which leads to a bias between the zeroes and ones for the sifted bits in each basis .",
    "this bias can reduce eve s search space of guessing over likely reconciled keys prior to privacy amplification .",
    "asymptotically , shannon entropy again gives the required reduction in secret information , but any practical algorithm for removing the bias , or _ deskewing _",
    ", is likely to have inefficiencies , which is encompassed by the factor @xmath34 .",
    "we followed peres @xcite in iterating von neumann s algorithm for generating unbiased bits out of the reconciled keys to determine the value of @xmath34 .",
    "optical train of the phase - encoding quantum key distribution system used in this work .",
    "the variable optical attenuator ( voa ) provides attenuation to the single photon level , from which the amplitude modulator provides the different @xmath7 levels needed for the decoy level protocol .",
    "red lines indicate polarization maintaining fibre , and blue lines represent single mode fibre .",
    "photons are detected by two superconducting nanowire single photon detectors ( snspds ) biased to achieve matching detection efficiencies.,width=5 ]    a diagram of the automated , reconfigurable qkd system used @xcite is shown in figure  [ system_diagram_fig ] . a @xmath35",
    "nm distributed feedback laser is pulsed at a clock rate of @xmath36  mhz , and the resulting photons are sent to alice s phase encoder .",
    "the photon wavepacket is split into a `` short '' and a `` long '' path , and the portion of the wavepacket that traversed the long path is modulated by the electro - optic phase modulator , located outside the interferometer for stability .",
    "likewise , the wavepacket is again split in bob s decoder , and only the part of the wavepacket that traveled through alice s long path is modulated .",
    "interference ultimately occurs between the alice - long - bob - short and alice - short - bob - long amplitudes .",
    "polarization maintaining fibre is used within the interferometers to ensure that these two paths are indistinguishable .",
    "the quantum channel consists of @xmath37  km of optical fibre with an attenuation of @xmath38  db per km , and shorter distances are obtained by redefining alice s enclave to include a portion of the fibre .",
    "the bit and basis selections at alice and bob are all determined by the output of physical random number generators , and a high - speed optical switch , driven by a pseudo - random pattern , provides the three intensity levels needed for our decoy state protocol .",
    "( in a deployed system , the pseudo - random pattern generator would simply be replaced by a physical random number generator . )",
    "the superconducting nanowire single photon detectors ( snspds ) @xcite used for these measurements are cooled to @xmath39  kelvin in a closed - cycle refrigeration system and coupled to single - mode telecom fibre .",
    "they operate in ungated mode with a measured full width at half maximum timing jitter of @xmath40 ps and a recovery time of @xmath41 ns . the detectors were individually current biased to a matching detection efficiency of @xmath42% , resulting in a summed average dark count rate over the entire acquisition period of @xmath43 counts / second .",
    "the system is fully automated and able to run for many hours without user intervention .",
    "independent rubidium oscillators are employed as frequency references at alice and bob and are synchronized using only the quantum signals . for each acquisition period ( typically @xmath4@xmath36 seconds ) , a photon arrival time histogram is created that is used to determine the current average frequency offset between the two oscillators , which is corrected by adjusting one of the clocks frequencies .",
    "long - term system stability is achieved through a combination of tuning and qkd runs .",
    "tuning runs are insecure sessions executed at a high photon number to quickly obtain the statistics needed for interferometer and timing adjustments , while qkd runs adhere to the requirements for secure key generation . to minimize the effects of system de - tuning , tuning runs are promptly followed by qkd runs .",
    "the use of ungated detectors and post - selection of detection timestamps in software relaxes the system timing requirements to the phase modulator voltage pulse width , @xmath44@xmath39  ns , rather than being constrained to the sub - nanosecond electrical detector gate width required for avalanche photodiodes . periodically",
    ", the polarization controller is automatically adjusted to compensate for any polarization drifts within the fibre by maximizing transmission through the linear polarizer .",
    "we chose @xmath7 values with associated sending probabilities that were near - optimal for a fibre length of @xmath45  km .",
    "the selected mean photon numbers were @xmath46 ( @xmath47 , ideally the vacuum state , was constrained to be @xmath48  db below the high @xmath49 level by the extinction ratio of the switch ) with associated sending probabilities @xmath50 . in @xmath51 hours of acquisition time and using a timing window of @xmath52  ps , the number of detection events recorded at @xmath49 , @xmath53 , and @xmath47 was @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , respectively , and a total of @xmath57 sifted bits with a bias ( fraction of zeros in one basis ) of @xmath58 were created .",
    "the sifted bits and the basis choices both passed the fips @xmath59-@xmath44 cryptographic randomness tests @xcite . after data were collected , the bits were sifted , error corrected using the modified cascade algorithm @xcite , and privacy amplified as described in equation ( [ nsec_eq ] ) after determining the bounds on the single photon transmittance and error rate .",

    ", width=480 ]    as shown in figure [ longdist_fig ] , @xmath14 , the bound on the single photon error rate , is significantly higher when the worst - case assumption that all the errors occur on single photons is made .",
    "the tighter @xmath28 bound not only yields more secret bits at any given distance , but it also extends the distance over which secret bits can be exchanged .",
    "use of the `` worst - case '' @xmath28 results in @xmath63 secret bits at @xmath45  km and a maximum range of @xmath64  km .",
    "when the tighter bound on @xmath28 is used , @xmath65 secret bits are produced at @xmath45  km and the range of the system is extended to @xmath66  km , a new record for key distribution secure against general attacks @xcite , including photon - number - splitting attacks .    by choosing different",
    "mean photon numbers and sending probabilities and acquiring data for longer times , it would be possible to extend the range even further in this system .",

    "this system could achieve a range of @xmath67  km .",
    "although the detection efficiency of these detectors is currently quite low , by embedding the detectors in a stack of optical elements designed to increase absorption at the target wavelength @xcite and improving the optical coupling to the detector , it should be possible to increase the system detection efficiency considerably .",
    "an increase to @xmath68 ( assuming the same dark count and background photon rates ) would result in bit rates higher by approximately two orders of magnitude at any given distance in the asymptotic limit , and an increase in the tolerable link loss to over @xmath69  db . from our results , which are the first demonstration of assured security over long distances in a deployable system , we can infer that reasonable improvements in component technology will result in several hundred bits per second over distances of @xmath9  km , more than an order of magnitude higher than what is presently available .",
