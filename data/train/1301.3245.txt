    "al . have proposed a dynamical model to explain the aggregation and disaggregation processes observed in saturn s f ring and the b ring outer edge due to the perturbation caused by the saturn s moon , prometheus and mimas , respectively .",
    "their numerical simulations demonstrate that the dynamical model explains certain spacecraft measurements corresponding to these regions in the saturn s ring .",
    "further , these numerical results strongly suggest the existence of a limit cycle for realistic values of the parameters . in this paper , we provide a rigorous mathematical proof of this fact as well as study other features that are relevant from a dynamical point of view .",
    "the model under consideration relates the mean aggregate mass @xmath1 and the velocity dispersion @xmath2 of ring particles at the above mentioned locations in the saturn s ring , as follows    @xmath3    in the first equation of ( [ model ] ) , the first term refers to the coagulation of the ring particles leading to a growth in the mean aggregate mass at an accretion rate @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the accretion period ) and the second term refers to the erosion ( or break - up ) of the larger ring particles due to collisions with other ring particles at collisional rates @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the collisional period ) when their velocity dispersion exceed @xmath8 , the threshold velocity for sticking .    in the second equation of ( [ model ] )",
    ", the first term refers to the dissipative collisions between the ring particles leading to the reduction in velocity dispersion with @xmath9 as the normal coefficient of restitution .",
    "the second term refers to the increase in the velocity dispersion to the escape velocity from mass @xmath1 ( @xmath10 is the escape velocity from an aggregate of mass @xmath11 ) due to the viscous stirring at a rate @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the stirring period ) , caused by the passage of the ring particles of mass @xmath1 .",
    "finally , the last term refers to the periodic forcing by the saturn s moon causing disturbances in the velocity dispersion , where @xmath14 describes the moon perturbation , where @xmath15 is the forcing period , @xmath16 is the forcing amplitude .    for convenience , we reduce the system to an equivalent dimensionless system with the following substitutions : @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the orbital period of the ring particles around saturn , and pass to a more mathematical notation by using @xmath21 .",
    "then , the system in ( [ model ] ) becomes @xmath22 where @xmath23 are all positive parameters , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the ( normalized ) forcing period .",
    "the above dynamical system has two main differences when compared to the predator - prey system .",
    "firstly , in the second equation , we have the @xmath28 term instead of the coupling @xmath29 .",
    "secondly , the external forcing is not standard in ecological models , since the typical forcing is parametrical ( see for instance the model studied in @xcite ) .    despite these differences , the aggregation - disaggregation model represented by this system can be well explained by drawing an analogy with the predator - prey system .",
    "let the mean aggregate mass of the ring particles correspond to the prey population , and the velocity dispersion correspond to the predator population . the velocity dispersion feeds off the accelerations from the aggregates gravity ( in reference to the second term of the second equation ) .",
    "as the velocity dispersion grows too large , it limits the prey as high velocity collisions lead to to fragmentation of the ring particles ( in reference to the second term of the first equation ) . in the absence of the interaction between the predator and the prey ,",
    "the prey population ( mean aggregate mass ) grows and the predator population decays ( in reference to the first terms of the two equations , respectively ) .",
    "in addition , the predator population is periodically controlled in a certain deterministic manner , as represented by the sinusoidal forcing function .    in the following section",
    ", we conduct a thorough qualitative analysis of the above system and comment about the existence and nature of its solution , conditions on uniqueness and asymptotic stability of the solution and finally derive explicit bounds for the solutions .",
    "along with these results , we derive useful insights about the saturn s ring dynamics based on these results .",
    "further , the results in this paper hold for any general forcing functions @xmath30 as long as it is a continuous periodic function of minimal period @xmath31 with zero mean value , i.e. , @xmath32 .",
    "all the results will be presented for this general forcing function , and the sinusoidal forcing function will be explicitly studied in section [ sec : example ] .",
    "numerical results in @xcite strongly suggest the existence of a limit cycle for realistic values of the parameters . in the following theorem",

    "see appendix [ sub : proofth1 ] for the complete proof .    ' '' ''",
    "the above result leads to a physical interpretation that the periodic forcing by the moon gives a limit cycle in the mean aggregate mass and velocity dispersion with the same period as the forcing function .",
    "it is interesting to remark that the latter result can be extended to a family of forcing terms with more complicated recurrence including quasi periodic forcing .",
    "the main result in @xcite implies the existence of a quasi periodic solution and the boundedness of all solutions in the future .",

    "therefore , if @xmath41 is small enough , @xmath33 presents an asymptotically stable @xmath27-periodic orbit .",
    "the remarkable feature of the latter result is that stability is proved on a certain region of the involved parameters independently of the size of the external force @xmath42 .    as we will see in section [ sec : example ] , theorem [ stab1 ] is applicable to the saturn s f - ring , in fact for the @xmath43-ring @xmath44 so condition @xmath45 is satisfied .",

    "the above argument acts as an alternate proof for the later part of the statement in theorem [ th1 ] .",

    "the second bound given by @xmath62 has the advantage that the lower bound is always positive if the external force @xmath42 is not too large . in the model case @xmath69 , it is easy to compute @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and the bounds are direct .    having completed the mathematical analysis of the system ( [ model2 ] ) , in the following section , we consider examples with realistic values of the parameters of the system representing different regions of the saturn s ring and derive useful insights pertinent to the ring dynamics .",

    "[ rem : fixedpoint]the non - trivial , feasible stable fixed point for the unforced dynamic system is @xmath72 .",
    "when externally forced by periodic perturbations from the saturn s moons , the mean aggregate mass and the velocity dispersion demonstrates periodic aggregation - disaggregation cycle with the same period as that of the moon s forcing .",
    "( of theorem [ stab1 ] ) there exists a unique , asymptotically stable limit - cycle for the ( @xmath1,@xmath73 ) system if the forcing period satisfies the condition @xmath74 where the right - hand - side depends on the mean optical depth and the normal coefficient of restitution corresponding to the specific location in the saturn s ring system .",

    "hence , our result is applicable to the f - ring and also to the b - ring outer edge when @xmath79 .",
    "now , we consider a systematic study of each region in the saturn s rings , and start with the dynamics of the b - ring outer edge .    for a sinusoidal forcing function , @xmath80 ,",
    "the upper and lower bounds of the @xmath27-periodic solution for the mass of the aggregate is @xmath81 for @xmath82 , the bounds are obtained from theorems [ th2 ] and [ th3 ] with @xmath83 , @xmath84m / sec , @xmath85m / sec , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",
    "we begin with studying the impact of varying the stirring rate @xmath91 on the amplitudes of the periodic solutions of @xmath92 , and figures [ fig : fstirfig1 ] - [ fig : fstirfig3 ] plot the maxima and minima of the @xmath27-periodic solution of the @xmath93 system obtained using numerical simulations against the derived upper and lower bounds for the @xmath27-periodic solution of the @xmath93 system from theorem [ th2 ] and theorem [ th3 ] .",
    "the system parameters corresponding to the saturn s ring system are @xmath75 , @xmath94 @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 and @xmath98 for figure [ fig : fstirfig1 ] , figure [ fig : fstirfig2 ] and figure [ fig : fstirfig3 ] , respectively . the saturn s b - ring including the janus 2:1 density wave , and the b - ring outer edge have 1.5 and 1 as the typical values for the optical depth .",
    "further , @xmath79 is the typical optical depth value for the saturn s a ring , mimas 5:3 density wave and the janus 6:5 density wave .",
    "from ( [ eq : b1 ] ) , it is clear that the amplitude upper and lower bounds for the periodic solutions of @xmath99 vary log - linearly with @xmath100 and hence the corresponding curves in the plot are straight lines . it is interesting to note that the actual values for the maximum and minimum amplitudes ( obtained through simulations ) also appear to have a log - linear relationship with @xmath101 with the same slope as that of the upper and lower bounds . as a result , an exponential increase in @xmath101 causes an exponential decay in the mean aggregate mass of the ring particles .",
    "this effect can be understood as follows .",
    "large @xmath101 causes the rate of change of @xmath55 to be positive , and once @xmath102 ( same as @xmath103 in ( [ model3 ] ) ) , this causes a negative slope for @xmath104 and essentially causing the exponential decay of @xmath105 further , the parameter @xmath101 has a negligible effect on the amplitudes of @xmath106 as is evident from the negligible slope in the figure above .",
    "notice that both the axes are in log - scale and the plots for the lower - bound of @xmath82 does not appear in the plot because it takes negative values for all values of @xmath107    we see that the effect of changing @xmath108 only changes the magnitudes of maxima , minima , and the bounds on @xmath99 and @xmath109 otherwise , @xmath99 has a log - linear relationship with @xmath100 with the same slope for all values of @xmath108 . comparing figures [ fig : fstirfig1 ] - [ fig : fstirfig3 ] , the magnitudes of maxima @xmath99 increases with increase in @xmath110 and the minima decreases with increase in @xmath111 further , the magnitude of the maxima of @xmath82 remains unchanged with increase in @xmath108 and the magnitude of the minima decreases with increase in @xmath111 the physical interpretation is that larger optical depth leads to a larger mean aggregate mass , but not large velocity dispersion .",
    "this is because the velocity dispersion is pegged near the fixed point value given by the strong erosion for @xmath112 , which reverses the growth of @xmath99 .",
    "for the same reason , increasing @xmath113 reduces the upper value for @xmath99 .",
    "next , we study the impact of varying the forcing amplitude @xmath16 on the periodic solutions of @xmath92 , and figures [ fig : betafig1 ] - [ fig : betafig3 ] plot the maxima and minima of the @xmath27-periodic solution of the @xmath93 system obtained using numerical simulations against the derived upper and lower bounds for the @xmath27-periodic solution of the @xmath93 system from theorem [ th2 ] and theorem [ th3 ] .",
    "the system parameters are the same as before and the stirring period is assumed to be equal to the orbital period of the ring particles around saturn , in other words , @xmath114 .    notice that for small forcing amplitudes , the periodic solutions for @xmath99 and @xmath82 has a small amplitude about their average values , which in this case , are the asymptotically stable fixed points ( see remark [ rem : fixedpoint ] ) of the corresponding autonomous system of differential equations . with increase in @xmath115",
    "we see an increasing deviations in the amplitude of @xmath99 about the average values , while still non - negative , since the lower - bound from ( [ eq : b1 ] ) is non - negative .",
    "translating to the physical phenomena , the ring particle aggregates tend to achieve large masses as well as negligibly small masses , with increase in the forcing amplitude , in each period .",
    "the increase in forcing amplitudes causes a similar effect on @xmath82 as on @xmath99 . but increasing the forcing amplitude beyond a certain threshold causes @xmath82 to take negative values , which is non - physical .",
    "this sets a strict upper limit on the forcing amplitude , which in the case of the above figure , happens around @xmath116 comparing figure [ fig : betafig1 ] and [ fig : betafig3 ] , as @xmath108 increases from 0.5 to 1.5 , @xmath99 maxima increases , @xmath82 maxima changes only slightly .",
    "finally , notice that the upper and lower bounds for @xmath99 and @xmath82 are tight for small forcing amplitudes .",
    "this means that the behavior of the system is well - characterized by the bound derived in theorem [ th2 ] and theorem [ th3 ] for the regions in the saturn s ring system where the influence of the moons are negligible .",
    "the analytical results provide a reasonable idea about the nature of the system and parallel the explicit numerical simulations .",
    "we consider the mathematical model developed in @xcite for understanding the dynamics of certain specific locations in the saturn s ring system due to the periodic perturbations caused by the nearby moon .",
    "this model relates the mean aggregate mass and the velocity dispersion of the ring particles at a certain location in the saturn s ring system in a manner similar to the popular predator - prey model in ecology , although it represents a totally different physical phenomenon .",
    "further , this has been studied purely using numerical simulations so far .    in this paper",
    ", we conduct a rigorous mathematical analysis of the dynamical system and derive results pertaining to the existence , uniqueness and stability of its solution .",
    "we analytically prove that the dynamical system causes a periodic solution for the mean aggregate mass and the velocity dispersion of the ring particles at a period equal to the forcing period of the moon .",
    "further , upper and lower bounds for the solution to the system are derived , that are especially tight for small perturbations caused by the moons .",
