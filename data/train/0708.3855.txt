    "in many situations , it is useful to discretize continuous degrees of freedom to better understand them , both from a theoretical standpoint and for numerical efficiency . ising models are perhaps the best example of this and have been the subject of numerous theoretical and numerical studies .",
    "renormalization group arguments  @xcite have explained the reason why this discretization gives equilibrium critical properties of many experimental systems , and these kinds of arguments have been extended to understanding their equilibrium dynamics  @xcite . for non - equilibrium situations , such as the study of avalanches",
    ", such arguments probably do also apply to large enough length and time scales as well .",
    "however there are many situations where it would be desirable to understand smaller length scales where other factors should become relevant .",
    "this is particularly true with dynamics of magnetic systems , where damping is often weak in comparison to precessional effects . for studies of smaller scales",
    ", it has been necessary to use more time consuming micromagnetic simulations utilizing continuous degrees of freedom , such as the landau lifshitz gilbert equations  @xcite which is a kind of langevin equation that gives the stochastic evolution of heisenberg spins . @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a microscopic magnetic moment",
    ", @xmath2 is the local effective field , and @xmath3 is a damping factor , measuring the relative importance of damping to precession . in real materials it ranges",
    "@xcite from small damping @xmath4 , to @xmath5 .",
    "in contrast , the dynamical rules implemented for ising models are most often  relaxational \" so that energy is instantaneously dissipated when a spin flips , as with the metropolis algorithm .",
    "however there is a class of  microcanonical \" ising dynamics  @xcite reviewed in section [ sec : nonrelaxdyn ] where auxiliary degrees of freedom are introduced and all moves conserve the total energy .",
    "the other degrees of freedom can be taken to be variables associated with each spin , and allowed moves can change both the state of the spins and the auxiliary variables .",
    "this can be thought of crudely , as a discretized analogy to molecular dynamics , and is also similar to discrete lattice gas models of fluids  @xcite .",
    "these models give the correct equilibrium ising statistics of large systems and can also be used to understand dynamics in a different limit than the relaxational case .",
    "real spin systems are intermediate between these two kinds of dynamics and as mentioned above , are better described by langevin dynamics . in the context of spins ,",
    "the question posed and answered here is : how does one formulate a discrete time version of stochastic dynamics that includes damping and gives the correct equilibrium statistics ?",
    "in section [ subsec : extentodamping ] we are able to show that there is a fairly simple method for doing this using a combination of microcanonical dynamics , and an elegant procedure that incorporates damping and thermal noise .",
    "this procedure differs from that of the langevin equation in that it requires non - gaussian noise . despite this",
    ", the noise has surprisingly simple but unusual statistics .",
    "we will then show that this procedure gives the correct equilibrium statistics and verify this numerical in section [ subsec : eqtests ] with a simulation of the two dimensional ising model with different amounts of damping .    because the value of damping is an important physical parameter in many situations it is important that there is a straightforward way of incorporating its effects in ising simulations .",
    "this is particularly noteworthy as ising kinetics are a frequently used means of understanding dynamics in many condensed matter systems .",
    "after this in section [ subsec : avaldyn ] we will turn to nonequilibrium problems where , using this approach , we can study the effects of damping on a number of interesting properties of systems displaying avalanches and barkhausen noise  @xcite .",
    "we first show how to modify the kinetics for this case and then study systems in two and three dimensions . with modest amounts of computer time",
    ", we can analyze problems that are out of the reach of micromagnetic simulations and allow us to probe the effects of damping on the properties of avalanches .",
    "this is related to recent work  @xcite by the present authors using both the landau lifshitz gilbert equation , eqn .",
    "[ eq : llg ] , and theoretical approaches , to understand how relaxational dynamics of avalanches  @xcite , are modified at small to intermediate scales by this more realistic approach . with the present approach",
    "we find new features and modifications of avalanche dynamics .",
    "we find that the shape of hysteresis loops can be strongly influenced by the amount of damping .",
    "one of the most striking findings is that there exists a parameter regime of high disorder and small damping where single system - size avalanches occur that are made up of a large number of disconnected pieces .",
    "we can also analyze the critical properties of avalanches when damping is small and give evidence that there is a crossover length scale , below which avalanches have different critical properties .",
    "we start by considering a model for a magnet with continuous degrees of freedom , such as a heisenberg model with anisotropy .",
    "the ising approximation simplifies the state of each spin to either up or down , that is @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "one important effect that is ignored by this approximation is that of spin waves that allow the transfer of energy between neighbors , and for small oscillations , give an energy contribution per spin equal to the temperature @xmath8 ( here we set @xmath9 ) .",
    "this motivates the idea that there are extra degrees of freedom associated with every spin that can carry ( a positive ) energy @xmath10 .",
    "creutz introduced such degrees of freedom  @xcite and posited that they could take any number of discrete values .",
    "he used these auxiliary variables @xmath10 to construct a cellular automota to give the correct equilibrium statistics for the ising model , in a very efficient way that did not require the generation of random numbers .",
    "thus we have a hamiltonian @xmath11 that is the sum of both spin @xmath12 and auxiliary degrees of freedom @xmath13 : @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath12 can be a general ising spin hamiltonian and @xmath15 . in our model",
    "there is a single auxiliary variable @xmath10 associated with each lattice site @xmath16 , that can take on any real value @xmath17 .",
    "however for the purposes of trying to model dynamics of spins , it also makes sense to allow the @xmath10 s to interact and exchange energy between neighbors .",
    "for example , one precessing spin should excite motion in its neighbors .",
    "this exchange was formulated in the context of solidification using a potts model instead of an ising model by conti _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , but can equally well be used here .",
    "now we can formulate a microcanonical algorithm for the ising model using a procedure very similar to their prescription . in each step :    * we choose a site @xmath16 at random .",
    "* we randomly pick with equal probability either a spin or an auxiliary degree of freedom , @xmath18 of @xmath10 : * * @xmath18 s : we attempt to move spins ( such as the flipping of a single spin ) .",
    "if the energy cost in doing this is @xmath19 we perform the move and decrease @xmath10 accordingly .",
    "otherwise we reject the move . * * @xmath10 s : we pick a nearest neighbor @xmath20 , and repartition the total energy with uniform probability between these two variables .",
    "that is , after repartitioning , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is uniform random variable .",
    "note that these rules preserve the total energy and the transitions between any two states have the same probability .",
    "therefore this will give the correct microcanonical distribution .",
    "for large @xmath24 , this is , for most purposes  @xcite , equivalent to the canonical distribution @xmath25 .",
    "note that the probability distribution for each variable @xmath10 , @xmath26 , so that the @xmath27 .",
    "that is , measurement of average of @xmath10 s directly gives the effective temperature of the system .",
    "the question we asked , is how to extend this equilibrium simulation method to include damping . in this case",
    "the system is no longer closed and energy is exchanged with an outside heat bath through interaction with the auxiliary variables . as with the langevin equation , there are two effects .",
    "the first is that the energy is damped .",
    "call the dissipation parameter for each step @xmath28 , which will lie between @xmath29 and @xmath5 . then at each time step we lower the energy with @xmath30 for all sites @xmath16 . by itself , this clearly will not give a system at finite temperature and we must also include the second effect of a heat bath , which adds energy randomly to the system . in the case of the langevin equation , a gaussian noise term @xmath31 is added to keep the system at finite temperature",
    ". a discretized version of this , that evolves the energy @xmath32 at time step @xmath33 is @xmath34 this equation will not work if the noise @xmath31 is gaussian as this does not give the gibbs distribution @xmath35 .",
    "therefore we need to modify the statistics of @xmath31 .",
    "it is possible to do so if we choose @xmath31 at each time @xmath33 from a distribution @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the heaviside step function . to show this , we write down the corresponding equation for the evolution of the probability distribution for @xmath38 :    @xmath39",
    "we require that the @xmath40 as @xmath41 obeys @xmath42 , for @xmath43 .",
    "it is easily verified that by choosing this form of @xmath44 and by choosing @xmath45 as in eq .",
    "[ eq : p(n ) ] , we satisfy eq .",
    "[ eq : evolofp ] .    therefore to add damping to this model , we add the following procedure to the steps stated above :    * choose a uniform random number @xmath23 .",
    "if @xmath46 , then @xmath47 . otherwise @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is another uniform random number between @xmath29 and @xmath5 .",
    "if we assume that the probability distribution for the total system is of the form @xmath50 , we will now show that the steps 1 , 2 , and 3 , of this algorithm preserve this distribution .",
    "following the same reasoning as above for the microcanonical simulation , moves implementing steps 1 and 2 do not change the total energy , and they preserve the form of @xmath51 because @xmath51 depends only on the total energy ( @xmath11 ) , and 1 and 2 explore each state in an energy shell with uniform probability . because of the form of @xmath51 , its dependence on the variable @xmath10 is @xmath52 . according to the above argument , after step 3",
    ", it will remain unchanged . therefore all steps in this algorithm leave @xmath51 unchanged .",
    "the algorithm is also ergodic , and therefore this will converge to the gibbs distribution  @xcite as @xmath41 .",
    "because the steps each preserve the gibbs distribution , the ordering of them is not important in preserving equilibrium statistics .",
    "for example , we could sweep through the lattice sequentially instead of picking @xmath16 at random .",
    "we could perform step 3 after steps 1 and 2 were performed @xmath24 times .",
    "we performed tests on this algorithm and verified that it did indeed work as expected .",
    "we simulated the two dimensional ising model on a @xmath53 lattice with different values of the damping parameter , and compared it with the exact results .",
    "the average magnetization per spin @xmath54 is plotted in fig .",

    "the @xmath55 s are the case @xmath56 , which is then just an implementation of the microcanonical method  @xcite described above . in this case , the temperature was obtained by measuring @xmath57 because the energy was fixed at the start of the simulation .",

    "the system is taken to be at @xmath75 , so that only moves that lower the energy are accepted .",
    "the flipping of one spin can cause a cascade of additional spins to flip , causing the total magnetization @xmath76 to further decrease .",

    "there is a critical value of @xmath20 where the distribution of avalanche sizes is a power law and self - similar scaling behavior is observed .",
    "here we investigate how this is modified by adding damping to these zero temperature dynamics according to the following rules :    * the field is slowly lowered by finding the next field where a spin can flip . * the spins then flip , exchanging energy with auxiliary variables @xmath10 as described above .",

    "<S> we show for the ising model that is possible construct a discrete time stochastic model analogous to the langevin equation that incorporates an arbitrary amount of damping . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown to give the correct equilibrium statistics and is then used to investigate nonequilibrium phenomena , in particular , magnetic avalanches . </S>",
    "<S> the value of damping can greatly alter the shape of hysteresis loops , and for small damping and high disorder , the morphology of large avalanches can be drastically effected . </S>",
