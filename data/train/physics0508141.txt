    "chirps are periodic signals with an instantaneous frequency changing in time .",
    "chirps are produced by a variety of sources : from lightning generated whistlers @xcite to the acoustic emission of bats @xcite and whales @xcite .",
    "recently the presence of chirps in infrasound recording has been associated with the occurrence of sprites over thunderstorm clouds @xcite .",
    "several methods of chirp detection have been developed , operating in both the time domain ( multiple frequency tracker @xcite and recursive least square algorithm @xcite ) and the frequency domain ( page s test @xcite and hough transform @xcite ) .    in this work",
    "we introduce two new methods for chirp detection . the spectral covariance detector and the cassandra detector .",
    "the spectral covariance detector operates in the frequency domain and uses the correlation between different frequency bins of the spectrogram @xcite as an indicator of the chirp occurrence .",
    "the cassandra ( _ complex analysis of sequences via scaling and randomness assessment _ ) detector operates in the time domain @xcite and uses diffusion entropy analysis @xcite .",
    "we study the performance of these two detectors and compare the results with a standard signal to noise ratio detector ( standard deviation detector ) .",
    "sprites @xcite and other recently discovered transient luminous events ( tles ) above thunderstorm clouds , such as elves @xcite , blue jets @xcite and gigantic jets @xcite are the subject of intense research @xcite .",
    "tles connect the lower layer of the atmosphere ( troposphere : below @xmath3 km ) where the weather activity occurs with the upper levels of the atmosphere ( 80 - 100 km ) .",
    "knowledge of the sprite occurrence rate is of primary interest to address the relevance of these phenomena and their global impact on the atmosphere .",
    "the outline of this work is the following . in section [ sprite ]",
    "we briefly discuss the infrasound signature of sprites . in section [ detectors ]",
    "we discuss the details of each detector and its performance in sprite detection . in section [ conclusion ]",
    "we draw our conclusions .",
    "sprites are tles with a typical duration from a few milliseconds up to a few hundred milliseconds .",
    "they are generated by the electric field pulse of a `` parent '' positive cloud - to - ground ( + cg ) lightning discharge @xcite .",
    "the vertical extension of sprites is @xmath445 km , starting from @xmath440 km up to @xmath485 km , while their horizontal extension can range from 20 - 50 km .",
    "since the first optical observations @xcite , sprites have been observed over thunderstorm clouds in north america @xcite , europe @xcite and japan @xcite .",
    "electromagnetic signatures from sprites have been reported in the extremely - low frequency ( elf ) range ( 10hz-3khz ) @xcite and with earth - ionosphere cavity resonances @xcite .",
    "the possibility that sprites could generate an infrasound signature was first suggested by lizska @xcite .",
    "the first report of sprite signature is by @xcite .",
    "the sprite signatures are located in the 1 - 10 hz frequency range and in many cases a linear chirp of increasing frequency with time is observed .",
    "this signature is caused by the spatial extent of the sprite ( from 20 to 50 km ) @xcite , its orientation with respect to the infrasound station , and the reflectivity properties of the thermosphere @xcite .",
    "pressure waves generated from different regions of the sprite will be reflected at different altitudes in the thermosphere with different absorption and dispersion properties before reaching the infrasound station .",
    "the net result is that pressure waves coming from the nearest end of the sprite will arrive first at the station with a low frequency content .",
    "pressure waves coming from the farthest end of the sprite will arrive later at the station with a high frequency content .",
    "sprite signatures which show an impulsive feature instead of a chirp , are the result of a small spatial extension or of the alignment with the infrasound station ( regardless of spatial extent ) .",
    "the data set used to test the automated chirp detectors is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "it is the original signal recorded with a 20 hz sampling rate at the infrasound station in flers ( 210 km west of paris , france ) from 2:30 ut to 4:00 ut on the 21st of july 2003 . during this hour and",
    "half an intense thunderstorm occurred in central france .",
    "optical observations reported 28 sprites in the thunderstorm region .",
    "from these 28 sprites , 12 signatures were detected in the infrasound recording , @xmath5 signatures were chirps with an average duration @xmath6@xmath412 - 15 seconds as identified by visual inspection .",
    "the sprite signatures are not visible in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] because their intensity is very small compared to those of the slow pressure ( @xmath7@xmath81 hz ) fluctuations caused by the wind .",
    "but the spectrogram in the range @xmath9 hz as in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] shows the chirp signature of a sprite .",
    "therefore before applying any detection method , we high pass filter the infrasound recording in order to eliminate the very slow wind fluctuations ( @xmath7@xmath81 hz ) .",
    "the performance of an automated detector operating with a threshold @xmath10 is measured by the detection efficiency @xmath11 and by the false alarm rate @xmath12 .",
    "the number of sprites occurring @xmath13 can be obtained from the number of sprites detected @xmath14 by @xmath15 the ideal detector has a threshold @xmath10 with no false alarm rate ( @xmath16 ) and perfect detection efficiency ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "this implies @xmath18 .",
    "the optimal threshold @xmath10 is the best compromise between detection efficiency and false alarm rate .",
    "a threshold with zero false alarm rate and a small detection efficiency is not desirable because it means that only rare events are detected ( perfect chirp signals unaffected by noise ) . in this case",
    "the number of detected occurrences are affected by noise .",
    "the same is true for a perfect detection efficiency but a large false alarm rate where many detections result from signatures other than chirps .",
    "therefore we investigate the properties of the detection efficiency ( de ) and the false alarm rate ( fa ) as a function of the threshold @xmath10 for each detector .",
    "the standard deviation detector detects a chirp when the signal intensity exceeds a given threshold .",
    "we calculate the signal intensity changes in the high pass filtered infrasound recording , by moving a window of length @xmath19 through the data and evaluating at each time the standard deviation of the data inside the window .",
    "we choose @xmath20 data points .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath21 seconds long time interval : a time interval in the expected range of the average duration ( @xmath6@xmath412 - 15 s ) of a sprite chirp signature .",
    "the variation of the standard deviation is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] .",
    "the horizontal line indicates the threshold @xmath22 pa . , while the bottom diagonal line indicates the long term trend of the standard deviation .",
    "the intensity follows the day - night cycle of temperature , with a maximum around noon and a minimum around midnight . in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] the intensity slowly increases as the sun rise approaches at 4:00 ut .    a detector based on the standard deviation should continuously scale the threshold to take in account the effect of change of intensity in time or particularly windy conditions .",
    "here we use the standard deviation detector for comparison with the spectral covariance detector and the cassandra detector .",
    "therefore we use a constant threshold for the entire duration ( 2 hours ) of the infrasound recording .    fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] shows the detection effieciency and the false alarm rate for different values of the threshold @xmath10 .",
    "it is evident that the standard deviation detector has no good compromise between false alarm rate and detection efficiency . for values of @xmath23",
    "we have a detection efficiency ( de @xmath24 0.6 or 60@xmath25 ) but a false alarm rate ( fa @xmath24 0.75 or 75@xmath25 ) .",
    "raising the threshold lowers the false alarm rate to about 0.6 ( 60@xmath25 ) but the detection efficiency decreases to less than 0.3 ( 30@xmath25 ) .",
    "these results for the standard deviation detector are not surprising : every chirp signature implies an increase in the signal to noise ratio but the inverse conjecture is not true .",
    "the spectral covariance detector rests on the application of the spectral covariance of the spectrogram to detect chirp signatures of increasing frequency ( fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ) . in this section ,",
    "we introduce the spectral covariance and discuss the performance of the spectral covariance detector for the infrasound chirp signatures of sprites .",
    "the spectrogram of a signal is its energy density @xmath26 in the time - frequency plane .",
    "a linear chirp of increasing frequency will appear as a diagonal line in the spectrogram ( fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ) .",
    "the inclination of the line with respect the horizontal axis is proportional to the rate @xmath27 at which the frequency of the chirp changes in time .",
    "the spectral covariance uses the covariance between the energy density @xmath26 relative to two different frequencies to detect the presence of a diagonal line in the spectrogram .",

    "( [ cov ] ) for detecting linear chirps with a variable frequency range we need to eliminate its dependence on a particular frequency @xmath7 without loosing the useful properties in chirp detection .",
    "thus we average the covariance over all frequencies and define the spectral covariance of delay @xmath28 and frequency shift @xmath32 as @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the frequency average .",
    "the delay @xmath45 for which the spectral covariance of eq .",

    "the spectral covariance detector operates as follows .",

[ aggregation ] ) .",

    ",    finally , in fig .  [ figure10 ]",
    "we plot the the detection efficiency and the false alarm rate for different values of the threshold @xmath10 .",
    "the cassandra detector has a good compromise between the false alarm rate and the detection efficiency . for a threshold value of 0.8",
    "the false alarm rate is null and the detection efficiency is about 66% .",
    "the plots of the detection efficiency and false alarm rate as a function of the threshold @xmath10 ( figs .",
    "[ figure4 ] , [ figure7 ] and [ figure10 ] ) indicate that the cassandra detector is the one with the best trade off between detection efficiency and false alarm rate .",

    "we see how raising the threshold @xmath10 in the case of the standard deviation detector ( panel ( a ) ) does not lower the false alarm rate . for the spectral covariance detector we would expect to get a better false alarm rate lowering the threshold , but this is not the case ( panel ( b ) ) .",
