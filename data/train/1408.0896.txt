    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) are characterised by electromagnetic emission across a wide spectral range , which is generated by several different emission mechanisms such as ( thermal ) bremsstrahlung , synchrotron and inverse compton scattering ( ic ) , and the line emission of many different chemical elements in various ionisation levels ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "similar processes play an important role in many other astrophysical objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . consequently , the spectra and lightcurves depend on many physical processes , some of which can be  within a broad range of uncertainties  inferred from observational data ( explosion energy , properties of the environment . unfortunately , there are other key processes which may be not fully understood such as the physics of radiative shocks and the associated particle acceleration . furthermore , many snrs show a complex geometry with deviations from spherical symmetry that may be attributed to combinations of asymmetries in the explosion , instabilities during the propagation of the shock wave such as rayleigh - taylor , vishniac ( thin shell ) or unstable cooling ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , inhomogeneities in the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) , or magnetic fields . for a review on observations of snrs , we refer to @xcite . among the galactic remnants , snr rx j0852.0 - 4622  ( vela jr . )",
    "is a particularly interesting case , with observations from radio to tev energies revealing a complex emission geometry @xcite .",
    "the complexity of the radiation processes and the hydrodynamics of the snr restrict a straightforward interpretation of observations and require the use of increasingly complex models in order to understand the physics of snrs in general and of individual objects . depending on the objective",
    ", models may focus on different effects , while making simplification in other sectors of physics .",
    "for instance , @xcite performed a series of three - dimensional simulations of the expansion of supernova blast waves into a clumpy environment ( for models of simular settings , see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . paying attention in particular to the case of vela jr . , they concentrated their efforts on an accurate modelling of the hydrodynamics of the interaction between the shock wave and clouds in the ism . their model for the electromagnetic emission , on the other hand , was relatively limited and accounted only for thermal bremsstrahlung , leaving out some of the most important contributions to the emission coming from snrs .",
    "our goal now is to remedy this limitation by modelling the non - thermal emission of the simulated snrs . to this end , we propose a method for post - processing the existing simulations .",
    "we assume that particle acceleration at the shock wave generates a population of high - energy electrons that subsequently cool by synchrotron and inverse - compton radiation .",
    "the advantage of our approach is that it can provide and quick estimate of the non - thermal emission , but at a cost of several simplifications w.r.t .",
    ", e.g.  the spectra of the shock - accelerated electrons , the seed photons for ic , and the magnetic field in the snr .",
    "furthermore , we neglect ionisation and line emission .",
    "@xcite used similar methods to interpret observations of the vela jr .",
    "snr , but coupled the emission model to spherically symmetric analytic hydrodynamical models , whereas we will use self - consistent hydrodynamical simulations to determine the evolution of the shock wave .",
    "our method is , however , less accurate than , e.g.  the simulations of @xcite , which couple hydrodynamics , non - equilibrium ionisation , non - linear diffuse shock acceleration , and cosmic - ray production in a fully self - consistent manner .",
    "we also refer to the work of @xcite for computations of the non - thermal emission in snrs based on multi - dimensional simulations .",
    "we additionally note that our approach is at an approximate level related to the relativistic emission modelling of @xcite and @xcite . by virtue of its simplicity",
    ", the method lends itself easily to an investigation of the impact of variation of the input physics , e.g.  of the spectra of accelerated electrons or the seed photons for the ic process .",
    "we will begin the presentation in this article with a brief recap of the hydrodynamical simulations of @xcite and an outline of our emission model in sect.[sek : physnum ] , then present results for the non - thermal radiation emitted by one of the models ( sect.[sek : res ] ) , before summarising the main results and drawing further conclusions in sect.[sek : sum ] .",
    "following the implementation in the spev code outlined in @xcite , we model the evolution of a population of non - thermal electrons accelerated by the shock wave and their subsequent emission of synchrotron and ic radiation using the post - processing algorithm _ spevita _ based on three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "such a two - step approach requires that the radiative energy losses do not significantly alter the structure and evolution of the remnant .",
    "this condition is satisfied in our cases because the total amount of energy carried away by photons is small w.r.t .  the total kinetic and internal energy of the remnant .",
    "we furthermore work in the limit of low optical depth of the gas in the snr .",
    "this assumption is justified by the low gas density . if we estimate the optical depth of the snr using the thomson scattering cross section , @xmath0 , we find that even the densest clouds in our simulations ( densities up to @xmath1 , size up to 10 pc ) have optical depths of less than 0.01 , and most of the gas is much more optically thin .",
    "this fact allows us to directly obtain the radiation arriving at an observer location from the emissivity at the source location instead of solving the much more complex equations of radiative transfer .",
    "furthermore , we neglect synchrotron self - absorption since it is unimportant in the frequencies considered here ( above the optical band ) .    [ [ hydrodynamical - models ] ] hydrodynamical models + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    from the simulations of @xcite , we select a model ( model ` s25a ` ) in which a bipolar supernova explosion ejects a mass of @xmath2 with a total explosion energy of @xmath3 into an ism of particle density @xmath4 and temperature @xmath5 .",
    "the ism contains four large high - density clouds placed in the nw , n , se and s directions from the the centre of the explosion at positions where x - ray bright features are suggestive of an interaction between the shock wave and overdense structures in the ism .",
    "the expanding shock wave roughly maintains its initial bipolar shape with an interior consisting of a hot , tenuous gas with very little substructure .",
    "this changes once , after a time of about @xmath6 , the interaction between the shock wave and the clouds channels the expanding gas between the gas clouds and enhances the mixing of post - shock fluid elements . on the time",
    "scales under consideration here , i.e.  up to 1500 years after the explosion , the clouds are not disrupted by the shock , but experience considerable deformation and , most importantly , heating of the shocked surfaces , which , as a combination of high temperature and high density , show up as prominent emitters of thermal radiation .",

    "the following conditions allow us to fix these three parameters :    1 .",

    "3 .   given @xmath17 ,",
    "the normalisation @xmath24 and the minimum lorentz factor are direct functions of the efficiency of the acceleration process , i.e.  the fraction of electrons accelerated in the shock wave and the fraction of total energy they carry , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .    in practise",
    ", we ignore all electrons below @xmath27 when computing synchrotron and ic emission to be consistent with the approximations we will employ in their respective emissivities .",

    "the power - law index of the non - thermal electrons was set to @xmath79 .",
    "the synchrotron emission then follows directly from the settings for the magnetic field .",
    "we represent the seed for ic scattering by a simple model for the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , viz .  a field of photons of temperature @xmath80 with a uniform energy density of @xmath81 .",
    "we show the spectral energy distribution of the radiation emitted by the shock - accelerated electrons at four different times in fig.[fig : refmod - spec ] .",
    "synchrotron radiation dominates the total radiative output at low energies with a broad peak in the range of uv to x - ray energies .",
    "the spectral indices and the cutoff frequencies of both components of the emission show little evolution with time , and consequently the spectra at different times have rather similar shapes .",
    "we find , on the other hand , considerable differences in the luminosities with time .",
    "the synchrotron radiation increases from @xmath82 and is greatest at @xmath83 , before it gradually decreases again . for times",
    "@xmath83 and @xmath84 , our results agree very well with the radio observations .",
    "for all times , the asca data lie in the steeply declining part of the synchrotron spectrum .",
    "the ic contribution is , in contrast to synchrotron , increasing steadily throughout the entire simulation time , though the brightening seems to slow down as we go from @xmath84 to @xmath85 . during this period ,",
    "our results roughly match the observational data points .",
    "the main discrepancy is that our models do not reproduce the rather broad shape of the observed ic maximum . assuming a thermal distribution of cmb seed photons rather than the monochromatic spectrum we used might bring our results closer to the observations .",
    "we investigate the evolving appearance of the snr in the series of emission maps presented in fig.[fig : refmod - maps ] . before hitting the four major clouds ( _ top _ panels )",
    ", the expanding shock wave maintains its ellipsoidal shape , and consequently the observational display of the snr at low and high photon energies is dominated by the limb - brightened shock wave .",

    "the non - thermal particles cool rather rapidly , and , hence , the interior regions of the snr behind the shock wave remain dark .",

    "( _ bottom _ panels ) , the shock wave has already crossed the four main clouds , which now show up as additional emitters , in particular in the x - ray band .",
    "this enhanced emission reflects the rather high particle density and pressure at the shock - heated cloud surface as well as the reduced velocities in the flow hitting the cloud , where the fluid remains trapped for a fairly long time , thus reducing the adiabatic cooling of the non - thermal electrons .    we compare the results of the eight additional models in which we vary one input parameter at a time in fig.[fig : parsvars ] .",

    "the spectra , all taken at the same time , @xmath86 , indicate how the choice of input physics affects the results :    * the acceleration parameter , @xmath74 ( blue lines ) , by virtue of setting the maximum lorentz factor of the electrons , strongly modifies the cutoff frequencies of both synchrotron and ic emission .",
    "changing the value by one order of magnitude to higher ( @xmath87 ) or lower ( @xmath88 ) values reduces or increases the cutoff energies by approximately two orders of magnitude , but leaves the rising parts of the spectrum basically unchanged .",
    "in particular , both spectra still go through the radio data points . * the parameter @xmath26 ( green lines ) setting the total fraction of the energy that goes into non - thermal particles",
    "is directly reflected in the normalisation of the spectra at all photon energies .",
    "it does , on the other hand , not have any impact on the high - energy cutoff .",
    "both spectra with higher and lower values match the data considerably worse than our reference simulation does .",
    "* the number fraction of accelerated electron , @xmath25 ( red lines ) , has a comparably little influence on the spectra .",
    "the effect of lowering or rising its value has the opposite effect of lowering or rising @xmath26 : distributing the same amount of energy among more or less accelerated electrons leads to slightly lower or higher spectral power , respectively . *",
    "the magnetisation of the medium , @xmath19 ( orange lines ) , affects the spectra in a more complex way than the other three parameters .",
    "the magnetic field plays a role in setting the maximum energy of the electrons , and , most importantly , it directly determines the synchrotron losses .",
    "stronger magnetic field ( @xmath89 ) translates into a brighter synchrotron emission .",
    "consequently , the electrons cool faster , which leads to a much weaker ic emission , in particular at high energies . setting @xmath90",

    "explaining the radiation observed in many galactic snrs , characterised by non - thermal emission across a very broad band of photon energies as well as by a complex geometry , requires an approach combining multi - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations and a detailed modelling of the non - thermal radiation processes . to this end",
    ", we have adapted the methods used previously for computing the non - thermal emission of relativistic outflows to the situation of multi - dimensional non - relativistic snrs expanding into a clumpy ism .",
    "a fraction of the electrons in the gas are accelerated to extremely relativistic energies when the shock wave passes across a fluid element and they subsequently emit synchrotron and inverse - compton radiation .",
    "we apply a simple post - processing tool , _ spevita _ , based on the relativistic code spev @xcite .",
    "we follow the evolution of lagrangian tracer particles advected with the flow . upon passage of the shock wave",
    ", we set up a power - law distribution of the electrons .",
    "starting from these initial states , we evolve the distribution taking into account adiabatic compression / expansion by the flow and energy losses due to synchrotron and ic radiation .",
    "we finally compute the detailed spectra of these two radiative processes by integrating the corresponding emissivities for all tracer particles . from these ,",
    "we can straightforwardly obtain , e.g.  spectra or two - dimensional emission maps .",
    "our method is less elaborate than , e.g.  the scheme of @xcite treating diffusive shock acceleration self - consistently .",
    "therefore , as a first main step , we assessed its applicability in snr models by computing a small set of emission models based on the same hydrodynamical simulation and varying some of the free parameters of the physics of non - thermal particles and their emission .",
    "we selected one of the three - dimensional simulations by @xcite , consisting of an energetic bipolar explosion expanding into an ism containing several large clouds .",
    "although this particular hydrodynamical model was designed as a possible scenario for the observational appearance of snr rx j0852.0 - 4622  ( vela jr . ) , we do not intend to match the observational data of this or any other individual snr here .",
    "we do , however , try to roughly reproduce the main features characteristic of most snr .",
    "the results of this first set of models show a reasonable quantitative agreement with the data of the vela jr .  snr .",
    "in particular , we clearly find the broad - band non - thermal emission with peaks in the uv - to - x - ray and gev - to - tev energies , produced by synchrotron and inverse - compton scattering , with fluxes that are of the right order of magnitude .",
    "geometrically , the emission is dominated by the immediate post - shock region . in addition",
    ", large clouds hit by the shock wave , can show up prominently , in particular in soft x - ray bands , after the shock wave has swept across them .    instead of using different hydrodynamic models",
    ", we varied the parameters that govern our model for the acceleration and emission of non - thermal electrons , viz .  the acceleration efficiencies , the relative energy and number densities of the accelerated particlces , and the magnetisation .",
    "most of these changes yield a significantly worse agreement with the observational data , which suggests that we might use future , more detailed models to constrain their likely values in snrs , in particular if the remaining potential degeneracies can be reduced by complimentary observations , e.g. , of the magnetic field in the vicinity of the explosion .",
    "having found a qualitative agreement between models and general observational features of snrs , we plan to extend the present analysis by considering a wider range of physical parameters for the acceleration and emission processes and apply it to a larger set of ( magneto-)hydrodynamical simulations in order to investigate the observational consequences of different sources for asymmetries in snrs .",
