    "in microscopic - macroscopic treatments of nuclear fission @xcite , the whole nuclear system is characterized by some collective coordinates associated with some degrees of freedom that determine approximately the behavior of many intrinsic variables .",
    "the basic ingredients in such an analysis is a shape parametrization that depends on several macroscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "the generalized coordinates of deformation vary in time leading to a split of the nuclear system in two separated fragments .",
    "thus , these coordinates describe the change in time of the average field .",
    "traditionally , in the large amplitude collective motion like fission or fusion , the calculation of the mass parameters are made within the cranking model @xcite .",
    "these parameters are calculated adiabatically . in reality , the nucleus can be excited with respect the ground state at any deformation . the excitation energy is shared between the collective kinetic energy of the fragments and the intrinsic energy released finally through gamma - ray and neutron emission . as mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , no unique separation between these two kind of dumping can be realized .",
    "several attempts were realized in order to investigate the change of the cranking mass parameters as function of the intrinsic excitation energy . in this respect ,",
    "investigation based on the cranking model have been done for the rotational motion @xcite and for the behavior of the temperature dependent mass parameter @xcite . a theory for non - adiabatic cranking",
    "was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite where the time - dependent many - body schrodinger equation is solved and the time dependence of the collective motion is determined with the classical lagrange equation of motion .",
    "it is worth to mention that in ref .",
    "@xcite an expression is derived for the collective kinetic energy containing corrections up to the fourth - order in the collective velocities .",
    "the fourth - corrections to the cranking approximation at hyperdeformations were found very large .",
    "the authors concluded that the perturbation treatment when applied to fission is invalidated .    in this paper , a new treatment for the cranking model",
    "is realized that takes into account the intrinsic excitation energy . in the next section ,",
    "a semi - adiabatic cranking approximation is derived for even - even systems to investigate the general features of the cranking mass parameters when the nucleus is internally excited . to make the problem tractable",
    ", it is assumed that the system deforms slowly in time .",
    "therefore , the matrix elements of the time - derivative of the wave functions are smalls .",
    "because these matrix elements are responsible for quasi - particle excitations , our approximation allows to consider the system in a seniority - zero state during fission . in other words ,",
    "the contributions to the inertia originating from seniority - two configurations are considered negligible . in section [ sect3 ] ,",
    "the mass parameters are calculated . to obtain the inertia , a least action trajectory for the evolution of the nuclear system",
    "is determined .",
    "the single - particle energies for protons and neutrons were calculated along this path .",
    "then , the intrinsic excitation energy of the fissioning system is evaluated within the time - dependent pairing equations of motion using different values of the inter - nuclear velocities . at each deformation ,",
    "instantaneous values of the single - particle densities and of the pairing moment components are deduced .",
    "the semi - adiabatic effective mass is evaluated using these values .",
    "some behavior concerning the dependence of the cranking mass parameters versus the intrinsic excitation energy are extracted . in the last section , a discussion is made .",
    "the single particle motion of a particle in an average field is governed by the schrdinger equation that includes a hamiltonian with pairing residual interactions .",
    "this hamiltonian depends on some time - dependent collective parameters @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , such as the internuclear distances between the nascent fragments , the mass - asymmetry , the fragment deformations or the necking parameter : @xmath3(a_{k}^{+}a_{k}+a_{\\bar k}^{+}a_{\\bar k})-g\\sum_{k , i>0}a_{k}^{+}a_{\\bar{k}}^{+ } a_{i}a_{\\bar{i}}. \\label{ham1}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 are single - particle energies , @xmath5 is an monopole pairing interaction constant and @xmath6 denote creation operators . in order to obtain the time dependent pairing equations of motion",
    ", we shall start from the variational principle taking the following energy functional @xmath7 and by assuming the many - body state formally expanded as a superposition of time dependent bcs seniority - zero and seniority - two adiabatic wave functions @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the seniority - zero bogoliubov wave function .",
    "the excited seniority - two configurations are obtained by mean of quasiparticle creation and annihilation operators : @xmath10 in definitions ( [ expr0 ] ) and ( [ wf2 ] ) , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are amplitudes of the two kinds of configurations , @xmath13 is the chemical potential , and @xmath14 is the particle number operator . because only the relative phase between the parameters @xmath15 ( vacancy amplitudes ) and @xmath16 ( occupation amplitudes ) matters , in the following @xmath15 is considered to be a real quantity and @xmath17 a complex one . to minimize the functional , the expression ( [ expr0 ] )",
    "is derived with respect the independent variables @xmath16 , @xmath16 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ( the amplitudes of the wave function ) , together with their complex conjugates , and the resulting equations are set to zero .    as deduced in refs .",
    "@xcite and as detailed in the appendix , for a seniority - zero nuclear system , the pairing equations of motion are : @xmath18 this system is sometimes called time dependent hartree - fock - bogoliubov equations @xcite .",
    "these equations were already used to determine the intrinsic excitation energy in fission @xcite or to investigate the pair - breaking mechanism @xcite .",
    "the following notations are used in eqs .",
    "( [ hfb ] ) and in the remaining part of the article : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the gap parameter for the seniority - zero state while @xmath21 are related to seniority - two states .",
    "@xmath22 are pairing moment components and @xmath23 are single particle densities .    an estimate of the intrinsic seniority - zero state excitation energy @xcite can be obtained with the relation @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the expected value of the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) for the seniority - zero state and @xmath26 is the stationary energy obtained by replacing @xmath22 and @xmath23 within the time - independent bcs parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 in formula ( [ uiy ] ) .    as indicated in the appendix ,",

    "that means , the term ( [ sec ] ) is practically independent on the collective velocity and depends only on the values of @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , that is on the structure of the system and its intrinsic excitation and represents the minimal collective kinetic energy .",
    "therefore , the term ( [ sec ] ) can be viewed as an ground collective kinetic energy . in other words , if the nucleus is internally excited and the derivatives of the probabilities @xmath52 , @xmath53 are different from zero , the system possesses a minimal collective kinetic energy",
    ". the term ( [ sec ] ) can be considered as responsible for energy transfer between intrinsic and collective degrees of freedom .",
    "the calculation addresses the fission of @xmath0u .",
    "as already mentioned , the basic ingredient in our analysis is the nuclear shape parametrization .",
    "the nuclear shape parametrization used in the following is given by two ellipsoids of different sizes smoothly joined by a third surface obtained @xcite by the rotation of a circle around the axis of symmetry .",
