    "technological progress allowing the manipulation of ratchet effects in complex systems such as cold atoms @xcite , colloids @xcite , cells @xcite , fluids @xcite , electrons in semiconductors @xcite , extended magnetic walls @xcite , vortices in josephson systems @xcite , motivate this work . in all the mentioned examples the flux of driven particles interact with an asymmetric potential .",
    "the key question on this field is that _ it is not simple _ in each case to know feasibly which are the mechanisms underlying these many bodies rectification effects .",
    "it is well known that the velocity of a single overdamped particle under an applied ac force can be rectified by introducing a periodic potential with broken reflection symmetry @xcite .",
    "we can thus ask whether this effect , known as rocking ratchet ( because the system is rocked with an external ac force ) , can be still observed as a rectified dc voltage response in transport measurements in singly connected mesoscopic superconductors under external ac bias currents , thermal fluctuations and external homogenous magnetic field applied .",
    "indeed finite dc voltage was measured under zero averaged ac current applied and it was extensively studied in superconducting ( sc ) nanostructures @xcite .",
    "but this system differs from examples mentioned previously , because the essential broken symmetry required to obtain a rectifier is controlled differently in these samples , it is controlled by its geometry ( sample shape ) and the configuration of contacts leads ( position of the current / voltage probes ) .",
    "in particular , motivated by these recent experiments reporting original voltage rectification effects in mesoscopic superconducting triangles @xcite we simulated a more realistic model for such system in order to understand and corroborated the physics behind the observed ratchet effects , with special emphasis in the finite temperature effects not taking into account in previous and simpler models .    in a pionner analytical work @xcite different asymmetric type - ii superconducting structures ( rings and strips )",
    "were already proposed and analyzed under current and magnetic field applied .",
    "they show how magnetic flux penetration depending on the geometric parameters is fieldlike or currentlike .",
    "later on , measurements were realized in asymmetric sc rings @xcite . in addition",
    "similar rectification effects were reported in a singly connected structured if the current injection is off - center @xcite . from mentioned works it is widely accepted that the effects observed are due to the asymmetry causing a difference in critical current for a positive or negative applied external current which is compensated or reinforced by the field induced persistent current .",
    "further an important parameter , temperature , should be taking into account to model in detail the phenomena observed .",
    "first because all results reported in single triangle samples are done close to @xmath0 @xcite , it means where thermal fluctuations are important and far away from @xmath1 where previous theoretical analysis was done @xcite .",
    "in addition it is well known that geometry in microsized or in nanosized samples could play essential roles in fluctuations phenomena and even more , very recently it was shown that the superconducting order parameter present larger thermal fluctuations in the corners of sharp shaped samples @xcite . at present , when smaller dimensions are manipulated it is motivating to study effects of thermal fluctuations even at temperature much lower than @xmath0 where dimensionality start to compete and the limits between thermal fluctuations and quantum fluctuations are not clear . in short , to understand how thermal fluctuations influence the rectification phenomena at all finite temperature is important .    in this paper we model voltage rectification effects observed in thin mesoscopic superconducting triangles @xcite using two kind of small josephson junction rings : a resistive one , using the rsj ( resistively shunted junction ) model and a capacitive model , using the rcsj ( resistevely and capacitive shunted junction ) model .",
    "we introduce finite temperature effects adding white noise to the resulting dynamics equations within the rsj model .",
    "we find good qualitative agreement with experiments .",
    "we study at finite temperature the dynamics of small josephson junction rings ( closed loops ) with a finite number of identical josephson junctions ( jj ) : three jj @xmath2 , four jj @xmath3 or five jj , @xmath4 as sketched in fig.[fig : jjr ] for different positions of the current injection .",
    "an external sinusoidal ac current is applied in different loop points as shown in fig.[fig : jjr ] in order to mimics the different contact configurations , samples a , b and c used in experiments @xcite .",
    "jj , @xmath4 jj or @xmath3 jj ( upper panels ) , according to the experimental samples a , b or c with different contact positions ( lower panels ) .",
    "note the different asymmetric current injection for @xmath2 , a , below the geometrical center and @xmath4 , b , above the geometrical center in opposite to the symmetric current injection for @xmath3 , c. lower panels ( generosity of nele schildermans and a.v .",

    "it is well known that nucleation in mesoscopic samples is dominated by the surface superconductivity and its shape and boundaries , _",
    "i.e _ by its geometry .",
    "in fact , it was clearly shown that surface nucleation is enhanced in wedge shaped superconductors @xcite , then the idea to model the triangle as a loop of strong superconducting electrodes ( sc islands ) at the triangle corners connected by weak links is reasonable .",
    "those weak links , could be an insulator as josephson proposed originally ( sis jj ) or a normal metal ( sns jj ) , or simpler a short narrow constriction of the same superconductor ( scs jj ) @xcite .",
    "our main assumption for the calculations is that the superconducting order parameter @xmath5 is such that @xmath6 with @xmath7 the same constant on all sc islands and @xmath8 is spatially constant in each island .",
    "then our variables will be the superconducting phases in each sc island .",
    "nucleation of the superconducting condensate starts from the sharp sample corners .",
    "the order parameter @xmath9 is maximum at the triangle vertices and minimum at the middle of the sides , then a ring of weak links ( jj ) is used to model this system.,width=453 ]    we started solving the simpler case , the ring of weak links of sns junctions , using the resistively shunted junction ( rsj ) model plus thermal fluctuations and solving numerically the superconducting phase dynamics using langevin dynamics technique @xcite .",
    "we considere a total magnetic field @xmath10 applied perpendicular to the ring , spatially and temporally constant .",
    "the hamiltonian of a closed loop of @xmath11 sns - junctions is the following : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the josephson energy , @xmath14 is the superconducting phase difference at the junction @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the phase of the superconducting island centered at @xmath17 being @xmath18 the ring radius .",
    "note here that our loops imitating the triangle samples , are ideal junction circles where the needed triangle asymmetry can be introduce controlling the number of junctions and the points where external currents are injected and extracted ( see fig .",

    "the total magnetic field is @xmath19 .",

    "we inject a current @xmath30 between junctions @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and extract it @xmath33 junctions away , between junctions @xmath34 and @xmath33 .",
    "the resulting set of dimensionless equations for the currents flowing in the ring is the following :    @xmath35    @xmath36    @xmath37    which are @xmath11 first order differential equations for the time evolution of the @xmath11 phase variables @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 is the current flowing in the upper branch of the ring , up with respect to the injection and extraction current points , and @xmath40 .",
    "let us note that each junction interacts with all the others through @xmath41 , the total current in the upper branch of the circuit , which represents a kind of mean - field interaction plus a drive .",
    "in addition finite temperature effects are taking into account through an added langevin noise term @xmath42 , introduced as current fluctuations , which models the contact with a thermal bath at temperature @xmath43 and satisfies the condition for non - correlated white noise :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the normal state resistance .",
    "in short the model control parameters are the external current @xmath30 , magnetic field applied or magnetic flux @xmath46 and temperature t. in addition one can play with the source - drain distance @xmath33 and the number of junctions n.    langevin dynamical equations eq .  [",

    "we can also conclude that the maximum of @xmath82 is almost the same in both cases when the temperature is closer to zero , but when temperature is increased these maximum decrease , as it is expected when thermal fluctuations are present , but the rates are different depending on the sample type , the maximum rectified voltage @xmath83 decreases quicker in the larger loop , @xmath4 . at @xmath84",

    "three characteristics of the oscillations dependency on magnetic field are found to be independent of temperature : ( a ) the rectification effects disappear if @xmath98 , being @xmath21 an integer , ( b ) the maximum absolute value of the rectified voltage appears always the condition @xmath99 is fulfilled and ( c ) @xmath100 if @xmath101",
    ". the observed dependences of rectified voltage on magnetic field are in accordance with expected little - parks oscillations , which occur every time the vorticity of the system increase due to the entrance of a new vortex : @xmath102 @xcite . in addition",
    "a noticeable feature appears , the sign of the rectified voltage changes , from negative if @xmath103 to positive if @xmath104 ( being @xmath21 an integer ) for @xmath2 and signs are inverted for @xmath4 .",
    "this opposite behavior between both devices is related with its asymmetry and it is the best evidence that indeed the observed rectification effects are due to the superposition of the external applied sinusoidal current ( bias current ) with the field induced persistent current circulating around the jjrs .",
    "the external current injection is well below the geometrical center for @xmath2 device on the contrary to @xmath4 device , then an opposite current compensation behavior was obtained .",
    "it is worth to mention that all simulations were performed as well for the symmetric current injection case , sample c , and no voltage response was observed , corroborating the essential need of an off - center current injection ( system asymmetry induced externally for the contacts configuration ) .",
    "note that @xmath82 decreases to zero while temperature is increased , in both cases . in order to analyze this last feature in detail comparing both contact configurations , the rectified dc voltage as a function of temperature",
    "is shown in fig .",

    "the absolute value of the rectified voltage decrease smoothly to zero with similar temperature functionality while temperature is incremented slowly in several orders of magnitude .",
    "it is worth to mention that it remains finite for a wide range of temperature .",
    "analyzing the three curves presented for @xmath2 , a rectified voltage tendency to zero as the magnetic flux approach to @xmath107 is observed as well , in coincidence with previous fig .",

    "for all examples @xmath80 . ]    in short we found that simple loop of weak links modeled with a resistive shunted model ( @xmath112 ) plus thermal fluctuations is in good agreement with experimental results .",
    "the following question naturally arises : is a ring of capacitive josephson junctions , _",
    "i.e. _ a capacitive and resistive shunted model ( @xmath113 ) a suitable model to explain the observed phenomena ? .",
    "in order to get an insight into this point we include the capacitive effects in our simulations . as an illustration in fig.[vbeta ] a comparison of the mean dc voltage response @xmath97 vs @xmath74 among the three type of contact configurations ( @xmath114 ) is shown .",

    "in summary , _ at finite temperature _ we predicted within a model system that the amplitude of the rectified signal depends strongly on the current contacts configuration in the jjr , in good agreement with recent diode effects measured in al mesoscopic triangles @xcite and in coincidence as well with a more sophisticated model including capacitive effects .",
    "our results corroborate that the clue behind the observed rectification effects in triangle shaped sc is indeed the superposition of the field induced persistent current with the bias current , being these phenomena robust and strong enough in front of thermal fluctuations and for more complicated modeling of the weak links . the key ingredients to observe the dc voltage rectification described here under thermal fluctuations",
    "are indeed field induced persistent currents and asymmetry induced by an off - center injection of external currents .",
    "this recipe suggests that similar rectification effects , strongly robust under finite temperature , should be also present in every system with a persistent current and an asymmetric current path , being useful to design and control newer and smaller diode devices .",
