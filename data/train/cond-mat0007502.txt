    "the possibility of controlling ferromagnetic interactions between the localized spins by the carriers,@xcite as well as the demonstration of efficient spin injection into a normal semiconductor,@xcite have recently renewed the interest in diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms).@xcite if made functional at reasonably high temperature , ferromagnetic semiconductors would allow one to incorporate spin electronics into usual electronics , and even path the way to integrated quantum computers.@xcite up to now , the carrier - induced ferromagnetism has been observed in lead - salt materials , pb@xmath2sn@xmath3mn@xmath1te,@xciteand in mbe - grown semiconductors with the zinc - blende structure : in@xmath0mn@xmath1as@xcite and ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as,@xcite as well as in p - doped cd@xmath0mn@xmath1te quantum wells@xcite and zn@xmath0mn@xmath1te epilayers,@xcite in which the observation of the onsets of magnetic ordering in the temperature range between 1 and 3  k corroborated theoretical predictions.@xcite thus , while promisingly high curie temperatures , @xmath4 up to 110  k,@xcite are observed in the gaas - based compounds , they are dramatically lower in the ii - vi dms structures studied so far . however , the ii - vi compounds appear as model materials , in which localized spins and the holes can be introduced and controlled independently , and modulation - doped heterostructures are feasible , so that dimensionality effects can be examined .    in this paper , we present the phase diagram of nitrogen - doped p - zn@xmath0mn@xmath1te , _",

    "our findings emphasize the importance of taking carefully into account the competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions as well as the complex structure of the valence band in the calculation of @xmath11.@xcite finally , we discuss the case of lower doping , for which the onset of hole localization is clearly observed . we show that localization does not perturb significantly the magnitude of curie - weiss temperature but reduces the saturation value of magnetization and gives raise to slow spin dynamics .",
    "the heavily doped dms studied here lie in - between the case of diluted magnetic metals,@xcite where the standard rkky theory is applicable , and lightly doped dms,@xcite for which carriers thermally excited to the band@xcite and interactions between bound magnetic polarons@xcite have been suggested as agents mediating the ferromagnetic coupling .",
    "our results make it possible to identify differences and similarities between ferromagnetic iii - v and ii - vi material systems .",

    "thus , this sample has to be considered as metallic , also in the absence of the magnetic field , as its conductivity remains an order of magnitude greater than @xmath44 , even at 100  mk .",
    "in contrast , the conductivity of samples with slightly smaller hole concentrations decreases rather dramatically when lowering the temperature indicating that the holes become localized at low temperatures in the absence of the field . such localization induced by magnetic disorder",
    "was also detected in bridgman - grown zn@xmath0mn@xmath1te : p with @xmath45  @xmath25.@xcite we have checked that no reentrant metallic behavior occurs in such samples down to 100  mk .",

    "the latter is enhanced by the increase of the carrier kinetic energy , which results from their redistribution between the spin subbands , an effect particularly important in p - type dms.@xcite    in conclusion , the studies of conductance as a function of temperature and magnetic field reveal qualitatively similar properties of n - type and p - type ii - vi dms in the vicinity of the mit .",
    "in particular , the temperature dependent localization and negative magnetoresistance indicate that the efficiency of spin disorder scattering increases at low temperature .",
    "this means that ferromagnetic correlation grows when the temperature decreases . however , the correlation length of some ferromagnetic puddles has to remain small , of the order of the de broglie wavelength of the itinerant holes , to result in efficient scattering of the hole spins .",
    "figure 2 shows the hall resistivity @xmath46 measured at various temperatures for the highly doped zn@xmath22mn@xmath23te sample .",
    "the quoted hole concentration is deduced from the slope of the room temperature hall resistance .",
    "we found that @xmath46 is linear in the magnetic field and temperature independent down to 150  k. in the case of the znte sample , this normal hall effect @xmath46 linear in the field @xmath47 and temperature independent , is observed down to 1.6  k ( not shown ) . by contrast , in the case of zn@xmath0mn@xmath1te , when decreasing the temperature below 100  k , one observes first an increase of the slope of the hall resistance , and then a strong non - linearity .",

    "it is clearly observed in iii - v dms,@xcite but not in n - doped ii - vi dms.@xcite its large magnitude stems from the importance of the spin - orbit coupling in the valence band and from the large polarization of the hole liquid .",
    "the latter results from the giant zeeman splitting of the four hole subbands , which is proportional to the magnetization of the mn spins . at low temperature and high field",
    ", the mn or the hole spin polarization saturates , and then the hall resistivity exhibits again a linear dependence on the applied field , with the same slope as at room temperature .",
    "thus , while the spin - dependent component is too large to allow us to determine the hole density at low temperatures and in small fields , its magnitude becomes negligibly small at room temperature , or at low - temperature in high fields .",
    "for these two cases , the slope of the hall resistance was found to be identical , giving unambiguously the value of the hole density .",

    "i.e. _ , ( i ) the normal hall effect dominates at temperatures above 150  k ; ( ii ) the hall resistivity varies linearly with the magnetic field at low temperature in sufficiently large magnetic fields , and ( iii ) a strong spin - dependent component appears at weak magnetic fields and at low temperature , though its accurate determination in this region is hampered by the large value of the resistance and a strong magnetoresistance .",
    "as mentioned above , the hall resistance provides direct information on the degree of spin polarization @xmath49 of the carrier liquid .",

    "another , more intuitive , description is obtained by noting that applying the molecular field @xmath151 along the @xmath103 direction splits the fermi surface into two ( up and down ) surfaces , with the zeeman splitting of the heavy holes proportional to @xmath152,@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "the spin polarization is obtained by integrating @xmath138 over the states between the two fermi surfaces , both @xmath138 and the population depending on @xmath142 .",
    "this means , in particular , that the spin polarization of the holes , _",
    "i.e. _ , the spin component of their magnetization , is not simply proportional to the difference in the up and down populations , as it would be the case for the electrons in the conduction band . by integrating the sum of the square of the relevant matrix elements over the solid angle",
    "we obtain the reduction factor @xmath153 .",
    "hence , this reduction factor expresses the fact that the heavy - hole spin is quantized along the direction of @xmath129 , so that exchange splitting vanishes for @xmath154 .",

    "we identify two experimentally important situations , for which the zener model , as introduced above , ceases to be valid .",
    "the first one corresponds to the case when an average time of carrier tunneling between mn pairs @xmath160 becomes significantly longer than the inverse exchange energy @xmath161 . here",
    "@xmath162 is the width of the carrier band , and its magnitude , not the fermi energy as sometimes suggested , constitutes the relevant energy scale . for long tunneling times ,",

    "important changes in the carrier response function occur at the length scale of a mean distance between the localized spins .",
    "accordingly , the description of spin magnetization by the continuous - medium approximation , which constitutes the basis of the zener model , ceases to be valid .",
    "in contrast , the rkky model is a good starting point in this regime , as it provides the dependence of the interaction energy of particular spin pairs as a function of their distance .",
    "this makes it possible to evaluate the system energy for a given distribution of the localized spins .",
    "we note in passing that in the limit when the continuous - medium approximation is valid , @xmath165 , the mean - field value of the ordering temperature @xmath166 deduced from the zener and rkky model are identical , independently of microscopic spin arrangement .",
    "in particular , in both models , the curie temperature is determined entirely by matrix elements that are diagonal in @xmath129 , as non - diagonal terms vanish when the continuous - medium approximation is valid . if this is not the case , the two models are equivalent only if the spins are randomly distributed over a continuum.@xcite    since the rkky model appears as more general , it is tempting to adopt it for the description of experimental findings .",
    "unfortunately , however , in the presence of spin - orbit interaction , the spin - spin hamiltonian contains non - scalar pseudo - dipole and moriya - dzialoshinskii terms , whose dependence of the pair distance seems to be described by non - elementary functions .",
    "briefly , the rkky model is technically much more cumbersome than the zener model for the holes in the @xmath167 band . on the other hand , in the case of the sample with the highest doping level ,",
    "the hole concentration @xmath33  @xmath25 becomes comparable with @xmath168  @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , we note that the blocking of n .- n . mn pairs in the zero - spin state by antiferromagnetic superexchange not only reduces the effective spin concentration but also makes the spin distribution to be highly non - random  no n .- n .",
    "mn pairs are involved in the ferromagnetic interactions .    in order to evaluate the resulting effect on the curie - weiss temperature we start from the expression for the energy of the rkky exchange interaction between two mn spins at relative position",

    "in contrast , the localization length @xmath194 diverges at the mit and , according to the scaling picture , decreases gradually towards the bohr radius @xmath195 deeply in the insulator phase .",
    "then , the ferromagnetic exchange is mediated by carriers thermally excited to the band@xcite or by spin - dependent coupling between bmp.@xcite however , over a wide range of dopant concentrations , the average value of @xmath194 is significantly larger than both @xmath195 and @xmath188 .",
    "we expect that such weakly localized carriers carry efficiently the spin - spin coupling .",
    "since distances smaller than @xmath188 are important for ferromagnetism , carrier localization will have a minor influence on the value of @xmath176 for such an exchange mechanism .    at the same time , however , large mesoscopic fluctuations in the local values of @xmath191 and @xmath194 , are expected in the vicinity of the mit .",
    "this will introduce additional randomness in the system , the corresponding correlation length being of the order of either spin coherence , thermal or localization length , each presumably much longer than that characterizing magnetic disorder . in a simplistic two - fluid picture,@xcite",
    "we envisage that mosaics of ferromagnetic and paramagnetic regions appear at the curie temperature .",
    "the latter corresponds to regions not visited by the carriers .",

    "the value @xmath196 was calculated by a local spin - density approach for a 3d carrier liquid of similar density.@xcite we adopt this value here , as its enhancement by disorder is probably unimportant due to efficient spin - flip scattering in our system .",

    "<S> we present a systematic study of the ferromagnetic transition induced by the holes in nitrogen doped zn@xmath0mn@xmath1te epitaxial layers , with particular emphasis on the values of the curie - weiss temperature as a function of the carrier and spin concentrations . </S>",
    "<S> the data are obtained from thorough analyses of the results of magnetization , magnetoresistance and spin - dependent hall effect measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental findings compare favorably , without adjustable parameters , with the prediction of the rudermann - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) model or its continuous - medium limit , that is , the zener model , provided that the presence of the competing antiferromagnetic spin - spin superexchange interaction is taken into account , and the complex structure of the valence band is properly incorporated into the calculation of the spin susceptibility of the hole liquid . in general terms , the findings demonstrate how the interplay between the ferromagnetic rkky interaction , carrier localization , and intrinsic antiferromagnetic superexchange affects the ordering temperature and the saturation value of magnetization in magnetically and electrostatically disordered systems . </S>"
