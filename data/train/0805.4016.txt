    "this paper , the consequence of these properties is two  fold : in environments with high enough density of dm particles , self  annihilation of neutralinos could constitute a source of energy , emitted in the form of radiation , which can potentially overcome the cooling of the gas , inhibiting or slowing down the formation of a proto  star . when ( and if ) something resembling a celestial object is formed , such weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) can scatter off the baryonic material and lose energy , thus being gravitationally captured ; they accumulate and annihilate inside the object , thus providing it with an ( additional ) energy source .    at present , the typical dm densities are too low to provide any dramatic , widespread effect on stellar evolution : recent calculations show that dm densities necessary to induce strong effects are achievable only within the central two parsecs of our galaxy , with similar restrictions applying to all galaxies in the local universe ( fairbairn , scott & edsjo , 2008 ) . the first star  forming mini - haloes",
    ", however , are smaller and denser : this provides favorable conditions for dm annihilation effects to play a role .",
    "as noticed by spolyar , freese & gondolo ( 2008 ) , wimp annihilation in young haloes during the formation of the first stars could provide an amount of energy equal to the one dissipated by chemical cooling of the gas .",
    "also , as noticed by iocco ( 2008 ) and freese , spolyar & aguirre ( 2008 ) , the energy produced by dm annihilation captured inside early stars could even exceed the one produced by their nuclear burning .",
    "additional effects of dm decays and annihilations have also been considered in the literature , with particular attention to their contribution on the reionization and thermal histories of the intergalactic medium ( mapelli & ferrara 2005 ; ripamonti , mapelli & ferrara 2007a ; valds et al . 2007 ) as well as on the conditions for star formation in the first mini  haloes ( ripamonti , mapelli & ferrara 2007b ) .    in this paper , we aim at studying the effects of neutralino dm annihilation on stellar evolution in the early universe .",
    "we will treat separately the effects arising from dm contraction during stellar collapse and from dm captured by scattering with the baryons : although these are clearly part of the same picture , the physical mechanisms are different and observational and experimental constraints on the parameters involved have different nature and reliability .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "in particular , the latter analysis focused on low  mass stars ( @xmath184 ) and found they eventually reach the hayashi line for different dm density values at different masses ( @xmath185gev/@xmath77 for 1 @xmath88 ) , using the same current upper limit on @xmath11 we adopt , and a different value for @xmath9 , of the order of the relative velocity between wimps and sun , @xmath186(10@xmath90km / s ) .",

    "the details of this depend on environmental conditions of dm , elastic scattering cross section between wimps and baryons , and mass of the star .    for our fiducial set of parameters ( @xmath9=10 km / s , @xmath10=10@xmath190gev/@xmath77 , @xmath11=10@xmath140@xmath17 )",
    ", we find that :    * small and intermediate mass stars ( @xmath18 ) are most affected by sc luminosity and their evolution is halted on the hr diagram before reaching the zams . *",
    "_ dark _ stars can be supported by sc luminosity as long as the environmental conditions remain unaltered .",
    "this is because , unlike the ac mechanism , sc luminosity depends on the flux of dm particles streaming through the star from outside , thus drawing from a virtually unexhaustable reservoir : _ dark _ stars remain `` frozen '' on the hr diagram . * stars with masses @xmath191 manage to ignite nuclear reactions , and go through the main sequence supported by an additional energy source : dark matter `` burning '' prolonges their lifetimes from a factor 2 for a @xmath20 to a factor 5 for a @xmath21 star .",
    "these conclusions depend on the assumed dark matter parameters and on the specific environment where the first stars are expected to form . however , they do not strongly depend on the assumed primordial chemical composition of the stars .",
    "thus , they can be applied to more evolved stellar populations as long as the characteristics of the environment where these stars form are similar to the ones we have considered .",
    "the existence of _ dark _ stars can have many interesting consequences for a number of issues .",
    "in fact , once they are frozen on the hr diagram , they have effective temperatures in the range @xmath192 k and provide a continuous source of uv photons .",
    "this could have interesting consequences for the radiative feedback on the parent and neighbouring haloes as well as on the reionization history .",
    "the duration of this _ dark _ stellar phase is difficult to estimate , as it depends on the persistence of high dark matter densities around the stars .",
    "therefore , their fate is strictly related to the evolution of their parent dark matter haloes and their merger histories .",
    "of course , the present analysis represents only a first step of more refined future studies ; however , it opens a relatively novel window on high redshift star formation . progresses on the issues discussed here",
    "might lead to considerable understanding of the signatures that the yet mysterious dark matter particles have unmistakably left on the stars that formed in the baby universe .",

    "when l@xmath207/l@xmath208=10% , the adiabatic contraction phase is essentially over .",
    "the stage l@xmath209/l@xmath208= 95% indicate the point where the nuclear energy source provides 95% of the stellar luminosity . in absence of dm scattering",
    "/ capture this point indicates the beginning of the major hydrogen nuclear burning phase . on the contrary when dm scattering / capture becomes efficient , this point may be reached at an advanced stage of nuclear burning , or even not reached at all , for stars that suffer sc stalling .",
    "the contribution of the sc energy source makes the nuclear burning to occur at a slower rate , thus prolonging the lifetime of the star by a significant amount . in some circumstances",
    "the star is practically totally sustained by the sc luminosity with a negligible nuclear burning .",
    "in all these cases we provide the central hydrogen fraction and the fractional nuclear luminosity .",
    "these quantities may help the reader to evaluate the importance of the effect and , for the stalled stars , to roughly estimate the duration of the phase .",
    "finally , the last stage in the tables corresponds either to central hydrogen exhaustion , or to the stalled model at an age of 5 myr .",
    "we remark that , in the latter case , the stellar tracks have been evolved for a much longer time ( larger than the standard hydrogen burning lifetime ) to properly check the stalling condition . in tables",
    "a3 and a4 we do not report the first stages because they are identical to those in table a2 .",
    "the ac term is important in the early contraction pre - main sequence phase . by comparing ac and standard models",
    "we notice that , while the absolute duration of this phase increases as the mass decreases , the relative effect ( i.e. the ratio between lifetimes at the hayashi minimum for a given mass ) increases strongly with the stellar mass . in any case",
    "the ac phase does not particularly affect the total nuclear burning lifetime .",
    "actually some standard models show slightly longer hydrogen burning lifetimes compared to the corresponding ac cases .",
    "this reflects the fact that the beginning of the main sequence is reached with small structural differences ( e.g. location of convective boundaries ) , that propagates during the subsequent evolution .",
    "the sc term is never important in the pre - main sequence contraction phase since the large stellar radii strongly limit the sc luminosity ( directly via eq .",
