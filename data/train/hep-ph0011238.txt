    "the rare decays of b mesons are getting more and more interesting , since they are useful for search of cp violation and sensitive to new physics .",
    "the recent measurement of @xmath11 and @xmath12 decays by cleo collaboration @xcite arouse more discussions on these decays @xcite .",
    "the @xmath13 , @xmath14 decays which are helpful to the determination of cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) unitarity triangle @xmath10 have been studied in the factorization approach in detail @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we would like to study the @xmath13 and @xmath12 decays in the perturbative qcd approach ( pqcd ) , where we can calculate the non - factorizable contributions as corrections to the usual factorization approach .    in the @xmath13",
    ", @xmath12 decays , the @xmath15 meson is heavy , sitting at rest .",
    "it decays into two light mesons with large momenta .",
    "therefore the light mesons are moving very fast in the rest frame of @xmath15 meson . in this case",
    ", the short distance hard process dominates the decay amplitude .",
    "the reasons can be ordered as : first , because there are not many resonances near the energy region of @xmath15 mass , so it is reasonable to assume that final state interaction is not important in two - body @xmath15 decays .",
    "second , with the final light mesons moving very fast , there must be a hard gluon to kick the light spectator quark ( almost at rest ) in the b meson to form a fast moving pion or light vector meson .",
    "so the dominant diagram in this theoretical picture is that one hard gluon from the spectator quark connecting with the other quarks in the four quark operator of the weak interaction .",
    "there are also soft ( soft and collinear ) gluon exchanges between quarks .",
    "summing over those leading soft contributions gives a sudakov form factor , which suppresses the soft contribution to be dominant .",
    "therefore , it makes the pqcd reliable in calculating the non - leptonic decays . with the sudakov resummation",
    ", we can include the leading double logarithms for all loop diagrams , in association with the soft contribution .",
    "unlike the usual factorization approach , the hard part of the pqcd approach consists of six quarks rather than four .",
    "we thus call it six - quark operators or six - quark effective theory . applying the six - quark effective theory to b",
    "meson decays , we need meson wave functions for the hadronization of quarks into mesons . all the collinear dynamics are included in the meson wave functions .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the @xmath16 and @xmath17 form factors , which are input parameters used in factorization approach .",
    "the form factor calculations can give severe restrictions to the input meson wave functions .",
    "we also calculate the non - factorizable contributions and the annihilation type diagrams , which are difficult to calculate in the factorization approach .",
    "we found that this type of diagrams give dominant contributions to strong phases .",
    "the strong phase in this approach can also be calculated directly , without ambiguity . in the next section",
    ", we will briefly introduce our method of pqcd . in section 3 ,",
    "we perform the perturbative calculations for all the channels . and we give the numerical results and discussions in section 4 . finally section 5 is a short summary .",
    "the three scale pqcd factorization theorem has been developed for non - leptonic heavy meson decays @xcite .",
    "the factorization formula is given by the typical expression , @xmath18,\\label{factf}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 are the corresponding wilson coefficients , @xmath20 are the meson wave functions . and the quark anomalous dimension @xmath21 describes the evolution from scale @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "non - leptonic heavy meson decays involve three scales : the w boson mass @xmath24 , at which the matching condition of the effective hamiltonian are defined , the typical scale @xmath22 of a hard subamplitude , which reflects the dynamics of heavy quark decays , and the factorization scale @xmath23 , with b the conjugate variable of parton transverse momenta .",
    "the dynamics below @xmath23 scale is regarded as being completely non - perturbative , and can be parameterized into meson wave functions . above the scale @xmath23 , pqcd is reliable and radiative corrections produce two types of large logarithms : @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the former are summed by renormalization group equations to give the leading logarithm evolution from @xmath24 to @xmath22 scale contained in the wilson coefficients @xmath19 . while the latter are summed to give the evolution from @xmath22 scale down to @xmath23 , shown as the last factor in eq.([factf ] ) .",
    "there exist also double logarithms @xmath27 from the overlap of collinear and soft divergence , @xmath28 being the dominant light - cone component of a meson momentum .",
    "the resummation of these double logarithms leads to a sudakov form factor @xmath29 $ ] , which suppresses the long distance contributions in the large @xmath30 region , and vanishes as @xmath31 .",
    "this factor improves the applicability of pqcd . for the detailed derivation of the sudakov form factors ,",
    "see ref.@xcite .",
    "since all logarithm corrections have been summed by renormalization group equations , the above factorization formula does not depend on the renormalization scale @xmath32 .",
    "with all the large logarithms resummed , the remaining finite contributions are absorbed into a hard sub - amplitude @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath33 are calculated perturbatively involving the four quark operators together with the spectator quark , connected by a hard gluon .",
    "when the end - point region ( @xmath34 ) of wave function is important for the hard amplitude , the corresponding large double logarithms @xmath35 shall appear in the hard amplitude @xmath33 , which should be resummed to give a jet function @xmath36 .",
    "this technique is the so - called threshold resummation @xcite .",
    "the threshold resummation form factor @xmath36 vanishes as @xmath34 , which effectively suppresses the end - point behavior of the hard amplitude .",
    "this suppression will become important when the meson wave function remains constant at the end - point region .",
    "for example , the twist-3 wave function @xmath37 and @xmath38 are such kinds of wave functions , which can be found in the numerical section of this paper .",
    "the typical scale @xmath22 in the hard sub - amplitude is around @xmath39 .",
    "it is chosen as the maximum value of those scales appeared in the six quark action .",
    "this is to diminish the @xmath40 corrections to the six quark amplitude .",
    "the expression of scale @xmath22 in different sub - amplitude will be derived in the next section and the formula is showed in the appendix .",
    "first we begin with the weak effective hamiltonian @xmath41 for the @xmath42 transitions as @xmath43 \\quad .\\ ] ] we specify below the operators in @xmath44 for @xmath45 : @xmath46 here @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the @xmath49 color indices ; @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the left- and right - handed projection operators with @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "the sum over @xmath54 runs over the quark fields that are active at the scale @xmath55 , i.e. , @xmath56 .",
    "the pqcd approach works well for the leading twist approximation and leading double logarithm summation . for the wilson coefficients , we will also use the leading logarithm summation for the qcd corrections , although the next - to - leading order calculations already exist in the literature @xcite .",
    "this is the consistent way to cancel the explicit @xmath32 dependence in the theoretical formulae .",
    "if the scale @xmath57 , then we evaluate the wilson coefficients at @xmath22 scale using leading logarithm running equations @xcite , in the appendix b of ref.@xcite . in numerical calculations ,",
    "we use @xmath58 $ ] which is the leading order expression with @xmath59mev , derived from @xmath60mev . here",

    "@xmath63 when scale @xmath22 is larger than @xmath64 .",

    "the @xmath15 meson is treated as a heavy - light system . in general",

    "they obey to the following normalization conditions @xmath70 in general , one should consider both these two lorentz structures in calculations of @xmath15 meson decays .",
    "however , it can be argued that the contribution of @xmath71 is numerically small @xcite , thus its contribution can be numerically neglected .",
    "therefore , we only consider the contribution of lorentz structure @xmath72 in our calculation . we keep the same input as other calculations in this direction @xcite and it is also easier for comparing with other approaches @xcite . through out this paper , we use the light - cone coordinates to write the four momentum as ( @xmath73 ) . in the next section",
    ", we will see that the hard part is always independent of one of the @xmath74 and/or @xmath75 , if we make some approximations .",
