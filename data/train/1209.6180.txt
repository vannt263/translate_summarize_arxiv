    "this section introduces the minkowski structure metrics @xmath6 that were already alluded to above .",
    "the minkowski structure metrics ( msm ) are obtained by an adaption of the conventional boo parameters .",
    "the msm differ from the conventional @xmath5 , eq .",
    ", by the fact that the contribution of each neighbor to the structure metric is weighted by an associated relative area factor @xmath89 . in this factor , @xmath90 is the surface area of the voronoi cell facet @xmath91 separating the two neighboring spheres that correspond to a given bond , and @xmath92 is the total surface area of the voronoi cell boundary @xmath93 of sphere @xmath11 . this simple change leads to robust , continuous and parameter - free structure metrics @xmath6 that avoid the shortcomings of the conventional @xmath5 discussed above .",
    "we define @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the spherical angles of the outer normal vector @xmath97 of facet @xmath91 .",
    "note that the direction of this vector coincides with the bond vector that is used in conventional bond orientation analysis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : neighbors ] ) . because of the weighting of each bond by its corresponding voronoi facet area @xmath89 , these newly constructed structure metrics @xmath6 are continuous functions of the spheres center point coordinates , and hence robust .",
    "furthermore , this geometrical neighborhood is symmetric and parameter - free . the definition of @xmath6 results naturally from a multipole expansion in spherical harmonics of the voronoi cell surface normal distribution function @xmath98 on the unit sphere : @xmath99 , where @xmath100 evaluates to @xmath101 ; the star denoting complex conjugation .",
    "by contrast , the @xmath22th - moment of the distribution @xmath102 in cartesian coordinates is @xmath103 where @xmath104 denotes the tensor product .",
    "the moment tensors @xmath105 are special types of minkowski tensors @xcite .",
    "these versatile shape metrics have been studied in the field of integral geometry @xcite and successfully applied to analyze structure in jammed bead packs @xcite , bi - phasic assemblies @xcite , foams @xcite and other cellular structures @xcite .",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between this class of minkowski tensors and the multipole expansion of the surface normal vector distribution @xmath102 of a convex voronoi polytope @xmath93 @xcite .    for ideal crystals where all voronoi facets have equal size ,",
    "the values of the boo @xmath5 and of the msm @xmath6 are the same ; these symmetries are fcc , hcp , the icosahedron and sc ( simple cubic ) . in the case of bcc ,",
    "where voronoi cells have in total 14 facets , of which 8 correspond to closest neighbors and 6 to neighbors in the second shell , @xmath5 differ from @xmath6 ( see also table  [ tab : ql ] ) .",
    "the construction of the weighted @xmath6 has no adjustable parameters .",
    "however , the choice of the voronoi diagram as the partition that defines local neighborhood and that is used for the definition of @xmath6 may be viewed as arbitrary .",
    "its use can be justified as follows : first , the use of any partition of space into cells associated with the beads for the neighborhood definition guarantees symmetric neighborhoods , @xmath106 .",
    "second , the use of the voronoi diagram ensures that the following minimal requirements are met : ( a ) convex cells , ( b ) invariance under exchange of spheres decorating the seed points and ( c ) the possibility to reconstruct the seed point coordinates uniquely from the facet information @xcite .",
    "the authors are unaware of an alternative to the voronoi diagram that fulfills these requirements .",
    "for the use of both boo parameters and msm , an important issue is the choice of the weights @xmath22 that are considered .",
    "many studies restrict themselves to only @xmath1 , possibly supplemented by @xmath0 and the associated higher - order invariants @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "this is likely to be motivated by @xmath1 being the apparent generalization of the two - dimensional hexatic order parameter @xmath8 .",
    "the relation between the @xmath110 structure metrics and ordering , however , is not as direct in 3d as it is in 2d : @xmath1 is maximized by icosahedral bond order , which is incompatible with translational order .",
    "the perception that large values of certain structure metrics , in particular @xmath1 , are intrinsically connected with crystallization is therefore deceiving , and it is useful to discuss the relevance of the individual weights to physical problems .    in all cases",
    ", @xmath111 is trivially @xmath112 while @xmath113 trivially vanishes , due to the so - called _ envelope theorems _ of mueller @xcite ( note , this does not apply to @xmath114 ) .",
    "thus , the first weight that captures pertinent information about a disordered system is @xmath115 ; for hcp and fcc crystals @xmath107 vanishes .",
    "the invariants @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( and odd weights in general ) vanish in configurations symmetric under inversion , but capture deviations from this symmetry ( see tab .  [",
    "tab : ql ] ) .",
    "hence they might be robust candidates for defect detection like centro - symmetry metrics @xcite or to separate hcp from fcc , since the hcp voronoi cell is not inversion symmetric ( see tab .  [ tab : ql ] ) , while fcc is inversion symmetric ( @xmath118 ) with respect to the sphere centers . including steinhardt _",
    "et al . _ s original paper @xcite we are not aware of any applications of odd weights @xmath22 . the lowest weight to discriminate a sphere from a cube is @xmath119 and thus plays an important role in ordered materials .",
    "the cubic - symmetry fcc , bcc , and simple cubic lattices all have non - vanishing @xmath120 values ( for the conventional boo parameters though , great care is needed for the bond definition , as different sets of nn for bcc reveals a dramatic change on conventional @xmath0 ) .",
    "@xmath1 is the first non - vanishing weight for icosahedral symmetry ( and maximum for the icosahedron ) .",
    "note that the @xmath1 values for fcc can be matched by deformed icosahedral bonds . while in ordered states , the @xmath5 are easily interpreted , in disordered states",

    "the thermodynamic phase transition from the fluid to the solid ( fcc ) phase at packing fractions around @xmath133 is clearly visible .",
    "furthermore , jammed sphere packs are well distinguished from the equilibrium configurations .",
    "starting from the equilibrium and avoiding crystallization , the non - equilibrium ma - md protocol continues the fluid branch into a super - cooled fluid regime .",
    "the uls protocol generates further non - equilibrium states with larger @xmath107 , up to jammed configurations . in both diagrams ( a ) and ( c )",
    ", the non - equilibrium fluid states are found above the linear extrapolation of the equilibrium fluid branch , while the ordered phase is below .",
    "the diagram ( b ) , showing @xmath74 , reproduces ( though `` upside down '' ) quite well the qualitative features obtained from @xmath121 or @xmath134 .",
    "the agreement of these two plots , however , is coincidental .",
    "while the separation of the fluid and solid branches in the @xmath107 diagram is due to the fact that only ordered clusters have vanishing @xmath107 , there is a large number of possible disordered clusters that have @xmath135 , in particular , perturbed icosahedral bond arrangements .",
    "these are , however , not present in the data in large numbers and thus can be neglected @xcite .",
    "if they occurred in significant abundance in the systems , an increase of @xmath74 would be the consequence .",
    "values of @xmath123 close to @xmath136 do , however , occur even in disordered systems @xcite .",
    "thus deviations from @xmath137 arguably are a better criterion for disorder than deviations from @xmath138 .",
    "since both fcc and hcp have @xmath137 , they can not be discerned using @xmath107 alone .",
    "the dense ( @xmath139 ) jls packings , for example , consist of a significant fraction of hcp and fcc clusters on a disordered background .",
    "increasing packing fraction reduces the amount of disordered configurations , and proportionally , their weight in the @xmath140 averages .",
    "consequently , the @xmath107 curves tend towards @xmath137 as the ordered clusters take over a larger amount of the system , while the terminus of the @xmath123 curves reflects an average of @xmath141 and @xmath142 , weighted with the relative fraction of fcc and hcp domains",
    ".    a separation of all the regimes can not be seen in the @xmath120 plot ( d ) , since @xmath120 takes for crystalline ( fcc and hcp ) phases fixed values which are lying on a strong random background from the disordered parts of the system .",
    "this article has clearly demonstrated that the conventional bond - orientational order parameters @xmath5 , defined via nearest neighbor bonds , eq .  , are very strongly affected by the choice of neighborhood definition ( cf .",
    "[ fig : zoomin_super - cooled_liquid - averages - q6 ] ) ; this sensitivity is observed both in the qualitative trend and in absolute values .",
    "it was shown that for disordered systems without crystallization , @xmath1 strongly correlates to the average number of nearest neighbors .",
    "this effect overshadows the actual structural changes induced by the physics of the system ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig : correlation - q6-volume ] ) .",
    "this dependence is a major drawback that needs to be taken into account when using @xmath5 for the analysis of particulate matter , especially when comparing @xmath5 values across different studies .",
    "we have proposed a unique , well - defined and robust structure metric @xmath6 , eq .",
    ", that avoids the ambiguities that come with bond network neighborhoods .",
    "robustness of the structure metric is achieved by quantifying the geometry of the voronoi tessellation .",
    "the msm share the same mathematical form with the conventional bond - orientational order parameters , but the `` bonds '' are weighted with the associated voronoi facet area .",
    "this guarantees , in particular , that the new minkowski structure metrics are continuous as a function of the sphere coordinates . for hcp , fcc and simple cubic lattices",
    ", this definition reproduces the values of the conventional @xmath5 ( cf .  tab .",
    "[ tab : ql ] ) . for super - cooled hard - sphere fluids ,",
    "the msm @xmath123 is very similar to the conventional @xmath1 with the ( rarely used ) @xmath48 neighborhood definition , see fig .",
    "[ fig : zoomin_super - cooled_liquid - averages - q6 ] .",
    "the morphometric neighborhood has previously been characterized using minkowski tensors @xcite , which measure the distribution of normal vectors of the voronoi cells .",
    "the minkowski structure metrics presented here can be interpreted as the rotational invariants of a multipole expansion of the same distribution of normal vectors ; indeed , the approaches of higher - rank minkowski tensors and minkowski structure metrics turn out to be mathematically equivalent ways to cure the shortcomings of bond - orientational order parameters .",
    "there are further possibilities to address this problem by introducing weighting factors , see for example ref .",
    "note however that these approaches need adjustable parameters . the caution for the use of @xmath1 as a sole determinant of local crystallinity expressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , is independent of the issues addressed by this paper , and remains valid also for the minkowski structure metric @xmath123 .",
    "thus , minkowski tensors and structure metrics both provide a `` geometrization '' of the bond - orientational order for spherical particles .",
    "this suggests a strategy to generalize bond - orientational order parameters towards aspherical particles , such as ellipsoids , using generalized voronoi tessellations and the @xmath6 .",
    "even applications to non - cellular shapes with arbitrary topology are possible , albeit with altered interpretation @xcite .    finally , our analysis supports the more frequent use of the low - weight @xmath5 , in particular @xmath107 , that have been largely overlooked in the literature .",
    "@xmath107 carries the same information as the anisotropy index @xmath124 of refs .",
    "@xcite ( cf .",
    "[ fig : structurediagram ] ) . both @xmath107 and @xmath124 can be used to robustly classify collective states in particulate matter according to their structural features .",
    "furthermore , @xmath107 is very strongly discerns between disordered configurations and such of high symmetry , such as hcp , fcc , bcc , simple cubic , and icosahedral order .",
    "clearly , 30 years after the seminal publication by steinhardt _",
    "_ , the need for quantitative local structure analysis is more evident than ever .",
    "the present paper reaffirms the validity and usefulness of the multipole expansion method .",
    "we have , however , described an amended version of the bond - orientational order parameters that not only renders this method robust and uniquely defined , but also gives a firmer interpretation of their geometric meaning",
