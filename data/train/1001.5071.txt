    "much experimental progress has recently been achieved in the area of ultra - cold atoms .",
    "it is now possible @xcite to make systems of atoms confined in optical lattices formed by laser beams and at the same time control the strength of the two - body interaction with magnetic fields .",
    "the atoms are cooled down to extremely low temperatures and , in the limit of low tunneling , each lattice site may be regarded as a harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) well , which is independent from the others and contains only a few atoms . using a feshbach resonance ,",
    "the two - body interaction can be fine - tuned so that the @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath1 is made much larger than the range @xmath2 of the interaction . by doing so , the theoretical problem of a system of trapped particles interacting via short - range forces can be realized experimentally .    such atomic systems present remarkable similarities to some nuclear physics systems .",
    "indeed , the two - nucleon scattering length is much larger than the range of the nuclear force , set by the pion mass .",
    "in such a situation , the physical properties of few - body systems are universal , that is , they depend mainly on @xmath1 , not on the details of the two - body interaction . at sufficiently low energies ,",
    "an effective field theory ( eft ) has been formulated which turns this separation of scales into an expansion in powers of @xmath3 @xcite . except for isospin , which does play a role in the relative relevance of few - body forces , the version of this eft used in nuclear physics @xcite is formally indistinguishable from the theory describing atomic systems @xcite .",
    "( nevertheless , the underlying theories for the two cases are very different . ) as a consequence , atomic systems characterized by large scattering lengths can be studied with techniques developed in nuclear physics and , conversely , provide an excellent testing ground for few- and many - body methods that can be further applied , with little or no change , to the description of nuclear systems at low energies .",
    "the no - core shell model ( ncsm ) is one of the most flexible _ ab initio _",
    "methods used to obtain the solution to the non - relativistic schrdinger equation for many - nucleon systems @xcite . currently , it is the only such method able to reach medium - mass nuclei with no restrictions to closed or nearly - closed shells and at the same time to handle local and non - local interactions on the same footing .",
    "it uses a discrete single - particle basis typically a ho basis and , being a numerical method , relies on a suitable truncation of the model space accessible to nucleons in the form of a maximum number @xmath4 of accessible shells above the minimum configuration .",
    "this requires the use of effective interactions ( not only among nucleons but also among nucleons and external probes such as photons , when they are present ) to account for effects left out by the truncation to a finite model space .",
    "the method of choice has been the construction of effective operators via unitary transformations .",
    "this involves the use of an approximation , the so - called  cluster approximation \" , which is not _ a priori _ controlled , and which poses challenges for the description of low - momentum observables @xcite .",
    "an alternative is to use eft to construct effective interactions that are consistent with the underlying theory of qcd directly in the model spaces where many - nucleon calculations are carried out @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the problem of two trapped atoms with large scattering length , @xmath5 , from the perspective of eft interactions solved with the ncsm .",
    "the main simplification with respect to the nuclear case is that the trapping potential provides a natural single - particle basis ; its ho length @xmath6 does not need to be removed at the end of the calculation because it represents the long - distance physics of the trap . as long as @xmath7",
    ", the trapped system should still exhibit universal behavior , although for @xmath8 it is significantly different from that of the untrapped system .",
    "we use eft techniques to expand the interaction between particles as a series of contact interactions with an increasing number of derivatives , and calculate energy levels inside the trap by explicitly solving the schrdinger equation .",
    "we extend here the work initiated in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which only the leading - order ( lo ) interaction was investigated .",
    "we include explicitly corrections up to the next - to - next - to - leading - order ( n@xmath9lo ) , and show how they provide improved convergence as @xmath4 increases , at least as long as they are treated in perturbation theory .",
    "finite and infinite values of the scattering length @xmath1 are considered , and we show that in the @xmath10 limit our lo results converge to the levels of a pseudopotential @xcite with the same scattering length , obtained by busch _",
    "starting at nlo a finite value of the effective range @xmath11 is allowed as well , and at higher orders other effective - range expansion parameters could be included similarly .",
    "the @xmath10 limit of our subleading - order eft provides a derivation of the generalized busch _",
    "et al . _ relation @xcite .",
    "with the two - body system thus understood , we can use our method to calculate the energies of larger trapped systems @xcite .",
    "other approaches to the same problem of course exist in the literature .",
    "they are frequently based on a specific form for the interparticle potential ( see , for example , ref .",
    "closest in spirit to ours is probably the approach @xcite where an effective short - range interaction is fitted to several levels of the pseudopotential at unitarity , but diagonalized exactly .",
    "what distinguish our framework are its _ i ) _ systematic character , in the form of a controlled expansion ; and _ ii ) _ generality , since no assumptions about the form of the short - range interactions are needed .",
    "these features allow the same method to apply across fields .",
    "of course , the low - energy observables themselves should be in agreement among different approaches , as long as they are calculated properly .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first show in sec .",
    "[ sect2 ] the general formalism of our approach , including a detailed description of the treatment beyond leading order .",

    "this is merely a consequence of the fact that the uv cutoff is an arbitrary separation between the short - range dynamics included explicitly in the dynamics ( through high virtual momenta ) versus that included implicitly in the potential ( through its parameters ) .",
