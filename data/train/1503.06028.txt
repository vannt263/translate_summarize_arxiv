    "let @xmath0 be a non - empty bounded open subset of @xmath1 for @xmath2 and let @xmath3 be the dirichlet laplacian on @xmath0",
    ". then the spectrum @xmath4 of @xmath5 is discrete and forms a positive increasing sequence @xmath6 where the eigenvalues are repeated according to their multiplicity .",
    "interest in the geometric information about @xmath0 encoded by @xmath4 started a little over 100 years ago and was crystallised by kac in his paper @xcite entitled ` can one hear the shape of a drum ? ' or more precisely , does @xmath4 determine @xmath0 up to isometry ?",
    "the answer to that question is no in general , as shown in @xcite ; see also @xcite for a concise presentation of a family of counterexamples .",
    "however some geometric information about @xmath0 can be recovered .",
    "weyl s theorem shows that the eigenvalue counting function @xmath7 defined by @xmath8 has asymptotic expansion @xmath9 as @xmath10 , for some constant @xmath11 depending only on @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the @xmath12-dimensional lebesgue measure . aside from prompting kac s question this result has led to a large body of work on the behaviour of the eigenvalue counting function and we now give a very brief description of the results that have motivated the work we will present here .    as a first extension it is natural to ask about the second order term in this expansion . if @xmath14 is smooth , then under some assumptions , that there are not too many periodic geodesics , the expansion has a second order term @xmath15 as @xmath10 , for some other constant @xmath16 depending only on @xmath12 . the reader is referred to @xcite and references therein for more information .",
    "this means that , under some regularity conditions , we can recover the size of the domain and that of the boundary from the spectral asymptotics ; in particular , using the isoperimetric inequality , we can determine whether or not @xmath0 is an open ball .",
    "interest in the second term of the expansion of @xmath7 grew further when berry studied the spectral asymptotics of domains with a fractal boundary in @xcite .",
    "he conjectured that the hausdorff dimension of @xmath14 should drive the second order term .",
    "brossard and carmona in @xcite studied the associated partition function , a smoothed version of the eigenvalue counting function , and showed that the minkowski dimension , @xmath17 , was the relevant notion of dimension for the second order term in the short time expansion of this function . for the counting function itself",
    "a general result of lapidus @xcite shows that , if @xmath18 , the second order term is of order @xmath19 provided the minkowski content of the boundary is finite .",
    "in general it is difficult to determine the precise order of growth for the second order term for arbitrary boundaries , however for one - dimensional domains @xcite it was shown that the minkowski dimension captures the order of growth of the second term in the asymptotics and the minkowski content , the constant , when they exist .",
    "the problem of determining the spectral asymptotics has also been considered for sets which are themselves fractal .",
    "for some classes of fractal , such as the sierpinski gasket , or more generally p.c.f .",
    "self - similar sets @xcite or generalised sierpinski carpets @xcite , a laplacian can be defined and shown to have a discrete spectrum .",
    "the exponent for the leading order growth rate in the eigenvalue counting function is called the spectral dimension and differs from the hausdorff or minkowski dimension of the set .",
    "if the fractal has enough symmetry , such as for instance the sierpinski gasket , then a weyl type theorem is no longer true @xcite , @xcite in that the rescaled limit of the eigenvalue counting function does not converge .",
    "however the weyl limit does exist for ` generic ' deterministic p.c.f .",
    "self - similar sets @xcite and also for random sierpinski gaskets @xcite and it is natural to ask about the growth of the second order term in these settings .",
    "our aim is to consider some random fractals where we anticipate more generic behaviour of the counting function .",
    "we will consider both domains with fractal boundaries and fractal sets here .",
    "firstly we will consider the case of open subsets with fractal boundaries in the one - dimensional case of a so called fractal string .",
    "our second case will be an example where the set itself is a fractal , the continuum random tree . in both cases the first order terms in the spectral asymptotics due to the fractal structure",
    "are understood and we will focus on the behaviour of the second order terms .",
    "a fractal string is a set obtained as the complement of a cantor set in the unit interval , so can be thought of as a sequence of intervals of decreasing length @xcite .",
    "the dirichlet laplacian is then the union of the dirichlet laplacians on each interval .",
    "some discussion of the spectral asymptotics of random fractal strings can be found in @xcite where it is shown that for cantor sets constructed via random iterated function systems , the second order term due to the boundary exists almost surely .",
    "we will consider a suitable subset of these random fractal strings and determine when the order of the fluctuations about the boundary term is given by a central limit theorem ( clt ) .",
    "this turns out to be a subtle question and the existence of a clt is determined by the rate of convergence in an associated renewal theorem .",
    "we will give a precise statement after introducing all the terminology in theorem  [ thm::spectralasympstring ] .",
    "we will then show that when the fractal is generated using a dirichlet distribution , the existence of a central limit theorem depends on the particular dirichlet distribution considered .",
    "an example of what we are able to show is the following .",
    "let @xmath20 , for @xmath21 , be the random fractal string obtained as the complement of the random cantor set generated by subdividing any interval of length @xmath22 into three , retaining two intervals of size @xmath23 , and removing one of length @xmath24 , where the pair @xmath25 is independent for each interval and distributed as dirichlet(@xmath26 ) ( that is a beta(@xmath26 ) distribution in this simple case ) and @xmath27 .",
    "we write @xmath28 for the probability law for the random fractal string and @xmath29 for expectation with respect to @xmath28 .",
    "we note that @xmath30 will be the minkowski dimension of the random cantor set @xmath28-almost surely , that is the dimension of the boundary of the string .",
    "we write @xmath31 for the associated eigenvalue counting function .",
    "[ thm : ex1 ] ( i ) for all @xmath32 and @xmath33 there is a strictly positive deterministic constant @xmath34 such that as @xmath35 @xmath36 ( ii ) if @xmath37 , then there exists a strictly positive deterministic constant @xmath38 such that as @xmath35 @xmath39 where @xmath40 is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance @xmath41 .",
    "+ ( iii ) there exists an @xmath42 and a @xmath33 such that : if @xmath43 , then there exists a not - identically - zero periodic function @xmath44 such that @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 and , for this range of @xmath48 we have @xmath49 .",
    "in particular @xmath50 does not converge in distribution as @xmath35 .",
    "\\(1 ) the first result gives the almost sure behaviour of the second term in the counting function asymptotics and is true for random fractal strings constructed using a wide class of distributions on the simplex .",
    "+ ( 2 ) in part ( iii ) we conjecture that it is possible to take @xmath51 and any @xmath52 .",
    "indeed , towards proving the above result , we first provide conditions under which a clt holds ( see theorem [ thm::spectralasympstring ] and section [ subsec::numericalexample ] ) , and explain when one will not ( see remark [ rmk::sharpspeedconvergence ] ) .",
    "this distinction is determined by the rate of convergence in a related renewal theorem and depends on the values of the roots of @xmath53 , which we solve numerically ( we can also solve this equation analytically for small values of @xmath48 ) .",
    "these computations demonstrate that we can take @xmath54 to be at least @xmath55 . furthermore , although we are not able to prove it rigorously , the monotonicity of the results suggests that @xmath54 can be taken arbitrarily large .",
    "+ ( 3 ) we also conjecture that , in the case where there is no clt , i.e.  @xmath56 , the size of the second order term is determined by @xmath57 , in that , @xmath28 almost surely for @xmath58 , @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 as @xmath62 .",
    "+ ( 4 ) the proof of the above result shows that the period of @xmath63 is given by @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is one of the complex conjugate pair of roots whose real part gives @xmath57 .",
    "observe that , as @xmath48 increases , the beta@xmath66 distribution becomes closer to the distribution given by a delta measure at the point ( 1/2,1/2 ) .",
    "if we take @xmath67 , then we anticipate that our random fractal string should converge ( in a suitable sense ) to the cantor string ( the string formed as the complement of the classical ternary cantor set ) as @xmath48 goes to infinity .",
    "it is known that for the cantor string there is a non - constant periodic function that appears in the second order term in the counting function asymptotics @xcite .",
    "thus our result suggests that there is a non - trivial transition in the parameter space from the case where there is ` enough randomness ' for a clt about the second order term , to the case where there is not , through to the limit , where there is not even a strong law of large numbers for this term .",
    "we will also consider the case of the brownian continuum random tree , a random self - similar fractal .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that there was a weyl limit for the counting function in this case .",
    "it was also shown that the second order term for this fractal set was of order 1 in mean  which would be anticipated as the boundary of the tree is just two points , a 0-dimensional set . in this paper",
    "we show that there is a clt about the almost sure asymptotics .",
    "however at this point we have not shown strict positivity of the variance due to the complexity of the correlation structure in the variance of the limit of the rescaled counting function .",
    "we conjecture that there will be a non - trivial clt for this counting function",
    ". this will show that the randomness in the construction means the second order term in the spectral asymptotics is determined by the fluctuations about the leading order term , as these are much greater than the effects due to the boundary of the set .",
    "the main technical tool we develop is a central limit theorem for the general crump - mode - jagers branching process . in our setting the random fractal sets , the random cantor set boundary of the string , or the continuum random tree , can be encoded as general branching processes .",
    "we are able to use a characteristic associated with these processes to determine the behaviour of the counting function . in this case",
    "there may be dependence on the offspring of an individual and we obtain a clt in this more general setting , extending the work of @xcite .",
    "we also remark that the techniques used here can easily be applied to geometric counting functions or other functions associated with heat flow , such as the partition function or heat content of the set .",
    "we anticipate similar behaviour in the fluctuations of these quantities about their almost sure limits .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ bpcltsec ]",
    ", we recall the definition of the general branching process and some laws of large numbers for such processes .",
    "we then prove our central limit theorem for the general branching process using a taylor expansion proof . in section [ sec::dirichletweights ] , we restrict ourselves to general branching processes where a suitable function of the birth times is chosen to lie on an @xmath68-dimensional simplex , which will ensure that the limit of the usual branching process martingale is a constant .",
    "we will call such processes @xmath69-gbps and discuss extensively how to establish the conditions required for the central limit theorem in this setting as this will allow us to illustrate when we do and do not have a central limit theorem for the associated general branching process . in section [ sec::cantorstrings ] ,",
    "we define a family of open subsets @xmath70 of @xmath71 $ ] whose random boundary is a statistically self - similar cantor set built using scale factors on the simplex .",
    "we are then able to show our main result which gives conditions for the existence of a central limit theorem . in section 5",
    "we consider some examples where the law of the @xmath69-gbp is given by a dirichlet distribution .",
    "we show that , for some dirichlet weights , the eigenvalue counting function of the set @xmath70 satisfies a central limit theorem . as a consequence",
    "we will be able to establish theorem  [ thm : ex1 ] . in section  6",
    "we turn to the continuum random tree .",
    "we recall that this tree can be viewed as a random self - similar set and how to construct a laplace operator on it .",
    "we then show that the conditions for the general branching process central limit theorem hold and hence there is a clt in the spectral asymptotics .      for convenience , we will use the shorthand notation @xmath72 with @xmath73 to mean some positive constant whose value is fixed for the length of a proof or a subsection .",
