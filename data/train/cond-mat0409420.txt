    "when the lattice constant of a metallic system is sufficiently enlarged it will become an insulator , before eventually we end up with a collection of well separated atoms .",
    "this metal to insulator transition was first pointed out by mott ( [ ] and references therein ) and has stimulated a tremendous amount of work for a better understanding of it .",
    "the standard model for these investigations has been the hubbard hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "it assumes one orbital per site and the electronic coulomb interactions are reduced to an on - site coulomb integral @xmath3 . by applying",
    "different approximations hubbard was able to quantify the conditions for the occurrence of a m - i phase transition .",
    "for that reason it is often called a mott - hubbard transition .",
    "more recently , the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) has been applied to the hubbard hamiltonian with one electron per site and has further elucidated details of the transition ( for an overview and further references see , e.g. , [ ] ) .",
    "+ the purpose of the present work is to go beyond the hubbard model in order to understand better how other features might influence the transition in a realistic system .",
    "lithium is a metal with a strong contribution of @xmath1 electrons to the conduction band . with increasing lattice constant the ratio of @xmath1 and @xmath2 electrons is changing and in the atomic limit we are dealing with a pure @xmath4 atomic state .",
    "one of the questions we would like to have answered is the effect of low - energy atomic excitations from @xmath5 to @xmath6 on the m - i transition . in order to come close to a realistic description of metallic systems",
    "we investigate a ring of li atoms applying quantum - chemical methods for a treatment of electronic correlations . + in terms of a hubbard model",
    "the li - li distance would correspond to the hopping term @xmath7 . instead of only an on - site coulomb repulsion as in the hubbard model",
    "we take here into account all possible coulomb matrix elements .",
    "but in the limit of large seperations of atoms only the on - site coulomb repulsion remains .",
    "+ the largest ring which we can treat at the multi - reference configuration - interaction ( mrci ) level , without excessive computations , consists of 10 li atoms . a medium - size basis set consisting of gaussian type orbitals ( gto s ) is used in the calculations .",
    "usually the onset of insulating behaviour is characterized by the appearance of a gap . however , with a finite number of li atoms in the ring we always have a finite energy difference between consecutive energy levels .",
    "therefore , when the atomic distance is changed we must look for a change in the pattern between the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) and the lowest unoccupied orbital ( lumo ) .",
    "these quantities are only accessible at the mean - field level . at the correlated level , we select three quantities which can give insight as regards the transition behaviour .",
    "mrci methods can yield very good approximations to the exact ground - state wavefunction .",
    "the character of this wave function will be the first criterion .",
    "a second quantity which we calculate is the one - particle energy gap defined as the energy difference which is obtained if an electron is added to , or removed from the system . as a third quantity , we determine the static dipole polarizability of the system by applying a small homogeneous electric field .",
    "these three quantities are determined as functions of the nearest - neighbour li - li distance in the ring , and we discuss how the metal - insulator transition shows up in them . for these quasi - one - dimensional systems , the question arises whether we can gain energy by dimerization ( peierls distortion ) .",
    "we address this question by allowing for a bond alternation .",
    "+ in the next section we will discuss some technical details ( sect .",
    "ii ) . in sect .",
    "iii , we present the results of different mean - field methods , for li rings with increasing number of li atoms and with increasing li  li distance .",
    "the behaviour of the many - body wavefunction is discussed in sect .",
    "gap energies are presented in sect .",
    "v and polarizabilities in sect .",
    "vi . the peierls distortion is considered in sect . vii and conclusions follow in sect .",
    "the application of quantum - chemical _ ab - initio _ methods to li rings is at the focus of the present work .",
    "starting from a mean - field hartree - fock ( hf ) description , we re - optimize the valence wavefunction in multi - configuration self - consistent - field ( mcscf ) calculations , keeping the @xmath8 core electrons frozen at the hf level .",
    "thereby , the number of valence active - space orbitals is chosen equal to ( or larger than ) the number of li atoms of the system , and all possible occupations of these orbitals are accounted for .    .",
    "[ basis ] acpf values of the ionization potential ( ip ) , the electron affinity ( ea ) , and the dipole polarizibility ( @xmath9 ) of the li atom are listed for different basis sets .",
    "corresponding values for the bond length ( @xmath10 ) of the li@xmath11 molecule are listed , too . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]                    molpro version 2002.6 - a package of _ ab - initio _ programs written by h .- j .",
