    "in this paper , we seek solutions of steady , relativistic , magnetised axisymmetric jets propagating through an unmagnetised ambient medium at rest .",
    "units are used in which the light speed ( @xmath1 ) , the ambient density ( @xmath2 ) and the radius of the jet ( @xmath3 ) are set to unity .",
    "both the jet and the ambient medium plasmas are assumed to behave as a perfect gas with constant adiabatic index @xmath4 .    in order to make the problem tractable",

    "using cylindrical coordinates ( referred to an orthonormal cylindrical basis @xmath5 ) in which the jets propagate along the @xmath6 axis , axisymmetry implies that there is no dependence on the azimuthal cylindrical coordinate , @xmath7 . in the first part of the paper",

    "this means that the radial magnetic field , @xmath8 , is zero .",
    "finally , this symmetry condition together with the assumed stationarity of the flow , forces the radial velocity , @xmath9 , to be zero too .",
    "hence the jet solutions are characterised by six functions , namely the density and the pressure , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , and the two remaining components of the velocity , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and of the magnetic field , @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",

    "by contrast , the lines displayed in the right panels of figs .",
    "[ f2 ] and specially in those of fig.[f2prime ] , occupy a different region in the pitch angle / magnetisation diagram .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that for rotating jet models there is another forbidden region beyond the left ends of the lines and towards the bottom - left corner . in this region",
    "( forbidden region iii ) , models of the kind analyzed in this work would have sections with negative gas pressure for given azimuthal velocity profile due to the centrifugal force .",
