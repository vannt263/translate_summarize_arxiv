    ", unlike @xmath70 or @xmath58 , which can handle only @xmath61 .    the distance measure @xmath0 has appeared in a wide variety of applications .",
    "these include statistical hypothesis testing , of homogeneity @xcite , independence @xcite , and conditional independence @xcite ; as well as in machine learning applications including kernel independent component analysis @xcite and kernel based dimensionality reduction for supervised learning @xcite . in these applications ,",
    "kernels offer a linear approach to deal with higher order statistics : given the problem of homogeneity testing , for example , differences in higher order moments are encoded as differences in the means of nonlinear features of the variables . to capture all nonlinearities that are relevant to the problem at hand",
    ", the embedding rkhs therefore has to be  sufficiently large \" that differences in the embeddings correspond to differences of interest in the distributions .",
    "thus , a natural question is how to guarantee @xmath1 provides a sufficiently rich rkhs so as to detect _ any _ difference in distributions .",
    "a second problem is to determine what properties of distributions result in their being proximate or distant in the embedding space .",
    "finally , we would like to compare @xmath0 to the classical integral probability metrics listed earlier , when used to measure convergence of distributions . in the following section ,",
    "we describe the contributions of the present paper , addressing each of these three questions in turn .",
    "the contributions in this paper are three - fold and explained in detail below .",
    "recently , @xcite introduced the concept of a _ characteristic kernel _",
    ", i.e. , a reproducing kernel for which @xmath71 , @xmath72 , i.e. , @xmath0 is a metric on @xmath19 .",
    "the corresponding rkhs , @xmath44 is referred to as a _",
    "characteristic rkhs_. the following are two characterizations for characteristic rkhss that have already been studied in literature :    1 .",
    "when @xmath13 is compact , @xcite showed that @xmath44 is characteristic if @xmath1 is _ universal _ in the sense of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 4 ) , i.e. , @xmath44 is dense in the banach space of bounded continuous functions with respect to the supremum norm . examples of such @xmath44 include those induced by the gaussian and laplacian kernels on every compact subset of @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite extended this characterization to non - compact @xmath13 and showed that @xmath44 is characteristic if and only if the direct sum of @xmath44 and @xmath73 is dense in the banach space of @xmath74-integrable ( for some @xmath75 ) functions . using this characterization",
    ", they showed that the rkhss induced by the gaussian and laplacian kernels ( supported on the entire @xmath2 ) are characteristic .    in the present study",
    ", we provide alternative conditions for characteristic rkhss which address several limitations of the foregoing .",
    "first , it can be difficult to verify the conditions of denseness in both of the above characterizations .",
    "second , universality is in any case an overly restrictive condition because universal kernels assume @xmath13 to be compact , i.e. , they induce a metric only on the space of probability measures that are supported on compact @xmath13 . in addition , there are compactly supported kernels which are not universal , e.g. , @xmath76-splines @xcite , which can be shown to be characteristic .    in section  [ subsec : strictpd ] , we present the simple characterization that _ integrally strictly positive definite _",
    "( pd ) kernels ( see section  [ sec : notation ] for the definition ) are characteristic , i.e. , the induced rkhs is characteristic ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4 ) .",
    "this condition is more natural    strict pd is a natural property of interest for kernels , unlike the denseness condition    and much easier to understand than the characterizations mentioned above",
    ". examples of integrally strictly pd kernels on @xmath2 include the gaussian , laplacian , inverse multiquadratics , matrn kernel family , @xmath76-splines , etc .",
    "although the above characterization of integrally strictly pd kernels being characteristic is simple to understand , it is only a sufficient condition and does not provide an answer for kernels that are not integrally strictly pd , ) .",
    "therefore , examples of kernels that are not integrally strictly pd include those kernels that are not strictly pd . ] e.g. , a dirichlet kernel . therefore , in section  [ subsec : rd ] , we provide an easily checkable condition , after making some assumptions on the kernel .",
    "we present a complete characterization of characteristic kernels when the kernel is translation invariant on @xmath2 .",
    "we show that a bounded continuous translation invariant kernel on @xmath2 is characteristic if and only if the support of the fourier transform of the kernel is the entire @xmath2 .",
    "this condition is easy to check compared to the characterizations described above",
    ". an earlier version of this result was provided by @xcite : by comparison , we now present a simpler and more elegant proof .",
    "we also show that all compactly supported translation invariant kernels on @xmath2 are characteristic .",
    "note , however , that the characterization of integral strict positive definiteness in section  [ subsec : strictpd ] does not assume @xmath13 to be @xmath2 nor @xmath1 to be translation invariant .",
    "we extend the result of section  [ subsec : rd ] to @xmath13 being a @xmath62-torus , i.e. , @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is a circle . in section  [ subsec : td ] , we show that a translation invariant kernel on @xmath79 is characteristic if and only if the fourier series coefficients of the kernel are positive , i.e. , the support of the fourier spectrum is the entire @xmath80 .",
    "the proof of this result is similar in flavor to the one in section  [ subsec : rd ] . as examples",
    ", the poisson kernel can be shown to be characteristic , while the dirichlet kernel is not .",
    "based on the discussion so far , it is clear that the characteristic property of @xmath1 is characterized in many ways . given these characterizations , we would like to understand the relation betweeen them .",
    "for example , we know that if @xmath1 is universal , then it is characteristic . is the converse true ?",
    "similarly , as we mentioned before , integrally strictly pd kernels are characteristic and are also also strictly pd .",
    "then what is the relation between characteristic and strictly pd kernels ? in section  [ subsec : relation ] , we address these questions by exploring the relation between these characterizations , which are summarized in figure  [ fig : relation ] .      as we have seen , the characteristic property of a kernel is critical in distinguishing between distinct probability measures .",
    "suppose , however , that for a given characteristic kernel @xmath1 and for any @xmath81 , there exist @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath82 , such that @xmath83 .",
    "though @xmath1 distinguishes between such @xmath7 and @xmath8 , it can be difficult to tell the distributions apart in applications ( even with characteristic kernels ) , since @xmath7 and @xmath8 are then replaced with finite samples , and the distance between them may not be statistically significant @xcite .",
    "therefore , given a characteristic kernel , it is of interest to determine the properties of distributions @xmath7 and @xmath8 that will cause their embeddings to be close . to this end , in section  [ sec :",
    "limitation ] , we show that given a kernel @xmath1 ( see theorem  [ thm : generic ] for conditions on the kernel ) , for any @xmath81 , there exists @xmath82 ( with non - trivial differences between them ) such that @xmath84 .",
    "these distributions are constructed so as to differ at a sufficiently high frequency , which is then penalized by the rkhs norm when computing @xmath0 .",
    "given @xmath0 , which is a metric on @xmath19 , a natural question of theoretical and practical importance to ask is  how is @xmath0 related to other probability metrics , such as the dudley metric ( @xmath85 ) , wasserstein distance ( @xmath86 ) , total variation metric ( @xmath31 ) , etc ? \" for example , in applications like density estimation , wherein the unknown density is estimated based on finite samples drawn i.i.d . from it , the quality of the estimate is measured by computing the distance between the true density and the estimated density .",
    "in such a setting , given two probability metrics , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , one might want to use the _ _ stronger _ _ and @xmath89 are said to be equivalent if @xmath90 . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath87 is said to be stronger than @xmath88 if @xmath91 but not vice - versa .",
    "if @xmath87 is stronger than @xmath88 , then we say @xmath88 is weaker than @xmath87 .",
    "note that if @xmath87 is stronger ( _ resp .",
    "_ weaker ) than @xmath88 , then the topology induced by @xmath87 is finer ( _ resp . _",
    "coarser ) than the one induced by @xmath88.[fnote : strong - weak ] ] of the two to determine this distance , as the convergence of the estimated density to the true density in the stronger metric implies the convergence in the weaker metric , while the converse is not true . on the other hand",
    ", one might need to use a metric of weaker topology ( i.e. , coarser topology ) to show convergence of some estimators , as the convergence might not occur w.r.t .",
    "a metric of strong topology . clarifying and comparing",
    "the topology of a metric on the probabilities is , thus , important in the analysis of density estimation .",
    "based on this motivation , in section  [ sec : weak ] , we analyze the relation between @xmath0 and other probability metrics , and show that @xmath0 is weaker than all these other metrics .",
    "it is well known in probability theory that @xmath85 is weaker than @xmath86 and @xmath31 , and it metrizes the weak topology ( we will provide formal definitions in section  [ sec : weak ] ) on @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "since @xmath0 is weaker than all these other probability metrics , i.e. , the topology induced by @xmath0 is coarser than the one induced by these metrics , the next interesting question to answer would be ,  when does @xmath0 metrize the weak topology on @xmath19 ? \" in other words , for what @xmath1 , does the topology induced by @xmath0 coincides with the weak topology ? answering this question would show that @xmath0 is equivalent to @xmath85 , while it is weaker than @xmath86 and @xmath31 .",
    "in probability theory , the metrization of weak topology is of prime importance in proving results related to the weak convergence of probability measures .",
    "therefore , knowing the answer to the above question will help in using @xmath0 as a theoretical tool in probability theory . to this end , in section  [ sec : weak ] , we show that universal kernels on compact @xmath26 metrize the weak topology on @xmath19 .",
    "for the non - compact setting , we assume @xmath61 and provide sufficient conditions on the kernel such that @xmath0 metrizes the weak topology on @xmath19 .",
    "+    in the following section , we introduce the notation and some definitions that are used throughout the paper .",

    "@xmath762 is the family of gaussian kernels and @xmath763 is the associated family of distance measures indexed by the kernel parameter , @xmath624 .",
    "note that @xmath764 is characteristic for any @xmath765 and , therefore , @xmath766 is a metric on @xmath19 for any @xmath765 . in practice",
    ", one would prefer a single number that defines the distance between @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",

    "this means choosing _ sufficiently small _ or _ sufficiently large _",
    "@xmath624 ( depending on @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) makes @xmath775 arbitrarily small .",
    "therefore , @xmath624 must be chosen appropriately in applications to effectively distinguish between @xmath7 and @xmath8 .    to this end",
    ", one can consider the following modification to @xmath0 , which yields a pseudometric on @xmath19 , @xmath776 note that @xmath12 is the maximal rkhs distance between @xmath7 and @xmath8 over a family , @xmath777 of measurable and bounded positive definite kernels .",
    "it is easy to check that , if any @xmath778 is characteristic , then @xmath12 is a metric on @xmath668 .",

    "this also yields a pseudometric on @xmath19 .",
    "that said , @xmath791 , which means that , if @xmath7 and @xmath8 can be distinguished by @xmath499 , then they can be distinguished by @xmath12 , but not vice - versa . in this sense",
    ", @xmath12 is stronger than @xmath499 and therefore studying @xmath12 makes sense .",
    "one further complication with the bayesian approach is in defining a sensible @xmath390 over @xmath777 .",

    "future work will include analyzing @xmath12 and investigating its utility in applications compared to that of @xmath0 ( with a fixed kernel , @xmath1 ) .",
    "refer to @xcite for some preliminary work , wherein we showed that @xmath795 is a @xmath64-consistent estimator of @xmath796 , for the class @xmath777 of kernels shown in the previous page .",
    "we now discuss how kernels on @xmath19 can be obtained from @xmath0 . as discussed in the paper",
    ", @xmath0 is a _",
    "hilbertian metric _ on @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , using ( [ eq : hilb - kernel ] ) , the associated kernel can be easily computed as @xmath797 where @xmath798 is a positive definite kernel , which can be seen as the dot - product kernel on @xmath19 . using the results in (",
    "* chapter 3 , theorems 2.2 and 2.3 ) , gaussian and inverse multi - quadratic kernels on @xmath19 can be defined as @xmath799 respectively .",
