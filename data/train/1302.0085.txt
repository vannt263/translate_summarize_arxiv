    "in problems like effective modeling of random media , the continuum models of percolation are more realistic than their lattice counterparts .",
    "so , much effort has been put into the study of such systems in the recent past . in two dimensions ,",
    "the model systems studied involve discs , squares etc . of the same size or of different sizes @xcite and in three dimensions spheres , cubes etc . , distributed randomly in space @xcite",
    ". an interesting sub - class of problems is where the basic percolating units have an unbounded size distribution .",
    "these are comparatively less studied , though a few formal results are available @xcite .",
    "the problem of disc percolation where discs have bounded sizes has been studied a lot , mainly by simulation @xcite . for the single sized disc percolation",
    ", threshold is known to a very high degree of accuracy @xcite .",
    "also simulation studies have shown that the disc percolation in 2d with discs of bounded size falls in the same universality class as that of lattice percolation in 2d @xcite . for a review of continuum percolation see @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider continuum percolation model of overlapping discs in 2d where distribution of the radii of the discs has a power - law tail .",
    "we address questions like whether the power - law tail in the distribution of radii changes the critical behavior of the system , and how does the percolation threshold depend on the power of the power - law tail . from an application point of view , a power - law polydispersity for an extended range of object sizes is quite common in nature especially for fractal systems @xcite .",
    "disordered systems like carbonate rocks often contain pores of widely varied sizes covering many decades in length scales @xcite , whose geometry may be well modeled by a power - law distribution of pore sizes .",
    "the power - law distribution of the radii makes our system similar to the ising or fluid system with long - range interactions . for the latter case",
    ", it is known that the long - range nature of the interaction does affect the critical behavior of the system for slow enough decay of the interaction @xcite . for similar results in the context of long - range epidemic processes ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the behavior of our model differs from that of the standard continuum percolation model in two aspects .",
    "firstly the entire low density regime in our model shows a power - law decay of the two - point function in contrast to the exponential decay in the standard continuum percolation .",
    "thus the whole low density regime is critical .",
    "however , there is a non - zero percolation threshold below which there is no infinite cluster exist in the system .",
    "secondly the critical exponents are functions of the power @xmath5 of the power - law distribution for low enough @xmath5 .",
    "so while the system belong to the same universality class as the standard continuum percolation for high enough @xmath5 , the critical behavior is quite different for low values of @xmath5 .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in section [ sec2 ] , we define the model of disc percolation precisely . in section [ sec3 ] , using a rigorous lower bound on the two - point correlation function , we show it decays only as a power - law with distance for arbitrarily low coverage densities .",
    "we discuss the two - point function and critical exponents . in section [ sec5 ] , we propose an approximate renormalization scheme to calculate the correlation length exponent @xmath9 and the percolation threshold in such models . in section [ sec6 ] ,",
    "we discuss results from simulation and section [ sec7 ] contains some concluding remarks .",
    "we consider a continuum percolation model of overlapping discs in two dimensions .",
    "the number density of discs is @xmath12 , and the probability that any small area element @xmath13 has the center of a disc in it is @xmath14 , independent of all other area elements . for each disc , we assign a radius , independently of other discs , from a probability distribution @xmath15 .",
    "we consider the case when @xmath15 has a power - law tail ; the probability of radius being greater than @xmath0 varies as @xmath16 for large @xmath0 . for simplicity",
    ", we consider the case when radii take only discrete values @xmath17 where @xmath18 , with probabilities @xmath19 where @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 is the size of smallest disc , and @xmath22 is a constant @xmath23 .",
    "we call the disc of size @xmath17 as the disc of type @xmath24 .",
    "the fraction of the entire plane which is covered by at least one disc , called the covered area fraction @xmath25 , is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the areal density - mean area of the discs per unit area of the plane - of the discs , which is finite only for @xmath3 . for @xmath8 , in the thermodynamic limit all points of the plane are eventually covered , and @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath3 , we have areal density , @xmath29    we define the percolation probability @xmath30 as the probability that a randomly chosen disc belongs to an infinite cluster of overlapping discs .",
    "one expects that there is a critical number density @xmath31 such that for @xmath32 , @xmath30 is exactly zero , but @xmath33 , for @xmath34 .",
    "we shall call the phase @xmath32 the non - percolating phase , and the phase @xmath35 as the percolating phase .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath36 .",
    "we note that for percolation of discs where all discs have the same size @xmath21 , there is a finite critical number density @xmath37 , such that for @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "then , for the polydisperse case , where all discs have radii @xmath21 or larger , the percolation probability can only increase , and hence @xmath40 . also it has been proved that when ever we have a bounded distribution of radii of the discs , the critical areal density is greater than that for a system with single sized discs @xcite .",
    "our simulation results show that this remains valid for unbounded distribution of radii of the discs .",
    "we define two point function @xmath41 as the probability that points @xmath42 and @xmath43 in the plane are connected by overlapping discs . then",
    ", by rotational invariance of the problem , @xmath44 is only a function of the euclidean distance @xmath45 between the two points .",
    "let @xmath46 denote the probability that there is at least one disc that covers both @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "then , clearly , @xmath47     from each other will be covered by a single disc of radius @xmath0 , if the center of such a disc falls in the area of intersection of two circles with radius @xmath0 and centers at 1 and 2 . ]",
    "it is straightforward to estimate @xmath48 for our model .",
    "let @xmath24 be the minimum number such that radius of disc of type @xmath24 is greater than or equal to @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath49 . let @xmath50 be the region of plane such that the distance of any point in @xmath50 from @xmath42 or @xmath43 is less than or equal to @xmath51 . this region @xmath50 is greater than or equal to the region where each point is within a distance @xmath45 from both @xmath42 and @xmath43 . using elementary geometry",

    "the number density of discs with radius greater than or equal to @xmath17 is @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , the probability that there is at least one such disc in the region @xmath50 is @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the area of region @xmath50 .",
    "thus we get , @xmath56 \\label{eq4}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 .    now , clearly , @xmath58 .",
    "hence we have @xmath59 . putting this in eq .",
    "[ eq4 ] , we get @xmath60 \\label{eq5}\\ ] ] where some constant factors have been absorbed into @xmath61 . for large @xmath45 , it is easy to see that this varies as @xmath62",
    ". hence the two - point correlation function is bounded from below by a power - law .",
    "we can extend this calculation , and write the two - point correlation function as an expansion @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the probability that the path of overlapping discs connecting points @xmath42 and @xmath43 requires @xmath12 discs .",
    "the term @xmath65 corresponds to a more complicated integral over two overlapping discs .",
    "but it easy to see that for large @xmath45 , this also decays as @xmath66 . assuming that similar behavior holds for higher order terms as well , we expect that for all non - zero densities @xmath12 , the two - point correlation function decays as a power law even for arbitrarily low densities of discs .",
    "we note that this is consistent with the result that for continuum percolation in @xmath67 dimensions , the diameter of the connected component containing the origin say @xmath68 is divergent even for arbitrarily small number densities when @xmath69 is divergent @xcite . here",
    "@xmath0 denote the radii variable . in our case @xmath70 ( where @xmath42 is the origin )",
    "is divergent when @xmath71 , consistent with the above .",
    "the power - law decay of the two - point function is the result of the fact that for any distance @xmath72 , we have discs of radii of the order of @xmath72 .",
    "however for large values of @xmath72 , we can imagine that there would also be a contribution from a large number of overlapping discs of radii much smaller than @xmath72 connecting the two points separated by the distance @xmath72 , which as in the usual percolation problem decays exponentially with distance .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to write the two point function in our problem as a sum of two parts ; the first part say @xmath73 due to the short range connections which has an exponential decay with distance for large @xmath72 and the second one say @xmath74 due to the long range connections which has a power law decay with distance .",
    "therefore , @xmath75 where @xmath76 where @xmath77 is assumed to go to a non - zero constant as @xmath27 goes to its critical value and its dependence on @xmath27 is a slowly varying one .",
    "the power - law distribution of the radii , makes this system similar to a long range interaction problem in statistical physics in the sense that given two points in the plane , a direct connection by a single disc overlapping both the points is possible .",
    "in fact similar behavior for the two - point function exists whenever we have long range interactions in a system , such as in ising model with long range potentials or fluid with long range interactions @xcite . in such systems ,",
    "the two - point function shows a power - law decay just as in our problem @xcite .",
    "the effect of such long range potentials on the critical exponents have been studied earlier @xcite with the general conclusion that the long range part of the interaction do influence the critical behavior of the system @xcite .",
    "more precisely , if we have an attractive pair potential in @xmath67 dimensions of the form @xmath78 where @xmath79 , then critical exponents take their short - range values for all @xmath80 where @xmath7 is the anomalous dimension ( for the short range problem in 2d , at criticality , the two point function decays with distance as @xmath81 ) . for @xmath82 ,",
    "two kinds of behavior exist . for @xmath83",
    ", the exponents take their mean - field values and for @xmath84 , the exponents depend on the value of @xmath85 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "so @xmath86 is the dividing line between the region dominated by short range interactions and the region dominated by long - range interactions .    though there is a well established connection between the lattice percolation problem and the ising model @xcite",
    ", there is no similar result connecting the continuum percolation problem to any simple hamiltonian system .",
    "however , the following simple argument provide us with a prediction about the values of the parameter @xmath5 for which the power - law nature of the distribution is irrelevant and the system is similar to a continuum percolation system with a bounded size distribution for the percolating units . assuming that the strength of the long range interaction from a given point in the ising / fluid system ( which decays like @xmath87 in 2d ) is like the strength of the connectivity from the center of a given disc which is given by the distribution of the radii ; in our problem , we expect the dividing line between the region dominated by short - range connectivity and the region dominated by long - range connectivity to be the same as that for an ising system with long range potential of the form @xmath88 where @xmath89",
    ". then the results for the long - range ising system discussed in the last paragraph should carry over with @xmath90 .",
    "so for our problem , a deviation from the standard critical behavior is expected when @xmath91 and the critical exponents will take their short - range values for @xmath92 . for 2d percolation , @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "also mean - field behavior is expected when @xmath94 .",
    "however for this range of @xmath5 , the entire plane is covered for all non - zero number densities and hence there is no phase transition . in the next two sections , we investigate for the dependence of exponents on the power - law tail of the distribution of the radii of the discs .",
    "first we develop an approximate rg method .",
    "then we carry out simulation studies which show that the correlation length exponent @xmath9 takes its short range value for @xmath10 , while it depends upon @xmath5 for @xmath95 .",
    "in this section , we propose an approximate rg method to analyze the behavior of continuum percolation models near the percolation threshold , when the percolating units have a distribution of sizes .",
    "we assume that we can replace discs of one size having a number density @xmath12 with discs of another size and number density @xmath96 , provided the correlation length remains the same .",
    "application of a similar idea in disc percolation problem with only two sizes of discs may be found in @xcite .",
    "we will illustrate the method by considering a problem in which the radii of discs take only two possible values , say @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "let their areal densities be @xmath99 and @xmath100 respectively , and assume that both @xmath99 and @xmath100 are below @xmath101 , the critical threshold for the percolation problem with only single sized discs present ( @xmath102 @xcite ) .",
    "also let @xmath103 represent the correlation length when only discs of size @xmath97 are present in the system and @xmath104 represent that when only discs of size @xmath98 are present .",
    "invariance of the two point function under length rescaling requires that the expression for the correlation length @xmath105 is of the form @xmath106 , where the function @xmath107 determines how the correlation length depends on the areal density @xmath27 and is independent of the radius @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath108 is the areal density of the discs of size @xmath98 which will give the same correlation length as the discs of size @xmath97 .",
    "i.e , @xmath109 or @xmath110 given the form of the function @xmath107 , we can invert the above equation to find @xmath108 . formally , @xmath111 so the problem is reduced to one in which only discs of size @xmath98 are present , whose net areal density is now given by , @xmath112 system percolates when @xmath113 .",
    "now , when areal density @xmath27 is close to @xmath101 , we have @xmath114 where @xmath115 is some constant independent of @xmath27 and @xmath9 is the correlation - length exponent in the usual percolation problem . using this in eq .",
    "[ eq13 ] , we get @xmath116 therefore , for a given value of @xmath117 , the areal density of discs of radius @xmath98 , so that the system becomes critical is given by , @xmath118 so the total areal density at the percolation threshold is , @xmath119 where @xmath120 . without loss of generality",
    "we may assume @xmath121 .",
    "then @xmath122 and we can see from the above expression that the percolation threshold @xmath123 , a result well known from both theoretical studies @xcite and simulation studies @xcite",
    ".    now in our problem assume that areal density of discs of type @xmath124 do not exceed @xmath101 .",

    "we can see that a very good collapse is obtained .",
    "similar good collapse is obtained for other values of @xmath5 as well .     with @xmath12 ( top row ) and the scaling collapse ( bottom row ) for @xmath234 ( on left ) and @xmath235 ( on right ) .",
    "in this paper , we discuss the effect of a power - law distribution of the radii on the critical behavior of a disc percolation system .",
    "if the distribution of radii is bounded , then one would expect the critical exponents to be unchanged and would be the same as that for standard percolation .",
    "however , if the distribution of radii has a power - law tail , we show that this strongly influence the nature of the phase transition .",
    "the whole of the low - density non - percolating phase has power - law decay of correlations in contrast to the exponential decay for the standard percolation and this occurs for any value of the power @xmath5 , howsoever large .",
    "the critical exponents depend on the value of @xmath5 for @xmath236 and take their short - range values for @xmath237 .",
    "we also propose an approximate rg scheme to analyse such systems .",
    "using this , we compute the correlation - length exponent and the percolation threshold .",
    "the approximate rg scheme is good only for @xmath237 .",
    "monte - carlo simulation results for the percolation thresholds and the correlation - length exponent are presented .",
    "we can easily extend the discussion to higher dimensions , or other shapes of objects .",
    "it is easy to see that the power law correlations will exist in corresponding problems in higher dimensions as well .",
