    "the bishop - phelps theorem @xcite says that every bounded linear functional can be approximated by norm attaining functionals .",
    "in other words , this means that the set of all norm attaining functionals on a banach space @xmath0 is dense in its dual space @xmath13 .",
    "it was proved by lindenstrauss @xcite in 1963 that , in general , the same result does not work for bounded linear operators .",
