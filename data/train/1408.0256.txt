    "in 1989 shuichi nos won ibm - japan s science prize for his 1984 discovery@xcite of a dynamical hamiltonian approach to gibbs canonical ensemble .",
    "he added a new `` time - scaling '' variable @xmath0 ( and its conjugate momentum @xmath1 ) to the usual list of @xmath2 cartesian degrees of freedom , coupling the kinetic energy to a logarithmic temperature - dependent potential for @xmath0 : @xmath3 multiplying the resulting equations of motion by @xmath0 ( `` scaling the time '' ) gives a set of @xmath4 dynamical motion equations fully consistent with gibbs canonical ensemble , @xmath5 provided that we replace @xmath6 by @xmath7 in the scaled equations of motion .",
    "hoover@xcite soon pointed out the lack of ergodicity for this approach , applied to a harmonic oscillator , and at the same time simplified the derivation of a set of @xmath8 equations of motion only slightly different to nos s : @xmath9/\\tau^2 \\ .\\ ] ] the friction coefficient @xmath10 in these `` nos - hoover '' equations is proportional to nos s @xmath1 .",
    "these equations are _ much _ better behaved numerically and also make the extra @xmath0 variable redundant .",
    "carl dettmann showed@xcite that these same equations follow from a hamiltonian like nos s provided that the dettmann hamiltonian is arbitrarily set equal to zero and the number of degrees of freedom is @xmath2 rather than @xmath11 , @xmath12    hoover and harald posch and franz vesely@xcite investigated the details of these dynamics for the harmonic oscillator and discovered an infinite variety of periodic , toroidal , and chaotic solutions , with the sum of all of these disparate parts equal to the canonical distribution , the product of three gaussian functions , in @xmath13 , in @xmath7 , and in @xmath10 for the oscillator .",
    "bauer , bulgac , and kusnezov@xcite generalized the thermostating approach to include two or more control variables , even managing to reproduce brownian motion by using three of them . soon after , martyna , klein , and tuckerman@xcite suggested the use of a chain of thermostat variables to enhance ergodicity .",
    "their equations of motion ( for the shortest chain and with all the free parameters equal to unity ) are : @xmath14\\ ] ] presently , hoover and holian suggested a different dual - control approach@xcite , fixing both the second and fourth velocity moments : @xmath15\\ ] ] equations controlling the sixth or higher moments tend to be too stiff for practical use .",
    "very recently patra and bhattacharya@xcite took a different direction , stimulated by work on the `` configurational temperature '' , as opposed to the usual kinetic one . for the oscillator the configurational temperature@xcite is proportional to the potential energy , @xmath16 .",
    "patra and bhattacharya had the clever idea of imposing both temperatures simultaneously on the oscillator .",
    "their feedback equations use one friction coefficient , @xmath10 , to control kinetic temperature , and the other , @xmath17 , to control configurational temperature , @xmath18 : @xmath19\\ ] ] we wish to emphasize that all three approaches followed here , martyna - klein - tuckerman , hoover - holian , and patra - bhattacharya , if ergodic , provide _ exactly the same _ four - dimensional gaussian distribution , @xmath20 to prove that this is so it is only necessary to evaluate liouville s continuity equation for the flow in phase space , showing that the four - dimensional gaussian distribution is stationary : @xmath21\\ ] ] @xmath22    let us turn to the question of establishing ergodicity for the three dynamical models , mkt , hh , and pb . our own approach , because we know it best , is computational .",
    "it is possible that a more convincing `` rigor mortis '' approach could be developed from a mathematical standpoint . at the moment _",
    "any _ `` proof '' of ergodicity is an `` open problem '' . in seven brief sections",
    "we describe some of the methods that have been applied to this problem@xcite , ending with a challenge for the reader .",
    "because kinetic temperature is the second velocity moment it is usual to confirm that the first few velocity moments agree with the canonical distribution .",
    "a short fourth - order runge - kutta calculation , adding @xmath23 to the list of righthandsides being integrated , shows that the second , fourth , and sixth moments of the mkt and hh equations match the values expected from a gaussian , ( 1 , 3 , 15 ) to three or four significant figures while the pb model gives instead ( 1.000 , 3.8 , 23.5 )",
    ". these results are conclusive evidence that only the mkt and hh equations are candidates for ergodicity",
    ". nevertheless we will apply each of our numerical tests to all three sets of motion equations , in order to see the difference between the difficult and the easy .",
    "the projections of the four - dimensional dynamics onto _ any _ plane , such as the @xmath24 planes , should look gaussian _ without any holes_. for simplicity we use the initial condition @xmath25 with the other variables initially zero , promoting chaos for all three sets of equations .",
    "the mkt and hh equations both appear to have a small hole near the origin of the @xmath26 plane .",
    "the pb equations produce a very different pattern , showing a strong positive correlation between the two variables , another indication that these equations though sometimes chaotic , are not ergodic .",
    "see * figure 1 * for a comparison of the three models in the @xmath27 planar projection .",
    "these results suggest two further checks , a look at the density near the @xmath27 origin and a search for periodic orbits , which would be necessary in order that any holes form in the gaussian distributions .",
    "the probability density for the four - dimensional gaussian at a radius of @xmath28 has decreased from its maximum value at the @xmath29 origin by a factor of @xmath30 = e^{-r^2/2 } = e^{-0.005 } \\simeq 1.00000 - 0.00500 + 0.00001 = 0.99501 \\ , \\ ] ] so that the densities determined from trajectories should hardly vary within that four - dimensional sphere _ provided that the flow is ergodic_. measuring density requires considerably longer runs because the time interval between visits near the origin increases at least as rapidly as @xmath31 .",
    "we measured the probability densities for the mkt and hh algorithms inside @xmath27 circles of area @xmath32 using a billion timesteps , and found no significant difference in density over that range .",
    "evidently the mkt and hh algorithms behave as though they were ergodic .",
    "the difference between those densities and the pb chaotic density was approximately a factor of two , indicating that approximately half the pb measure is chaotic and the other half quasiperiodic , and so omitted from this chaotic simulation .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the mkt equations have two fixed points , though in the end neither one is actually attractive . in the special case",
    "that @xmath13 and @xmath7 both vanish so that @xmath33 and @xmath34 are likewise zero , the remaining equations of motion are : @xmath35 these equations describe a flow from the unstable two - dimensional fixed point @xmath36 to the stable ( only in two dimensions ) fixed point @xmath37 .",
    "these flow equations are isomorphic to those of a one - dimensional particle in a constant field , with @xmath10 playing the rle of momentum and @xmath17 acting as the friction coefficient .",
    "patra and bhattacharya s assertion that the mkt equations are not ergodic relies on analyses in the vicinity of these two fixed points .",
    "that type of work is complicated by the fact that the four - dimensional flow becomes more and more intermittent as one nears either of these two points .",
    "nevertheless we believe that our analysis in this section and particularly in section vii below casts doubt on their claim ( hence our offering of the 2014 ian snook prize on that subject , as is described in section ix ) .",
    "choosing an initial condition somewhat closer to the origin @xmath38 gives @xmath39 projection plots which `` look '' spherical for the mkt and hh equations .",
    "the pb equations , on the other hand , provide a clearly - defined torus , shown in * figure 2 * .",
    "the pb dynamics has been projected into three - dimensional @xmath40 space .",
    "the pb projection shows that the phase - space distribution has at least one large cavity in the chaotic sea and that the cavity contains a family of nested tori .",
    "because a lack of ergodicity implies segregated regions in the @xmath41 space it is a tempting idea to study ensembles of initial conditions , expecting to find two or more distinct longtime - average values rather than a gaussian central - limit - theorem distribution around a single ergodic average value .",
    "in addition to moments , and their correlations , the largest lyapunov exponent should be a particularly `` good '' property to follow .",
    "although some complicated attractors ( such as rayleigh - bnard flows ) have more than a single chaotic strange - attractor region such a situation is implausible for the simple oscillator",
    ". therefore it seems likely that a random or a grid - based selection of initial points would produce at least a bimodal distribution of values for a nonergodic set of equations .",
    "some ensemble tests of this kind were carried out in references 6 and 13 .",
    "taking up the ensemble idea we choose 1000 different initial conditions in the four - dimensional hypercube of sidelength four centered on the origin , following each of them for @xmath42 timesteps .",
    "though there is no reason for the hh and mkt exponents to agree there turns out to be good agreement between them , as * figure 3 * shows . on the other hand the pb equations lyapunov exponents separate into two distinct values , 0.0000 and 0.14 , characteristic of their separate portions of the phase space .",
    "we view the density and lyapunov tests as the most convincing evidence that both the mkt and the hh algorithms _ are _ ergodic .",
    "to nail this conclusion down we took the two extreme cases ( the maximum and minimum lyapunov exponent out of 1000 simulations ) and ran them 1000 times longer .",
    "* figure 3 * shows the behavior of the ensemble of initial conditions for the martyna - klein - tuckerman and hoover - holian models .",
    "* figure 4 * shows a comparison of the maximum and minimum lyapunov - exponent calculations , carried out for a time 1000 times longer .",
    "the mkt and hh data show no significant difference between them , strongly suggesting that the entire set of random trajectories started in a @xmath43 hypercube are part of the same chaotic sea , filling all of space in a gaussian manner for the martyna - klein - tuckerman and hoover - holian oscillators .",
    "patra and bhattacharya also determined phase - space density numerically , in one- or two - dimensional cross sections@xcite .",
    "they also computed mean deviations of long - time - averaged distributions from the canonical one as averages .",
    "their final conclusion is that the martyna - klein - tuckerman algorithm is not ergodic .",
    "our own evidence for that same problem points in the opposite direction , toward ergodicity .",
    "we thank puneet patra , baidurya bhattacharya , and clint sprott for an exchange of hundreds of stimulating emails on this general subject , and specially appreciated a personal visit from professor bhattacharya this summer .",
    "the disagreement between our own investigations past and present ( which agree with those of martyna , klein , and tuckerman ) and those of patra and bhattacharya are both thought - provoking and stimulating .",
    "last year we offered a prize to honor the memory of our australian colleague ian snook .",
    "we asked arxiv readers for a time - reversed version of a simple pseudorandom number generator with a cycle length of @xmath44 . within 24 hours professor",
    "federico ricci - tersenghi ( university of rome ) won the prize with the elegant solution described in his arxiv.1305.1805 contribution@xcite , `` the solution to the challenge in ` time - reversible random number generators ' by wm .",
    "g. hoover and carol g. hoover '' .",
    "his generator can be used , for instance , to reverse brownian dynamics trajectories , a demonstration problem in our forthcoming book on the management and control of nonequilibrium systems .",
    "this year we invite the readers of computational methods in science and technology to consider thoughtfully this interesting problem in classical statistical mechanics and dynamical systems theory .",
    "specifically the ian snook prize for 2014 will be awarded to whomever submits the most convincing treatment of this problem to us prior to 1 january 2015 .",
    "the question to be discussed is `` to what extent are trajectory - based solutions of the martyna - klein - tuckerman harmonic - oscillator motion equations ergodic ? ''",
    "it is our intention to reward the most convincing entry received ( or submitted to the arxiv or to computational methods in science and technology ) prior to 1 january 2015 .",
    "the 2014 ian snook prize of five hundred united states dollars will be presented to the winner in january 2015 .",
    "we would be very grateful for your contributions .",
    "we dedicate this work to the memories of our two colleagues shown in * figure 5 * .",
    "we thank puneet patra and baidurya bhattacharya for bringing this problem to our attention and additionally thank clint sprott for his insights into a wide variety of fascinating problems in dynamical systems theory and for his thoughts on the current prize offer .",
