    "topological states of matter have become a focus of much theoretical and experimental effort ( see [ ] for detailed reviews , and [ ] for some of the earlier work on the subject ) .",
    "such an interest is dictated by a remarkable stability of topological phases and of their physical properties with respect to perturbation .",
    "topological insulators ( tis ) provide a simple example of such phases in a non - interacting system . from a band structure textbook perspective , these are ordinary band insulators with a spectral gap .",
    "however , in addition to the mere presence of the gap , the bands may have a non - trivial reciprocal - space topology , that manifests itself , _ inter alia _",
    ", by the presence of surface states , stable against moderate bulk and surface perturbations .",
    "this topology may be encapsulated in a special quantum number , assigned to the occupied bulk bands : insulators with an odd value of this number have protected gapless surface states within the bulk gap , and are called  topological \" . for an even value of this number , surface states within the bulk gap are not protected ; such insulators are called  topologically trivial \" .",
    "switching between an even and an odd value requires closing of the bulk gap and a phase transition ; otherwise , a smooth variation of the hamiltonian leaves this number intact .",
    "hence it is called a @xmath0 (  even - odd \" ) topological invariant .",
    "symmetry tends to facilitate description , thus it is not surprising that some of the pioneering work on topological insulators studied rather symmetric systems : notably those symmetric with respect to both the time reversal @xmath1 and inversion @xmath2 .",
    "simultaneous presence of these two symmetries guarantees double degeneracy of bulk bloch eigenstates at any momentum in the brillouin zone . for two - dimensional models ,",
    "one of the better - known examples of this kind is the so - called bernevig - hughes - zhang ( bhz ) model  @xcite , that we briefly review in this article .",
    "bulk bloch eigenstates may also be degenerate in systems with more delicate symmetries .",
    "a convenient example is provided by a collinear nel antiferromagnet , sketched in the fig .",
    "[ fig.lattice ] , where the time reversal symmetry @xmath1 is explicitly broken by magnetic order .",
    "black and white circles in the figure depict the two sublattices of a square - lattice nel antiferromagnet , and correspond to the opposite directions of local magnetization . both the time reversal @xmath1 and a translation @xmath3 by half a period @xmath4 invert the local magnetization ( interchange black and white circles in the fig .",
    "[ fig.lattice ] , and thus none of them is a symmetry of the system .",
    "however , the product @xmath5 remains a symmetry and conspires with inversion @xmath2 to ensure the double degeneracy of bloch eigenstates at any momentum in the brillouin zone  the same way as , in paramagnetic insulator , such a degeneracy appears due to a conspiracy of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .    with this similarity in mind , one may inquire whether an antiferromagnet may host a topologically non - trivial state of matter such as a topological insulator and , if so , whether the latter may have properties distinguishing it from its non - magnetic counterparts .",
    "several pioneering studies have already addressed this issue .",
    "in particular , mong _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have posed the question of whether an antiferromagnetic insulator may be topologically non - trivial , and whether or not it may be characterized by a topological invariant .",
    "the authors concluded that , in contrast to non - magnetic insulators , the presence of surface states in an antiferromagnet is sensitive to whether the surface is symmetric under the same combination of a translation and time reversal as the bulk .",
    "this result was obtained for three - dimensional materials and was confirmed for a special choice of boundary .",
    "the investigation of three - dimensional antiferromagnetic topological insulators has , since then , become an extensive subject of study .",
    "@xcite    in a subsequent publication , fang _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite studied a class of systems that , beyond symmetries involving time reversal , also possess an inversion center .",
    "they argued that antiferromagnetic insulators with such properties may be characterized by a @xmath0 topological invariant that , similarly to a paramagnet , involves the product of parity eigenvalues over a set of special points in the brillouin zone .",
    "however , in an antiferromagnet this set of special points would comprise only a half of the points that are relevant in the paramagnetic case .",
    "the systems mentioned above can be viewed as a particular example of the so - called crystalline topological insulators , which have been studied in 3 dimensions @xcite and also in the case of the two - dimensional honeycomb lattice @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient of all these studies is the presence of time reversal symmetry supplemented by a crystal symmetry .    here",
    ", we study the precise form of this @xmath0 invariant in an antiferromagnetic insulator for a particular generalization of the bhz model  @xcite in two dimensions . in the sec.[sec.bhz ] we briefly review the bhz model and its symmetries .",
    "we then extend the model by turning on staggered magnetization , identify its symmetries and ask whether its topology may be characterized similarly to how it is done for the paramagnetic bhz model . in the sec.[sec.methods ] , we review some of the methods used to study topological insulators : the fu - kane topological invariant  @xcite , the parallel transport method  @xcite , the method of wannier charge centers  @xcite  and , finally , an explicit construction of edge states . we show that these methods do not apply to an antiferromagnet verbatim , and show how they must be adapted .",
    "the model we consider is centrosymmetric , hence we test our results against the @xmath0 topological invariant in the form proposed by fang _",
    "et al . _ , and find perfect agreement . however , our adaptation of the wannier charge center method applies perfectly well even when the parity - based criterion no longer does . to illustrate this , in the sec .",
    "( [ sec.p_broken ] ) we consider a non - centrosymmetric perturbation of the initial hamiltonian : the method successfully identifies the topological phases .",
    "finally , the sec . [ sec.cdo ] contains concluding remarks and an outlook .",
    "bernevig , hughes and zhang proposed a model to describe topological insulating phases in hgte / cdte quantum wells .",
    "@xcite in this section , we first present the hamiltonian they introduced .",
    "we then see how it is modified in the presence of antiferromagnetism , and study how magnetic order affects its topological properties .",
    "we consider a square lattice , defined by lattice vectors @xmath6 , with @xmath7 ( see the fig . [ fig.lattice ] ) . a unit cell labelled by @xmath8 hosts four single - electron states , @xmath9 : two @xmath10-type orbitals , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and two @xmath13-type orbitals , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "we will use the index @xmath16 to denote the @xmath10-state ( @xmath17 ) or a @xmath13-state ( @xmath18 ) , and @xmath19 for the spin . in this basis ,",
    "the bhz hamiltonian may be written as :     and @xmath20 . in the presence of staggered magnetization",
    ", the dimerized lattice is defined by the primitive vectors @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in this case ,",
    "a unit cell ( in blue ) comprises two sites , a and b ( white and black dots , respectively ) .",
    "the center of a unit cell ( denoted @xmath23 in the main text ) is represented by a cross . ]",
    "@xmath24    the first term ( @xmath25 ) originates from the energy difference of the the s- and p - symmetric orbitals .",
    "the second term corresponds to the nearest - neighbor hopping between the same orbitals , with different hopping amplitudes , @xmath26 . finally , the remaining two terms hybridize the two species via the amplitude @xmath27 , and are of spin - orbital nature .",
    "the hamiltonian is non - interacting , and its ground state is built by filling the single - electron states up to the fermi energy . at half - filling , the bulk spectrum has an insulating gap .",
    "however , depending on the hamiltonian parameters , the system may be a trivial or a topological insulator , in the sense described in the introduction  as we argue below .",
    "it turns out that the trivial phase is realized for @xmath28 : a boundary of such a system hosts an even number of pairs of edge states .",
    "by contrast , when @xmath29 , the system is in a topological phase , and has an odd number of pairs of states at the boundary .",
    "thus , in the topological phase , at least a single pair of chiral edge states is guaranteed to exist .",
    "transition from a topological to the trivial state implies closing the band gap ( here , this occurs at @xmath30 ) and is a quantum phase transition .",
    "hence the term  topologically protected edge states \" .",
    "topology of either of the phases can be characterized by the parity of the number of pairs of edge states , which , as we will see below , is related to the @xmath0 topological invariant .",
    "it is interesting to note that the strength @xmath27 of the spin - orbit coupling does not appear in the above inequalities despite being responsible for the existence of the insulating gap .",
    "translational invariance of the crystal lattice allows one to define the bloch hamiltonian @xmath31 and obtain @xmath32 where the @xmath33 and @xmath34 , with @xmath35 and @xmath36 standing for @xmath37 and @xmath38 , are the pauli matrices acting in the spin and orbital spaces , respectively .",
    "the identity operator in either of the two spaces is omitted for brevity : for example , the last term in the eq.([eq.bhz k space ] ) acts as the identity operator in the spin space .    the bhz hamiltonian is invariant under the time reversal @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is complex conjugation .",
    "the operator @xmath41 is anti - unitary , and @xmath42 .    using the kramers theorem arguments",
    ", one can show that the eigenstates of the bhz hamiltonian come in kramers pairs ( see appendix [ app.degeneracy ] for a general proof ) , a state at momentum @xmath43 being related to its degenerate counterpart at momentum @xmath44 .",
    "this has an important consequence for a set of special points @xmath45 in the brillouin zone , called time reversal invariant momenta ( trim ) .",
    "these special points satisfy the equality @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is a reciprocal lattice vector , and @xmath48 take values @xmath49 or @xmath50 . as @xmath51 is equivalent to @xmath52 , the trim states are doubly degenerate , an important property that we will use later .",
    "the hamiltonian is also invariant under inversion @xmath53 ( the @xmath54 comes from the fact that the s - orbital remains invariant under inversion , while the p - orbital acquires a minus sign ) . note that @xmath55 and @xmath56 .    combining the @xmath41 and @xmath57",
    ", one can show that each bloch eigenstate also has a degenerate partner at the same momentum .      looking to study the effect of anti - ferromagnetism on topological insulators , we introduce a staggered magnetization , following the refs .",
    "[ ] , via the term : @xmath58 where the @xmath59 is the product of the antiferromagnetic ordered moment and the constant that couples it to the conduction electron spin . the eq.([eq.term mag ] ) introduces antiferromagnetic order phenomenologically , independently of the precise form of the interaction that gives rise to magnetism .",
    "at the same time , it entirely neglects both thermal and quantum fluctuations of the magnetic order .",
    "this may be justified for the ordered moment that is noticeable on the scale of the bohr magneton , and at temperatures well below the nel temperature .",
    "staggered magnetization in the eq.([eq.term mag ] ) doubles the unit cell of the paramagnetic state and reduces its translation symmetry .",
    "the new bravais lattice is now defined by the vectors @xmath60 , and contains two sites per unit cell , a and b , positioned at @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively ( see the fig . [ fig.lattice ] ) .",

    "however , their product @xmath73 ( @xmath74 being the translation by a vector @xmath75 ) remains a symmetry .",
    "the @xmath76 is also anti - unitary but does not square to @xmath77 for an arbitrary momentum in the brillouin zone . indeed , as the time reversal operator commutes with any purely spatial transformation , it commutes with any translation , and thus @xmath78 .",

    "they have no horizontal counterparts since the chosen @xmath76 involves translation only along the @xmath84-axis .",

    "however , the system is still invariant under the inversion symmetry , represented by the operator @xmath87 , whose expression is given in the appendix [ app.degeneracy ] .",
    "thanks to both symmetries , one may show that it is still possible to separate the states in kramers - like pairs relating a state of momentum @xmath43 to a state of momentum @xmath44 ( see appendix [ app.degeneracy ] ) .",
    "this will prove indispensable in the next section , when computing the @xmath0 invariant in the antiferromagnetic case .",
    "moreover , one may show that the combined symmetry @xmath88 is anti - unitary and squares to @xmath77 .",
    "thus , each bloch eigenstate possesses an orthogonal degenerate partner at the same momentum , and the bulk bands are doubly degenerate .",
    "@xcite    as before , the system has a insulating gap at half - filling , and two questions arise :    * does a topological phase survive for a finite value of the staggered magnetization ? *",
    "starting from a trivial phase with @xmath89 , can we obtain a topological phase by switching on a staggered magnetization ?",
    "fang and collaborators  @xcite proposed an expression for the @xmath0 invariant for a two - dimensional nel antiferromagnet , symmetric under both the @xmath76 and @xmath87 .",
    "we will discuss this criterion in more detail in the next section ( see the eq.([eq.def inv topo with xi af ] ) ) .",
    "applied to the case at hand , the criterion due to fang _",
    "_ as expressed by the eq .",
    "( [ eq.def inv topo with xi af ] ) suggests the positive answer to both questions .",
    "indeed , e.g. for @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , we obtain the phase diagram in the fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] , where the filled region corresponds to values of @xmath59 and @xmath93 where we have a topological insulator ( all of the numerical results presented in this article will assume those values for @xmath94 and @xmath95 ) .",
    "the phase diagram shows that , starting in the topological phase at @xmath89 and upon increasing @xmath59 , the system remains non - trivial until @xmath96 . on the other hand ,",
    "if one starts in a trivial phase at @xmath89 , there is a range of @xmath59 , where the system becomes topologically non - trivial , corresponding to regions where @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "we verified this by applying the method detailed in the next section to several sets of parameters .",
    "the results were in perfect agreement with the prediction of fang and collaborators .",
    "because of the staggered magnetization , we are now working with a 8-band model , and once again , the symmetries protect doubly - degenerate bands .",
    "thus , it is now possible to open insulating gaps at @xmath99 and @xmath100 filling , that have no equivalent in the bhz model .",
    "it is also interesting to see if we may have topological phases at such fillings . using the expression ( [ eq.def inv topo with xi af ] ) due to fang _",
    "et al . _ for the @xmath0 invariant , we obtain the phase diagram in the fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] , which is once again in perfect agreement with our numerical results .",
    "in this section we discuss some of the techniques used to characterize time reversal - symmetric topological insulators , using , as an illustration , the bhz hamiltonian with and without staggered magnetization .    the first method , due to fu and kane  @xcite yields an expression for the @xmath0 invariant that can be computed analytically , knowing continuously defined bloch functions in the bulk .",
    "the second method is an adaptation of the fu - kane approach to cases where the bloch states may be computed only numerically , by studying either the phase variation of bloch functions across the brillouin zone  @xcite , or the so - called wannier charge center trajectories  @xcite . finally ,",
    "the third method amounts to an explicit construction of edge states , as the number of edge states may distinguish between the trivial and the topological phase .",
    "we first present the main steps in the derivation of the @xmath0 topological invariant due to fu and kane , and then the modifications necessary to account for the presence of staggered magnetization .",
    "the technical details are given in the appendices [ app.fu and kane ] and [ app.fu and kane af ] .",
    "as the bhz hamiltonian enjoys translational invariance , its eigenstates can be written as : @xmath101 with @xmath102 from 1 to 4 for bhz , and with @xmath103 being the eigenvectors of the bloch hamiltonian of the eq.([eq.bhz k space ] ) .",
    "we choose the @xmath80 to be continuous over the bz .",
    "as stated previously , the bhz hamiltonian is time reversal - invariant , so the eigenstates of the bhz hamiltonian come in kramers pairs .",
    "we can thus separate the eigenstates in @xmath104 , in such a way that @xmath105 the value of the topological invariant will depend on how the phase @xmath106 varies across the bz .",
    "the topological invariant is defined via the time reversal polarization @xmath107 , introduced by fu and kane  @xcite in terms of the center of mass position along @xmath108 of hybrid wannier functions , computed at a fixed @xmath109 .",

    "it turns out that the eq.([eq.def inv topo with sew ] ) admits the form  @xcite @xmath114 where @xmath115 are the parity eigenvalues of the filled eigenstates @xmath116 .",
    "contrary to the eq.([eq.def inv topo with sew ] ) , the expression in the r.h.s of the eq.([eq.def inv topo with xi ] ) has the advantage of relying only on the knowledge of the states at the trim .",
    "indeed , @xmath117 is gauge - invariant , so one can compute the @xmath118 separately for the different trim , without insisting on a continuous definition of the states across the bz .",
    "however , such an expression can be obtained only for a centrosymmetric system .    in the af case , we doubled the number of bands in the bloch hamiltonian ",
    "and thus the index @xmath102 , that was defined in the eq.([eq.lien psi et u ] ) and took values from 1 to 4 , now varies from 1 to 8 . as mentioned above , due to the breaking of the time - reversal symmetry",
    ", we are no longer guaranteed kramers degeneracy all over the bz .",
    "indeed , there is a line @xmath119 of states in the bz , where @xmath85 and , strictly speaking , the kramers theorem does not hold .",

    "however , in an antiferromagnet this expression can not be reduced to a simple form as in the eq.([eq.def inv topo with sew ] ) : indeed , the sewing matrix @xmath124 is no longer anti - symmetric at all the trim .",

    "[ fig.bz ] , the pfaffian in the eq.([eq.def inv topo with sew ] ) can not even be defined .",
    "however , the topological invariant @xmath125 of the eq.([eq.def inv topo with p ] ) may be recast in a form that , albeit less elegant , remains valid in the case of the af order , for a continuous gauge and under the convenient choice of axes @xmath126 and @xmath127 described in the appendix [ app.fu and kane af ] : @xmath128 { \\nonumber}\\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{\\pi } \\sum_\\alpha ( \\chi_{\\alpha,0,\\gamma_b}+ \\chi_{\\alpha,\\pi,\\gamma_b})\\bigg]\\mathrm{mod}~2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this expression has the advantage of depending only on @xmath106 , and of being computable given a continuous set of bloch states .",

    "it corroborates the importance of the time reversal polarization of the eq.([eq.def inv topo with xi af ] ) also in the present case .",
