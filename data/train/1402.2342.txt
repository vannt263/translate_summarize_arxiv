    "the driving mechanism for the transition between the l dwarf and t dwarf spectral classes has emerged as one of the outstanding problems in brown dwarf astrophysics .",
    "spectroscopically , this transition is defined by the appearance of ch@xmath4 absorption features at near - infrared wavelengths @xcite , accompanied by a substantial reduction of condensate cloud opacity @xcite .",
    "both effects drive near - infrared spectral energy distributions ( seds ) to transition from red ( @xmath5 ) to blue ( @xmath6 ; @xcite ) , with strengthening molecular gas bands delineating the spectral subclasses .",
    "what is remarkable about the l dwarf / t dwarf transition is that it appears to take place over a relatively narrow range of effective temperatures ( t@xmath7s ) and luminosities , based on absolute magnitude trends ( e.g. , @xcite ) , broad - band sed measurements ( e.g. , @xcite ) and spectral model fits ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the l / t transition also exhibits an apparent excess of binaries @xcite , gaps in color distributions @xcite and a decline in number densities as a function of spectral type @xcite , trends that suggest the transition is rapid in time as well as temperature .",
    "the important role of photospheric cloud evolution for this transition is seen in the observation that early - type t dwarfs with minimal cloud opacity are often significantly brighter at 1  @xmath1 than their hotter , cloudier l dwarf counterparts .",
    "this is true in both color - magnitude diagrams of local populations @xcite and among components of `` flux - reversal '' binaries that straddle the l / t transition @xcite .",
    "the 1  @xmath1 region is a minimum of molecular gas opacity  the local pseudocontinuum ",
    "so condensate grain scattering can dominate the overall opacity at these wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the 1  @xmath1 brightening has thus been interpreted as a depletion of photospheric condensate clouds over a narrow range of t@xmath7 and/or time .",
    "the geometry of the depletion has been modeled as both global changes in photospheric chemistry ( e.g. , @xcite ) and hole formation that allows light to emerge from hotter regions @xcite .",
    "the latter hypothesis predicts an enhancement of rotationally - modulated photometric variability at the l / t transition , particularly in the 1  @xmath1 region , depending on the sizes and distribution of the cloud gaps .",
    "recent brown dwarf monitoring observations support this prediction , as the two most prominent variables identified to date , simp  j013656.5 + 093347 ( @xcite ; hereafter simp  j0136 + 0933 ) and 2mass j21392676 + 0220226 ( @xcite ; hereafter 2mass  j2139 + 0220 ) are both early - type t dwarfs .",
    "their variability can be reproduced with spot models assuming regions with thick and thin clouds at different temperatures assumed to probe different layers in the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the spectral character of the observed variability is nevertheless complex . rather than variability being limited to pseudocontinuum regions where gas opacity is a minimum",
    ", broad - band chromatic and achromatic variations are seen across the infrared @xcite .",
    "the light curve shapes themselves are also seen to change over several rotation periods , suggesting dynamic evolution of features at rates considerably faster than the solar gas giants @xcite . finally , variability measurements over widely - separated spectral regions have recently revealed evidence of pressure - dependent phase variations , indicating vertical structure in the features driving the variability @xcite .",
    "the considerable level of detail on brown dwarf cloud structure and atmospheric dynamics garnered from these monitoring studies is of relevance to exoplanet atmospheres , where clouds are now seen as a key opacity source .",
    "the recently - discovered , nearby binary brown dwarf system wise  j104915.57@xmath0531906.1ab ( hereafter luhman  16ab ; @xcite ) has emerged as a potential benchmark for studying the l / t transition . with spectral types of l7.5 and t0.5 @xcite ,",
    "its components straddle the transition .",
    "its t dwarf secondary is brighter than the primary in the 0.951.3  @xmath1 range , making it a flux - reversal system @xcite .",
    "luhman  16ab is also a significant variable .",
    "combined - light red optical photometry by revealed peak - to - peak variability of @xmath810% with a period of 4.87@xmath90.01  hr , with large changes in the light curve structure over daily timescales .",
    "the variability was attributed primarily to the t dwarf component .",
    "resolved photometry by @xcite extended the observed variability into the near - infrared , confirmed luhman  16b as the dominant variable , and revealed pressure - dependent phase variations .",
    "as such , this system embodies nearly all of the remarkable characteristics of the l / t transition  multiplicity , variability , and flux reversal  while residing only 2.020@xmath90.019  pc from the sun @xcite .    in april 2013 ,",
    "our consortium organized a week - long monitoring campaign of luhman  16ab using telescopes in chile , australia and hawaii , with the aim of characterizing its variability panchromatically ( radio , optical and infrared ) and spectroscopically , while simultaneously obtaining kinematic data ( radial and rotational velocities ) to constrain its orbit and viewing geometry .",
    "this article reports low - resolution near - infrared spectroscopic monitoring observations obtained over 45 minutes with the spex spectrometer @xcite on the 3.0 m nasa infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) , coincident with combined - light optical photometry obtained with the transiting planets and planetesimals small telescope ( trappist ; @xcite ) . in section  2",

    "luhman  16ab was observed with irtf / spex on 26 april 2013 ( ut ) in clear and dry conditions with variable seeing .",
    "we used the 0@xmath105 slit and prism - dispersed mode to obtain @xmath11 @xmath2 120 spectra covering 0.72.5  @xmath1 .",
    "the source was monitored for just over an hour , between ut times 06:05 and 07:10 , while seeing ranged from 0@xmath108 to @xmath122@xmath13 .",
    "the slit was aligned along the binary axis at a position angle of 313@xmath14 ( east of north ) to obtain simultaneous spectroscopy ; note that this differed significantly from the parallactic angle of luhman  16ab , which varied from 12@xmath14 through 0@xmath14 and back to 4@xmath14 during the sequence .",
    "we obtained 70 exposures of 30  s each in an abba dither pattern .",

    "the choice of a narrow slit was driven by guiding considerations , which was done on spill - over light from the primary using the @xmath15+@xmath16 notch filter . with a transmission notch at 1.8  @xmath1 to block out the telluric h@xmath17o absorption band",

    "ar arc lamp exposures were obtained for pixel response and wavelength calibration .",
    "we performed an initial extraction of the combined - light spectrum as described in @xcite , using spextool @xcite with standard settings but a wide spatial aperture that encompassed both sources .",
    "this coarse extraction provided the wavelength calibration , telluric correction and relative flux calibration files necessary for subsequent component extractions .",

    "detailed extraction of the component spectra are described below .      throughout the overall campaign ,",
    "luhman  16ab was monitored with trappist , a 0.6  m robotic telescope located at la silla observatory in chile .",

    "luhman  16ab was observed for roughly 7.5  hr on 26 april 2013 ( ut ) .",
    "data were reduced as described in . after a standard pre - reduction ( bias , dark , flatfield correction ) , aperture photometry was performed using iraf / daophot2 @xcite with an aperture radius of 8 pixels ( 5@xmath102 ) that encompassed both sources .",
    "differential photometry was determined by comparison to a grid of non - varying background stars , and the resulting light curve normalized .",
    "that light curve is shown in figure  [ fig : trappist ] .",
    "as in the original detection , luhman  16ab exhibits significant variability over the observing period with a peak - to - peak amplitude of 5% in a roughly sinusoidal pattern . to determine the variability period , we used the phase dispersion minimization technique @xcite , cycling through 500 periods linearly spaced between 7.0  min ( 5 times the minimum sampling ) and 7.1  hr ( 80% of the full observational period ) . for each period , we phase - folded the light - curve , computed a mean curve sampled at 50 phase points across the period , then computed the @xmath23 deviation of the phased data from the mean curve .",
    "we performed the same analysis with the data randomly shuffled 100 times to compute a baseline deviation ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : trappist ] shows that ratio of these deviations as a function of period , @xmath25 , which exhibits a broad minimum at each period by varying the photometric data about the measurement uncertainties 100 times .",

    "the phased lightcurve repeats over the 1.5 periods observed , consistent with rotationally - modulated surface structure .",
    "given the seeing conditions during our spex observations , the component spectra are blended to varying degrees at all wavelengths . in order to robustly separate the spectra , we directly modeled the individual data frames .",
    "we first pairwise - subtracted the raw frames , dividing each by the median - combined flat - field frame generated by spextool , and then excised 48-pixel ( 7@xmath102 ) regions from each image along the spatial direction that encompassed both component spectral traces . for these subimages",
    ", we performed a column - by - column fit of the spatial profiles with a six - component gaussian model : a central gaussian and two satellites for each component , with the satellites constrained to have the same separations and relative peaks for both components .",
    "all gaussians were forced to have the same widths to reduce parameter degeneracies , and each three - gaussian component profile was allowed to vary independently in amplitude and position . including a constant background value",
    ", this 10-parameter model was initialized by fitting to an integrated profile ( summing all columns corresponding to wavelengths 1.01.3  @xmath1 , 1.551.75  @xmath1 and 2.052.3  @xmath1 ) and then fitting each column individually starting from the integrated profile parameters .",
    "the fits were converged using an implementation of the nelder - mead simplex algorithm ( amoeba ; @xcite ) to minimize the reduced chi - square statistic , @xmath28 between the spatial profile @xmath29 and model @xmath30 , scaled by the image variance @xmath31 .",
    "a masking vector @xmath32 was determined by repeating the fit three times and excluding highly deviant pixels ( @xmath123@xmath27 ) , resulting in @xmath33 unmasked pixels in a given column .",
    "component fluxes at each image column were integrated directly from the final profile model , and flux uncertainties ( @xmath34 ) were determined as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the effective number of pixels used to determine the flux based on the model , and @xmath37 is the standard deviation between model and image counts for unmasked pixels in the spatial profile .",
    "this combination is multiplied by @xmath38 to account for systematic deviations in the profile model .",
    "figures  [ fig : model_image ] and  [ fig : model_profile ] illustrate the quality of these fits , comparing the observed and modeled profiles as well as data and model images . when the observed seeing was below 1@xmath102 ( which encompassed 49 images in the period 6:036:46 ut ) , the profile fits converged exceptionally well , with fit residuals and corresponding spectral uncertainties typically 0.5 - 1% in the brightest spectral regions .",
    "the modeling was also generally resistant to bad pixels , with the exception of a spectral detector crack visible in the 2.362.40  @xmath1 region in figure  [ fig : model_image ] .",
    "visually apparent even in the raw data , our observations confirm the flux reversal between luhman  16a and b reported by @xcite . as shown in figure",
    "[ fig : model_profile ] , the t dwarf component is on average 20% brighter at @xmath39 and @xmath40 and 20% fainter at @xmath16 compared to the l dwarf component . figure  [ fig : variability ] displays these differences across the full spectral range , showing that luhman  16b is the brighter component from 0.95 - 1.33  @xmath1 , and marginally brighter even from 1.551.65  @xmath1 . again , these are the spectral regions that are most influenced by condensate grain scattering and absorption in the l dwarfs , indicating that cloud opacity plays a primary role in the observed flux reversal .",
    "the observed fluxes are affected by three systematic effects : ( 1 ) slit losses due to the finite slit width used , which will vary with seeing and telescope tracking ; ( 2 ) changes in atmospheric transmission due to the changing airmass over the observation ; and ( 3 ) differential color refraction ( dcr ) induced by observing the pair aligned along their binary axis rather than the parallactic angle .",
    "the last two factors are particularly problematic for this observation given the large airmass at which luhman  16ab was observed . rather than devise a model to compensate for these effects , potentially introducing new systematic errors",
    ", we focused our analysis on relative flux variations over narrow spectral bands .",
    "this choice mitigates slit loss and transmission variations which affect both sources equally , and we assume that dcr does not induce significant color variation over a sufficiently narrow wavelength range . off the horizon ) , we can not implicitly assume dcr effects are negligible in the near - infrared ; see @xcite . ]",
    "we quantified variability by measuring the relative observed fluxes of the two components , @xmath41 , in 0.03  @xmath1 bands ( @xmath223 resolution elements ) between 0.92.3  @xmath1 ( figure  [ fig : variability ] ) .",
    "we used the @xmath23 statistic to assess the presence of variability for each spectral band over the observing period : @xmath42 here , @xmath43 = 49 , @xmath44 is the uncertainty in relative flux at time @xmath45 ( typically 13% ) and @xmath46 is the modeled value .",
    "we considered the two simplest models of constant flux ( @xmath46 = @xmath47 ) and linear variation with time ( @xmath48 = @xmath47 + @xmath49 t ) , and found that the latter was a statistically significant better fit to the timeseries data in the pseudocontinuum regions based on the f - test statistic ( confidence of 95% or greater ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : variability ] displays the linear slopes in percentage change per hour as a function of wavelength .",
    "nearly all of the regions for which time variability is statistically significant are those in which luhman  16b is the brighter component and , assuming identical radii , has a higher brightness temperature values , we first determined the scaling term for luhman  16a that converts its apparent spectral flux to surface flux based on its measured absolute @xmath40-band magnitude of 15.00@xmath90.04 @xcite and a radius of 0.86@xmath90.06  r@xmath50 using the evolutionary models of @xcite and assuming t@xmath7 @xmath2 13001500  k and an age of 1 - 5  gyr .",
    "we applied the same scaling to luhman  16b .",
    "brightness temperatures were assigned by determining the planck blackbody that provides an equivalent flux density .",
    "the absolute brightness temperature values have uncertainties of 4% based on uncertainties in the absolute magnitudes and radii of the sources , but relative temperature differences between the two components are certain to better than 0.5% . ] ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "this result is consistent with the results of and @xcite , who find that luhman  16b dominates the observed variability of the system .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath49 decreases with increasing wavelength , from 10%  hr@xmath3 at 1  @xmath1 to 4%  hr@xmath3 at 2.1  @xmath1 .",
    "this is qualitatively similar to broad - band photometric variations of sips  j0136 + 0933 @xcite and 2mass  j2139 + 0220 @xcite , which are observed to be greater at @xmath40 than @xmath16 . on the other hand ,",
    "the sense of this variation is also consistent with the declining brightness of luhman  16b relative to the seemingly invariable luhman  16a @xcite .",
    "we also note small declines in @xmath49 in regions of strong h@xmath17o absorption ( 1.351.45  @xmath1 , 1.82.0  @xmath1 ) , although signals - to - noise in these regions are much lower .",
    "we show the time series of the relative fluxes in significantly variable bands and in broader spectral regions ( 0.1  @xmath1 ) encompassing the @xmath39 ( 1.121.22  @xmath1 ) , @xmath40 ( 1.251.35  @xmath1 ) , @xmath15 ( 1.61.7  @xmath1 ) , and @xmath16 ( 2.12.2  @xmath1 ) flux peaks in figure  [ fig : variability ] .",
    "remarkably , all of these regions show a common morphology : a fast ( @xmath83  min ) dimming of order 5% at ut 6:08 , followed by a much slower decline for the remainder of the observing period .",
    "the fast dimming does not appear to be related to sudden changes in seeing or airmass ; indeed , a step - up in seeing at 6:24 ut does not coincide with any feature in the light curves .",
    "we verified that the decline beyond 6:08 remained significant for three regions in the @xmath40-band ( 1.095  @xmath1 , 1.125  @xmath1 and 1.215  @xmath1 ) where luhman  16b is brightest , with a linear declining trend of 56%  hr@xmath3 .",
    "examining the broad - band spectral peak relative fluxes , we again see a wavelength dependence during the slow decline , with @xmath52 changing the most at @xmath39 and @xmath40 bands and the least at @xmath16 .",
    "overall , it appears that the relative fluxes of these two components underwent a sharp then gradual decrease over the observing period , amounting to a @xmath27.5% ( @xmath25% ) decline in brightness at @xmath40 ( @xmath16 ) over 45  min .",
    "note that our limited time coverage prevents assessment of the @xmath8100@xmath14 phase difference between @xmath40 and @xmath16 variations reported by @xcite .",
    "the decline in relative spectral fluxes aligns well with a decline in combined red optical light as measured by trappist ( hatched region in figure  [ fig : trappist ] ) .",
    "the spectral monitoring period coincided with a 2.5% decrease in total brightness , or a 4%  hr@xmath3 linear trend with time , shallower than our near - infrared spectral band measurements .",
    "since a decline in relative flux must be caused by a dimming secondary and/or brightening primary , and a decline in total flux by a dimming secondary and/or dimming primary , we logically conclude from both of these datasets that luhman  16b is the variable component , in agreement with and @xcite .",
    "if luhman  16b is the primary variable in this system , the wavelength dependence of the observed spectral variations , particularly in the pseudocontinuum regions where they are significant , arises from three possible effects .",
    "first , achromatic changes in the pseudocontinuum caused by pulsation and/or achromatic opacity variations , that manifest as a wavelength - dependent variation due to the changing relative fluxes of the two components across the near - infrared ; second , chromatic variations arising from changes in intrinsically wavelength - dependent opacities ; and third , a combination of both . to assess the underlying nature of luhman  16b s variability",
    ", we used a simple empirical model to replicate both spex and trappist observations during the monitoring period . assuming luhman  16a was invariable in the near - infrared during the time of our observations ( @xmath530.3% variability was reported by @xcite in 4  hr of observation ) , and that the variability of luhman  16b is linear ( or nearly so ) in time and/or wavelength over the period observed , the simplest model for the spectrum of luhman  16b taking into account these effects is : @xmath54 .",
    "\\label{eqn : varmodel}\\ ] ] here , @xmath55 is the median spectrum of luhman  16b over the monitoring period , @xmath56 is the start of the period , @xmath57 = 1.77  @xmath1 is the median wavelength of the spectrum , and the parameters @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are linear coefficients taking into account relative scaling , achromatic time variation , chromatic scaling and chromatic time variation , respectively . assuming @xmath62 , we used this function to calculate the linear rate of change of the relative spectra ( @xmath49 ) , as well as the combined light of the system integrated over a constant 0.751.1  @xmath1 passband to simulate the trappist data .",
    "applying the nelder - mead algorithm with a @xmath23 evaluation , we determined the best parameters for equation  [ eqn : varmodel ] fitting only for @xmath49 .",
    "we also performed fits in which one or more parameters were forced to be zero to assess their significance .",
    "the best - fit model , shown in figure  [ fig : variability ] , required all terms except @xmath60 , with @xmath58 = 1.39 , @xmath59 = @xmath00.0549  hr@xmath3 and @xmath61 = 0.0468  hr@xmath3  @xmath63 .",
    "fitting with @xmath60 gave similar values for the other parameters but made the overall fit slightly worse .",
    "excluding either the achromatic ( @xmath59 ) or chromatic ( @xmath61 ) variation terms , or both , produced significantly worse fits which could be excluded at @xmath1295% confidence based on the f - test statistic .",
    "we may therefore conclude that both achromatic and chromatic pseudocontinuum variations were present in luhman  16b during the monitoring period , variations that are consistent with changes in the cloud covering fraction @xcite .",
    "the positive value of @xmath61 is particularly relevant here , as it indicates that the variable opacity source plays a greater role at shorter wavelengths where gas opacity is minimal , as expected if that source is condensate grain opacity .",
    "the predicted trappist light curve for the model constrained by the spex spectra also agrees well with that data ( figure  [ fig : variability ] ) .",
    "in particular , the model produces a smaller amplitude of optical variation due to the reduced contribution of luhman  16b to the combined light of the system at these wavelengths .",
    "spectral trends in variability have been examined in several l and t dwarfs to date , through pure spectroscopy ( e.g. , ) and simultaneous or near - simultaneous broad - band imaging ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the most significant variables up until now , simp  j0136 + 0933 and 2mass  j2139@xmath00220 , both exhibit color trends in near - infrared photometric variability , with larger amplitude changes at @xmath40 as compared to @xmath16 , again consistent with variable condensate cloud opacity .",
    "however , spectroscopic variability measurements of these same two sources over 1.01.7  @xmath1 by @xcite indicate that achromatic or near - achromatic variations dominate the psuedocontinuum . these authors propose a two - layer cloud model with a thick shallow cloud and thin deep cloud as a means of reproducing both achromatic psuedocontinuum and chromatic broadband variability .",
    "matched to atmosphere models , this framework can replicate observed trends in the colors and spectral shapes of simp  j0136 + 0933 and 2mass  j2139@xmath00220 over 1 - 3 rotation periods , although detailed fits to the data remain poor ( see also @xcite ) .    for luhman  16b , we also find that both achromatic and chromatic variations must be present in the psuedocontinuum to properly model the observations .",
    "achromatic variation yields a decline in the overall flux , amounting to roughly 0.03  mag in broad - band @xmath40 over the observing period .",
    "the concurrent chromatic variation simultaneously reddens the spectrum of this source by @xmath64 = 0.02  mag , resulting in a relative flux variation amplitude of @xmath65 = 0.41@xmath90.18 , similar to values reported for simp  j0136 + 0933 @xcite and 2mass  j2139@xmath00220 @xcite .",
    "combined , the achromatic and chromatic terms nearly cancel in the @xmath16-band , a region that is gas opacity dominated ( h@xmath17o , ch@xmath4 and h@xmath17 ) .",
    "hence , our linear spectral model is functionally consistent with condensate clouds being the primary driver of variability in luhman  16b .       given the known shortcomings in reproducing the near - infrared spectra of l / t transition brown dwarfs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we forgo detailed modeling of the spectra in lieu of a simply brightness temperature variation model , focusing at 1.25  @xmath1 where gas opacity is a minimum and cloud structure variations are expected to have the greatest influence @xcite . the simplest model for replicating the surface flux @xmath66 of a patchy brown dwarf is two sets of regions with differing brightness temperatures covering the surface : @xmath67 here , @xmath68 is the disk - averaged brightness temperature , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the brightness temperatures of cold and hot regions , respectively , @xmath71 is the areal covering fraction of the cold regions , and we ignore limb darkening .",
    "our interpretation of this model is that the cold regions correspond to the highest cloud layer in the brown dwarf atmosphere , while the hot regions correspond to gaps in these clouds that probe to some as - yet undetermined deeper layer with brightness temperature @xmath70 ; a cartoon perspective of this is shown in figure 6 of @xcite .",
    "we note that this is not the only interpretation of a two - spot model , which could also arise from magnetic interaction at the photosphere ( i.e. , starspots ) or updrafts of warm air pockets driven by convective flows .",
    "nevertheless , we will occasionally refer to the cold region as `` clouds '' and hot regions as `` holes '' in the following discussion .    for luhman  16b , @xmath72 = 1560  k at the 1.25  @xmath1 @xmath40-band peak continuum ( figure  [ fig : variability ]",
    "; see also @xcite ) . if we take the brightness temperature of luhman  16a at this wavelength , 1510  k , as an estimate for @xmath69 for both sources , region , where h@xmath17o and ch@xmath4 opacity play a larger role than clouds . ]",
    "then we can jointly constrain @xmath73 and @xmath70 , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : patchy ] .",
    "coverage of cold regions is essentially negligible for @xmath74 1570  k , then climbs to over 50% at @xmath75 1860  k. at hotter temperatures , our model predicts that the atmosphere of luhman  16b would be overall similar to that of luhman  16a with occasional hot spots , which we assume to be less than the evaporation temperature of mineral condensate species ( @xmath76 2000  k ; @xcite ) .",
    "we note that equal hot - cold spot coverage for luhman  16b occurs in the 17001900  k range that @xcite estimate as the effective top of a brown dwarf cloud layer ( @xmath77 ; see @xcite ) . @xcite and @xcite also provide estimates for @xmath73 and @xmath78 for simp  j0136 + 0933 and 2mass  j2139@xmath00220 based on their own two - spot modeling .",
    "while temperature values reported in these studies are based on model effective temperatures , if we assume that the brightness temperature offsets are the same as their preferred @xmath79 300  k , this would also place the hot regions of luhman  16b in the same temperature range as the cloud tops of the @xcite models .",
    "thus , if our spot model is interpreted as probing different layers of luhman  16b s atmosphere , the best estimates of the temperature differential is in line with the conjecture of @xcite that gaps in the highest cloud deck still probe regions influenced by condensate opacity .",

    "we therefore assume that the full 4.5% peak - to - peak variation in trappist photometry around our spectral observations ( figure  [ fig : trappist ] ) corresponds to a 13.5% variation at @xmath40 , or a peak - to - peak temperature fluctuation of @xmath86 50  k , exceeding those observed in 2mass  j2139@xmath00220 .",
    "however , we restrict our analysis here to the period around the spectral observations since the spectral response of larger fluctuations may differ . ] following eqn  [ eqn : da2 ] .",
    "this temperature offset is notably similar to the temperature difference between luhman  16a and b at these wavelengths ( figure  [ fig : variability ] ) . using the relationship between @xmath73 and @xmath70 above",
    ", we computed @xmath82 as a function of @xmath70 , also shown in figure  [ fig : patchy ] .",
    "not surprisingly , the areal variation required to reproduce the observed brightness variations declines with higher @xmath70 ; i.e. , with greater contrast between cold and hot regions .",
    "an important reference point is the temperature at which areal variations become smaller than the total cold region coverage , which occurs for @xmath87 1710  k and @xmath88 30% .",
    "the corresponding @xmath89 = 150  k is on the low end of estimates for simp  j0136 + 0933 and 2mass  j2139@xmath00220 , and just above the minimum @xmath77 from @xcite .    for the range 1700  k @xmath90 1900  k , which we again take as a reasonable estimates of the hot spot temperature ,",
    "the inferred cold covering fraction is roughly 3055% , intermediate between similar values inferred for simp  j0136 + 0933 ( 25 - 30% ) and 2mass  j2139@xmath00220 ( 50 - 65% ) by @xcite .      for 1700  k @xmath90 1900  k ,",
    "cold spot coverage must vary by 1530% over a single period to replicate the observed variability amplitude , implying a @xmath8 30 - 100% variation between hemispheres if the spot patterns are static .",
    "organized jet features in the atmospheres of the giant solar planets generally scale in size with the rhines length @xcite , @xmath91 , where @xmath92 the characteristic wind speed , @xmath93 is the radius , @xmath94 , @xmath29 is the rotation period and @xmath95 is the latitude of the feature .",
    "if we assume that the same scaling occurs for features in brown dwarf atmospheres ( e.g. , @xcite ) , then their maximum fractional size scale is : @xmath96 where we have assumed mid - latitude features . if we now relate this maximum scale to the areal spot variation inferred here ( @xmath97 ) , the known rotational period and assumed radius of luhman  16b implies characteristic wind speeds of 1.6  km  s@xmath3 @xmath98 3.4  km  s@xmath3 for 1700  k @xmath90 1900  k ( figure  [ fig : patchy ] ) .",
    "these speeds are somewhat higher than the range favored by the circulation models of @xcite , assuming winds are driven by inefficient conversion of convective heat ( 10300  m  s@xmath3 ) .",
    "however , the speeds do give advection timescales , @xmath99 rotation periods , that are consistent with the timescale of lightcurve evolution observed in luhman  16b .",
    "the convergence between the inferred variation and rhines length scales , and the advective and evolutionary time scales , suggest that our gross estimates for @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath73 and @xmath82 are not too far off the mark .",
    "however , we have made a number of major assumptions that require confirmation through more detailed spectroscopic monitoring and modeling , in particular to ascertain whether the spot regions have spectral characteristics ( features and line profile shapes ) consistent with the inferred brightness temperatures .",
    "nonetheless , our basic model of a cold cloud deck disrupted by warm dynamic features shows promising agreement with planetary analogs and current brown dwarf circulation models .",

    "] , its interpretation as an estimate of surface feature size is consistent with luhman  16b s intermediate period and intermediate variability amplitude , as a few large features are more likely to give rise to stronger disk - integrated variations than many small features @xcite .",

    "the source with the smallest cloud coverage , simp  j0136 + 0933 , is also the latest - type and presumably coldest brown dwarf in the sample .",
    "finally , we find essentially no difference in color variability among these sources . as noted above , our estimate of @xmath101 for luhman  16b is consistent with similar measures for simp  j0136 + 0933 and 2mass  j2139@xmath00220 ( although the latter can exhibit more extreme color terms ; @xcite ) , suggesting that the condensate clouds responsible for the variations in these sources are likely to have similar opacities and physical properties ( i.e. , composition , grain size distribution , vertical structure , etc . ) .",

    "we are able to successfully reproduce both the spex and trappist lightcurves with an empirical model that assumes luhman  16a is constant while luhman  16b undergoes both achromatic and chromatic pseudocontinuum flux variations .",
    "qualitatively , this model may be interpreted as arising from variations in cloud covering fraction in the photosphere of luhman  16b as it rotates , although other physical models ( starspots , gas upwelling ) may also apply . using a simple two - spot model that assumes cold regions are identical to the atmosphere of luhman  16a",
    ", we are able to deduce an average and variance in the cold ( or cloud ) covering fraction of luhman  16b as a function of the temperature of hot ( or hole ) regions .",
    "while the hot region temperature remains a free parameter , a range of 17001900  k is supported by the cloud models of @xcite and the temperature contrasts inferred for simp  j0136 + 0933 and 2mass  j2139@xmath00220 .",
    "this range is also supported by the supposition that surface features follow a rhines scale , and predict wind velocities of 13  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "these are higher than early expectations from brown dwarf circulation modeling , but consistent with advection timescales that align with lightcurve variability over a few rotation periods .",
    "rhines scale - sized features also explain the apparent trend between variability period and amplitude between simp  j0136 + 0933 , luhman  16b and 2mass  j2139@xmath00220 .",
    "the relative spectral fluxes of luhman  16a and b , the presence of significant near - infrared variability on luhman  16b , and the spectral nature of this variability all align with the model of cloud evolution through fragmentation as a driving mechanism for the l / t transition",
    ". however , other physical interpretations remain viable , and the influence of secondary parameters ( surface gravity , metallicity , viewing perspective ) are only starting to be explored @xcite . given its unique composition and proximity to the sun , the luhman  16ab system should continue to be monitored as a benchmark for cloud structure and evolution in cool brown dwarf and exoplanet atmospheres .",
