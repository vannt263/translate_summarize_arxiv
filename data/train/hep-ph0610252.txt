    "the perturbative approach to quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is believed to solve all problems within its own limitations provided the correct choices of the expansion variable and the variable(s ) to be fixed are used . however , perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) currently has the status of being a large collection of seemingly independent approaches , since a single unified approach valid for all processes is not known .",
    "this is problematic when one wants to use a range , qualitatively speaking , of different processes to constrain the same parameters , _",
    "e.g. _   in global fits .",
    "what is needed is a single formalism valid over the union of all ranges that the various pqcd approaches allow .",
    "this unification must be consistent , _",
    "i.e. _  it must agree with each approach in the set , when the expansion of that approach is used up to the order being considered .    in this presentation , we review recent progress in establishing a generalized formalism for the evolution of fragmentation functions ( ffs ) from the smallest @xmath0 values probed so far way up to unity @xcite . after explaining how to treat soft - gluon and hadron - mass effects in secs .

    "[ sec : four ] .",
    "our conclusions are contained in sec .",
    "[ sec : five ] .",
    "the current optimum description of single - hadron inclusive production is provided by the qcd parton model , which requires knowledge of the ffs @xmath1 , each corresponding at leading order ( lo ) to the probability for the parton @xmath2 produced at short distance @xmath3 to form a jet that includes the hadron @xmath4 carrying a fraction @xmath0 of the longitudinal momentum of @xmath2 . from now on we omit the label @xmath4 and put the ffs for all @xmath2 into the vector @xmath5 .",
    "the evolution of the ffs in the factorization scale @xmath6 is also required , which at large and intermediate @xmath0 is well described @xcite by the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) equation @xcite , given at lo by @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the lo splitting functions calculated from fixed - order ( fo ) pqcd .",

    "the color factors appearing in this presentation are @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ; @xmath17 is the number of active quark flavors .    on the other hand , at small @xmath0 , the fo approximation fails due to unresummed _ soft - gluon logarithms _ ( sgls ) .",
    "the most singular sgls are the _",

    "( [ dglapx ] ) becomes a poor approximation once @xmath23 .",

    ", the mlla leads to a good description of all data down to the smallest @xmath0 values .",
    "however , what has been lacking is a single approach which can describe data from the largest to the smallest @xmath0 values .",
    "such an approach can be simply and consistently constructed from the knowledge provided by the dla and the dglap equation .",
    "the result reproduces the fo result when expanded in @xmath29 , while all small-@xmath30 singularities are resummed into a non - singular expression in mellin space ( see later ) . as shown in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , this approach is unique up to higher - order terms in the fo series and up to less singular sgls , _",
    "e.g. _  the _ single logarithms _ ( sls ) .",
    "such a formalism may be constructed simply by evolving according to eq .",
    "( [ dglapx ] ) , but with the splitting function modified as @xmath31 where @xmath32 contains the complete resummed contribution to the splitting function to all orders from the dls , while @xmath33 is the remaining fo contribution at lo .",
    "it is obtained by subtracting the lo dls , already accounted for in @xmath34 , from @xmath19 to prevent double counting .",
    "we work to lo , since the less singular sgls that occur at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) are not known to all orders .",
    "however , we leave the sl at lo unresummed , since it is not singular as @xmath18 .",
    "we now use eq .",

    "equation  ( [ dlresummedinp ] ) contains all terms in the splitting function of the form @xmath41 , being the dls in mellin space , and agrees with the results of refs .",
    "we now return to @xmath0 space , where eq .",
    "( [ dlresummedinp ] ) reads @xmath42 with @xmath43 being the bessel function of the first kind .    to summarize our approach , we evolve the ffs according to eq .",

    "( [ alldlinzindelpclosed ] ) must be added to the nlo splitting functions .",
    "these contain sgls belonging to the classes @xmath46 , which must be subtracted .",
    "note that the nlo @xmath47 term is accounted for by the resummed dl contribution .",
    "the @xmath48 term is a type @xmath49 term , and hence does not need to be subtracted .    before we outline the phenomenological investigation of our approach , we note that it is more complete than the mlla , which can be shown as follows . with @xmath50",
    "accounted for , eq .",
    "( [ drappre ] ) is modified to @xmath51 , \\label{drap}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] up to terms which are being neglected in this presentation and which are neglected in the mlla .",
    "if we approximate @xmath52 by its sls , defined at lo to be the coefficients of @xmath53 , equal to those in @xmath54 , @xmath55 and apply the approximate result that follows from the dla at large @xmath56 , @xmath57 which can be derived , _",
    "e.g. _ , from eq .",
    "( [ alldlinzindelpclosed ] ) , the gluon component of eq .",
    "( [ drap ] ) becomes precisely the mlla differential equation .",
    "therefore , we conclude that , since we do not use these two approximations , our approach is more complete and accurate than the mlla .",
    "we now incorporate hadron mass effects into our calculations , using a specific choice of scaling variable . for this purpose ,",
    "it is helpful to work with light cone coordinates , in which any four - vector @xmath58 is written in the form @xmath59 with @xmath60 and @xmath61 . in the center - of - mass ( cm ) frame , the momentum of the electroweak boson takes the form @xmath62 in the absence of hadron mass , @xmath45 ( whose definition @xmath63 applies only in the cm frame ) is identical to the light cone scaling variable @xmath64",
    ". however , the definition @xmath63 applies only in the cm frame .",
    "so , @xmath65 is a more convenient scaling variable for studying hadron mass effects , since it is invariant with respect to boosts along the direction of the hadron s spatial momentum .",
    "taking this direction to be the three - axis , and introducing a mass @xmath66 for the hadron , the momentum of the hadron in the cm frame reads @xmath67 therefore , the relation between the two scaling variables in the presence of hadron mass is @xmath68 note that these two variables are approximately equal when @xmath69 , _",
    "i.e. _  hadron mass effects can not be neglected when @xmath45 ( or @xmath65 ) are too small .    in the leading - twist component of the cross section after factorization , the hadron @xmath4",
    "is produced by fragmentation from a real , massless parton of momentum @xmath70 the @xmath71 component of everything other than this parton and of everything produced by the parton other than the observed hadron @xmath4 must be positive , implying that @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively . as a generalization of the massless case",
    ", we assume the cross section we have been calculating is @xmath74 , _",
    "@xmath75 which is related to the measured observable @xmath76 via @xmath77}\\ , \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\eta}(\\eta(x_p),s).\\ ] ] note that the effect of hadron mass is to reduce the size of the cross section at small @xmath45 ( or @xmath65 ) .",
    "the data we are studying are described by the sum of the production cross sections for each light charged hadron species , being the charged pion , the charged kaon , and the ( anti)proton , whose masses ( 140 , 494 , and 938  mev , respectively ) are substantially different .",
    "therefore , separate ffs and hadron masses for each of the three species are needed .",
    "clearly , so many free parameters would not be constrained by these data . however , since most of the produced particles are pions , it is reasonable to take the final - state hadrons to have the same mass , so that in our approach it is reasonable to use a single hadron mass parameter @xmath66 , whose fitted result should be closer to the pion mass than the proton mass , _",
    "i.e. _  around 300  mev .",
    "any significant deviation from this value would imply that some physics has not been accounted for .",
    "in a first test of our approach , we compare its effects on fits of quark and gluon ffs to @xmath78 data with the standard fo dglap evolution .",
    "we use normalized differential - cross - section data for the process @xmath79 , where @xmath4 is a light charged hadron and @xmath80 is anything else , from tasso at @xmath81 , 35 , 44 @xcite , and 22  gev @xcite , mark  ii @xcite and tpc @xcite at 29  gev , topaz at 58  gev @xcite , aleph @xcite , delphi @xcite , l3 @xcite , opal @xcite , and slc @xcite at 91  gev , aleph @xcite and opal @xcite at 133  gev , delphi at 161  gev @xcite , and opal at 172 , 183 , 189 @xcite , and 202  gev @xcite .",
    "we place a small-@xmath0 cut @xcite on our data of @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a mass scale of @xmath84  gev@xmath85 .",
    "we fit the gluon ff , @xmath86 , as well as the quark ffs , @xmath87 , \\nonumber\\\\ d_{uc}(x , q_0",

    "for each of these three ffs , we choose the parameterization @xmath90 which , at small @xmath0 , is a gaussian in @xmath91 for @xmath92 with center positive in @xmath91 for @xmath93 as is found to be the case , while it reproduces the standard parameterization ( _ i.e. _  that without the @xmath94 factor ) used in global fits at intermediate and large @xmath0 .",
    "we use eq .",
    "( [ dlarelfordquarkanddg ] ) to motivate the simplification @xmath95 to our parameterization .",
    "we also fit @xmath13 , so that there is a total of 9 free parameters . since we only use data for which @xmath96 , where @xmath97  gev is the mass of the bottom quark , and since @xmath98 , we take @xmath99 . while the precise choice for @xmath17 does not matter in the dla , calculations in the fo approach strongly depend on it .",
    "since the theoretical error in our lo approach is larger than that at nlo , some of our results should be interpreted somewhat qualitatively . in particular",
    ", the result for @xmath13 has a theoretical error of a factor of @xmath100 .    without the @xmath101 factors , eq .",
    "( [ dlarelfordquarkanddg ] ) implies that @xmath102 since the @xmath103 factors are important at large @xmath0 , where eq .",
    "( [ dlarelfordquarkanddg ] ) is no longer valid , we do not impose eq .",
    "( [ constraintsonac ] ) , but rather test its validity over the whole @xmath0 range .",
    ".[tab1]parameter values for the ffs at @xmath88  gev parameterized as in eq .",
    "( [ genparam ] ) from a fit , with @xmath104 , to all data listed in the text using dglap evolution in the fo approach to lo .",
    "the fit also yields @xmath105  mev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     fit to data as described in table  [ tab3].,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    we now perform the last fit again , but with @xmath66 included in the list of free parameters . we obtain the results in table  [ tab3 ] and fig .  [ fig4 ] , and the values @xmath106  mev and @xmath107  mev .",
    "treatment of hadron mass effects renders the value of @xmath13 obtained in the fit with dl resummation more reasonable and slightly improves the latter , yielding @xmath108 .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that to improve the large-@xmath91 description and to achieve a reasonable value for @xmath13 , both dl resummation and treatment of hadron mass effects are required .",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed a single unified scheme which can describe a larger range in @xmath0 than either fo dglap evolution or the dla , by implementing sgl resummation in the standard dglap formalism in a minimal and unambiguous way through any order of perturbation theory .",
    "our present limitation to lo is caused by the lack of knowledge on sgl resummation necessary to match nlo dglap evolution .",
    "the actual inclusion of higher orders , although conceptually straightforward in our scheme , requires a separate analysis , which lies beyond the scope of ref .",
    "@xcite and is left for future work .",
    "further improvement in the small-@xmath0 region can be expected from the inclusion of resummed sls .",
    "our scheme allows for a determination of quark and gluon ffs over a wider range of data than previously achieved , and should be incorporated into global fits of ffs such as that in ref .",
    "@xcite , since the current range of @xmath109 is very limited .",
    "since ffs and their dglap evolution are universal , our approach should be expected to also improve the description of inclusive hadron production from reactions other than @xmath78 annihilation , such as those involving at least one proton in the initial state .",
