    "the small - scale low - ionization structures ( lis ) of planetary nebulae were classified in terms of their morphology and kinematics by gonalves , corradi & mampaso ( 2001 ) as knots , jets and jetlike systems , either in pairs or isolated . from this , and subsequent works ( e.g. @xcite , and references therein ) it has became apparent that : i ) around 10% of the galactic pne are known to possess lis ; ii ) they are indistinctly spread among all the pne morphological classes ; iii ) 50% of these pne have highly collimated , high - velocity jets , and/or high - velocity pairs of knots ( fliers ; fast , low - ionization emission regions , @xcite ) ; and iv ) most of them are mainly photoionized",
    ".    however , a number of key questions remain open : are there significant density contrasts between lis and the higher ionization main components ( rims , attached shells and detached haloes ) of the nebula ? what are the typical electron densities of the different types of lis ?",
    "we are involved in a long - term project for characterizing the small - scale lis of pne since they can tell us much about the formation and evolution of pne .",
    "the main issues we can access by studying the lis are :    1 .   the collimation processes of lis in regard to those processes responsible for the shape of the pn itself , or the mass - loss processes during the agb and post - agb phases ; 2 .   the effect of the ionization front on the fossil agb features ; and 3 .   the role of disks and magnetic fields in shaping the highly collimated outflows ( jets ) in pne .    our motivation for the present analysis is to go a step further on the study of the different lis analyzing their densities .",
    "lis can move through their environments either with high or low velocity . in the first case ( the so - called fliers ) , radial velocities of @xmath1  with respect to the pn main components",
    "are typically measured @xcite , whereas in the second instance ( the slowers , slow moving low - ionization emission regions ; see @xcite ) the knots do not show peculiar velocities and share the typical 30  ( for elliptical shells ) to 100  ( for bipolar lobes ) expansion velocities of their host pne .",
    "a straightforward question arises from this : how is the density contrast between the lis and rims , shells or haloes correlated with the different velocity regimes ?    in this paper we analyse 4 pne that contain pairs of knots , either of high- or low - velocities .",
    "we present our spectroscopic data and treatment , in section  2 .",
    "the line fluxes obtained for as many as possible large- and small - scale components of the four pne , and the derived physical properties for each of the components are shown in sections 3 to 6 .",
    "finally , section 7 , is dedicated to the discussion of the results in terms of the match with the theoretical model predictions , and to our concluding remarks .",

    "we have estimated individual temperatures  and  for the different regions of the four nebulae studied in this paper .",
    "as it is well known , temperature errors are always important and they range in our case typically from around 1000 k for  in the brighter zones to more than 4000 k for  in the fainter regions",
    ". therefore , a sensible comparison of temperatures for the different components of each pn is precluded , and only rather general conclusions can be extracted : 1 ) temperatures are those of normal photoionized pne , varying from 9  500 to 14  500  k typically ; 2 )  agrees within the errors with  for every pn component measured .",
    "3 ) no relevant differences between  at the lis and at the higher excitation pn structures are found .",
    "the empirical density contrasts between the knots and the inner nebular regions , as described in this paper , are such that knots are typically 1 to 3 times _ less dense _ than the rims or cores of these pne ( ,  and ): in no one of the lis measured here the electronic density is definitely larger than at the main pn structures .",
    "this unexpected result is nevertheless also found in the full sample of pn with lis .",
    "table  4 of @xcite lists 26 pne with pairs of knots similar to those in the present work .",
    "we have searched in the literature for density measures both at the inner rims ( or shells ) of each pne and at their pairs of knots , finding eight pne ( in addition to the four nebulae here studied ) with adequate data . in all but one pn ( ngc  6826 ) the densities of the knots are _ equal or lower _ than those of the inner rims or shells , by factors between 1 and 10 .",
    "this result is not consistent with the theoretical expectations .",
    "the formation of pn major structures and pairs of jets / knots has been modeled in the past using a broad variety of processes and scenarios ( see , for instance , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "recent models can be grouped into three main families .",
    "i ) magnetohydrodynamic disk wind models , based on the scenario of accretion disks formed by binary interactions ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "ii ) interacting agb and post - agb wind models , in which the post - agb wind is driven exclusively by the magnetic pressure of a single star ( garca - segura , lpez & franco 2005 , @xcite ) .",
    "iii ) models that explore the effect of axisymmetrical light ( low density ) jets that , for a short period of time , expand into a spherical agb wind @xcite .",
    "some of the above models are particularly tailored to reproduce the main morphological and kinematic properties of a few well observed pne : he  3 - 401 , m2 - 9 and he  2 - 90 @xcite ; mz  3 and the pre - pn m1 - 92 @xcite . nevertheless , and despite the different assumptions of the different models , all of them are able to account for the formation of pne with jets .",
    "model predictions state that , after the eventual shut off of the jets , _",
    "dense _ knots would form embedded in the outer nebular components . moreover ,",
    "both the knots present at the tips of the existing jets and those left over when jets disappear are predicted to be denser than the inner pn components by large factors ranging from 10 up to 1000 ( typically 10 ) depending on the model assumptions .",
    "therefore , there is a clear disagreement between observed and modeled pairs of knots : the former are found to be typically 10 times less dense , while the latter are expected to be typically 10 times denser , than the inner rims and shells of their parent pn .    a straightforward possibility to reconcile the empirical and theoretical density contrasts is keeping in mind that empirical densities , as those measured here , correspond to only the ionized fraction of the pn gas .",
    "models , on the other hand , usually predict the formation of knots accounting for its morphology , kinematics and total gas content , but do not detail the ionization status of each component nor their evolution with time . the strong discrepancy between models and observations found here ( a typical factor of 100 )",
    "can therefore be explained if 90% or more of the low - ionization knots material is neutral .",
    "it is worth mentioning here the case of one prominent cometary globule of the helix nebula which contains the best known low - ionization knots of pne .",
    "the molecular matter ( h@xmath20 + co ; @xcite ) and the dust content @xcite of this knot amount to @xmath172@xmath1510@xmath27 , whereas @xcite estimated that the typical mass of the photoionized gas of a globule in helix is @xmath1710@xmath28 .",
    "in another well - studied system of knots , ngc  7009 , previous modeling by @xcite succeeded in reproducing the observed ionization structure and chemical abundances under the assumption that the total gas density of the knots is equal to the one empirically derived from the  lines @xcite , therefore , not accounting for any neutral matter .",
    "this apparently contradicts the present results suggesting that the knots might be mostly neutral .",
    "however , the effect of the density assumed for the knots in the modeling by @xcite is partly balanced by its geometry , i.e. , by its shape and size . as the shape was fixed based on the knots appearance in the hst images , the size was allowed to vary until it fits the observations ( i.e. the optical line ratios and electron density ) .",
    "for that reason @xcite were able to reproduce the observations of ngc  7009 without invoking need for neutral matter .",
    "it would be very interesting to attempt 3d photoionization modeling as in @xcite exploring high density regimes for the knots as suggested in this paper .",
    "@xcite have recently simulated the evolution of high - density ( 10@xmath16  @xmath0 ) , high - velocity ( 100 to 150  ) knots that travel away from a photoionizing source crossing a uniform lower density ( 10@xmath29  @xmath0 ) environment .",
    "they explored a range of initial conditions for the shocked knots ( in terms of photoinization rate ) , and qualitatively reproduced the emission - line ratios of several fliers , rims and shells observed in pre - pne and pne . at the end of the model evolution , 400  yr",
    ", the number densities for the knots are 10@xmath16 to 10@xmath6  @xmath0 , broadly in agreement with measured  of knots in ngc  7009 and ic  4634 .",
    "these simulations were indeed intended to reproduce the line ratios of the fliers of these two pne .",
    "no predictions are given for the properties of the other pn components ( rims , shells and haloes ) . in figure  6",
    "we show two of the diagnostic diagrams from @xcite comparing empirical and theoretical line ratios for fliers , as well as showing a compilation of empirical data for rims and shells of some pne .",
    "6 shows , first , that most of the inner regions ( rims and shells ) of the pne in our sample occupy the same zone as the rims and shells of other pne in the literature .",
    "second , the same is true for the zone occupied by the pairs of knots in  and  ( open boxes and circles ) with respect to the zones of the fliers sample in @xcite .",
    "third , knots in the other two nebulae ,  and ( open triangles and stars ) , are displaced from the empirical zone of fliers in @xcite .",
    "their locations are consistent with the results of simulations with the highest initial velocity of the knots ( 150  , model a / b / c/150 ) , and indicate that a mixing of shock and photo ionization is playing a role in the measured emission - line ratios .",
    "in fact , the highly supersonic velocity ( radial velocity of 226 ; @xcite ) measured in   for the se knot at p.a.=98@xmath25 could explain this agreement . expansion velocities of s knots are more moderate ( @xmath17 47 ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite show that models with low photoionization rates yield line ratios typical of shock - excited knots , whereas in models with higher photoionization rate , photoionized emission dominates the spectrum of the high - velocity , high - density knots .",
    "this strengthen the idea that it is evolution ( pn age ; see @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) and photoionization rate ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , rather than the highly supersonic velocities of the knots , the key parameters to separate the shock - excited from the photoionized structures in planetary nebulae .",
    "we have derived the physical parameters of low - ionization pairs of knots , and of higher ionization pn main components for a small sample of nebulae ( , ,  and ) .",
    "we have shown that electron temperatures at the knots are comparable to the temperatures of the main nebular components , rims and shells , whereas densities in the latter structures are significantly higher than in the pairs of knots , by up to a factor of 2 .",
    "typical knots densities in the studied pne are 500 to 2  000  @xmath0 .    we have argued that optical line ratios are not appropriate to constrain the total gas density , as they only account for the ionized matter of the knots , whereas none of the available models properly explore the knots ionization fraction , but the total ( neutral plus ionized ) density structure . a direct comparison of our results , plus compiled literature data , with the theoretical density contrasts expected from model predictions , yields a clear discrepancy that amount , typically , up to a factor of 100 .",
    "to reconcile models and observations we suggest that an important fraction of the gas at the knots 90% should be neutral .",
    "the results presented here can help in constraining more realistic models for jets and knots in pne , by providing empirical physical parameters of the ionized gas .",
    "we have analyzed the location of the knots of our four pne in diagnostic diagrams studied by @xcite concluding that the observed line emission ratios are compatible with shocked knots traveling in the photoionized outer regions of their host pne .",

    "<S> we obtained optical long - slit spectra of four planetary nebulae ( pne ) with low - ionization pair of knots , namely , ,  and .    </S>",
    "<S> these data allow us to derive the physical parameters and excitation of the pairs of knots , and those of higher ionization inner components of the nebulae , separately .    </S>",
    "<S> our results are as follows . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) the electron temperatures of the knots are within the range 9  500 to 14  500  k , similar to the temperatures of the higher ionization rims / shells . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) typical knots densities are 500 to 2  000  @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) empirical densities of the inner rims / shells are higher than those of the pairs of knots , by up to a factor of 10 </S>",
    "<S> . theoretical predictions , at variance with the empirical results , suggest that knots should be denser than the inner regions , by at least a factor of 10 . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) empirical and theoretical density contrasts can be reconciled if we assume that at least 90% of the knots gas is neutral ( likely composed of dust and molecules ) . </S>",
    "<S> 5 ) by using @xcite shock modeling and diagnostic diagrams appropriated for spatially resolved pne , we suggest that high - velocity shocked knots traveling in the photoionized outer regions of pne can explain the emission of the pairs of knots analysed in this paper .    </S>",
