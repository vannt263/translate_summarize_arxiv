    "in the standard cosmological model , the friedmann equations are derived from hilbert action , coupling the metric with ad hoc matter sources . in string theory ,",

    "one of the most important applications is to develop a string cosmology @xcite .",
    "there exist two ways to improve this string effective action @xcite .",
    "the first one is @xmath3-controlled expansion , which includes higher derivatives of the metric and background fields .",
    "another one is string coupling @xmath4-controlled expansion ( higher - genus expansion ) and which reflects the higher loop string interactions .",
    "the @xmath2-controlled expansion , which becomes significant in planck and high curvature region , had been discussed in @xcite . when curvature and energy scale grow up , the usual simplest perturbative expansion of the string effective action becomes no - go theorem . in this condition",

    "a good review of string cosmology is given by @xcite and references therein .",
    "the instabilities associated with open string tachyon is well understood presently .",
    "the stable vacuum is the vacuum of closed string without open string excitations and d - branes .",
    "the open string tachyon rolls down from the perturbative unstable vacuum to an excited state of closed string carrying the energy of the d - brane . on the other hand , the instabilities associated with closed string tachyon is a much more difficult problem since the action is non - polynomial .",

    "the conjecture that the action has to vanish at the closed string field theory ( csft ) vacuum , made in @xcite , is also implied . at the closed string vacuum , parallel to the conclusions in open string theory , one is led to believe that spacetime itself ceases to exist . to make these conjectures more reliable , higher order calculations or more desirable analytical methods are necessary .    for these reasons , studying the string effective action that couples the metric , the dilaton and",
    "the tachyon is of importance .",

    "the aim of this paper is an extension of @xcite to study the @xmath2 corrections of the graviton - dilaton - tachyon system .",
    "the @xmath2 correction should also satisfy the quantum conformal invariance and then brings higher derivative terms of gravitational field as well as other background fields . to preserve the covariance and gauge invariance , the same expansion order of @xmath2 could lead to different effective actions @xcite . to simplify the story ,",

    "the rolling process triggered by the tachyon was investigated for tachyonic potentials .",
    "it was found that during the rolling process , the string metric did not evolve while the dilaton rolled to strong coupling . in the framework of @xmath1 gravity , our analysis shows some interesting results . in section [ sec : trs ] , we find for tachyon - induced rolling solutions that time evolution of the string metric could be nontrivial in some cases . in section [ sec",
