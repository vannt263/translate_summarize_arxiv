    "quantum optimal control theory ( qoct ) which incorporates the optimal control theory with the quantum theory is a powerful tool and has attained various physical achievements @xcite .",
    "it has also been introduced to quantum gate control to obtain the optimal control pulses in quantum gate operations . in the literature , quantum gate control employing qoct in closed or open systems",
    "are studied @xcite . however , in most investigations where the environment effect is taken into account , the dynamics are often derived perturbatively , involving born @xcite or born - markov approximations @xcite . despite the broad applicability of the perturbative master equation , the approximations made in the derivation results in unwanted intrinsic error , which in turn contributes to the gate error as the pulse sequence for the gate operation is obtained through the approximated master equation . in cases",
    "where the models can be exactly solved , resorting to the exact dynamics can help reduce these possible intrinsic errors .    in this paper , we adopt an exact master equation of a qubit @xcite and combine it with qoct based on the krotov iteration method @xcite to find the optimal control pulse for state - independent single - qubit gate control in a general non - markovian environment with an arbitrary spectral density .",
    "to be specific , the model we consider is a qubit linearly coupled to a dissipative zero - temperature environment through a qubit lowering operator @xmath1 .",
    "the exact master equation for this model can be derived from either the pseudo mode method @xcite or the quantum state diffusion equation @xcite .",
    "reasonable trends of gate error for this model under various conditions are observed and discussed . moreover ,",
    "if the bath spectral density is chosen to be a lorentzian type , this dissipative qubit model can be shown to be equivalent to the damped jaynes - cummings model describing the coupling of a qubit to a single cavity mode which in turn is coupled to a markovian reservoir @xcite .",
    "thus our optimal control results would also have direct applications , for example , to superconducting circuit quantum electrodynamic ( qed ) systems @xcite that are described very well by the damped jaynes - cummings model and are controlled relatively easily by external fields .    another important property",
    "we wish to investigate is whether or not in open systems , qoct is able to correct the gate error due to the environment effect .",
    "a quantity , improvement @xmath0 , is defined to quantify such correction . for a system where the improvement is large , including the environment effect becomes essential to the control problem .",
    "whereas for a system with negligible improvement , the optimal control pulse developed while the system is considered closed would suffice .",
    "we further explore the region of parameters where significant improvement is achieved , and find that improvement is in close relation to the structure of the environment .",
    "we note here that in cases where the open quantum system models are not exactly solvable , one will have to turn to the perturbative master equation approaches for the optimal control solution @xcite . however , in certain models where the exact master equations are available , our present treatment bears the advantage of ruling out the intrinsic errors due to the perturbative dynamics .",
    "only a few non - markovian open quantum system models can be exactly solved @xcite , and exact dissipative models of a two - level system are even fewer .",
    "the total hamiltonian @xmath2 of the two - level qubit model we consider consists of three parts @xcite ( set @xmath3 ) : @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the qubit transition frequency ; @xmath6 is the pauli-@xmath7 matrix ; and @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the creation and annihilation operator for the bath oscillator with eigenfrequency @xmath10 . in this exactly solvable model , the qubit is linearly coupled to the zero - temperature environment through the lindblad operator @xmath11 with coupling constant @xmath12 .",
    "we choose the qubit transition frequency as the time - dependent control parameter , @xmath13 .",
    "in real experiments , @xmath5 is often tunable and is a possible agent of external control .",

    "equation ( [ eq : f_diff_eq ] ) is a nonlocal integro - differential equation and is not easy to solve for a general bath spectral density and thus to incorporate within the framework of qoct .",

    "physically , the effect of phase shift and dissipation can be understood as the result of qubit transition frequency shift , namely , lamb shift , and qubit decay . in the lorentzian environment with zero detuning , @xmath112",
    ", the spectral density is peaked at and symmetric with respect to @xmath113 .",
    "as the numerical results indicate , the decay rate becomes large and the dissipation effect becomes prominent . on the other hand ,",
    "the lamb shift is relatively small due to the symmetric distribution of spectral density with respect to qubit frequency @xmath113 . in this case",
    "the dissipation effect dominates over the phase shift effect , and the improvement due to the optimal control is small .",
    "however , if the environment central frequency is detuned from the qubit frequency , our numerical results indicate that qubit decay drops dramatically , but the lamb shift does not change much .",
    "this is due to the asymmetric distribution of the spectral density with respect to qubit frequency @xmath113 and the result consequently leads to significant improvement .",

    "similar arguments apply to the ohmic case .",
    "the overall coupling strength @xmath66 ( or @xmath71 ) is irrelevant to the improvement since it does not affect the shape of the spectral density but only the overall value .",
    "so far , we have observed very limited suppression of dissipation applying qoct to the two - level dissipative model .",
    "this consequence is model specific , and is due to the control range we specify . in eq .",

    "note that the gating time is shorter than that of the small range control , and furthermore the gate error is smaller than that of the small ranged control by several orders .",

    "the perturbative master equation approaches should be employed for the optimal control solutions @xcite . however , for models where the exact master equations are available , our present treatment , in contrast to the commonly used perturbation method , is valid for all orders and free from intrinsic error .",

    "we introduce the definition of improvement and find that , improvement is directly related to the mathematical nature of @xmath24 . physically , improvement is in close relation to the shape of the spectral density with respect to the qubit transition frequency .",
