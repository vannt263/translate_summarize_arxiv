    "populations of asteroids in the jovian first order mean motion resonances j2/1 , j3/2 and j4/3 are closely linked to the orbital evolution of the giant planets .",
    "this is because of their orbital proximity to jupiter .",
    "stability or instability of these asteroid populations directly derives from the orbital configuration of the giant planets . as such it is also sensitive on the nature and amount of jupiter s migration and other finer details of its dynamics . as a result ,",
    "the currently observed asteroids in the jovian first order resonances contain valuable information about the early evolution of planets and , if correctly understood and properly modelled , they may help to constrain it .",
    "apart from the trojan clouds ( not studied in this paper ) the largest known population in the jovian mean motion resonances occupies the j3/2 resonance , and is frequently called the hilda group . it was carefully studied in a parallel series of papers by schubart and dahlgren and collaborators during the past few decades .",
    "schubart ( 1982a , b , 1991 ) analysed short - term dynamics of hilda - type orbits and introduced quasi - constant orbital parameters that allowed their first classification . while pioneering , schubart s work had the disadvantage of having much smaller sample of known asteroids and computer power than today .",
    "dahlgren & lagerkvist ( 1995 ) and dahlgren et  al .",
    "( 1997 , 1998 , 1999 ) conducted the first systematic spectroscopic and rotation - rate investigation of hildas .",
    "they found about equal abundance of d- and p - type asteroids and suggested spectral - size correlation such that p - types dominate large hildas and d - type dominate smaller hildas .",
    "they also suggested small hildas have large lightcurve amplitudes , as an indication of elongated or irregular shape , and that the distribution of their rotation rates is non - maxwellian .",
    "further analysis using the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data however does not support significant dominance of either of the two spectral types for small sizes and indicates about equal mix of them ( gil - hutton & brunini 2008 ; see also below ) .",
    "smaller populations of asteroids in the j2/1 and j4/3 received comparatively less observational effort .    since the late 1990s powerful - enough computers allowed a more systematic analysis of fine details of the longer - term dynamics in the jovian first order resonances .",

    "( 1998a , b ) determined that asteroids in the j2/1 resonance can be very long - lived , possibly primordial , yet their motion is comparatively more chaotic than those in the j3/2 resonance .",
    "the latter paper showed that commensurability between the libration period and the period of jupiter s and saturn s great inequality might have played an important role in depletion of the j2/1 resonance .",
    "this would have occurred when both giant planets were farther from their mutual 2:5 mean motion configuration in the past .",
    "a still more complete analysis was obtained by nesvorn & ferraz - mello ( 1997 ) who also pointed out that the j4/3 resonance stable zone is surprisingly void of asteroids , containing only ( 279 ) thule .",

    "( 2001 ) and bro et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) recently revised the population of asteroids in the j2/1 resonance and classified them into several groups according to their long - term orbital stability .",
    "while the origin of the unstable resonant population was successfully interpreted using a model of a steady - state flow of main belt objects driven by the yarkovsky semimajor axis drift , the origin of the long - lived asteroids in the j2/1 remains elusive .",
    "population of hildas and thule was assumed primordial or captured by an adiabatic migration of jupiter ( e.g. , franklin et  al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "it has been known for some time that the current configuration of giant planets does not correspond to that at their birth . however , a new momentum to that hypothesis was given by the so called nice model ( tsiganis et  al .",
    "2005 ; morbidelli et  al . 2005 ; gomes et  al .",
    "the nice model postulates the initial configuration of the giant planets was such that jupiter and saturn were interior of their mutual 1:2 mean motion resonance ( see also morbidelli et  al .",
    "the event of crossing this resonance had a major influence on the final architecture of giant planets and strongly influenced structure of small - bodies populations in the solar system .",
    "morbidelli et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) showed that the population of jupiters trojan asteroids was destabilised and re - populated during this phase . in what follows",
    "we show that , within the nice model , the same most probably occurs for populations of asteroids in the j3/2 and j4/3 resonances .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section  [ popul ] we revise information about the current populations of asteroids in the jovian first order resonances .",
    "we use an up - to - date astorb database of asteroid orbits from the lowell observatory ( ftp.lowell.edu ) as of september  2007 and eliminate only single - opposition cases to assure accurate orbital information .",
    "in section  [ fams ] we apply clustering techniques and extract two families of asteroids on similar orbits in the j3/2 resonance .",
    "we strengthen their case with an additional colour analysis using the sdss broadband data .",
    "we model the long - term orbital evolution of these families and estimate their ages on the basis of yarkovsky - driven dispersion in eccentricity .",
    "in section  [ stability ] we determine an orbital stability of the putative primordial populations of planetesimals in the jovian first - order resonances .",
    "we show that those in the j3/2 and j4/3 are very efficiently eliminated when jupiter and saturn cross their mutual 1:2 mean motion resonance .",
    "we also determine the removal rate of very small resonant asteroids due to the yarkovsky / yorp effects .",
    "dynamics of asteroid motion in the jovian first order resonances has been extensively studied by both analytical and numerical methods in the past few decades ( e.g. , murray 1986 ; sessin & bressane 1988 ; ferraz - mello 1988 ; lemaitre & henrard 1990 ; morbidelli & moons 1993 ; moons et  al .",

    "is reduced to a one - degree of freedom problem defined by a pair of variables @xmath9 . for j@xmath10 resonance ( @xmath11 and @xmath2 in our cases )",
    "we have @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the semimajor axis , @xmath14 the eccentricity , @xmath15 the longitude of pericentre and @xmath16 the mean longitude in orbit of the asteroid , and @xmath17 is the mean longitude in orbit of jupiter .",
    "if the asteroid motion is not confined into the orbital plane of the planet , we have an additional pair of resonant variables @xmath18 such that @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the inclination of asteroids orbit and @xmath21 the longitude of its node .",
    "remaining still with the simple averaged model , orbital effects with shorter periods are neglected , the motion obeys an integral of motion @xmath5 given by @xmath22 because of this integral of motion , variations of @xmath23 imply oscillations of both @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    the two - degree of freedom character of the resonant motion prevents integrability . however , as an approximation we may introduce a hierarchy by noting that perturbation described by the @xmath24 variables is larger than that described by the @xmath18 terms ( e.g. , moons et  al . 1998 ) .",
    "this is usually true for real resonant asteroids of interest . only the angle @xmath25 librates and @xmath26 circulates with a very long period .",
    "the @xmath27 dynamics thus produces a long - period perturbation of the @xmath9 motion .    within this model",
    "the minimum value of @xmath23 in one resonant cycle ( typically several hundreds of years ) implies @xmath13 is minimum and @xmath14 is maximum .",
    "these values do not conserve exactly from one cycle to another because the @xmath28 motion produces small oscillations . since @xmath29",
    "one needs to wait until @xmath30 reaches maximum over its cycle to attain ` real ' minimum of @xmath13 values and ` real ' maximum of @xmath14 values over a longer time interval . from ( [ res21 ] )",
    "we note the maximum of @xmath30 occurs for the maximum of @xmath20 variations .",
    "this situations occurs typically once in a few thousands of years . in an ideal situation",
    ", these extremal values of @xmath31 would be constant and may serve as a set of proper orbital elements .",
    "the motion of real asteroids in the solar system is further complicated by jupiter having non - zero and oscillating value of eccentricity .",
    "this brings further perturbations ( e.g. , ferraz - mello 1988 ; sessin & bressane 1988 for a simple analytic description ) and sources of instability inside the resonance . despite the non - integrability ,",
    "we follow roig et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) and introduce _ pseudo - proper orbital elements _ @xmath32 as the osculating elements @xmath33 at the moment , when the orbit satisfies the condition : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote the longitude of pericentre and the longitude of node of jupiter .",
    "as above , when ( [ prop1 ] ) holds the osculating orbital elements are such that @xmath13 attains minimum , @xmath14 attains maximum and @xmath20 attains maximum .",
    "numerical experiments show that with a complete perturbation model and a finite time - step it is difficult to satisfy all conditions of ( [ prop1 ] ) simultaneously .",
    "following roig et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) we thus relax ( [ prop1 ] ) to a more practical condition @xmath37 because this condition is only approximate , we numerically integrate orbits of resonant asteroids for 1myr , over which the pseudo - proper orbital elements are recorded .",
    "we then compute their mean value and standard deviation , which is an expression of the orbital stability over that interval of time .    in the case of the j3/2 and j4/3 resonances",
    ", we use the condition ( [ prop2 ] ) with a different sign @xmath38 and , moreover , we apply a digital filter ( denoted as  a in quinn et  al .",
    "( 1991 ) , using 1yr sampling and a decimation factor of  10 ) to @xmath39 .",
    "this intermediate stage serves to suppress oscillations faster than the libration period .",
    "the different sign of @xmath40 just means our pseudo - proper orbital elements correspond to maximum value of @xmath13 and minimum values of @xmath14 and @xmath20 , in order to allow more direct comparison with previous analyses .",
    "aside to this short - term integration we perform long - term runs to determine the stability of a particular resonant orbit . with this aim",
    "we conduct integrations spanning 4gyr for all resonant asteroids . because of the inherent uncertainty in the initial conditions ( orbital elements at the current epoch )",
    ", we perform such integration for the nominal orbit and @xmath41 clones that randomly span the uncertainty ellipsoid .",
    "we then define _ dynamical lifetime _ of the orbit as the median of time intervals , for which the individual clones stayed in the resonance .",
    "all integrations are performed using the swift package ( levison & duncan 1994 ) , slightly modified to include necessary on - line digital filters and a second order symplectic integrator ( laskar & robutel 2001 ) .",
    "most of numerical simulations take into account gravitational interactions only , but in specific cases  and when explicitly mentioned  we include also yarkovsky ( thermal ) accelerations .",
    "in this case we use an implementation described in detail by bro ( 2006 ) .",
    "our simulations include 4 outer planets .",
    "we modify the initial conditions of the planets and asteroids by a barycentric correction to partially account for the influence of the terrestrial planets .",
    "the absence of the terrestrial planets as perturbers is a reasonable approximation in the outer part of the main belt and for orbits with @xmath42 in general .",
    "we nevertheless checked the short - term computations ( determination of pseudo - proper resonant elements ) using a complete planetary model and noticed no significant difference in results .",
    "the second order symplectic scheme allows us to use a time step of 91  days .      in order to determine , which objects are located in the j2/1 mean motion resonance , we first extracted orbits from the astorb database with osculating orbital elements in a broad box around this resonance ( see , e.g. , roig et  al .",

    "[ r32-rtbp_filter_ssigma_100myr ] ) .",
    "because the position of this centre has a steep progression in the eccentricity and only small progression in the semimajor axis , the evolution across different @xmath5-planes makes the orbital eccentricity evolve significantly more than the semimajor axis .",

    "the shape of the librating orbit is modified such that the area @xmath91 stays approximately constant .",
    "we have verified that the relative change in both adiabatic invariants , acquired during the 100myr of evolution , is about the same : @xmath97 .",
    "it is a direct expression of the strength of the perturbation by the yarkovsky forces .",
    "we can conclude the yarkovsky effect results in a significantly different type of secular evolution for orbits initially inside strong first - order mean motion resonances with jupiter . instead of secularly pushing the orbital semimajor axis inward or outward from the sun",
    ", it drives the orbital eccentricity to smaller or larger values , while leaving the semimajor axis to follow the resonance centre .",
    "if we were to leave the orbital evolution continue in our simple model , the inward - migrating orbit would leave the resonance toward the zone of low - eccentricity apocentric librators .",
    "such bodies are observed just below the j2/1 resonance . on the other hand , the outward - migrating orbit would finally increase the eccentricity to the value when the orbit starts to cross the jupiters orbit . obviously , in a more complete model , with all planets included , the orbits would first encounter the unstable region surrounding the stable resonant zone .",
