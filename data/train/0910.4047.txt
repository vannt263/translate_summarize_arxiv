    "as a supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking scenario , gauge mediation @xcite presents many advantages .",
    "chief among these are its general calculability and its lack of flavour problem .",
    "calculability arises from the fact that the supersymmetry breaking sector can be fully described without appealing to the underlying , incalculable supergravity theory , whereas the flavour problem is solved because the messengers only interact with gauge field supermultiplets in the visible sector .",
    "such interactions do not generate problematic flavour changing soft terms .",
    "an even more theoretically appealing scenario is that of direct mediation @xcite . here , the visible sector gauge group is embedded into a flavour symmetry of the supersymmetry breaking sector .",
    "the messengers are thus generated by the dynamics of the theory so there is no need for an additional messenger sector .",
    "unfortunately direct gauge mediation suffers from two particular problems .",
    "many models of direct mediation suffer from the landau pole problem , where the inclusion of messenger fields ( charged under both the susy breaking and visible sector gauge groups ) pushes the theory towards strong coupling in the ultraviolet .",
    "another common problem is the surprisingly small gaugino mass to sfermion mass ratios generated by these models .",
    "phenomenological constraints that the gaugino masses are above the weak scale thus force very heavy sfermions , leading to fine tuning .    a way to address the smallness of the gaugino masses",
    "was discussed in @xcite ; it appears that they are connected to global properties of the theory s vacua . for gaugino masses in a given vacuum to be non - zero at leading order in the susy breaking where @xmath3 is the vev that breaks @xmath2-symmetry .",
    "this is usually small in models of direct mediation so the leading order contribution is dominant , although in known examples with large susy breaking the gaugino mass still seems anomalously small .",
    "] there must exist lower energy states elsewhere in the pseudomoduli space _ at tree level_. explicit realisations of this idea can be found in the literature : refs .",
    "@xcite consider uplifted vacua , whereas @xcite considers a lower energy vacuum pulled in from infinity .",
    "metastability occurs at tree level in all of these examples and @xmath4-terms .",
    "we will only discuss @xmath5-term susy breaking here . ] and , as such , they include arbitrary deformations that break @xmath2-symmetry .",
    "rather disturbingly this renders the theories non - generic .",
    "moreover , some degree of fine tuning appears to be necessary .",
    "the question then arises as to whether the uplifted vacuum scenario can be put on a more natural footing within the framework of intriligator , seiberg and shih ( iss ) @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will see that indeed it can be , using the approach of @xcite in which all deformations and scales appearing in the ir magnetic theory are motivated by appealing to the uv electric theory .    to achieve this we analyse uplifted vacua in massive supersymmetric qcd ( sqcd ) , as in @xcite , but restrict our attention to the magnetic gauge group of @xmath0 . in this case",
    "the vacua can be stabilised by baryon deformations .",
    "baryon deformations in the magnetic theory map to non - renormalisable operators in the electric theory so come with a natural suppression .",
    "however , the emergent mass hierarchy and the smallness of the magnetic gauge group eliminate the landau pole problem typically encountered in @xmath6 gut models of direct mediation .",
    "in addition , it is possible to have only two distinct mass scales in the electric theory : the weak scale @xmath7 and some high scale , such as the planck scale or the gut scale .",
    "both of these scales have obvious physical significance .",
    "any extra deformations required to stabilise the vacuum or mediate the susy breaking to the visible sector are also well understood .",
    "turning off the susy breaking restores an @xmath2-symmetry that forbids all operators other than those required .",
    "it is well known that breaking @xmath2-symmetry is already a necessary requirement for metastable susy breaking in generic models @xcite . in this model the mass term in the electric theory that induces susy breaking ( as in the iss model ) actually becomes the order parameter for both the susy breaking _ and _ the @xmath2-symmetry breaking .",
    "finally , the main example we present makes two concrete predictions .",
    "the first is to fix the effective number of messengers at @xmath1 .",
    "the second is the existence of new , tev scale particles charged under the standard model .",
    "such particles should be clearly visible at the lhc so the theory can readily be tested .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : rev ] we briefly review the arguments of @xcite and show how they were applied to uplifted vacua in massive sqcd by the authors of @xcite . in ",
    "[ sec : bd ] we see how a vacuum at the origin can instead be stabilised by adding baryon deformations to the superpotential when the magnetic gauge group is @xmath0 . in ",
    "[ sec : g ] and  [ sec : dm ] we show how this type of model can be implemented in direct mediation scenarios and discuss the phenomenological ramifications in  [ sec : pv ] .",
    "we conclude in  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we begin with a brief review of @xcite , explaining why large gaugino masses require uplifted vacua . for the simplest general model of gauge mediation",
    "@xcite we have a superpotential w=^i_j_i^j+m^i_j_i^j .",
    "@xmath8 is a spurion whose @xmath5-term gets a susy breaking vev and the @xmath9 s are messengers which live in the ( conjugate ) fundamental representation of the visible sector gauge group , e.g.  @xmath10 of @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 are coupling constants .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the scalar component of @xmath8 must be massless at tree level , i.e.  it is a pseudomodulus or flat direction of the theory .",
    "the gaugino masses are consequently expected to be a function of @xmath8 , where we now use @xmath8 to denote the scalar component .",
    "indeed , one finds @xcite m_~_(^i_j+m^i_j ) at lowest order .",
    "the gaugino mass can only be non - zero at this order if @xmath13 , which is a polynomial in @xmath8 , is @xmath8 dependent .",
    "if this is the case there must be some value @xmath14 for which @xmath15 .",
    "since @xmath16 is also the mass matrix of fermionic messengers this means there are massless fermionic messengers at @xmath14 . in @xcite",
    "the authors demonstrate that a massless fermionic messenger always leads to a massless or tachyonic scalar .",
    "if one follows the direction of this scalar , and the messenger does not decouple from the theory , the energy can be shown to decrease . hence the only way to achieve @xmath17 is for there to exist _ tree level _ states at lower energy somewhere in the pseudomoduli space .",
    "in order to define notation we will start with a brief discussion of the iss model @xcite .",
    "consider @xmath18 sqcd with gauge group @xmath19 and flavour symmetry @xmath20 .",
    "the matter content of the theory consists of quarks @xmath21 and antiquarks @xmath22 and there is no superpotential . for @xmath23",
    "this theory has a dual description @xcite : sqcd with gauge group @xmath24",
    "where n = n_f - n .",
    "the global symmetry group is @xmath25 and the matter content consists of quarks @xmath26 , antiquarks @xmath27 and a gauge singlet meson field @xmath28 .",
    "it is summarised in table [ tab : issmm ] .",
    "q_ia & & & & & 1- + ^ja & & & & - & 1- + ^i_j & & & & 0 & +    the dual theory has superpotential w_mg=^ja^i_jq_ia where @xmath29 is a coupling constant .",
    "we typically refer to the @xmath19 theory as the electric theory and the @xmath24 theory as the magnetic theory .",
    "there is a one to one correspondence between gauge invariant operators in the two theories .",
    "the meson map is the obvious choice _ j^aq^i_a^i_j and the baryon map is @xmath30 with @xmath31 denoting contraction with a rank @xmath32 alternating tensor .",
    "@xmath33 is the scale of the theory which is included to ensure the dimensions of the operators match .",
    "it is well known @xcite that this theory has a susy breaking vacuum for @xmath34 ( or equivalently @xmath35 ) when the electric theory is deformed by a quark mass term [ eq : isswel ] w_el = m_q_i^aq^i_a with @xmath36 .",
    "this term breaks the @xmath20 flavour symmetry to a diagonal @xmath37 subgroup and also leaves only an anomalous @xmath2-symmetry , which is broken by non - perturbative effects . in the magnetic theory",
    "the superpotential is deformed to [ eq : isswmg ] w_mg=^ja^i_jq_ia-^2^i_i with @xmath38 , so the @xmath5-term for the meson field is f__i^j = h(^jaq_ia-^2_i^j ) .",
    "the operator @xmath39 is at most a rank @xmath40 matrix , whereas @xmath41 is rank @xmath42 . since @xmath43",
    "we know that @xmath44 so the @xmath45 can not all be set to zero .",
    "supersymmetry is thus broken by the rank condition and the vacuum is [ eq : issvac ]     (    c_n + 0    )    , = 0,v_tree=(n_f - n)h^2 ^ 4 where @xmath46 denotes the @xmath47 identity matrix .",
    "some of the components of @xmath28 are pseudomoduli but are stabilised by the coleman - weinberg potential at one - loop .",
    "when non - perturbative effects are taken into account we find a supersymmetric vacuum at large @xmath28 .",
    "hence this vacuum is only metastable , but remains globally stable at tree level .",
    "this metastability is important but the fact that it appears only after non - perturbative effects are considered precludes the possibility that it allows for anything other than small gaugino masses in a gauge mediation scenario .      in @xcite",
    "some other vacua of massive sqcd were investigated .",
    "the vacuum of allows the matrix @xmath48 to fulfil its maximal rank , @xmath40 , but by reducing the rank one can find other stationary points at higher energies than @xmath49 .",
    "specifically , in @xmath49 we have q=    (    ll_n & 0_n(n_f - n ) + 0_(n_f - n)n & 0_(n_f - n)(n_f - n )    )    but we could have [ eq : upvsp ] q=    (    ll_n - k & 0_(n - k)(n_f+k - n ) + 0_(n_f+k - n)(n - k ) & 0_(n_f+k - n)(n_f+k - n )    )    for some positive integer @xmath50 .",
    "such states remain stationary points of the tree level potential - flat direction . ]",
    "v_tree=|f|^2 . but have a higher vacuum energy @xmath51 and so are uplifted with respect to @xmath49 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that these uplifted vacua can be stabilised in the quantum theory by adding an operator @xmath52 with non - trivial index contraction to the electric theory .",
    "in addition , the parameter @xmath53 must be split into two different mass scales , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , by replacing @xmath56 with @xmath57 and @xmath58 in the electric theory . as discussed in  [ sec : kom ] , using an uplifted vacuum in a direct mediation scenario allows the visible sector gauginos to acquire a similar mass to the sfermions .",
    "this was shown explicitly to be the case in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately that model required both the introduction of an additional low mass scale and fine tuning between @xmath57 , @xmath58 and the @xmath52 coupling constant .",
    "what s more , the relative sizes of the scales are somewhat mysterious , with large ratios appearing for an unexplained reasons and the landau pole problem persists in most cases as well .",
    "suppose we focus on the state @xmath59 in undeformed massive sqcd ; the extremal case of with @xmath60 .",
    "the vev of the tree level potential in this state is @xmath61 . unlike the iss vacuum , _ all _ components of @xmath28",
    "are massless at tree level so should be considered as pseudomoduli , but we can use the remaining @xmath37 flavour symmetry to make @xmath28 diagonal . to investigate the stability of the stationary point we calculate the bosonic and fermionic mass squared matrices m_b^2=    (    cc w^acw_cb & w^abcw_c + w_abcw_c & w_acw^cb    )    , and m_f^2=    (    cc w^acw_cb & 0 + 0 & w_acw^cb    )    respectively . using the superpotential ,",
    "the eigenstates and corresponding eigenvalues in the scalar quark sector around @xmath59 are q^ : _",
    "b^2=h^2(||^2 ^ 2 ) with equivalent relations for the conjugate states .",
    "we see that @xmath62 becomes tachyonic when @xmath63 , in which case the theory flows back to the iss vacuum . as a result",
    ", we need to stabilise @xmath64 above @xmath53 for the stationary point to be a vacuum of the theory .",
    "this might be accomplished at one - loop by the coleman - weinberg potential @xcite [ eq:0cwdef ] v_cw=^4()= which evaluates to @xmath65}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for each diagonal meson component @xmath66 .",
    "for @xmath67 it can be approximated by [ eq:0cwapprox ] v_cw .",
    "this function has no minimum , ergo @xmath68 can not be stabilised with @xmath69 .",
    "actually , this approximation becomes valid even when @xmath68 is only a little higher than @xmath53 so we find that @xmath28 can not be stabilised at a suitable value at all .",
    "this problem was discussed in more detail in @xcite , where the solution was to add a second quark mass scale to the electric theory @xmath70 . a stable vacuum",
    "can then be found when @xmath68 lies between the two scales .",
    "if we want to stabilise the diagonal components of the pseudomodulus @xmath28 ( @xmath66 ) by adding an operator to the superpotential there are two simple options . the first is to add a meson deformation to the superpotential of : w_mgw_mg+f ( ) where @xmath71 is a polynomial of order @xmath72 . such a function",
    "can easily be generated in the electric theory .",
    "this deformation would lead to several supersymmetric vacua .",
    "specifically , the @xmath5-term for @xmath66 becomes f_=h(f^()-^2 ) at @xmath59 .",
    "the expression on the right hand side is an order @xmath73 polynomial so has @xmath73 roots and thus leads to @xmath73 supersymmetric vacua . if we desire a non - supersymmetric vacuum we must find a stationary point of the one - loop potential @xmath74 which is _ not _ a solution to @xmath75 .",
    "this is only possible if @xmath74 has more than @xmath73 minima . using the expression for the tachyon free regime",
    "we find @xmath76 @xmath77 is therefore an order @xmath78 polynomial which has @xmath78 roots .",
    "no more than half of these can be minima , leaving at most @xmath73 minima ; exactly the same as the number of supersymmetric minima .",
    "we thus conclude that a non - supersymmetric vacuum with @xmath59 can not be stabilised in this way .",
    "the second option is to deform the superpotential with a baryonic deformation .",
    "although baryonic deformations were discussed in a similar context in @xcite the vacua studied here are not the same",
    ". we will be interested in vacua which are uplifted with respect to those in @xcite and hence have very different phenomenological properties .",
    "baryonic deformations do not include @xmath28 explicitly so can only stabilise it via the coleman - weinberg potential .",
    "as such , we restrict ourselves to the magnetic gauge group @xmath0 where baryonic deformation look like mass terms .",
    "the superpotential is deformed to [ eq : bddef ] w_mgq-^2+m_q^(2)q_1q_2+_q_(2)^1 ^ 2 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are dimension 1 coupling constants and @xmath81 represents contraction over the colour indices with a rank 2 alternating tensor .",
    "the subscripts on the quarks ( superscripts on the antiquarks ) denote flavour indices so we see that this deformation explicitly breaks the global symmetry group , from @xmath82 down to @xmath83 .",
    "the other flavour and colour indices have now been suppressed .",
    "the baryonic deformation retains the classical stationary point at @xmath59 and does not change the status of @xmath28 as a pseudomodulus .",
    "however , breaking the flavour symmetry forces us to expand around this vacuum in components [ eq : bdexpan ] q=    (    c x + y    )    , =    (    cc &    )    , =    (    cc & + &    )    where @xmath84 and @xmath8 are @xmath85 matrices , @xmath86 and @xmath9 are @xmath87 matrices and @xmath88 is a @xmath89 matrix ( with transposed relations for letters with a tilde ) .",
    "the baryon deformation only affects the @xmath0 flavour sector ( we will discuss the remainder of the theory later ) and we can again use the residual flavour symmetry to restrict our attention to the diagonal components of @xmath28 .",
    "the relevant superpotential terms are therefore w_mgx-^2+m_q^(2)x_1x_2+_q_(2)^1 ^ 2 . for this superpotential ,",

    "it is then possible to numerically interpolate between these extreme examples .",
    "first , consider the case @xmath95 , i.e.  @xmath93 .",

    "mediation to the @xmath165 sector occurs via visible sector interactions so is suppressed by an extra loop .",
    "this approach leads to an interesting signature : @xmath165 masses would be less than @xmath0 masses by a factor of one loop",

    "unfortunately , it is difficult to embed the visible sector gauge group into @xmath166 so using this method in a direct mediation scenario is of limited practical use .",
    "we now discuss some phenomenological aspects of the @xmath137 direct mediation scenario of  [ sec : nf-2 ] . for simplicity we will analyse the minimal case : take @xmath169 and embed the visible sector in an @xmath6 gut .",

    "@xmath29 is simply an order 1 coupling constant that translates directly from the electric theory .",

    "these operators are the only single trace , perturbative operators in the electric theory which are consistent with its symmetries ( including the @xmath2-symmetry discussed in  [ sec : nf-2 ] ) and of dimension six or below .",
    "higher dimension operators could exist but will be suppressed so can be discarded . from dimensional arguments we expect ~,m_q~()^2,~()^3,m_~ ( ) and then , from , s whose fermions get masses @xmath172 m_y~m_q(),m_~. in  [ sec : g ] and  [ sec : nf-2 ] we required m_q16,and for the vacuum to be stable , which corresponds to [ eq : pvineq1 ] m_q10 ^ -9,and 10 ^ -1 .",
    "the gaugino mass scale was calculated in . for this to be around the weak scale ( assuming @xmath173 ) , we require [ eq : pvineq2 ] m_~~10 ^ -2m_q()^2~100m_q~()^210",
    "^ 4 . finally , for the theory to remain calculable we need mass contributions from the khler potential , which go like @xmath174 @xcite , to be smaller than masses generated at one loop , which go like @xmath175 .",
    "this last constraint tells us that so is already satisfied by when @xmath173 .",
    "by approximating the minimum in figure [ fig : nf-2v1l ] with a triangular potential barrier we can make a rough estimate of the bounce action @xcite , and therefore the lifetime of the uplifted minimum .",

    "for @xmath180 the bounce action is well approximated by @xmath181 .",
    "all of these constraints are consistent with one another and leave a wide range of choices for the three fundamental parameters input into the electric theory ; @xmath56 , @xmath33 and @xmath171 ( assuming all dimensionless couplings are of order 1 ) .",
    "if we minimise the number of scales by saturating and taking @xmath182 , tells us that we will always require @xmath183 and will achieve a stable vacuum for any high scale @xmath184 .",
    "this is quite an attractive scenario as we effectively only require two scales : a high scale @xmath171 ( such as the planck scale or the gut scale ) and the weak scale of @xmath185 .",

    "the mass of the @xmath86 s is less than 10 tev which is insufficient for their relic density to overclose the universe @xcite , but the mass of the @xmath9 s is large enough to cause cosmological problems .",
    "gravitational interactions can , however , induce extra superpotential terms that violate messenger number symmetry and allow decays to @xmath86 s or visible sector particles @xcite . ]",
    "[ eq : pvmessmass ] m_y~10m_q~10 ^ 3,m_~10 ^ -5m10 ^ 7,m_~10 ^ -2m10 ^ 10 .",
    "the splitting of the masses in the @xmath9 sector is much smaller than their central mass scale , so @xmath187 applies to both the fermionic and bosonic components of the @xmath9 s .",
    "we find an important prediction from : the existence of two pairs of new particles ( @xmath86 and @xmath188 ) charged under the visible sector gauge group with masses independent of @xmath171 at about @xmath189 .",
    "these particles should be visible at the lhc as they would couple to the visible sector through standard model gauge interactions .",

    "deflect the running .",
    "as long as @xmath190 we reach @xmath191 before @xmath192 reaches zero so avoid the landau pole problem._[fig : pvlp],width=302 ]    in the visible sector the first coupling constant to hit a landau pole as we go up in energy in a standard @xmath6 gut will always be @xmath193 ( see figure [ fig : pvlp ] ) . the @xmath194-function coefficient for the qcd gauge coupling constant is b_qcd=3-_mess(e ) where @xmath195 is the contribution from the susy breaking sector as a function of the scale @xmath196 .",
    "it evaluates as _ mess(e)=\\ {    cl 0 & e < m_y + 2 & m_ye < m _",

    "if we assume the qcd gauge coupling @xmath197 at @xmath198 we find a landau pole in the visible sector at @xmath199 this is large enough to avoid any landau pole problems up to a gut scale of @xmath191 for any high scale is actually quite interesting .",
    "we would then have the landau pole of the visible sector coinciding with both the landau pole in the susy breaking sector and the gut scale .",
    "this would give no shortage of strong dynamical effects to generate the susy breaking terms .",
    "of course , reaching a landau pole in the susy breaking sector suggests we should actually be working in the electric theory instead , so this analysis is not fully reliable . ]",
    "for @xmath171 larger still the landau pole is moved further and further above the gut scale .",
    "note that when @xmath171 approaches the planck mass this model exhibits the gauge - gravity hybrid behaviour discussed in @xcite ( with the gravitational contribution possibly generating a @xmath200 parameter of order the weak scale ) .",
    "in this paper we have proposed an alternative method for stabilising the uplifted vacua of sqcd . by restricting the magnetic gauge group to @xmath0",
    "we can stabilise all pseudomoduli with a baryon deformation to the superpotential .",
    "the baryon deformation appears as a mass term in the magnetic superpotential so stabilises the pseudomoduli via the coleman - weinberg potential .",
    "there remain tachyonic directions elsewhere in the pseudomoduli space so the model is able to produce gaugino masses comparable to sfermion masses when implicated in a direct mediation scenario .",
    "the method is theoretically economical and all relevant quantities can be calculated and understood by simple , analytical expressions . in addition , there are some strong phenomenological motivations for using this kind of model as a susy breaking sector .",
    "the smallness of the gauge group and the emergent mass hierarchy in the susy breaking sector means there is no landau pole problem .",
    "the theory can be described by only two fundamental scales : the weak scale of @xmath185 and some high scale @xmath190 , which could easily be taken to be the gut scale or the planck scale and are understood through considerations of the uv theory .",
    "the latter case approaches the gauge - gravity hybrid behaviour discussed in @xcite .",
    "the deformations required to couple the susy breaking to the visible sector can be motivated by symmetry arguments if we presume the theory to possess an @xmath2-symmetry ( which is broken explicitly by the same term responsible for susy breaking ) and allow single trace operators of up to dimension six in the electric theory . furthermore , the model predicts an effective number of messengers of precisely @xmath1 and the existence of several new particles around @xmath189 .",
    "these particles would couple to the visible sector through standard model gauge interactions so could be seen at the lhc .    as well as the direct mediation scenario considered in depth here ,",
    "other novel possibilities exist for this model .",
    "the vacuum discussed in  [ sec : bd ] preserves an unbroken flavour group @xmath83 which , for @xmath164 , could be identified with the visible sector gauge group .",
