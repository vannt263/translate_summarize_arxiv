    "we also conclude that to a good approximation , we can use only two parameters , @xmath433 and @xmath434 , to characterize the qualitative changes in transport at different strengths of disorder in different dimensions .",
    "we find that although fluctuations in @xmath121 at strong disorder are large ( non self - averaging ) , the effect of these fluctuations on @xmath9 is negligible .",
    "more importantly , we do not have an independent way to estimate the mean free path to obtain @xmath435 , but all qualitative features of the entire distribution @xmath9 is obtained correctly once an effective @xmath5 is used as a free parameter .",
    "we also find how these parameters depend on disorder and show their unambiguous dependence on the localization length .",
    "this is important since it indicates that the introduction of new parameters does not necessarily invalidate the single parameter scaling theory of localization .",
    "we have also shown that the matrix @xmath1 contains information about the anderson transition .",
    "the scaling of the parameters @xmath115 or @xmath6 clearly identifies the critical point which agrees with numerical results .",

    ", we show how one can go from a q1d ( @xmath46 ) to a truly 3d ( @xmath438 ) system in the insulating regime , which clearly shows the difference between a q1d and a 3d insulator .",
    "we then use the model to obtain the full distribution @xmath0 which agrees qualitatively with numerical results .",
    "it is indeed remarkable that even though the generalized dmpk equation ( [ gendmpk ] ) neglects fluctuations in @xmath53 and the model eq .",
    "( 19 ) neglects the index dependence of @xmath54 , the theory still captures all the essential features of length , disorder as well as dimensionality dependence of the entire conductance distribution and provides in particular a simple understanding of the 3d distribution at strong disorder , which is qualitatively different from a log - normal distribution in q1d . at the same time , our numerical studies suggest that having an independent estimate of the mean free path could provide a more quantitative description of the conductance distribution in 3d at all disorder .",

    "_ systems of length @xmath439 .",
    "it is this length - induced insulating behavior that is described by the dmpk equation .",
    "this is different from localization in 3d which occurs at _ strong _ disorder , where @xmath47 is much less than both @xmath11 and @xmath45 .",
    "this difference is clearly reflected in the matrix @xmath1 , where table i summarizes how the scale dependence of @xmath122 and @xmath6 depend on disorder in 3d .",
    "in contrast , @xmath1 in q1d is independent of disorder .",
    "our model recovers all the peculiarities of the 3d localized regime : we found that the distribution @xmath9 is narrower than in q1d and possesses non - zero skewness .",
    "although we concentrated on 3d systems , general considerations about the properties of the matrix @xmath1 in the insulating regime should be valid in any dimension @xmath440 .",
    "in particular , the assumption that @xmath122 is a nonzero @xmath45-independent constant in the localized regime is correct independent of dimensionality .",
    "therefore , we expect that our theory of the insulating regime is valid for any @xmath441 .",
    "consequently , the distribution @xmath9 is not gaussian in the localized regime in any @xmath441 , although the nature of the deviation from the gaussian form might be dimensionality dependent .",
