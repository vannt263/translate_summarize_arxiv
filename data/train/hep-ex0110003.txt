    "at tree level , the electroweak sector of the standard model is completely determined by three parameters , which are the gauge couplings to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 fields , and the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field .",
    "experimentally , then , it only requires three precision measurements to completely describe the theory , and all other parameters of the theory can then be calculated .",
    "the three most precise measurements available are the electromagnetic coupling @xmath2 which is very well known from electron @xmath3 experiments , the fermi coupling @xmath4 which is measured with the muon lifetime , and the mass of the z boson @xmath5 measured at lep .",
    "measurements of other electroweak parameters , most notably the mass of the w boson and the weak mixing angle , can then be used to directly test the predictions of the theory .    due to the presence of higher - order radiative corrections ,",
    "the simple tree - level predictions of the standard model are modified , predominantly through loop corrections , such that additional parameters are needed to fully describe the theory .",
    "the mass of the w boson , for example is predicted to be @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "these radiative corrections can either be seen as an annoying complication of the model or as an opportunity to gain indirect knowledge of otherwise unknown parameters like the higgs mass .    studying the properties of the w boson",
    "has been facilitated in the last decade by the direct production of large numbers of w bosons at lep and the tevatron .",
    "the lep collider at cern is an @xmath8  collider which was operated at the z pole from 1990  1995 ( ) , and above the w boson pair - production threshold during the period 1996  2000 ( ) .",
    "the process @xmath9  can be identified with high efficiency in all decay modes of the w boson , and with a cross section of around 17  pb at 200 gev , the four lep collaborations ( aleph , delphi , l3 , and opal ) collected a total sample of around 35,000 w pairs in the 2.7  fb of data recorded .    the tevatron collider at fermilab is a @xmath10  collider which ran at 1.8 tev during 1992  1995 ( ) , delivering colliding beams to the d0 and cdf collaborations . in hadronic collisions ,",
    "w bosons are identified in the leptonic decay modes , with high @xmath11  lepton triggers providing samples of  and  decays . with a very large production rate of @xmath12  nb ,",
    "the  total w sample exceeded 200,000 events . starting in 2001",
    ", an upgraded tevatron will begin , which is expected to deliver 2 @xmath13  at 2  tev by 2003 ( ) , and possibly up to 30 @xmath13  by the end of the decade .    since the tevatron has not been taking data for over five years ,",
    "most of the recent results in w physics have come from the lep collaborations , and these will be highlighted in this paper .",
    "where appropriate , the sensitivity of the tevatron experiments after data taken during the  period will also be noted . unless otherwise specified , all results are preliminary .",
    "in this paper , @xmath14  events produced in @xmath8  collisions are defined in terms of the  class of production diagrams shown in figure  [ fig : cc03 ] following the notation of the lep collaborations@xcite .",
    "these amplitudes provide a natural definition of resonant w - pair production , even though other non-  diagrams contribute to the same four - fermion final states . in order to correctly account for the additional non-  amplitudes present in the production process , the lep collaborations use monte carlo generators based on complete four - fermion calculations@xcite .",
    "the difference in production rate between purely  diagrams and the complete four - fermion matrix elements is typically less than 5% depending upon the final state involved .    in the standard model , @xmath14",
    "events are expected to decay into fully leptonic ( @xmath15 ) , semi - leptonic ( @xmath16 ) , or fully hadronic ( @xmath17 ) final states with predicted branching fractions of 10.6% , 43.9% , and 45.6% respectively@xcite",
    ". the lep collaborations use separate selections to identify these three main topologies , and the @xmath15  and @xmath16  events are further classified according to the observed lepton type . in total , @xmath14  candidate events are selected in one of ten possible final states @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 . due to the clean environment of @xmath8  collisions ,",
    "all decay modes of the @xmath14  events can be reconstructed with good efficiency and modest backgrounds as shown in table  [ tab : wwsel ] .    0.1 in    ._@xmath9  selection summary .",
    "_ [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : lepsyst ]    the most important uncertainties for the lep w mass measurement are related to the modelling of the detector response , modelling the hadronization of quarks into jets , understanding the lep beam energy , and the final state interactions mentioned before . to limit the uncertainty from detector modelling ,",
    "the lep collider was run from time to time throughout each running year at the @xmath21  resonance to take large samples of @xmath22  and @xmath23events .",
    "these samples , as well as similar samples at high energy , are then used to study the detector response to leptons and jets and limit the deficiencies in the detector models .",
    "hadronization uncertainties are estimated by comparing different monte carlo implementations of the hadronization process , including @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "knowledge of the lep beam energy is critically important as it sets the overall energy scale for the w mass measurement , and any uncertainty in is completely correlated between all four lep collaborations .",
    "more detailed information about the beam energy measurement at can be found elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the broad issue of final state interactions ( fsi ) involves any effect in the @xmath17  channel by which the decay products of the two w bosons interact with each other . since standard monte carlo models assume that these two systems decay independently , these interactions can exchange momentum between the two w systems and distort the final w lineshape . two specific phenomena which are known to exist , but with rather uncertain strengths , are color reconnection ( cr ) and bose",
    " einstein correlations ( bec ) .",
    "color reconnection involves the rearrangement of the color strings in the hadronizing system , essentially gluon exchange , in the non - perturbative phase of the hadronization process .",
    "only a few models exist to describe this process , and these tend to have limited predictive power@xcite .",
    "einstein correlations between identical particles are well established in hadronic @xmath21  decays at .",
    "since the w boson decay length ( 0.1  fm ) is significantly shorter than the hadronization scale ( 1  fm ) , it is entirely plausible that there can be additional be effects between particles originating from different w bosons in @xmath17  events .",
    "because of the way monte carlo generators operate , however , modelling this purely quantum mechanical effect is extremely difficult , and imperfect knowledge of the space - time evolution of the hadronizing system adds to the difficulty@xcite .",
    "overall , the strategy of the lep experiments to address these difficult questions is to use the various models as a guide for the types of effects which can be expected , but to constrain the allowed magnitude of any fsi effect using the data directly .",
    "one way to broadly check that large fsi effects are not present is to compare the w mass measured in the @xmath17  channel to that measured in the @xmath16  channel .",
    "including all uncertainties with their correlations aside from those related to fsi directly , the lep collaborations find @xmath24 which is consistent with no final state interactions .",
    "color reconnection effects tend to enhance or suppress particle production in the regions between the main jets .",
    "currently , all four lep collaborations are pursuing analyses aimed at measuring the particle flow distribution in @xmath17final states with the ultimate aim of discriminating between various cr models . with all four lep experiments combined ,",
    "it is likely that the uncertainty from cr can be significantly reduced from its current values .",
    "the analysis of bec effects is in a more advanced stage .",
    "all four lep collaborations are currently using an event mixing method where data from two semi - leptonic @xmath16events are mixed ( without the lepton ) and compared to data from genuine @xmath17  events . in a rigorously model ",
    "independent test , these two samples should look identical if there is no bec present between the decay products of different w bosons . in order to limit the possible size of the effect allowed , however",
    ", a similar analysis must be performed on different monte carlo models of bec .",
    "currently , all four lep collaborations see no evidence for inter - w bec effects at the limits of their statistical power to observe them . by combining these results and evaluating a range of bec models , the systematic uncertainty from this source",
    "should also be reduced for the final lep results .",
    "the current world knowledge of the w mass from and the tevatron are shown in figure  [ fig : mwgw ] , along with the indirect value inferred from other precision electroweak measurements .",
    "while the current world average is dominated by , with the data expected at the tevatron during , the combined error on direct w mass measurements should approach 20 mev by around 2006 .",
    "the direct reconstruction method employed at , as well as the transverse mass method employed at the tevatron , are sensitive to the w width as well as the w mass . in the standard mass analyses , the width is typically fixed to the standard model expectation for a given mass value , but it can equally well be allowed to be a second free parameter in the fits .",
    "the direct measurements of the w boson width are shown in figure  [ fig : mwgw ] along with the indirect width evaluation mentioned earlier and the standard model expectation .",
    "it should be noted that not all lep data has been analyzed , and d0 has yet to produce a result for the direct width measurement . with these improvements",
    ", the precision on the direct width measurements should actually be competitive with the indirect width from the tevatron .",
    "the combined electroweak data is often summarized as shown in figure  [ fig : worldew ] .",
    "the first plot in this figure shows @xmath25  vs. @xmath26  both for the direct measurements , the indirect electroweak data , and the standard model prediction as a function of the higgs mass .",
    "it is clear that a light higgs is preferred by the data , and the direct measurements are starting to stray into a region more favorable for supersymmetric theories .",
    "it can also be seen from this plot that significant improvements in the uncertainty on @xmath25  will not be very useful if they are not accompanied by comparable improvements in @xmath26 .",
    "another way of looking at this is in terms of the sensitivity toward the remaining unknown parameter in the standard model , the higgs mass .",
    "several groups have produced simple parameterized versions of the functional relationships predicted by the standard model between derived quantities like @xmath25  or @xmath27and the input parameters like @xmath26  and @xmath28@xcite . using these tools",
    ", it can be shown that after , the constraint on the higgs mass arising from the measurement of the w mass is improved in equal parts by reducing the uncertainty on @xmath25 , but also by reducing the uncertainty on @xmath26which is necessary to calculate the standard model prediction .",
    "it can also be seen that the constraint arising from the w mass will match the precision of that coming from @xmath27 , and with greatly reduced sensitivity to the running of the fine structure constant@xcite .    in summary , the past five years have seen some remarkable improvements in the knowledge of the w boson properties from the lep collaborations . with around 650  @xmath29  recorded per experiment , world s best measurements of the w boson branching fractions , gauge couplings , and mass",
    "have been performed .",
    "the next five years will see measurements of similar precision performed at the tevatron with the advent of .",
    "the combined electroweak data continues to provide the most stringent constraint for any model of new physics , and improving this knowledge is crucial step to the eventual goal of fully understanding the process of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the author would like to thank the organizers for the kind invitation to participate in this conference , as well as a warm personal thanks to the local organizing committee for their efforts to make this event pleasant for everybody .",
    "the author would also like to thank the members of the aleph , delphi , l3 , opal , cdf , and d0 collaborations for their assistance in preparing this paper .",
