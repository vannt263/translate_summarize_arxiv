    "the study of topological systems originated in the setting of electronic condensed matter  @xcite . in these systems , the energy bands can be characterized by nontrivial topological invariants , which are robust under small perturbations .",
    "importantly , these invariants can have many physical consequences such as quantized bulk responses and topologically protected edge physics , as has been experimentally investigated in a wide range of solid - state materials  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the introduction of topological concepts into photonics  @xcite has opened up many exciting avenues of research . much of this activity has been focused on the experimental observation of topologically protected edge states in systems ranging from gyromagnetic photonic crystals in the microwave domain  @xcite , to floquet topological insulators based on arrays of coupled waveguides  @xcite , to arrays of ring resonators in integrated silicon photonics  @xcite , and to engineered bianisotropic metamaterials  @xcite . in all these works ,",
    "spatially periodic structures act as lattices for light which , in combination with an engineered synthetic gauge field , lead to two - dimensional ( 2d ) photonic energy bands that can be characterized by a single topological invariant - the first chern number .",
    "going beyond two dimensions , the first experimental works on three - dimensional ( 3d ) lattices have recently unveiled peculiar and intriguing topological features in their photonic band dispersion , such as weyl points  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , much interest has also been devoted to new protocols to measure the topological invariants in the bulk of the system as well as at its edges  @xcite .    at the same time as this progress in photonics ,",
    "the community of ultracold atomic gases has also been very active in the study of topological physics . to this end",
    ", artificial gauge fields were generated by dressing atomic lattices with suitable combinations of magnetic and optical fields  @xcite , such that neutral atoms behave like electrons under strong magnetic fields with measurable bulk ( topological ) responses  @xcite .",
    "very recently , exciting new perspectives have arisen from the combination of such engineered gauge fields with a synthetic dimension , where internal atomic degrees of freedom are exploited as an additional lattice dimension , as has been theoretically proposed  @xcite and quickly experimentally realized in a 1d spatial geometry that ends up behaving as a 2d topological system  @xcite .",
    "these advances have inspired us in a previous work to propose a method for the realization of 4d topological systems using atoms  @xcite .",
    "indeed , such a conceptual shift towards synthetic dimensions holds great promise also in optics , as suggested by other recent proposals  @xcite .    in this paper , we describe how the idea of a synthetic dimension can be exploited in an integrated photonics architecture , leading to engineered gauge fields and nontrivial band topologies in systems with one to three spatial dimensions .",
    "our proposal relies on a ring - resonator array infrastructure where the different modes of each resonator act as the synthetic dimension .",
    "coupling between different resonator modes is produced through an external time - dependent modulation of the dielectric properties of each cavity at a frequency equal to ( or a multiple of ) the free - spectral range .",
    "additionally , this modulation can be tailored spatially such that each resonator experiences different ( complex ) coupling matrix elements ; this can be used for engineering gauge fields and nontrivial band topologies .",
    "importantly , our proposal is realizable with state - of - the - art silicon photonics technology , while the required modulation scheme can be implemented in an all - optical way .",
    "this allows one to control the synthetic gauge field with great flexibility and in a quickly reconfigurable way , just by changing the geometry of the strong modulating field .",
    "our scheme has important implications : ( i ) 1d chains of resonators coupled in this way behave as 2d topological systems with propagating edge states that may be exploited to provide on - chip optical isolation ; and ( ii ) photonic topological lattice models can be constructed in dimensions higher than three dimensions .",
    "this may have dramatic applications in integrated photonic circuits with higher connectivity , where the mode index can be naturally associated with the different frequency channels of an optical signal .      in sec .",

    "[ sec : conclu ] , we discuss future perspectives offered by the introduction of synthetic dimensions into integrated photonics .",
    "in this section , we detail how the different modes of a silicon ring resonator can be treated as a discrete set of lattice sites along an additional synthetic dimension . after introducing this idea for a single resonator",
    ", we discuss how this approach can be naturally extended to an array of resonators to build effective higher - dimensional photonic lattices .",
    "we consider a single ring - resonator with radius @xmath0 and effective mode index @xmath1 .",
    "each optical mode is labeled by an integer @xmath2 corresponding to the angular momentum of the mode around the ring .",
    "the corresponding mode frequencies @xmath3 are ( almost ) equispaced with a free spectral range @xmath4 , @xmath5 where the contribution of the frequency dispersion @xmath6 , arising both from the refractive index dispersion of the cavity material and from the confinement geometry , is typically a small perturbation for modes sufficiently close to the reference mode @xmath7 .",
    "the key idea of our proposal is to view the different resonator modes as a discrete set of lattice sites along a synthetic dimension , @xmath2 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : overview](a ) . hopping processes along the synthetic dimension are obtained by linearly coupling modes with different values of @xmath2 through a suitable time - dependent modulation of the dielectric properties of the resonator .",
    "we propose to implement the time - dependent modulation using the material nonlinearity through the application of external light fields ; a detailed discussion of this scheme is given in appendix  [ sec : implementation ] .",

    "we also introduce the hopping unit @xmath12 , which is set by the details of the scheme used to realize the modulation of the dielectric properties of the resonator , as will be discussed in appendix  [ sec : implementation ] .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : overview](a ) , the inter - mode coupling is depicted between modes that are adjacent in frequency , corresponding to @xmath13 .",

    "spatial variation of the dielectric modulation of each resonator makes the complex hopping amplitude @xmath15 spatially dependent .",
    "we can design this modulation so that the phase , @xmath16 , obtained by a photon hopping around a plaquette in the synthetic 2d lattice ( shaded in blue ) is uniform across the lattice .",

    "this shows how a time - dependent modulation can effect a static inter - mode coupling in a silicon ring resonator in the rotating frame .",
    "notably , from this result , it is justified to interpret the mode index @xmath2 as indexing an additional synthetic dimension . in the following ,",
    "we show how this hamiltonian can be combined with other building blocks to create topological lattices in integrated photonics .",
    "the advantage of harnessing the internal - mode structure of a ring resonator becomes apparent when coupling several resonators spatially .",
    "consider extending this approach to a @xmath33-dimensional cubic lattice of multimode ring resonators .",
    "due to the additional motion along the synthetic dimension , light passing through the lattice experiences a @xmath34-dimensional lattice in which the lattice - site coordinates are given by the composite vector @xmath35 . for closely spaced resonators , the overlap of optical modes of neighboring resonators provides a spatial tunneling process describable within the standard tight - binding hamiltonian , @xmath36 where the sum over @xmath37 runs over all resonator positions , @xmath38 is the lattice unit vector in the real - space @xmath39 direction ( e.g. , @xmath40 for a @xmath41 lattice ) , and @xmath42 is the corresponding hopping amplitude that quickly decreases with the inter - resonator distance . notably , energy conservation guarantees that the tunnel coupling is effective only between modes with the same @xmath2 . as introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : single ] , inducing a time - dependent modulation of the dielectric properties generates a coupling along the @xmath2 direction within each resonator .",

    "each cavity mode @xmath53 oscillates , in the non - rotating frame , at a frequency @xmath54 in the steady state .",
    "the different supermodes of the many - resonator system can be selectively addressed by varying the position and frequency of the driving field  @xcite .",

    "in this section , we now place our proposal in the context of other photonics advances , discussing briefly in turn previous works on synthetic dimensions , on engineered gauge fields and topological edge states in ring - resonator arrays , and on optical isolation in integrated photonics .",
    "first , there have been two previous proposals that describe how a synthetic dimension may be introduced into a photonics system  @xcite . in the former  @xcite",
    ", the photon and phonon degrees of freedom of optomechanical crystals were utilized giving rise to only two sites in the synthetic dimension , while in the latter  @xcite , the orbital angular momentum degrees of freedom of optical cavities was exploited as the synthetic dimension with the hopping being provided by spatial light modulators .",
    "compared to these works , our scheme is designed for integrated photonics , and is well suited to applications on chip .",
    "we note that while ref .",
    "@xcite also studied topological edge states in a 1d array of cavities , the lack of a hard edge in the synthetic dimension meant that light only propagated along the frequency direction .",
    "we have instead shown that losses can be used to engineer and control topological edge states along the spatial direction , so that this device could be used as a topological optical isolator .",
    "we also emphasise that our proposal allows us to build topological lattice models in dimensions higher than 3d , which may have dramatic applications in integrated photonic circuits with higher connectivity .",
    "second , our scheme for studying the 2d harper - hofstadter model in a 1d chain of multimode resonators can be compared to previous works that implement the model in 2d silicon ring - resonator arrays . in a 2d resonator array ,",
    "the complex peierls phase factor is engineered into the spatial coupling between different resonators , for example , using non - resonant link resonators  @xcite ( as described also for our 3d resonator lattice in sec .",
    "[ sec:4d ] ) .",
    "the use of a synthetic dimension has two key advantages over this experiment ; first , the gauge field can be controlled externally through the phase of the dielectric modulation that induces the inter - mode coupling , whereas with link resonators , the gauge field is almost fixed at the time of fabrication with a limited tuning ability offered by a selective local heating of the link resonators  @xcite .",
    "second , the modulation coupling different modes explicitly breaks time - reversal symmetry . using link resonators , conversely",
    ", this symmetry is not broken as modes with opposite circulation can be viewed as two pseudo - spin experiencing gauge fields of opposite sign .",
    "indeed , in the experiment  @xcite , this meant that the one - way propagation of light was not topologically protected , but could be scattered by pseudo - spin - flipping impurities , such as surface roughness .",
    "in a similar direction , there has also been a theoretical proposal for engineering the 2d harper - hofstadter model in a spatially 2d photonic lattice by modulating the coupling constants between resonators harmonically in time to induce the appropriate peierls phase factors  @xcite .",
    "while this system shares the advantage of tunability and robustness with our approach , it requires a large real 2d lattice to achieve efficient optical isolation . in our proposal ,",
    "the left - moving and right - moving states are separated in frequency , and so optical isolation could be realized in a much smaller 1d photonic device .    finally , it is instructive to compare our proposal for an optical isolator in sec .",
    "[ sec:2d ] to previous works on optical isolation in integrated photonics .",
    "recently , there have been many advances in this field using , for example , magneto - optical elements  @xcite , non - linear materials  @xcite or spatiotemporal modulation  @xcite . of these ,",
    "our set - up is most closely related to those with spatiotemporal modulation , which are also perhaps the most feasible schemes for applications as magneto - optical elements can be difficult to integrate on - chip  @xcite , while non - linear isolators can be limited , for instance , by dynamic reciprocity  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "spatiotemporal modulations are used to induce indirect interband photonic transitions , for example , in a waveguide on a silicon chip  @xcite . by efficiently coupling two photonic modes moving in one direction , but",
    "not coupling the modes moving in the opposite direction , such devices break reciprocity and can be used for optical isolation . in a recent experiment ,",
    "such a modulation was also applied with different phases at two spatially separated points along a waveguide  @xcite ; this is conceptually connected to a single plaquette of our synthetic lattice in an engineered magnetic field . by coupling many modes and many ring resonators ,",
    "our proposal extends such schemes to also exploit the topological robustness of edge states and allows for unidirectional propagation along arbitrary directions in the higher - dimensional space spanned by the physical and synthetic dimensions .",
    "this is of utmost interest if one wishes to combine spatial propagation and isolation with a controlled frequency conversion between different channels .",
    "in this paper we have shown how the many - mode nature of ring resonators can be exploited as a synthetic dimension to realize topological photonic lattices on an integrated photonics platform compatible with state - of - the - art silicon photonics technology .",
    "we have illustrated our proposal with two important examples , demonstrating its utility and power .",
    "we first showed that the 2d quantum hall effect and its associated topological edge states can be realized using a 1d chain of multimode resonators , which shows a potential to be used as an integrated optical isolator .",
    "second , we demonstrated how the signatures of the 4d quantum hall effect could be studied in a 3d lattice of resonators .",
    "in addition to being a powerful workhorse for studies of fundamental topological effects in high dimensions , our proposal opens the way towards the realization of photonic circuits with richer connectivities .",
    "the synthetic dimension is naturally associated with the different frequency channels of an optical signal , and the topological protection produced by the synthetic gauge field can be exploited to obtain robust unidirectional propagation along specific desired directions in the higher - dimensional space spanned by the physical and synthetic dimensions .",
    "a particularly interesting direction of future research is to explore edge states in four dimensions .",
    "the bulk - boundary correspondence tells us that topologically nontrivial bands imply the appearance of topological edge states .",
    "the edge of a four - dimensional system should be three - dimensional , with properties that are little known but may lead to interesting applications in higher - dimensional photonic circuits .    in the longer run , one may anticipate that inclusion of strong nonlinearities in such cavity arrays could lead to strongly correlated quantum states of photons that generalize fractional quantum hall states  @xcite to high dimensions .",
    "in addition to the experimental difficulty of realizing an efficient photon blockade  @xcite in a multi - resonator and multi - frequency integrated photonics device , this ambitious program raises the further theoretical challenge of finding strategies to obtain fractional quantum hall states when interactions along the synthetic dimension are non - local and long - ranged , as recently discussed in the cold - atom context in  @xcite .    _ note added . _",
