    "two - level algorithm allowed us to reach accuracy @xmath57 for the lattice @xmath53 and @xmath58 for the lattice @xmath55 at point @xmath59 .",
    "for the other points the accuracy is much better .     as a function of euclidean time @xmath26 measured at lattices @xmath53 and @xmath55 ]    visually the set of values of the correlation functions measured at different lattices lies on one curve .",
    "the values for the correlation functions measured at close points in the region @xmath61 are very close to each other .",
    "note also that the fit parameters ( see below ) of both correlation functions are very close to each other .",
    "these facts allow us to expect that finite lattice size and finite volume effects are not very important in our calculation .",
    "unfortunately the accuracy of our results and number of points where the correlation function ( [ correlator ] ) was measured do not allow us to use maximal entropy method to determine the spectral function @xmath14 .",
    "for this reason we use physically motivated ansatz for the spectral function with unknown parameters which will be determined through the fitting procedure .",
    "probably the simplest formula for the spectral function inspired by qcd sum rules@xcite can be built if we join hydrodynamical behaviour at small frequencies with asymptotic freedom at large frequencies is measured in physical units . ]",
    "@xmath62 in last formula @xmath63 is a tree level lattice expression for the spectral function calculated for the correlation function @xmath64 with clover discretization of the tensor @xmath65 at lattice with fixed @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "although the calculation of the @xmath63 can be easily performed using formulas from paper @xcite , the resulting expression is very cumbersome .",
    "for this reason instead of the explicit expression for the @xmath68 , in fig.[fig : rholat ] we plot the ratio @xmath69 for the lattice @xmath70 .     as a function of @xmath71    the fit of the lattice data ( @xmath72 ) with the formula ( [ spectr_corr ] ) with the spectral function ( [ rho1 ] ) gives @xmath73 for the lattice @xmath53 and @xmath74 for the lattice @xmath55 .",
    "it is seen that ansatz ( [ rho1 ] ) for the spectral function fits the lattice data very well and the parameters of the fit for different lattices are in a reasonable agreement with each other .",
    "the resulting shear viscosity is @xmath75 for the lattice @xmath53 and @xmath76 for the lattice @xmath55 . in fig.[figrho12 ] we plot the spectral function @xmath77 as a function @xmath23 for the lattice @xmath70 .",
    "now few comments are in order    * in formula ( [ rho1 ] ) we used @xmath63 instead of the continuum tree - level expression for the @xmath14 ( see formula ( [ rho_tree_level ] ) ) .",
    "we believe that this allows us to take into account discretization uncertainty and asymptotic freedom contribution more carefully .",
    "if one puts the continuum tree - level expression to formula ( [ rho1 ] ) , the @xmath78 of the fits will be considerably enhanced : @xmath79 for the lattice @xmath53 and @xmath80 for the lattice @xmath55 .",
    "* as was noted above the asymptotic behaviour of the spectral function at large @xmath23 is fixed @xmath81 . however , the coefficient in front of the @xmath82behaviour is modified by higher order radiative corrections ( see formula ( [ rho_nlo ] ) ) . in order to take this effect into account in formula ( [ rho1 ] ) we introduced factor @xmath83 . at this point",
    "our ansatz deviates from that used in papers @xcite .",
    "if we take @xmath84 , the ansatz ( [ rho1 ] ) will not be able to describe our data ( @xmath85 for both lattices ) . * the values of the fit parameters are physically well motivated .",
    "for instance , the value of the parameter @xmath83 is smaller than unity , what agrees with the next - to - leading order result ( [ rho_nlo ] ) .",
    "the value of the strong coupling constant at the threshold parameter @xmath86 ( @xmath87 gev in physical units ) is @xmath88 .",
    "this allows us to expect that perturbative expression for the spectral function is applicable for @xmath89 .",
    "low frequency part of the spectral function ( [ rho1 ] ) is given by the first - order hydrodynamic expression @xmath90 .",
    "comparison of the spectral functions of the energy - momentum tensor correlation functions obtained in n = 4 sym @xcite and the first - order hydrodynamic expressions allows us to expect that this approximation works well up to @xmath91 gev@xcite . from the other side high frequency",
    "perturbative expression for the spectral function is fixed very accurately and it works well for @xmath92 gev .",
    "the form of the spectral function in the region @xmath93 is not clear .",
    "formula ( [ rho1 ] ) continues the first - order hydrodynamic expression to the region @xmath93 ( see fig .",
    "[ figrho12 ] ) . as the result",
    "there is rather large discontinuity in the spectral function ( [ rho1 ] ) at point @xmath86 which for the lattice @xmath94 is @xmath95 .",
    "the last fact allows us to state that the spectral function in form ( [ rho1 ] ) underestimates real spectral function in the region @xmath93 and as a result the value of shear viscosity obtained in this fit is larger than its real value .     and @xmath96 as the function of @xmath97 for the lattice @xmath70 . ]",
    "as was noted a serious drawback of the spectral function @xmath14 is its discontinuity at point @xmath98 . in order to solve this problem",
    "we propose another form of the spectral function which preserves basic ideas of the spectral function ( [ rho1 ] ) and takes into account the property @xmath99 @xmath100    the fit of the lattice data ( @xmath72 ) by the formula ( [ spectr_corr ] ) with the spectral function ( [ rho2 ] ) gives @xmath101 for the lattice @xmath53 and @xmath102 for the lattice @xmath55 .",
    "it is seen that ansatz ( [ rho2 ] ) for the spectral function fits the lattice data very well and parameters from different lattices are in a reasonable agreement with each other .",
    "the resulting shear viscosity is @xmath103 for the lattice @xmath53 and @xmath104 for the lattice @xmath55 . in fig.[figrho12 ] we plot the spectral function @xmath96 as a function @xmath23 for the lattice @xmath70 .",
    "notice that the function ( [ rho2 ] ) is larger than ( [ rho1 ] ) in the region @xmath93 , as the result the value of the of shear viscosity becomes smaller . note also that the value of shear viscosity obtained at the lattice @xmath53 is very close to the n = 4 sym prediction @xmath105 .    in order to investigate the systematic errors , caused by the usage of the ansatz ( 8),(9 ) we studied other fit functions . instead of the @xmath106 in formula ( [ rho2 ] ) one can use , for example , any power of this function @xmath107 or linear combination @xmath108 .",
    "any function can be approximated by this linear approximation with good accuracy .",
    "] we found , that in these cases the fits are also good and the resulting viscosities are greater than that for the spectral function ( [ rho2 ] ) and smaller than that for the spectral function ( [ rho1 ] ) .",
    "as the result of this paper we take the value @xmath109 the central value is the average between the values of shear viscosity obtained with the spectral functions in the form ( [ rho1 ] ) and ( [ rho2 ] ) from the fit of lattice data measured at the lattice @xmath53 .",
    "the first uncertainty is due to the fitting procedure which is typically @xmath110 .",
    "the second uncertainty is due to the unknown model of the spectral function . we estimated this uncertainty assuming that the central value of shear viscosity can vary between central values of the fits ( [ rho2 ] ) and ( [ rho1 ] )",
    "actually there are a lot of different sources of uncertainties of our result but they are much smaller than statistical and spectral function model uncertainties .",
    "in this paper we studied the energy - momentum tensor correlation function @xmath111 for @xmath1-gluodynamics using lattice simulation of qcd .",
    "we carried out the measurements of this correlation function at lattices @xmath53 with @xmath54 and @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "both lattices correspond to deconfinement phase with the temperature @xmath2 but different physical volumes and lattice spacings . in order to enhance the accuracy of the calculation we used two - level algorithm which allowed us to reach accuracy @xmath57 for the lattice @xmath53 and @xmath58 for the lattice @xmath55 at point @xmath112 . for",
    "the other points the accuracy is much better .    using lattice data for the correlation function we tried to study the spectral function .",
    "it was shown that physically motivated anzatz which joins the first - order hydrodynamical behaviour at small frequencies with asymptotic freedom at large frequencies fits our data very well for both lattices .",
    "we also studied other forms of the spectral functions which interpolate between hydrodynamics and asymptotic freedom .",
    "the results of the study of spectral functions allowed us to estimate the ratio of shear viscosity to the entropy density @xmath3 .",
    "this value is in agreement with our previous finding @xmath113 @xcite obtained at small lattice with the estimation of statistical uncertainty only .",
    "note also that within the uncertainty of the calculation the value obtained in this paper agrees with the value measured in @xmath8-gluodynamics : @xmath114 measured at temperature @xmath115@xcite .",
    "the values of the ratio @xmath9 for the @xmath1 and @xmath8-gluodynamics are very close to the prediction of the n = 4 sym theory at strong coupling : @xmath6 .",
    "so one can state that both theories belong to strongly correlated systems and probably the closeness of the ratio @xmath9 to the ratio in n = 4 sym theory is the property on non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "the simulations were performed at itep supercomputer . the work was supported by far eastern federal university , dynasty foundation , by rfbr grants 14 - 02 - 01185-a , 15 - 02 - 07596-a , 15 - 32 - 21117 by a grant of the president of the rf , md-3215.2014.2 , and by a grant of the fair - russia research center ."

    "<S> in particular , numerical simulations of the relativistic liquid showed @xcite that the upper limit on the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density is @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> preferred range for the ratio is @xmath5 , which is very close to the result of n = 4 super yang mills ( sym ) theory at strong coupling @xmath6@xcite . from these facts </S>",
    "<S> one can conclude that theoretical prediction of the ratio @xmath7 is a very interesting and important problem .    </S>",
    "<S> it is known that qgp is strongly interacting system and today there are no analytical approaches which allow to study such systems without additional assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason one of the main approaches which can be used to study the properties of qgp and which is based on the first principles is lattice simulation of qcd .    </S>",
    "<S> lattice simulation of qcd aimed at the calculation of shear viscosity of the @xmath8-gluodynamics was carried out in papers @xcite . despite rather large uncertainties one can state that the ratios @xmath9 obtained in papers @xcite are close to the n = 4 sym prediction @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of shear viscosity in qcd with dynamical quarks is still a challenging problem .    </S>",
    "<S> the closeness of the su(3)-gluodynamics ratio @xmath9 to the n = 4 sym prediction allows us to ask the question whether this property is the property of the su(3)-gluodynamics or it is common to all non - abelian gauge theories . to address this question in this paper we are going to perform the calculation of shear viscosity of @xmath1-gluodynamics within lattice simulation .    </S>",
    "<S> we have already performed the first measurement of shear viscosity of the @xmath1-gluodynamics in @xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we extend our investigation to larger lattice size and apply different method to determine numerical value of the ratio @xmath7 .      </S>",
    "<S> shear viscosity is related to the euclidean correlation function of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath11 ( here we omitted for simplicity trace anomaly ) : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the temperature of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation function ( [ correlator ] ) can be written in terms of the spectral function @xmath14 as follows @xmath15    the spectral function contains a lot of important information about the properties of medium . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , to find shear viscosity from spectral function one uses the kubo formula @xcite @xmath16 lattice calculation of shear viscosity can be divided into two parts . </S>",
    "<S> the first part is the measurement of the correlation function @xmath17 with sufficient accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> this part of the calculation requires large computational resources but for the gluodynamics the accuracy of the correlator can be dramatically improved with the help of the two - level algorithm @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second part is the determination of the spectral function @xmath14 from the correlation function @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the last part of the calculation is probably the most complicated , since one should determine continuous spectral function @xmath14 from integral equation ( [ spectr_corr ] ) for the set of @xmath18 values of the function @xmath17 measured in lattice simulation .    to approach the solution of the integral equation ( [ spectr_corr ] ) one should take into account the properties of the spectral function . </S>",
    "<S> important properties of the spectral function are positivity : @xmath19 and oddness : @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> it is also important to write the expression for the spectral function at the leading - order approximation in strong coupling constant @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 for the su(2)-gluodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> one also knows next - to - leading order expression for the spectral function at large @xmath23 @xcite @xmath24 it should be noted here that at large @xmath23 the spectral function scales as @xmath25 , what leads to a large perturbative contribution to the correlation function for all values of euclidean time @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> calculation shows that even at the @xmath27 the tree level contribution is @xmath28 of the total value of the correlation function . </S>",
    "<S> note also that large @xmath23 behaviour of the spectral function leads to a fast decrease of the correlation function @xmath29 for small @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason the signal / noise ratio for the @xmath17 is small at @xmath30 and lattice measurement of the correlation function at @xmath31 becomes computationally very expensive .    </S>",

    "<S> @xmath36 we use the clover discretization scheme : @xmath37 it causes no difficulties to build energy - momentum tensor having expression for the tensor @xmath36 .    to calculate shear viscosity one should measure the correlation function ( [ correlator ] ) . to carry out this measurement we use two - level algorithm described in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this algorithm significantly improves the speed of the calculations . </S>",
