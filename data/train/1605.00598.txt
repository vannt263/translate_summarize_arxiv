    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 , say that an edge @xmath177 and an edge @xmath178 are `` opposite each other '' if one of the following conditions holds :    1 .",
    "the two edges are on both boundaries and coincide ; 2 .",
    "the edges form the beginning of an island in that the edge preceding them is on both boundaries and @xmath179 are successive edges on the boundary of a region of @xmath168 ; 3 .",
    "@xmath180 is a successive part of the boundary of a region @xmath112 and @xmath181 is the label on an interior edge separating @xmath112 from another region .",
    "the main point is that if we choose a letter @xmath37 in @xmath2 and a letter @xmath182 in @xmath3 and suppose that they are the labels on edges which are opposite each other in @xmath168 , then is _ only one way _ to fill in the rest of the conjugacy diagram and we can calculate whether or not a valid conjugacy diagram with this initial condition exists in linear time .",
    "if we succeed in constructing a valid conjugacy diagram for one of the @xmath183 possible initial conditions , then @xmath2 and @xmath3 are conjugate , and if we can not construct a conjugacy diagram then they are not conjugate .",
    "it is also clear from the structure of conjugacy diagrams that    @xmath76    so a solution to the conjugacy problem for @xmath0 decides membership in @xmath53 . on the other hand ,",
    "given an oracle for the set @xmath53 we can calculate weakly cyclically @xmath19-reduced conjugates for any pair of elements and then apply the method above to decide conjugacy and the conjugacy problem for @xmath0 is turing equivalent to deciding membership in @xmath53 .    for the groups @xmath143 for the time hierarchy theorem",
    "it is clear that    @xmath184    so the conjugacy problem can not be calculated in time @xmath17 .",
    "the conjugating part of the defining relators has been chosen so that the only way that @xmath185 or @xmath186 or @xmath187 or their inverses can be subwords of the label on an interior edge in a reduced diagram is if they are matched against the corresponding generators of the other conjugating part of the same relator . and",
    "since the boundary labels of a conjugacy diagram are freely reduced , the entire conjugating parts must then be exactly matched and appear as the label on the interior edge . if all interior edges are so labelled , the diagram shows that a power of some @xmath165 is conjugacy to the same power of @xmath188 .",
    "if it is the case that for some region of the conjugacy diagram a conjugating part of the relator is not completely matched against its inverse , then some @xmath189 occurs on one of the boundaries and the padding allows us to calculate in linear time if this is indeed a correct part of a relator . in this case",
    "we can again see if one can construct a valid conjugacy diagram in quadratic time .",
    "so the algorithm in time @xmath132 for membership in @xmath130 solves the conjugacy problem for @xmath143 .    the remarks for the groups @xmath143 apply exactly to the groups @xmath16 for the half - conjugacy problem .",
    "the only hard case is when a power of @xmath190 is conjugate to the corresponding power of @xmath191 or to its inverse .",
    "the relators force one of the two possibilities to hold but deciding which one requires deciding membership in @xmath157 .",
    "so the conjugacy problem for these groups is solvable in time @xmath155 but not in time @xmath17 .",
    "we now want to construct a computably presented group @xmath0 with @xmath13-complete conjugacy problem while keeping the constraint that all individual conjugacy problems are decidable in quadratic time and that the conjugacy problem for the given presentation is strongly generically quadratic time . the previous results on imitating the time - hierarchy theorem and the half - conjugacy problem depended on using the free group unary notation since this notation gives enough padding in the conjugating parts of the relators to check the correctness of relators .",
    "of course , elements of a free group also have a unique _ normal form with exponents _ , where we write powers of generators as the name of the generator with a decimal exponent .",
    "syllable _ is such a power of a generator and we require that adjacent syllables are powers of distinct generators .",
    "for example , one element of the free group @xmath192is @xmath193 .",
    "the _ length _ of a normal form with exponents is the total number of symbols in the normal form .",
    "thus @xmath194 for the example just given .",
    "basic decision problems in free groups mainly retain their polynomial - time decidability in this notation .",
    "for example , gurevich and schupp @xcite show that the uniform membership problem for finitely generated subgroups of a free group remains in polynomial time when elements are written in exponent normal form .",
    "we need to use exponent normal form in order to have a coding of the satisfiability problem for boolean expressions where the coded length is proportional to the length of the standard coding of such expressions .    the problem _",
    "3-sat _ is the satisfiability problem for boolean expressions which are conjunctions of clauses , each of which contains exactly three literals .",
    "a literal is the symbol @xmath120 with positive decimal subscript , representing a variable , or its negation .",
    "for example , the expression @xmath195 is an instance of @xmath50-sat .",
    "a basic result of complexity theory is that @xmath50-sat is @xmath5-complete .",
    "variables may be repeated in a clause but we assume that a clause does not both a variable and its negation",
    ".    we will represent the clause @xmath196 as @xmath197 with the exponent negative if the variable is negated .",
    "we represent a conjunction of clauses by the concatenation of the representatives of the clauses .",
    "thus we represent the example of @xmath50-sat given above by @xmath198 so the length of our basic coding is even shorter than the standard coding of instances of @xmath50-sat .    in order to represent",
    "@xmath50-sat we need to code all its instances . to do this",
    "we put a `` short - lex '' well - ordering on @xmath199 as follows .",
    "the _ index _ of a triple @xmath200 is @xmath201 , the sum of the absolute values of the @xmath202 .",
    "we order triples first by index , and within the same index lexicographically but with positive values preceding negative ones .",
    "note that we consider only triples which do not contain @xmath69 since subscripts of variables are positive .",
    "we define an enumeration @xmath203 of all instances of @xmath50-sat as follows .",
    "we enumerate all pairs @xmath204 of positive integers in the usual way .",
    "when a pair @xmath204 is enumerated , we then enumerate all instances of @xmath50-sat where there are at most @xmath205 clauses and the maximum index of any clause is at most @xmath67 and the instance _ has not previously been enumerated_. the clauses in an instance are concatenated in the short - lex order defined above and we order instances lexicograpically .",
    "a language @xmath206 is characterized by the fact that for every instance which is in @xmath207 , there is a short _ certificate _ , given which one can verify in polynomial time that the instance is indeed in @xmath207 . for @xmath50-sat this certificate is an assignment of truth values showing that the instance is actually satisfiable .",
    "for an instance of @xmath50-sat which is satisfiable we choose the the first satisfying assignment in the usual truth - table order .",
    "we code this satisfying assignment using generators @xmath208 in the following way . for our running example",
    "given above , the first line of the truth - table assigning all variables the value false satisfies the instance .",
    "so we code this assignment as @xmath209    the absolute values of the exponents again represent the variables and the sign of the exponent is negative if the variable is assigned the value false and positive if the variable is assigned the value .",
    "the defining relators we use will be words in exponential normal form in the free group @xmath20 on generators @xmath210    if @xmath211 is a satisfiable instance in the enumeration @xmath212 defined above , let @xmath213 denote the coding of this instance on the generators @xmath214 for @xmath215 and let @xmath216 denote the coding of this instance on the generators @xmath217 for @xmath218 .",
    "let @xmath219 represent the coding of this instance on the generators @xmath220 for @xmath221 .",
    "finally , let @xmath222 represent the coding of the satisfying truth assignment for this instance on the generators @xmath223 .",
    "the basic defining relators for our group @xmath0 is the set @xmath224 where @xmath225 is @xmath226    and where @xmath211 ranges over all _ satisfiable _ instances in the enumeration @xmath212 .",
    "note that although the greek letters now represent long words on the given generators , taking them to correspond to the roman letters of the previous groups shows that the general form of the defining relators is essentially the same as before .",
    "we now need to use small cancellation theory over free products , which is essentially like small cancellation theory over free groups . for technical details",
    "we again refer to lyndon - schupp@xcite , but we review some basic definitions",
    ". a free group @xmath20 with a specified free basis can be viewed as the free product of the infinite cyclic groups generated by the specified generators .",
    "the free product normal form is given by the normal form with exponents but the _ free product length _ @xmath227 of a normal form is just the number of syllables in @xmath2 .",
    "we now view @xmath20 as this free product .",
    "if @xmath228 and @xmath229 are free product normal forms with the last syllable of @xmath2 and the first syllable of @xmath3 in the same factor , then there is _ cancellation _ in the product @xmath230 if @xmath231 and _ consolidation _ in the product @xmath230 if @xmath232 .",
    "an element @xmath233 is _ weakly cyclically reduced _ if @xmath234 or @xmath235 .",
    "a set @xmath236 is _ symmetrized _ if every element of @xmath19 is weakly cyclically reduced and if @xmath21 then every weakly cyclically reduced conjugate of @xmath22 and @xmath23 is also in @xmath19 .",
    "an element @xmath33 has _ semi - reduced form _",
    "@xmath230 if there is no cancellation in the product @xmath230 .",
    "note that consolidation is allowed .",
    "an element @xmath237 is a _ piece relative to r _ if @xmath19 contains _ distinct _",
    "elements @xmath238 and @xmath239 with semi - reduced forms @xmath240 and @xmath241 .",
    "the metric small cancellation condition is now    _ condition _ @xmath242 : if @xmath21 has semi - reduced form @xmath243 where @xmath237 is a piece , then @xmath244 . also , every element of @xmath19 has length greater than @xmath245 .",
    "the set @xmath19 of defining relators we now use is the symmetrized closure of the set @xmath19 defined above , that is , all weakly cyclically reduced conjugates of elements of @xmath19 and their inverses .",
    "since there can be only one basic relator corresponding to a particular instance of @xmath50-sat , it is easy to see that the maximum length of a piece relative to @xmath19 is at most the length of the conjugating part of the relator",
    ". thus our set @xmath19 of relators satisfies @xmath246 .",
    "given this small cancellation condition the geometry of conjugacy diagrams is the same as in the case of quotients of free groups ( not viewed as free products ) .",
    "thus in the quotient group @xmath247 where @xmath248 is the normal closure of @xmath19 we have    @xmath249    if and only if the instance @xmath211 is satisfiable .",
    "it follows exactly as in our previous discussion that powers of variants of the above are the only hard instances .",
    "thus each individual conjugacy problem is decidable in quadratic time and the conjugacy problem as a whole is generically linear time .",
    "thus the conjugacy problem of @xmath0 is @xmath13-complete and the other requirements are met .",
    "we have shown that one can bound the complexity of all individual conjugacy problems while making the global conjugacy problem arbitrarily complex . in miller",
    "s famous examples of residually finite , finitely presented groups @xmath0 with undecidable conjugacy problem , there is always some element @xmath173 for which @xmath250 is undecidable ( lemma 4 on page 27 in @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite shows that the individual conjugacy problems @xmath251 in miller s group are solvable in polynomial time for for all @xmath33 from an exponentially generic subset of @xmath0 .",
    "this leads one to ask about the opposite phenomenon .    are there recursively presented groups @xmath0 with solvable word problem such that if the individual conjugacy problems are decidable on a computably enumerable subset @xmath252 then @xmath253 is negligible , or indeed exponentially negligible ?",
    "although theorem [ th : turing ] shows that there is no general effective way to build a uniform decision algorithm for the conjugacy problem from solutions of the individual conjugacy problems , the following general lemma holds .",
    "let @xmath47 be a recursively presented group .",
    "if @xmath254 is a finite set of pairwise nonconjugate elements of @xmath0 then there is a partial algorithm @xmath114 which decides the conjugacy problem on the union @xmath255 of the conjugacy classes of the @xmath256 .",
    "the partial algorithm @xmath114 works as follows .",
    "since @xmath0 is recursively presented , when given elements @xmath257 , we can begin enumerating in parallel all words equal in @xmath0 to conjugates of the @xmath256 .",
