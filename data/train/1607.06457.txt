    "this rules out the possibility @xmath190 and shows that @xmath175 does not condense for @xmath183 .",
    "the case @xmath191 needs to be considered separately , as both lines in eq .   are identical in this case , and therefore do not lead to a contradiction .",

    "in the case @xmath193 , we can rely on the following argument to disprove this assumption : as all anyons in so(3)@xmath0 with @xmath1 odd have distinct quantum dimension , it follows that the two anyons @xmath194 and @xmath195 restrict to distinct particles and in particular @xmath196  with eq .",
    "( 2 ) from the main text this implies that @xmath197 neither splits nor condenses . in the case",

    "our no - go theorem applies to all bosons @xmath194 and @xmath195 with zero mode sets @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",
    "we can then use the set @xmath204 , containing the fusion product of any particle in @xmath202 with any particle in @xmath203 , to prove that @xmath200 can not condense . to show that @xmath205 is a set of zero modes of @xmath200 , the main challenge is to show that the product of any two elements from @xmath205 can not condense .",
    "the product of any two elements from @xmath205 is always of the form @xmath197 .",
    "we have shown that when @xmath193 such particles can not condense .",
    "we therefore need only show that non - trivial particles of form @xmath197 with @xmath206 both bosons can not condense . in order to show they are not condensable",
    ", we can use the proof given for example ( ii ) .",
    "for that , observe that the anyons @xmath200 have the same fusion coefficients among themselves as the @xmath127 anyons in so(3)@xmath0 in example  ( ii ) have , i.e. , @xmath207 , where @xmath208 so(3)@xmath0 . recall that conditions 13 from the definition of a set of zero modes only depend on the fusion coefficients @xmath209 and the information",

    "therefore the @xmath212 anyons do not condense and all @xmath170 have distinct restrictions .",
    "we conclude that for any @xmath213 only @xmath214 is permitted and hence eq",
    ".   implies that @xmath175 does not restrict to the identity @xmath25 , i.e. , it does not condense .",

    "this implies none of @xmath215 splits , which proves the assumption 2 of the induction step for @xmath157 .",
    "we have thus shown inductively that none of the particles ( except for the vacuum ) restricts to the vacuum in the @xmath7-layer theory so(3)@xmath218 .",

    "we have seen from the examples discussed in the main text , that the no - go theorem can often be used to not only show that individual bosons in a tqft can not condense , but that an entire tqft is not condensable . here ,",
    "we extend this discussion to examples of tqfts that have noncondensable sub - structures .",
    "this problem is motived by physical examples : in the fractional quantum hall effect , for instance , one frequently discusses phases that are described by a direct ( or semi - direct ) product of an abelian and a non - abelian tqft .",
    "a simple example is the @xmath219 read - rezayi state of bosons , which is described by the tqft @xmath220 .",
    "while such a theory admits condensations , already in the @xmath221 sector , when enough layers are considered , one has the intuition that the noncondensability of fibonacci should still constrain the possible condensations .    consider a tqft @xmath222 where @xmath223 is an abelian tqft ( i.e. , all its anyons have quantum dimension 1 ) .",
    "further , for all particles @xmath224 ( not only for the bosons ) , except for the vacuum , let there exist a set @xmath36 of zero modes of @xmath35 , containing anyons from @xmath17 , such that the quantum dimensions satisfy @xmath225 then , any possible condensation transition will lead to a theory of the form @xmath226 where the abelian tqft @xmath227 can be obtained from @xmath223 through a condensation .",
    "[ abelian lemma ]    this lemma follows almost directly from the no - go theorem .",
    "let us denote a particle from @xmath228 by the pair @xmath229 where @xmath224 and @xmath230 .",
    "if @xmath229 is boson , we can show that it has to be an uncondensable one , except if @xmath231 .",
    "the set @xmath232 ( where @xmath233 form a set @xmath43 of zero modes of @xmath35 whose existence is guaranteed by assumption ) satisfies all the conditions 13 form the definition of a set of @xmath229 zero modes . since @xmath108 is an abelian particle , @xmath234 and eq .",
    "directly implies that the sum of the quantum dimensions of the particles in @xmath235 satisfies the inequality  ( 4 ) from the main text .",
    "hence , @xmath229 can not condense . in turn , this implies any condensable boson in @xmath228 is of the form @xmath236 .",
    "a condensate of this form is transparent to the anyons in @xmath17 and will thus leave this sub - tqft unaffected .",
    "it will only induce a condensation @xmath237 , so that the final theory is of the from  .",
    "we return to the example of @xmath220 . consider @xmath7 layers of this theory , i.e. , @xmath238 .",
    "this multi - layer tqft satisfies all assumptions of lemma  [ abelian lemma ] : for each anyon @xmath239 , a choice for the set @xmath43 is given by @xmath240 .",

    "<S> before establishing that they satisfy the conditions for a set @xmath135 , let us show that eq </S>",
    "<S> .   holds for @xmath135 . for large @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> , we can rely on the following asymptotic estimate . using that the sine function in eq .   </S>",

    "<S> that @xmath135 form a set of zero modes localized by @xmath131 provided that all bosons with @xmath141 can not condense . </S>",

    "<S> we apply our no - go theorem successively to bosons @xmath131 in range ii in order of increasing @xmath131 . using the result that all bosons in range i are uncondensable , one verifies that the particles @xmath127 with @xmath142 form a set @xmath135 . as for range </S>",
    "<S> i , we can estimate the quantum dimensions . from the relation @xmath143=\\sin[\\pi(k-2j_b+1)/(k+2)]$ ] we can estimate the quantum dimension of @xmath131 using @xmath143<\\pi(k-2j_b+1)/(k+2)$ ] . </S>",

    "<S> simplifies to @xmath149 , which holds for all @xmath131 in range ii if @xmath150 . </S>",
    "<S> we verified explicitly that eq .   </S>",
    "<S> holds for all bosons in range ii if @xmath151 ( they appear in @xmath152 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this concludes our proof that no condensation transition is possible in the so(3)@xmath0 tqft for any odd @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that this result can be readily extended to su(2)@xmath0 with @xmath1 odd , since so(3)@xmath0 is the projection of su(2)@xmath0 to anyons with integer @xmath127 . </S>",
    "<S> one simply includes the half - integer @xmath127 anyons in the theory ( none of which are bosons ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sets @xmath43 as defined above remain the same and so do all the quantum dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we also showed the noncondensability of su(2)@xmath0 , with @xmath1 odd . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the ade classification of su(2)@xmath0  @xcite : there are no off - diagonal modular invariant partition functions for odd @xmath1 in su(2)@xmath0  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the no - go theorem provides a proof of this fact that is complementary to the ade classification .    </S>",
    "<S> _ example ( iii ) : multiple layers of _ so(3)@xmath0  we can show that any number of layers of so(3)@xmath0 , with @xmath1 odd , does not contain condensable bosons . </S>",
    "<S> fixing @xmath1 , the proof proceeds again by induction . as induction base </S>",
    "<S> , we proof that all multi - layer anyons with a nontrivial particle in only a single layer ( and the identity anyon in the other @xmath153 layers ) can not condense nor split . to show that , we can use the single - layer result from example ( ii ) . for the induction step </S>",
    "<S> , we assume that for a fixed @xmath154 all multi - layer anyons with nontrivial particles in @xmath155 layers , @xmath156 , can not condense and do not split . we can then show that the same holds for multilayer anyons with nontrivial particles in @xmath157 layers , completing the induction . </S>",
    "<S> the details of this proof are given in  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ summary _  we have presented a generally applicable no - go theorem against the condensation of a topological boson and illustrated it with several examples . </S>",
    "<S> the proof of our theorem uses mostly the fusion ( as compared to the braiding ) information of the tqft . </S>",
    "<S> we showed a connection between our results and the ade classification of su(2)@xmath0 theories , indicating that the no - go theorem might be useful for the classification of modular invariant partition functions of conformal field theories more broadly .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it would be interesting to study , whether other obstructions against boson condensation exist or whether our no - go theorem actually constitutes a necessary condition . in all examples we know , noncondensability is captured by the no - go theorem .    </S>",
    "<S> the no - go theorem can not only be used to directly classify ( symmetry enriched ) tqfts , but also symmetry protected topological phases without intrinsic topological order . </S>",
    "<S> the classification of the latter is often related to the former upon gauging the protecting symmetry .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    finally , we note that a particle physics analogy of the no - go theorem is that a particle can not decay if its mass is smaller than the total mass of its potential products . in this picture desintegration </S>",
