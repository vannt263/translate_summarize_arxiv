    "in healthy cells , a loopback mechanism involving the protein p53 is believed to cause growth arrest and apoptosis as a response to dna damage @xcite .",
    "mutations in the sequence of p53 that potentially interfere with this mechanism have been observed to lead to the upraise of cancer @xcite .    under normal conditions",
    "the amount of p53 protein in the cell is kept low by a genetic network built of the mdm2 gene , the mdm2 protein and the p53 protein itself .",
    "p53 is produced at a essentially constant rate and promotes the expression of the mdm2 gene @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the mdm2 protein binds to p53 and promotes its degradation @xcite , decreasing its concentration .",
    "when dna is damaged , a cascade of events causes phosphorylation of several serines in the p53 protein , which modifies its binding properties to mdm2 @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the cell experiences a sudden increase in the concentration of p53 , which activates a group of genes ( e.g. , p21 , bax @xcite ) responsible for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis .",
    "this increase in p53 can reach values of the order of 16 times the basal concentration @xcite .",
    "a qualitative study of the time dependence of the concentration of p53 and mdm2 has been carried out in ref .",
    "approximately one hour after the stress event ( i.e. , the dna damage which causes phosphorylation of p53 serines ) , a peak in the concentration of p53 is observed , lasting for about one hour .",
    "this peak partially overlaps with the peak in the concentration of mdm2 , lasting from @xmath1 to @xmath2 hours after the stress event .",
    "another small peak in the concentration of p53 is observed after several hours .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to provide the simpest mathematical model which describes all the known aspect of the p53mdm2 loop , and to investigate how the loop is robust to small variations to the ingredients of the model .",
    "the `` weak points '' displayed by the system , namely those variations in some parameters which cause abrupt changes in the overall behaviour of the loop , are worth to be investigated experimentally because they can contain informations about how a cell bacomes tumoral .    the model we suggest",
    "is described in fig .",
    "the total number of p53 molecules , produced at constant rate @xmath3 , is indicated with @xmath4 .",
    "the amount of the complexes built of p53 bound to mdm2 is called @xmath5 .",
    "these complexes cause the degradation of p53 ( through the ubiquitin pathway ) , at a rate @xmath6 , while mdm2 re  enters the loop .",
    "furthermore , p53 has a spontaneous decay rate @xmath7 .",
    "the total number of mdm2 proteins is indicated as @xmath8 .",
    "since p53 activates the expression of the mdm2 gene , the production rate of mdm2 is proportional ( with constant @xmath9 ) to the probability that the complex p53/mdm  gene is built .",
    "we assume that the complex p53/mdm2gene is at equilibrium with its components , where @xmath10 is the dissociation constant and only free p53 molecules ( whose amount is @xmath11 ) can participate into the complex .",
    "the protein mdm2 has a decay rate @xmath12 . the constants @xmath7 and @xmath12",
    "describe not only the spontaneous degradation of the proteins , but also their binding to some other part of the cell , not described explicitely by the model .",
    "the free proteins p53 and mdm2 are considered to be at equilibrium with their bound complex pm , and the equilibrium constant is called @xmath0 .    the dynamics of the system can be described by the equations @xmath13 in the second equation we allow a delay @xmath14 in the production of mdm2 , due to the fact that the transcription and translation of mdm2 lasts for some time after that p53 has bound to the gene .",
    "the choice of the numeric parameters is somewhat difficult , due to the lack of reliable experimental data .",
    "the degradation rate through ubiquitin pathway has been estimated to be @xmath15 @xcite , while the spontaneous degradation of p53 is @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the dissociation constant between p53 and mdm2 is @xmath17 @xcite ( expressed as number of molecules , assuming for the nucleus a volume of @xmath18 ) , and the dissociation constant between p53 and the mdm2 gene is @xmath19 @xcite . in lack of detailed values for the protein",
    "production rates , we have used typical values , namely @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the degradation rate of mdm2 protein has been chosen of the order of @xmath22 to keep the stationary amount of mdm2 of the order of @xmath23 .",
    "the behaviour of the above model is independent on the volume in which we assume the reaction takes place . that is",
    ", multiplying @xmath3 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath0 by the same constant @xmath24 gives exactly the same dynamics of the rescaled quantities @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "futhermore , due to the fact that the chosen parameters put the system in the saturated regime , an increase in the producing rates @xmath3 and @xmath9 with respect to @xmath10 and @xmath0 will not affect the response .",
    "on the contrary , a decrease of @xmath3 and @xmath9 with respect to @xmath10 and @xmath0 can drive the system into a non  saturated regime , inhibiting the response mechanism .",
    "in the case that the production of mdm2 can be regarded as instantaneous ( no delay , @xmath27 ) , the concentration of p53 is rather insensitive to the change of the dissociation constant @xmath0 .",
    "the stationary values of @xmath4 and @xmath8 are found as fixed points of the equations [ eq1 ] ( see appendix ) and in table i we list the stationary values @xmath28 of the amount of p53 molecules for values of @xmath0 spanning seven orders of magnitude around the basal value @xmath29 . moreover , transient oscillatory behaviour upon change in the dissociation constant @xmath0 is not observed .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the eigenvalues of the stationary points ( listed in table i ) have negative real parts , indicating stable fixed points , and rather small imaginary pats indicating absence of oscillations .",
    "more precisely , the variation @xmath30 of the stationary amount of p53 if the dissociation constant undergoes a change @xmath31 can be estimated , under the approximation that @xmath32 ( cf . the appendix ) , to be @xmath33 the fact that @xmath30 is approximately linear with @xmath31 with a proportionality constant which is at most of the order of @xmath34 makes this system rather inefficient as response mechanism .",
    "furthermore , it does not agree with the experimental data which show a peak of p53 followed , after several minutes , by a peak in mdm2 @xcite , and not just a shift of the two concentration to higher values .    to check whether the choice of the system parameters affects the observed behaviour , we have repeated all the calculations varying each parameter of five orders of magnitude around the values used above",
    ". the results ( listed in table ii for @xmath3 and @xmath10 and not shown for the other parameters ) indicate the same behaviour as above ( negative real part and no or small imaginary part in the eigenvalues ) .",
    "consequently , the above results about the dynamics of p53 seem not to be sensitive to the detailed choice of parameters ( on the contrary , the amount of mdm2 is quite sensitive ) .",
    "the dynamics changes qualitatively if we introduce a nonzero delay in eqs .",
    "[ eq1 ] . keeping that the halflife of an rna molecule is of the order of 1200 s @xcite",
    ", we repeat the calculations with @xmath35 . the eqs .",
    "[ eq1 ] are solved numerically , starting from the conditions @xmath36 and @xmath37 and making use of a variable  step adams algorithm .",
    "after the system has reached its stationary state under basal condition , a stress is introduced ( at time @xmath38 s ) by changing instantaneously the dissociation constant @xmath0 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we display a case in which the stress multiplies @xmath0 by a factor @xmath39 ( a ) , a case in which it divides it by a factor @xmath39 ( b ) and by a factor @xmath40 ( c ) .",
    "when @xmath0 is increased by any factor , the response is very similar to the response of the system without delay ( cf .",
    "e.g. fig . [ fig2]a ) . on the contrary",
    ", when @xmath0 is decreased the system displays an oscillatory behaviour . the height @xmath30 of the response peak",
    "is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] as a function of the quantity which multiplies @xmath0 .",
    "if the multiplier is larger than @xmath41 the response is weak or absent . at the value",
    "@xmath41 the system has a marked response ( cf . also figs .",
    "[ fig2]b and c ) .",
    "the maximum of the first peak takes place approximately @xmath42s after the stress , which is consistent with the lag ",
    "time observed in the experiment @xcite , and the peaks are separated from @xmath43s .    although it has been suggested that the effect of the stress is to increase the dissociation constant between p53 and mdm2 @xcite , our results indicate that an efficient response take place if @xmath0 decreases of a factor @xmath44 ( cf .",
    "[ fig2]b ) .",
    "one has to notice that the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite have been reached from the analysis _ in vivo _ of the overall change in the concentration of p53 , not from the direct measurement of the binding constant after phosphorylation .",
    "our results also agree with the finding that p53asp20 ( a mutated form of p53 which mimicks phosphorylated p53 , due to the negative charge owned by aspartic acid ) binds mdm2 _ in vitro _",
    "more tightly than p53ala20 ( which mimicks unphosphorylated p53 ) @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by molecular energy calculations made with classical force fields .",
    "even if this kind of force fields is not really reliable for the calculation of binding constants , it gives an estimate of the sign of the change in interaction among p53 and mdm2 upon phosphorylation .",
    "we have performed an energy minimization of the conformation of the system composed by the binding sites of p53 and mdm2 , starting form the crystallographic positions of ref . @xcite and using the force fields mm3 @xcite and mmff @xcite , for both the wild  type system and for the system where serine 20 of p53 in phosphorylated . using mm3 we found that the phosphorylated system has an electrostatic energy @xmath45 kcal / mol lower than the wild  type system , while this difference is @xmath46 kcal / mol using the mmff force field .",
    "our calculations suggest that phopshprylated p53 is more attracted by mdm2 due to the enhanced interaction of phosphorylated ser20 with lys60 , lys46 and lys70 of mdm2 , and consequently the dissociation constant is lowered .    the robustness of the response mechanism with respect to the parameters of the system , which is typical of many biological systems ( cf . , e.g. , @xcite ) , has been checked both to assess the validity of the model and to search for weak points which could be responsible for the upraise of the disease .",
    "each parameter has been varied of five orders of magnitude around its basal quantity .",
    "the results are listed in table iii .",
    "one can notice that the response mechanism is quite robust to changes in the parameters @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath9 . for low values of @xmath6 or @xmath9",
    "the system no longer oscillates , but displays , in any case , a rapid increase in the amount of @xmath4 which can kill the cell .",
    "this is true also for large values of @xmath12 .",
    "what is dangerous for the cell is a decrease of @xmath12 or of @xmath10 , which would drop the amount of p53 and let the damaged cell survive .",
    "this corresponds either to an increase of the affinity between p53 and the mdm2 gene , or to an increase of mdm2 half  life .    to be noted that , unlike the case @xmath27 , the system with delay never displays damped oscillations as a consequence of the variation of the parameters in the range studied in the present work .",
    "this sharp behaviour further testifies to the robustness of the response mechanism .",
    "anyway , one has to keep in mind that the oscillating response produces the death of the cell , and consequently the long  time behaviour is only of theoretical interest .",
    "the minimum value of the delay which gives rise to the oscillatory behaviour is @xmath47s . for values of the delay larger than this threshold , the amplitude of the response is linear with @xmath14 ( cf .",
    "4 ) , a fact which is compatible with the explanation of the response mechanism of section iv .",
    "the lag time before the p53 response is around @xmath48s ( in accordance with the 1h delay observed experimentally @xcite and is independent on all parameters , except @xmath9 and @xmath14 .",
    "the dependence of the lag time on @xmath14 is approximately linear up to @xmath49s ( the longest delay analyzed ) .",
    "increasing @xmath9 the lag time increases to @xmath50s ( for @xmath51 ) and @xmath52s ( for @xmath53 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the period of oscillation depends only on the delay @xmath14 , being approximately linear with it .",
    "we have repeated the calculations squaring the variable @xmath4 in eqs .",
    "1 , to keep into account the cooperativity induced by the fact that the active form of p53 is a dimer of dimers @xcite .",
    "the results display qualitative differences neither for non  delayed nor for the delayed system .",
    "all these facts can be rationalized by analyzing the mechanism which produces the response .",
    "the possibility to trigger a _ rise _ in p53 as a dynamic response to an _ increased _ binding between p53 and mdm2 , relies on the fact that a sudden increase in p  m binding diminishes the production of @xmath54 , and therefore ( subsequently ) diminishes the amount of @xmath5 .",
    "in other words , while the change in @xmath0 has no direct effect in the first of eqs . [ eq1 ] , it directly reduces mdm2 production by subtracting p53 from the gene which producese mdm2 .    mathematically , the oscillations arise because the saturated nature of the binding @xmath5 imply that pm is approximately equal to the minimum between p and m. each time the curves associated with p and m cross each other ( either at a given time or @xmath14 instants before ) , the system has to follow a different set of dynamic equations than before , finding itself in a state far from stationarity .",
    "this gives rise to the observed peaks .",
    "to be precise , the starting condition ( before the stress ) is @xmath55 .",
    "the stress reduces the dissociation constant @xmath0 of , at least , one order of magnitude , causing a drop in @xmath4 , which falls below @xmath8 . for small values of @xmath0",
    "( to be precise , for @xmath56 ) , one can make the simplification @xmath57 , and consequently rewrite eqs .",
    "[ eq1 ] as @xmath58 each period after the stress can be divided in four phases . in the first one @xmath59 and @xmath60 , so that @xmath4 stays constant at its stationary value @xmath61 , while @xmath8 decreases with time constant @xmath62 towards zero ( not exactly zero , since the approximated equations do not hold for @xmath63 ) . in the second phase one",
    "has to consider the second ( @xmath60 ) and the third ( @xmath64 ) equations ( [ simply2 ] and [ simply3 ] ) .",
    "the new stationary value for @xmath4 is @xmath65 which is much larger than @xmath28 since @xmath66 .",
    "this boost takes place in a time of the order of @xmath67 , so if @xmath68 , as in the present case , @xmath4 has no time to reach the stationary state and ends in a lower value . in the meanwhile",
    ", @xmath8 remains in the low value given by eq .",
    "[ simply2 ] . at a time @xmath14 after the stress eq .",
    "[ simply2 ] gives way to eq .",
    "[ simply4 ] .",
    "the latter is composed by a positive term which is @xmath69 if @xmath70 and @xmath71 under the opposite condition . since @xmath72 ( it refers to the boost of @xmath4 ) ,",
    "then the new stationary value of @xmath8 is @xmath73 .",
    "the raise of @xmath8 takes place in a time of the order of @xmath62 and causes the decrease of @xmath4 , whose production rate is ruled by @xmath74 .",
    "the fourth phase begins when @xmath4 approaches @xmath8 .",
    "now one has to keep eqs .",
    "[ simply1 ] and [ simply4 ] , so that @xmath4 returns to the basal value @xmath28 , while @xmath8 stays for a period of @xmath14 at the value @xmath73 reached in the third phase .",
    "after such period , eq .",
    "[ simply2 ] substitutes eq .",
    "[ simply4 ] and another peak takes place .",
    "the heigth of the p53 peak is given by @xmath75 if @xmath4 has time to reach its stationary state of phase two ( i.e. , if @xmath76 ) , or by @xmath77 if the passage to the third phase takes place before it can reach the stationary state .",
    "the width of the peak is @xmath78 and the spacing among the peaks @xmath78 , so that the oscillation period is @xmath79 .    the necessary conditions for the response mechanism to be effective are 1 ) that @xmath80 , that is that the stationary value of @xmath4 just after the stress is much lower than the stationary value of @xmath8 , 2 ) that @xmath66 , in such a way that the stationary state of @xmath4 in the second phase is much larger than that in the first phase , in order to display the boost , 3 ) that @xmath81 , otherwise @xmath8 has not enough time to decrease in phase one and to increase in phase three .",
    "the failure of the response for low values of @xmath6 ( cf . table 3 ) is due to the fall of condition 2 ) , the failure for small @xmath9 is caused by condition 1 ) , the failure at small and large values of @xmath12 is associated with conditions 3 ) and 1 ) , respectively . at low values of @xmath10",
    "the response does not take place because the positive term in eq .",
    "[ simply4 ] is always @xmath82 , and thus @xmath8 never decreases .",
    "in summa , we have shown that the delay is an essential ingredient of the system to have a ready and robust peak in p53 concentration as response to a damage stress . in order to have a peak",
    "which is comparable with those observed experimentally , the dissociation constant between p53 and mdm2 has to decrease of a factor @xmath39 .",
    "although it is widely believed that phosphorylation of p53 increases the dissociation constant , we observe an oscillating behaviour similar to the experimental one only if @xmath0 decreases . in this case",
    "the response is quite robust with respect to the parameters , except upon increaasing of the half  life of mdm2 and upon decreasing of the dissociation constant between p53 and the mdm2 gene , in which cases there is no response to the stress .",
    "moreover , an increase in the production rate of mdm2 can delay the response and this can be dangerous to the cell as well .",
    "we hope that detailed experimental measurements of the physical parameters of the system will be made soon , in order to improve the model and to be able to make more precise predictions about the weak point of the mechanism , weak points which could be intimately connected with the upraise of cancer .",
    "the stationary condition for eqs .",
    "[ eq1 ] without delay can be found by the intersection of the curves @xmath83 which have been obtained by the conditions @xmath84 , explicitating @xmath5 from the first of eqs .",
