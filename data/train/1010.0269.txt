    "coulomb interactions between carriers in semiconductor materials including nanocrystals ( ncs ) play central role in photoexcited dynamics.@xcite introducing conduction and valence bands within mean field ( e.g. , effective mass ) approximation , these interactions can be partitioned into two groups.@xcite first group combines the interactions which conserve the number of electrons / holes , and can be associated with the diagonal terms in the electron - hole interaction hamiltonian . in other words , these interactions are acting within exciton bands of different multiplicity , and therefore , will be referred as the _ intraband _ coulomb interactions .",
    "the intraband interactions determine the binding energies of excitons , trions , and multi - excitons.@xcite spectroscopically , these quantities can be measured as energy shifts in transient - absorption and fluorescent techniques .",
    "one of the important areas where such interactions are widely exploited is wave - function engineering in semiconductor heterostructures @xcite with applications to the problem of the lasing in single - exciton regime.@xcite    second group includes off - diagonal electron - hole interaction terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "these interactions lead to the valence - conduction band transitions which change the number of electrons and holes conserving the total charge . in other words ,",
    "the off - diagonal coulomb interactions are responsible for the photoexcited dynamics which involves transitions between exciton bands of different multiplicity .",
    "therefore , we refer to such interactions as the _ interband _ coulomb interactions . important examples involving the interband transitions are non - radiative auger recombination and impact ionization processes.@xcite    lately , carrier multiplication ( cm ) in semiconductor ncs has received significant attention.@xcite also referred as the multi - exciton generation , this is a process of more than one electron - hole pair generation per absorbed photon which has great potential for applications in photovoltaic , photochemical , and energy storage devices.@xcite a number of models for cm dynamics based on the interband coulomb interactions which go beyond simple impact ionization model have been proposed recently.@xcite direct experimental technique for measuring interband coulomb interactions in ncs should greatly advance our understanding of cm by shedding new light on the multi - exciton photogeneration dynamics and providing verification of the proposed theoretical models .",
    "since cm takes place in the region of high exciton and biexciton dos , key features associated with a variety of the inter- and intraband interactions are spectrally overlapped and can not be resolved using conventional techniques , e.g. , transient absorption and time - resolved fluorescence spectroscopies . in this case",
    ", the resolution can be tremendously enhanced by using coherent ultrafast nonlinear techniques in which various interaction pathways are distinguished through the spatial phase - matching conditions.@xcite further representing the coherent signal as a 2d fourier transform polarization with respect to various pulse delay times , one can gain direct insight into the hidden interactions by looking at the position , line - shape , intensity and phase of the associated cross - peaks.@xcite the latter techniques are referred as 2d correlation spectroscopies and represent ultrafst optical counterpart of 2d nmr.@xcite    among 2d correlation spectroscopies , the double - quantum coherence technique proposed by mukamel and co - workers is considered to be most sensitive to the many - body correlations.@xcite this technique has been applied to study the intrerband coulomb correlations leading to biexciton formation in organic molecular systems,@xcite and semiconductor quantum wells@xcite .",
