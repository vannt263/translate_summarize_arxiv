    "the modeling and the analysis of count data has received increasing attention during the last decade .",
    "there are possible applications in various fields , such as biometrics , econometrics and finance ; see davis , dunsmuir and wang @xcite and davis and wu @xcite for examples .",
    "a comprehensive account of models for time series of counts is given in kedem and fokianos @xcite , chapter  4 .",
    "in the majority of cases the count variables are assumed to be poisson distributed , conditioned on the past and perhaps some additional regressor variables .",
    "models for count data consist of at least two processes : an observable process of counts and an accompanying intensity process that is usually not observed .",
    "cox @xcite and later davis , dunsmuir and wang @xcite classified these models into parameter - driven and observation - driven specifications .",
    "in the first case , the accompanying intensity process evolves independently of the past history of the observation process while , in the latter case , the values on the intensity process do depend on past observations .",
    "the major aim of this paper is to derive important properties such as stationarity , mixing and ergodicity for a certain class of observation - driven processes .",
    "davis , dunsmuir and wang @xcite mentioned that , in contrast to parameter - driven models where these properties are inherited by the observation process from the accompanying intensity process , there is much less theory available in the case of observation - driven models .",
    "actually , ergodicity has been shown so far in a few special cases only  see grunwald , hyndman , tedesco and tweedie @xcite , streett @xcite , davis , dunsmuir and streett @xcite , zheng and basawa @xcite and fokianos , rahbek and tjstheim @xcite . in these papers , the authors could use classical markov chain theory .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study a model where the observations @xmath0 are poisson distributed , conditioned on the past , with an intensity @xmath1 depending on one lagged value of the count process and the intensity process ; that is , @xmath2 , for some function  @xmath3 .",
    "models of this type have been considered before  by  rydberg and shephard @xcite , streett @xcite , davis , dunsmuir and streett @xcite , fokianos , rahbek and tjstheim @xcite and fokianos and tjstheim @xcite .",
    "an important aspect is that such models allow for an autoregressive ( ar ) feedback mechanism in the intensity process and it can be expected that this leads to a parsimonious parametrization . for clarity of exposition , we do not include additional regressor variables that are often also incorporated in specifications of the intensity . under a contractive condition on  @xmath3",
    ", we state in section  [ s2 ] that the bivariate process @xmath4 has a unique stationary distribution . the proof of this result",
    "is based on a simple construction , where independently started versions of the process are coupled in such a way that they converge to each other .",
    "section  [ s3 ] contains the main results . for a stationary version of the process",
    ", we prove absolute regularity ( @xmath5-mixing ) of the univariate count process . since the latter process is not markovian , we can not rely on standard arguments from markov chain theory ; rather , we use coupling arguments to derive this result .",
    "we also discuss an example that shows that the bivariate process @xmath6 and even the intensity process @xmath7 are not absolutely regular in general . however , since the intensities can be written as measurable functionals of the count variables , we conclude from the mixing property of the count process that the bivariate process is ergodic . in section  [ s4 ] ,",
    "we propose a test for a particular specification of the intensity process .",
    "we use a test statistic that has been applied before by several authors in connection with independent poisson random variables . using the ergodicity result from section  [ s3 ]",
    ", we can show that the test statistic is asymptotically normal .",
    "all proofs are deferred to a final section  [ sp ] .",
    "we assume that @xmath8 is a time series of counts , accompanied by an intensity process @xmath9 .",
    "denote by @xmath10 the @xmath11-field generated by the past and present values of the two processes at time  @xmath12 .",
    "we assume throughout that @xmath13 and @xmath14 for some function @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) . for the time being , the starting value @xmath17 may be random or non - random .",
    "it follows from the structure of the model that @xmath18 and that the bivariate process @xmath4 forms a homogeneous markov chain . throughout this paper",
    "we will assume that the function  @xmath3 satisfies the following contractive condition : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are non - negative constants with @xmath22 .",
    "this includes as a special case a linear specification where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are non - negative constants with @xmath25 .",
    "rydberg and shephard @xcite proposed such a model for describing the number of trades on the new york stock exchange in certain time intervals and called it the @xmath26 model .",
    "stationarity and other properties for this model were derived by streett @xcite and ferland , latour and oraichi @xcite , who referred to it as the @xmath27 model , and fokianos , rahbek and tjstheim @xcite .",
    "the generality of condition ( [ 2.3 ] ) is chosen to include nonlinear specifications such as the exponential ar model proposed in fokianos , rahbek and tjstheim @xcite . in this case , the intensity function is specified as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 .",
    "it follows from @xmath30 and @xmath31 that ( [ 2.3 ] ) is fulfilled if @xmath32 .",
    "note that ( [ 2.3 ] ) implies that @xmath33 it follows from ( [ 2.4 ] ) that @xmath34 , which leads to @xmath35 hence , the bivariate chain @xmath4 is bounded in probability on average .",
    "moreover , it follows from ( [ 2.3 ] ) that , for any open set @xmath36 , the transition probabilities @xmath37 are a continuous , and therefore also a lower semicontinuous , function . hence , the markov chain is a weak feller chain and it follows from theorem  12.1.2(ii ) in meyn and tweedie @xcite that there exists at least one stationary distribution .",
    "uniqueness of this stationary distribution , however , requires more than ( [ 2.4 ] ) and will follow from the contractive condition ( [ 2.3 ] ) .",
    "the following theorem summarizes this and a few other useful facts .",
    "[ t2.1 ] suppose that the bivariate chain @xmath4 obeys ( [ 2.1])([2.3 ] ) .",
    "then    there exists a unique stationary distribution  @xmath38 .    if @xmath39 , then @xmath40 .",
    "if @xmath41 , then @xmath42 . if @xmath43 , then @xmath44 for all @xmath45 , @xmath46 .    using the contractive property ( [ 2.3 ] ) , we will show in the proof of theorem  [ t2.1 ] that the  @xmath47-step transition laws @xmath48 converge to a common limit @xmath38 not depending on the starting value  @xmath49 , where @xmath38 is a probability measure .",
    "this will imply that  @xmath38 is the unique stationary distribution .",
    "there are alternative ways to prove theorem  [ t2.1 ] . introducing a sequence of independent `` innovations '' @xmath50 with @xmath51,$ ] we could re - express the process values as @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the cumulative distribution function of a @xmath54 distribution .",
    "this gives us a representation of @xmath4 as a randomly perturbed dynamical system with independent and identically distributed innovations .",
    "in such a context and under a contractive condition similar to our ( [ 2.3 ] ) , diaconis and freedman @xcite also proved existence and uniqueness of a stationary distribution . to this end , these authors used backward iterations to identify a random variable which has the desired stationary distribution .",
    "the approach used here is more direct and uses also elements of standard markov chain theory as described  in meyn and tweedie @xcite . finally , we would like to mention that lasota and mackey @xcite also proved the existence of a unique stationary distribution under conditions similar to our ( [ 2.3 ] ) and ( [ 2.4 ] ) ; see , in particular , equations  ( 2 ) and  ( 3 ) in their paper .",
    "their proof contains similar ingredients to our proof ; however , it is more analytic in nature while we establish a coupling to represent the convergence facts in a simple stochastic language .",
    "in this section , we state the main results of our paper , absolute regularity of the count process and , as a consequence , ergodicity of the bivariate process @xmath55 . actually ,",
    "grunwald , hyndman , tedesco and tweedie @xcite , case  ii of proposition  3 , streett @xcite and davis , dunsmuir and streett @xcite proved ergodicity in special cases .",
    "however , they made heavy use of the particular form of their link function  @xmath3 and could show that doeblin s condition is fulfilled .",
    "hence , they could employ markov chain technology to prove ergodicity .",
    "we can not use this approach in the case considered here since doeblin s condition will not be satisfied in general .",
    "another commonly used approach to proving ergodicity , which is not restricted to the case of markov chains , consists in proving first strong mixing as a sufficient condition for ergodicity .",
    "it turns out , however , that the bivariate process @xmath55 is not strongly mixing in general ; a counterexample is given in remark  [ r3 ] below .",
    "the problem lies in the discreteness of the distribution of the `` innovations '' @xmath0 while the @xmath1 take values on a continuous scale .",
    "this makes the commonly used coupling approach to proving mixing properties of markov chains impossible .",
    "to give some idea why a discrete distribution of the innovations may cause problems , we recall the well - known example of a stationary ar(1 ) process , @xmath56 , where the innovations are independent with @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "this process has a stationary distribution supported on @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "it follows from the above model equation that @xmath60 has , with probability  1 , the same sign as @xmath61 .",
    "hence , we could perfectly recover @xmath62 from @xmath60 , which clearly excludes any of the common mixing properties .",
    "( rosenblatt @xcite mentioned the fact that a process similar to @xmath63 is purely deterministic going backwards in time . a rigorous proof that it is not strong mixing",
    "was given by andrews @xcite . ) on the other hand , we can prove absolute regularity for the ( univariate ) count process @xmath64 .",
    "for this purpose , the discrete nature of the distribution of the  @xmath0 does not harm . to see why , note that we have either @xmath42 or @xmath65 ; see the proof of part  ( iii ) of theorem  [ t2.1 ] .",
    "therefore , the support of the conditional distribution of @xmath66 given @xmath67 is equal to the support of the stationary distribution of the @xmath0 and we can actually construct a successful coupling . since absolute regularity implies strong mixing , we immediately obtain ergodicity of the count process @xmath64 .",
    "moreover , as a by - product of our coupling , we see that the random intensities  @xmath1 can be expressed as measurable functionals of past variables of the count process . hence , we finally obtain the desired ergodicity of the bivariate process @xmath55 .",
    "it was stated in section  [ s2 ] that the bivariate process @xmath55 has a unique stationary distribution under the contractive condition ( [ 2.3 ] ) . in this section",
    ", we will assume throughout that this process is in its stationary regime .",
    "moreover , it proves to be quite convenient to have a two - sided stationary version , with time domain  @xmath68 rather than  @xmath69 , which exists by kolmogorov s extension theorem ; see  durrett @xcite , page  293 .",
    "here is the main result of the paper .",
    "[ t3.1 ] suppose that the bivariate chain @xmath6 is in its stationary regime and obeys  ( [ 2.1])([2.3 ] ) .",
    "then    the count process @xmath70 is absolutely regular with coefficients satisfying @xmath71    there exists a measurable function @xmath72 such that @xmath73 holds almost surely .",
    "the process @xmath6 is ergodic .",
    "@xmath74 .    in the case of a so - called @xmath27 process where @xmath1 is specified as @xmath75 , ferland , latour and oraichi @xcite proved the stronger result that all moments of @xmath1 and @xmath0 are finite . since it follows from ( [ 2.4 ] ) that @xmath76",
    ", we conjecture that their result can be generalized by simple majorization arguments to our more general framework .",
    "however , since higher - than - second moments are not needed for the purposes of this paper , we do not make the attempt to adapt their proof , which was already quite involved in the special case of a linear specification of @xmath1 .",
    "[ r3 ] theorem  [ t3.1 ] states that the count process @xmath70 is absolutely regular and , therefore , also strongly mixing under condition ( [ 2.3 ] ) .",
    "this allows us to conclude that the bivariate process @xmath6 is ergodic .",
    "however , the process @xmath6 and even the intensity process @xmath7 alone are not strongly mixing in general . to see this , consider the specification @xmath77 , where  @xmath78 is strictly monotone and satisfies @xmath79 and @xmath80 for some @xmath81 and for all @xmath82 .",
    "then  @xmath3 satisfies our contractive condition ( [ 2.3 ] ) .",
    "using the fact that @xmath83 we obtain that @xmath84,$ ] which implies that we can perfectly recover @xmath85 once we know the value of @xmath1 . iterating this argument",
    ", we see that we can recover from @xmath1 the entire past of the intensity process . taking into account that the above choice of  @xmath3 excludes the case that the intensity process is purely non - random",
    ", we conclude that a stationary version of @xmath7 can not be strongly mixing .",
    "the primary intention of the author was to devise a method of proving ergodicity of certain count processes .",
    "this is done , mainly for clarity of presentation , for the simple case where the intensity depends only on one lagged value of the count process and the intensity process .",
    "in contrast to previous work in this area , the coupling approach used here does not require markovianity of the process .",
    "the results of this paper , and in particular the ergodicity stated in theorem  [ t3.1 ] , can be generalized to more complex models with more than one or even infinitely many lagged variables .",
    "moreover , it seems to be possible to include covariates , at least if they are exogeneous .",
    "these generalizations are well beyond the scope of this paper and should be the subject of future research .",
    "there might be good reasons for assuming that the count variables are poisson distributed , conditioned on the past",
    ". however , a particular specification for the intensity function seems to be more questionable and such a choice should be supported by a statistical test . here",
    "we propose a test statistic that was originally designed for testing overdispersion in the context of i.i.d .",
    "observations ; see lee @xcite and cameron and trivedi @xcite .",
    "assume that we have observations @xmath86 from a stationary process @xmath6 obeying  ( [ 2.1 ] ) and ( [ 2.2 ] ) and that we want to test the simple hypothesis @xmath87 for some @xmath88 satisfying ( [ 2.3 ] ) , or the composite hypothesis @xmath89 where @xmath90 and the @xmath91 satisfy ( [ 2.3 ] ) .    to motivate a particular test statistic ,",
    "pretend that we additionally observe the starting value @xmath17 of the intensity process .",
    "then we could take , for testing @xmath92 against @xmath93 , the statistic @xmath94 where @xmath95 and , for @xmath96 , the @xmath97 are recursively defined as @xmath98 . the idea behind",

    "on the other hand , if  @xmath3 is not correctly specified by  @xmath88 , then the random variables @xmath102 are not centered and we can expect consistency of the test .    in the more relevant case of unknown @xmath17 ,",
    "we replace this by any arbitrarily chosen , random or non - random , starting value @xmath103 , then define recursively @xmath104 , for @xmath96 , and take the test statistic @xmath105 in the case of testing @xmath106 against @xmath107 , we estimate the parameter  @xmath108 by some estimator @xmath109 first and take then the test statistic @xmath110 here @xmath111 is again any starting value and @xmath112 , for @xmath96 .    in the context of independent observations , lee @xcite and cameron and",
    "trivedi @xcite considered a test statistic similar to ours for testing the poisson hypothesis against the alternative that the distribution belongs to the so - called katz family of distributions .",
    "this family contains as special cases the poisson , negative binomial and binomial distributions . while the variance equals the mean in the poisson case , the latter two classes contain distributions",
    "for which the variance mean ratio is strictly greater or less than  1 , respectively .",
    "therefore , lee @xcite and cameron and trivedi @xcite interpreted their tests as tests for over- or underdispersion .",
    "the same test statistic was also suggested in cox @xcite .",
    "it was also used by brnns and johansson @xcite for testing for the existence of a latent process in the context of poisson count models .",
    "again , in the case of independent data , dean and lawless @xcite and dean @xcite came up with adjusted versions of lee s and cameron and trivedi s test statistic that have the same limit distribution as the unadjusted statistic but are closer to this limit in small samples",
    ".    we will prove that the above statistics , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , are asymptotically normal with the same limit .",
    "this can be most easily done for @xmath113 since this statistic is a sum of martingale differences that allows us to apply an appropriate central limit theorem .",
