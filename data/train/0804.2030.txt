    "several such complementary probes are required , and sne ia compose the best proven , most powerful technique ( kolb 2005 ) , and in many ways are the easiest to realize at a level needed to reveal dark energy .",
    "it is often assumed that systematic errors in sn ia photometry will improve sufficiently for further refinement of cosmological tests to succeed ; they must acheive a high level of photometric precision and insensitivity to systematic error in order to measure higher - order parameters characterizing dark energy ( see linder & huterer 2003 , tonry 2004 ) .",
    "while several techniques incorporate extinction corrections to predict the luminosity of sne ia , dust in the interstellar and circumstellar medium ( ism and csm ) can have other effects .",
    "for instance , patat ( 2005 ) shows that light echoes from dust can introduce several percent changes into the luminosity @xmath0 , particularly on the decrease from maximum light , and reducing @xmath0 while increasing maximum lightcurve width @xmath1 in a stochastic manner depending on seemingly random placement of surrounding material .",

    "likewise , theory is a poor guide , in part because sn ia progenitors are a small and not well - isolated subcomponent of accreting wds : sn ia progenitors compose probably about 15% of binaries in the appropriate initial mass range ( 38 @xmath4 ) and almost certainly 240% of these ( maoz 2007 ) . since the last known galactic sn ia was in the year 1604 ( and last in the local group probably in 1885 ) , detailed ground - based study of sn ia remnants or the small fraction of ia progenitors among the larger population of wd accreting binaries is not definitive in terms of their csm .",
    "light echoes might easily provide decisive clues regarding interstellar versus circumstellar intervening material .",
    "we can learn about the 3-d distribution of scattering material by taking an image at time @xmath5 after maximum light , measuring the angular radius @xmath6 of an echoing cloud ( e.g. , in light - years ) , and one can directly infer the cloud s foreground distance . only three other sne ia have shown the clear evidence of light echoes ( sne 1991 t , 1995e and 1998bu ) . here",
    "we report on the observations that allowed discovery of a fourth , in front of sn 2006x , as well as details of those echoes regarding interstellar or circumstellar origin .",
    "sn 2006x is a rare , fortuitous case of a sn in a field imaged extensively by @xmath7 before the explosion .",
    "furthermore the extended tail in the b - band lightcurve of sn 2006x strongly hinted at the presence of a light echo ( crotts & sugerman 2006 ) .",
    "we observed sn 2006x on three visits with @xmath7 after explosion .",

    "we also took care to include in each image a bright , unsaturated stellar source for psf comparison .",

    "we refer to epochs relative to @xmath9-band maximum on ut 2006 feb 22.8 ( wang et al .",
    "2008a ) , which for these @xmath7 visits occur 87 , 304 and 680 days post - maximum .    for our day",
    "304 post - maximum epoch , the extension of the image of sn 2006x beyond the psf served as a strong clue of a light echo , since no such nebulosity was evident at this position in the pre - sn images ( crotts 2007 ) .",
    "wang et al .",
    "( 2008b , hereafter w+08 ) show on the basis of these same @xmath7 images the presence of extended nebulosity consistent with a light echo , and confirm this with keck / lris and deimos spectra of this nebulosity similar to sn 2006x at maximum light , as might be expected by a light echo .",
    "while a portion of this echo is resolved by @xmath7 , w+08 conclude on the basis of the strength of the echo - like component in their spectra that there is likely an additional component at smaller radii , probably circumstellar to the sn progenitor .",
    "our analysis of the 2006 may 21 ( 87d post - max ) images does not indicate any deviation from a stellar psf at a statistically significant level .",
    "the interstellar echo evident in later epochs ( having @xmath10 ) is too dim to stand out evidently against the sn point source ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "in contrast , the 2006 december 24 ( 304d post - max ) images show a significant indication of a non - stellar source , which motivated our 2008 january 4 observations ( 860d post - max ) . when we subtract a maximal - brightness point - source from these images , this produces a circular residual with a significant depression of flux markedly similar to that found by w+08 in their analysis of our images , so we will not present this again here .",
    "the quality of information for the interstellar echo in the 860d post - max data is , however , sufficiently superior that many features questionable in the 2006 data are dealt with clearly .",
    "a roughly ring - like source is seen in all five wfpc2 bands , consistent with the same morphology throughout .",
    "we present the scaled median average from the redder three of the five bands ( f555w , f702w and f791w , with 4 , 2 and 2 sub - exposures apiece , summed by a cr - split algorithm ) in fig .  1",
    ". the pixel brightnesses actually increase moving out from the sn position out to a radius of 0.075 arcsec .",
    "the ring is not uniformly bright ; the peak in brightness occurs at pa 50@xmath12 .    by convolving an infinitesimally - thin annular ring of constant radius ( but not constant azimuthal brightness profile ) with the psf and minimizing the resultant @xmath13 of flux in the affected pixels",
    "once this ring is subtracted from the original image , we find a ring radius of 1.65 @xmath14 0.1 pixels @xmath15 0.075 @xmath14 0.005 arcsec . at a distance to m100 of 15.2 mpc ( freedman et al .",
    "2001 ) , this corresponds to a radius of 5.5 pc ( or 18.0 light - years ) . since the foreground distance @xmath16 in front of the sn of light echoing material a radius @xmath6 ( perpendicular to the sightline ) at time @xmath5 after sn maximum light is given by    @xmath17    which for this echo implies @xmath18 light - year ( or 26.3 pc ) at @xmath19  y after sn maximum light , with an average scattering angle of 12@xmath12 .",
    "the natural fwhm of this interstellar echo annulus , due to the duration of the maximum light peak , is at least 0.6 light - year , and probably thicker due to the finite thickness of the reflecting dust layer , but we can not constrain this at a useful level due to the angular resolution limits of @xmath7/wfpc2 and the limited @xmath20 of the echo image .",
    "the spread in radius is fit poorly with a fwhm more than about 20% of the central value , hence a spread in @xmath16 of more than 40% , corresponding to 16 pc @xmath21 @xmath16 @xmath21 36 pc .",
    "there is little evidence in the 680d post - max morphology for a unresolved circumstellar source strongly suggested by w+08 .",
    "the pixel containing the sn position contains 3% of the total flux from the entire echo nebula ( in the redder three bands ) , but 21% of any hypothetical point source there .",
    "however , much brighter pixels centered 1 - 2 pixel widths away imply that 69% of this flux must come from a source outside the central pixel .",
    "the upper limit ( 3@xmath22 ) on a circumstellar source is therefore about 5% of the total flux of the nebula .",
    "we consider the lightcurve in the band in which the echo is best detected , f555w , which is common to both acs and wfpc2 images . for day",
    "87 post - max we detect no deviation ( over @xmath23 ) from the the stellar psf for sn 2006x , so adopt the entire flux for the sn point - source value , @xmath24 . for day 680 post - max , the echo nebulosity has @xmath25 of which a central point source is less than 5% , or @xmath26 , implying that the extended echo itself has @xmath27 . in the case of day 304 post - max , the sn@xmath2echo signal corresponds to @xmath28 . subtracting the sn central point source yields @xmath29 , to within @xmath300.1 mag error due to subtraction systematics , and hence a sn @xmath31 .",
    "this echo magnitude is in good agreement with the 680d post - max echo , as well as that found by w+08 for 304d post - max .",
    "there is no evidence of any change in the echo brightness between 304d and 680d post - maximum ; indeed the data is inconsistent with any change larger than @xmath3010% .",
    "these photometric results are summarized in fig .  2 , along with various comparison @xmath9 values from ground - based photometry of sn 2006x and other normal sne ia .",
    "assuming that normal sne ia have no significant circumstellar echoes 304 or 670d after maximum , there is also no evidence that sn 2006x does , either .",
    "we have compiled a library of many epochs of sn 2006x spectra taken at mdm observatory ( crotts et al .",
    "2008 ) and use this to compare synthetic magnitudes for the fluence of sn light in the @xmath7 bands to the actual echo flux seen in these bands .",
    "a best fit reflectance function to the extended echo , for the f380w , f439w , f555w , f702w and f791w bands , corresponds to @xmath32 for a power - law in wavelength ( with an error of @xmath33 in the exponent ) .",
    "such reflectance wavelength dependence is consistent with galactic dust of @xmath34 m radius ( e.g. , sugerman 2003 ) but not smaller dust ( large cut off at 0.01@xmath35 m or 0.1@xmath35 m ) .",
    "the echo has exceptionally high surface brightness ( @xmath36 ) , indicating @xmath37 values through the echoing cloud of at least a few ( as per sugerman 2003 , assuming mrn - like dust , and depending on the exact scattering phase function adopted ) .",
    "wang et al .  ( 2008a ) estimate the host extinction value as @xmath38 mag , so this strongly suggests that this interstellar echo arises from the primary source of extinction along the line of sight .",
    "magellan / mike 6-km s@xmath39 resolution spectra of sn 2006x taken on feb .",
    "13.35 and 23.25 ut show unusually strong absorption lines in na i , ca ii , k i and the cn b - x ( 0,0 ) violet bands ( lauroesch et al .  2006 , see also patat et al .",
    "2007 , hereafter p+07 , for comparable data ) .",
    "the na i @xmath405889 equivalent width is @xmath41  and heavily saturated ( and composed of at least two components , due to line asymmetry ) , and the cn r(0 ) 387.46-nm line has an equivalent width ( 0.09 ) , stronger than any published strength through galactic interstellar clouds .",
    "based on galactic expectation e.g. , crutcher ( 1985 ) , one should expect @xmath42 .",
    "these lines ( at @xmath43 km s@xmath39 ) are redshifted 72 km s@xmath39 versus the m100 centroid , consistent with the value of the galaxy s rotation curve at this point .",
    "the echo , absorption strengths and velocities of these features are all consistent with a single origin in the galaxy s disk , suggesting that the sn 2006x progenitor sits @xmath3026 pc behind the disk .",
    "there are several pieces of evidence suggesting a circumstellar absorption - line component or echo feature in front of sn 2006x , most notably time - variable na i absorption lines in high - resolution spectroscopy ( p+07 ) , which we discuss momentarily .    our analysis above places strong limits on the brightness of any circumstellar echo 680d post - max",
    "; furthermore is shows that there is no evidence of a circumstellar echo 304d post - max , and implies that any such echo likely has @xmath44 . on the basis of the difference between the resolved echo brightness 304d post - maximum and a sn maximum - like spectrum detected one month earlier ( 274d post - max ) , w+08 claim a circumstellar component to the echo which is @xmath45 times as bright as the @xmath46 interstellar echo . at 680d after maximum , any such component must have dimmed to @xmath26 , or at least 2.6 mag fainter .",
    "even if the echo paraboloid encounters no material after 274d post - max , the echo could dim no more than 8 mag by 680d post - max .",
    "( one can assume that the echoing dust , at least @xmath47 cm from the sn , is not destroyed . )",
    "thus the circumstellar material might extend at undiminished density beyond the 274d@xmath15 0.75y paraboloid by another 0.6y , corresponding to a total radius of 0.68 light - year for material directly behind the sn as seen from earth , or 1.35 light - year ( = @xmath48 cm ) radius , 90@xmath12 to one side .",
    "the detection of a circumstellar component ( w+08 ) is only a @xmath49 result , however , and this confidence estimate does not include several likely significant sources of systematic error . there is no evidence from the @xmath7 imaging sample that supports the existence of a circumstellar echo , and indeed this component is limited to a value of only @xmath3010% of the total echo at day 304 post - maximum , not the 60% ( @xmath1430% ) reported by w+08 for day 274 .",

    "both p+07 and chugai ( 2008 ) discuss the relative merits of a circumstellar versus interstellar origins of the time - variable na i absorption components , especially considering the possible small - scale structure that might arise in such a thick interstellar cloud as the one seen at 26 pc distance , due to motion of the source against foreground absorption .",
    "the imaging and photometric data presented here has little constraint on such ism structure ( at the @xmath59 cm level ) , and if these absorption lines are circumstellar , they arise at radii @xmath60 cm where the light echo data similarly have little bearing .",
    "in conclusion , the @xmath7 imaging 87 , 304 and 680d after v - band maximum say little about circumstellar material closer than about @xmath61 cm . as in the case of sn 1991 t and 1995e , no central source corresponding to a circumstellar structure , echoing or not , has ever been detected .",
    "in contrast , sn 1998bu shows a central source that has been interpreted as a circumstellar echo .",
