    "the cooling and trapping techniques of atoms , used in the realization of bec @xcite and degenerate fermi gases @xcite , have recently produced quantum bose - fermi mixtures of dilute atomic gases @xcite .",
    "motivated by the controllability of various experimental parameters such as trap geometries , particle numbers , and interaction strengths in experiments of the ultra - cold atoms , a number of theoretical studies have been done to explain various experimental results done for bose - fermi mixtures @xcite .",
    "further experimental advances have led to the realization of bec in quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) system @xcite , by putting atoms in cylindrical traps long enough that the one - particle energy - level spacing in radial direction exceeds the interatomic - interaction energy , and the atoms can move effectively in the axial direction .",
    "characteristic properties of the q1d bec have been demonstrated in the formation experiments of matter - wave solitons in repulsively / attractively interacting systems @xcite .",
    "also several new phenomena , which are typical in the q1d bose system , have been proposed theoretically : quasi - condensates with fluctuating phases @xcite and a tonks - girardeau gas of impenetrable bosons @xcite and so on .    in electric conductors ,",
    "the q1d systems have been realized in systems where electric currents can flow easier in one specific crystal direction than in the vertical directions @xcite .",
    "one of the most fascinating phenomena in such a system is the `` peierls instability '' : a lattice distortion with the period of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this instability gives rise to a charge - density wave in the ground state , a collective state of electrons , which is caused by the strong correlations among electrons due to the phonon - electron interaction .",
    "the origin of the effect is the divergence in phonon spectrum by the low - energy particle - hole ( p - h ) excitations near fermi surface with the wave - number @xmath0 , which give large contribution in phonon self - energy because of a phase - space reduction in q1d systems .    in the present paper ,",
    "we investigate the occurrence of the peierls instability in the q1d uniform system of atomic - gas bose - fermi mixture at @xmath2 .",
    "different from conductors that have the periodic structures by lattices , it have no periodic structures originally , and the instability and the periodic structure in the ground state is brought purely by the coupling between the bogoliubov - phonon mode of bosonic atoms and fermion p - h excitations .",

    "we show the calculated bosonic excitation spectra and that the peierls instability appears in collective excitation modes around the wave - number @xmath0 .",
    "the analytical estimations are also given for the collective excitation spectra . in section iv , we show that the state with periodic bec and the density - wave states for both boson and fermion ( with the period of @xmath1 ) is more stable than the uniform state . in section v , we briefly discuss the peierls instability in the finite q1d system confined in a ho potential @xcite .",

    "it should be noted that the matrix element eq .",
    "( [ eqme ] ) has a transition probability only in the spatial region where condensate exists .",
    "it is important at this point to contrast finite system to homogeneous system in which condensate is present all over the range .",
    "we restrict the present discussion into the parameter region : @xmath213 . under these conditions",
    ", we can take several approximations .",
    "because of @xmath214 , the system is in the thomas - fermi ( tf ) regime , so that we can take the tf approximation for the order - parameter : @xmath215 the @xmath216 in eq .",
    "( [ eqtf ] ) is a cut - off length in the tf approximation : @xmath217 where @xmath218 with @xmath219 ( the ho length in the axial direction ) .",
    "as we have seen in chapter iii , peierls instability comes from the coupling between the boson mode with wave - number near @xmath0 and the fermion p - h excitations near @xmath183 .",
    "although the wave - number is not strictly conserved in a ho potential , the instability mode would have wavenumber : @xmath220 .",
    "since the higher nodal modes @xmath221 have a broader spatial extension ( @xmath222 ) than a condensate one , the asymptotic expansions can be used for the @xmath206 in the middle of the trap @xmath223 @xcite : @xmath224 for a bosonic eigenstate with higher nodal mode , the negative energy amplitude @xmath225 of eq .",
    "( [ rpa1 ] ) can be neglected . using these approximations ,",
    "the matrix elements like @xmath226 become linear combinations of the form @xmath227 , where @xmath228 is the 1st - order bessel function and the @xmath229 is a wave - number difference between the initial and the finial states : @xmath230 . in the case of @xmath231 , using the asymptotic expansion of the bessel function , @xmath232 , the terms of @xmath233 can contribute to the matrix elements . under the restriction of wave - numbers @xmath234 and @xmath235 with @xmath236 ( @xmath237 ) , the main contributions of matrix element are from the scattering processes : @xmath238 and @xmath239 . to make an estimate ,",
    "we replace a product of bessel functions as @xmath240 and take the continuum - limit for the wave - number sums : @xmath241 .",
    "finally , the eigenenergy for a collective state with the wave number @xmath242 can be obtained @xmath243 contrary to the uniform system , the static polarization potential , the second term of right hand side of eq.([ee ] ) , is not divergent at @xmath0 .",
    "this is because the scattering of trapped atoms without wave - number conservation smears a singularity due to a sharp fermi sea .",
    "the peierls instability occurs where the polarization energy is overcome by the kinetic energy @xmath244 : @xmath245 where @xmath246 .",
    "this is the peierls instability condition where boson - fermion density wave may occur .",
    "we roughly estimate the parameters according to experimental conditions .",
    "when @xmath247 , we can express the velocity ratio and the dimensionless coupling constant by @xmath248 as a possible candidate for the peierls instability , we take the rubidium isotope system : @xmath249rb@xmath250rb mixtures . taking the scattering lengths in @xcite , @xmath251 and @xmath252 and the typical trapping frequencies , @xmath253 and @xmath254 , eq .",
    "( [ pic ] ) gives @xmath255 and @xmath256 for the realization of the peierls instability .",
    "in the present paper , we studied the occurrence of peierls instability in q1d bose - fermi mixtures at zero temperature .",
    "we analyzed the bosonic collective - excitation spectra in random phase approximation .",
    "it shows that the mixtures of uniform bec and a fermi gas are unstable against a spontaneous formation of a collective mode of wave - number @xmath0 ; this type of instability is known as peierls instability .",
    "this result suggests that the ground state of bosons is a periodic condensate with the period @xmath1 . in the variational method",
    ", the boson - fermion density wave state have been shown to have a lower energy than the uniform state .",
    "we also expanded our analysis for systems in an axial harmonic oscillator potential and derived peierls instability condition .",
    "it is well known that density waves in q1d conductors lead to generations of a lee - rice - anderson @xcite and a phase soliton @xcite modes .",
    "thus , studies of the dynamical properties of boson - fermion density waves should be interesting problems in future .",
