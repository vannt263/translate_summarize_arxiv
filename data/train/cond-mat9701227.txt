    "the slave boson technique has frequently been applied to the study of strong correlation effects in metals@xcite . in the high - t@xmath0 cuprate superconductors",

    "qualitatively , the comparison is excellent : the latter calculations have confirmed slave boson predictions@xcite that ( 1 ) correlations preserve a fermi - liquid - like energy dispersion , but renormalize the bandwidth ( ` flat bands')@xcite ; ( 2 ) a mott transition to an insulating phase can only occur at exactly half filling , when the bare cu - o energy splitting @xmath2 is larger than a critical value @xmath3 ( compare refs . @xcite and @xcite ) .",

    "the usual slave boson technique does not incorporate the magnetic effects which are important near half filling .",
    "this may be phenomenologically remedied by including the lowest - order correction in @xmath4 , producing a three - band tj model@xcite .",
    "a finite @xmath5 leads to a small reduction in @xmath3 , thereby improving agreement with qmc calculations .",
    "the present paper utilizes the three - band tj model to explore the role of van hove singularity ( vhs ) nesting in the cuprates .",
    "it is found that vhs nesting provides a natural explanation for the occurence of striped phases , composed of a magnetic - dominated regime near half - filling and a charge - dominated regime near optimal doping .",
    "the model is found to give a good description of the observed pseudogap formation in these materials , as well as to explain why the charged stripes are pinned near the vhs .",
    "in a recent survey of the van hove scenario@xcite , it was pointed out that there are actually two variants of the scenario , a _",
    "simple _ and a _ generalized _ scenario .",
    "the simple scenario explores the role of a peak in the density of states ( dos ) on the normal state and superconducting properties , ignoring any possible role of competing instabilities . in the extended scenario , these competing instabilities  predominantly spin or charge density waves  play an essential role , which can lead to the suppression of the superconducting instability .",
    "prior slave boson calculations had shown that correlation effects ( a large on - site coulomb repulsion , @xmath6 ) tend to pin the fermi level near the vhs over an extended doping range@xcite , and this has since been confirmed by a number of different techniques@xcite .",
    "it was suggested that nesting of the vhs s would lead to density wave instabilities which could successfully compete with superconductivity .",
    "this was modelled@xcite in a one - band tight - binding model , where the pinning was approximated by adjusting the fermi surface curvature such that the fermi level was exactly at the vhs for all dopings .",
    "the resulting density wave - superconducting phase diagram is in good agreement with the experimentally observed pseudogap transition vs. doping@xcite .",
    "clearly , such a model is oversimplified .",
    "strong correlation effects tend to suppress electron - phonon coupling near half filling , suggesting that the density wave must cross over from spin - density - wavelike near half filling to charge - density wavelike near optimal doping . whether such a crossover could be adequately described in a one - band model was not at all clear .    in the present paper , a self - consistent three - band tj model calculation",

    "since both are aspects of a single transition , both disappear at the same pseudogap transition temperature , as found experimentally .",

    "[ fig:13 ] can be understood in terms of the evolution of the shape of the fermi surface with doping .",
    "the vhs is pinned by correlation and phase separation effects near the fermi surface ; this pinning means that the shape of the fermi surface must evolve with doping , being square at half filling , and curved in such a way as to accomodate more holes as doping increases . since the pseudogap is associated with nesting , it dominates near half filling , when the nesting is perfect .",
    "away from half filling , the nesting is worse , so the pseudogap and pseudogap transition temperature both rapidly decrease with doping .",
    "superconductivity requires a large dos , but is insensitive to nesting ; moreover , it can arise on those sections of fermi surface which survive the imperfect nesting . for both of these reasons",
    ", the superconducting transition temperature grows with increasing doping , until it is comparable to the density wave transition .    within the model ,",
    "the pseudogap arises from a structural or magnetic instability  actually , there is a crossover between the two effects with increased underdoping .",
    "neither has any direct relation with superconductivity , except that they compete with it for the large dos associated with the vhs .",
    "superconductivity first arises in the model from the leftover dos associated with parts of the fermi surface away from the vhs .",
    "this is illustrated in the one - band model calculation of fig .",
    "[ fig:14 ] , which shows how the electronic dispersion , in the presence of a density wave gap , is modified by the appearence of a superconducting gap .",
    "[ for simplicity , an s - wave gap is assumed , rather than the more realistic d - wave gap . ] in this figure , the hole - like parts of the fermi surface ( dotted lines ) are ghosts , with the intensity suppressed by coherence factors , and will not be observed by photoemission .",
    "the solid lines in this figure should be compared to the dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] .",
    "the main difference is the superconducting gap away from the vhs  mainly near the hole pockets at @xmath192 , although there is a weak superconducting contribution to the gap at the vhs .",
    "thus , unlike fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] , in the presence of a superconducting gap , the dos will vanish at the fermi level .      hence , in the present model , the smaller photoemission gap near the fermi level is a composite object , due in part to superconductivity but also in part to the density wave gap .",
    "this explains why a gap persists near @xmath132 in the pseudogap regime above the superconducting @xmath165 .",
    "however , at @xmath165 there should be subtle changes in the form of the gap  in particular above @xmath165 , the density wave gaps should vanish in a finite portion of the brillouin zone near @xmath192 .",
    "the present model would predict a scaling of the superconducting part of the gap with @xmath165 , and hence with @xmath193@xcite .",
    "evidence for such a gap feature is found in neutron scattering measurements of the magnetic susceptibility near @xmath194 , which see a spin gap followed by a resonance peak , both of which features scale with @xmath165@xcite .",
    "such a spin gap follows from bcs theory . to be consistent with fig .",
    "[ fig:14 ] , the susceptibility must be associated with scattering between sections of fermi surface near @xmath192 which are not gapped by the density wave order .    within the present model , the issue of _ overdoping _ can be briefly addressed . from the free energy curves of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , it appears that the system will continue to evolve in a uniform paramagnetic phase for doping beyond the phase separated regime .",
    "however , the free energy has a local minimum near optimal doping , which is likely to be enhanced by the difficulty of adding additional holes to the cuo@xmath73 planes .",
    "hence , there may well be another phase with lower free energy , probably associated with doping holes off of the planes ( perhaps onto the apical o s and cu - d@xmath195 s ) in this doping range .",

    "experimental evidence for a second phase separation in the overdoped regime is summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite , section 11.6 .",

    "<S> slave boson calculations have been carried out in the three - band tj model for the high - t@xmath0 cuprates , with the inclusion of coupling to oxygen breathing mode phonons . </S>",
    "<S> phonon - induced van hove nesting leads to a phase separation between a hole - doped domain and a ( magnetic ) domain near half filling , with long - range coulomb forces limiting the separation to a nanoscopic scale . </S>",
    "<S> strong correlation effects pin the fermi level _ close to _ , but not precisely at the van hove singularity ( vhs ) , which can enhance the tendency to phase separation .    </S>",
    "<S> the resulting dispersions have been calculated , both in the uniform phases and in the phase separated regime . in the latter case , </S>",
    "<S> distinctly different dispersions are found for large , random domains and for regular ( static ) striped arrays , and a hypothetical form is presented for _ dynamic _ striped arrays . </S>",
    "<S> the doping dependence of the latter is found to provide an excellent description of photoemission and thermodynamic experiments on pseudogap formation in underdoped cuprates . in particular , the multiplicity of observed gaps is explained as a combination of flux phase plus charge density wave ( cdw ) gaps along with a superconducting gap . </S>",
    "<S> the largest gap is associated with vhs nesting . </S>",
    "<S> the apparent smooth evolution of this gap with doping masks a crossover from cdw - like effects near optimal doping to magnetic effects ( flux phase ) near half filling . </S>",
    "<S> a crossover from large fermi surface to hole pockets with increased underdoping is found . in the weakly overdoped regime , </S>",
    "<S> the cdw undergoes a quantum phase transition ( @xmath1 ) , which could be obscured by phase separation . </S>"
