    "this led to a drift of about 2 - 4@xmath49 during individual exposures , giving both poor wavelength calibration and very poor background subtraction ( e.g. , it is quite plausible that the flux is indeed zero below 1290 ) . in addition , the spectra are normalized to the entire exposure time , giving the spectrum an artificially low apparent flux , since the region extracted was exposed only for a shorter time due to drift .",
    "however , this object has the highest _ galex _ broadband flux levels of any of our previously unexplored targets , and has both nuv and fuv detections at @xmath74 .",
    "the actual uv continuum spectral flux is possibly about a factor of 5 - 10 higher than what is shown in fig . 2c .",
    "its literature redshift is somewhat uncertain , with @xcite identifying only a single strong line as ly@xmath2 , and deriving @xmath18 from this .",
    "they implicitly adopt a statistical uncertainty of at least @xmath75 , which we use to mark our uv spectrum , showing that the break we see is indeed consistent with ly@xmath2 .",
    "this object is therefore tentatively another new quasar , although we conservatively mark it as uncertain in table 3 and include it only as euv bright in subsequent discussion .",
    "additionally , figure 3 shows our acs / sbc prism spectra of sdss  1614 + 4859 at @xmath29 and oq172 at @xmath30 .",
    "both these quasars are recovered in our sdss/_galex _ catalogs of section 2 ( and paper i ) , and both have earlier but modest s / n _ hst _ uv spectra published in the literature .",
    "we were motivated by the intriguing results of @xcite in a similar redshift range of @xmath76 to obtain acs / sbc prism uv spectra of these two quasars with improved s / n near ly@xmath2 .",
    "sdss  1614 + 4859 was first identified by @xcite as a new clean quasar ; our improved s",
    "/ n acs / sbc spectrum shows that it is indeed a very clean sightline , with a marked sharp break at the expected location of ly@xmath2 .",
    "oq172 @xcite was amongst the earliest _ hst _ targets considered and rejected as a gunn - peterson target ; again our higher @xmath66 acs / sbc spectrum ( figure 3 ) affirms earlier conclusions , with strong absorption ( probably due to ) redward of the expected break location . with the availability of these directly comparable acs / sbc spectra , we are able to also include these two individually interesting cases , where suitable , in the following ensemble considerations (",
    "although , for example , exclude them from selection efficiency statistics ) .    finally , we note that in the remaining discussions we have uniformly re - reduced all the similar acs / sbc prism data available for a total of 33 euv bright quasars ; these prism spectra collectively come from @xcite , paper i , and this paper .",
    "these updated and uniform re - reductions also allow us further confidence in the helium character of one additional quasar , sdss  1319 + 5202 , from paper i. we now include this quasar as an additional break confirmation ( whereas in paper i , we had labeled it as an uncertain case ) , because although it does have some redward absorption , there is a sharp , strong break at ly@xmath2 evident in our current reductions .",
    "the high success rate of our cycle 16 supplemental _ hst _ observations reported here in confirming new euv - bright quasars ( @xmath77% ) and in finding new quasars ( @xmath78% with breaks , and",
    "@xmath79% very clean down to ) again demonstrates the value of our quasar/_galex _ cross - correlation catalogs ( see also paper i ) . although our new _",
    "hst _ targets were not randomly selected , the few - month visibility constraints of _ hst _ cycle 16 supplemental , combined with the large number of targets , means that the sample discussed herein is somewhat representative of our ( sdss/_galex _ ) catalog as a whole .",
    "although we preferred higher quality ( absence of lls or dla in the sdss spectrum , for example ) targets for the _ hst _ observations , we also pushed to high redshift ( in several cases @xmath80 ) , and for targets at a variety of redshifts , since we seek a sample to characterize the redshift evolution of absorption . to some degree ,",
    "these two selection effects tend to cancel one another .",
    "it should also be noted that our _ hst _ reconnaissance targets were selected from the @xmath81 subset of the targets listed in tables [ tab : targetlistsdss ] and [ tab : targetlistveron ] .",
    "lower redshift targets are more likely to be true matches , given their systematically higher flux and lower chance of intervening absorption systems , on average .",
    "thus our @xmath82% prism spectra success rate ( for @xmath81 uv - bright objects ) is not incompatible with the predicted @xmath83% rate ( for @xmath0 objects ) found in section 2 by matching offset catalogs .    when considering the full reconnaissance sample , also including paper i results , we have observed with _",
    "hst _ a total of 39 new targets that also are in our current quasar/_galex _ cross - correlation catalogs ( tables 1 and 2 ) at offsets @xmath69 . of these ,",
    "27 ( 69% ) are confirmed with _",
    "hst _ as euv bright , with at least 22 ( 56% ) having ly@xmath2 breaks , and at least 19 ( 49% ) being clean sightlines .",
    "( here we do not include the two previously considered uv - bright quasars , sdss  1614 + 4859 and oq172 , discussed in section 3 .",
    "we also do not include quasars with @xmath68 , of which we have three : two of our quasars confirmed in paper i , and one undetected target from the cycle 16 supplemental program .",
    "however , if included , they have little effect on the actual percentages . )    using the 39 _ hst_-observed targets with @xmath69 , we may also re - examine the efficacy of our chosen quasar/_galex _ match radius in light of the actual results of our acs / sbc prism observations .",
    "as one would expect , those objects verified to be uv bright from _ hst _ tend to have smaller offsets between their sdss and _ galex _ positions , but this effect is not large .",
    "for example , for the @xmath69 sample , geometrically 50% of random points should be at @xmath84 . in practice",
    ", that region contains 68% of our non - detections , and 85% of our detections .",
    "the appearance that the two sets of offset distances are different , but not substantially so , is quantified by a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test .",
    "this shows that the two sets of positional offsets have a 12% chance of being drawn from the same distribution .",
    "we thus verify our 3@xmath49 offset limit a reasonable compromise between contamination and inclusiveness ( since euv - bright @xmath0 quasars are still quite rare ) .      for our own primary science interests related to ionized helium in the igm ,",
    "a major result of this paper is the end - to - end selection and spectral verification of 12 new break quasars ( table 3 ; all are from sdss/_galex_/_hst _ ) .",
    "we find clean sightlines , with no obvious absorption redward of ly@xmath2 , in 10 of these 12 quasars .",
    ", may be of relatively marginal quality for follow - up",
    ". however , note that sdssj1341 + 0756 , despite an intervening lls , has residual continuum flux comparable with several of our fainter apparently clean sightlines .",
    "we can not rule out lls in the region between _ hst _ and sdss spectra , @xmath3618503800  ( observed ) , and this may indeed explain the faintness of some of our objects . ]",
    "our approximately 34% selection efficiency for clean quasars in the current paper is again an order of magnitude better than most previous searches ( which typically had yields of order 3 - 6% ) .",
    "our improved s / n acs / sbc prism observations also strongly affirm the @xcite conclusion that sdss  1614 + 4598 is an excellent , clean , helium quasar sightline to @xmath29 .",
    "our acs / sbc prism spectra of sdss  1614 + 4859 ( this paper ) and sdss  1137 + 6237 ( paper i ) provide further evidence that the strong absorption redward of seen in the uv spectrum toward sdss  1711 + 6052 ( another quasar at similar redshift ) is  as argued by @xcite for other reasons  unlikely to be a universal ( and unexpectedly strong ) signature of igm helium reionization .",
    "the ten new clean quasars selected and verified herein , together with the nine such confirmed quasars from paper i and the earlier sdss/_hst _ confirmations of @xcite quintuple the sample of clean sightlines suitable for igm helium studies .",
    "these 21 clean quasar sightlines represent significant progress toward a statistical sample for the study of igm helium , spanning much of the redshift range during which reionization is expected to take place ( figure 1 ) .    with the beginnings of a statistical sample of and other euv - bright quasars , we perform preliminary stacks of our uv spectra in the quasar rest frame , to initially examine redshift evolution in three different redshift bins ( figure 4 ) .",
    "we use all 33 euv - bright acs / sbc quasar spectra from the current work , paper i , and the three earlier @xcite cases , and normalize each by its continuum flux in their acs / sbc prism spectra . using the ensemble of spectra ,",
    "we then calculate the median flux value at each wavelength , and bin to the prism resolution of the highest - redshift ( lowest - resolution ) quasar in each stack .",
    "we correct each individual - object prism spectrum for galactic reddening before stacking , using the analytical formulae of @xcite and the dust maps of @xcite .",
    "( we do not attempt to correct for other  e.g .",
    ", host galaxy  reddening , or aggregate low - column - density ly@xmath2 forest absorption , although these effects could be considered in a statistical sense ) .",
    "although individual features such as proximity zones , possible euv emission lines , and possible flux recoveries are important ( and will be analyzed in a future paper ) , the median stacks provide representative ensemble spectra unbiased by a few high s / n cases or by the selection or rejection of particular objects one might consider in mean stacks .",
    "the redshift bins here are described in relative terms as low redshift ( @xmath85 ) , moderate redshift ( @xmath86 ) , and high redshift ( @xmath87 ) ; this choice of redshift bins is somewhat arbitrary , but allows stacking of 10 - 12 individual object prism spectra within each bin .    at the low acs / sbc prism resolution",
    ", there is little obvious evidence for dramatic evolution of these binned / median spectra with redshift .",
    "although several of the input objects have noteworthy absorption redward of the ly@xmath2 break , in many cases presumably due to low - redshift hydrogen , the median stack in each redshift bin has a clean break at ly@xmath2 .",
    "however , it may be notable that the high - redshift objects individually are more likely than either the low or moderate - redshift objects to have strong absorption redward of ly@xmath2 ; see @xcite for a discussion of several ideas about the origin of such absorption .",
    "further analysis of these and other combinations of stacked euv prism spectra is ongoing .",
    "however , a sensitive search for the predicted , more subtle , damped redward absorption profile of reionization will likely require quality , higher resolution follow - up uv spectra .",
    "our combined sample of more than twenty quasars , spanning a wide redshift range , provides a resource list for such studies , complementary to the ( mainly ) lower redshift cases emphasized in the studies of the historical quasars .",
    "although none of our new cases are as uv bright as the two most luminous and lowest - redshift ( @xmath88 ) historical quasars , hs  1700 + 6416 and he  2347 - 4342 , some do have far - uv flux comparable to the other two historically well - studied quasars , q0302 - 003 and pks  1935 - 692 .",
    "moreover , most of our new clean quasars have far - uv flux within an order of magnitude of q0302 - 003 and pks  1935 - 692 ( both at @xmath89@xmath14 ) , assuring that quality uv spectra are feasible in reasonable exposure times with the current generation of uv instruments ( cos or stis on the refurbished _ hst _ ) .",
    "the redshift span of our quasars will allow follow - up study spanning most of the reionization epoch .",
    "in closing the discussion section , we note that the far uv bright quasars verified in _ hst _",
    "reconnaissance may also find use in other ultraviolet studies , from low - redshift hi absorption to euv quasar emission lines and seds .",
    "for example , several euv - bright objects discussed herein appear to have intervening hydrogen absorption systems that , although optically thick , do not completely block all uv flux ; these may be of interest for the study of low - redshift lls .",
    "such low - redshift lls are likely found in the following quasars : _ 1026 + 3531 ( z=3.65)_this object has a clear ly@xmath2 break , but apparently also absorption due to",

    "( uncertainties quoted for the optical depths in this subsection are 68% confidence interval limits , and incorporate only random errors . ) the flux below the hydrogen lyman continuum break is estimated near that break , avoiding possible emission lines and the rise near ly@xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath93 flux recovery leads to a factor of @xmath94 recovery by the ly@xmath2 break .",
    "_ 1341 + 0756 ( z=3.30)_this object has a clear ly@xmath2 break , but also a dramatic break redward , perhaps due to hydrogen continuum absorption .",
    "this possible lls is at @xmath90 , and has a column density of roughly @xmath95  @xmath56 , based on an optical depth of @xmath96 .",

    "( z=3.54)_this object is oq172 discussed in section 3 , and targeted by @xcite with fos and found to have a strong flux break @xmath36100  ( observed ) redward of ly@xmath2 . our higher s / n spectrum ( fig .",
    "3 ) suggests that the flux break is very extended , and the spectrum is consistent with having residual flux down to ly@xmath2 ( the final break occurs a single pixel from the expected ly@xmath2 position , and thus within instrumental resolution ) .",
    "we concur with @xcite that the large flux break is due to a hydrogen lls at @xmath98 , finding a tentative column density of @xmath99  @xmath56 , based on an optical depth of @xmath100 .",

    ", our data can add no constraint at 1970 .",
    "in addition to absorption studies , two other aspects of our spectral stacks worth considering are related to euv quasar emission line and continuum radiation ; we also present some initial comments on these aspects as well .",
    "it is clear empirically ( though also known theoretically ) that ly@xmath2 emission does not dominate the quasar spectrum the way ly@xmath2 does  indeed , it scarcely seems present in the median stacks of figure 4 , though there appear to be individual exceptions to this rule ( e.g. , see sdss  1442 + 0920 in paper i ) .",
    "this result was empirically also seen in the better studied quasars with higher s / n spectra @xcite .",
    "( qso 1157 + 3143 @xcite is at @xmath19 , which means any ly@xmath2 from the quasar lies in a wavelength region difficult to observe due to geocoronal ly@xmath2 . )",
    "there are similarly no other very strong euv emission lines definitively present in our initial ensemble spectra . however , the acs / sbc ( low and non - linear ) prism resolution is not optimal for searches of subtle lines and blends , and individual objects again show some spectral diversity .    for constraints on the euv ( rest - frame )",
    "continua , we construct an ensemble spectral stack from our acs / sbc prism data , similar to figure 4 but now considering just the 13 objects with clean sightlines ( lacking any obvious hydrogen absorption in our acs prism spectra ) and with @xmath102 ( to maximize the range of continuum wavelengths sampled ) . for this preliminary result",

    "the ensemble continuum stack we assemble for these 13 quasars extends from 320  to 410  ( rest - frame ) .",
    "the upper limit comes from the redshift and instrument constraints , while the lower limit is chosen to avoid what appears to be a flux rise near ly@xmath2 , which is conceivably due to blended broad emission lines . from our reddening - corrected ensemble median stack ,",
    "we derive a preliminary euv slope of @xmath103 , for @xmath104 , which agrees with the euv quasar slope found by @xcite , who looked primarily at somewhat longer wavelengths .",

    "note that there is considerable diversity among individual objects , with individual euv slopes ranging from @xmath105 to @xmath106 .",
    "large diversity in slopes is also seen at longer uv wavelengths in optical ( observed - frame ) spectroscopy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the range we find may be even greater , perhaps due to a greater sensitivity of the euv region to intrinsic or host - galaxy reddening .",
    "( smc - like extinction , which might describe quasar host galaxies better than galactic extinction curves @xcite , rises even more sharply in the far - uv than does galactic extinction @xcite . ) in any case , such direct ensemble constraints on the quasar euv slope may find use in modelling igm reionization , as well as radiation emission and absorption processes internal to quasars themselves .",
    "utilizing recently expanded sky coverage from sdss dr7 and _ galex _ gr4 + 5 , we provide an expanded catalog of 428 sdss quasars at @xmath0 that are likely ( @xmath1 ) associated with _ galex _ ultraviolet sources , and thus bright in the euv ( rest - frame ) .",
    "these likely euv - bright quasars may find potential use for a variety of igm and quasar studies , from euv quasar sed continua , line emission , and intrinsic absorption lines , to probes of intervening at low redshift , as well as the authors own principal interest in the gunn - peterson test for the igm .",
    "our euv - bright quasar/_galex _ catalogs are two orders of magnitude larger than most previous similar dedicated efforts , and double the size of our own previous lists from paper i.    from our _ hst _ cycle 16 supplemental program , we herein also report new reconnaissance uv spectral observations with the acs / sbc prisms for 31 quasars , selected from our optical / uv catalogs to encompass a wide redshift range .",
