    "o stars dominate the x - ray emission from young clusters , with x - ray luminosities up to @xmath2 ergs s@xmath3 and emission that is hard ( typically several kev ) and often variable .",
    "this strong x - ray emission has an effect on these o stars environments , including nearby sites of star formation and protoplanetary disks surrounding nearby low - mass pre - main - sequence stars .",
    "the x - ray emission is also interesting in its own right , as it traces important high - energy processes in the extended atmospheres of o stars . in this paper",
    ", i will show how the spectral properties of the x - rays from the prototypical young , magnetized o star , @xmath1 are in line with the predictions of the magnetically channeled wind shock ( mcws ) model , but how this process seems to dissipate as o stars age , with weaker line - driven instability wind shocks explaining the x - ray emission in older o stars .",
    "i also will show how the x - ray emission can be used as a probe of the conditions in the bulk stellar winds of these objects .",
    "specifically , the resolved x - ray line profiles in normal o supergiants provide an independent line of evidence for reduced mass - loss rates .",
    "now , it is certainly the case that many young o stars do not show the x - ray signatures of the mcws mechanism . and indeed , only a handful of o and early b stars have had direct detections of magnetic fields . of course ,",
    "highly structured , non - dipole fields will be very difficult to detect on hot stars , even if their local strength is quite high .",
    "but one should keep in mind that wind - wind interactions in close binaries can also produce the hard , strong , and variable x - rays seen in many young o stars .    because @xmath1 has a well established , predominantly dipole field , and because many of its properties are explained by this field , i treat it here as a potential prototype .",
    "i also note that the incidence of hard , strong x - ray emission from o stars diminishes rapidly as one looks from young ( @xmath4 myr ) clusters to older ( 2 to 5 myr ) clusters .",
    "this fact can be explained if the fossil fields in young o stars dissipate as the stars age .",
    "if wind - wind binaries account for many of these sources , then only the very earliest o stars with very short lifetimes are involved .",
    "we begin the comparison of young and old o stars and their x - rays by showing in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] the _ chandra _ meg spectra of two representative stars : @xmath1 ( o4 - 7 v ) , with an age of @xmath0 myr , and @xmath5 pup ( o4 if ) , with an age of several myr , and already evolved well off the main sequence .",
    "the @xmath5 pup x - ray spectrum is typical of those measured for most o stars .",
    "( top ) and @xmath5 pup ( bottom ) .",
    "the hydrogen - like lyman alpha lines of si and mg are indicated in black , while the helium - like resonance - intercombination - forbidden complexes of the same elements are indicated in gray . ]",
    "two obvious differences between these spectra are the hardness of the x - ray emission from @xmath1 and the small line widths in that star s spectrum . the hardness implies a much higher plasma temperature in the young o star , and this is best seen in the data when one compares resonance lines of hydrogen - like and helium - like ionization states of abundant elements . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] i have labeled these lines for silicon and magnesium . in @xmath6",
    "the hydrogen - like lines are much stronger , whereas in @xmath5 pup the helium - like lines are stronger .",
    "this reflects a significantly different ionization balance in these two stars which is a direct effect of their different plasma temperatures .",
    "the plasma temperature distribution , based on the analysis of high - resolution _ chandra _ spectra of several o stars , has been determined by wojdowski & schulz ( 2005 ) .",
    "these authors assume a continuous differential emission measure ( dem ) , which can be thought of as a density - squared weighting of the plasma temperature distribution .",
    "their results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dem ] , where it can easily be seen that the dem for @xmath1 is the only one ( of seven o stars ) with a positive slope .",

    "a rising dem up to and beyond 10 million k  matches the data well .",

    "[ fig : mhd ] .",
    "it can be seen that the bulk of the shock - heated plasma is in the magnetically confined region near @xmath8 . due to this confinement , the speed and line - of - sight velocity of this material is low , and thus the emission lines from the thermal x - ray emission are relatively narrow .",

    "[ fig : line_profiles ] , where i show the neon ly@xmath10 lines for the two stars .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of @xmath5 pup is also soft , as i have already shown .",
    "the x - ray emission from these older , presumably non - magnetized , o stars is thought to arise in much milder wind shocks , embedded in the outflowing , highly supersonic line - driven winds . the line - driven instability ( ldi ) is generally thought to produce these shocks , although models have difficulty reproducing the overall level of x - ray emission unless the instability is seeded , perhaps by sound waves injected at the base of the wind ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* feldmeier et al . , 1997 ) ) .",
    "the softness of the x - ray spectra , along with the large line widths from the high velocity of the shock - heated wind , is well explained by this ldi wind - shock scenario , as i show in fig.[fig : vh1 ] .",

    "this shape , with a deficit of red - shifted photons , arises in a spherically expanding wind with hot , line - emitting material intermixed with warm , continuum - absorbing material , as motivated by the global structure seen in fig.[fig : vh1 ] . if the wind is optically thick ( in the continuum ; @xmath12 constant across a line ) , then there is significantly more attenuation of emission from the back of the wind , which is the red shifted portion . and there is comparatively more emission from the front , blue shifted , less attenuated , side . in fig.[fig : profile_schematic ] i show a schematic demonstrating a simple , empirical wind line profile model that i use to fit the data .",
    "i fit an empirical model ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* owocki & cohen , 2001 ) ) to emission lines in the spectrum of @xmath5 pup and get good fits by adjusting only three parameters : the normalization , the inner radius below which there is assumed to be no emission ( @xmath13 ) , and the wind optical depth ( parameterized by the quantity @xmath14 ) .",
    "the fit to the fe xvii line at 15.014   is typical and is shown in fig .",

    "fit residuals for the two models are shown in the lower panel , with the red circles corresponding to the low optical depth model represented by the dashed histogram , and the blue squares corresponding to the higher optical depth model . ]",
    "the @xmath13 derived from the profile is consistent with the onset of the self - excited instability seen in the hydrodynamics simulation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vh1 ] .",
    "the optical depth consistent with the data is actually quite small , which can be seen qualitatively in the relatively modest asymmetry .",

    "thus it would appear that the x - ray line profiles provide independent evidence that mass - loss rates of o stars must be revised downward by a factor of several ; a factor of 4 for this star , according to this particular line ( @xmath20 vs.  @xmath17 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that porosity associated with large - scale clumping  rather than reduced mass - loss rates  can account for the surprisingly small degree of asymmetry in the observed x - ray emission line profiles in o stars ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* oskinova et al . , 2006 ) ) . by fitting the line profile model , modified for the effects of porosity produced by",

    "the best - fit porous model with the literature mass - loss rate is nearly indistinguishable from the best - fit non - porous model , although the fit quality is formally not as good .",
    "more importantly , it requires a terminal porosity length ( the value of @xmath24 in the outer portion of the wind ) of at least @xmath25 r@xmath26 ( 68% confidence ) , as shown in the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:2fits_porous ] . even ignoring the worse quality of the porous model fits , the very high values of the porosity length required to fit the data",
