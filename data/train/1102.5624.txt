    "this is the case , for example , when investigating atoms in microcavities  @xcite or elongated magneto - optical traps  @xcite , heavy nuclei  @xcite , coupled spins on a lattice  @xcite or calculating the entropy of a black hole  @xcite .    in all physical problems listed above the system",

    "the last assumption does not lead to the loss of generality , because we can always shift the excitations up or down to ensure that the lowest mode has zero excitation . in many applications ,",
    "we have @xmath8 ( e.g.  lattice spins or harmonic traps ) or @xmath9 ( square potential wells ) .    the control parameter for which we calculate the sum of states is defined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number of particles occupying mode @xmath12 and ( in the case of degenerate modes ) its submode @xmath13 , subject to the constraint @xmath14 the number of physical states of @xmath1 particles realizing a given @xmath15 is called the sum of states @xmath16 .",

    "for the sake of generality , we call @xmath15 a total excitation .    the paper concerns with the calculation of @xmath16 for noninteracting classical , bosonic or fermionic particles occupying a finite number of modes with arbitrary spacings .",
    "first , we investigate exact ( the popular recursive and proposed iterative ) expressions for the marginal or cumulative sum of states , which are useful in practical calculations . exploiting a probabilistic analogy ,",
    "we then obtain an analytic fourth - order approximation to the normalized sum of states ( density of states ) @xmath18 , which captures its mean , variance and kurtosis .",
    "the approximation is extended to an analytic - numerical scheme which can also match the skewness of @xmath18 and is better suited to handle excitation spectra with strongly non - homogeneous densities .",
    "we demonstrate numerically that our analytic approximation is superior to the previous ones ( the gaussian one and its polynomial corrections fitted also to the kurtosis  e.g .",
    "@xcite ) and matches closely the exact sum of states for all three particle statistics . additionally , our approach employs a simple _ exact _ method of calculating the moments of the microcanonical density of states for quantum particles , which requires less computational effort than the commonly used saddle - point approximation ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we discuss the applications of our methods to different physical systems pointing out their advantages over commonly employed approaches .",
    "we begin by reviewing the known recursive exact expressions for the sum of states of classical and quantum noninteracting particles  @xcite , and proceed later to derive their iterative counterparts .",
    "the total excitation of @xmath1 particles distributed among @xmath2 modes is defined by  .",
    "if the mode @xmath3 ( degenerate or not ) is occupied by @xmath20 particles , than the remaining excitation @xmath21 can be redistributed among the @xmath22 particles in @xmath23 ways , where the factor @xmath24 accounts for the particle statistics . on the other hand ,",
    "if the mode @xmath3 is @xmath25-degenerate , the @xmath20 particles occupying it can be reshuffled in @xmath26 ways  @xcite .",
    "hence , we have the recursive expression @xmath27 where @xmath28 the boundary condition for @xmath19 is @xmath29    for many values of @xmath20 the factor @xmath30 will be zero , because @xmath20 will be either too high or too low .",
    "thus , it makes sense to derive tighter bounds for the range of summation over @xmath20 . for",

    "equation   is modified to @xmath41    the remaining question is the definition of @xmath38 for fermions , for which it should be higher due to the pauli exclusion principle . in principle , we can derive an inequality similar to  , but it would be tedious to use , as it would depend on the excitation values of multiple modes @xmath42 .",
    "however , we can safely use the @xmath38 as defined for bosons and classical particles   when dealing with fermions , at the cost of summing over a larger number of zero values .    for classical particles",
    ", we can also use recursion in the number of particles , not in the number of modes , writing @xmath43 with the same boundary condition as before .",
    "this formula holds an advantage over  , because it does not require the evaluation of factorials .",
    "we define the cumulative sum of states as the number of states with total excitation less than or equal to @xmath15 , @xmath44 . to distinguish between the two quantities , the previously defined sum of states @xmath16",
    "can also be called the _ marginal _ sum of states .",

    "this means that the excitation values @xmath49 and @xmath15 must be discretized , which for irregular excitation values leads to large memory requirements . on the other hand , they do not iterate over every configuration of the system , avoiding the problem of the exponential growth of their total number .        in certain applications ,",
    "it is necessary to have access to each of the system configurations counted by the sum of states .",
    "for this purpose , the recursive formulas can be converted to an explicit iterative expression for the sum of states : @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the factor @xmath54 is the number of particle states realizing a given combination @xmath55 .",
    "equation   provides a simple way to sum over all combinations of @xmath56 , subject to the constraints @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and takes into account the mode degeneracies .",
    "again , the difference between the formulas for bosons and fermions amounts to excluding , in the latter case , all combinations where at least one @xmath59 .",
    "the difference between @xmath16 and @xmath44 is the relaxation of constraint   when calculating the latter .",
    "hence , we can easily write an iterative exact formula for it , similar to  , @xmath60 the other conditions and definitions remain unchanged .",
    "formulas for the sum of states  ,   and  , though accurate , are not very convenient for analytic calculations",
    ". we will now derive two analytic approximations for @xmath16 ( more precisely , for its version @xmath61 normalized to unity ) , by exploiting an analogy between a system of classical / quantum independent particles and a set of independent / correlated random variables .",

    "given the values of the mean , variance and kurtosis of @xmath70 , we can use the gaussian or fourth - order approximation for @xmath1 independent fermionic or bosonic particles .",
    "however , the computation of these quantities is not as easy as for classical particles , because the particles excitations can not be identified with independent random variables , due to their quantum nature . for example , given a system of two bosons which can occupy states 0 and 1 , the joint probability distribution of their excitations in the microcanonical ensemble is given by the table    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the distribution in the second table is identical to the one in the first table , with @xmath108 corresponding to configuration ( 0,0 ) , @xmath109 to configurations ( 1,0 ) or ( 0,1 ) , and @xmath110 to ( 1,1 ) .",

    "the starting conditions are @xmath127 and @xmath128 . unlike in the case of classical particles ,",
    "the above approximation requires a recursive numerical calculation .",
    "however , this calculation is less onerous than the one in  , as we do not loop over @xmath15 values .",
    "additionally , our exact method of calculating the moments @xmath125 is much simpler than the commonly used non - exact approach , which requires the approximation of the microcanonical density of states using the canonical or grand canonical density of states and saddle - point approximation  @xcite .",
    "we test the approximation in the case of a 1d harmonic oscillator potential , for which @xmath73 and @xmath8 ( equal mode spacings ) . in the case of bosons ,",
    "the approximation agrees well with exact results ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ht1d - bose ] ) .     and @xmath129 modes . ]",
    "similar results were obtained for fermions .",
    "figure  [ fig : ht1d - cmp ] compares the results of the approximation for different particle statistics , showing how important it is to include the effect of quantum indistinguishability and especially the pauli principle ( which is omitted by e.g.  the bethe formula used to describe the sum of states of nuclear spins  @xcite ) . in the tests for non - equal mode spacings",
    "the proposed approximation is at least as good as the gaussian one .     and @xmath129 modes . ]",
    "the formula   describes a symmetric sum of states function .",
    "thus , our approximation will not work too well for systems with strongly non - homogeneous excitation spectra , where the dependence of the sum of states on @xmath15 is strongly skewed , e.g.  with @xmath130 for @xmath131 .",
    "this can be improved at the cost of making the approximate density of states non - analytic , and using the distribution @xmath132 instead of  .",
    "together , the parameters @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 control the mean variance , skewness ( third central moment divided by the third power of the standard deviation ) and kurtosis of @xmath136 , which can be expressed in a closed form .",
    "linearizing the dependence of these moments on the above parameters leads to a more complex system of equations .",
    "one is thus forced to obtain the parameters values by multidimensional nonlinear fitting , losing the simplicity of the approximation  . on the other hand ,",
    "taking into account the skewness of the exact density of states allows to model better the excitation spectra with strongly non - homogeneous densities , such as @xmath9 ( square potential well ) .     for @xmath80 and 20 modes ( classical particles , quadratic mode spacings )",
    "the inset shows the range of @xmath15 values for which the edgeworth expansion fails to preserve the positivity of the sum of states . ]",
    "this example is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : skewed ] and compared with another skewness - sensitive approximation , the edgeworth expansion ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the latter uses chebyshev - hermite polynomials to approximate a non - gaussian probability distribution , and thus does not guarantee the positivity of probability density ( fig .",
    "[ fig : skewed ] , inset ) . in our comparison",
    "we have used the second - order edgeworth expansion , which uses the same set of distribution moments as our fourth - order approximation .",
    "it is given by the formula @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the @xmath139-th chebyshev - hermite polynomial , @xmath140 , @xmath141 is the @xmath142-th cumulant of the approximated distribution and @xmath143 .",
    "the proposed skewness - sensitive approximation is as close , or closer ( for low values of @xmath15 ) to the exact results as the edgeworth expansion , and does not generate negative values .",
    "in this section we discuss a number of physical problems in which our exact iterative formulas and analytic approximations can be applied .",
    "the iterative expression   can be used with arbitrarily discretized or real - valued mode excitations ( measured or obtained numerically ) , such as isolated quantum dots with known number of electrons , often used to realize qubits ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the `` modes '' of a single dot are individual electronic configurations , and the mode excitations are the total energies of electrons inside the dot . a number of such dots can be thus treated as a system of classical independent particles , and its thermodynamic properties described using the iterative formula  . since it treats every system configuration separately , this formula can also be used outside thermodynamics to calculate quantum properties which depend on the details of particular configurations , such as hamiltonian or thermal density matrix elements .    the next problem",
    "to which our fourth - order approximation can be applied is the entropy of a black hole and its relation to the area of the event horizon  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the appropriate ensemble in which to calculate the black hole entropy is the microcanonical one .",
    "this is true even for evaporating black holes , as they are not in the thermodynamic equilibrium  @xcite . within the loop quantum gravity theory , which quantizes geometry , entropy as the function of the event horizon area will be proportional to the logarithm of the number of different microstates of quantized area observables which sum up to a given total area .",
    "as these observables are distinguishable , we should use the classical particle statistics .",
    "the previous calculations of the microcanonical black hole entropy rely on the assumption that the excitation spectrum of the area operator is evenly spaced  @xcite , which is not true  @xcite .",
    "our results allow to extend the analytic approach to capture the full spectrum of the area operator excitations .",
    "similarly , they can be applied to the statistics of photons in an isolated microwave cavity containing a number of distinguishable atoms  @xcite .",
    "another problem for which our approximation is useful is the calculation of the nuclear state density  @xcite , i.e.  the density @xmath144 of nuclear microstates which realize a particular value @xmath15 of the @xmath17 component of the total angular momentum .",
    "bethe approximated @xmath144 with a gaussian distribution ( using the central limit theorem ) and assuming classical statistics for the particles constituting the nucleus  @xcite .",
    "this was a major drawback of his approach , as the constituent particles of a nucleus are really fermions , and thus the bethe approximation can be used only for small values of the total angular momentum of the nucleus  @xcite .",
    "an improvement of this approximation uses the edgeworth expansion ( see e.g.  @xcite ) matching the cumulants of @xmath144 calculated either in the canonical or grand canonical ensemble  @xcite . as we have stated in sec .",
    "[ sec : non - homogeneous ] , the edgeworth expansion does not guarantee the positivity of probability density .",
    "our method is free from this problem .",
    "although both methods capture higher moments of the density of states , the latter has the advantage that the resulting entropy @xmath145 is a polynomial function of the total excitation , and thus is easier to treat analytically .",
    "additionally , the calculation of matched moments is not relegated to other statistical ensembles , but is done consistently in the microcanonical one ",
    "see   and  .     and 50 modes .",
    "]    consequently , as fig .",
    "[ fig : fermcmp ] shows , our approximation achieves a better fit to the exact calculations as compared with the second - order edgeworth expansion ( which utilizes the same set of moments as our approximation , but is nevertheless more complicated ) .",
    "the presented results are for fermi statistics only , but the comparison for the other two gives similar results .    finally , we note that the free energy @xmath146 becomes within our approximation a polynomial function of the total excitation @xmath15 , which is particularly convenient when using the ginzburg - landau formalism ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . because it preserves the higher order @xmath147 term in the exponent , our method can be particularly useful when modeling systems containing small numbers of particles , in which the deviations from the gaussian limit become stronger .",
    "it has this advantage also over the edgeworth approximation , which ( although taking into account higher moments ) has only the @xmath148 term in the exponent of the density of states , and therefore does not lead to any free energy terms of higher than quadratic order .",
    "we have derived two exact expressions for the marginal or cumulative sum of states of classical , bosonic or fermionic particles , which are useful in practical calculations . exploiting a probabilistic analogy ,",
    "we have then obtained an analytic fourth - order approximation to the normalized sum of states ( density of states ) @xmath18 , which captures its variance and kurtosis .",
    "the approximation can be extended to an analytic - numerical scheme which also matches the skewness of @xmath18 and is better suited to handle excitation spectra with strongly non - homogeneous densities . as shown numerically , for all three particle statistics",
