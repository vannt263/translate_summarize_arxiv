    "in @xcite oshiro proved that colors @xmath4 and @xmath5 can always be removed from a non - trivial @xmath6-coloring .",
    "we mimic oshiro s approach to prove the following .",
    "[ thm : main ] let @xmath7 be a prime .",
    "let @xmath8 be a non - split link which admits non - trivial @xmath0-colorings .",
    "then colors @xmath2 , and @xmath3 are not needed in order to assemble a non - trivial @xmath0-coloring of @xmath8 .",
    "we now give an outline of the proof .",
    "we consider a diagram endowed with a non - trivial ( 2k+1)-coloring . for each color , @xmath9 , to be removed the strategy is the following .",
    "first we check if the color is used in the coloring .",
    "if it is not we are done .",
    "else we consider the following three possibilities , in turn .",
    "the first is to ascertain if the color @xmath9 is used in a monochromatic crossing .",
    "if it is not we go to the next step .",
    "else we remove the color @xmath9 from each monochromatic crossing in the diagram until there is no monochromatic crossing involving color @xmath9 .",
    "the next step is to check if @xmath9 is used in an over - arc .",
    "if it is not we go to the next step .",
    "else we remove @xmath9 from each over - arc until there is no over - arc with color @xmath9 .",
    "finally we check if @xmath9 is used in an under - arc . if it is not we are done .",
    "else we remove it from each under - arc until there is no under - arc using color @xmath9 .",
    "this ends the removal of color @xmath9 from the coloring .",
    "the actual removal of the color at each step is done by performing reidemeister moves on the diagram and consistently re - assigning colors in the neighborhoods affected by the transformations .",
    "the proof is split into three sections . in section [ sect:2k ]",
    "we show how to remove @xmath10 ; in section [ sect : remove2k-1 ] we show how to remove color @xmath11 , provided color @xmath10 is no longer being used ; and in section [ sect : removek ] we show how to remove color @xmath3 provided colors @xmath10 and @xmath11 are no longer being used .    in the sequel , in any figure",
    "the right - most diagram is the candidate to a diagram without the color under scrutiny , see figure [ fig : eps1 ] below , for example .",
    "for that the colors in the new arcs are analyzed .",
    "these colors are forced to equal the forbidden colors so that we identify the new situations we have to tackle . in the first cases we do the explicit calculations but later on we rely on displaying in tables the forbidden identities ( in the first row ) and their consequences ( in the second row ) .",
    "these consequences can be either an inconsistency ( which is marked by an @xmath12 ) and we can dismiss the situation , or an expression which helps us identify the new situation to be tackled .",
    "these new situations , in turn , are dealt with below in the text .",
    "we remark also that the inconsistencies are of the sort `` arc assuming a forbidden color '' or `` @xmath13 a prime less than @xmath14 or a composite integer '' , among others .    *",
    "expressions and equalities will be understood modulo @xmath15*.",
    "view figure [ fig : eps1 ] .",
    "we remark that the details of some crossings are irrelevant for the reasonings here . since we are trying to remove color @xmath10 we would not want @xmath16 in the diagram on the right - hand side to equal @xmath10 .",
    "let us look into the consequences of such identity . if @xmath17 then @xmath18 which amounts to @xmath19 .",
    "but if there is no pair of crossings in the diagram as depicted in figure [ fig : eps1 ] such that @xmath20 , then the whole coloring is monochromatic which conflicts with the standing assumption of a non - trivial coloring .",
    "( this corresponds to the inconsistencies we discussed above .",
    "below in the tables these instances will be marked with an @xmath12 . ) hence , by repeating this operation we can assume we remove all the monochromatic crossings with color @xmath10 .      view figure [ fig : eps2 ] .",
    "we have already seen that @xmath21 is equivalent to @xmath22 and we now note that @xmath21 is also equivalent to @xmath23 . in this way we have achieved the goal of removing color @xmath10 from over - arcs .",
    ".equalities which should not occur in figure [ fig : eps3 ] ( 1st row ) and their consequences ( 2nd row ) .",
    "these situations are dealt with in [ subsubsect:2kunderb2a+1 ] and [ subsubsect:2kunderba ] below . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]"
