    "@xcite has argued that d@xmath0 can be assigned to the breathing modes of a planar threefold ring , and d@xmath1 to that of a regular but slightly puckered fourfold ring within the continuous - random - network ( crn)@xcite . on the other hand and within the submicrocrystallite approach , phillips @xcite has proposed that within the a - sio@xmath0 structure there exist two types of non - bridging oxygen ( nbo ) sites at the surface of the cluster , which can be associated to the structure responsible for the d@xmath1 and d@xmath0 defect lines . to date , much work has been done in the light of both models . using a pair potential and the bond - polarizability ( bp ) model @xcite , murray and ching @xcite",

    "moreover , the ring statistic analysis showed that there are no three or fourfold rings in their models .",
    "this means that the d@xmath1 and d@xmath0 lines are not strictly due to the threefold rings and fourfold rings as suggested by galeener . to conciliate this later point of view and their work , murray and",

    "the time averaged power flux of raman scattered light in a given direction , with a frequency between @xmath4 and @xmath5 in a solid angle @xmath6 , is related to the differential scattering cross - section : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 with @xmath10 @xmath11 is the frequency of the incident light , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the polarization unit vectors for scattered and incident light respectively , @xmath14 is the bose factor , @xmath15 the mass of the @xmath16th atom , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are respectively the frequency and the @xmath19 component of the @xmath20th mode . the greek characters denote the cartesian components ( x , y , z ) .",

    "the calculated vv raman spectrum ( figure [ fig : vvhbp](a ) ) is dominated by a lower band , around 500 @xmath2 and reproduces the d@xmath1 = 495 @xmath2 and d@xmath0 = 606 @xmath2 peaks found in experimental spectra @xcite .",

    "we note also that the bands at 436 @xmath2 and 790 @xmath2 are close to the experimental bands observed around 430 @xmath2 and 800 @xmath2 @xcite . in our calculation within the bp approximation ,",
    "the double peak found experimentally in the high frequency region ( 1100 - 1200 @xmath2 ) are better reproduced than in previous works @xcite . concerning the vh spectrum , figure [ fig : vvhbp](b )",
    ", three major bands can be distinguished .",
    "the double peak in the high frequency region ( 1100 - 1200 @xmath2 ) are well placed and the curve is , generally , close to the experiment . the lower band ( @xmath59 500 @xmath2 ) and the intermediate one ( around 793 @xmath2 ) are positioned correctly but their intensities are too weak in comparison with the experimental lines .",
    "+ in the vv raman spectrum , the peaks around 430 @xmath2 , 800 @xmath2 and 1100 - 1200 @xmath2 have been understood in terms of the vibrations of a crn model @xcite .",
    "however the nature of the `` defects '' responsible for the d@xmath1 and d@xmath0 bands in the vv spectrum of a - sio@xmath0 is still the subject of a theoretical controversy @xcite . as we have recalled above , according to galeener @xcite , the d@xmath1 peak is due to the vibrational modes associated with oxygen atoms belonging to planar fourfold rings and the d@xmath0 peak to the ones associated with oxygens belonging to threefold rings within the crn model @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this , phillips @xcite argued that these bands may be associated with skeletal surface sio@xmath0 vibrational modes in the framework of paracrystalline theory . in the present work ,",
    "the structural characteristics of the studied systems showed , on one hand , that they contain threefold and fourfold rings and on an another hand that , as the models of murray and ching @xcite , none of them contain nbo sites or free surfaces . in figure",
    "[ fig : rings ] , we present the different ring size distributions of the three amorphous samples a , b and c. as it can be seen , the shapes of the ring size distributions are quite different for the three samples . since no particular trend can be derived with respect to the quench rates used to generate these model structures , the differences found in the distributions are attributed to the statistics .",
    "however it is interesting to note that there is a significant amount of three and fourfold rings in all three samples . in previous molecular - dynamics simulations",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that the concentration of small rings increases with an increasing quench rate . as a consequence ,",
    "the concentration of small rings in our samples is certainly much larger than in real sio@xmath0 samples .",
    "we find that the number of threefold rings varies from 1 in samples a and c , to 2 in sample b , and the number of fourfold rings are equal to 4 in sample a , to 3 in sample b and to 6 in sample c. nevertheless , as shown in figure [ fig : vvhbp ] , the vv raman spectra of our models present both d@xmath1 and d@xmath0 peaks which means that the later may be correlated with the presence of the three and fourfold rings as argued by galeener and excludes the phillips point of view .",
    "+      in order to clarify whether vibrational modes associated with the three and fourfold rings can be responsible for the d@xmath1 and d@xmath0 lines , we analyzed the raman intensity due to these specific geometries .",
    "however the connection between a given geometry in the amorphous structure and the raman intensity produced by it , is not straightforward at all .    in this perspective",
    ", we carried out an analysis on the three different samples individually .",
    "we first analyzed the modes that gave the strongest raman activity in the 470 - 515 @xmath2 range for the d@xmath1 line and in the 550 - 730 @xmath2 range for the d@xmath0 line .",
    "the selection of these modes was done first by ordering the modes as a function of their raman activity in the chosen frequency region .",
    "we then added together the activities of the most raman - active modes until the sum reaches 80 @xmath60 of the total sum : only the modes included in those 80@xmath60 were subsequently studied .",
    "then , for the selected modes , we computed the localization entropy defined as : @xmath61 where @xmath62 are the eigenmode components of mode @xmath20 and @xmath63 are the @xmath64 eigenmode components of atom @xmath16 .",
    "the above defined entropy is connected with the lack of information about the position of the @xmath20th phonon and gives the same kind of information than the participation ratio .",
    "if the mode is perfectly localized , then the lack of information is minimum and only one of the @xmath65 is equal to one , which leads to @xmath66 . on the other hand , if the @xmath20th mode is completely delocalized , then @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 is maximum , i.e. equal to 1 .",
    "here @xmath69 has been normalized to 1 for convenience , thus it is not a genuine entropy .",
    "let us consider the case where the @xmath20th mode is localized on a given ring composed of @xmath70 atoms .",
    "the value of @xmath69 would then be around : @xmath71 thus if a mode is localized on all atoms in a threefold or a fourfold ring , the corresponding @xmath72 would be close to 0.529 or 0.582 , respectively .",
    "table [ tab : entropy ] gives the localization entropies of the most raman - active modes for every sample in the chosen frequency ranges .",
    "note that @xmath69 gives an estimation of the localization of a mode but does not tell whether a mode is localized on a _ specific _ ring .    from table [ tab : entropy ] , it is clear that the most active raman modes in the 470 - 515 @xmath2 frequency range do not correspond to very localized modes since their localization entropies lie around 0.8 and are never smaller than 0.67 .",
    "the modes responsible of the d@xmath1 line can therefore not be considered as very localized modes . for d@xmath0 ,",
    "the situation is similar since the localization entropies lie also between 0.72 and 0.85 for the most intensive modes in the 550 - 730 @xmath2 frequency range .",
    "therefore this criterium does not appear to be useful in order to understand the nature of the modes responsible for the d@xmath1 and d@xmath0 lines .",
    "+ we then tried to find other criteria that could help to determine whether these modes can be associated to the three and fourfold rings or not .",
    "the first chosen criterium is based on vibrational considerations : for every mode and for each ring , we computed the following quantity @xmath73 if the atomic displacements due to the considered mode are of similar amplitude for every atom , then the value of @xmath74 would be equal to @xmath75 / 3@xmath76 for the fourfold rings and to @xmath77 / 3@xmath76 for the threefold rings since there are 8 or 6 atoms included , respectively .",
    "we therefore computed the quantity @xmath78 where @xmath70=8 for the fourfold rings and @xmath70=6 for the threefold rings , in order to obtain an estimation of the participation of atoms belonging to a given ring , for a given mode .",
    "if the @xmath20th mode is completely localized on a ring , one obtains the maximum value for @xmath79 : @xmath80 for the fourfold rings and @xmath81 for the threefold rings .",
    "let us recall however that for a completely delocalized mode , @xmath82 is equal to one and that @xmath83 means that the considered ring is not concerned by the @xmath20th mode .",
    "the second chosen criterium is based on the contribution of a given mode and a given ring to the total raman spectrum .",
    "this contribution is evaluated by computing what we name the `` raman ratio '' which is defined in order to estimate the contribution of each ring to the raman intensity of a given mode .",
    "let us consider a given ring .",
    "the raman intensity can be divided in three contributions by considering separately the atoms belonging to the ring and the other ones , in the following way : @xmath84    for a given polarization ( we omit the greek indices ) , the contribution to the raman scattering can be written as : @xmath85^\\star \\left[a'_{\\beta\\lambda}(j ) + a''_{\\beta\\lambda}(j ) \\right ] \\frac{1}{2 \\omega_j}(\\delta(\\omega-\\omega_j)-\\delta(\\omega+\\omega_j ) ) \\\\                    & = & \\sum_{j } \\left [ a'^\\star_{\\alpha\\gamma}(j)a'_{\\beta\\lambda}(j ) + a''^\\star_{\\alpha\\gamma}(j)a''_{\\beta\\lambda}(j ) + \\left\\ { a'^\\star_{\\alpha\\gamma}(j)a''_{\\beta\\lambda}(j ) + a''^\\star_{\\alpha\\gamma}(j ) a'_{\\beta\\lambda}(j )      \\right\\ } \\right ] \\\\                      & & \\times \\frac{1}{2 \\omega_j}(\\delta(\\omega-\\omega_j)-\\delta(\\omega+\\omega_j ) )   \\\\                    & = & h_{\\rm not \\",
    "ring}(\\omega ) + h_{\\rm ring}(\\omega ) + h_{\\rm overlap } ( \\omega)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to obtain the contribution of the atoms belonging to a given ring to a selected mode @xmath86 , we computed the integrated intensity of the spectrum , averaged over all possible sample orientations , in the chosen frequency range : @xmath87 with @xmath88 and @xmath89 where the @xmath90 denote the average over all possible orientations and @xmath91 has been obtained by setting to zero the @xmath92 atomic components of the considered ring for the selected mode @xmath86 .",
    "the integrals run over the frequency ranges corresponding to the d@xmath1 line or to the d@xmath0 line , depending on which type of rings we want to consider ( fourfold or threefold ) .    we then needed a quantity that could be used in order to compare the contributions of different rings to the same mode . for this , we defined the relative raman participation ratio as follows",
    ". the integrated raman intensity of the spectrum , averaged over all possible orientations , has been computed without the contribution of mode @xmath86 : @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 the relative raman participation ratio is then obtained by computing the quantity : @xmath96 the raman ratio gives the relative participation of the atoms belonging to a given ring to the raman intensity produced by the selected mode @xmath86 .",
    "if the atoms of the chosen ring do not participate to the mode @xmath86 then @xmath97 will be equal to zero and the raman ratio as well .",
    "on the other hand , if only the atoms of the ring participate to the raman scattering , then @xmath98 and the raman ratio is maximum , i.e. equal to @xmath99 ) . however , from the definition of @xmath97 ( eq . [ eq : vring ] ) , one can see that the raman ratio can be negative : this is due to the fact that the @xmath100 term can be negative with a magnitude larger than that of @xmath101 for the chosen ring .",
    "a negative @xmath97 would mean that there is a strong _ negative _ `` coupling '' between the atoms of the ring and the other atoms .",
    "a similar approach has already been used by lazzeri _",
    "et al . _ for the study of the ring contributions to the raman spectra of crystalline silica phases and zeolites and",
    "has produced negative overlaps in these phases @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a large and positive raman ratio would mean that the atoms of the ring participate to the mode but also that the coupling with the other atoms might be large and _ positive_. +      the results for the most raman - active modes in the 470 - 515 @xmath2 frequency range are presented in table [ tab : vibd1 ] for the a , b and c samples with the vibrational amplitudes ( @xmath102 ) on the left columns and the raman ratio on the right columns .",
    "if @xmath102 is larger than one for a given ring , the atoms belonging to this ring have larger displacements than the other atoms for the considered mode . from table [ tab : vibd1 ]",
    ", one can clearly see that the selected mode always gives rise to larger displacements on atoms belonging to one ( or more than one ) of the fourfold rings . as a consequence , one",
    "is tempted to `` associate '' raman - active modes to specific rings : for instance , the 474 @xmath2 mode in sample b generates large displacements on atoms belonging to ring 1 in that sample and the 507 @xmath2 mode in sample a generates large displacements on atoms belonging to rings 1 and 2 in that sample .    the fact that some modes can be associated to several rings lead us to check whether these rings had common atoms .",
    "the result of this analysis is presented in table [ tab : ring ] .",
    "most of the time , when modes give large displacements on several rings , the later have indeed common atoms , but this is not always true .",
    "for instance , the 500 @xmath2 mode in sample a generates large displacements on rings 2 and 3 , which do not have common atoms .",
    "this result indicates that there exist ring - like modes which concern more than one ring .",
    "the raman ratio defined above has been computed for the most raman - active modes in samples a , b and c and for every fourfold ring in these systems .",
    "results are presented on the right sides of table [ tab : vibd1 ] for samples a , b and c separately .",
    "we first notice that the raman ratio varies approximately from 1 to -1 and thus can be strongly negative .",
    "if we consider the largest positive raman ratio , we note that they almost always correspond to the largest values of @xmath102 . by cross checking the largest terms in both the vibrational amplitudes ( @xmath102 ) and the raman ratio",
    ", we can easily deduce that if the raman ratio is large and positive , the atoms of the ring undergo larger displacements than the other atoms and therefore that the contribution of these atoms to the mode is important . on the other hand ,",
    "if we consider the negative raman ratio , we note that they almost always correspond to small - or close to 1 - @xmath102 values .",
    "this result is an indication that if the raman ratio is negative , then the atoms of the ring do not participate much to the mode .    in order to illustrate the results presented in tables [ tab : vibd1 ] , we show examples of raman spectra from which the contributions of the atoms in individual rings have been extracted .",
    "let us consider the mode at 488 @xmath2 of sample c. in figure [ fig : vring_d1 ] , the total spectrum ( i@xmath103 ) and the spectrum where this mode has been removed ( i@xmath104 ) are depicted in bold lines .",
    "for this mode , the spectra for which the eigenmode components of atoms in rings 1 , 3 and 6 have been set to zero , are shown in dashed lines ( i@xmath105 ) . as it can be easily seen , for rings 1 and 6 , the i@xmath104 and i@xmath105 almost exactly coincide ( i@xmath104 - i@xmath105 is almost zero ) and the subtractions i@xmath103-i@xmath104 and i@xmath103-i@xmath105 are identical .",
    "this situation corresponds to a raman ratio close to one in table [ tab : vibd1 ] and indicates that the atoms of rings 1 and 6 contribute significantly to the 488 @xmath2 mode . on the opposite , for ring 3",
    ", the i@xmath105 gives rise to a larger d@xmath1 peak than that of the total vv spectrum , leading to a negative i@xmath103-i@xmath105 contribution and very different i@xmath104 and i@xmath105 spectra .",
    "this indicates that the atoms of ring 3 do not participate to the 488 @xmath2 mode .    as a summary",
    ", our results suggest that the modes which produce more than 80 @xmath60 of the raman activity in the frequency region of the d@xmath1 line can almost always be associated to the atoms belonging to one or more fourfold rings ( i.e. , the raman ratio is larger than 0.7 ) .",
    "furthermore more than 70 @xmath60 of the atomic displacements due to these modes ( @xmath102 ) are located on atoms belonging to the fourfold rings .",
    "one exception can be found for the 496 @xmath2 mode in sample c , for which the raman ratio is not larger than 0.5 for all rings .",
    "+      since the d@xmath0 line has been suggested to be due to modes involving the threefold rings , we analyzed the raman modes in the corresponding frequency region with respect to atoms belonging to such rings .",
    "in the three sio@xmath0 samples , the threefold rings are less numerous than the fourfold ones ( 1 in sample a , 2 in sample b and 1 in sample c ) , hence reducing the statistics in that case .",
    "the results for the most raman - active modes in the 550 - 730 @xmath2 frequency range ( corresponding to the d@xmath0 line in our spectrum ) are presented in table [ tab : vibd2 ] for samples a , b and c with the vibrational amplitudes ( @xmath106 ) on the left columns and the raman ratio on the right columns . as for the d@xmath1 line",
    ", we can observe that there is a correlation between the largest @xmath102 values and the largest positive raman ratio .",
    "we can also note that not all the raman - active modes in the d@xmath0 line region correspond to modes associated to the threefold rings , whereas the contrary is true : all rings participate to , at least , one raman - active mode in the d@xmath0 line region .",
    "as for the d@xmath1 line , we illustrate the results presented in table [ tab : vibd2 ] by the raman spectra depicted in figure [ fig : vring_d2 ] . in this figure , we chose to show the raman spectrum in which the mode of frequency 609 @xmath2 in sample b has been removed ( i@xmath104 ) together with the raman spectra in which the eigenmode components of atoms belonging to the threefold rings have been set to zero ( i@xmath105 for rings 1 and 2 ) .",
    "it is clear that if the eigenmode components of atoms in ring 2 are set to zero , the raman spectrum is identical to the one obtained if the selected mode is removed , i.e. the resulting difference i@xmath105 - i@xmath104 ( dotted line ) is zero . on the opposite ,",
    "the contribution of atoms of ring 1 to the 609 @xmath2 mode is non - existent .",
    "recently umari and pasquarello @xcite have deduced the proportion of oxygen atoms belonging to the threefold and fourfold rings in an experimental sample using a direct relation between the areas under the experimental and calculated d@xmath1 and d@xmath0 peaks , respectively . in view of the results presented in tables [ tab : vibd1 ] and [ tab : vibd2 ]",
    ", such an approach seems a bit hazardous .",
    "indeed , we have demonstrated that among the most raman - active modes in the regions of the d@xmath1 and d@xmath0 lines ( i.e. modes that produce more than 80 @xmath60 of the peaks ) , some can not be associated to modes involving atoms of a fourfold or a threefold ring .",
    "this result means that there is no proportionality relation between the area under the peaks and the proportion of threefold and fourfold rings in the sio@xmath0 glass .",
    "in order to mimic the effect of pressure , the box size of the amorphous sample c has been rescaled to three different sizes in successive steps .",
    "first , the box length and coordinates were rescaled from the experimental density of 2.20 g/@xmath55 to a density of 2.40 g/@xmath55 ( sample c1 ) and a car - parrinello molecular - dynamics simulations of 1.9 ps was launched at 300 k , using the cpmd code @xcite .",
    "the entire procedure was repeated for two other densities : 2.67 g/@xmath55 ( sample c2 ) and 4.28 g/@xmath55 ( sample c3 ) . for the sample at 2.67 g/@xmath55 ,",
    "the initial coordinates were taken and rescaled from the final ones of the simulation performed on sample c1 , and for the sample at 4.28 g/@xmath55 , the initial coordinates were taken and rescaled from the final ones of the simulation performed on sample c2 . in this latter case , an important modification of the structure leading to an large increase of the ionic temperature was observed .",
    "therefore during the first ps of the _ ab initio _ md simulation , the ionic temperature has been constrained to stay at 300 k. this constraint was then released for the rest of the _ ab initio _ md simulation on sample c3 . in order to achieve good convergence for the calculation of the pressures in samples c1 , c2 and c3 , higher energy cutoffs would be required .",
    "we estimated that this information was not worth the computational effort and obtained the pressures from the volume to pressure conversion using the experimental equation of state of a - sio@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the pressures of our samples are thus evaluated to @xmath107 3 gpa for sample c1 , @xmath107 7 gpa for sample c2 and @xmath107 34 gpa for sample c3 .    for samples",
    "c1 and c2 , we observe no modifications of the network topology .",
    "the observed structural modifications only concern the shift of the si - o - si angle distributions towards smaller angles ( figure [ fig : angles_comp ] ) and no changes in the si - o bond lengths and in the ring statistics are noticed .",
    "in contrast to this , the structure of sample c3 is very different from the ones of sample c , c1 and c2 : the tetrahedral network is destroyed and replaced by a mixing of four , five and sixfold - coordinated silicon atoms connected by corners and/or edges , and threefold - coordinated oxygen atoms .",
    "these coordination changes explain the very different si - o - si and o - si - o angular distributions observed in figure [ fig : angles_comp ] .    at the end of these _ ab initio _ molecular - dynamics simulations , the atomic coordinates were relaxed to 0 k and the dynamical matrices were computed as described in section [ sec : sio2 ] . for every sample , we then obtained the vibrational frequencies and the corresponding modes by a diagonalisation of the dynamical matrices .",
    "the vibrational densities of states of sample c and of the three compressed samples c1 , c2 and c3 are depicted in figure [ fig : dos_comp ] . as pressure",
    "is increased from c to c2 , the double peak in the high frequency region disappears and the peaks at @xmath108600 @xmath2 and @xmath108800 @xmath2 are shifted to higher wavenumbers .",
    "one can also notice a decrease of the peak intensity at @xmath108400 @xmath2 .",
    "on the other hand , the vibrational density of states of sample c3 exhibits very different features which reflect the changes in the structure : no clear gap can be seen in the broad peak going from @xmath108100 @xmath2 up to 1300 @xmath2 .      in figure [",
    "fig : raman_comp ] , the vv ( left panel ) and vh ( right panel ) raman spectra of the compressed samples c1 , c2 and c3 are compared to that of sample c. firstly , we note that the vv and vh spectra of sample c3 are very different compared to that of samples c , c1 and c2 , which is due to its very different density of states and structure . for the slightly compressed samples ( c1 and c2 ) the main band and the d@xmath1 line in the vv spectra merge into a sharp main peak .",
    "the intensity of this peak increases with increasing density and moves to higher wavenumbers .",
    "the increasing sharpness of the band around d@xmath1 with increasing density could be attributed to the shift to lower angle and the increasing sharpness of the si - o - si angle distribution shown in figure [ fig : angles_comp ] .",
    "in contrast with this behavior , the d@xmath0 line intensity does not increase with increasing density , however its position slightly shifts towards higher wavenumbers .",
    "one can also note that all the bands lower than 900 @xmath2 clearly shift to higher wavenumbers . on the opposite , in the high frequency region , we observe that the double peak slightly shifts to lower wavenumbers .",
    "overall these behaviors have been observed experimentally @xcite and reproduced by other numerical studies @xcite .",
    "for the vh spectra , we observe that the principal bands shift to higher wavenumbers except for the largest peak of the double peak in the high frequency region .",
    "+ in order to show the effect of compression on the ring contributions , we have evaluated the localization entropies , the vibrational amplitudes @xmath102 and the raman ratio as defined in section [ sec : rings ] for all rings in samples c1 and c2 .",
    "the sample c3 was not studied in that respect since the tetrahedral network is damaged in that sample .",
    "the results are presented in table [ tab : entropycomp ] for the entropies and in table [ tab : vibcompd1 ] and table [ tab : vibcompd2 ] for the @xmath102 values and the raman ratio in the frequency regions of the d@xmath1 and d@xmath0 lines , respectively .",
    "the results presented in table [ tab : entropycomp ] show that the modes contributing to the sharp line around 500 @xmath2 are less numerous in the compressed samples c1 and c2 than in sample c. for samples c1 and c2 , the frequency range in which these modes have been sought for was modified to take into account the frequency shift of the peaks .",
    "these frequency regions have been set to 490 - 540 @xmath2 for sample c1 and to 505 - 585 @xmath2 for sample c2 .",
    "it should be noted that the intense sharp peak at 540 @xmath2 in sample c2 is due to only two modes that produce 80 @xmath60 of the total raman intensity .",
    "however , the entropies of these modes are not much different from the ones of the modes responsible of the d@xmath1 line in the uncompressed samples .",
    "a similar conclusion on the localization entropy can be given for what concerns the most raman - active modes in the frequency region around the d@xmath0 line ( 605 - 770 @xmath2 ) .",
    "note however that there are more raman - active modes in this region than in the d@xmath0 region of the uncompressed sample c.    the vibrational amplitudes ( @xmath102 ) and the raman ratio ( see definitions in section [ sec : rings ] ) were then evaluated for the selected modes in the frequency regions of interest .",
    "the results for the modes in the 490 - 540 @xmath2 and 505 - 585 @xmath2 frequency regions are presented in table [ tab : vibcompd1 ] .",
    "the mode at 503 @xmath2 in sample c1 is clearly the same mode than the 488 @xmath2 one in sample c since the @xmath102 values and the raman ratio are maximum on rings 1 and 6 for this mode .",
    "the mode at 512 @xmath2 in sample c1 could also be related to the 496 @xmath2 mode in sample c if one considers the value of @xmath102 which is maximum on ring 5 . upon compression these two modes",
    "have been shifted of roughly 15 @xmath2",
    ". however , all the other modes that were associated to one or two rings in sample c , have disappeared in sample c1 and , upon further compression in sample c2 , even the modes that were still present in sample c1 vanished . for sample c2",
    ", the remaining modes in the 505 - 585 @xmath2 frequency range do not present large values of @xmath102 or of the raman ratio : this indicates that the raman - active modes in this frequency region can not be associated to motions of atoms belonging to a fourfold ring .",
    "since the same rings of sample c still exist in sample c2 , this result means that the compression induced a structural modification of the rings and of their environment that produced the extinction of the ring - like modes in the raman spectra . when sample c is compressed into c1 and c2 , the network connections ( and thus the rings )",
    "do not change with increasing density but only the angles and relative distances between atoms do .",
    "the changes in the raman spectra are therefore not due to a different proportion of rings but only to changes in the structure of the rings , mainly the decrease of the si - o - si angles .",
    "a more detailed analysis showed that the ring - like modes still exist in this frequency range ( i.e. there are modes for which @xmath102 is maximum for a given fourfold ring ) but their raman activities are much smaller , if not zero .",
    "the effect of compression seems to be a little different for the modes in the frequency region corresponding to the d@xmath0 line .",
    "the @xmath102 values and the raman ratio for the 605 - 770 @xmath2 frequency range are presented in table [ tab : vibcompd2 ] for the compressed samples c1 and c2 . in both samples ,",
    "one can see that there is always one mode being clearly associated to the threefold ring : the 646 @xmath2 mode in sample c1 and the 664 @xmath2 one in sample c2 .",
    "this result indicates that the mode at 619 @xmath2 in sample c is still present in samples c1 and c2 but is shifted of approximately 28 @xmath2 and 45 @xmath2 , respectively , upon compression .",
    "the ring - like mode associated to the threefold ring remains therefore raman - active upon larger compression than the ones associated to the fourfold rings .",
    "this is certainly due to the fact that the si - o - si angles in the threefold rings have less possibility to change than in the fourfold rings .",
    "indeed we checked that the si - o - si angles of the threefold ring in sample c , c1 and c2 change by less than 3@xmath109 upon compression , whereas changes of more than 20@xmath109 were noticed in the case of the si - o - si angles of the fourfold rings .",
    "we have presented results for vv and vh raman spectra for uncompressed and compressed amorphous silica models generated by _ ab initio _ molecular - dynamics simulations . to model scattering in these materials",
    "we have considered the bond - polarizability mechanism .",
    "this mechanism gives rise to vv and vh spectra in good agreement with experimental data in shapes and peak positions .",
    "analysis of the vv partial raman spectra confirms that the d@xmath1 and d@xmath0 peaks are due to the presence of four and threefold rings respectively , as suggested by galeener .",
    "the association of ring - like modes to the peaks was done by using two approaches , one based on the atomic motions of the atoms belonging to the ring and the other one based on the calculation of the partial raman spectra for atoms belonging to the ring .",
    "both approaches give qualitatively the same results and show that not all rings necessarily produce a strong raman activity .",
    "the raman spectra obtained for compressed samples were also computed and are in very good agreement with experimental results by hemley _",
    "@xcite for densified samples .",
    "as long as the tetrahedral network is maintained , we find that the raman peak around 500 @xmath2 is not necessarily due to modes associated to the fourfold rings although these rings are still present in the glass sample",
    ". however the d@xmath0 line still exists upon compression and can still be associated to the threefold rings .",
    "these results suggest that ( i ) there exist collective ring - like modes ( involving several rings ) , ( ii ) the presence of the d@xmath1 and d@xmath0 lines can be associated to the presence of fourfold and threefold rings in the glass sample , ( iii ) the absence of the d@xmath1 and d@xmath0 lines does not mean that there are no fourfold and threefold rings in the sample , ( iv ) the area under the d@xmath1 and the d@xmath0 peaks are not simply proportional to the concentration of small rings in the sio@xmath0 sample , as it has been previously proposed .    as a conclusion",
    ", we were able to show that a combination of classical models ( the molecular - dynamics simulations for the generation of the amorphous samples and the scattering models ) and of first - principles calculations ( the _ ab initio _ computation of the dynamical matrices ) can be used to successfully compute the raman spectra of amorphous silica and to extract detailed information about the raman signature of structural units such as small rings . + * acknowledgements * + we thank walter kob for very helpful discussions and a careful reading of the manuscript .",
