    "@xcite discovered a periodic oscillation in the times of maximum light of the rr lyrae variable rw dra .",
    "@xcite found that the light curve shape of rr lyrae itself changed with a secondary period of approximately 40 days .",
    "subsequently , long term secondary modulations in light curves have been identified for a number of well - observed rr lyrae variables .",
    "these secondary modulations are now usually referred to as the blazhko effect , although @xcite have suggested that the name blazhko - shapley effect might be appropriate in recognition of shapley s role in their discovery . in the milky way ,",
    "about 20 - 30% of rr lyrae variables of bailey type ab ( rrab , also termed rr0 ) show the blazhko effect @xcite . in the large magellanic cloud",
    "the percentage of rrab stars which show the blazhko effect is smaller , about 12% to 15% @xcite .",
    "periods of reported secondary modulations of classical blazhko effect rrab stars in the milky way range from 11  d to 533  d. more recently , secondary modulations similar or identical to the blazhko effect have also been discovered for a small percentage of the rr lyrae stars of bailey type c ( rrc or rr1 ) .",
    "reviews of the blazhko effect have been given by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . as we will discuss in @xmath07 ,",
    "several explanations have been advanced , but there is still no consensus on the mechanism underlying the blazhko phenomenon @xcite .",
    "many rr lyrae stars are known to have undergone changes in the length of their primary pulsation cycle @xcite . however , significant changes in the length of the blazhko period appear to have been reported for only four stars @xcite : xz dra , rv uma , rw dra , and the subject of this study , xz cyg ( hd 239124 , bd + 56 2257 ) .",
    "rr lyrae stars with changing blazhko periods are of particular interest because they may shed light on the cause of the blazhko effect .",
    "the variability of xz cygni was discovered in 1905 by l. ceraski .",
    "subsequent investigations have made xz cyg one of the best studied rrab stars .",
    "@xcite established that xz cygni displays the blazhko effect , finding the blazhko period to be approximately 57.4  d long .",
    "for the next half century , investigations of xz cyg confirmed the existence of a blazhko period near 57.4  d , though some indicated the possibility of a 41.6  d tertiary period as well @xcite . in the 1960s , however , xz cyg underwent striking changes .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite reported that the blazhko period of xz cyg abruptly lengthened to about 58.4  d in the mid 1960s .",
    "this change in the blazhko period was coincident with a sharp decrease in the primary pulsation period , which took place in several steps @xcite .",
    "more recently , the primary period has increased once more , rising to a value close to the one it had before its sudden decline @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the behavior of xz cyg between its discovery and 2002 .",
    "we will present new ccd photometry of xz cyg and analyze old and new observations of the star .",
    "our intent is to verify that the blazhko period of xz cyg has indeed changed and to understand how any changes in the blazhko period are related to changes in the primary period .",
    "finally , we will consider how observed changes in the blazhko period might constrain theoretical models of the blazhko phenomenon .",
    "differential @xmath1 band photometry of xz cyg was obtained with the 60-cm telescope of the michigan state university observatory between jd 2451338 and 2452506 ( 1999 june 8 through 2002 august 19 ) . until jd 2452202 observations were obtained with an apogee ap7 ccd camera .",
    "after that date , an apogee ap47p camera was used instead .",
    "the star tyc 3929 - 1703 - 1 was adopted as a primary comparison star and tyc 3929 - 1811 - 1 was used as a check star . transforming the tycho catalog @xmath2 and @xmath3 magnitudes to the johnson system using the prescription of @xcite , one obtains @xmath1 = 9.97 @xmath4 0.04 and @xmath5 = 1.31 @xmath4 0.08 for tyc 3929 - 1703 - 1 .",
    "differential v - band photometry for xz cyg is listed in table 1 .",
    "differential magnitudes are given in the sense @xmath1(xz cyg ) minus @xmath1(comparison star ) .",
    "the typical uncertainty in a measurment of @xmath6 is 0.01 mag .",
    "a total of 7738 observations of @xmath7v were obtained .",
    "the comparison star is redder than xz cyg itself , for which @xmath5 varies between 0.2 and 0.4 @xcite . because we are interested mainly in analyzing our observations to determine the length of the blazhko cycle , and because we do not have multi - filter observations , we have not attempted to apply any color corrections to observed values of @xmath6 . from the previously observed color range of xz cyg , we would expect such corrections to make the observed values of @xmath6 smaller by about 0.03 mag near maximum light and by 0.02 mag near minimum light for both the ap7 and ap47p observations .",
    "corrections of that size are not important for our purposes .",
    "441 additional measurements of @xmath7v were obtained between jd 2452210 and 2452601 ( 2001 october 27 to 2002 november 22 ) by g. samolyk , who used a 25 cm telescope of the milwaukee astronomical society observatory with a santa barbara instrument group st9e ccd .",
    "the uncertainty of a typical measurement of @xmath7v with this instrument is about @xmath40.02 mag .",
    "simultaneous observations of xz cyg indicate that the @xmath1 band photometric systems of the michigan state university observations and the milwaukee observations are the same to within @xmath40.01 mag . the milwaukee differential @xmath1 measurements are listed in table 2 .",
    "the same comparison star was used as for the michigan state university observations .",
    "the period search routines cleanest @xcite , period98 @xcite , and pdm @xcite were used to determine the primary period of xz cyg based upon the full ccd dataset .",
    "the three methods gave consistent results , @xmath8 = 0.466598 @xmath4 0.000002  d , a value also consistent with that recently determined by @xcite from aavso observations spanning the interval hjd 2448570 to 2452618 : 0.46659934 @xmath4 0.00000035  d. the light curve of xz cyg , folded according to the @xcite ephemeris , is shown in figure 1 ( for the michigan state university observations only ) and figure 2 ( for all of the ccd observations ) .",
    "these figures strongly indicate the existence of a continued blazhko effect in xz cyg during the time interval in which the ccd data were obtained .",
    "we then searched for possible additional periods in the ccd dataset using the cleanest and period98 programs .",
    "the data were prewhitened to remove the primary frequency , @xmath9 , and its nine higher harmonics ( 2@xmath9 , 3@xmath9, ... 10@xmath9 ) . prewhitening the data in that way left residuals with a standard deviation of 0.079 mag .",
    "the blazhko effect reveals itself in two different types of frequency structure .",
    "some blazhko variables show frequency triplets , with peaks at frequencies @xmath10 , where j = 1 , 2 , 3 , ... , k = 0 or 1 , and @xmath11 is the frequency of the blazhko period .",
    "other blazhko variables show only frequency doublets ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "our observations of xz cygni indicate the presence of frequency triplets , although the presence of frequency aliases complicates the fourier spectrum .",
    "a portion of the fourier spectrum around the frequency of the primary period is shown in figure 3 for the prewhitened data .",
    "the peaks at frequencies 2.12577 c / d and 2.16054 c / d would beat with the primary frequency at periods of 57.45  d and 57.59  d , respectively . similarly spaced peaks are evident in the fourier spectrum near frequency @xmath12 .",
    "overall , the peaks identified in the cleanest and period98 power spectra indicate the presence of a blazhko period of 57.5 @xmath4 0.2  d. subtraction of frequencies @xmath13 , where j = 1,2, .. 10 and @xmath11 = 0.01739 reduced the residuals to 0.042 mag , still significantly larger than the expected observational uncertainty .    with the data prewhitened to remove the primary and blazhko periods , a further search was conducted for peaks in the fourier spectrum which might represent a tertiary period .",
    "a portion of the resultant fourier spectrum is shown in figure 4 .",
    "the highest peaks occur at frequencies of 2.1191 c / d and 2.1698 c / d , which would beat with the primary frequency at intervals of 41.6  d and 37.5  d , respectively . a lesser peak is evident at a frequency of 2.1671 c / d , which would beat with the primary frequency at an interval of 41.8 c / d .",
    "note that the frequency at 2.1698 c / d can be interpreted as a one year alias of the frequency at 2.1671 c / d .",
    "the fourier spectrum around the location of @xmath12 shows peaks at frequencies of 4.2623 c / d and 4.3104 c / d , which would be indicative of a beat period of length 41.6  d. a peak is also evident at a frequency of 4.2596 c / d , which is , however , interpetable as a one year alias of the peak at 4.2623 c / d .",
    "we thus conclude that the ccd photometry indicates the existence of a tertiary period of length 41.6  d with an uncertainty of about @xmath4 0.2  d. as will be discussed later , this period is close to the tertiary periods found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "period98 was used to fit the data with a set of frequencies of the form @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the frequency of a 41.6  d tertiary period , 0.02404 c / d .",
    "the resultant fit left residuals of 0.029 mag , still somewhat larger than expected from observational error alone .",
    "a search for additional periodicities did not lead to clear evidence that any exist .",
    "a portion of the fourier spectrum around the primary frequency after removal of a 0.466598  d primary period , the 57.5  d secondary period , and 41.6  d tertiary period is shown in figure 5 .",
    "the frequencies , amplitudes , and phases of the components of this fit are listed in table 3 .",
    "the period search procedure was repeated incorporating just the michigan state university observations .",
    "the results , as might be expected , are very similar .",
    "the residuals in the final fit to the michigan state university observations were slightly smaller , @xmath4 0.026 mag .",
    "the effects of the secondary and tertiary periods have been removed from the lightcurve by subtracting the sidelobe components of the 57.5  d and 41.6  d periodicities .",
    "the resultant light curves , phased as in figures 1 and 2 , are shown in figures 6 and 7 .",
    "the most extensive studies of the behavior of xz cyg before the changes in primary period which began about 1965 are those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained the first detailed photoelectric observations of xz cyg , monitoring the star from 1948 until november 1952 .",
    "@xcite confirmed the existence of the secondary period reported by @xcite , finding the period to be approximately 57.4  d. however , @xcite found that the observations were better described if in addition to this secondary period there existed a tertiary period with a length of either 89.34 or 94.31 times the primary period , 41.7  d or 44.0  d , respectively , assuming a primary period of 0.4665839  d.    @xcite attempted , in so far as was possible , to put all existing observations of the maximum brightness of xz cyg on a consistent photometric system .",
    "@xcite then used the times and brightnesses of maxima obtained between jd 2417017 and jd 2434946 to study the long term behavior of xz cyg .",
    "@xcite found evidence for a small decline in the primary period of the variable during this time span , described by the ephemeris for the times of maximum light    @xmath17    where e is the number of cycles elapsed since the start date .",
    "thus , the period would have decreased from 0.4665878  d in 1905 to 0.466584  d in 1954 .",
    "@xcite provided a slightly different interpretation of the period changes of xz cyg during this interval , finding that the primary period decreased in a stepwise fashion from 0.4665861  d during jd 2417000 - 2424800 to 0.466579  d during the interval jd 2434600 - 2438700 ( ending in 1964 ) .",
    "whichever description one accepts for the period changes , it is clear that the primary pulsation period of xz cyg was relatively stable between 1905 and 1965 .",
    "@xcite confirmed the existence of a blazhko period of 123.040 times the primary period ( giving @xmath18 = 57.4  d ) .",
    "@xcite also confirmed the existence of a tertiary period of 89.23 times the primary period ( @xmath19 = 41.6  d ) .",
    "thus , three times the secondary period would be approximately ( but not exactly ) four times the tertiary period , as @xcite noticed .",
    "@xcite also identified a superposed , longer quaternary variation with a period of about 3460  d , during which there is a long term change in the mean magnitude at maximum light .",
    "this can be seen in figure 8 , which plots the magnitude at maximum light versus julian date for the maxima in table 10 of @xcite .",
    "not plotted in figure 8 are the later maxima listed by @xcite , which are approximately on the system of @xcite but which may not be exactly comparable .",
    "long term periodicities have been reported for a few other blazhko effect stars , most notably rr lyrae itself @xcite .",
    "in addition to its 41  d blazhko period , rr lyrae exhibits a four year periodicity .",
    "the amplitude of the blazhko effect varies during this longer cycle and the phase of the blazhko cycle shifts when one four - year cycle ends and the next begins .",
    "the data accumulated by @xcite indicate that the amplitude of the blazhko effect in xz cyg changed over time , but they are not sufficient to let us decide whether the 3460  d period is exactly analogous to rr lyrae s four year period .",
    "@xcite reported that j. balazs had identified a 153.8  d tertiary period for xz cyg , which , however , might also be interpreted as the beat interval between periods of approximately 57.4  d and 41.6  d.    as a check on the conclusions of @xcite and @xcite , the cleanest routine was used to search for periodicities in the magnitudes of maximum reported by @xcite .",
    "applied to the entire data range from jd 2417017 to jd 2434946 , the cleanest routine did identify periods of 57.41 ( @xmath40.02 )  d , 41.61(@xmath40.04 )  d , and 3540(@xmath4100 )  d. thus , we broadly confirm @xcite s results .",
    "nonetheless , it is also evident that these three periodicities are not able to explain much of the scatter in the data .",
    "the standard deviation of the maximum magnitudes about the mean was initially 0.113 mag . removing these three periods and their harmonics from the data reduced that value only slightly , to 0.086 mag .",
    "it is possible that instead of being 3540  d long , the actual longest period could be twice that value .",
    "when the data are phased with a circa 7000  d period , there are large gaps in the phase coverage which make it difficult to fully test that possibility . in figure 9",
    ", we plot the residuals of maximum magnitudes from @xcite after removal of the three identified periodicities .",
    "moreover , when subsamples of the data are examined , it is clear that the strength of the secondary period has not been constant over the entire duration of the observations collected by @xcite .",
    "there is , for example , little evidence for a circa 57  d period in the observations made from jd 2417017 to 2417538 . a period near 57.34  d is , however , present in the observations made between jd 2424370 and jd 2427750 ( figure 10 ) .",
    "such variability in the blazhko effect would , of course , not be unique to xz cyg , being also well observed in rr lyrae itself , for example .",
    "in addition , despite the efforts by @xcite to place all observations on a consistent system , the heterogeneity of the observations makes it difficult to compare results over the entire time interval for which @xcite tabulated maxima .    for the interval spanned by the observations of @xcite and the data compiled by @xcite",
    ", one can conclude that the primary period of xz cyg was decreasing slightly but was relatively stable , and that additional periods of length about 41.6  d , 57.4  d , and 3540  d were present .",
    "the durability of the 3540  d period is uncertain , since it could be followed for only a few cycles , and , as we have noted , the possibility that the longest period is 7000  d rather than 3540  d can not be entirely excluded .",
    "moreover , it appears likely that the amplitudes of the 41.6  d and 57.4  d periodicities were not constant throughout that time interval .",
    "nonetheless , our check confirms prior studies of the behavior of xz cyg before 1965 .",
    "beginning about jd 2438800 ( 1965 ) , the primary period of xz cyg began a steep decline in several steps @xcite .",
    "the primary period fell to a minimum of 0.4664464  d during the interval jd 2442050 to jd 2443740 , 1974 to 1978 @xcite . in 1979 , the primary period sharply increased , rising to values slightly greater than those observed before the steep decline .",
    "changes in the primary period of xz cyg since 1965 are listed in table 4 , which follows @xcite .",
    "the periods reported in @xcite are similar to those reported by @xcite for time intervals covered in both studies .    shortly after the decline in the primary period of xz cyg , observers began to report a coincident increase in its 57.4  d blazhko period @xcite . these indicated that , at about the time that the primary period of xz cyg fell to its minimum , the blazhko period of xz cyg increased to about 58.4  d , or perhaps slightly more . an o - c diagram illustrating",
    "this change in the blazhko period is included in @xcite . as a check and an extension of these earlier results ,",
    "we have analyzed observations of xz cyg reported since 1965 to the rr lyrae committee of the american association of variable star observers ( aavso ) .",
    "aavso observers have accumulated a large number of visual observations of xz cyg since 1965 .",
    "these data mainly consist of observations obtained near the time of maximum light , rather than equally covering the entire light cycle .",
    "we begin by considering m. baldwin s observations of the magnitude attained by xz cyg at maximum light @xcite . in figure 11",
    ", we plot the magnitude of maximum light against julian date .",
    "it is apparent that the range of scatter in the maxima was relatively large around jd 2443000 , but diminished after 2444000 .",
    "this change is also evident in the plots of o - c ( observed minus calculated times of maximum light ) in @xcite , which are corrected for the observed changes in the primary period of the star .",
    "the diminution in the scatter was noticed by @xcite who further noted that it was approximately coincident with the abrupt large increase in the primary period of xz cyg which took place near jd 2444000 .",
    "subsequent to jd 2449000 , there is some evidence for an increase again in the size of the scatter of the maximum magnitudes , but not to the level observed near jd 2443000 .",
    "we have made two new analyses of the aavso observations to determine the length and amplitude of the blazhko cycle during the time interval covered by the aavso observations .",
    "we first searched for a periodicity in the magnitude reached at maximum light using the cleanest routine , limiting ourselves to the maxima observed by m. baldwin to reduce the possibility of systematic errors among different visual observers .",
    "results from this analysis are listed in table 5 .",
    "we also searched for periodicities in the o - c values provided by @xcite . in this case , we analyzed all of the o - c values reported by aavso observers .",
    "results from a period search using the cleanest program are listed in table 6 . for comparison ,",
    "in table 7 we list a number of determinations of the blazhko period of xz cyg from the literature .",
    "these analyses confirm that in the interval from about jd 2439000 to 2444000 the blazhko period was indeed about a day longer than it had been in the time intervals studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the blazhko amplitude was particularly large around jd 2443000 , when the primary period of xz cyg was near its minimum .",
    "the blazhko periodicity was apparently suppressed for awhile when the primary period abruptly increased near jd 2444050 , before gradually starting to reassert itself .",
    "the renewed blazhko period is shorter again .",
    "however , the evidence for the current length of the blazhko period is stronger in the ccd observations than in the aavso visual data",
    ".    it would be very interesting to know whether the 41.6  d tertiary period was still present at the time that the secondary period was near 58.5  d. to investigate this we analyzed aavso data obtained between jd 2438882 and jd 2443800 .",
    "figure 12 shows the fourier spectrum for the 109 maximum magnitudes observed by baldwin during this time interval .",
    "a strong peak is evident at a frequency of 0.01709 c / d , corresponding to a period of 58.5  d. figure 13 plots the maximum magnitudes , phased with the 58.5  d period . for comparison ,",
    "the same maxima phased with a 57.4  d period are plotted in figure 14 .",
    "figure 15 shows the fourier spectrum of the data after the magnitudes at maximum have been prewhitened to remove the 58.5  d periodicity and its four highest harmonics .",
    "no clear peak is evident near a frequency of 0.024 c / d , corresponding to a periodicity of 41.6  d. the two highest peaks occur at frequencies of 0.019377 c / d and 0.016345 c / d , corresponding to periods of 51.6  d and 61.2  d , respectively .",
    "these periods would beat against a 58.5  d period in about 440 days and 1300 days , respectively .",
    "they are , however , much weaker than the 58.5  d blazhko period , and it is doubtful whether they correspond to physically real periodicities .",
    "a similar analysis was performed on 182 o - c values observed during the same interval , excluding two values which were very deviant from the trend of the other observations .",
    "the fourier spectrum for these observations ( figure 16 ) shows a peak at 0.01706 c / d , corresponding to a period of 58.6  d , which is consistent within the uncertainties with the value seen in figure 12 .",
    "the o - c values are phased with a 58.5  d period in figure 17 , which shows considerably more scatter than in the corresponding diagram for magnitude at maximum light . for comparison ,",
    "figure 18 shows the o - c values phased with a 57.4  d period . prewhitening to remove the 0.01706 c / d frequency",
    "again left no clearly significant peaks in the fourier spectrum .",
    "thus , while we find a blazhko period of approximately 58.5  d to be present in both the times and brightnesses of maximum light during this interval , we find no evidence for a tertiary period .",
    "any tertiary periodicity present at this time must have had an amplitude less than about a third that of the 58.5  d blazhko cycle .",
    "in contrast , figure 19 shows the fourier spectrum for o - c observations obtained between jd 2448570 and jd 2452618 .",
    "the peaks at frequencies of 0.01736 c / d and 0.02404 c / d indicate the existence of 57.6  d and 41.6  d periods .",
    "a peak is also evident at frequency 0.0146 c / d , corresponding to a period of 68.5  d. that , however , is the one year alias of the 57.6  d period .",
    "figure 20 plots the blazhko period versus the fundamental mode period for xz cyg .",
    "here we have used our results for the length of the blazhko period and have adopted the results of @xcite for the length of the primary period . for the earlier maxima listed by @xcite , we have adopted an average primary period of 0.466584  d. note that , while the blazhko period clearly is correlated with the fundamental mode period , the exact form of that correlation is not clear .",
    "there might be a linear correlation , with @xmath20 = -8 @xmath21 .",
    "on the other hand , the blazhko period might have jumped discretely from a value near 57.4  d when @xmath8 was near 0.4666  d to a value near 58.5  d when @xmath8 was smaller than 0.46655  d.",
    "as noted in  1 , changes in the blazhko period have been reported for three rr lyrae stars besides xz cyg @xcite . in all four reported cases of changing blazhko periods",
    ", the change in the blazhko period is coincident to changes in the primary pulsation period .",
    "however , the ratios of the changes in the blazhko period to those of the primary period , as well as the sign of that ratio , differ from star to star . in the case of xz dra @xcite , the primary period and the blazhko period change with the same sign . in the other three cases ,",
    "rv uma @xcite , rw dra @xcite , and xz cyg , the reported changes of the blazhko period have a sign opposite that of the changes in the primary period . of the four stars ,",
    "xz cygni has undergone the largest changes in its primary period .",
    "observed ratios of @xmath22 are listed in table 8 . for the purposes of this table ,",
    "we have assumed a linear dependency of the change in the blazhko period upon the change of the primary ( fundamental mode ) period .",
    "such a linear dependency is consistent with the observations , but , as we have noted above , other dependencies are also possible . in the case of rw dra , the changes in period have been estimated from the o - c diagram of @xcite . as is the case for xz cyg , very long additional periods",
    "have been reported for two of the remaining three stars .",
    "@xcite identified a 7200  d tertiary period in xz dra , while @xcite reported that rv uma also shows a long term cycle of 2,000 to 3,000 days .",
    "as also noted in  1 , there is of yet no completely satisfactory explanation for the blazhko phenomenon .",
    "proposed explanations can be broadly divided into two groups : ( 1 ) magnetic models , in which blazhko variables have a magnetic field with an axis tilted obliquely with respect to their axis of rotation , and ( 2 ) resonance models , in which there is a nonlinear resonance between the dominant radial mode and a nonradial pulsation mode .",
    "oblique magnetic rotator models @xcite generally require that the blazhko period and the rotation period of the star are equal . @xcite and @xcite reported the presence of a magnetic field in the photosphere of the brightest blazhko variable , rr lyrae itself .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite have not detected any strong magnetic field in rr lyrae .",
    "the recent results by @xcite have not yet been published in full detail , but if the preliminary results are confirmed they would provide perhaps the strongest argument against any oblique magnetic rotator model .",
    "oblique rotator models have also predicted the existence of a quintuplet rather than a triplet structure in frequency @xcite .",
    "we do not see such a structure in xz cygni , nor has it been identified in largescale surveys of blazhko variables @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have modeled the excitation of nonradial pulsation modes in rr lyrae stars .",
    "they suggested that excitation of an _",
    "_ = @xmath41 pair might result in enough amplitude and phase modulation in the light curve to produce the blazhko effect . in their models ,",
    "rotational splitting of the _ m _",
    "= @xmath41 modes produces the sidelobes of frequency triplets in the fourier spectra of photometric observations . the blazhko period in this model",
    "is fixed by the rotation rate of the star , weighted with the brunt - visl frequency @xcite in the deepest part of the radiative envelope .",
    "thus , there would still exist in this model a dependency of the blazhko period upon the rotation period of the star .",
    "it is difficult to test models of nonradial mode resonance on the basis of photometric data alone , although @xcite and @xcite have shown that a combination of photometry and high resolution spectroscopic data can constrain possible nonradial modes .",
    "however , the observed changes in the blazhko period of xz cyg and other rr lyrae variables allow additional constraints to be imposed upon theoretical explanations for the blazhko phenomenon .",
    "changes in the blazhko period have been observed for at least four rr lyrae variables , as noted above . in the case of xz cyg ,",
    "the length of the blazhko period increased by about 2% before returning to something close to its original value .",
    "an increase and later decrease in the rotation period of xz cyg by as much as 2% is physically implausible .",
    "moreover , while a large increase in the radius of xz cyg around 1965 might produce a longer rotation period , the pulsation equation , @xmath23 , would then indicate that the primary period should have increased , not decreased , at that time .",
    "we would therefore argue that the blazhko period of xz cyg is unlikely to be equal to or directly proportional with its period of rotation .",
    "that is another argument against simple oblique magnetic rotator models .",
    "it may also be an argument against the nonradial excitation models of @xcite and @xcite , although there the argument is not so clear . if the rotationally split _",
    "= @xmath41 modes could manage to maintain a relatively constant frequency at the time that the frequency of the fundamental radial mode changed , then it is possible for the beat period of the radial and nonradial modes to change so as to produce the observed changes in the blazhko period .    in the case of xz cyg , there are additional observations that any complete theory must explain .",
    "first is the existence of a 41.6  d tertiary period .",
    "this period exists at the same time as the main 57.5  d blazhko period .",
    "it might be explained through the excitation of an additional nonradial mode .",
    "that mode may not have been excited during the interval when the blazhko period of xz cyg was near 58.5  d. second , we have the coincidence in the changes of the blazhko period and of the period of the fundamental radial mode .",
    "third , the blazhko effect in xz cyg continued strongly after the decline in the fundamental mode period of the star , but seems to have diminished when the fundamental period increased again .",
    "one might imagine that the blazhko effect was somehow turned off when the primary period increased , taking some years to become re - established .",
    "the possibility that this simultaneous change in the blazhko amplitude and the primary period was coincidental seems unlikely , but can not be entirely excluded .",
    "the blazhko effect in xz cyg and other rr lyrae stars has undergone changes in amplitude even when the primary period of the star has been relatively stable .",
    "how the multiyear periods seen in xz cyg and other rr lyrae stars are related to the blazhko phenomenon also remains unclear .",
    "it is interesting that xz cyg seems to have returned to something close to the state it had during the first half of the twentieth century following several decades of large period changes .",
    "it has long been known that evolution can not account for all of the observed changes in the primary periods of rr lyrae variable stars ( see the review in @xcite ) . some sort of period change noise appears to overlie any evolutionary period changes in these stars .",
    "it has been suggested that this noise might be related to discrete mixing events associated with the semiconvective zone of the stellar core @xcite . whatever is responsible for the period change noise , in the case of xz cyg that mechanism was capable of reversing its behavior in a way that seems to have returned the structure of the star to something close to the state it had half a century before .",
    "we confirm that the blazhko period of xz cyg increased sharply from about 57.4  d to 58.5  d at the same time that its primary pulsation period underwent a sharp decline .",
    "subsequently , when the primary pulsation period increased once more , the blazhko period decreased . during the intervals when xz cyg has had a blazhko period near 57.4  d , it has also shown a tertiary period with a length of 41.6  d. when the blazhko period was near 58.5  d , the 41.6  d tertiary period either was not present or had an amplitude much smaller than that of the 58.5  d periodicity .",
    "the amplitude as well as the period of the blazhko effect in xz cyg has changed over time .",
    "we particularly note the disappearance or diminution of the blazhko effect around jd 2444000 , at about the same time that the primary period jumped from 0.4664464  d to 0.4666938  d. the blazhko effect is evident again after about jd 2448570 , at which time the primary period had decreased to 0.466599  d. during the first half of the twentieth century , photometry of xz cyg also showed evidence for a fourth period , in this case almost 10 years in length .",
    "the observed changes in the blazhko period of xz cyg and a few other blazhko stars argue that the blazhko period is not exactly equal to or directly proportional to the rotation period of the star , as required by some theoretical models .",
