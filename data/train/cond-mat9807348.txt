    "<S> we report the results of magnetic measurements on a powder sample of nicu(pba)(d@xmath0o)@xmath1@xmath22d@xmath0o ( pba=1,3-propylenebis(oxamato ) ) which is one of the prototypical examples of an @xmath3=1/2 and 1 ferrimagnetic chain . </S>",
    "<S> susceptibility(@xmath4 ) shows a monotonous increase with decreasing temperature ( t ) and reaches a maximum at about 7 k. in the plot of @xmath4@xmath5 versus @xmath6 , the experimental data exhibit a broad minimum and are fit to the @xmath4@xmath5 curve calculated for the ferrimagnetic heisenberg chain composed of @xmath3=1/2 and 1 . from this fit , we have evaluated the nearest - neighbor exchange constant @xmath7=121 k , the g - values of ni@xmath8 and cu@xmath8 , @xmath9=2.22 and @xmath10=2.09 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> applied external field dependence of @xmath4@xmath5 at low temperatures is reproduced fairly well by the calculation for the same ferrimagnetic model .    </S>",
    "<S> extensive studies of one - dimensional systems were prompted by haldane s theoretical work  @xcite in 1983 after the initial wave of studies  @xcite in the late 1960s and early 1970s . </S>",
    "<S> recently , quantum spin systems with singlet ground states , namely haldane systems  @xcite ( linear chain heisenberg antiferromagnets with integer spin values ) , inorganic spin - peierls systems  @xcite and even - leg spin ladder systems ,  @xcite have been studied extensively . in particular , cuprate systems have attracted much attention because of the relation to high @xmath11 superconductors .    in regard to the one - dimensional systems with magnetic ground states , an @xmath3=1/2 and 1 ferrimagnetic chain has been theoretically investigated recently ,  @xcite in addition to some pioneering theoretical works  @xcite published in the 1980s . from the low dimensionality and small spin values in this system , we expect a kind of quantum effect . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical studies show some remarkable features as follows : ( 1 ) between two low - lying , gapless and gapped excitation branches , the gapped branch lies higher than that deduced from a conventional spin wave theory . from reliable calculations ,  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> the gap ( @xmath12/@xmath13 ) has been evaluated to be 1.767@xmath140.003 where @xmath13 is the nearest - neighbor exchange constant . </S>",
    "<S> the definition of the hamiltonian will be shown later . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) the spin correlation length between sublattice moments is extremely short . </S>",
    "<S> the length is below unit cell length and can not be evaluated with numerical accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) the full magnetization curve up to saturated magnetization is calculated and is obviously different from that for a classical ferrimagnet .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    on the other hand , although some candidates for the ferrimagnetic heisenberg chain composed of spin 1/2 and 1 exist in real bimetallic substances ,  @xcite only preliminary magnetic measurements and comparisons with numerical calculations were made .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite thus , we investigate precisely the magnetic properties of an alternating ni and cu chain compound nicu(pba)(d@xmath0o)@xmath1@xmath22d@xmath0o ( pba=1,3-propylenebis(oxamato ) ) . in these measurements , we use a deutrated sample because it is of superior quality to a hydrated one , although reason for this remain unclear and we plan to perform neutron scattering measurements on this deutrated sample . </S>",
    "<S> the format used in this letter is as follows : in the next section , we discuss the synthesis and crystal structure of nicu(pba)(d@xmath0o)@xmath1@xmath22d@xmath0o . </S>",
    "<S> we then report the results of magnetic measurements and of the comparison with numerical calculations for @xmath3=1/2 and 1 ferrimagnetic heisenberg chain . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show the field dependence of @xmath4 times @xmath6 and compare the experimental data with calculated ones for the same model .    </S>",
    "<S> powder samples of nicu(pba)(d@xmath0o)@xmath1@xmath22d@xmath0o were synthesized according to the procedure reported in ref .  13 . </S>",
    "<S> na@xmath0[cu(pba)]@xmath26h@xmath0o was prepared from cuso@xmath15 , naoh and 1,3-trimethylenebis(oxamido )  @xcite which was previously synthesized from ethyl oxamate and 1,3-propanediamine . </S>",
    "<S> then , the title compound was obtained by slow diffusion of aqueous solutions ( d@xmath0o @xmath1699.8% ) of na@xmath0[cu(pba)]@xmath26h@xmath0o and ni(clo@xmath15)@xmath0@xmath26h@xmath0o in a u - tube . </S>",
    "<S> chemical analysis showed a slight deviation of h content from the ratio in the ideal deutrated sample , but the molecular weight of this sample was only about 1% smaller than that of nicu(pba)(d@xmath0o)@xmath1@xmath22d@xmath0o . </S>",
    "<S> crystal structure of nicu(pba)(h@xmath0o)@xmath1@xmath22h@xmath0o has not been analyzed , but that of a similar compound mncu(pba)(h@xmath0o)@xmath1@xmath22h@xmath0o where mn replaces ni , has been analyzed .  @xcite powder x - ray diffraction patterns of these compounds show that these belong to the same space group . </S>",
    "<S> thus , nicu(pba)(h@xmath0o)@xmath1@xmath22h@xmath0o crystallizes in the orthorhombic system and belongs to the @xmath17 space group .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite as shown in fig .  1 , the structure consists of ordered bimetallic chains along the @xmath18 axis with octahedral ni@xmath8 and square - pyramidal cu@xmath8 ions bridged by oxamato groups . at the apical positions of ni and cu , water molecules are bound .    </S>",
    "<S> magnetic measurements were carried out with a squid magnetometer ( quantum design s mpms - xl7l ) at kyokugen in osaka university . </S>",
    "<S> we show in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 the dc magnetic susceptibility @xmath4(=@xmath19/@xmath20 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent magnetization of the sample and the external magnetic field , respectively ) of a powder sample of nicu(pba)(d@xmath0o)@xmath1@xmath22d@xmath0o . </S>",
    "<S> the susceptibility of nicu(pba)(d@xmath0o)@xmath1@xmath22d@xmath0o increases monotonously with decreasing temperature until about 7 k , at which the susceptibility reaches a maximum . below 7 k </S>",
    "<S> , the long - range order probably occurs due to the interchain couplings .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 shows @xmath4 times @xmath6 of nicu(pba)(d@xmath0o)@xmath1@xmath22d@xmath0o as a function of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this plot is familiar to chemists but not to physicists . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we explain this plot in some details . if a magnetic system is paramagnetic , @xmath4@xmath5 is constant over the whole temperature range . if a magnetic system has a dominant ferromagnetic ( antiferromagnetic ) interaction , @xmath4@xmath5 increases ( decreases ) when the temperature is decreased . in fig .  3 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath4@xmath5 decreases when decreasing the temperature from 300 k , implying that antiferromagnetic coupling exists between the nearest neighbor spins , and reaches a rounded minimum at about 70 k. then , @xmath4@xmath5 increases and reaches a maximum at about 10 k , and hereafter , when the temperature is decreased further , it decreases rapidly . </S>",
    "<S> the increase in @xmath4@xmath5 below 70 k implies that this ferrimagnetic system behaves like a ferromagnetic chain at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> interchain ( antiferromagnetic ) couplings probably give rise to the steep decrease of @xmath4@xmath5 below 10 k. we compare the experimental data with numerical calculations ( exact diagonalization method up to five unit cells ( ten sites ) ) for the @xmath3=1/2 and 1 ferrimagnetic heisenberg chain . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of this system in a magnetic field is defined by @xmath21}\\\\         -g_{s } \\mu_{\\rm b}h \\sum_{i=1}^{l } { { \\bf s_{i}}}-g_{s } \\mu_{\\rm          b}h \\sum_{i=1}^{l } { { \\bf s_{i}}},\\ ] ] where * s * and * s * are the @xmath3=1 and @xmath3=1/2 spin operators , respectively , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 the g - values of the @xmath3=1 and @xmath3=1/2 magnetic moments , respectively , and @xmath24 the bohr magneton and @xmath25 the external magnetic field . here , the periodic boundary condition is imposed , so that * s*@xmath26=*s*@xmath27 . the solid line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 shows the result of the best fit to the experimental data between 30 k and 150 k. good agreement between experimental and calculated results is achieved between 30 k and 150 k. slight deviation at high temperatures may arise from the error enhancement of @xmath4@xmath5 at high temperatures or the omission of the single ion anisotropy term which exists in ni(@xmath3=1 ) compounds . from this fit </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the exchange constant @xmath7=121 k , @xmath22(=@xmath9)=2.22 and @xmath23(=@xmath10)=2.09 .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we show the magnetic field dependence of @xmath4@xmath5 in fig .  4 . </S>",
    "<S> experimental data of @xmath4@xmath5 at 0.1 t ( open squares ) , 1 t ( open triangles ) and 7 t ( open circles ) are plotted in the upper panel . </S>",
    "<S> experimental data at 0.1 t and 1 t have a similar tendency , but @xmath4@xmath5 at 7 t at low temperatures deviates significantly from the others . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is reproduced in the calculation shown in the lower panel . here </S>",
    "<S> , the designated @xmath20/@xmath13 figures represent those of @xmath28/@xmath13 with @xmath29=2.0 and @xmath7=121 k , and magnitudes of @xmath4@xmath5 are calculated for the above hamiltonian using @xmath22=2.22 and @xmath23=2.09 . </S>",
    "<S> the low temperature behavior of @xmath4@xmath5 at 7 t implies that the n@xmath30el order tends to be fixed and the ferromagnetic fluctuation of magnetic moments is suppressed by the external field </S>",
    "<S> .    in conclusion , magnetic properties of alternating ni and cu chain compound nicu(pba)(d@xmath0o)@xmath1@xmath22d@xmath0o were investigated by magnetic susceptibility measurements . from comparison with a numerical calculation for the ferrimagnetic heisenberg chain composed of @xmath3=1/2 and 1 </S>",
    "<S> , we have obtained the values of the exchange constant and the @xmath29-values of ni and cu . </S>",
    "<S> field dependence of @xmath4@xmath5 at low temperatures has been reproduced by similar calculations in magnetic fields . </S>"
