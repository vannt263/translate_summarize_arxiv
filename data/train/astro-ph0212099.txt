    "ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) are characterized by their huge luminosity output in the infrared , which is predominantly powered by super - starbursts and/or hidden agn ( e.g. , genzel et al .",
    "1998 , sanders 1999 ) .",
    "many distant _ scuba _ sources , massive and dusty galaxies , are believed to be ulirg equivalents at high redshift ( e.g. , barger et al .",
    "1998 , lawrence 2001 ) .",
    "local ulirgs , of which ngc 6240 is regarded a key representative , are therefore important laboratories to study the physics of superwinds driven by the nuclear starbursts , the processes of igm enrichment , to search for the presence of hidden agn , and to study the physics of galaxy formation ( many ulirgs are interacting galaxies , believed to be on the verge of forming elliptical galaxies ) .",
    "ngc6240 is one of the nearest members of the class of ulirgs , and has been intensely studied at virtually all wavelengths .",
    "the galaxy shows conspicuous loops and tails , and two optical nuclei separated by @xmath11.8@xmath2 ( fried & schulz 1983 ) which are also detected in the ir and radio band .",
    "recent observations suggest that ngc6240 is in a relatively early merger state ( tacconi et al .",
    "1999 , tecza et al .",
    "2000 , gerssen et al .",
    "it is expected to finally form an elliptical galaxy .",
    "ground - based optical spectroscopy of ngc6240 shows liner - like emission - line ratios .",
    "given the importance of the question whether an agn is present , and whether it is the ultimate power - source of the ulirg ngc6240 , efforts to search for such an agn were undertaken at all wavelengths ( see sect . 1 of komossa et al .",
    "1998 for a review ) .",
    "recent observations include the detection of flaring water - vapor maser emission from ngc6240 ( nakai , sato & yamauchi , 2002 ) , the presence of a high - excitation [ oiv ] infrared emission line ( genzel et al . 1998 ) , and the compactness of the radio cores ( beswick et al . 2001 ) . in x - rays ,",
    "ngc6240 exhibits exceptionally luminous extended emission ( schulz et al .",

    "it is the hard x - ray observations that give the best evidence for the presence of an agn in ngc6240 .",
    "it remained basically an open question , which of the two nuclei of ngc6240 is the active one ( or whether even both of them are ) ; _ hst _ observations ( rafanelli et al . 1997 ) suggested that the southern nucleus harbors an agn or a heavily obscured liner .",
    "the questions regarding the onset of starburst and agn activity and their evolution in mergers are of fundamental importance for our understanding of agn / black hole formation and evolution in general . given the complex nature of the x - ray emission of ngc6240 with contributions from many components suggested from previous x - ray observations ( schulz et al .",

    ", we report the _ chandra _ discovery that _ both _ nuclei of ngc6240 are active , and we show first results on the remarkably structure - rich extended x - ray emission .    luminosities were calculated using a hubble constant of @xmath3 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 . at a distance of ngc6240 of 144 mpc",
    ", 1@xmath2 corresponds to 700 pc in the galaxy .",
    "ngc6240 was observed as part of the guaranteed time observer program with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis - s ) instrument onboard the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory .",
    "the observation was carried out on july 29 , 2001 with an effective exposure time of 37 ks .",
    "the pointing of the telescope was such that the x - ray photons of the target source were registered on the back - illuminated s3 chip of acis .",
    "the data analysis was prepared using the ciao2.2 software tool .",
    "spectra were grouped to have at least 25 photons per bin . since few photons",
    "were detected below 0.5 kev , and since the instrument response is still somewhat uncertain at low energies , we restricted our modeling to photon energies above 0.5 kev .",
    "the acis - s background is very low .",
    "it was determined in a circular , source - free region north of the central x - ray emission , and was subtracted . in order to carry out the spectral analysis of each nucleus separately ,",
    "source photons from the northern and southern nucleus were extracted in circular regions of radii 0.8@xmath2 and 0.9@xmath2 respectively , centered at the x - ray positions of the nuclei .",
    "further details on photon extraction areas for other regions of ngc6240 are given below .",
    "the _ chandra _ image of ngc6240 reveals a wealth of structure , changing in dependence of energy ( fig .",
    "a large part of the x - ray emission of ngc6240 is extended , confirming previous results from _ rosat _ ( komossa et al .",
    "1998 , schulz et al . 1998 ) and a short _ chandra _ hrc - i observation ( lira et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the previous observations did not provide any energy information , though .",
    "several x - ray ` loops ' and knots are visible that correlate well with the h@xmath0 emission ( keel 1990 , gerssen et al .",
    "2001 ) of ngc6240 .",
    "apart from the complex central emission , only one x - ray source is detected within the optical confines of ngc6240 .",
    "its spectrum is rather hard .",
    "the source could be a background agn .",
    "in particular , the following features stand out in energy images of ngc6240 :    ( 0.1 - 3.0)kev : below 0.5 kev , barely any x - ray photons are detected .",
    "this can be traced back to the high absorption toward ngc6240 . above 0.5 kev ,",
    "extended , loop - like emission and several knots appear , prominent below 2.5 kev .",
    "of special interest is the ` blob ' south - west of the southern nucleus , which appears above 1 kev ( fig . 1 , fig .",
    "it is the strongest feature between 1.0 and 1.5 kev and is spatially extended . inspecting",
    "_ hst _ images ( gerssen et al . 2001 ) , we find it correlates with a region of increased h@xmath0 emission , and may correspond to a more recent superwind outflow than the more widely extended structures .",
    "above 1.5 kev , x - ray emission from the direction of the northern nucleus of ngc6240 starts to emerge .",
    "( 5.0 - 8.0)kev : the hard x - ray image is dominated by emission from two compact sources ( fig . 2 , 3 ) , spatially coincident within the errors with the ir position of the two nuclei of ngc6240 . with a distance of 1.4 arcseconds , the x - ray nuclei are slightly closer together than the optical nuclei ( fig .",
    "2 ) , consistent with the previous interpretation that extinction causes a wavelength - dependent shift in the flux centroids of the nuclei ( schulz et al .",
    "both nuclei show emission from the neutral iron line .",
    "the southern nucleus is more prominent in this line than the northern nucleus . running a standard source detection routine ,",
    "both nuclei are detected as sources in the energy interval 5 - 8kev with signal / noise ratios of 9.9 ( southern nucleus ) and 3.5 .",
    "we do not detect any x - ray emission from the location of the steep off - nuclear velocity gradient ( bland - hawthorn , wilson & tully 1991 , gerssen et al .",
    "2001 ) , which was recently suggested to be possibly due to a kinematic gradient in a starburst wind .",
    "no correlation of x - ray emission with the radio - arm west of the nuclei , described by colbert et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and suggested to be linked to superwind activity , was found .",
    "finally , no x - ray point source was detected from the direction of the supernova sn2000bg .",
    "representative of the extended emission , we report here results of spectral fits to the north - eastern - loop extended emission ( fig .",
    "source photons were extracted from an elliptical region centered at ra=16:52:59.3 , dec=02:24:08.1 ( ellipse radii : 8.9@xmath2 and 10.6@xmath2 , angle=45@xmath5 ) .",
    "we find that the x - ray spectrum is well described by a mekal model ( mewe et al .",
    "1995 ) with @xmath6 kev and absorption with column density @xmath7 @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , which exceeds the galactic value in the direction of ngc6240 , @xmath10 @xmath8 , and is consistent with optical estimates of the extinction toward the extended optical emission of @xmath11 1 mag ( thronson et al .",
    "metal abundances approach 0.1@xmath12solar .    secondly , the ` blob ' south - west of the southern nucleus was fit after extracting its photons from a circular region centered at ra=16:52:58.8 , dec=02:24:1.5 .",
    "its spectrum is significantly harder and more heavily absorbed .",
    "spectral fits consisting of a two - component mekal model were applied . among these two components ,",
    "one was assumed to be the extension of the widely extended soft x - ray emission of ngc6240 part of which is projected onto the central region of ngc6240 .",
    "explicitly , its parameters were all fixed to those determined for the north - eastern - loop extended x - ray emission ( including abundances and the amount of absorption ) , apart from the normalization that was treated as free parameter .",
    "the second , hotter , mekal component was added to describe the x - ray emission from the south - western blob itself . the spectrum of the south - western blob is then well described by a mekal model with @xmath13 kev and @xmath14 @xmath8 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "abundances are not well constrained , but are close to 0.8@xmath12solar and were thus fixed to that value .",
    "two circular regions centered at the southern and northern nucleus were selected for spectral analysis . the residual soft starburst emission projected onto the nuclei ( fig .",
    "1 ) was fit by a mekal model , its normalization and temperature left free to vary .",
    "the derived temperature ( @xmath16kev ) is consistent within the errors with that of the north - eastern loop emission .",
    "the extinction toward the nuclei estimated from ir observations , @xmath17=5.8 mag and @xmath18=1.6 mag ( tecza et al .",
    "2000 ) , corresponds to absorption column densities of @xmath19 = 10@xmath20 @xmath8 and @xmath21 = 2.810@xmath22 @xmath8 , and is expected to be the minimum amount of absorption along the line of sight towards the nuclei .",
    "merlin radio observations of neutral hydrogen toward the radio nuclei of ngc6240 indicate column densities of order @xmath23 @xmath8 ( beswick et al . 2001 ) .",
    "both nuclei show very hard x - ray spectra extending out to @xmath1 8 - 9kev .",
    "if the spectra are fit by a single powerlaw , strong residuals around the location of the neutral 6.4kev iron k@xmath0 line are visible , and further weaker ones around @xmath16.95kev .",
    "the energy of the second line is close to h - like iron and k@xmath24 of neutral iron .",
    "the southern nucleus is brighter in x - rays than the northern nucleus .",
    "its spectrum is well fit by a very flat powerlaw of photon index ( defined as in @xmath25 ) @xmath26 , and two narrow iron lines at energies corresponding to neutral and h - like iron ( fig .",
    "the emission is dominated by the neutral iron line that is located at a ( redshift - corrected ) energy @xmath27=6.42@xmath28 kev , with 1.510@xmath29 ph@xmath8s@xmath4 .",
    "the amount of excess absorption is not well constrained .",
    "it is of order @xmath30 @xmath8 and is uncertain by at least a factor 2 .",
    "the spectrum of the northern nucleus is less hard and less absorbed .",
    "it is well described by a powerlaw of photon index @xmath31 , absorbed with @xmath32 @xmath8 in addition to the galactic @xmath33 , and a narrow fek@xmath0 line of neutral iron ( fig .",
    "4 ) that is about a factor 3 weaker than in the southern nucleus .",
    "the absorption corrected fluxes in the ( 0.2 - 10)kev band are @xmath34 erg@xmath8s@xmath4 and @xmath35 erg@xmath8s@xmath4 for southern and northern nucleus , respectively .",
    "could the widely extended x - ray emission of ngc6240 still be powered by photoionization of the active nuclei ? _ chandra _ recently found some cases in which photoionization seems to dominate the ionization of circum - nuclear matter out to large distances ( @xmath1 2kpc in case of ngc1068 ; young , wilson & shopbell 2001 ) .",
    "however , the correlation of x - ray and h@xmath0 emission in combination with the _ soft _ , thermal - plasma - like spectrum of the extended emission of ngc6240 strongly favors starburst - driven superwinds ( heckman , armus & miley 1987 ) as the origin for the bulk of the extended x - ray emission of ngc6240 . according to superwind models of schulz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , a mechanical input power of @xmath36 erg / s ( derived from a sn - rate of 3/year ) can , within 3@xmath37 yrs , drive a single shell to an extent of @xmath38 10kpc within a medium of 0.1 @xmath39 particle density .",
    "this model reproduces the observed x - ray luminosity of the extended emission of @xmath110@xmath40 erg / s .",
    "a distance of 10 kpc corresponds to the extent of the five - finger structure seen in h@xmath0 , coincident with the brightest extended x - ray emission , including a correction for a disk inclined by up to 40@xmath5 from edge - on .",
    "the ionized iron line observed in addition to the neutral iron line may originate in ` cas - a - type ' supernova remnants ( e.g. , willingale et al .",
    "2002 ) , or in a near - nuclear ` warm scatterer ' that is ionized by the agn ( komossa et al 1998 ) .    the extended soft x - ray component and its link with non - x - ray morphological structures will be further discussed in a follow - up paper ( komossa et al .",
    ", in prep . ) . in the following , we concentrate on the core region of ngc6240 .",
    "using _ chandra _ acis - s , we found that _ both _ nuclei of ngc6240 are emitters of luminous hard x - ray emission , on which a strong neutral iron k@xmath0 line is superposed .",
    "these properties identify both nuclei of ngc6240 as active .",
    "in particular , a strong , neutral fe k@xmath0 line is not produced in a starburst - superwind , but originates from fluorescence in cold material illuminated by a hard continuum spectrum . for the first time , we can disentangle the contribution to the hard x - ray luminosity from the southern and northern nucleus . the observed ( 0.1 - 10)kev , absorption - corrected , fluxes convert to _ observed _ x - ray luminosities of the southern and northern nucleus , @xmath41 erg / s , @xmath42 erg / s , respectively .    the _ intrinsic _ luminosities are significantly larger , because it has been repeatedly argued that the emission we are seeing in x - rays below 10 kev is scattered emission from the agn ( e.g. , mitsuda et al .",
    "1995 , schulz et al .",
    "1998 , komossa et al .",
    "the intrinsic agn emission of ngc6240 only shows up above @xmath19 - 10 kev ( vignati et al .",
    "1999 , ikebe et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the strength of the neutral fe k@xmath0 line in both nuclei suggests a scattering geometry for _ both _ agn .",
    "this is also indicated by the flatness of the hard powerlaw spectra ( sect .",
    "we find marginal evidence that part of the hard emission is extended by few arcsesonds .",
    "3@xmath2 correspond to @xmath12 kpc in ngc6240 .",
    "it is interesting to note that this scale is similar to the extent of the hard x - ray emission and iron line of ngc1068 detected with _",
    "chandra _ ( young , wilson & shopbell 2001 ) .",
    "dense cold gas that could provide the scattering agent is abundant in the center region of ngc6240 .",
    "deeper _ chandra _ observations of ngc6240 , still employing the superb imaging spectroscopy capabilities of the acis - s detector , will be indispensable for studying the complex central region of ngc6240 in greater detail ; for instance to obtain a high - quality image in the fek@xmath0 line .",
    "ultimately , the binary agn of ngc6240 will coalesce to form one nucleus .",
    "the final merging of the supermassive black holes is expected to produce a strong gravitational wave signal .",
    "in fact , such events are expected to generate the clearest signals detectable with the gravitational wave detector lisa that will be placed in earth orbit in the near future ( e.g. , danzmann 1996 ) .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank reinhard genzel for his comments and encouragement , elisa costantini for discussions about the _ chandra _ analysis of extended sources , and an anonymous referee for his / her many useful comments and suggestions ."
