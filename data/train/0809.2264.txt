    "in this paper we ask how much entanglement is required to perform a measurement on a pair of spatially separated systems , if the participants are allowed only local operations and classical communication .",
    "that is , we want to find the `` entanglement cost '' of a given measurement .",
    "( we give a precise definition of this term in the following subsection . )",
    "our motivation can be traced back to a 1999 paper entitled `` quantum nonlocality without entanglement '' , which presents a complete orthogonal measurement that can not be performed using only local operations and classical communication ( locc ) , even though the eigenstates of the measurement are all unentangled @xcite .",
    "that result shows that there can be a kind of nonlocality in a quantum measurement that is not captured by the entanglement of the associated states . here",
    "we wish to quantify this nonlocality for specific measurements . though the measurements we consider here have outcomes associated with _",
    "entangled _ states , we find that the entanglement cost of the measurement often exceeds the entanglement of the states themselves .",
    "the 1999 paper just cited obtained an upper bound on the cost of the specific nonlocal measurement presented there , a bound that has recently been improved and generalized by cohen @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are in the literature at least three other avenues of research that bear on the problem of finding the entanglement cost of nonlocal measurements .",
    "first , there are several papers that simplify or extend the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , for example by finding other examples of measurements with product - state outcomes that can not be carried out locally @xcite",
    ". a related line of research asks whether or not a given set of orthogonal bipartite or multipartite states ( not necessarily a complete basis , and not necessarily unentangled ) can be distinguished by locc @xcite , and if not , how well one _ can _ distinguish the states by such means @xcite .",
    "finally , a number of authors have investigated the cost in entanglement , or the entanglement production capacity , of various bipartite and multipartite operations @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider three specific cases : ( i ) a class of orthogonal measurements on two qubits , in which the four eigenstates are equally entangled , ( ii ) a somewhat broader class of orthogonal measurements with unequal entanglements , and ( iii ) a general , nonorthogonal , bipartite measurement in @xmath0 dimensions that is invariant under all local pauli operations .",
    "for the first of our three cases we present upper and lower bounds on the entanglement cost .",
    "for the second case we obtain a lower bound , and for the last case we compute the cost exactly : it is equal to the average entanglement of the states associated with the outcomes . throughout the paper ,",
    "we mark our main results as propositions .",
    "the upper bound in case ( i ) can be obtained directly from a protocol devised by berry @xcite  a refinement of earlier protocols @xcite  for performing a closely related nonlocal unitary transformation .",
    "our bound is therefore the same as berry s bound .",
    "however , because we are interested in performing a measurement rather than a unitary transformation , we give an alternative protocol consisting of a sequence of local measurements .",
    "to get our lower bounds , we use a method developed in papers on the local distinguishability of bipartite states @xcite .",
    "the average entanglement between two parties can not be increased by locc ; so in performing the measurement , the participants must consume at least as much entanglement as the measurement can produce .",
    "this fact is the basis of all but one of our lower bounds .",
    "the one exception is in section iii , where we use a more stringent condition , a bound on the success probability of local entanglement manipulation , to put a tighter bound on the cost for a limited class of procedures .      to define the entanglement cost , we imagine two participants , alice and bob , each holding one of the two objects to be measured .",
    "we allow them to do any sequence of local operations and classical communication , but we do not allow them to transmit quantum particles from one location to the other . rather , we give them , as a resource , arbitrary shared entangled states , and we keep track of the amount of entanglement they consume in performing the measurement .    at this point , though , we have a few options in defining the problem .",
    "do we try to find the cost of performing the measurement only once , or",
    "do we imagine that the same measurement will be performed many times ( on many different pairs of qubits ) and look for the asymptotic cost per trial ? and how do we quantify the amount of entanglement that is used up ? in this paper we imagine that alice and bob will perform the given measurement only once .",
    "( in making this choice we are following cohen @xcite . )",
    "however , we suppose that this measurement is one of many measurements they will eventually perform ( not necessarily repeating any one of the measurements and not necessarily knowing in advance what the future measurements will be ) , and we assume that they have a large supply of entanglement from which they will continue to draw as they carry out these measurements . in this",
    "setting it makes sense to use the standard measure of entanglement for pure states , namely , the entropy of either of the two parts @xcite .",
    "thus , for a pure state @xmath1 of a bipartite system ab , the entanglement is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the reduced density matrix of particle a : @xmath4 . in this paper ,",
    "the logarithm will always be base two ; so the entanglement is measured in ebits . by means of local operations and classical communication , alice and bob can create from their large supply of entanglement any specific state that they need .",
    "for example , if they create and completely use up a copy of the state @xmath5 , this counts as a cost of @xmath6 . on the other hand ,",
    "if their procedure converts an entangled state into a less entangled state , the cost is the difference , that is , the amount of entanglement lost . a general measurement is specified by a povm ,",
    "that is , a collection of positive semi - definite operators @xmath7 that sum to the identity , each operator being associated with one of the outcomes of the measurement . in this paper we restrict our attention to _ complete _ measurements , that is , measurements in which each operator is of rank one ; so each @xmath7 is of the form @xmath8 for some @xmath9 in the range @xmath10 . in a complete _ orthogonal _ measurement ,",
    "each operator is a projection operator ( @xmath11 ) that projects onto a single vector ( an eigenvector @xmath12 of the measurement ) .",
    "now , actually performing a measurement will always entail performing some operation on the measured system .",
    "all that we require of this operation is that alice and bob both end up with an accurate classical record of the outcome of the measurement .",
    "in particular , we do not insist that the measured system be collapsed into some particular state or even that it survive the measurement .",
    "we allow the possibility of probabilistic measurement procedures , in which the probabilities might depend on the initial state of the system being measured .",
    "however , we do not want our quantification of the cost of a measurement to depend on this initial state ; we are trying to characterize the measurement itself , not the system on which it is being performed .",
    "so we assume that alice and bob are initially completely ignorant of the state of the particles they are measuring .",
    "that is , the state they initially assign to these particles is the completely mixed state .",
    "this is the state we will use in computing any probabilities associated with the procedure .    bringing together the above considerations",
    ", we now give the definition of the quantity we are investigating in this paper . given a povm @xmath13 , let @xmath14 be the set of all locc procedures @xmath15 such that ( i ) @xmath15 uses pure entangled pairs , local operations , and classical communication , and ( ii ) @xmath15 realizes @xmath13 exactly , in the sense that for any initial state of the system to be measured , @xmath15 yields classical outcomes with probabilities that agree with the probabilities given by @xmath13 .",
    "then @xmath16 , the entanglement cost of a measurement @xmath13 , is defined to be    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the total entanglement of all the resource states used in the procedure , @xmath19 is the distillable entanglement of the state remaining at the end of the procedure @xcite , and @xmath20 indicates an average over all the possible results of @xmath15 , when the system on which the measurement is being performed is initially in the completely mixed state .",
    "( though we allow and take into account the possibility of some residual entanglement @xmath19 , in all the procedures we consider explicitly in this paper , the entanglement in the resource states will in fact be used up completely . )",
    "a different notion of the entanglement cost of a measurement is considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely , the amount of entanglement needed to effect a naimark extension of a given povm . in that case",
    "the entanglement is between the system on which the povm is to be performed and an ancillary system needed to make the measurement orthogonal . for any orthogonal",
    "measurement , and indeed for all the measurements considered in this paper , the entanglement cost in the sense of ref .",
    "@xcite is zero .",
    "one way to perform a nonlocal orthogonal measurement on a bipartite system is to perform a nonlocal unitary transformation that takes the eigenstates of the desired measurement into the standard basis , so that the measurement can then be finished locally .",
    "( we will use this fact in section ii . )",
    "so one might wonder whether the problem we are investigating in this paper , at least for the case of orthogonal measurements , is equivalent to the problem of finding the cost of a nonlocal unitary transformation .",
    "a simple example shows that the two problems are distinct .",
    "suppose that alice holds two qubits , labeled a@xmath21 and a , and bob holds a single qubit labeled b. they want to perform an orthogonal measurement having the following eight eigenstates .",
    "@xmath22 here the order of the qubits in each ket is a@xmath21 , a , b. alice and bob can carry out this measurement by the following protocol : alice measures qubit a@xmath21 in the standard basis .",
    "if she gets the outcome @xmath23 , she and bob can finish the measurement locally .",
    "if , on the other hand , she gets the outcome @xmath24 , she uses up one ebit to teleport the state of qubit a to bob , who then finishes the measurement .",
    "the average cost of this protocol is 1/2 ebit , because the probability that alice will need to use an entangled pair is 1/2 .    on the other hand",
    ", one can show that any unitary transformation that could change the above basis into the standard basis would be able to create 1 ebit of entanglement and must therefore consume at least 1 ebit .",
    "so the cost of the measurement in this case is strictly smaller than the cost of a corresponding unitary transformation .",
    "the crucial difference is that when one does a unitary transformation , one can gain no information about the system being transformed .",
    "so there can be no averaging between easy cases and hard cases .",
    "there are two general bounds on @xmath16 , an upper bound and a lower bound , that apply to all complete bipartite measurements .",
    "these bounds are expressed in the following two propositions",
    ".    * proposition 1 .",
    "* let @xmath13 be a povm on two objects a and b , having state spaces of dimensions @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively .",
    "then @xmath27 .",
    "_ let alice and bob share , as a resource , a maximally entangled state of two @xmath25-dimensional objects .",
    "they can use this pair to teleport the state of a from alice to bob @xcite , who can then perform the measurement @xmath13 locally .",
    "the entanglement of the resource pair is @xmath28 .",
    "so @xmath28 ebits are sufficient to perform the measurement .",
    "similarly , @xmath29 ebits would be sufficient to teleport the state of b to alice .",
    "so the cost of @xmath13 is no greater than @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31    as we have mentioned , most of our lower bounds are obtained by considering the entanglement production capacity of our measurements .",
    "specifically , we imagine that in addition to particles a and b , alice and bob hold , respectively , auxiliary particles c and d. we consider an initial state of the whole system such that the measurement @xmath13 on ab collapses cd into a possibly entangled state @xcite .",
    "the average amount by which the measurement increases the entanglement between alice and bob is then a lower bound on @xmath16 .",
    "that is , @xmath32 in the proof of the following proposition , the initial entanglement is zero",
    ".    * proposition 2 .",
    "* let @xmath13 be a bipartite povm consisting of the operators @xmath8 , where each @xmath12 is a normalized state of particles a and b , each of which has a @xmath33-dimensional state space .",
    "then @xmath16 is at least as great as the average entanglement @xmath34 of the states @xmath12 .",
    "that is , @xmath35    _ proof .",
    "_ let the initial state of abcd be @xmath36 a tensor product of two maximally entangled states .",
    "note that the reduced density matrix of particles a and b is the completely mixed state , in accordance with our definition of the problem .",
    "when the measurement yields the outcome @xmath37 , its effect on @xmath38 can be expressed in the form @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the identity on cd , and the operators @xmath41 act on the state space of particles a and b , telling us what happens to the system when the @xmath37th outcome occurs .",
    "the trace of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ op ] ) is not unity but is the probability of the @xmath37th outcome .",
    "( note that @xmath41 may send states of ab to a different state space , including , for example , the state space of the system in which the classical record of the outcome is to be stored . the index @xmath42 is needed because the final state of the system when outcome @xmath37 occurs could be a mixed state . )",
    "the operators @xmath41 satisfy the condition @xmath43 applying the operation of eq .",
    "( [ op ] ) to the state of eq .",
    "( [ maxent ] ) , and then tracing out everything except particles c and d , one finds that these particles are left in the state @xmath44 where the asterisk indicates complex conjugation in the standard basis .",
    "this conjugation does not affect the entanglement ; so , when outcome @xmath37 occurs , particles c and d are left in a state with entanglement @xmath45 .",
    "the probability of this outcome is @xmath46 .",
    "so the average entanglement of cd after the measurement has been performed is the quantity @xmath47 of eq .",
    "( [ ave ] ) .",
    "but the average entanglement between alice s and bob s locations can not have increased as long as alice and bob were restricted to local operations and classical communication .",
    "so in the process of performing the measurement , alice and bob must have used up an amount of entanglement equal to or exceeding @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath31    in the following three sections we improve these two bounds for a specific measurement that we label @xmath48 , an orthogonal measurement on two qubits with eigenstates given by @xmath49 here @xmath50 and @xmath51 are nonnegative real numbers with @xmath52 and .",
    "section ii presents an improved upper bound for this measurement , section iii derives a lower bound for a restricted class of procedures , and section iv derives an absolute lower bound .",
    "we then consider a somewhat more general measurement in section v.    in section vi we exhibit a class of bipartite measurements , in dimension @xmath53 , for which we can find a procedure that achieves the lower bound of eq .",
    "( [ ave ] ) .",
    "as noted earlier , these are the povms that are invariant under all local pauli operations .",
    "one way to perform the measurement @xmath48 is to perform the following unitary transformation on the two qubits .",
    "@xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 , the matrix is written in the standard basis and the @xmath58 s are the usual pauli matrices , @xmath59 under this transformation , the four orthogonal states that define the measurement @xmath48 are transformed into @xmath60 so once the transformation has been done , the measurement @xmath48 can be completed locally ; alice and bob both make the measurement @xmath24 versus @xmath23 and tell each other their results .    the transformation @xmath61 is equivalent to one that has been analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite , all of which give procedures that are consistent with the rules we have set up for our problem ; that is , the procedures can be used to perform the measurement once , rather than asymptotically , using arbitrary entangled states as resources .",
    "( some of those papers consider the asymptotic problem , but their procedures also work in the setting we have adopted here . )",
    "it appears that the procedure presented by berry in ref .",
    "@xcite is the most efficient one known so far .",
    "it is a multi - stage procedure , involving at each stage a measurement that determines whether another stage , and another entangled pair , are needed .",
    "we now present a measurement - based protocol for performing @xmath48 .",
    "the protocol can be derived from berry s and yields the same upper bound on the cost , but we arrive at it in a different way that may have conceptual value in the analysis of other nonlocal measurements .",
    "the construction of the protocol begins with the following observations .",
    "if alice were to try to teleport her qubit to bob using as a resource an incompletely entangled pair , she would cause a nonunitary distortion in its state . with his qubit and",
    "alice s distorted qubit , bob could , with some probability less than one , successfully complete the measurement .",
    "however , if he gets the wrong outcome , he will destroy the information necessary to complete the measurement .",
    "we require the measurement always to be completed , so this protocol fails . on the other hand ,",
    "suppose alice , again using a partially entangled pair , performs an _",
    "teleportation , conveying to bob only one rather than two classical bits , and suppose bob similarly makes an incomplete measurement , extracting only one classical bit from his two qubits . in that case , if the incomplete measurements are chosen judiciously , a failure does not render the desired measurement impossible but only requires that alice and bob do a different nonlocal measurement on the qubits they now hold . in the following description of the protocol ,",
    "we have incorporated the unitary transformations associated with teleportation into the measurements themselves , so that the whole procedure is a sequence of local projective measurements .    like berry s protocol , our protocol consists a series of rounds , beginning with what we will call `` round one '' .    1 .",
    "alice and bob are given as a resource the entangled state @xmath62 , where the positive real numbers @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( with @xmath65 ) are to be determined by minimizing the eventual cost .",
    "thus each participant holds two qubits : the qubit to be measured and a qubit that is part of the shared resource .",
    "2 .   alice makes a binary measurement on her two qubits , defined by two orthogonal projection operators : @xmath66 here the bell states @xmath67 and @xmath68 are defined by @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "alice transmits ( classically ) the result of her measurement to bob .",
    "( here alice is doing the incomplete teleportation . in a complete teleportation",
    "she would also distinguish @xmath71 from @xmath72 , and @xmath73 from @xmath74 . )",
    "if alice gets the outcome @xmath15 , bob performs the following binary measurement on his two qubits : @xmath75 here @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , and the real coefficients @xmath80 and @xmath81 are obtained from @xmath82 and @xmath83 via the equation @xmath84 , together with the normalization condition .",
    "( these values are chosen so as to undo the distortion caused by alice s imperfect teleportation . ) on the other hand , if alice gets the outcome @xmath85 , bob performs a different binary measurement : @xmath86 here @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",
    "if alice and bob have obtained either of the outcomes @xmath91 or @xmath92 , which we call the `` good '' outcomes , they can now finish the desired measurement @xmath48 by making local measurements , with no further expenditure of entangled resources .",
    "for example , if they get the outcome @xmath91 , alice now distinguishes between @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( which span the subspace picked out by @xmath15 ) , and bob distinguishes between @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( which span the subspace picked out by @xmath95 ) .",
    "the total probability of getting one of the two good outcomes is @xmath96 on the other hand , if they have obtained one of the other two outcomes , @xmath97 or @xmath98the `` bad '' outcomes  they find that in order to finish the measurement @xmath48 on their _ original _ pair of qubits , they now have to perform a different measurement @xmath99 on the system that they now hold .",
    "( even though each participant started with two qubits , each of them has now distinguished a pair of two - dimensional subspaces , effectively removing one qubit s worth of quantum information .",
    "so the remaining quantum information on each side can be held in a single qubit . )",
    "the measurement @xmath99 has the same form as @xmath48 , but with new values @xmath100 and @xmath101 instead of @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the new values are determined by the equations @xmath102 in any case , alice and bob have now finished round one . if they have obtained one of the bad outcomes , they now have two choices : ( i ) begin again at step 1 but with the new values @xmath100 and @xmath101 , or ( ii ) use up a whole ebit to teleport alice s system to bob , who finishes the measurement locally .",
    "they choose the method that will ultimately be less costly in entanglement .",
    "if they choose option ( i ) , we say that they have begun round two .",
    "this procedure is iterated until the measurement is finished or until @xmath103 rounds have been completed , where @xmath103 is an integer chosen in advance . in round @xmath42 , the measurement parameter @xmath104 is determined from the parameters @xmath105 and @xmath106 used in the preceding round according to eq .",

    "@xcite , whose results likewise give a lower bound on the cost : @xmath128 ( where @xmath52 and @xmath129 ) .",
    "this bound is weaker than the one we have obtained , in part because we have followed the later paper ref .",
    "@xcite in assuming an initial pure state rather than a mixed state of abcd .",
    "here we consider a class of measurements for which the cost _ equals _ the average entanglement of the states associated with the povm elements .",
    "we begin with another two - qubit measurement , which we then generalize to arbitrary dimension .",
    "a measurement closely related to @xmath48 is measurement @xmath130 , which has eight outcomes , represented by a povm whose elements @xmath131 all have @xmath132 , with the eight states @xmath12 given by @xmath133 that is , they are the same states as in @xmath48 , plus the four states obtained by interchanging @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "thus , alice and bob could perform the measurement @xmath134 by flipping a fair coin to decide whether to perform @xmath48 or @xmath135 .",
    "this procedure yields the eight possible outcomes : there are two possible outcomes of the coin toss , and for each one , there are four possible outcomes of the chosen measurement .",
    "the coin toss requires no entanglement ; so the cost of this procedure is equal to the cost of @xmath48 ( which is equal to that of @xmath135 ) . we conclude that @xmath136 as we will see shortly , the cost of @xmath134 is in fact strictly smaller for @xmath137 .",

    "the corresponding povm element on the ab system is @xmath149 .",
    "continuing in this way , one finds the following correspondence between the 16 outcomes of the global measurement and the povm elements of the ab measurement .",

    "this is the same as the average entanglement of the eight states representing the outcomes of @xmath134 , which we know is a lower bound on the cost .",

    "we note that the povm @xmath134 is invariant under all local pauli operations .",
    "this fact leads us to ask whether , more generally , invariance under such operations guarantees that the entanglement cost of the measurement is exactly equal to the average entanglement of the states associated with the povm elements .",

    "* let @xmath13 be any complete povm with a finite number of outcomes , acting on a pair of systems each having a @xmath33-dimensional state space , such that @xmath13 is invariant under all local pauli operations , that is , under the group generated by @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 , and @xmath168 .",
    "then @xmath16 is equal to the average entanglement of the states associated with the outcomes of @xmath13 , as expressed in eq .",
    "( [ ave ] ) .    _ proof . _",
    "the most general such povm is similar to the one we have just considered , except that instead of a single starting state @xmath153 , there may be an ensemble of states @xmath169 with weights @xmath170 , @xmath171 , such that @xmath172 . the povm elements ( of which there are a total of @xmath173 )",
    "are @xmath174 , where @xmath175 ( so @xmath176 plays the role of @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ ave ] ) . ) in order to perform this measurement , alice and bob first make a random choice of the value of @xmath177 , using the weights @xmath170 .",
    "they then use , as a resource , particles c and d in the state @xmath178 , and perform bell measurements as above .",
    "the cost of this procedure is the average entanglement of the resource states , which is @xmath179 but we know that @xmath34 is a lower bound on @xmath16 .",
    "since the above procedure achieves this bound , we have that @xmath180 . @xmath31",
    "as we discussed in the introduction , a general lower bound on the entanglement cost of a complete measurement is the average entanglement of the pure states associated with the measurement s outcomes .",
    "perhaps the most interesting result of this paper is that , for almost all the orthogonal measurements we considered , the actual cost is strictly greater than this lower bound .",
    "the same is true in the examples of `` nonlocality without entanglement '' , in which the average entanglement is zero but the cost is strictly positive .",
    "however , whereas those earlier examples may have seemed special because of their intricate construction , the examples given here are quite simple .",
    "the fact that the cost in these simple cases exceeds the average entanglement of the states suggests that this feature may be a generic property of bipartite measurements .",
    "if this is true , then in this sense the nonseparability of a measurement is generically a distinct property from the the nonseparability of the eigenstates .",
    "( in this connection it is interesting that for certain questions of distinguishability of generic bipartite states , the presence or absence of entanglement seems to be completely irrelevant @xcite . )    we have also found a class of measurements for which the entanglement cost is _ equal to _ the average entanglement of the corresponding states .",
    "these measurements have a high degree of symmetry in that they are invariant under all local generalized pauli operations .",
    "what is it that causes some measurements to be `` more nonseparable '' than the states associated with their outcomes ?",
    "evidently the answer must have to do with the _ relationships _ among the states . in the original `` nonlocality without entanglement ''",
    "measurement , the crucial role of these relationships is clear : in order to separate any eigenstate @xmath181 from any other eigenstate @xmath182 by a local measurement , the observer must disturb some of the other states in such a way as to render them indistinguishable .",
    "one would like to have a similar understanding of the `` interactions '' among states when the eigenstates are entangled .",
    "some recent papers have quantified relational properties of ensembles of bipartite states @xcite .",
    "perhaps one of these approaches , or a different approach yet to be developed , will capture the aspect of these relationships that determines the cost of the measurement .",
