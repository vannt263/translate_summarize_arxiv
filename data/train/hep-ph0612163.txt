    "the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon represent a powerful tool to investigate the nucleon structure . in particular , a detailed knowledge of the responses of the nucleon to an electromagnetic probe can give useful information on the quark distributions inside the hadron state , together with an insight on the role played by the non - valence fock components . presently , the experimental investigation of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors poses various problems in both the spacelike ( sl ) and timelike ( tl ) regions . in particular",
    ", in the sl region the most striking observation is the discrepancy in the results obtained for the proton ratio @xmath6 between the data collected by the rosenbluth separation method and by the polarization transfer one @xcite . as to the tl region",
