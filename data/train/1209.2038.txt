    "in this paper , we analyse a stochastic generalisation of the abelian sandpile model ( asm ) .",
    "informally ( we provide a formal definition later ) , the asm operates on a graph where each vertex has a number of ` grains of sand ' on it . at every unit of time",
    ", another grain of sand is added at a random vertex @xmath5 . if this causes the number of grains at @xmath5 to exceed its degree , @xmath5 topples , sending one grain to each of its neighbours .",
    "this may cause other vertices to topple , and we continue until the configuration is stable , i.e. no vertex can topple anymore .",
    "a special vertex , the sink , can absorb any number of grains and never topples .",
    "it is possible to show that eventually this model will be trapped in a set of configurations , called recurrent configurations .",
    "this model arose from work by bak , tang and wiesenfeld @xcite and was named and formalised by dhar @xcite .",
    "it displays a phenomenon known as self - organised criticality @xcite , in which characteristic length or time scales break down in the ` critical ' steady state .",
    "when this happens , the correlation between the number of grains at two vertices obeys a power - law decay , as opposed to an exponential decay often found in models away from criticality .",
    "likewise , the average number of topplings that result from a single grain addition also obeys a power - law distribution . in this sense ,",
    "the model is ` non - local ' , as grains added at a vertex may have an effect on vertices that are far away .",
    "physically , this model ( and self - organised criticality in general ) has been used in applications as wide as forest fires @xcite , earthquakes @xcite and sediment deposits @xcite .",
    "mathematically , the asm has been heavily studied , and we shall not list out all the references here .",
    "we refer interested readers to dhar s papers @xcite and to the excellent review on the subject by redig @xcite . some relevant results to our current work discussed in @xcite include :    * the number of recurrent configurations is equal to the number of spanning trees of the graph .",
    "* there is an algorithm ( called the _ burning algorithm _ ) which determines if a given configuration is recurrent or not .",
    "this finds , or establishes the non - existence of , a subgraph not including the sink on which the configuration is stable .",
    "this algorithm constructively establishes a bijection between recurrent configurations and spanning trees . * in the steady state of the model , each recurrent configuration is equally likely .    in the asm",
    ", the only randomness occurs in the vertices that we add grains to .",
    "we introduce a variation on this model , where the topplings themselves are also random .",
    "more precisely , we fix a probability @xmath1 $ ] , and when a site is unstable , each neighbour independently has a probability @xmath6 of receiving a grain from the unstable site . in this way",
    ", an unstable site may remain unstable after toppling but , as in the original model , the process continues until the configuration is stable . if @xmath2 , this is identical to the asm .",
    "although this new model appears similar to the asm , a closer inspection reveals some qualitative differences . in particular , the model will again become trapped in a set of recurrent configurations , but this set is not equal to the set of recurrent configurations in the asm .",
    "furthermore , each recurrent configuration is not equally likely , and the steady state measure now depends on @xmath6 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the behaviour of this new model , particularly in these respects .",
    "we prove a characterisation of the recurrent configurations in terms of orientations of the graph edges , and provide a  tutte polynomial - like \" formula which counts these configurations in terms of their numbers of grains of sand .",
    "the stochastic sandpile model ( ssm ) we propose is an appropriate generalisation of the asm , due to the aforementioned relation between the tutte polynomial and a counting of the recurrent configurations .",
    "a similar result has been proved by lpez @xcite for the asm ; in this model , the lacking polynomial we define later has an expression using the `` standard '' tutte polynomial if the number of lacking particles is @xmath7 . ] .",
    "see also cori and le borgne @xcite and bernardi @xcite for combinatorial explanations of this fact .",
    "although several instances of random sandpile models have already been introduced in the literature ( see for example dhar ( * ? ? ? * section 6 ) , kloster _",
    "@xcite , manna @xcite ) , as far as we are aware none of these models have any known link with tutte - like polynomials .",
    "variations on the basic sandpile model also include an asymmetric version @xcite , which devised an analogous algorithm to the burning algorithm called the _ script algorithm_.    in section [ sec : model ] , we formally define the asm and introduce our stochastic generalisation of it ( the ssm ) . in section [ sec : result ] , we present our results on the ssm , giving detailed proofs in section [ sec : proof ] .",
    "finally , we offer a brief conclusion in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we formally define our model and its associated notation . we start with a brief review of the established abelian sandpile model .",
    "we first define the class of graphs @xmath8 that underly the model .",
    "@xmath0 must be finite , unoriented , connected and loop - free .",
    "it may have multiple edges , and it contains a distinguished vertex @xmath9 that we call the _ sink_. the set of these graphs is denoted @xmath10 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath11 to denote that @xmath12 and @xmath5 are adjacent in @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath13 .    a sandpile _ configuration _ on @xmath0 is a vector @xmath14 .",
    "the number @xmath15 represents the number of grains of sand present at the vertex @xmath5 in the configuration @xmath16 .",
    "when this number exceeds a certain threshold , the vertex is said to be _ unstable _ , and will _",
    "topple _ , sending one grain of sand to each of its neighbours . typically and throughout this paper , the threshold",
    "is set to the degree of that vertex .",
    "the sink plays a special role in that it can absorb any number of grains , and as such never topples .",
    "two different configurations play an important role in this paper .",
    "the first one @xmath17 ( or @xmath18 when @xmath0 is clear from the context ) is the configuration ^_g:=(d^g(v ) , v v ) , where @xmath19 is the degree of the vertex @xmath5 in @xmath0 .",
    "the second one is @xmath20 for some vertex @xmath21 in @xmath22 , _",
    "a:=(_a , v , v v ) , where @xmath23 is the kronecker symbol , meaning that all co - ordinates of @xmath20 are 0 except for at position @xmath21 , where it is 1 .    a configuration @xmath24 is called _ stable _ if @xmath25 for all @xmath26 .",
    "we write @xmath27 for the set of all stable configurations on @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath17 is clearly the maximum stable configuration in terms of the total number of grains in the configuration .",
    "now define the toppling operator @xmath28 corresponding to a toppling at @xmath29 by [ eq : full - toppling ] t_x()=- d^g(x)_x+_y~x , ys _ y , where configurations are added site - by - site . a toppling @xmath28 is called _ legal _ if @xmath30 .",
    "we now define for any configuration @xmath16 its _ stabilisation _ @xmath31 as follows .",
    "if @xmath16 is stable , then @xmath32 ; otherwise  ( ) = t_x_m( ... (t_x_1 ( ) ) ... ) , with the requirements that @xmath33 is a sequence of legal topplings , and that the configuration @xmath31 is stable .",
    "the fact that this operator is well - defined , i.e. the stabilisation of a configuration is independent of the order of the topplings that is used to stabilise it , is not immediately obvious .",
    "we refer the interested reader to proposition 3.7 ( and lemma 3.6 ) in redig @xcite .",
    "the asm has a markov chain structure which is defined as follows .",
    "assume that there are defined some i.i.d .",
    "random variables @xmath34 taking their values in @xmath22 according to a distribution @xmath35 ( where the support of @xmath35 is @xmath22 ) , defined on a common probability space @xmath36 .",
    "the sandpile process starts from any stable configuration @xmath37 .",
    "we define a markov chain @xmath38 with values in @xmath27 . given @xmath39 for any @xmath40 , @xmath41 is obtained as follows :    * add a grain at position @xmath42 to the configuration @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath43 be the obtained configuration .",
    "* let @xmath41 be the stabilisation of @xmath44 , that is @xmath45 ( in some cases no toppling is needed ) .",
    "since a grain can be added anywhere with positive probability , it is immediately seen that from any configuration @xmath16 , the maximal configuration @xmath46 can be reached with positive probability .",
    "it follows that the set of recurrent configurations for the markov chain is the unique recurrent class containing the maximal configuration .",
    "we denote this set by @xmath47 , and as previously noted , it is in bijection with the set of spanning trees of @xmath0 ( see redig @xcite ) .      in this model",
    ", we make the topplings random .",
    "a probability @xmath1 $ ] is fixed , and when a site is unstable , each neighbour independently has a probability @xmath6 of receiving a grain from the unstable site . in this way ,",
    "an unstable site may remain unstable after toppling , but as in the original model , the process continues until the configuration is stable .",
    "different topplings are done independently . if @xmath2 , this reduces to the asm ,",
    "so we assume this is not the case .",
    "there are some slight difficulties in establishing that this model is indeed well - defined .",
    "two of them are taken into account in the proof of theorem [ thm : well - defi ] below .",
    "a third one arises by noticing that topplings commute in the asm .",
    "however , in the ssm , when two legal topplings are possible , it is not clear that they commute , since we only talk about what to do  in probability \" . to solve this",
    ", we describe a probability space where the laws of the topplings are indeed those discussed at the beginning of this section and for which the commutation of legal topplings takes place as needed .",
    "we now give a formal definition of the ssm .",
    "the definition of terms introduced in relation to the asm , apart from the toppling operator , are unchanged .",
    "all the random variables discussed below are defined on a common probability space @xmath36 , and they are all independent .    * the variables @xmath48 are distributed according to a distribution @xmath35 with support equal to @xmath22 . as before ,",
    "they represent a sequence of arrival places of grains . * for any @xmath49 such that @xmath50 and any @xmath51 , @xmath52 is a bernoulli random variable with parameter @xmath6 .",
    "it represents the number of particles going from @xmath53 to @xmath54 along @xmath55 due to the @xmath56th toppling of @xmath53 .",
    "we now define @xmath57 as the @xmath56th toppling at @xmath29 ^(i)_x()=- _ e xb_i(x , e ) _ x + _ y s , e=\\{x , y } eb_i(x , e)_y",
    ". we will call any realisation of such a toppling a _",
    "stochastic toppling_. note that with positive probability , the @xmath56th toppling at @xmath5 is a _ full toppling , meaning that @xmath58 , in which case @xmath57 coincides with the asm toppling @xmath28 .",
    "_    on the probability space @xmath59 , the ssm is well defined when a starting configuration is specified .",
    "we then use the same definition of a legal toppling , and define the stabilisation of a configuration @xmath16 by ( ) = _",
    "x_n( ... (_x_1 ( ) ) ... ) , where we take @xmath60 if the vertex @xmath61 appears exactly @xmath62 times in the sequence of topplings @xmath63 , and with the same requirements as for the asm , i.e. that @xmath64 is a legal sequence of topplings and @xmath65 is stable .",
    "the notation @xmath66 stands for the `` random stabilisation '' we define .",
    "[ thm : well - defi ] for any graph @xmath0 in @xmath10 , the stabilisation operator @xmath66 is almost surely well - defined .",
    "two things have to be shown .",
    "the first one is that the stabilisation process eventually ends . here , as opposed to the asm",
    ", a loop may appear in the toppling process .",
    "for example ,",
    "if @xmath67 and @xmath21 and @xmath68 are both unstable , and for all @xmath56 we have @xmath69 and @xmath70 , then a repeated loop occurs where @xmath21 only sends one grain to @xmath68 and @xmath68 only sends one grain to @xmath21 , _",
    "ad infinitum_. this example is obviously contrived , and it is easy to see that this occurs with probability 0 , but some more complex loops could occur .    to show that this almost surely does not happen , we note that in the asm , stabilisation takes a finite number of topplings regardless of the initial configuration .",
    "let @xmath71 be the maximum number of full topplings at @xmath5 needed ( by the asm ) to stabilise any configuration arising from the addition of 1 grain to a stable configuration ; let @xmath72 .",
    "since there are a finite number of such configurations , @xmath73 is finite .",
    "now for any @xmath56 and @xmath53 , @xmath57 is the `` full toppling '' @xmath28 with positive probability .",
    "a simple renewal argument shows that in an infinite sequence of topplings , the number of full topplings done at every vertex is almost surely larger than @xmath73 . from here",
    "the conclusion follows ( note that this does nt mean that full topplings are needed to stabilise a configuration ) .",
    "the second thing we have to prove is that that the stabilisation operator is well - defined ; that is , starting from an unstable configuration @xmath16 , changing the order of the site stabilisations does not change the final result @xmath65 .",
    "this is the case on @xmath36 since whatever is done elsewhere , the @xmath56th toppling at @xmath5 is @xmath74 .",
    "we can then use the same argument as in lemma 3.6 and proposition 3.7 of redig @xcite , with a simple adjustment to take into account the fact that @xmath75 is not constant .",
    "the ssm has a markov chain structure which is analogous to the asm .",
    "the sandpile process starts from any stable configuration @xmath37 .",
    "we define a markov chain @xmath38 with values in @xmath27 . given @xmath39 for any @xmath40 , we obtain @xmath41 as follows :    * add a grain at position @xmath42 to the configuration @xmath39 . let @xmath43 be the resulting configuration .",
    "* let @xmath41 be the stabilisation of @xmath44 , that is @xmath76 ( in some cases no toppling is needed ) .",
    "note that @xmath66 is not defined _ ex nihilo _ as in the asm .",
    "on @xmath36 , when @xmath66 is applied , its action depends on all the previous topplings taken to reach the current state . in view of this",
    ", it is more proper to write @xmath77 or even @xmath78 instead of @xmath66 .",
    "however , for the sake of brevity we write @xmath66 instead .    once again , since the support of @xmath35 is @xmath22 , the maximal configuration @xmath46 is recurrent , and the set of recurrent configurations for the markov chain is the unique recurrent class containing @xmath46 .",
    "we denote this set by @xmath79 , and call any element of it _ stochastically recurrent _ ( or _ sr _ ) .",
    "we call the configurations which are recurrent under the asm _ deterministically recurrent _ or _ dr _ in contrast .    [ ds ] for any @xmath80 , @xmath81    this is easily seen because @xmath82 always uses a finite number of topplings . when constructing a stochastic stabilisation ,",
    "the deterministic stabilisation must have a positive probability of being reconstructed using only full topplings .",
    "the two sets @xmath47 and @xmath79 are not equal in general .",
    "a simple counter - example is shown in figure [ fig : triangle ] .",
    "for this graph , the configuration which has @xmath83 grains at each vertex is sr .",
    "it can be reached from the dr configuration @xmath84 $ ] ( with 3 grains at the vertex @xmath85 leading to the sink ) , by adding a grain to @xmath85 and toppling it , sending one grain to the sink and one to @xmath86 .",
    "however , it is not dr as it fails the burning algorithm test  the graph with the sink removed is a forbidden subconfiguration .        to determine @xmath79 ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath16 is sr if and only if there exists a finite sequence of adding of grains and topplings such that @xmath16 is reached from @xmath46 through this sequence . in the rest of the paper ,",
    "we prove a more useful characterisation of the stochastically recurrent states .",
    "in this section , we state the main results of this paper .",
