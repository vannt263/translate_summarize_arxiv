    "<S> the cosmological ( upper ) limit on the peccei - quinn constant , related to the primordial oscillations of the axion field , can be relaxed for a mirror axion model . </S>",
    "<S> the simple reason is that the mirror world is colder and so the behavior of the axion temperature - dependent mass is dominated by the contribution from the mirror sector . </S>",
    "<S> so the coherent oscillations start earlier and correspondingly the axion mass density @xmath0 is reduced .    </S>",
    "<S> the cp violating term @xmath1 , in the qcd lagrangian , leads to observable effects ( e.g. non zero neutron electric dipole moment ) , experimentally not observed . </S>",
    "<S> this fact is referred to as the strong cp problem ( for a general reference see ref .  ) .    in the peccei - quinn ( pq ) </S>",
    "<S> mechanism,@xcite which is the most appealing solution of this problem , the parameter @xmath2 becomes a dynamical field , the axion @xmath3 , whose potential is minimized for the cp even configuration @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the axion emerges as the pseudo - goldstone mode of a spontaneously broken global axial symmetry @xmath5 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 is a constant , with dimension of energy , called the pq constant , and @xmath7 stands for the color anomaly of @xmath5 current.@xcite in the following , we will usually refer to the constant @xmath8 , which characterizes the axion phenomenology . </S>",
    "<S> astrophysical considerations exclude all the value of @xmath9 up to @xmath10 gev.@xcite on the other hand , the cosmological limit , related to the primordial oscillations of the axion field , demands the upper bound @xmath11 </S>",
    "<S> gev.@xcite let us briefly review the origin of this last limit .    in most axion models , </S>",
    "<S> the pq symmetry breaking occurs when a complex scalar field , @xmath12 , which carries pq charge , acquires a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs as the temperature of the universe cools down below the value of the pq temperature . </S>",
    "<S> as said , the axion is identified with the angular degree of freedom @xmath14 . today </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 is settled in the cp - conserving minimum @xmath15 . however , after the pq symmetry breaking , as the temperature is of the order of the pq scale , the axion is massless and the initial value of the phase @xmath2 is chosen stochastically . </S>",
    "<S> we indicate this initial value with @xmath16 .    when the universe is cold enough for the qcd phase transition , instanton effects curve the potential so that the axion acquires a non zero mass @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the zero temperature limit:@xcite @xmath19 the function @xmath20 for temperature @xmath21 ( @xmath22 mev is the qcd scale ) was calculated in ref .   and can be approximated as:@xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> this power law is valid when @xmath26 while for @xmath27 we have @xmath28 and the mass becomes independent of the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we use this relation until @xmath29 , that is until @xmath30 mev , and assume that @xmath31 for @xmath32 .    </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath2 starts to roll down , slowed by the hubble expansion , following the equation : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the hubble expansion rate . </S>",
    "<S> when the curvature term dominates on the ( hubble ) friction term , @xmath2 begins to oscillate with the frequency @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> this happens at the temperature value @xmath36 defined by the equation @xmath37 , where @xmath38 gev is the plank mass and @xmath39 is the effective number of the particle degrees of freedom at @xmath36 . for @xmath40 gev , 86.25 for 100 gev @xmath41 5 gev , 75.75 for 5 gev @xmath41 2 gev , 61.75 for 2 gev @xmath42 , 17.25 for @xmath43 100 mev , 10.75 for 100 mev @xmath41 1 mev . </S>",
    "<S> ] for temperatures @xmath44 , when the coherent oscillations commence , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ theta ] ) can be considerably simplified , and leads to the quite simple result @xmath45 const , where @xmath46 is the axion number density . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the number of axions in a comoving volume remains in fact constant during the universe expansion . </S>",
    "<S> we further assume that no entropy production takes place after the moment when the axion field begins to oscillate . </S>",
    "<S> then the axion number density to the entropy density ratio , @xmath47 , remains constant at @xmath48 , and thus the present energy density of axions is @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the present entropy density , @xmath51 and @xmath52 k is the cmb temperature . at the initial moment @xmath53 </S>",
    "<S> , the axion number density is @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> comparing to the critical density @xmath55 gev@xmath56 , we obtain : @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 gev .    substituting ( [ f ] ) in the expression @xmath37 , which defines the temperature @xmath60 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain : @xmath61 where @xmath62 and the uncertainties of about 20 percent are related to uncertainties in parameters @xmath63 and @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> this estimation very weakly depends on @xmath65 and thus for the peccei - quinn scales of the cosmological relevance , starting from the astrophysical bound @xmath66 gev to @xmath67 order gut scale @xmath68 gev , @xmath60 changes within interval 2 gev  200 mev and hence @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> this estimation is valid , however , until @xmath70 mev . </S>",
    "<S> instead we have @xmath71 , @xmath72 and hence @xmath73 gev . </S>",
    "<S> this condition holds for @xmath74 gev . </S>",
    "<S> ] therefore , we obtain : @xmath75 demanding @xmath76 , the natural choice @xmath77 , leads to @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> one implies the _ rms _ average from a uniform distribution of initial values from @xmath79 to @xmath80 , @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in this case we obtain an upper limit on @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the pq symmetry were broken before or during inflation , then the value of @xmath16 is the same in the whole universe within the single inflationary patch , and in fact it is an arbitrary parameter selected by some random choice . ] </S>",
    "<S> it is worth underlining that the only upper limit on the pq scale comes from cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> this limit is a few order of magnitude less than the typical gut scale . </S>",
    "<S> thus , due to cosmological considerations , it seems quite improbable to insert the axion in any gut model . </S>",
    "<S> the obvious question is then : how universal is relation ( [ omegah2-st ] ) ? we will show that for a mirror axion model this can change and , </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the cosmological bound can be relaxed .    </S>",
    "<S> the idea of mirror world was introduced many years ago and has been successfully applied in different sectors of astrophysics and cosmology.@xcite the mirror world consists of another , parallel , sector of `` mirror '' particles and interactions with the lagrangian completely similar to that of the ordinary particles . in other words , it has the same gauge group and coupling constants as the ordinary world , so that the lagrangian of the whole theory is invariant with respect to the mirror parity ( m - parity ) which interchanges the two sectors .    </S>",
    "<S> the possibility to implement the pq mechanism in the mirror world scenario is discussed in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> the general feature is the following : the total lagrangian must be of the form @xmath83 , where @xmath84 represents the ordinary lagrangian , @xmath85 the mirror one and @xmath86 is an interaction term . for @xmath87 , </S>",
    "<S> the total lagrangian contains two identical @xmath88 symmetries , while the @xmath86 term breaks these in just the usual @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> thus only one axion field results , which is defined in both sectors .    </S>",
    "<S> as long as the m - parity is an exact symmetry , the particle physics is exactly the same in the two worlds , and so the strong cp problem is simultaneously solved in both sectors . in particular , the axion couples to both sectors in the same way and their non - perturbative qcd dynamics produce the same contribution to the axion effective potential . </S>",
    "<S> this situation does not bring drastic changes of the axion properties ; just the axion zero temperature mass is increased by a factor of @xmath89 with respect to the standard expression ( [ a - m ] ) . on the other hand , on a cosmological ground , </S>",
    "<S> the physics is less trivial . </S>",
    "<S> cosmologically the mirror sector can not be identical to ours . </S>",
    "<S> if so , the energy density due to the extra ( mirror ) degrees of freedom would be much bigger than what is allowed in the standard cosmology scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the mirror sector must then be colder than ours by a factor @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> extra neutrinos , in evident contradiction with the observation of the helium abundance predicted by big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) . </S>",
    "<S> the value @xmath91 corresponds to @xmath92 . for more details </S>",
    "<S> see ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> for a complete discussion on the limit on @xmath93 allowed by bbn , e.g. see ref .   and references therein . </S>",
    "<S> ] as a consequence , the energy density of the whole universe is essentially the ordinary one , and the hubble expansion is completely driven by our sector : @xmath94 , where @xmath95 counts only the ordinary degrees of freedom .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider , now , the primordial oscillations of the axion field for a generic mirror axion model . </S>",
    "<S> for this case , we have @xmath96 in the zero temperature limit . </S>",
    "<S> however , at finite temperatures the behavior of the axion mass is dominated by the contribution from the mirror sector , which has a lower temperature than the ordinary one , @xmath97 , and thus we have @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the axion mass grows faster with the temperature , and the temperature @xmath60 at which the axion field starts to oscillate scales as @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the axion mass density @xmath0 roughly scales as @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> e.g. for @xmath101 , we obtain @xmath0 about 3 times smaller than in the estimate ( [ omegah2-st ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> however , this situation is valid until the condition @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is defined as the temperature at which @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> this condition roughly translates in @xmath104 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we obtain : @xmath105 and hence : @xmath106 which , for @xmath77 , leads to the upper limit @xmath107 .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion , we have considered here a very simple model for mirror axion . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , in this , the axion properties are essentially the same as for the standard invisible axion , and only the mass is increased by a factor @xmath108 . on the other hand , we have shown that its cosmology is non trivial , because of the different temperature of the mirror sector . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a weaker cosmological bound on the pq scale . </S>",
    "<S> in particular it can be closer to the gut scale . </S>"
