    "the quest for the quantum theory of gravitation faces numerous conceptual and calculational problems , among which we can mention the different roles of time in general relativity and quantum field theory , quantum fluctuations of the background , nonlocality of gravitational observables and nonrenormalizability of the perturbative approach .",
    "nevertheless , the greatest obstacle is actually the almost complete absence of experimental or observational results that would be not explained by classical gravity and standard model and thus could guide us in the construction of quantum gravity models .",
    "it is obviously related to the fact that the expected quantum effects of gravity have an extremely small magnitude , proportional to ( the power of ) the planck length .",
    "the only solution is to look for the phenomena in which these tiny signals could be amplified enough to become measurable by means of either the currently existing or conceivable technology . in particular ,",
    "such possibilities may be considered in the semiclassical regime in which quantum gravity amounts to some corrections to the structure of classical spacetime .",
    "this is usually assumed to result in deformed dispersion relations , which modify the relativistic kinematics of particles .",
    "an example of a testable prediction in this context are time delays of photons coming from astrophysical events , e.g. gamma - ray bursts , where the sufficient amplification can be achieved due to extremely large distances to the sources .",
    "a different possibility is a modification of the threshold energy for the production of pions in the interaction of cosmic rays with the cosmic microwave background radiation , where the ultrahigh energies of the rays give us the advantage .",
    "other examples include anomalies in the production of electron - positron pairs or decay of pions , vacuum cherenkov radiation , etc .",
    "( for a recent review see @xcite ) .    deformed dispersion relations may be a consequence of deformations ( or breaking ) of relativistic symmetries as well as a nontrivial geometry of momentum space .",
    "the idea that quantum gravity should combine general relativistic spacetime with the dynamical , curved momentum space was actually suggested for the first time by m. born @xcite .",
    "later it was observed @xcite that the curvature in momentum space has to be accompanied by the noncommutativity of spacetime coordinates .",
    "this intuition was subsequently formalized in the language of quantum groups , i.e. nontrivial hopf algebras , applied to the description of deformations of relativistic symmetries .",
    "the best known case is the @xmath0-deformed poincar algebra , associated with noncommutative @xmath0-minkowski space .",
    "such mathematical structures were used @xcite in the family of models called doubly ( or deformed ) special relativity , whose objective was to represent the semiclassical regime characterized by two invariant scales that are the speed of light and the planck mass .",
    "on the other hand , in the context of more fundamental approaches to quantum gravity it was shown that , e.g. @xcite the @xmath0-poincar symmetry may arise as a semiclassical symmetry in the formalism of group field theory ( which is related to spin foam models ) .",
    "finally , doubly special relativity was recently recast @xcite as relative locality approach , whose basic principle is that spacetime becomes observer dependent and only the whole phase space is an absolute entity , which leads to the relativity of locality of events in spacetime .",
    "there is also an attempt @xcite to include relative locality in the framework of string theory .",
    "meanwhile , there exists a working physical example of the above concepts , which is given by gravity in 2 + 1 spacetime dimensions .",
    "this simpler counterpart of general relativity in 3 + 1 dimensions has a peculiar feature that momentum space of particles coupled to the ( classical ) gravitational field is the three - dimensional lorentz group and thus a curved manifold .",
    "furthermore , a result of the quantization of such particles is that spacetime becomes noncommutative .",
    "for this reason three - dimensional gravity attracts interest from the perspective of deformed relativistic symmetries , both as a toy model and a testing ground for different approaches @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was argued @xcite that symmetries of matter fields coupled to three - dimensional quantum gravity in a certain semiclassical limit are described by the @xmath0-poincar algebra .",
    "the essential purpose of this thesis was to explore some properties , consequences and mutual relations of the deformed momentum spaces associated with the @xmath0-poincar algebra on one side and particles in three - dimensional gravity or analogous objects in higher dimensions ( i.e. conical defects ) on the other .",
    "we begin chapter 1 with a general introduction to the formalism of quantum groups and present the structure of the four - dimensional @xmath0-poincar algebra .",
    "then we discuss the associated noncommutative @xmath0-minkowski spacetime and momentum space , which in @xmath1 dimensions is given by a lie group @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , we show how @xmath2 can be mapped on a ( curved ) lorentzian manifold as well as the corresponding euclidean manifold , which was obtained by us in @xcite . in chapter 2 , reporting the results from @xcite , we study in the context of @xmath0-minkowski space one of the common predictions of the quantum gravity research , which is a scale dependence of the ( spectral ) dimension of spacetime .",
    "chapter 3 is devoted to point particles coupled to classical gravity in three dimensions .",
    "we start from an overall discussion of three - dimensional gravity and describe its point particle solution in terms of geometrical variables .",
    "then we switch to the chern - simons formalism and re - derive the effective action of a single particle and a system of multiple particles @xcite . in chapter 4 , which contains the results from @xcite",
    ", we consider an alternative contraction of the de sitter gauge group in the chern - simons theory with point particles and derive a new effective particle action , which may be described as the model of @xmath0-deformed carroll particles .",
    "chapter 5 , based on our work @xcite , is concerned with conical defects in classical gravity .",
    "we discuss massive and massless defects in minkowski space and explain how their momenta can be characterized by gravitational holonomies .",
    "we particularly explore the connection between massless defects and the @xmath2 groups and we also consider massless conical defects in de sitter space . in final chapter 6 , using the material of @xcite , we discuss some partial results for the fock space arising in the quantization of particles coupled to three - dimensional gravity , which is influenced by the deformed symmetry of the theory .    everywhere below the speed of light is set as @xmath3 .",
    "a generalization of ordinary symmetry groups of physical systems are the so - called quantum groups ( for a review see @xcite ) . in order to introduce their structures",
    "let us first give a definition of the algebra in the manner that does not explicitly refer to its elements .",
    "namely , an ( unital associative ) algebra @xmath4 is a vector space @xmath5 over a field @xmath6 equipped with the following linear maps @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the multiplication @xmath9 has to satisfy the property of associativity @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the identity on @xmath5 . in the usual language it translates to @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 .",
    "the map @xmath15 , called the unit , is specified by the relation @xmath16 it means that @xmath17 and hence @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the unit element of @xmath5 . in other words",
    ", @xmath8 expresses the presence of the unit element in an algebra .    in the physical applications we are using specific representations of such abstract algebras . by a representation @xmath22 of an algebra @xmath5 we mean a vector space @xmath23 and linear map @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the space of linear operators on @xmath23 , which satisfies the homomorphism property @xmath26 if we want to describe a system composed of two subsystems ( e.g. two spinning particles ) we need to combine two representations into a representation of the tensor product of algebra elements , without violating the definition given above .",
    "it turns out that in order to construct such tensor product representations we actually need a generalization of the algebra to a new object , called the bialgebra , which has both the structure of algebra and coalgebra .",
    "a coalgebra @xmath27 is defined as the vector space equipped with the following linear maps @xmath28 and @xmath29 . the comultiplication ( or coproduct ) @xmath30 is satisfying the property of coassociativity @xmath31 for @xmath20 the coproduct can be succinctly written in the form @xmath32 , which is known as the sweedler notation .",
    "the map @xmath33 , called the counit , is specified by the relation @xmath34 thus the coalgebra can be seen as a dual structure with respect to the algebra . then @xmath35 is a bialgebra if it also satisfies the appropriate compatibility conditions , which may be described as the homomorphism properties .",
    "let us substitute bialgebra elements @xmath36 into these conditions and use the simplified notation for the multiplication and unit .",
    "then the homomorphism conditions have the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 . using the coalgebra structure we can finally construct a correct tensor product representation of the algebra @xmath5 . for a pair of representations @xmath39 , @xmath40 it",
    "is given by @xmath41 such that @xmath42 where @xmath20 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "we also observe that if we have a tensor product representation ( [ eq:11.07 ] ) of a bialgebra @xmath45 then the representation @xmath46 obtained by the flip of the tensor product @xmath47 can be expressed via @xmath48 where @xmath49 is called the opposite coproduct . in general @xmath50 and",
    "the representations on @xmath51 and @xmath52 are inequivalent .",
    "however , we can find a connection between them if @xmath45 is a quasitriangular bialgebra , which means that there exists an invertible element @xmath53 , @xmath54 such that @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "the third formula in ( [ eq:11.17 ] ) provides an isomorphism between the representations @xmath41 , @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore , it can be easily verified that @xmath59 satisfies the quantum yang - baxter equation @xmath60 this equation means the consistency of an exchange of representations in e.g. a scattering process of some particles . in this context ( a representation of )",
    "@xmath59 is known as the universal @xmath59-matrix .",
    "if @xmath59 additionally satisfies @xmath61 , where @xmath62 , then @xmath45 is called a triangular bialgebra",
    ".    a bialgebra can be further generalized to a hopf algebra if we endow it with a linear map called the antipode .",
    "the antipode @xmath63 is defined as satisfying the relation @xmath64 it can be seen as a generalized group inversion and thus a hopf algebra may be interpreted as a deformed group , where generally only certain linear combinations of elements are invertible . in the physical context",
    "there are two important types of the hopf algebras .",
    "let us first consider a lie algebra @xmath65 .",
    "it has the multiplication given by its lie bracket and the natural unit @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath65 can be turned into a ( trivial ) hopf algebra if we introduce @xmath66 where @xmath67 . strictly speaking , the maps ( [ eq:11.09 ] ) have to be extended to the universal enveloping algebra @xmath68 of the algebra @xmath65",
    "since lie algebras generally are not associative and do not have the unit element .",
    "the extension can be done in the unique way and then the full @xmath68 becomes a hopf algebra .",
    "on the other hand , a hopf algebra can also be obtained from the space @xmath69 of continuous functions on a finite group @xmath70 . in this case",
    "the multiplication is the pointwise product of functions @xmath71 and the unit @xmath18 is given by the constant function @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "we turn @xmath69 into a hopf algebra by defining @xmath74 where @xmath75 denotes the unit element of @xmath70 . for a given @xmath70 and the corresponding @xmath65 the hopf algebras @xmath69 and @xmath68",
    "can actually be shown @xcite to be ( weakly ) dual .    in order to introduce more complex structures we need to know how algebras and coalgebras act on each other .",
    "a left action of a ( bi)algebra @xmath45 on algebra @xmath5 is defined as a map @xmath76 , @xmath77 such that @xmath78 similarly one may introduce a right action @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "usually we are interested in the actions which respect the algebraic structure of @xmath5 .",
    "such a covariant action is determined by the coproduct of @xmath45 and satisfies @xmath81 the coalgebraic counterpart of the action is called the coaction .",
    "a left coaction of a bi-/coalgebra @xmath5 on algebra @xmath45 is a map @xmath82 , @xmath83 ( where we again introduced the sweedler notation and notice that @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) such that @xmath86 a coaction which respects the algebraic structure of @xmath45 has to satisfy @xmath87 where @xmath88 . a right coaction may be defined analogously .",
    "it is easy to see that the natural action of an algebra on itself is given by the multiplication and the natural coaction inside a coalgebra by the comultiplication .",
    "let us consider a pair of hopf algebras @xmath45 , @xmath5 , with a right action of @xmath45 on @xmath5 and a left coaction of @xmath5 on @xmath45 ( or a right coaction and left action ) .",
    "we can combine them into a particular type of the hopf algebra which is useful in the description of deformed relativistic symmetries .",
    "namely , a ( right - left ) bicrossproduct hopf algebra @xmath89 ( where the black triangle denotes the coaction ) is the tensor product algebra @xmath90 equipped with    [ eq:11.15 ] & ( h a ) ( g b ) = h g_(1 ) ( a g_(2 ) ) b , = * 1*_h _ a , + & ( h a ) = h_(1 ) ( h_(2))^(1 ) a_(1 ) ( h_(2))^(2 ) a_(2 ) , ( h a ) = _ h(h ) _",

    "( [ eq:11.16 ] ) ) then we can combine them into a type of the hopf algebra that is particularly useful in the context of three - dimensional gravity .",
    "namely , the quantum double of @xmath45 is a quasitriangular hopf algebra given by the tensor product @xmath92 equipped with    [ eq:11.19 ] & ( h e ) ( g f ) = h g_(2 ) f e_(2 ) , = * 1 * , + & ( h e ) = h_(1 ) e_(1)h_(2 ) e_(2 ) , ( h e ) = ( h ) ( e ) , + & s(h e ) = s^-1(e ) s(h ) ,    where @xmath93 and @xmath94 denotes the duality pairing .",
    "choosing a basis @xmath95 of @xmath45 and a dual basis @xmath96 of @xmath91 we can write the universal @xmath59-matrix of @xmath97 as @xmath98 in particular , for the hopf algebra ( [ eq:11.10 ] ) the dual is the so - called group algebra @xmath99 $ ] and the quantum double is @xmath100 $ ] .",
    "we can now explain that , briefly speaking , a quantum group ( or algebra ) is a deformation of a trivial hopf algebra of the type either ( [ eq:11.09 ] ) or ( [ eq:11.10 ] ) .",
    "in the approach using universal enveloping algebras ( [ eq:11.09 ] ) the deformation is controlled by a parameter @xmath101 , which is usually expressed as the exponential of the planck constant and thus provides a transition between the classical and quantum regimes .",
    "a simple example of such a quantized algebra is @xmath102 , which is a deformation of @xmath103 and in terms of its generators @xmath104 is given by    [ eq:11.20 ] & [ j_0,j _ ] = 2j _ , = + & ( j_0 ) = j_0 + * 1 * j_0 , ( j _ ) = j_q^j_0 + q^-j_0 j _ , + & ( j_0 ) = ( j _ ) = 0 , s(j_0 ) = -j_0 , s(j _ ) = -q^1 j _    ( where @xmath105 is understood as a series in @xmath106 ) .",

    "if we treat such exponentials as plane waves on @xmath1-dimensional @xmath0-minkowski space then @xmath2 can be interpreted as the corresponding momentum space , with the structure of the algebra of translations and related with spacetime via a noncommutative fourier transform @xcite .",
    "the product of two group elements @xmath145 , @xmath146 is given by @xmath147 where the non - abelian addition of coordinates @xmath148 is determined by the coproduct ( [ eq:12.04 ] ) .",

    "let us remark that lorentz transformations generated by such homogenous combinations of rotations and boosts as @xmath156 are called null rotations , or parabolic lorentz transformations , and their orbits in @xmath157-dimensional minkowski space are parabolae lying in the null planes .",
    "the algebra ( [ eq:13.07 ] ) may be written in the @xmath158 matrix representation @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the @xmath142-vector @xmath161 with @xmath162 at the @xmath163th position .",

    "therefore let us choose a single spacelike vector @xmath171 and define the map @xmath172 , @xmath173 from the @xmath2 group to minkowski space .",
    "then @xmath174 determines embedding coordinates @xmath175 on the @xmath2 group , which are given by @xcite @xmath176 we observe that such coordinates , as the functions of @xmath177 , satisfy two conditions @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "the first of them defines a @xmath180-hyperboloid , which is equivalent to the well - known embedding of @xmath1-dimensional de sitter space in @xmath157-dimensional minkowski space .",

    "thus half of de sitter space is the ( lorentzian ) manifold of the @xmath2 group , i.e. the @xmath1-dimensional @xmath0-minkowski momentum space .",
    "it can also be seen as elliptic de sitter space , which is de sitter space divided by the equivalence relation @xmath183 . however , since there are @xmath184 group coordinates ( [ eq:13.10 ] ) one of them is superfluous . in the classical limit @xmath127",
    "they flatten to bicrossproduct coordinates , @xmath185 , @xmath186 , with the exception of diverging @xmath187 .",
    "therefore it is @xmath188 that is the auxiliary coordinate , constrained by the hyperboloid condition .",
    "let us note that one can also map @xmath2 to the other half of de sitter space if the action of a group element @xmath170 in the map @xmath174 is given by @xmath189 instead of @xmath190 , where the matrix @xmath191 the existence of the above two maps from the @xmath2 group to the @xmath180-hyperboloid is related to the ( local ) iwasawa decomposition of the lorentz group @xmath192 , see @xcite , and the quotient @xmath193 being equivalent to @xmath1-dimensional de sitter space .",
    "one may suppose that the euclidean version of the @xmath2 manifold could be obtained in a similar manner to the above lorentzian case .",
    "indeed , following the suggestion made in @xcite , as we did in @xcite , let us now take a timelike vector @xmath194 and define the map @xmath195 , @xmath173 .",
    "it introduces a different set of embedding coordinates @xmath196 on the @xmath2 group , which are given by @xmath197 the coordinates again satisfy two conditions @xmath198 and @xmath199 .",
    "the first one defines a @xmath200-hyperboloid , which has two sheets , corresponding to the embedding of two copies of @xmath1-dimensional euclidean anti - de sitter space in @xmath157-dimensional minkowski space .",
    "the other condition restricts the coordinates to just one copy of euclidean anti - de sitter space , i.e. the sheet of the hyperboloid with @xmath201 .",
    "we observe that @xmath188 has to be the auxiliary coordinate and this is confirmed by taking the infrared limit of ( [ eq:13.12 ] ) , which gives @xmath185 , @xmath186 but @xmath187 .",
    "this also explains why we denoted @xmath202 and @xmath188 in a reverse order than in the lorentzian case .",
    "thus euclidean anti - de sitter space can be regarded as the euclidean manifold of the @xmath2 group , or the @xmath1-dimensional @xmath0-minkowski momentum space .",
    "finally , similarly as in the lorentzian case , to map @xmath2 to the other sheet of the @xmath200-hyperboloid we may use the map @xmath203 with the modified group action @xmath204 .",
    "the above two maps from the @xmath2 group to the hyperboloid correspond to another iwasawa decomposition of the lorentz group @xmath205 @xcite , while the quotient @xmath206 is equivalent to the @xmath200-hyperboloid .",
    "the lorentzian and euclidean manifolds of @xmath2 should be connected by means of an appropriate transformation similar to the wick rotation . in the previous section we mentioned the associated transformation which allows to obtain the euclidean version of the @xmath0-poincar algebra ( [ eq:12.08 ] ) , ( [ eq:12.09 ] ) . for the @xmath2 group , in bicrossproduct",
    "coordinates it corresponds to @xmath207 while in embedding coordinates the analogous transformation has the form @xmath208 applying both ( [ eq:13.13 ] ) and ( [ eq:13.14 ] ) to the expressions for lorentzian coordinates ( [ eq:13.10 ] ) we obtain their euclidean counterparts ( [ eq:13.12 ] ) .    to conclude ,",
    "let us also write down the coproducts and antipodes of the translation generators of the @xmath0-poincar algebra in the so - called classical basis , which corresponds to momentum coordinates ( [ eq:13.10 ] ) . in the lorentzian case they have the form @xcite @xmath209 where @xmath210 , while in the euclidean case we found @xcite @xmath211 where @xmath212 .",
    "thus , in contrast to the expressions in the bicrossproduct basis ( [ eq:12.04 ] ) , ( [ eq:12.05 ] ) , there is a difference between the lorentzian and euclidean case .",
    "one of the basic assumptions of the quantum gravity research is that in the ultraviolet regime of the theory spacetime itself should become quantized . trying to understand what does it mean we should take into account the following two issues .",
    "namely , whether the relativistic symmetries will be violated and the number of spacetime dimensions will change .",
    "the latter suggestion is probably more difficult to explain .",
    "however , it is closely related to the issue of the perturbative nonrenormalizability of general relativity .",
    "spacetime dimension contributes to the degree of divergence of terms of the perturbative expansion and running to the appropriate value in the ultraviolet regime it could make the expansion finite .",
    "furthermore , the dimensional flow may be a symptom of the specific small - distance structure of spacetime . to explore this scale dependence of dimension",
    "we need a different notion than the standard topological dimension .",
    "one of the more sensitive definitions is the spectral dimension , which we will introduce below .",
    "it has been extensively studied for quantum spacetimes and the flow of the spectral dimension was indeed discovered in a variety of approaches to the quantization of gravity , including causal dynamical triangulations @xcite , hoava - lifshitz gravity @xcite , asymptotic safety scenario @xcite and loop quantum gravity and spin foam models @xcite .",
    "the most typical pattern is of the dimension running from the topological dimension , i.e. 4 dimensions in the infrared limit to 2 dimensions in the ultraviolet limit .",
    "analogous results in most of the above models were also obtained in the context of three - dimensional quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "the dimensional flow is often easier to explore than the potential violations of relativistic symmetries .",
    "meanwhile , it is not difficult to observe that there is some mutual relation between both phenomena . at first sight",
    "it may even seem that a change in the number of dimensions implies the breakdown of relativistic invariance , which is the actual situation in hoava - lifshitz gravity .",
    "however , the dimensional flow may also arise when the symmetries are not broken but only deformed @xcite . on the other hand , from a given scale dependence of the spectral dimension one can in principle reconstruct the corresponding modified dispersion relation in momentum space @xcite .",
    "such dispersion relations can be either associated with a breaking or deformations of relativistic symmetries . from this perspective",
    "it is worth to calculate the spectral dimension of @xmath0-minkowski space , which was first done in @xcite and then improved by us in @xcite , as will discuss below .",
    "the spectral dimension is defined for the riemannian manifolds but can also be applied to spacetime if we use the euclideanized version of the latter .",
    "it is introduced in the following way . on a given manifold @xmath213 of @xmath214 topological dimensions and with a metric @xmath215 we consider a fictitious diffusion process that is governed by the heat equation with a laplacian @xmath28 and auxiliary time parameter @xmath216 @xmath217 where we also specified the initial condition . in general the form of @xmath28",
    "may be different from the ordinary @xmath218 , @xmath219 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath213 is flat , as in the case of minkowski space .",
    "then the solution of ( [ eq:20.01 ] ) , also known as the heat kernel , in the momentum representation is given by @xmath220 where @xmath221 denotes the momentum space version of the laplacian @xmath28 .",
    "the heat kernel can be characterized by its trace , called the ( average ) return probability @xmath222 which measures the probability of the diffusion returning to the same point on @xmath213 .",
    "the spectral dimension of the manifold @xmath213 is @xmath223 it can be described as the effective topological dimension for which the standard diffusion process in @xmath214-dimensional euclidean space ( with @xmath224 ) approximates the @xmath28-governed diffusion on @xmath213 , at a given value of the scale @xmath216 . with large @xmath216",
    "we are probing the infrared structure of @xmath213 , while small @xmath216 correspond to its ultraviolet structure .",
    "in particular , the ordinary diffusion in euclidean space is characterized by @xmath225 at all scales .",
    "let us note that such a definition of the dimension is also sensitive ( for sufficiently large @xmath216 ) to the finite size of @xmath213 and the curvature of @xmath215 and one has to subtract their potential contribution from ( [ eq:20.04 ] ) .",
    "the application of the spectral dimension in certain quantum gravity models may require @xcite modifications of the diffusion equation ( [ eq:20.01 ] ) to make the return probability @xmath226 positive semidefinite .",
    "however , in our calculations for @xmath0-minkowski space we do not encounter such a situation .",
    "we also avoid the complexities associated with the noncommutative geometry by using @xmath226 in the momentum representation ( [ eq:20.03 ] ) . on the other hand , as we shown in section 1.3 , ( the euclidean version of ) the corresponding momentum space @xmath227 is a curved manifold and this has to be accounted for .",
    "thus , as we did in @xcite , we calculate @xmath226 as the integral over embedding coordinates ( [ eq:13.12 ] ) of @xmath227 in minkowski space . in @xmath214",
    "topological dimensions we can write it as @xmath228 where the dirac delta and heaviside function constrain coordinates to euclidean anti - de sitter space . when we integrate out the auxiliary coordinate @xmath188 the return probability simplifies to @xmath229 and @xmath230 is actually the group invariant measure on @xmath227 .",
    "what we still need is the form of the laplacian @xmath231 but this remains an open issue for @xmath0-minkowski space , due to the ambiguity of the @xmath0-poincar casimir ( [ eq:12.06 ] ) .",
    "therefore we will calculate the spectral dimension for several of different laplacians proposed in the literature , in both 3 + 1 and 2 + 1 topological dimensions .",
    "a first possible choice is the laplacian determined by the bicovariant ( i.e. covariant under the @xmath0-poincar algebra ) differential calculus on @xmath0-minkowski space @xcite , which corresponds to the casimir element ( [ eq:12.07 ] ) .",
    "its euclidean version has the form @xmath232 ( this explains why @xmath233 coordinates are often called classical ) . for this laplacian",
    "the spectral dimension was already computed numerically in @xcite , where the return probability was derived with the help of the wick rotation applied to a less convenient basis of momentum generators .",
    "we use the formula ( [ eq:20.06 ] ) and in 3 + 1 topological dimensions obtain the analytical expression for the spectral dimension @xmath234 where @xmath235 denotes the complementary error function .",
    "the most significant features of @xmath236 are its values in the infrared regime , where it should coincide with the topological dimension , and in the ultraviolet regime .",
    "taking @xmath0 into account we observe that small scales of @xmath0-minkowski space are probed with the parameter @xmath216 when @xmath237 and large scales when @xmath238 .",
    "we can calculate the corresponding limits of ( [ eq:20.08 ] ) , which give @xmath239 as one can see in the plot in fig .",
    "2.1 , the dimension is indeed decreasing monotonically from the large - scale , topological dimension to the small - scale value .    [",

    "however , in 3 + 1 dimensions the small - scale value of the dimension ( [ eq:20.08 ] ) is different from the usual @xmath245 , while in 2 + 1 dimensions the ultraviolet limit of ( [ eq:20.10 ] ) agrees with the value of @xmath236 found in causal dynamical triangulations or hoava - lifshitz gravity . let us also note that the dimensional reduction may result from the small - scale fractal structure of a given space , which is the actual situation in causal dynamical triangulations .",
    "for @xmath0-minkowski space such an interpretation was already suggested in @xcite and relations between fractal and noncommutative geometries were explored in e.g. @xcite .",
    "a similar reason may be the fuzziness of points in noncommutative spacetime .",

    "we will comment on this when discussing the results for the last laplacian .",
    "let us also note that for the laplacian @xmath240 the only reasone of the spectral dimension s flow is the nontrivial integration measure in the return probability ( [ eq:20.06 ] ) , while for @xmath249 , as well as @xmath251 considered below , it is also an effect of the deformed laplacian .",
    "finally , we may take the laplacian coming from the framework of relative locality that we mentioned in the preface . in this geometric approach the laplacian on momentum space",
    "is identified as the square of the geodesic distance from the origin .",

    "such a behaviour seems to imply the breakdown of ( classical ) geometry .",

    "what remains to be explained is whether one of them is the physical laplacian .",
    "otherwise the spectral dimension would characterize a given field model on @xmath0-minkowski space rather than quantum spacetime itself .",
    "furthermore , the application of the spectral dimension to a noncommutative spacetime may be not as straightforward as it is usually assumed , which would change the reported results .",
    "let us also observe that none of the studied laplacians results in a dimensional flow that is similar to the one found in @xcite in the context of the quantum field theory of particles coupled to three - dimensional gravity . in this model going to small scales one",
    "first encounters the superdiffusion and",
    "then in the ultraviolet limit the dimension falls to zero . on the other hand , for the laplacian @xmath240 in 2 + 1 dimensions we found the same behaviour of the dimension as in some fundamental quantum gravity models .",
    "it suggests that the @xmath0-poincar algebra does not arise in the same semiclassical regime as the one considered in @xcite .",
    "incidentally , it is worth to mention that diffusion processes can also be used in the calculations of other important quantities in quantum gravity , in particular the vacuum energy density and entanglement entropy .",
    "however @xcite , they both turn out to be necessarily divergent for any form of the laplacian , while we found that the case of @xmath0-minkowski space does not change the situation .",
    "in order to try to tackle the problems associated with the quantization of gravity we may study such physical models that preserve the fundamental features of general relativity but are devoid of at least some of its complexities .",
    "one of the natural choices is to consider gravity in 2 + 1 spacetime dimensions .",
    "it can not give us a lot of insight into the dynamics of the four - dimensional quantum theory since even classical solutions in three dimensions are generally quite different than in four and do not have a good newtonian limit @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the conceptual aspects of the transition between the classical and quantum regime are essentially identical in both cases and in this context three - dimensional gravity can be really helpful ( for a review see @xcite ) , being a much simpler theory .",
    "we first observe that , in any number of spacetime dimensions , solving einstein field equations @xmath256 we can express the ricci curvature tensor @xmath257 in terms of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath258 . in more than three dimensions",
    "the riemann curvature tensor is not completely determined by the ricci tensor , since the former has more independent components , and the remaining freedom may lead to a non - flat metric @xmath259 even for vacuum @xmath260 . in the three - dimensional case",
    "this is no longer true and hence spacetime is always flat , or has the constant curvature ( with the appropriate sign ) when we turn on the cosmological constant . in other words ,",
    "gravity in 2 + 1 dimensions does not have local degrees of freedom .",
    "thus in this theory there are no local interactions and no gravitational waves .",
    "nevertheless , it turns out that three - dimensional gravity ( in the absence of matter fields ) still has some residual dynamics .",
    "the latter is given by the topological degrees of freedom , which can be introduced in several ways .",
    "firstly , one may consider nontrivial topologies of spacetime @xcite .",
    "secondly , in the case of negative cosmological constant there exist black hole solutions @xcite .",
    "finally , we may couple particles to the gravitational field .",
    "the purpose of the current chapter is to discuss the latter situation , in the context of two different formulations of three - dimensional gravity .",
    "let us note that another peculiar feature of gravity in 2 + 1 dimensions is the fact that the newton s constant @xmath70 has the dimension of inverse mass , as can be seen from ( [ eq:30.01 ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath70 provides a natural deformation scale in the space of energy - momenta and the planck mass is actually the classical quantity @xmath261 .",
    "as we will see , this leads to a nontrivial geometry of momentum space already in the classical theory .",
    "a point particle solution of three - dimensional gravity with vanishing cosmological constant was first obtained in @xcite and subsequently generalized to the case of multiple particles in @xcite .",
    "the metric of spacetime with a single static particle of mass @xmath262 in cylindrical coordinates has the form @xmath263 it describes the geometry of a cone , with the range of @xmath264 reduced by the deficit angle @xmath265 , @xmath266 ( after the transformation @xmath267 ) .",
    "apart from the cone s vertex at @xmath268 spacetime is locally isometric to minkowski space , as one can verify by a straightforward calculation of the riemann curvature .",
    "therefore the parallel transport of a vector along an arbitrary loop around the vertex depends only on the loop s winding number and a possible curvature singularity at @xmath268 .",
    "we will see below that this parallel transport is described by a rotationlike lorentz transformation ( i.e. a transformation conjugate to a rotation ) , which is naturally interpreted @xcite as a consequence of the conical singularity created by the particle at @xmath268 .",
    "let us now follow @xcite and change variables from the metric @xmath259 to the dreibein @xmath269 and spin connection @xmath270 , @xmath271 , @xmath272 , defined by @xmath273 where @xmath274 denotes the minkowski",
    "metric and @xmath275 are the christoffel symbols .",
    "since the local isometry algebra of spacetime is the ( three - dimensional ) poincar algebra @xmath269 , @xmath270 , @xmath272 may be treated as coordinates of the respective algebra elements @xmath276 and @xmath277 . outside the particle s worldline at @xmath268",
    "they have to satisfy the vacuum einstein equations , whose general solution is given by @xmath278 with a lorentz transformation @xmath279 and translation @xmath280 determining an embedding of a neighbourhood of the particle into minkowski space .",
    "due to the presence of a curvature singularity we have to introduce a cut in this neighbourhood , which may be done along the plane @xmath281 .",
    "imposing the continuity of the dreibein and spin connection across the cut , via @xmath282 , @xmath283 , we find the conditions @xmath284 where @xmath285 subscripts denote , respectively , the values of @xmath279 , @xmath280 at @xmath286 and @xmath281 , while @xmath287 is a constant lorentz transformation and @xmath288 a constant translation .",
    "briefly speaking , conical spacetime is constructed from minkowski space by removing a wedge whose edge is the particle s worldline and identifying the faces of the wedge by @xmath287 .    to obtain the proper solution one still has to remove or regularize the curvature singularity .",
    "one of the possibilities @xcite is to change the topology of spacetime by replacing the worldline at @xmath268 with a cylindrical boundary , which is enforced by the condition @xmath289 .",
    "it then follows from ( [ eq:31.03 ] ) that @xmath290 and from ( [ eq:31.04 ] ) that @xmath291 notice that in the appropriate representation ( see the next section ) any element @xmath287 of the three - dimensional lorentz group can be decomposed into a term proportional to the identity transformation and an element @xmath292 of the lorentz algebra ( which is isomorphic to the group of translations ) , i.e. @xmath293 where @xmath294 is a number constrained by @xmath292 . taking the time derivative of ( [ eq:31.05 ] ) we find that @xmath295 commutes with @xmath287 and hence it is proportional to the algebra element @xmath292 .",

    "the remaining detail of the description is the particle s mass . in conical spacetime",
    "the energy - momentum , which is equivalent to the curvature , can be measured by a parallel transport around the singularity .",
    "then the transport operator , or holonomy of the spin connection @xmath277 , is actually given by @xmath287 , as one can see from ( [ eq:31.04 ] ) . therefore @xcite it is a lorentz group element @xmath287 rather than algebra element @xmath292 that is the particle s momentum . in a frame",
    "in which the particle is at rest the holonomy @xmath287 has to be a rotation by the deficit angle @xmath265 , which means that the scalar product of a given spatial vector before and after the parallel transport should be proportional to @xmath301 .",
    "it can be shown that this leads to the mass shell condition @xmath302 for a moving particle the holonomy @xmath287 is given by the conjugation of the static holonomy with a boost .",
    "then ( [ eq:31.08 ] ) is preserved but the deficit angle becomes wider than @xmath303 , since it is determined by the particle s total energy , while the regularized worldline tilts in the direction of motion .",
    "the rotationlike holonomies span the full lorentz group , which is thus the extended momentum space of the particle .",
    "as a manifold it is equivalent to 2 + 1-dimensional anti - de sitter space .    to conclude the current section",
    "let us remark that for a particle endowed with spin @xmath304 the metric ( [ eq:31.01 ] ) generalizes to @xcite @xmath305 such a geometry of spacetime is called the spinning cone and can be constructed from minkowski space by cutting out a wedge characterized by the deficit angle @xmath303 and identifying the wedge s faces with the time offset @xmath306 .",
    "the resulting helical structure of time may lead to the problematic existence of closed timelike curves .",
    "furthermore , as we will see below , the solution ( [ eq:31.09 ] ) has a non - vanishing torsion .",
    "due to its peculiar nature gravity in 2 + 1 dimensions can also be formulated in a different way , introduced in @xcite , as a chern - simons gauge theory , which is a type of the topological field theory .",

    "however , only in 2 + 1 dimensions the number of @xmath599 generators is the same as for both the translations and the lorentz group , which allows us to obtain the algebra ( [ eq:40.12 ] ) .",
    "in section 3.1 we explained that point particle solutions of three - dimensional gravity ( with vanishing cosmological constant ) have the geometry of conical defects in flat spacetime and that the extended momentum space of a gravitating particle is a curved manifold .",
    "such topological defects of codimension 2 can be naturally generalized to higher dimensional spacetimes , where they have momenta with similar properties and therefore may be worth to study from our perspective , which gave us the motivation for @xcite .",
    "in particular , to obtain a conical defect in 3 + 1 dimensions we simply replace the pointlike curvature singularity with a singular straight line .",
    "the linear conical defects are known as cosmic strings and may actually represent real physical objects , with some finite dimensions .",
    "it was first suggested @xcite that they could form during a spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking in the early universe .",
    "consequently , they were considered as one of the possible sources of primordial density fluctuations @xcite and observations of the cosmic microwave background set the specific bounds on their contribution , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "open and closed cosmic strings can also be created in inflation models constructed in the framework of string theory @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "g. t  hooft in @xcite employed straight strings as elementary ingredients of his model of piecewise flat gravity .",
    "the exact 3 + 1-dimensional counterpart of a point particle in 2 + 1 spacetime dimensions is an infinitely long and thin , straight cosmic string .",
    "such ideal conical defects can be straightforwardly generalized to any number of dimensions if a string is replaced by a brane , i.e. a hyperplane of codimension 2 . by analogy , we will call them cosmic branes . as we know from section 3.1 ,",
    "the geometry of a conical defect is obtained by cutting out a wedge from minkowski space and identifying the wedge s faces by a lorentz transformation conjugate to the rotation by the deficit angle characterizing the defect .",
    "let us remark that this construction can be generalized @xcite to include identifications of the faces of a cut ( which not necessarily has the form of a wedge ) by a general poincar transformation , which results in different types of topological defects that one can classify as dislocations or disclinations if we apply the terminology used in the condensed matter physics .",
    "an example in 2 + 1 dimensions is given by the spinning particle ( [ eq:31.09 ] ) .",
    "however , below we will restrict to the standard defects .      generalizing the case of 2 + 1 dimensions ( [ eq:31.01 ] ) and 3 + 1 dimensions @xcite with vanishing cosmological constant ,",
    "we may write @xcite in cylindrical coordinates the metric of a single static conical defect in 4 + 1-dimensional spacetime ( or any other dimension ) @xmath601 it describes an infinite , flat cosmic brane given by the @xmath602-plane , which is the two - dimensional vertex of a defect with the deficit angle @xmath603 , @xmath604 . as we discussed in section 3.1 , in 2 + 1 dimensions",
    "the deficit angle is proportional to the product @xmath605 , which can be regarded as the dimensionless rest energy of the particle . in @xmath1 dimensions the newton s constant @xmath70 has the dimension of inverse mass times length to the power of @xmath606 .",
    "therefore , by analogy , we may introduce the dimensionless rest energy density @xmath607 , where @xmath579 is mass per unit of volume of the defect s hyperplane ( e.g. mass per the string s length for 3 + 1 dimensions ) .",
    "similarly to the three - dimensional case we find that the riemann curvature vanishes outside the defect s world - volume .",
    "thus the parallel transport of a vector along an arbitrary loop around @xmath268 is completely determined by the conical singularity .",
    "the result of the parallel transport around a given loop @xmath608 can be described by the holonomy of the levi - civita connection , which is the path - ordered exponential @xmath609 where @xmath610 are christoffel symbols for the metric ( [ eq:51.01 ] ) .",
    "notice that in four - dimensional space it is possible to take a loop around a plane since to close a path around a given hyperplane we need at least two directions orthogonal to it .",
    "let us remark that one can measure both momentum and position of a conical defect by using a generalization of the lorentz holonomy ( [ eq:51.02 ] ) to the poincar holonomy @xcite .",
    "the latter is given by the parallel transport of the whole coordinate frame instead of an individual vector , which is possible due to the flatness of conical spacetime .",
    "if the defect is not located at the frame s origin the resulting poincar holonomy is the combination of a lorentz transformation and a translation corresponding to the defect s displacement .",
    "however , since we are interested in the properties of momentum space we will restrict to the lorentz holonomies .",
    "we first calculate the holonomy ( [ eq:51.02 ] ) for the static metric ( [ eq:51.01 ] ) .",
    "this turns out to be the easiest if we take a circular loop parametrized by @xmath611 , @xmath612 and @xmath613 .",
    "then the path ordering in ( [ eq:51.02 ] ) is trivial , the coordinate basis is given by cartesian coordinates @xmath614 , @xmath615 , @xmath616 and we obtain @xmath617 ( where @xmath166 denotes @xmath618 identity matrix ) .",
    "thus , as expected , the holonomy of a massive defect is an elliptic lorentz transformation i.e. a rotation by the deficit angle @xmath619 around the origin in the @xmath620-plane , which leaves invariant the defect s world - volume .",
    "this is a transformation that identifies the faces of the wedge of a defect at rest .",
    "the metric of a moving defect can be obtained by expressing the static metric ( [ eq:51.01 ] ) in cartesian coordinates and performing a boost in a direction lying in the @xmath620-plane .",
    "obviously ( [ eq:51.01 ] ) is invariant under boosts in directions parallel to the brane . for simplicity",
    "let us consider a boost in the @xmath621 direction @xmath622 with the rapidity parameter @xmath623 .",
    "then making a transformation to lightcone coordinates @xmath624 , @xmath625 we obtain the metric @xmath626 which describes a cosmic brane travelling with the velocity @xmath627 in the @xmath621 direction .",
    "after some calculations it can be shown @xcite that the deficit angle @xmath628 of such a moving defect and the deficit angle @xmath629 of the defect at rest are connected by the relation @xmath630 and thus @xmath628 becomes wider than @xmath629 .",
    "let us observe that in the limit of small @xmath629 , @xmath628 ( [ eq:51.06 ] ) simplifies to @xmath631 which has the same form as the familiar expression for energy of an ordinary relativistic particle .",
    "namely , the defect s rest energy density is @xmath632 , while the boost factor @xmath633 and hence from ( [ eq:51.07 ] ) we find that the total energy density @xmath634 .",
    "one may note that due to the nontrivial parallel transport in spacetime with a conical defect there appears an ambiguity in the direction of a boost in different inertial frames .",
    "the problem can be resolved if the frame in which we define the boost is always chosen in a consistent way . on the other hand",
    ", one can avoid the whole issue that conical spacetime is not asymptotically minkowski space by boosting the holonomy ( [ eq:51.03 ] ) instead of the metric .",
    "namely , a boost @xmath635 acting on the rotation @xmath636 by the conjugation @xmath637 gives the lorentz group element @xmath638 the obtained holonomy is an element of the conjugation class of rotations by the angle @xmath629 , which completely characterizes the defect with the static metric ( [ eq:51.01 ] ) .",
    "conical defects that we discussed so far were timelike objects , while now we will consider @xcite lightlike ( i.e. massless ) defects .",
    "the metric of such a defect can be obtained as the theoretical limit of a moving massive defect ( [ eq:51.04 ] ) boosted to the speed of light . to this end",
    "we may follow the case of a cosmic string @xcite and use the prescription that was first introduced by aichelburg and sexl @xcite to derive the gravitational field of a photon from the schwarzschild solution and later applied to other singular sources , particularly in the study of impulsive gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "the method consists in taking the limit of the rapidity @xmath639 while the laboratory energy density of the defect @xmath640 is kept fixed . by a straightforward calculation",
    "it can be shown that @xmath641 and with the help of the distributional identity @xmath642 we find that in the aichelburg - sexl limit the metric ( [ eq:51.05 ] ) becomes @xmath643 the delta function above may seem problematic but distributional solutions of einstein equations are actually well known and understood , see @xcite .",
    "the metric ( [ eq:52.02 ] ) describes a massless cosmic brane given by the @xmath602-plane which moves along the null direction @xmath644 in the surrounding flat spacetime .",
    "therefore , similarly to massive defects , such a massless brane can be completely characterized ( up to a translation ) by the holonomy ( [ eq:51.02 ] ) of an arbitrary loop around the curvature singularity at @xmath645 . in lightcone",
    "coordinates it is convenient to choose the square loop with @xmath646 $ ] @xcite .",
    "then the path ordering is trivial and after the resulting holonomy is transformed to cartesian coordinates we eventually obtain @xmath647 it is a parabolic lorentz transformation i.e. a null rotation by the ( deficit ) angle @xmath640 in the @xmath648-plane , which has the invariant @xmath649-hyperplane .",
    "the metric of a massless defect can also be derived in an alternative way , introduced for a cosmic string @xcite , which does not lead to the ambiguities associated with performing a boost in conical spacetime . as we mentioned in the previous section ,",
    "one may directly consider a boost of the holonomy of a static defect , given by the elliptic lorentz group element ( [ eq:51.03 ] ) .",
    "if we take the aichelburg - sexl limit of the boosted holonomy ( [ eq:51.08 ] ) we find that the result is the null rotation ( [ eq:52.03 ] ) .",
    "then the idea is to reconstruct the metric which is characterized by such a holonomy , following the case of a massive defect ( [ eq:51.01 ] ) . for a massless defect",
    "the geometry has to be similar but the deficit angle should be cut out from spacetime in a null hyperplane . to this end",
    "we need the lightcone version of cylindrical coordinates , which can be obtained from usual lightcone coordinates by a transformation @xmath650 , @xmath651 .",
    "the angular - like coordinate @xmath652 has the infinite range and therefore the cut can not correspond to a simple rescaling of it , as it is the case for @xmath264 in ( [ eq:51.01 ] ) .",
    "thus we rescale @xmath652 only in the region @xmath653 , writing the metric in the form @xcite @xmath654 where the smooth function @xmath655 , @xmath656 with the compact support is used as an analogue of the scaling factor @xmath657 in ( [ eq:51.01 ] ) .",
    "it can be verified that this metric has the same holonomy as ( [ eq:52.02 ] ) and hence they are equivalent .",
    "an additional advantage of ( [ eq:52.04 ] ) is that , in comparison to ( [ eq:52.02 ] ) , it is more regular at the hypersurface @xmath658 .",
    "this also allows us to see that a massless conical defect is not accompanied by gravitational waves , as it was once regarded .    to obtain an intuitive picture of massless defects",
    "let us now consider the case of 3 + 1 dimensions and describe cosmic strings in terms of spacetime vectors",
    ". any lightlike string can be completely specified by 4 parameters @xcite .",
    "indeed , one has to choose a parabolic angle @xmath640 , which carries the defect s energy density as well as a null vector @xmath659 , which is the defect s direction of propagation and a spacelike vector @xmath660 , which is the direction of the defect s spatial extension , satisfying the orthogonality condition @xmath661 ( since a defect is invariant under boosts acting along @xmath660 ) . @xmath659 and",
    "@xmath660 can also be arbitrarily rescaled . in total",
    "it gives @xmath662 independent parameters for the possible defects , or the corresponding holonomies .",
    "thus the space of momenta , i.e. holonomies , of a massless string is bigger than the three - dimensional momentum space ( constrained by the norm ) of an ordinary null particle in 3 + 1-dimensional spacetime .",
    "the reason is that conical defects in higher dimensional spacetimes are extended objects and therefore their holonomies depend on the defect s orientation in space .",
    "the above space of holonomies can be restricted in two natural ways .",
    "firstly , we may fix the spatial orientation @xmath660 .",
    "however , then the kinematics of the defect reduces to that of a particle in 2 + 1 dimensions ( since it can only move in a plane orthogonal to @xmath660 ) .",
    "secondly , we may fix the direction of motion @xmath659 .",
    "it turns out that the latter case is more interesting . in order to discuss it in detail",
    "let us choose a complete set of orthogonal null vectors @xmath663 , @xmath664 , @xmath665 as well as a set of orthonormal spacelike vectors @xmath666 , @xmath667 , @xmath668 .",
    "assume that we fix the direction of motion of a string as @xmath669 , @xmath670 .",
    "then the string s spatial orientation is a linear combination of two vectors @xmath671 , @xmath672 .",
    "the space of its holonomies is the subgroup of the lorentz group @xmath468 formed by null rotations with the generators @xmath673 . for convenience",
    "let us replace ( in an arbitrary order ) the label @xmath674 with @xmath517 .",
    "the holonomy of a defect specified by @xmath675 , @xmath676 can be written as the group element @xmath677 ( no summation over @xmath163 ) , where the parabolic angle @xmath678 . in the case of a defect with an arbitrary @xmath660 for a given @xmath675",
    "the holonomy is naturally the product @xmath679 by a straightforward calculation we can show that the parabolic angle is given by @xmath680 , while the spacelike vector is a linear combination @xmath681 . thus both the defect s energy density and its spatial orientation are now expressed in terms of the lorentz group coordinates @xmath682 .",
    "this agrees with the counting of degrees of freedom done above since fixing @xmath659 reduces the number of free parameters to 2 .",
    "meanwhile , from section 1.3 we know that the abelian subgroup of the @xmath683 group is formed by parabolic lorentz transformations .",
    "furthermore , together with ( [ eq:13.07 ] ) we can write down @xmath142 independent representations of the @xmath684 algebra in the @xmath685 algebra , labelled by @xmath686 , @xmath687 where @xmath688 for @xmath689 and @xmath690 otherwise , i.e. @xmath691 .",
    "thus if we set @xmath241 then the space of holonomies of a massless string with a given direction of propagation @xmath675 , @xmath670 may be treated as the abelian sector of the corresponding representation ( [ eq:52.07 ] ) of the @xmath472 group . in the context of this relation",
    "we should also consider hyperbolic lorentz transformations i.e. boosts generated by @xmath692 , which are given by @xmath693 they form a one - dimensional group of boosts in the direction of the spatial component of @xmath675 , which are complementary with respect to null rotations generated by @xmath694 , @xmath695 .",
    "the action of @xmath696 on a holonomy @xmath697 has the form @xmath698 therefore @xmath696 rescales the parabolic angle @xmath699 by the factor of @xmath700 but the defect s spatial orientation is preserved .",
    "notice that , as in the case of massive defects , a boost has to act by the conjugation to keep the holonomy in the parabolic conjugation class .",
    "the discussed relation between the momentum space of a massless cosmic string and the @xmath472 group is actually stronger in the case of massless defects in 4 + 1-dimensional spacetime , whose holonomies are elements of the @xmath701 group , corresponding to 3 + 1-dimensional @xmath0-minkowski space . in general , any conical defect can be completely specified by the deficit angle and two vectors which span a plane orthogonal to its world - volume @xcite . on the other hand , by analogy with a cosmic string in 3 + 1 dimensions , we may choose to characterize a given massless defect in @xmath1 dimensions by the parabolic angle , i.e. its energy density , a null vector which determines the direction of motion and @xmath606 spacelike vectors which span the spatial hyperplane .",
    "since all these vectors are mutually orthogonal and their scaling is irrelevant we are left with @xmath702 parameters that should be carried by the defect s holonomy .",
    "if we now restrict the space of holonomies by fixing the direction of motion , as we did for cosmic strings , then the number of free parameters is reduced by @xmath703 .",
    "in particular , in the case of @xmath704 ( i.e. 4 + 1 spacetime dimensions ) a restricted defect is characterized by 4 parameters .",
    "nevertheless , in 4 + 1 dimensions there are 3 null rotations analogous to ( [ eq:52.05 ] ) and hence 3 coefficients @xmath699 .",
    "consequently , a complementary boost analogous to ( [ eq:52.08 ] ) becomes necessary in order to describe the defect and the role of the missing parameter is filled by the coefficient @xmath705 .",
    "let us also note that for @xmath706 with the fixed direction of motion the situation is the same as in the 3 + 1-dimensional case , while for @xmath707 the number of @xmath683 generators is too small to characterize such a restricted defect .",
    "to be specific , in our parametrization the holonomy of a massless cosmic brane with a given direction of motion @xmath659 can be written as @xmath708 where @xmath709 , @xmath119 and @xmath710 are five - dimensional counterparts of ( [ eq:52.05 ] ) , ( [ eq:52.08 ] ) .",
    "after some calculations we can show that the brane s energy density is @xmath711 , while its spatial plane is spanned by two orthogonal vectors which can be put in the form @xmath712 , @xmath713 , where the vectors @xmath676 , @xmath119 form an orthonormal set and the coefficients @xmath714 , @xmath715 , @xmath716 .",
    "thus the four parameters @xmath717 and @xmath640 that characterize the geometrical properties of the brane are expressed in terms of the @xmath701 group parameters @xmath718 and @xmath705 .      in this section",
    "we will briefly discuss conical defects in spacetime with positive cosmological constant and particularly the derivation of a lightlike defect . for 2 + 1-dimensional de sitter and anti",
    "- de sitter spaces massive point particle solutions were already found in @xcite , while massless ones were obtained more recently @xcite .",
    "here let us consider @xcite the case of 3 + 1-dimensional de sitter space , in which the metric of a single static defect in static de sitter coordinates is given by @xcite @xmath719 where we denote @xmath720 , and describes a cosmic string with the deficit angle @xmath721 and rest energy density @xmath722 ( although it is rather not a global solution @xcite ) .",
    "similarly to the ordinary de sitter metric we may perform a transformation of ( [ eq:53.01 ] ) to embedding cartesian coordinates in 4 + 1-dimensional minkowski space @xmath723 which satisfy the hyperboloid constraint @xmath724 .",
    "the result turns out to be identical to the metric ( [ eq:51.01 ] ) of a massive defect in 4 + 1-dimensional minkowski space but with the imposed hyperboloid condition .",
    "however , since the embedded de sitter space has one dimension less , in this case @xmath722 represents the linear energy density instead of the surface density .",
    "this equivalence of conical metrics implies that also a massless defect solution ( [ eq:52.02 ] ) from the previous section corresponds to a de sitter case .",
    "nevertheless , it may be more instructive to generalize the derivation of the metric of a massless defect in de sitter space from @xcite and see whether in the end we will obtain the same metric as ( [ eq:52.02 ] ) .    for convenience",
    "we begin by rescaling the radial coordinate in the metric ( [ eq:53.01 ] ) to @xmath725 and expanding the latter to the first order in @xmath722 , which gives @xmath726 where the pure de sitter metric @xmath727 then the idea @xcite is to transform ( [ eq:53.03 ] ) to embedding coordinates ( [ eq:53.02 ] ) and perform a boost @xmath728 , @xmath729 , obtaining @xmath730 where we denote @xmath731 and @xmath732 is now expressed in terms of embedding coordinates .",

    ", @xmath736 is the past horizon for an observer on the worldline @xmath737 , @xmath738 .",
    "] the situation seems to be qualitatively different from the case of 2 + 1 dimensions @xcite , where due to the closed geometry of de sitter space one obtains a pair of null particles at the opposite points of the horizon ( which is then a circle ) , analogously to the massive particle solution @xcite .",
    "however , from the geometric perspective this is naturally the dimensional reduction of a circle to a pair of points .",
    "perhaps the above solution is better illustrated in the different coordinates , which can be defined in analogy with the 2 + 1-dimensional case @xcite . to this end",
    "we first transform ( [ eq:53.07 ] ) using @xmath739 and perform another transformation to spherical coordinates via @xmath740 , @xmath741 , @xmath742 , obtaining the metric in the form @xmath743 the first line is actually the pure de sitter metric , while the second one describes a lightlike string at the great circle @xmath744 , @xmath745 $ ] of the cosmological horizon @xmath746 .",
    "in particular , the first term with the delta function corresponds to the string at times @xmath747 and the other at times @xmath748 .",
    "as we shown above , the form of the metric ( [ eq:53.07 ] ) is identical to the metric ( [ eq:52.02 ] ) of a massless cosmic brane in 4 + 1-dimensional minkowski space .",
    "the derivation of ( [ eq:53.07 ] ) can in principle be generalized to any number of dimensions .",
    "thus , roughly speaking , a @xmath749-dimensional massless conical defect in @xmath1-dimensional de sitter space can be seen as a geometrical projection of a @xmath142-dimensional defect in @xmath750-dimensional embedding minkowski space .",
    "this can be easily visualized .",
    "namely , the @xmath751-dimensional sphere of a defect in de sitter space is determined by the @xmath749-dimensional hyperplane of a defect in minkowski space , which is cutting through the @xmath142-dimensional sphere of a de sitter s spatial slice .",
    "we conjecture that massless defects in de sitter space can be indirectly characterized by holonomies of their embedding defects . in particular",
    ", we presume that massless strings in 3 + 1-dimensional de sitter space can be specified by holonomies belonging to the @xmath701 group but this remains to be verified .",
    "in the quantum field theory we consider states of arbitrarily many identical particles , which are built starting from the one - particle hilbert space and form the full fock space .",
    "to construct such multiparticle states , which are covariant under the underlying symmetry algebra of a given theory , we need to know how to exchange algebra representations describing individual particles . as we discussed in section 1.1 , for a system equipped with a nontrivial coalgebra",
    "this is not always possible but rather requires the existence of a quasitriangular bialgebra structure , with a universal @xmath59-matrix ( [ eq:11.17 ] ) . in particular , for the @xmath0-poincar algebra the @xmath59-matrix has been found only in the approximate form @xcite and its actual existence remains an open problem , although a lot of work on the @xmath0-deformed fock space has been done @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , for the quantized theory of particles coupled to three - dimensional gravity the associated @xmath59-matrix is known and thus we may try @xcite to construct the corresponding fock space .",
    "let us first observe that the hilbert space of an ordinary relativistic particle is given by the space of ( square - integrable ) complex functions on the particle s mass shell in momentum space , which is an orbit of the lorentz group in minkowski ( momentum ) space .",
    "this hilbert space carries an irreducible representation of the poincar group i.e. the isometry group of spacetime . as we discussed in chapter 3 , for a particle",
    "coupled to three - dimensional gravity the momentum , i.e. holonomy , becomes an element of the conjugation class of a rotation by a deficit angle @xmath265 , which is an orbit of the lorentz group acting on itself .",
    "therefore a one - particle hilbert space of the quantum field theory of gravitating ( spinless ) particles should be the space of complex functions on such a conjugation class , together with the scalar product @xmath752 where @xmath753 is the invariant measure on the conjugation class , induced by the haar measure on the full group .",
    "indeed , it can be shown @xcite that this is the case .",
    "furthermore @xcite , the above hilbert space carries an irreducible representation of the quantum double of the three - dimensional lorentz group , also known as the lorentz double ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the latter is a quasitriangular hopf algebra that can be seen as a deformation of the group algebra of the poincar group , cf .",
    "section 1.1 .",
    "thus , roughly speaking , gravity is deforming a usual group of relativistic symmetries of a particle into a quantum group .",
    "let us denote one - particle states as kets @xmath754 labelled by an element @xmath170 of a given conjugation class ( characterized by mass @xmath262 ) .",
    "then the scalar product ( [ eq:60.01 ] ) becomes @xmath755 notice that the delta function on the group enforces the identity @xmath756 , where @xmath75 is the group s unit element , and hence it gives @xmath757 .",

    "accordingly , the left and right action of lorentz transformations on a ket have the form @xmath760 the two actions are obviously related by the group inversion , i.e. @xmath761 and we could restrict to just one of them",
    ". however , for multiparticle states this choice may have a meaning , as we will see below .",
    "meanwhile , for the standard parametrization of the lorentz group the action of translations on a ket has the usual form @xmath762 with the coordinates @xmath420 , @xmath272 .",
    "the generators of translations are naturally interpreted as momentum operators , which act as @xmath763 and have the eigenvalues @xmath764 . as we already know from chapter 1",
    ", there is no unique choice of such a basis of the algebra generators .",
    "this apparently leads to the ambiguities in the properties of momenta @xcite .",
    "let us turn to the two - particle states .",
    "the total momentum of a tensor product of two kets is determined by the coproduct of the translation generators @xmath765 in the lorentz double and gives @xmath766 however , since the space of holonomies is non - abelian a two - particle state @xmath767 and its flipped counterpart @xmath768 carry different momenta @xmath769 .",
    "thus a usual ( bosonic ) symmetrized state @xmath770 is not an eigenstate of @xmath765 .",
    "if we visualize the flip of a tensor product as a straightforward exchange of the particles positions we can observe that indeed it alters the holonomy of a loop going around both particles , which describes their total momentum . therefore the correct prescription for the exchange of particles @xcite is that one particle is moved around the other and its holonomy becomes conjugated by the holonomy of the other particle .",
    "this is a ( nontrivial ) braiding of holonomies that we mentioned in section 3.3 in the classical theory and which appears naturally for topological defects coupled to gauge theories in 2 + 1 spacetime dimensions @xcite .",
    "depending on the direction of the particle exchange it leads to two types of the braided symmetrization , which correspond to a left - symmetrized state @xmath771 and a right - symmetrized state @xmath772 both states have the same , well - defined momentum @xmath773 .",
    "let us also check the result of the action of lorentz transformations on them .",
    "the coproduct of the lorentz sector of the lorentz double gives @xmath774 it follows that both left- and right - symmetrized states are lorentz covariant , to wit @xmath775 thus the braided symmetrization of a two - particle state is consistent with the underlying gauge symmetry of the theory .",
    "this is obviously a consequence of the fact that the lorentz double is equipped with the universal @xmath59-matrix , which determines a deformation of the flip operator @xmath776 , describing the particle exchange .",
    "accordingly , let us introduce @xcite the operational formula for the @xmath59-matrix associated with the left action of lorentz transformations @xmath777 similarly we may write the universal @xmath59-element for the right action , which we call the @xmath778-matrix , @xmath779 then left- and right - symmetrized two - particle states ( [ eq:60.07 ] ) , ( [ eq:60.08 ] ) are defined as @xmath780 where @xmath781 , @xmath782 are the braided flip operators .",
    "@xmath783 , @xmath784 can be straightforwardly generalized to the case of arbitrarily many particles .",
    "namely , instead of a usual exchange operator @xmath785 we have @xmath786 in contrast to @xmath787 , such exchange operators do not square to the identity and hence do not belong to a representation of the @xmath142-dimensional symmetric group ( i.e. the group of permutations ) .",
    "however , they still satisfy the properties @xmath788 which define the @xmath142-dimensional braid group . using @xmath789",
    "a left- or right - symmetrized @xmath142-particle state can be built iteratively as @xcite @xmath790 the action of lorentz transformations on a @xmath142-particle state , @xmath791 is determined via the coassociativity of the coproduct and it can be easily verified that the states ( [ eq:60.17 ] ) are lorentz covariant analogously to ( [ eq:60.10 ] ) .",
    "meanwhile , one may note that acting repeatedly with @xmath789 s on such a multiparticle state we apparently obtain new states with the same particle content .",
    "for example , the two - particle state given by @xmath792 is a momentum eigenstate with the same eigenvalue as the state ( [ eq:60.07 ] ) .",
    "however , it can also be obtained by a lorentz transformation of a state of the form ( [ eq:60.07 ] ) , to wit @xmath793 for higher powers of @xmath783 the situation is similar .",
    "it remains to be verified whether also arbitrary multiparticle states obtained in such a way as ( [ eq:60.18 ] ) correspond to lorentz transformations of the presumed generic states ( [ eq:60.17 ] ) , perhaps mixing the left- and right - symmetrization .",
    "let us note left- and right - symmetrized two - particle states are connected by lorentz transformations , i.e. they satisfy @xmath794 these relations do not straightforwardly generalize to other multiparticle states .",
    "we now define @xcite the creation operators that have the left action on kets and can be used to built the ladder of left - symmetrized multiparticle states ( [ eq:60.17 ] ) starting from the vacuum state @xmath795 .",
    "namely , we assume that @xmath796 we also introduce the corresponding annihilation operators such that @xmath797 ( where states are not symmetrized ) . in order to derive the commutation relation between creation and annihilation operators",
    "we may use the fact that an arbitrary left - symmetrized @xmath142-particle state can be written in the form @xmath798 where @xmath799 denotes an absent group element .",
    "then we find that @xmath800 on the other hand , we have @xmath801 taking the difference between ( [ eq:60.24 ] ) and ( [ eq:60.25 ] ) we obtain the commutation relation @xmath802 which is the braided counterpart of the usual relation .",
    "similarly , for the right - symmetrized states ( [ eq:60.17 ] ) we define the creation operators with the right action , to wit @xmath803 as well as the corresponding annihilation operators @xmath804 an arbitrary right - symmetrized @xmath142-particle state can be written as @xmath805 then we find that @xmath806 and @xmath807 the difference between ( [ eq:60.30 ] ) and ( [ eq:60.31 ] ) gives the braided commutation relation @xmath808 it remains to to be verified whether the relations ( [ eq:60.26 ] ) , ( [ eq:60.32 ] ) can be extended to the consistent algebras of creation and annihilation operators .",
    "our work on the spectral dimension of @xmath0-minkowski space shows that the desired dimensional reduction occurs for only one of the considered laplacians on momentum space . from this perspective",
    "the latter is probably the most interesting option for the physical laplacian .",
    "meanwhile , only in the case of 2 + 1 topological dimensions we obtain the same ultraviolet value of the dimension as in some other approaches to quantum gravity .",
    "this is another indication that the @xmath0-poincar algebra is potentially most useful in the context of quantum gravity in three dimensions .",
    "the model of @xmath0-deformed carroll particles that we derived is one more example of the @xmath0-deformed ( not necessarily @xmath0-poincar ) symmetry arising in the broad framework of three - dimensional gravity .",
    "however , we have to understand the physical meaning of the applied contraction of the chern - simons theory with the de sitter gauge group and its relation with the known results . furthermore",
    ", the properties of a multiparticle system remain to be explored . what is interesting is that we obtained a connection with the carrollian physics regime , which is currently becoming a promising area of research",
    ". thus it would be useful to study the carrollian limit in the general context of three - dimensional gravity and bf theory .",
    "our discussion of massive conical defects in higher dimensional gravity did not lead to any novel observations since such a generalization is completely straightforward . on the other hand , for massless defects we presented the correspondence between the holonomies of defects and ( the abelian sector of ) a given @xmath2 group .",
    "this relation may seem superficial but perhaps it is a symptom of the underlying nature of massless defects , which could be uncovered in their quantization or the bf theory formulation .",
    "we should also try to explore the holonomies of defects in de sitter space .    finally , our attempt at the fock space formulation of the quantum field theory coupled to three - dimensional gravity is indeed preliminary and inconclusive .",
    "nevertheless , it illustrates some possible modifications of the quantum theory arising in the presence of ( topological ) gravitational interactions , which should generalize to higher dimensions .",
    "it may also help in constructing the fock space for theories with the structure of deformed symmetries .",
