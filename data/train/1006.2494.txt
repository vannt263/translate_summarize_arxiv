    "vanadium is one of the most abundant metals on earth and it is found in about 150 different minerals .",
    "catalysts based on vanadium oxides are widely used in the production of chemicals and in the reduction of environmental pollution , in particular the vanadium pentoxide ( v@xmath0o@xmath1 ) form is extensively used.@xcite in recent years v@xmath0o@xmath1 has also been used with intercalating li ions for high - capacity solid - state batteries.@xcite the applied - research and industrial focus on catalysis and batteries involving v@xmath0o@xmath1 has led to a substantial amount of atomic - scale theory studies focusing on the v@xmath0o@xmath1 bulk@xcite and its surfaces.@xcite    the bulk of v@xmath0o@xmath1 has a stacked structure .",
    "previous atomic - scale calculations that were based on density functional theory ( dft ) with the popular semilocal generalized gradient approximations ( gga ) have often failed in arriving at the experimentally known value of the lattice parameter in the stacking direction of the layers.@xcite this is believed to happen because gga does not describe the van der waals ( vdw ) forces,@xcite and because these are expected to play an important role in binding the layers in v@xmath0o@xmath1 bulk.@xcite in several gga - based v@xmath0o@xmath1 surface or vacancy studies this deficiency of gga was either ignored or worked around by imposing the experimentally obtained lattice parameter or unit cell volume .",
    "other groups have employed the semi - empirical method dft - d ( ref .  ) for adding the vdw forces.@xcite    in this paper we use the first - principles vdw density - functional approach , vdw - df,@xcite to determine the v@xmath0o@xmath1 bulk structure .",
    "we find that the vdw forces are indeed important for binding the structure , and we analyse the binding within and mainly between the layers .",

    "the ( @xmath2-)v@xmath0o@xmath1 bulk has orthorhombic symmetry and a layered structure : each vanadium atom is connected to five oxygen atoms to create pyramids that share their corners in building a double chain .",
    "the chains are connected along the edges to form layers that are then stacked to form the bulk structure ( figure [ fig : bulk ] ) .",
    "there are three structurally different oxygen atoms in each layer .",
    "one is coordinated to one vanadium atom , the second is found in a bridging position and the third has a threefold coordinated position .",
    "the binding of the atoms inside a layer is strong whereas the interactions that keep the layers stacked are weaker , resulting in v@xmath0o@xmath1 being easily cleaved .",

    "for determining the bulk structure of v@xmath0o@xmath1 we use the first - principles nonlocal functional vdw - df within dft.@xcite we calculate the vdw - df energies in a post - gga procedure.@xcite    the main interest here is on determining the optimal inter - layer spacing in v@xmath0o@xmath1 ( which is the same as the unit cell side length @xmath6 , figure [ fig : bulk ] ) and the binding energy , defined as the energy gained by stacking layers of v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "we calculate the vdw - df total energy @xmath7 for a number of values of @xmath6 and find the minimum of the energy curve . for each point on the energy curve",
    "the procedure requires first a sc - gga calculation , from which the gga - based total energy @xmath8 and the sc - gga electron density @xmath9 are evaluated .",
    "then @xmath9 is used for evaluating the long - range correlation contribution arising from the vdw interactions , @xmath10 . following the systematic procedure described in more detail in several other publications,@xcite and summarized below , we combine the sc - gga and nonlocal results to obtain @xmath7 .",

    "the first part deals with the sc - gga calculations used as a basis for obtaining @xmath9 and some terms of the energy @xmath7 .",
    "the second part contains a short summary of the scheme used for the calculation of @xmath10 and the vdw - df total energy @xmath7 , and the third part briefly explains the effect and importance of choice of exchange functional for use in vdw - df .",

    "we describe v@xmath0o@xmath1 by an orthorhombic unit cell containing two formula units , periodically repeated in all directions .",

    "our results are converged with respect to the wave function cut off , the number of @xmath12 points needed , and a number of code - internal parameters . by lowering the number of @xmath12 points in the @xmath6 direction we notice an insignificant ( @xmath13 ev ) change in the minimum value of the sc - gga total energy curve .    since the intraplanar bonds have an ionic and partly covalent nature@xcite we assume the layers to remain rigid when changing the interlayer spacing @xmath6 .",
    "this means that the atoms are kept fixed in their positions ( found at the pbe binding distance ) relative to the layer as the distance between the layers is changed , with fixed atom - atom distances within the layers . by analysing the residual hellmann - feynman forces on the atoms , calculated from the gga - based electron density , we find that this is a reasonable approximation .    in this paper we define the binding energy @xmath14 of v@xmath0o@xmath1 to be the energy gained by moving together isolated layers of v@xmath0o@xmath1 to form the bulk structure .",
    "each unit cell in the bulk contains two formula units in one layer , periodically repeated , and the reference (  layers far apart \" ) calculation is carried out with vacuum added on both sides of the layer .",
    "the reference calculation is for a unit cell that has the @xmath6 direction side length four times that of the original unit cell , periodically repeated in all directions.@xcite we use the same reference unit cell for the nonlocal correlation ( @xmath10 ) reference calculations and this imposes additional constraints on the construction of the reference unit cell , as described further below .    to supplement our analysis of the electron density with a better description of the core electrons we carry out a set of additional gga calculations using the all - electron dft code gpaw@xcite that is based on projector augmented waves@xcite ( paw ) . in these calculations we use settings of computational parameters as close as possible to the parameters we use in dacapo .",
    "we use the vdw - df scheme to include the vdw interactions in a systematic manner .",
    "the correlation energy @xmath15 is split@xcite into a nearly - local part @xmath16 and a part that includes the most nonlocal interactions @xmath10 , @xmath17 the splitting of the correlation contributions makes it possible to employ different approximations for each term . in a homogeneous system",
    "the term @xmath18 is the correlation @xmath19 obtained from the local density approximation ( lda ) , and in general@xcite we approximate @xmath18 by @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath10 vanishes for a homogeneous system .",
    "it describes the coupling through the electrodynamic field , the dispersion interaction .",
    "the difference in @xmath10 contributions provides a description of the interaction which acts across large distances .",
    "the difference is not much influenced by local variations in the electron density .",
    "rather , it is susceptible to the more coarse - grained response of the environment .",
    "the form of @xmath10 is derived in ref .   and",
    "is @xmath20 = \\frac{1}{2}\\int\\int d\\mathbf{r}\\,d\\mathbf{r}'\\,n(\\mathbf{r})\\phi(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}')n(\\mathbf{r}')\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is a kernel , explicitly stated in ref .  .",
    "the electron density @xmath9 that enters ( [ eq:2 ] ) is taken from the sc - gga calculations and is described on a grid ( the fft grid of the sc - gga calculation ) .",
    "our code for evaluating @xmath10 is not periodic .",
    "however , as described in detail in refs .  , the natural periodicity within the bulk unit cell is easily represented by explicitly including a number of the periodic images of the unit cell , with the nearby grid points carefully described and the grid points far away only described via a coarse version of the grid .    similar to the energy contributions from the sc - gga calculations the term @xmath10 must be evaluated relative to a reference calculation with the v@xmath0o@xmath1 layers `` far apart '' . as described above ,",
    "this is here achieved with a unit cell four times the original unit cell in the @xmath6 direction , with the v@xmath0o@xmath1 layer placed close to the middle of the unit cell . for this reference calculation of @xmath10",
    "no periodicity in the @xmath6 direction is assumed .",
    "the layer must be placed such that locally , with respect to the ( fft ) grid points on which @xmath9 is described , the nuclei maintain the same positions in the bulk and the reference calculation .",
    "this means that the ( fft ) grid must be chosen such that the bulk and the reference calculations have the exact same grid point separation ; in this study we need precisely four times the number of fft points in the reference calculation compared to the original bulk calculation .",
    "the combination of correlation terms in ( [ eq:1 ] ) avoids double counting of correlation contributions .",
    "using the correlation energy @xmath15 from ( [ eq:1 ] ) the total energy in the vdw - df scheme is @xmath22 where e@xmath23 is the total energy from the sc - gga calculation and @xmath24 and @xmath25 the gga respective lda correlation calculated from the sc - gga electron density  @xmath9 .",
    "the layer binding energy @xmath14 ( per unit cell ) we define as the energy gained by moving the layers in v@xmath0o@xmath1 together accordion - like,@xcite @xmath26      with every choice of approximation for correlation functional comes a need for choosing a suitable flavor of exchange functional . in previous work",
    "we have chosen to combine the correlation @xmath15 of ( [ eq:1 ] ) with the exchange from the gga flavor revpbe.@xcite this choice has been the default for some time because calculations@xcite have shown that revpbe@xmath27@xcite does not give rise to spurious binding .",
    "this choice of revpbe@xmath27 is thus conservative in that it ensures that all the improvement in binding compared to gga calculations comes from the improvement in correlation ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "however , it has also been shown that revpbe@xmath27 is overly repulsive in the binding region of many vdw - bonded systems.@xcite in the present paper our aim is to study the binding of the layers of v@xmath0o@xmath1 by qualitatively examining the improvement in binding in the vdw - df calculations over the usual gga calculations .",
    "we do not here aim for a  perfect \" description of the binding in the sense of best possible numerical fit to experiment .",
    "rather , by showing the results of using a few choices of sound exchange flavors , we illustrate the sensitivity to those choices and find the range of values of @xmath6 and @xmath14 within which we expect the physical values to be . a forthcoming publication@xcite addresses and discusses choices of exchange flavors with vdw - df in extended ( layered ) systems . in the present presentation of v@xmath0o@xmath1",
    "binding we pick two promising candidates for exchange to use with vdw - df , besides the well known pbe@xmath27 and revpbe@xmath27 functionals .",
    "these are c09@xmath27 ( ref .  ) and pw86@xmath27 ( ref .  ) .",
    "gga exchange may be described by the enhancement over lda exchange in terms of the enhancement factor @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 with @xmath31 is the lda exchange energy density and @xmath32 with @xmath33 is the reduced electron density gradient .",

    "[ fig : fx ] the various flavors of exchange give different contributions at large values of @xmath35 and the choice of exchange flavor is therefore more important for sparse than for dense matter .    in practice",
    "we include a particular flavor of exchange functional into the vdw - df by subtracting the pbe@xmath27 energy contribution @xmath39 from the total energy @xmath40 of the sc - gga calculations ( because the sc - gga calculations are carried out with the pbe flavor of gga ) and adding the value of the relevant exchange energy , calculated from the sc - gga electron density @xmath9 .",

    "this resulted in a @xmath6 lattice constant even further away from the experimental value than the values from previous gga calculations .",
    "the deficiency in the description of the binding from gga calculations has been attributed to the presence of vdw interactions between the v@xmath0o@xmath1 layers.@xcite it is well known that gga does not adequately describe vdw interactions,@xcite thus if the layers of v@xmath0o@xmath1 are mostly bound to each other by vdw forces it is not surprising that gga calculations do not give physically reasonable results . in the following we report our results from gga calculations , from vdw - df calculations , and discuss the effect of exchange and the binding character of v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",

    "we agree that the static electron density @xmath82 may not be the best tool to interpret the binding character , as suggested and discussed in ref .  .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that qualitatively the combined interpretation from figure [ fig : chdchangeslice ] and from the bader analysis is sufficient to conclude that no short - range binding type ( like ionic or covalent bonds ) can explain the main part of the binding of the v@xmath0o@xmath1 layers .",
    "we find that inclusion of dispersive interaction is essential to complete the description of v@xmath0o@xmath1 cohesion .",
    "in this paper we have studied the role of the van der waals bonding inside a layered oxide by means of the ( by now ) well tested vdw - df method.@xcite in particular we have underlined the importance of accounting for the long range interactions that characterize this bonding in order to recover a structure of v@xmath0o@xmath1 close to that found by experiments . we have shown that the flavor of the exchange functional chosen for the vdw - df calculations can give noticeable differences in calculated binding distances and energies and the definition of the most appropriate one is still a matter of debate .",
    "specifically , in this paper we have tested two promising functionals to be used with vdw - df : c09@xmath27 and pw86@xmath27 .",
    "we have also analysed effects of numerical noise that may arise in studying sparse matter within dft .",
    "this is important because there are large regions with low density , regions that may cause errors in the evaluation of exchange .",
    "finally , we have identified how this error varies with the choice of exchange flavor .",
    "we thank m.v .",
    "ganduglia - pirovano for introducing us to the problem of describing v@xmath0o@xmath1 with dft and for constructive discussions .",
    "we also thank j.  rohrer , k.  berland , and p.  hyldgaard for valuable discussions of exchange functional issues .",
