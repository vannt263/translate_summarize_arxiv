    "in the last decades light - matter interaction has been studied in a large variety of experiments not only in many body systems such as atomic ensembles , where coherent laser pulses are transferred and stored to a collective excitation  @xcite , but also on the level of single matter particles .",
    "efficient coupling of single atoms to single photons has been demonstrated by locating an atom inside an optical cavity  @xcite .",
    "such efficient coupling is mandatory in many proposals for quantum information protocols which rely on quantum memories and processors , i.e. , on the efficient interaction of a quantum state of light with the internal quantum states of matter .",
    "light is a fast and robust way to transmit quantum information , but the transfer over long distances requires quantum repeaters based on such quantum memories  @xcite .",
    "the rate of information transfer through the quantum channel depends on the process efficiency of both storage and read - out .",
    "such efficient coupling can be achieved using a cavity based scheme and accepting the corresponding modification of the mode spectrum from continuous to discrete .    an alternative  and quite natural ",
    "approach is the coupling in _",
    "free space_. in this approach , the _ direct _ coupling of light to matter has to be maximized instead of the coupling to a cavity .",
    "besides their potential use in various applications , efficient free space coupling schemes offer large design freedom .",
    "they enable the investigation of light ",
    "matter interaction without modifying the density of states of the electromagnetic field continuum .",
    "alternatively one can study the effect of , e.g. , a modified quantum vacuum  @xcite .",
    "recently , one could witness increased efforts devoted to the topic of efficient free space coupling . when discussing the corresponding advances one can clearly distinguish between two different processes : one is the elastic scattering of a laser beam by an interacting particle for which no substantial excitation of the matter system occurs",
    ", i.e. , the probability to find the matter system in its excited state is low throughout the interaction process .",
    "the efficient elastic scattering manifests itself in the attenuation of a weak coherent laser beam resonant with a transition of the interacting particle , as has been shown for single molecules @xcite , single quantum dots @xcite , single atoms @xcite or single ions @xcite .",
    "another hallmark of efficient elastic scattering is the phase shift of a weak laser beam detuned from resonance , which was demonstrated recently for the free space scenario @xcite .",
    "corresponding theoretical contributions can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the other process treated in recent literature is the process of efficient absorption of a photon by a single atom , i.e. , the matter system is to be brought to its excited state with high probability .",
    "note that this should not be confused with a @xmath0-pulse . while a @xmath0-pulse  typically containing many photons  transfers the atom efficiently to the excited state the pulse can not be fully absorbed by a single atom .",
    "furthermore , the rotation angle of the bloch vector ( e.g. @xmath0 ) is given by time integrating the electric field envelope , while a single photon fock state has a zero electric field expectation value .",
    "theoretical and conceptual contributions devoted to the absorption of single photons can be found in refs .",
    "a recent experimental demonstration of the absorption of a single photon by a single atom was given by piro et al  @xcite , whereas an early demonstration of reduced transmission of a bright laser beam by a single ion was performed by wineland et al  @xcite .",
    "it is common to the two processes of elastic scattering and absorption of a photon that their efficiencies are proportional to the extent to which the incident light mode resembles an electric dipole wave @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the spatial properties of the incident light mode should match the ones of the wave that would emerge from the dipole moment of the interacting particle . here",
    ", we show how to experimentally generate such a dipole wave envisioning close to optimum coupling efficiencies .",
    "as outlined below , we do this by preparing a plane light wave that , after reflection off a parabolic mirror , is transformed into a dipole wave @xcite .",
    "an essential property of this setup is that the parabolic mirror covers nearly the complete solid angle surrounding the dipolar absorber .    for the specific aim of",
    "perfectly exciting a single two - level atom with a single photon one may take guidance from the spontaneous emission process : the incident photon must resemble the time reversed version of a spontaneously emitted photon @xcite .",
    "this includes the dipole properties discussed above .",
    "furthermore , time reversal arguments demand that the temporal envelope of the incident photon is exponentially increasing with a time constant equal to the lifetime of the atom s excited state @xcite . this heuristic approach has been confirmed by detailed calculations @xcite .    there",
    "exist several methods for temporal shaping of single photons in general .",
    "one approach is to shape the photon during its creation process , for instance by temporal modulation of the intensity of the control laser in schemes based on electromagnetically induced transparency  @xcite or by modulation of the pump beams driving the process of four wave mixing @xcite or parametric down - conversion ( pdc )  @xcite .",
    "also the shaping of single photons by spectrally filtering one of two pdc photons has been demonstrated  @xcite . in the case of single photon generation with a single emitter located inside an optical resonator  @xcite the temporal modulation of the pump laser intensity changes the emitted single photon waveform .",
    "furthermore a heralded single photon can also be modulated directly using electro - optic modulation  @xcite .",
    "however , with the mentioned techniques it is challenging to generate a single photon fock state with an exponentially increasing temporal envelop , especially at wavelengths in the ultraviolet spectral range ( which are of interest in this paper , see below ) .",
    "instead we use coherent laser pulses which are highly attenuated to less than one photon per pulse .",
    "this procedure is often used as a substitute for generating single photon fock states  @xcite . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we will use the term single photon also for strongly attenuated coherent states , keeping in mind that all excitation probabilities mentioned in this paper are strictly valid only for true single photon wave packets .",
    "nevertheless , if the amplitude of the coherent state is low enough , contributions from fock states with photon numbers larger than one are negligible .",
    "it is then a good approximation to apply the excitation probabilities for true single photon states to that instances of the coherent state wave packets that would be projected onto a single photon state upon measuring the photon number .    in what follows",
    ", we present and characterize experimental techniques to produce the optimal optical mode for perfectly coupling light with an atomic dipole , especially for the case of exciting a single atom with a single photon .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we motivate a measure for the coupling strength between a single atom ( or any other matter system ) and light and relate this measure to the absorption efficiency . in sec .",
    "[ generation_optimum_doughnut ] the experimental generation of a radially polarized laguerre - gauss mode is shown .",
    "we present the characterization of this beam and calculate the overlap of the experimental data with the optimal dipole wave .",
    "another property of dipole waves is their uniform phase .",
    "therefore , it is essential to compensate for phase aberrations of the device that focuses the incident light towards the matter particle .",
    "this topic is treated in sec .",
    "[ aberration_correction ] .",
    "section [ temporal_pulse_shaping ] is devoted to the shaping of the temporal properties of a weak coherent state with the aim of maximizing absorption .",
    "this aspect as well as the spatial mode shaping is exemplified for two specific linear dipole transitions of singly and doubly ionized ytterbium , but the corresponding schemes can be adapted to any dipole transition .",
    "the properties of our exemplary transitions are listed in table  [ table_transitions ] . finally , in the last section we estimate the coupling efficiencies and absorption probabilities that would be achieved when interfacing the generated light waves with the corresponding single ions .",
    ".[table_transitions ] overview of the dipole transitions treated exemplarily in this paper .",
    "lifetime data are taken from refs .",
    "the labels t1 and t2 will be used in the text for the sake of simplicity . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     with the acquired experimental data at hand we are now able to give an estimate of the coupling efficiency and absorption probability which would be achieved in experiments employing the generated field modes .",
    "table  [ estimation_overlaps ] summarizes the field overlaps of the generated light modes in time and in space domain , as well as the strehl ratio . according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : g ] ) and ( [ eq : pabs ] ) we calculate @xmath1 and @xmath2 from these values and let the strehl ratio enter as a multiplicative factor accounting for losses caused by the mirror imperfections remaining after compensation .",
    "we thus arrive at prospective coupling strengths of @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) for transition t1 ( t2 ) .",
    "these values are only about two percent below the upper limit set by the experimental geometry when using doughnut modes .",
    "the corresponding absorption probabilities are @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "these absorption probabilities are valid under the assumption of a closed two - level system ( e.g. , transition t2 of @xmath7yb@xmath8 ) . as an example for a more complex level structure we take the transition t1 of @xmath7yb@xmath9 : both the excited and the ground state are split into two zeeman sub - levels with the magnetic quantum numbers @xmath10 ( we neglect the dipole allowed @xmath11p@xmath12d@xmath13 transition due to the small branching ratio of 0.5% @xcite ) .",
    "two linear and two circular dipole transitions are possible .",
    "the probability for spontaneous decay via a linear dipole transition is @xmath14 according to the corresponding clebsch - gordan coefficient and @xmath15 via a circular dipole transition . exciting",
    "the linear dipole transition leads to a maximum possible excitation probability of @xmath14 , assuming the excitation light mode is ideal . in this sense",
    ", one has to understand the value @xmath5 given for a mode designed for this transition as a relative value , i.e. , the de facto absorption probability would be @xmath16 . however , the coupling strength @xmath1 itself is not affected by such considerations .",
    "for example , an elastic scattering experiment on any of these transitions should be feasible with the coupling strength derived for an ideal two - level system because no dipole moments are induced for transitions other than the driven one ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a calculation applying the level structure discussed above ) .",
    "we conclude this paper by emphasizing that the method presented here to generate a dipole mode can be applied to a dipole transition at any optical wavelength .",
    "an application to circular dipole transitions is straightforward requiring corresponding amplitude and polarization distributions .",
    "however , these polarization patterns become quite complex  especially when focusing from a large solid angle @xcite .    in summary , we have demonstrated the generation of modes of the electromagnetic field allowing for efficient coupling of single photons and single two - level systems in free space using a deep parabolic mirror . the free space coupling method described here",
    "should compete favorably with other coupling schemes .",
