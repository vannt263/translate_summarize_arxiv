    "the phenomenon of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) is described in statistical mechanics text - books ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "given an ideal gas of particles obeying bose statistics inside a box with sides of length @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , as the thermodynamic limit is taken in the usual way ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 while @xmath5 and @xmath6 are held fixed ) , the fraction of particles in any excited state @xmath7 , @xmath8 , goes to zero .",
    "this is expected since the single particle energy levels get closer and closer to each other , eventually forming a continuum in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the ground state is the exception . indeed , below a certain critical temperature , the fraction of particles in the ground state , @xmath9 , will be non - vanishing in the thermodynamic limit , which means that the probability distribution of particles as a function of their energy has a dirac @xmath10 component at zero energy . because of this , the chemical potential and , as a consequence thermodynamic functions in general , are non - analytical at the critical temperature , signalling the bec phase transition .    in finite systems ,",
    "however , we are away from the thermodynamic limit and , strictly speaking , a phase transition does not happen , all thermodynamic functions being smooth functions of the temperature at the critical point . nevertheless , a large finite system can be practically indistinguishable from an infinite one .",
    "for example , in the thermodynamic limit as described above , the specific heat for the three - dimensional gas has a sharp peak with a discontinuous first derivative at the onset of bec . for a finite large system",
    ", there will still be a more or less sharp peak but all thermodynamic functions will be analytical .",
    "the larger the volume that the finite system has , the sharper the peak .",
    "the difference between a finite system and its infinite counterpart can be brought out analytically in the form of finite size correction terms .",
    "furthermore , these finite size corrections are dependent on the particular way the gas is confined ; namely , they depend on the geometry of the system",
    ".    it is our aim in this article to obtain analytically finite size corrections to the thermodynamics of an ideal non - relativistic bose gas in the quantum degenerate regime in three distinct physical situations : the three - sphere ( spatial section of the einstein universe ) , the three - dimensional box which is infinite in two of the directions and finite in the other one ( we will call this the infinite slab ) and the one - dimensional box .",
    "the choice of these models enables us to perform a full analytical treatment showing very explicitly in simple expressions the finite size effects and the impact that different geometries can have in these effects .",
    "the three seemingly disparate situations under consideration have mathematical aspects in common , allowing for a unified treatment as will be seen .",
    "actually , it is well known that the one - dimensional box does not possess bec , but once we have all the mathematical apparatus set up , the study of this system requires no extra effort .",
    "the infinite slab is an example of generalized bec , in which the particles condense into a low lying set of states rather than the ground state , as described early on in @xcite ( and which the work in @xcite already hinted at ) and later systematically studied by van den berg and collaborators @xcite ( see @xcite for recent articles on this topic ) . from the systems we study here ,",
    "the only one having the usual form of bec is the three - sphere .",
    "our point of departure in the analytical treatment of the thermodynamic sums will be the mellin - barnes transform , a tool used in the past in @xcite , to study respectively the ideal bose gas in a harmonic oscillator potential , in the infinite flat space subject to a magnetic field and in the three dimensional space in which one of the directions is compactified to form a circle .",
    "this transform can also be used to obtain high temperature expansions for the ideal bose gas in quite general settings , as was shown for the bose gas under arbitrary background potentials and in boxes of arbitrary shape @xcite and , more recently , for the bose gas in product manifolds @xcite .",
    "although these high temperature expansions can provide a way of calculating a bec critical temperature in each setting , they can not be used to study the bec transition itself or the bec regime .",
    "our approach allows us to obtain large size expansions , in terms of temperature and chemical potential , which are valid and very effective throughout the quantum degenerate regime and in the vicinity of the critical region .",
    "this is done in section  [ nc ] .",
    "for the first two systems mentioned above , we will then obtain , in section  [ critical ] , an analytical description of the approach to the critical behaviour which signals the onset of bec in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "specifically , in the critical region we obtain the chemical potential , fraction of condensed particles and the specific heat as explicit functions of the temperature only . from the results",
    "thus obtained , it will be clear that the geometry of the system has a crucial role in the nature of the finite size corrections in each situation . for example , while in the three - sphere the specific heat peak happens at a slightly higher temperature than the temperature at which the chemical potential is zero , the opposite happens in the infinite slab scenario .",
    "the case of the one - dimensional box has been treated before by pathria @xcite who obtained finite size corrections to the number of particles ( as a function of temperature and chemical potential ) using the poisson summation formula . however , his procedure is valid only away from the quantum degenerate regime .",
    "finite size corrections to non - relativistic bec in the three - sphere have also been treated before by altaie @xcite .",
    "his procedure is similar to that of pathria s article mentioned above .",
    "in particular , it is based on the use of the poisson summation formula and likewise , it is valid only away from the quantum degenerate regime .",
    "a physical system analogous to our infinite slab case was considered before in the context of the thermal casimir effect in @xcite , where the authors obtain high temperature ( classical region ) expansions for the thermodynamic potential and tackle the quantum degenerate regime by setting the chemical potential identically equal to its ( thermodynamic limit ) critical value .",
    "some developments were also made in the finite size effects of a relativistic bose gas in the three - sphere @xcite .",
    "these works used a combination of analytical and numerical techniques and were very much inspired by an earlier study by singh and pathria @xcite . other work on bec for the relativistic bose gas on",

    "the energy eigenvalues in the three sphere are given by @xmath25 with degeneracy @xmath26 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath27 is the radius of the three - sphere , @xmath28 is the particle mass and @xmath29 is a coupling constant that describes the interaction of the field with the scalar curvature .",
    "we will limit ourselves to conformal coupling , @xmath30 for simplicity . as noted before @xcite ,",
    "this is not very restrictive since choosing a different coupling is equivalent to changing the mass from @xmath28 to @xmath31^{1/2}$ ] . for large @xmath27",
    ", this change is very small .",
    "in particular , in the large volume limit , all couplings will give the same results .",
    "in the non - relativistic limit , @xmath32 can be expanded in powers of @xmath33 yielding @xmath34 the constant term , @xmath28 , can be absorbed into the chemical potential in ( [ ngeneral ] ) and ( [ ugeneral ] ) , which amounts in fact to a redefinition of the chemical potential ( from @xmath35 to @xmath36 ) in all expressions , with no effects in the physics of the system .",
    "hence , we will drop @xmath28 from ( [ levelss3 ] ) .",
    "in addition , we will consider only the first term inside the parenthesis , leaving only @xmath37 .",
    "taking this limit requires @xmath38 , i.e. , little occupation of high energy states ( `` high '' when compared with @xmath28 ) , corresponding to @xmath39 . for this to be true in the temperature range we are most interested in , the critical region , it suffices having @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the particle density .",

    ", it can be shown that for small @xmath42 and small @xmath49 , the relative error in the first part of the sum is of the order @xmath42 and that the tail contribution to the error is exponentially suppressed .",

    "the first term on the right hand side is the ground state contribution ( when @xmath65 ) and it is of leading order only if @xmath66 . since the volume of the three - sphere is given by @xmath67 , we have @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the particle density .",
    "hence , when taking the thermodynamic limit , @xmath70 is a constant . since @xmath71 is a decreasing function of @xmath72 , defined only when @xmath73 , the maximum value that it can take happens when @xmath74 and it is given by @xmath75 .",
    "hence , if the particle density exceeds a certain critical value , @xmath76 , given by @xmath77 @xmath55 must go to negative values ( it must go close enough to -1 ) allowing the ground state to take the particles that can not be accommodated in the excited states and bec will happen .",
    "note that this @xmath76 is the same as the one for the standard case of an infinite cubic box @xcite .",
    "this is natural , since in the thermodynamic limit we have @xmath78 and the three - sphere will resemble more and more an infinite flat space .",
    "in fact , by writing @xmath49 in ( [ nbulk1-s3 ] ) and ( [ nbulk2-s3 ] ) in terms of volume and temperature , we see that these expressions are exactly the same as those of the infinite cubic box .    from the critical density , given as a function of the temperature in ( [ rhocrit - s3 ] )",
    ", we have the familiar critical temperature given as a function of the particle density as @xmath79 .",
    "equivalently , the critical value of @xmath49 is given by @xmath80 , as can be seen directly from ( [ nbulk1-s3 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath59 , from ( [ nbulk1-s3 ] ) we have that in the bulk , @xmath72 is a function of the rescaled temperature , @xmath81 , only ( equivalently , @xmath82 ) .",
    "more specifically , it is an increasing function of @xmath81 , as can be clearly seen from ( [ nbulk1-s3 ] ) .",
    "hence , away from the condensate region ( i.e. , @xmath83 ) , as we approach the thermodynamic limit , we have @xmath84 ( for fixed @xmath81 ) . in the condensate regime and",
    "fixed @xmath81 we will have @xmath85 in such a way that @xmath86 , so that the condensate density is not vanishing .    of course , these results are only correct in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we now obtain finite size corrections to the number of particles in ( [ nbulk1-s3 ] ) and ( [ nbulk2-s3 ] ) and to the specific heat sums , still to be introduced .    in [ sumssij ]",
    ", we define a class of sums , @xmath87 , which appear throughout the cases we study here , both in the number of particles and in the specific heat . for these sums",
    "we have obtained asymptotic expansions for small @xmath88 .",
    "these expansions are given in ( [ a : asympt1 ] ) and ( [ a : asympt2 ] ) .",
    "thus , from ( [ ns3 ] ) , ( [ a : def - s ] ) and ( [ a : asympt1 ] ) we have @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a function defined in ( [ a : def - f ] ) .",
    "the symbol @xmath91 has the usual meaning of asymptotic expansion . specifically , by truncating the infinite sum above at a certain order @xmath92 , we know that the error in @xmath20 ( or in any other of the sums @xmath87 ) will be of order @xmath93 . from the earlier discussion based on the bulk expressions ( [ nbulk1-s3 ] ) and ( [ nbulk2-s3 ] ) , we know that for large @xmath20 , the condition @xmath94 is satisfied throughout the quantum degenerate regime and also for temperatures not much higher than @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , for these temperatures , the number of particles should be well approximated by only a few terms from the sum in @xmath96 above plus the isolated term .",
    "the functions @xmath97 are studied in [ functionsfi ] , where we find their meromorphic structure and their values at particular points .",
    "we finally obtain @xmath98      -\\frac{\\pi \\sqrt{{\\epsilon}}}{2}\\coth ( \\pi \\sqrt{{\\epsilon}})x^{-1 } ,       \\label{ntrunc } \\ ] ] where we have truncated the sum at the third term and for the last term we require the value of @xmath99 from ( [ b : recur ] ) , ( [ b : f0at1 ] ) and ( [ b : f0at - k ] ) . note that this expression is valid for both positive and negative @xmath55 , although for @xmath100 the last term is more conveniently written with a regular cotangent by noting that @xmath101 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the non - relativistic ideal bose gas in the three - sphere has been treated before by altaie @xcite .",
    "in particular , using a procedure which is valid in the @xmath83 region only ( i.e. , away from the quantum degenerate regime ) , altaie obtained an approximate expression for @xmath20 which consists of the first term inside the square brackets and the term outside the square brackets in ( [ ntrunc ] ) , which amounts to truncating the asymptotic series for @xmath20 above at the @xmath102 term .",
    "hence , our result shows that this is simply the leading part of a full asymptotic expansion which is valid for both positive and negative @xmath103 ( i.e. , also in the bec regime , where in fact it is most useful ) and which can be made as accurate as one wishes ( at least , in a temperature window around @xmath95 ) by truncating at an appropriate order .",
    "when we take the thermodynamic limit we have @xmath104 and we recover the continuum approximation given by ( [ nbulk1-s3 ] ) and ( [ nbulk2-s3 ] ) , as would be expected . to see this , note that the expansion in square brackets is the small @xmath72 expansion of @xmath71 obtained by robinson in @xcite except that the term @xmath105 , present in the polylogarithm expansion , is not present here",
    ". however , when @xmath106 ( which happens for @xmath107 when @xmath3 ) the hyperbolic cotangent tends to 1 exponentially fast .",
    "hence , the last term in ( [ ntrunc ] ) will account for the missing polylogarithm expansion term and @xmath20 will be given by ( [ nbulk1-s3 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , in the bec regime we will have @xmath85 when @xmath3 and , expanding @xmath108 in powers of @xmath109 , the last term in ( [ ntrunc ] ) can be written as @xmath110 . \\ ] ] thus , to first order and when @xmath111 , @xmath20 is given by ( [ nbulk2-s3 ] ) . the -3/4 term in this expression",

    "altaie also obtained expressions for the specific heat sums , but these are only valid in the @xmath118 region as they yield an imaginary specific heat when @xmath119 .    in figure  1 , we show the fraction of particles in the ground state , @xmath9 , as a function of the rescaled temperature , @xmath81 . in figure",
    "2 we show the specific heat per particle . for both plots we used ( [ ntrunc ] ) ( with only the terms explicitly displayed ) to obtain the values of @xmath55 to input in @xmath120 ( for figure  1 ) and in the sums that appear in ( [ sh - s3 ] )",

    ", we can clearly see the approach to the familiar thermodynamic limit critical behaviour as @xmath20 is increased . in the next section ,",
    "we provide an analytical description of this phenomenon .",
    "note that contrary to what happens in the case of a bose gas in a harmonic trap , in our case the finite size effects bring the features which are characteristic of the bec transition to higher values of the temperature .",
    "this also happens in the case of a bose gas in a box @xcite or in a power - law trap with power higher than 3 @xcite .",
    "had we also plotted the exact numerical results given by ( [ ns3 ] ) , ( [ sh - s3 ] ) and ( [ a : def - s ] ) the figures would not look any different because the numerical plots would totally superimpose the analytical ones . in fact , our analytical approximation is extremely good for temperatures near @xmath95 and throughout most of the condensate region .",
    "taking as an example the @xmath122 case , the relative error in the condensate fraction , @xmath123 , is never more than @xmath124 for @xmath125 being of the order of @xmath126 at @xmath127 . for temperatures lower than @xmath128",
    "it deteriorates due to the increase in @xmath49 ( @xmath129 as @xmath130 ) , while @xmath131 .",

    "the relative error is already @xmath135 ( still quite small ) . for @xmath136",
    "the error is similar in the classical regime ( since @xmath132 is largely insensitive to @xmath20 in this regime ) but much smaller in the condensate regime ( of the order of @xmath137 or less in the critical region and in most of the condensate regime ) .",
    "the relative error in the specific heat has a similar behaviour , although it is somewhat larger ( very roughly , by a factor of about 10 in most regions ) .",
    "even higher precision is easily attained by truncating the asymptotic series at a higher order .",
    "less precision is attained if we truncate at a lower order .",
    "had we truncated the asymptotic expansion for @xmath20 at @xmath102 , we would get a relative error in the condensate fraction of order @xmath138 already for @xmath139 , independently of @xmath20 . in the condensate region",

    "<S> we study the finite size effects on bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of an ideal non - relativistic bose gas in the three - sphere ( spatial section of the einstein universe ) and in a partially finite box which is infinite in two of the spatial directions ( infinite slab ) . using the framework of grand - canonical statistics , we consider the number of particles , the condensate fraction and the specific heat . after obtaining asymptotic expansions for large system size , which are valid throughout the bec regime </S>",
    "<S> , we describe analytically how the thermodynamic limit behaviour is approached . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , in the critical region of the bec transition , we express the chemical potential and the specific heat as simple explicit functions of the temperature , highlighting the effects of finite size . </S>",
    "<S> these effects are seen to be different for the two different geometries . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider the bose gas in a one - dimensional box , a system which does not possess bec in the sense of a phase transition even in the infinite volume limit .    </S>",
