    "@xmath10 is defined to be the maximal value of @xmath6 , where @xmath4 is a legendrian knot which topologically represents @xmath9 . for any @xmath9 , by the _ bennequin s inequality _ in [ 1 ] , we know that @xmath10 is an integer ( i.e. not @xmath11 ) .",
    "there are several computations of @xmath10 ( for example , see [ 3 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] ) .    in this paper , we prove the following theorem .",
    "let @xmath12 be the connected sum of topological knots @xmath13 and @xmath14 in @xmath15",
    ". then @xmath16 .",
    "after writing this paper , the author was informed that j. etnyre and k. honda [ 4 ] have also obtained a result on connected sum of legendrian knots which extensively includes theorem 1.1 .",
    "let @xmath4 be a legendrian knot in @xmath17 . then",
    "a diagram ( i.e. projection ) of @xmath4 in @xmath18-plane is called _ front _ as in figure 1 .",
    "a front does not have vertical tangents ; generically , its only singularities are transverse double points and semicubical cusps .",
    "note that the number of the cusps is even .",
    "since @xmath19 along @xmath4 , the missing @xmath20 coordinate is the slope of the front .",
    "therefore the front of @xmath4 is free from selftangencies , and , at a double point , the branch with a greater slope is higher along the @xmath20 axis .",
    "conversely such a diagram uniquely determines @xmath4 as its front .",
    "so , as usual in knot theory , we identify a legendrian knot @xmath4 with its front , also denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "the thurston ",
    "bennequin invariant @xmath6 is computed in terms of the double points and cusps of its front .",
    "see figure 2 , where @xmath4 is oriented and the choice of the orientaion is irrelevant for the value of @xmath6 .",
    "for example , @xmath21 for the front in figure 1 .",
    "for two topological knots @xmath13 and @xmath14 , we have @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath23 and @xmath24 be legendrian knots whose topological types are @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively and @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we also regard @xmath23 and @xmath24 as fronts .",
    "further we can assume that @xmath27 and @xmath23 ( resp .",
    "@xmath24 ) lies in the left ( resp .",
    "right ) region of @xmath18-plane , i.e. @xmath28 ( resp .",
    "@xmath29 ) as in figure 3 .",
    "then we connect @xmath23 and @xmath24 by joining a right cusp of @xmath23 and a left cusp of @xmath24 as in figure 4 .",
    "this procedure produces a legendrian knot whose topological type is @xmath12 and thurston ",
    "bennequin invariant is @xmath30 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "in this section , we recall some basic notions and theorems from recent 3-dimensional contact topology .",
    "further , we may assume the reader is familiar with convex surface theory started by e. giroux in [ 6 ] .",
    "for details and proofs , see [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .",
    "let @xmath31 be the contact structure on a solid torus @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is @xmath15 modulo @xmath35 .",
    "characteristic foliation _ on an embedded surface in a contact 3-manifold is the singular foliation defined by the intersection of the contact structure and the surface .",

    "legendrian divides_. legendrian divides are leaves of the characteristic foliation on @xmath37 .",
    "the next lemma is proved by a standard darboux - type argument .    for any legendrian knot @xmath4 in @xmath5 ,",
    "there exists a sufficiently small neighborhood @xmath38 such that @xmath39 is isomorphic to @xmath40 for some @xmath41 .",
    "note that in lemma 3.1 , if @xmath4 is topologically trivial , then @xmath42 .    as @xmath37 is a _ convex surface _",
    "( i.e. has a contact vector field transverse to @xmath37 ) , the following lemma can be proved by convex surface theory .",
    "let @xmath43 be any embedded torus in @xmath5 and @xmath44 a solid torus bounded by @xmath43 .",
    "suppose the characteristic foliation on @xmath43 is diffeomorphic to that on @xmath37 and identifying these , the legendrian divides on @xmath43 are isotopic to the core curve of @xmath44 through an isotopy in @xmath44 .",
    "then @xmath45 is isomorphic to @xmath46 for some @xmath41 .    the following theorem on the classification of topologically trivial legendrian knots due to y. eliashberg  m .",
    "fraser [ 2 ] is also needed for the proof of theorem 1.1 .",
    "any topologically trivial legendrian knot is legendrian isotopic to one of standard forms expressed as fronts in figure 5 .",
    "by propositon 2.1 , it is sufficient to show the converse inequality .",
    "suppose @xmath47 is a legendrian knot in @xmath5 whose topological type is the connected sum of @xmath13 and @xmath14 and its thurston  bennequin invariant is maximal .",
    "by lemma 3.1 , there exists a neighbourhood @xmath48 of @xmath47 such that @xmath49 is isomorphc to @xmath46 for some @xmath41 .",
    "let @xmath50 and @xmath51 be 3-balls in @xmath15 such that @xmath50 ( resp .",
    "@xmath51 ) splits @xmath47 into the component corresponding to @xmath13 ( resp .",
    "@xmath14 ) and @xmath52 ( figure 6 ) .",
    "further , by convex surface theory , we can assume that ( i ) @xmath53 and @xmath54 are convex and ( ii ) @xmath55 and @xmath56 are legendrian knots on @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively and ( iii ) each _ dividing set _ on @xmath57 ( i.e. the subset of @xmath57 consisting of tangents of @xmath0 and a contact vector field defining the convex surface ) intersects @xmath58 as a diameter of the disk .",
    "then by edge - rounding lemma due to k. honda in [ 7 ] , we have a solid torus @xmath44 such that ( i ) @xmath44 equals @xmath59 except small neighbourhoods of @xmath55 and @xmath56 and ( ii ) @xmath60 is a convex surface whose characteristic foliation is diffeomorphic to that of @xmath37 . by lemma 3.2 , it follows that @xmath45 is isomophic to @xmath46 for some @xmath41 . and notice that @xmath44 is unknotted in @xmath15 and hence the core curve @xmath4 of @xmath44 which is legendrian is also unknotted .",
    "further , by a standard argument , we can assume that @xmath4 agrees with @xmath47 in the region of @xmath61 .",
    "so by theorem 3.3 , @xmath4 is legendrian isotopic to one of standard forms in figure 5 .",
    "therefore @xmath44 is also identified with a small neighbourhood of that of the standard form .",
    "further , by a homogeneous property of @xmath62 and a parallel translation of @xmath44 , we can assume that a region of @xmath44 corresponding to @xmath50 ( resp .",
    "@xmath51 ) lies in @xmath63 ( resp .",
    "@xmath64 ) .",
    "then , identifying @xmath47 with its front , we can divide @xmath47 along a vertical line into legendrian knots @xmath23 and @xmath24 corresponding to @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively as the converse procedure in the proof of proposition 2.1 ."
