    "recently , @xcite , using a sample of strong gravitational lenses , have shown that early - type galaxies lie on a mass plane ( mp ) @xmath18 where @xmath2 is the projected velocity dispersion within an aperture radius @xmath3 and @xmath19 is the surface mass density within @xmath3 , with @xmath20 , @xmath21 and rms orthogonal scatter of 1.24 when normalized by the observational errors .",
    "the fact that @xmath22 are close to @xmath23 and that the scatter is small can be expressed in terms of structural and dynamical homology of the lenses , by defining the dimensionless structure parameter @xmath24 where @xmath1 is the total projected mass within @xmath3",
    ". for their sample of lens early - type galaxies from the sloan lens acs ( slacs ) survey @xcite find on average @xmath25 which throughout the paper we will refer to as the `` observed range '' of @xmath7 .",
    "we note that the observed scatter on @xmath26 is 0.08 , but here we consider the estimated intrinsic scatter 0.057 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "as discussed in several papers @xcite the slacs lenses are found to be indistinguishable from control samples of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) galaxies with the same stellar velocity dispersion and size , in terms of luminosity / surface brightness , location on the fp , and environment .",
    "this inspires some confidence that the results found for the lens sample , including the mp , are generic properties of the overall class of early - type galaxies .",
    "independent of its origin and theoretical interpretation , the existence of the mp is a powerful empirical tool to estimate galaxy mass by using information on size and velocity dispersion only @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is clear that the very existence of the mp may be used to improve our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution . what is the origin of such a strong correlation among measurable galaxy quantities ? or , in other words , what kinds of galaxy models can be ruled out by the existence of a tight mp ?",
    "although this question has been asked before in regards to the traditional fp , the mp provides an additional powerful tool .",
    "in fact , there are a few differences between the fp ( equation  [ eqfp ] ) and the mp ( equation  [ eqmp ] ) :    1 .",
    "the fp is sensitive to the galaxy _ stellar _ mass - to - light ratio , while the mp is not .",
    "this implies that , e.g. , the role of stellar populations in establishing the tilt and scatter of the fp can be disentangled by looking at the mp . and @xmath2 .",
    "however , @xmath0 and @xmath2 do not depend on the value of the stellar mass - to - light ratio , but only on its radial variation .",
    "this variation is expected to be small based on observed colour gradients and is generally neglected in dynamical studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for simplicity ,",
    "in this study we assume uniform stellar mass - to - light ratios within each galaxy . ]",
    "the fp is traditionally based on the central velocity dispersion @xmath9 ( measured within @xmath27 ) , while the mp has been constructed using @xmath2 , which is measured within @xmath3 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fixed spatial observing aperture of the sdss spectrograph ; an mp based upon @xmath9 could be constructed using spatially resolved spectroscopy of the slacs lens sample . used to measure the aperture velocity dispersion @xmath28 , the less @xmath28 is sensitive to the orbital anisotropy .",
    "we recall that for any stationary , non - rotating , spherically symmetric system with constant mass - to - light ratio @xmath29 for @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the virial velocity dispersion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the fp combines quantities evaluated on different scales ( @xmath0 , @xmath27 ) , while mp combines quantities evaluated within the same radius @xmath3 .",
    "again , this is partially due to the fixed sdss spectroscopic aperture , though the apertures of the lensing mass measurements are fixed by the cosmic configuration of the individual strong - lens systems .",
    "each of the points above can contribute to make the mp less tilted ( and presumably with less scatter ) than the fp .",
    "for example , given the relatively large spectroscopic aperture used to define @xmath7 , we expect it to be robust with respect to changes in the detailed properties of galaxy structure , internal dynamics , and dark - matter content .",
    "similarly , by replacing surface brightness with surface mass density we expect that tilt and scatter due to diversity of chemical composition or star formation history be reduced in mp .",
    "furthermore , having all but removed the effects of stellar population the mp is potentially a cleaner diagnostic than the fp of the structural and dynamical properties of early - type galaxies .    in this paper",
    ", we exploit the existence of the mp to constrain important properties of early - type galaxies , such as orbital anisotropy and dark - matter distribution .",
    "we achieve this goal by constructing observationally and cosmologically motivated families of galaxy models and finding the range of parameter spaces consistent with the observed range of @xmath7 . for the sake of simplicity , in the present investigation we limit ourselves to spherically symmetric models . as with the fp @xcite , deviation from spherical symmetry",
    "is expected to increase the scatter of the mp because of projection effects .",

    "note that here we are not considering the average value of @xmath165 as in equation  ( [ eqobsrange ] ) , but rather are accounting for a possible dependence of @xmath7 on mass .",
    "a deviation of @xmath166 from unity is a signature of tilt , so the observational data are consistent with absence of tilt .",
    "actually @xcite found no correlation between galaxy mass / luminosity and index in their sample , consistent with the fact that the slacs sample is confined to a relatively small range of galaxy luminosities towards the bright end of the luminosity function of early - type galaxies : the mass range of bolton et al.s sample is @xmath167 .",
    "we thus compute the tilt to determine whether it is measurable and could lead to further discriminatory power if one considered a sample covering a larger mass range . for this purpose",
    ", we use our models to quantify the tilt introduced in the mp by the expected dependence of @xmath142 on mass .",
    "we consider our models with stellar distributions and we map @xmath142 into @xmath1 by combining equation  ( [ eqmlum ] ) with the best - fit correlation @xcite @xmath168 assuming @xmath169 @xcite . in order to isolate the effect of the structural non - homology of the stellar distribution , it is useful to compare models under the same assumptions on the velocity distribution . in this section",
    "we focus on models with radial anisotropy with om parameterization .",
    "we consider two families of om models with values of @xmath147 independent of @xmath142 : isotropic models ( @xmath170 ) and radially anisotropic models with @xmath171 . as for the fp ,",
    "dynamical non - homology might contribute to produce a tilt of the mp , so it is important to consider also the case in which more massive ( higher-@xmath142 ) system are more radially anisotropic than less massive ( lower-@xmath142 ) systems .",
    "this choice is motivated by the fact that higher-@xmath142 system can sustain more radial anisotropy than lower-@xmath142 systems ( see section  [ seccons ] and figs .  [ figcsis]-[figcacnfw10 ] ) and by previous studies on the fp ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , we also consider a family of models in which @xmath172 : with this parameterization @xmath173 systems are almost isotropic , while @xmath174 systems are strongly radially anisotropic . in fig .",
    "[ figtilt ] we plot @xmath175 as a function of @xmath1 ( and of @xmath142 ) for om @xmath63 models with different total mass distribution and for the three different choices of the value of @xmath147 ( isotropic in the left - hand panels , @xmath171 in the central panels and @xmath147 depending on @xmath142 in the right - hand panels ) . in each panel the dashed line and",
    "the dotted lines are , respectively , the best - fit observed relation ( equation  [ eqtilt ] with @xmath176 and @xmath177 ) , and the associated scatter in @xmath166 and @xmath140 . in fig .",
    "[ figtilt ] we report plots for the sis , ltm and acnfw+s models .",
    "we note that the acnfw+s models considered in this case have fixed value of @xmath71 ( @xmath94 or @xmath93 ) , but the value of @xmath92 is a function of @xmath142 : for given @xmath142 we obtain @xmath0 from the observed relation  ( [ eqmre ] ) and then @xmath92 from equation  ( [ eqxi ] ) , fixing @xmath74 .    from the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ figtilt ] it is apparent that the sis models behave very differently from the ltm and acnfw+s models ( nfw+s models , which are not plotted , behave similarly to acnfw models ) .",
    "let us focus first on the case with @xmath147 independent of @xmath142 ( left - hand and central panels in fig .",
    "[ figtilt ] ) . for the sis model the ratio @xmath175 gradually increases with @xmath1 , while for all other models the ratio @xmath175 increases with @xmath1 at low masses and decreases with @xmath1 at high masses ( in sharp contrast with the tilt predicted for sis models ) , and the variations with @xmath1 are stronger than in the case of the sis models .",
    "quantitatively , at high masses , the predicted slope @xmath166 of equation  ( [ eqtilt ] ) is @xmath178 for sis models and @xmath179 for the other models .",
    "when @xmath147 depends on @xmath142 ( right - hand panels in fig .",
    "[ figtilt ] ) , the dynamical non - homology introduces additional tilt , in the sense that the predicted value of @xmath166 at high masses becomes smaller , giving @xmath179 also for sis models .",
    "however , also in this case significantly less tilt is predicted for the sis models with respect to the other models .    in conclusion ,",
    "the effect of structural non - homology on the tilt of the mp is of order of a tenth of a dex in the mass ratio and thus measurable if one had a sample comparable in size and quality to slacs , covering a further decade down in galaxy masses .",
    "interestingly , the tilt of the mp is measurably different depending on whether or not the total mass profile is well represented by a sis .",
    "the tilt of the mp appears thus to be a powerful diagnostic of the internal structure of early - type galaxies .",
    "in the range @xmath5 km s@xmath6 the mp of early - type galaxies has no significant tilt and small associated scatter .",
    "this means that the dimensionless structure parameter @xmath7 defined in equation  ( [ eqcet ] ) is a nearly universal constant . in other words ,",
    "the range of values of @xmath7 `` allowed '' by the observational data is remarkably small . even for spherical galaxy models ,",
    "@xmath7 is expected to depend on the stellar density profile , orbital anisotropy of stars , and total ( dark plus luminous ) mass distribution . in this paper",
    "we explored the constraints posed by the existence of the mp on several relevant families of galaxy models .    limiting to spherically symmetric models",
    ", we found that @xmath7 is not very strongly dependent on galaxy structure and kinematics , so a relatively wide class of models have values of @xmath7 within the observed range .",
    "therefore , strictly speaking , the massive early - type galaxies lying on the mp are not necessarily structurally and dynamical homologous",
    ". however , not all the studied models behave in the same way when compared to the observational data .",
    "models in which the total density profile is a sis are consistent with the observed range of @xmath7 for a wide class of stellar density profiles , and only models with extremely radial or tangential anisotropies are excluded .",
    "the light - traces - mass hypothesis is not excluded by the observational constraints here considered , apart for the case of high-@xmath142 models , which can not be reconciled with the mp within the observed scatter .",
    "( however , ltm models are known to fail other observational constraints : see section  [ sectot ] ) .",
    "we also considered cosmologically - motivated models with nfw dark - matter halos ( with or without adiabatic compression ) , finding that they are consistent with the mp only for a relatively limited range of values of their parameters , so a degree of fine - tuning between light profile and anisotropy is required . among these nfw models ,",
    "those with adiabatically contracted halos and those that are baryon dominated seem to require slightly less fine tuning than those with non - contracted halos and those that are dark - matter dominated .",
    "this work has focused on the average value of @xmath7 in the slacs sample , along with its intrinsic scatter . with the exception of section  [ secser ]",
    ", we have not explored the implications of the fact that this intrinsic scatter is not correlated with either mass or with the ratio of einstein radius to @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "these observational results indicate a degree of structural homogeneity across a range in mass . in future works",
    ", we will explore these mass - dependent results in the context of mass - dynamical models such as those considered here .",
    "we also plan to refine these analyses based on the results of forthcoming velocity - dispersion measurements of higher signal - to - noise ratio and in smaller and more uniform spatial apertures .",
    "we also explored the possibility that the observed dependence of the index @xmath142 on the galaxy luminosity could tilt the mp when a sufficiently large mass range is considered . in this respect ,",
    "sis models behave differently from all other models : a slightly tilted mp is predicted in the early type galaxies have sis total density distribution , while a `` bent '' mp is predicted in all the other explored cases .",
    "the effect is large enough to be measurable with sample of lenses comparable to slacs in size and quality and extending a further decade in galaxy mass .    in conclusion , our results are consistent with the hypothesis that massive early - type galaxies have isothermal ( @xmath8 ) total mass density distribution , though alternative hypotheses can not be excluded on the basis of the existence of the mp alone , although in some cases they require a degree of fine tuning . in any case , the process of formation of early - type galaxies lead to systems with a combination of total mass distribution , luminosity profile , and orbital anisotropy such that they lie close to the mp",
    ". it will be interesting to quantify whether the observed fine tuning is quantitatively consistent with the range of simulated properties of early - type galaxies in the standard hierarchical model of galaxy formation .",
