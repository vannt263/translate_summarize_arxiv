    "since the mass spectra of pentaquark baryons were first studied with the mit bag model @xcite more than two decades ago , they were recently reinvestigated in the framework of chiral soliton model @xcite .",

    "one can expect that the mass of a @xmath0 in medium , @xmath1 , may also be different from its free mass .",
    "if such a change in mass occurs indeed , it can influence the production rate of @xmath0 in heavy ion collision experiments .    in this work , as a precursory step to the studies of @xmath1 in hot and/or dense matter , we consider a @xmath0 in cold matter to fix the parameters of the models . recently , @xmath1 at the nuclear saturation density and zero temperature has been calculated in two independent schemes @xcite , whose conclusions are quite different from each other . in ref .",

    "@xmath65 values are rather stable against the variation of @xmath55 and @xmath43 . in the present models ,",
    "a change in mass is caused by the non - zero value of the @xmath7-field .",
    "table [ tab : qmc - mqmc ] shows that @xmath66 at the saturation density turns out to be more or less independent of @xmath55 , which reflects the fact that the value of @xmath7-field is nearly independent of @xmath55 in both qmc and mqmc models .",
    "the effective bag radius @xmath46 in matter deviates from @xmath55 and @xmath49 also changes from that of a free bag due to non - zero value of the @xmath7-field .",

    "since these three density - dependent quantities , @xmath7-field , @xmath67 , and @xmath49 are rather independent of @xmath55 and @xmath43 , @xmath1 remains more or less the same regardless of the values of @xmath55 and @xmath43 for both qmc and mqmc models .",
    "[ fig : bagrad ] also shows that the effective radii of @xmath2 from mqmc ( qmc ) models increase ( decrease ) with density of matter .",
    "the increase of bag radii for mqmc models is of course due to the change of the bag constant in medium .",
    "the radius increases roughly by @xmath68 at the saturation density , which may be compared with the results from previous studies for nucleons @xcite .    in quark models ,",
    "the @xmath4-quark  meson coupling constants are usually set to zero , which leads to the relation between the coupling constants , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the meson - hyperon coupling constant and @xmath71 the meson - nucleon constant .",
    "however , as mentioned in the introduction , there are studies @xcite indicating that @xmath72 may have a value different from @xmath73 , which means @xmath30 or @xmath74 can be non - zero .",
    "in view of this uncertainty in the strange sector , we choose @xmath30 as @xmath75 , 0 and 2 and calculate @xmath76 for these choices .",
    "some consequences of the non - zero @xmath30 value will be discussed in the next subsection in connection with the optical potential of a kaon and its effective mass in nuclear medium .",

    "the solid , dashed and dotted lines correspond to the results with @xmath81 , 0 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the upper three thick lines represent the results from qmc , and the lower three thin lines are those from mqmc .",
    "the biggest change in the mass from the qmc model is about 12 % in the region of densities we consider .",
    "@xmath80 from the qmc model does not change much with density and @xmath9 .",
    "this weak dependence on the density and @xmath9 is due to small magnitudes of the @xmath7-field .",
    "however , this small value of @xmath7-fields can not account for the spin - orbit phenomenology in nuclei .",
    "the mqmc model @xcite increases the value of @xmath7-fields as much large as in quantum hadrodynamics @xcite . due to the large @xmath7-fields , @xmath82 from the mqmc model drops rapidly with density , and the dependence of @xmath82 on the @xmath9 value",
    "is pronounced .",
    "another reason for the mass reduction in mqmc is the following . as the @xmath7-field increases with density , the bag constant in eq .",
    "( [ eq : thetabag ] ) decreases .",
    "since the bag constant term contributes positively to the effective mass , a smaller bag constant will result in a smaller effective mass .",
    "let us consider the in - medium decay of a @xmath2 into @xmath34 channels ( @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) .",
    "since @xmath85 and its isospin partner @xmath86 interact identically with symmetric nuclear matter , we do not distinguish the two decay channels .",
    "if a @xmath2 at rest in free space decays into @xmath34 , the momenta of @xmath35 and @xmath87 are @xmath88 270 mev / c .",
    "if the masses and energies of @xmath89 and @xmath2 do not change in medium from those in free space , a @xmath2 in matter at the saturation density may decay into @xmath34 because the momentum of an outgoing @xmath87 is above the fermi momentum .",
    "however , since the properties of @xmath89 and @xmath2 may change , the chemical potentials of these particles in medium need to be considered .",
    "if the chemical potential of a @xmath2 is larger than the sum of those of @xmath35 and @xmath87 , a @xmath2 in medium can decay into @xmath34 channels . in this subsection ,",
    "we use only the mqmc model in treating both nuclear matter and @xmath2 .    in calculating the chemical potential and the effective mass of a kaon , we can treat a kaon not only as a point particle but also as a meson bag .",
    "by doing that , we may associate the optical potential of a kaon with @xmath90 , the coupling constant between a kaon and a @xmath7-meson , as we will explain shortly . among the mean field lagrangians",

    "the kaon effective mass @xmath36 includes the interaction of @xmath35 with the @xmath7-meson and is calculated in the following two methods .",
    "first , we may treat a kaon as a meson bag .",
    "then the effective mass of a kaon can be determined from the following equations : @xmath95 here we assume @xmath96 and choose the bag radius of a kaon as @xmath97 = 0.6 fm and the @xmath4-quark mass as @xmath43 = 150 mev .",

    "one obtains the following dispersion relation with the upper ( lower ) sign for kaons ( antikaons ) in uniform and symmetric matter @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the momentum of the kaon .",
    "the distortion of the kaon field in matter will smear @xmath122 around this value .",
    "we can then calculate the chemical potential of kaons as @xmath123 .",
    "the chemical potential of a nucleon and a @xmath2 can be written as @xmath124 where @xmath125 and @xmath126 are used following the quark counting rule . here",
    "we assume @xmath127 and consider only a stationary @xmath0 particle for simplicity .",
    "[ fig : chemical ] shows that @xmath117 ( the solid curve ) decreases with density at low densities due to the decrease of @xmath1 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qmc ] . at low densities both @xmath7- and @xmath8-meson fields are approximately proportional to the density , and competition between attraction and repulsion produces the nuclear saturation . at high enough densities ,",
    "@xmath7-meson fields are roughly proportional to @xmath128 , while @xmath8-meson fields are still proportional to @xmath15 .",

    ", a kaon should have momentum at least equal to @xmath64 of nucleons due to pauli blocking and momentum conservation .",
    "however , if we consider the decay of a @xmath2 through @xmath132 , a kaon can have zero momentum without violating the momentum conservation .",
    "let us denote the density at the intersection between the solid curve and the dashed ( dotted ) curve by @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) : @xmath135 and @xmath136 . at low densities",

    "<S> the in - medium mass of a @xmath0 , @xmath1 , in cold symmetric nuclear matter is calculated by using the quark - meson coupling model . </S>",

    "<S> bag parameters for a free @xmath0 are fixed to reproduce the observed mass of the @xmath0 . in doing so </S>",
    "<S> , we use three different values of the @xmath4-quark mass since the mass of the @xmath4-quark is not well known . as usual , the strengths of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 quark couplings to @xmath7- and @xmath8-meson fields are determined to fit the nuclear saturation properties . however , the coupling constant @xmath9 between the @xmath4-quark and the @xmath7-meson can not be fixed from the saturation properties , and thus we treat @xmath9 as a free parameter and investigate how @xmath1 depends on @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath1 depends significantly on the value of @xmath9 but not on the mass of the @xmath4-quark . </S>",
    "<S> chemical potentials of the @xmath2 and the @xmath10 system are calculated to discuss the decay of a @xmath2 in nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the effective mass of a kaon in nuclear matter in two ways ; using the optical potential of @xmath11 in matter and using quark model . by comparing the effective masses calculated from these two methods </S>",
    "<S> , we find the magnitude of the real part of the optical potential that is consistent with the usual quark model is about 100 mev . </S>"
