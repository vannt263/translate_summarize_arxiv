    "it is a partial differential equation which has applications in various areas of physical , biological and engineering sciences .",
    "the nls equation is a nonlinear version of the schrdinger equation , an equation that describes how quantum state of a physical system varies .",
    "the equation is named after an austrian - irish physicist erwin schrdinger ( 1887 - 1961 ) who proposed the equation in 1926 @xcite .",
    "the nls equation is also known as the cubic schrdinger equation since the nonlinearity is of order three .",
    "based on nonlinearity classification , others called it as the nls equation with kerr law nonlinearity @xcite , and the name is based on a scottish physicist john kerr ( 1824 - 1907 ) .",
    "together with the korteweg - de vries equation and the sine - gordon equation , the nls equation belongs to the classical soliton equations .",

    "in this article , we will consider , different from most of the other cited papers , the nls equation as the focusing and spatial type of equation since this it is more suitable for freak wave generation in a hydrodynamic laboratory @xcite .",
    "the nls equation that will be discussed in this article is given by @xmath3 that it is of focusing type is a consequence if the coefficients of the dispersive term and the nonlinear term have the same sign , i.e. , @xmath4 .",
    "the spatial type of equation is specified by a partial derivative in space of the evolution term , i.e. @xmath5 and the dispersive term has the second partial derivative in time .",

    ", then we have the defocusing type of nls equation .",
    "literature generally refers to the nls equation as the temporal type , given as @xmath7 .",
    "opposite to the spatial type of nls equation , this type of equation has a time derivative of the evolution term , i.e. @xmath8 and the second derivative in space of the dispersive term , i.e. , @xmath9 . ] in , @xmath10 is a complex - valued function describing the amplitude of the corresponding wave packet @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are variables related to the physical variables space @xmath14 and time @xmath15 .",

    "it is interesting to note that although there has been a continued research activity of modulational instability in many other fields since the 1960s and the 1970s down to this date , the phenomenon in bose - einstein condensates started being a topic of major interest only in the 2000s .",

    "the coefficient @xmath34 is real for sufficiently small @xmath35 , and is then the growth rate of the instability . the growth rate @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 .",
    "defining a normalized modulation frequency @xmath40 by @xmath41 , the growth rate @xmath34 becomes @xmath42 , with @xmath43 .",
    "note that for instability , the normalized modulation frequency has to be in the instability interval @xmath44 .",
    "the maximum instability occurs at @xmath45 with a maximum growth rate of @xmath46 .     as a function of the modulation frequency @xmath40 , where @xmath44",
    "the maximum growth rate is reached when @xmath45.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    from the above two equations for @xmath32 and @xmath47  , we obtain @xmath48 . taking the modulus of this ratio , we have @xmath49 . since @xmath50 , we have also @xmath51",
    ". therefore we write @xmath52 , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the phases corresponding to the lower and upper sideband frequencies , respectively .",
    "the phase relationship is given as follows : @xmath56 from the following section , we discover that the phase of the sideband frequencies is equal , @xmath57 and the phase of the plane - wave is given by @xmath58 .",
    "this implies @xmath59 the solution @xmath60 which describes the instability of the plane - wave solution now reads @xmath61.\\ ] ] we see that for @xmath62 , this solution grows exponentially in space .",
    "this is the linear instability of the benjamin - feir modulated wave signal .",
    "because of nonlinear effects from the cubic term that have been ignored in the analysis above , this growth is unbounded . in the following section",
    ", we will see that a fully nonlinear extension of the benjamin - feir instability can be found , it is bounded and is given by the sfb . for a very long modulation wavelength , namely when the modulation frequency @xmath63 , it is given by a rational solution .",
    "the type of waves on finite background in the context of this paper refers to exact solutions of the nls equation which asymptotically become the plane - wave solution for either @xmath64 or @xmath65 . since the amplitude of the plane - wave solution remains finite in space and time and forms the background for these exact solutions , these solutions are called ` waves on finite background '",
    ". however , several authors refer to this type of solutions as ` breather solutions ' @xcite . the term",
    "` breather ' was introduced by @xcite in the context of the sine - gordon equation since its solution has the characteristic property of being localised in space and oscillate ( breath ) in time .",
    "the opposite situation , oscillations in space and localised in time , is also denoted as a breather .",
    "it is interesting to note that only the focusing type of the nls equation possesses the breather solutions , while the defocusing type does not possess such type of solutions .",
    "there are a number of methods to find the exact solutions of the nls equation that are waves on finite background type solution .",
    "for instance , @xcite propose a method of finding all exact solutions using a phase - amplitude transformation , constructing a system of ordinary differential equations and implementing a certain integration procedure . a derivation using hirota s method and associating it with the dark - hole soliton solutions of the defocusing nls equation can be found in @xcite .",
    "this method is invented by ryogo hirota to find multi - soliton solutions of the kdv equation and the exponential lattice equation @xcite .",
    "remarkably , it has also provided a method for clarifying the relationship between nonlinear equations and how to find entirely new equations which also possess multi - soliton solutions .",
    "finding waves on finite background using the technique of inverse scattering transform can be found in @xcite . in the following subsection",
    ", we derive the waves on finite background type of solutions using a displaced phase - amplitude representation .",
    "one of a very recent method in finding waves on finite background solutions of the nls equation is the ` displaced phase - amplitude ' method @xcite .",
    "the authors introduced displaced phase and displaced amplitude variables , apply the variational formulation approach to explain the method and present an interesting analogy of a nonlinear oscillator equation with the corresponding potential equation that depends on the position . in the following paragraphs",
    ", we will derive the waves on finite background solutions using the displaced phase - amplitude method .",
    "we seek the type of solution of the nls equation in the form of displaced phase - amplitude variables , given as follows : @xmath66 ,    \\label{nlssolution}\\ ] ] where a real - valued function @xmath67 is referred to as the displaced amplitude and a real - valued function @xmath68 which depends only on the spatial variable is referred to as the displaced phase .",
    "since we are interested to waves on finite background type of solution , the asymptotic behavior of the solution must be a constant .",
    "this constant eventually plays the role as background for our waves .",
    "thus , with @xmath69 , it will hold that : @xmath70    substituting ( [ nlssolution ] ) into the nls equation ( [ spatialnls ] ) , we obtain two equations that correspond to the real and the imaginary parts , respectively given by : @xmath71 \\sin \\phi & = & 0 \\\\   \\partial_{\\xi}g \\sin \\phi - \\gamma r_{0}^{2 } g^{2 } ( 2\\cos^{2}\\phi + 1 ) + [ g\\phi'(\\xi ) + \\beta \\partial_{\\tau}^{2}g + \\gamma r_{0}^{2 } g ( g^{2 } + 2 ) ] \\cos \\phi & = & 0.\\ ] ] multiplying the real part by @xmath72 and the imaginary part by @xmath73 and adding both equations , will give a riccati - like equation for the displaced amplitude @xmath74 : @xmath75 solving this equation leads us to the conclusion that @xmath74 can be written in a special form . by letting @xmath76 , equation becomes a first order linear differential equation in @xmath77 : @xmath78 let us take @xmath79 as the integrating factor , multiply it to and integrate the result with respect to @xmath12 , we obtain the solution for @xmath77 : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a constant of integration that depends on @xmath13 and @xmath82 denotes the term with the integral sign . assuming that the displaced phase @xmath68 is an invertible function , we can write @xmath83 and drop the tilde signs to indicate that @xmath84 and @xmath85 . consequently , the displaced amplitude @xmath74 is now written as a function of the displaced phase @xmath86 and the temporal variable @xmath13 as follows : @xmath87 we will observe in the following subsections that by choosing three different functions of the constant of integration @xmath88 will lead to three different waves on finite background solutions of the nls equation .    on the other hand , multiplying the real part by @xmath89 and the imaginary part by @xmath72 , subtracting one from the other we obtain a nonlinear oscillator equation for the displaced amplitude @xmath74 : @xmath90 in deriving the waves on finite background type of solutions , we will compare this equation with the second order differential equation for @xmath74 after choosing a particular function of @xmath88 .",

    "in particular , for @xmath45 , called it a ` rogue wave ' solution . to honor the author who discovered this solution , called it as the ` akhmediev solution ' . in this article , we call it the sfb .",
    "the name sfb comes from the characteristics of its complex - valued amplitude plot . at a fixed time , particularly when it reaches its maxima , @xmath116 , @xmath114 , this sfb has a soliton shape but for @xmath64 , it goes to a finite background of the plane - wave solution @xmath117 . at a fixed position ,",
    "the sfb is periodic in time and its periodicity depends on the modulation frequency @xmath35 , which is given by @xmath118 .",

    "a suitably chosen velocity is used to show it in a moving frame of reference .",
    "it is interesting to note that the wave field shows ` wavefront dislocation ' where waves are merging and splitting as they travel along the @xmath14-axis .",
    "although sfb is defined for @xmath44 , wavefront dislocation only occurs for @xmath123 .",
    "this means that there is no wavefront dislocation for modulation frequency @xmath124 .",

    "these ones correspond to the sfb for @xmath45 and to the ma solution for @xmath208 . in @xcite , the sfb for @xmath45",
    "is referred as the ` rogue wave solution ' of the spatial nls equation and the ma solution for @xmath208 is called ` another rogue wave spectral component ' .",
    "in particular , an implementation of the sfb wave signal as one type of waves on finite background for freak wave generation in hydrodynamic laboratories including some experimental results is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the experiment on freak wave generation using the sfb as our theoretical model for wave signal propagation has been conducted at the high - speed basin of the maritime research insitute netherlands ( marin ) .",
    "we choose the sfb instead of the ma solution since the initial sfb wave signal is more reasonable to generate by the wavemaker than the initial ma wave signal .",

    "considering the condition of the wave basin , we conclude that it is rather impossible to generate the ma wave signal and therefore we decided to do experiments using the sfb wave signal .    after collecting experimental data and perform some analysis , we observe that all experimental results show amplitude increase according to the benjamin - feir modulational instability phenomenon corresponding to the sfb solution of the nls equation . the carrier wave frequency and the modulation period",
    "are conserved during the wave propagation in the wave basin .",
    "a significant difference is that the experimental wave signal does not preserve the symmetry structure as possessed by the sfb wave signal .",
    "nevertheless , the experimental signal shows a closely related phenomenon to wavefront dislocation , namely phase singularity . in one modulation period , the sfb wave signal has one pair of phase singularities but the experimental signal has only one singularity in this same time interval .    in the following section",

    "now we consider a different set of parameters , i.e. @xmath240 , @xmath310 and @xmath311 .",
    "we observe that this set of parameters gives a different pattern for sfb@xmath1 , as compared to the two previous cases .",
    "figure [ 3d3 ] shows for a three - dimensional plot of the absolute value of the complex - valued amplitude and a density plot of the corresponding physical wave field for the sfb@xmath1 with this choice of parameters .",
    "the interaction results to sfb@xmath1 with single and double extreme parts arranged alternatingly in the temporal direction . the modulation period between each extreme part ,",
    "whether it is single or double , is @xmath291 .",
    "the double extreme part has larger maximum values than the single part .",
    "while the single part reaches its maxima at @xmath110 , the double extreme part reaches its maxima at two different positions , @xmath312 and @xmath313 , symmetric with respect to @xmath110 , see figure [ 3d3](a ) .",
    "the corresponding physical field also shows wavefront dislocation which is periodic in time .",
    "now it occurs at three different positions , @xmath304 , @xmath126 and @xmath305 .",
    "see figure [ 3d3](b ) .",
    "each time we follow a wave crest or a wave trough along its propagation , splitting waves will be followed by merging waves , and vice versa . by observing the propagation of the corresponding wave signal",
    ", we observe that phase singularity occurs at three different positions too .",
    "figure [ signalsfb2nu12xi0 ] shows plots of the sfb@xmath1 wave signal evolution with this choice of parameters . in this example phase singularity",
    "occurs at @xmath314 , @xmath126 and @xmath315 .",
    "notice that the wave signals at @xmath316 have a similar pattern since the whole profile is symmetric with respect to @xmath126 .",
    "note also that there is always one pair of phase singularities within one modulation period .",
    "we observe that a modulated wave signal develops into an extreme wave signal at @xmath314 , but after slightly decaying , it rises again to another extreme wave signal at @xmath126 , which has smaller maximum value than the one at @xmath316 .",
    "this wave signal also decays a little bit , but not until becoming the plane - wave solution , then it rises again to reach a similar extreme wave signal as previously at @xmath315 .",
    "after this position , the wave signal returns to its initial condition and eventually becomes the plane - wave solution at the far field .",
    "regarding applications , the sfb@xmath1 family of solutions of the nls equation can be implemented for freak wave generation in hydrodynamic laboratory , as is the case for sfb@xmath0 .",
    "in this article , we have discussed several characteristics of waves on finite background type of solutions of the nls equation .",
    "these exact solutions are derived using displaced phase - amplitude variables .",
    "although the exact solutions themselves are complex - valued functions , both the displaced phase and the displaced amplitude are real - valued functions .",
    "it is interesting to note that the displaced amplitude satisfies a riccati - like equation as well as a nonlinear oscillator equation .",
    "the corresponding potential equation of this nonlinear oscillator equation depends on the displaced phase and a quartic function of the displaced amplitude .",
    "the total energy for the displaced phase - amplitude representation is zero for all waves on finite background type of solutions discussed in this article .",
    "the waves on finite background type of solutions that we derived are known as the sfb , the ma solution and the rational solution .",
    "the sfb is periodic in time but at @xmath317 has a soliton - like profile which goes to a finite background for @xmath64 .",
    "the ma solution is periodic in space and at @xmath318 has a soliton - like form for @xmath65 .",
    "the rational solution is on the other hand neither space - periodic nor time - periodic .",
    "instead , it is isolated around @xmath196 .",
    "the rational solution can be obtained by taking the modulation frequency @xmath63 in the sfb or the parameter @xmath173 in the ma solution .",
    "all these three exact solutions have been proposed as mathematical models for freak wave events both in the open oceans as well as in the hydrodynamic laboratories .",
    "in particular , we have chosen a family of sfb solution , or sfb@xmath0 in the context of higher order waves on finite background , as a good candidate for generating freak wave events in the wave basin of a hydrodynamic laboratory .",
    "this is due to the fact that the sfb has an initial modulated wave signal which is much easier to be generated by the wavemaker compared to the ma wave signal , which even could have a rather high amplitude at or close to the wavemaker .",
    "compared to the rational solution wave signal that has infinite modulation period , the sfb wave signal has a finite modulation period . besides",
    ", experiments on the rational wave solution have been discussed by .",
    "although there are some limitations on the theoretical model based on the sfb , several important robust phenomena are still observed in the experimental results , amongst others are an amplitude increase based on the benjamin - feir modulational instability , phase singularity and the preservation of the carrier wave frequency as well as the modulation period .    in order to get the best possible match between the theoretical model and the experimental result , improving the model for the wave propagation might become a necessary step for a particular research direction .",
    "a number of experts in the theory of water waves have suggested implementing the modified nls equation that contains higher order terms @xcite .",
    "another effort to improve the model equation has been done by one of us ( evg ) which leads to nonlinear dispersive higher order kdv - type of equations for waves above finite or infinite depth @xcite .",
    "there are no tangible experimental results for the freak wave generation using sfb@xmath1 family of solutions yet .",
    "nonetheless , we are convinced that several aspects of our theoretical model will support the experimental finding for a particular case of sfb@xmath1 freak wave generation .",
    "we remark that experiments on freak wave generation using sfb@xmath1 is interesting for future research .",
    "since we only consider unidirectional waves on finite background type of solutions , an extension to bidirectional or multidirectional waves on finite background type of solutions for freak wave generation is another interesting possible future research direction .",
