    "this paper is devoted to nonlinear schrdinger equations ( nls ) of the form @xmath1 here , @xmath2 is a complex valued function , @xmath3 is a possibly rough / discontinuous potential and @xmath4 is a smooth function ( in terms of the density @xmath5 ) that describes the nonlinearity .",
    "a common example is the cubic nonlinearity given by @xmath6 , for @xmath7 , for which the equation is known as the gross - pitaevskii equation modeling for instance the dynamics of bose - einstein condensates in a potential trap @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study galerkin approximations of the nls using a finite element space discretization to account for missing regularity due to a possibly discontinuous potential and we use a crank - nicolson time discretization to conserve two important invariants of the nls , namely the mass and the energy",
    ". we aim at deriving rate - explicit a priori error estimates and the influence of rough potentials on these rates .",
    "the list of references to numerical approaches for solving the nls ( both time - dependent and stationary ) is long and includes @xcite and the references therein .",
    "a priori error estimates for @xmath8 finite element approximations for the nls have been studied in @xcite , where an implicit euler discretization is considered in @xcite , a mass conservative one - stage gauss - legendre implicit runge - kutta scheme is analyzed in @xcite , mass conservative linearly implicit two - step finite element methods are treated in @xcite and higher order ( dg and cg ) time - discretizations are considered in @xcite ( however these higher order schemes lack conservation properties ) . the only scheme that is both mass and energy conservative at the same time is the modified crank - nicolson scheme analyzed by sanz - serna @xcite and akrivis et al .",
    "@xcite , which is also the approach that we shall follow in this contribution .",
    "the analysis of this modified crank - nicolson scheme is devoted to optimal @xmath9-error estimates for sufficiently smooth solutions in both papers @xcite and @xcite .",

    "consider @xmath11 and homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "although the modified crank - nicolson scheme is implicit , in both works , optimal error estimates require a constraint on the coupling between the time step @xmath12 and the mesh size @xmath13 . in @xcite",
    "the constraint reads @xmath14 whereas a relaxed constraint of the form @xmath15 is required in @xcite .",

    "the present paper generalizes the results of akrivis et al .",
    "@xcite to the case of a broader class of nonlinearities and , more importantly , accounts for potential terms in the nls .",
    "if the potential is sufficiently smooth , even the previous constraints on the time step can be removed without affecting the optimal convergence rates . to the best of our knowledge , the only other paper that includes potential terms in a finite element based nls discretization is @xcite which uses a one - stage gauss - legendre implicit runge - kutta scheme that is not energy - conserving .",
    "while these results essentially require continuous potentials , many physically relevant potentials are discontinuous and very rough .",
    "typical examples are disorder potentials @xcite or potentials representing quantum arrays in the context josephson oscillations @xcite . as the main result of the paper",

    "for @xmath523 we exploit the initial condition and obtain @xmath524 hence @xmath525 analogously , we obtain for @xmath526 that @xmath527 hence @xmath528 furthermore , since @xmath529 where @xmath530 ( for which we just derived corresponding bounds depending on @xmath501 ) , we can also conclude by elliptic regularity theory that @xmath531 from the equation @xmath532 we also make an important observation : we have @xmath533 , however we do _ not _ have @xmath374-regularity as this would require @xmath534 , which is clearly not available due to the roughness of @xmath509 .",
    "therefore we can not repeat the same argument for @xmath535 .",
    "observe that for @xmath536 we have @xmath537 which implies that @xmath538 , but it is not in @xmath260 . in order to obtain @xmath539",
    "we would require the disorder potential to be at lest in @xmath65 ( which contradicts the notion of a disorder potential ) .",
    "consequently , we can neither hope for @xmath539 nor for @xmath540 .",
    "the only thing that we can hope for is to verify @xmath541 . and indeed , analogously to the proof of energy conservation we easily observe that @xmath542 with we conclude that the right - hand side is well - defined and bounded for rough potentials @xmath509 .",
    "@xmath41 in the nonlinear case similar arguments can be used .",
    "however , the calculations become significantly more technical since we typically do no longer have the conservation properties such as @xmath544 for @xmath545 . still for small times",
    "it is possible to show an inequality which takes a comparable role .",
    "for instance , in the case of the cubic nonlinearity @xmath6 ( where @xmath546 is a parameter that characterizes the type and the number of particles ) it is possible to show that there exists a minimum time @xmath21 and constant @xmath547 ( independent of the regularity of the potential ) , such that @xmath548 for @xmath549 and provided that @xmath88 is sufficiently smooth . with this",
    "it is possible to proceed in a similar way as in the linear case and we can draw the same conclusions ."
