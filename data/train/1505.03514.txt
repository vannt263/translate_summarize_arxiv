    "disk - satellite interactions have been studied for decades .",
    "the general problem of an orbiting point mass interacting gravitationally with a surrounding disk of either gas or solids is a fundamental physics problem with a multitude of applications in astrophysics .",
    "saturn s rings , for example , are an exquisite testbed for disk - satellite interactions in the case where the disk is composed entirely of solids @xcite . for the hydrodynamic case ,",
    "how a planet interacts with the gaseous disk which spawned it is of great importance to the question of how the planets formed",
    ". it also provides a vital keystone in our interpretation of observational data , both of extrasolar planetary systems and of debris disks around newly formed stars .",
    "additionally , disk - satellite interactions are of importance to the orbital evolution of a black hole binary embedded in a circumbinary disk .",
    "the linear theory of hydrodynamical disk - planet interactions has been very successful so far @xcite .",
    "predictions of the disk s linear response to the planet and subsequent predictions of the disk perturbation s gravitational influence on the planet have been accurately reproduced in numerical studies .",
    "this is true for questions of planetary ( type i ) migration rates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and of the eccentricity evolution of the planet ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the details of nonlinear theory , however , have not all been reproduced in numerical studies . in linear theory ,",
    "a spiral wave is excited by the planet , and passes politely through the disk .",
    "after each wave front passes , it leaves no trace of its presence . a nonlinear wave , however , can shock . when it does so , it imparts its angular momentum to the disk , causing fluid elements to move away from the planet s position .",
    "this process carves out a low - density annulus in the vicinity of the planet s orbit .",
    "this low - density region is known as a  gap \" , and its detailed properties have eluded a robust and numerically reproducible semi - analytical description for some time .",
    "many attempts have been made to describe this three - dimensional system with a one - dimensional model , to predict the gap structure , i.e. the surface density @xmath4 as a function of radius @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite took the disk evolution equations of @xcite and added a planetary torque term , to predict the width and shape of gaps .",
    "the calculated gaps turned out to be much wider than those seen in numerical studies .",
    "@xcite attempted to fix this by adding a component due to  pressure torque \" in the disk .",
    "however , both of these studies predicted gaps which were much too deep . in part , this is because the model for torque deposition was too simplistic ; for example , the torque from the planet was calculated locally , even though the transfer of angular momentum from the planet to the disk by shocks is an inherently nonlocal process , as the wave must propagate some distance before shocking . additionally , these studies considered the role of planetary torque as a barrier holding back the viscous accretion of gas .",
    "such considerations predict strict criteria for gap opening @xcite but semi - analytical and numerical studies have demonstrated that planets can violate these criteria and still open gaps on long timescales @xcite .",
    "similarly problematic assumptions have been made for 1d models of circumbinary disks .",
    "disk models of @xcite and later @xcite implicitly assume that if the planet does not migrate with the gas , there is a  pile - up \" of gas at the outer edge of the gap .",
    "in contrast , the disk model of @xcite considered gas flow across the gap , but even that study assumed that the planet s presence affected the accretion rate at infinity .",
    "not only are many of these assumptions incorrect ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but they also result in gap profiles which are inconsistent with numerical experiments .",
    "the gap profiles in these studies generally predict exponentially deep gaps ; that is , the surface density near the planet is depleted by a factor @xmath6 relative to the unperturbed state , where @xmath1 is the planet - to - star mass ratio , and @xmath7 is some critical threshold for gap opening .",
    "on the other hand , several recent numerical parameter surveys have shown that gap depth scales as a power - law with @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite , so that gaps are not as depleted as in the 1d models .",
    "@xcite provided an argument for the power - law scalings found in @xcite , pointing out that the torque produced by the planet would be proportional to the surface density in the gap near the planet s position @xmath8 , assuming that the torque was dominated by resonances excited inside the gap .",
    "very recently , @xcite produced a 1d model for gaps which repeated the arguments of @xcite , recovering the power - law scaling of @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite used an incomplete description of the planetary torque . for most of their study ,",
    "the torque was specified as the _ excitation _ torque in the disk , as calculated by linear theory , whereas the torque which controls gap opening is the _ deposition _ torque , i.e. the rate of transfer of angular momentum from the planetary wake to the disk by shocks .",
    "they attempted to fold this into their study by including a parameter @xmath9 which measured the distance the wave travels from the planet before shocking .",
    "the resultant gap profile was then some function of the quantity @xmath9 , which was treated as a free parameter .",
    "fortunately , the process of excitation and deposition of torque in the disk has been studied by @xcite ( hereafter gr01 ) .",
    "therefore , there is no need to speculate about this process , at least in the weakly nonlinear regime . in the present study , the planetary angular momentum flux derived by gr01",
    "is applied to a disk model similar to @xcite .",
    "these disk equations can then be solved _ algebraically _ for the surface density , so that it is not necessary to perform any numerical integrals as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the model is described in section [ sec : anly ] . in section [ sec : results ] , the resultant gap profile @xmath0 is compared with gap profiles from a recent parameter survey @xcite and agreement is found , particularly in the  partial gap \" regime .",
    "this provides confidence that a complete 1d disk model may be possible after taking into account higher - order effects .",
    "a summary and discussion is given in section [ sec : disc ] .",
    "these results may be testable observationally in the not - too - distant future , as the alma project may be capable of measuring surface density profiles in transition disks .",
    "the initial approach here is essentially equivalent to that of @xcite , though the underlying equations will be derived in a slightly different manner . rather than using the equation of mass flux to derive a differential equation for @xmath0 , a planetary torque term is inserted into the equation of angular momentum flux , and the fluxes at infinity",
    "are assumed to be unaffected by the presence of the planet .",
    "the system is then solved algebraically .",
    "the equations of mass and angular momentum conservation in a steady - state viscous disk are as follows ( ignoring the planet , at first ) :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the mass accretion rate , @xmath12 is the angular momentum flux , @xmath13 is the radial drift velocity , @xmath14 is the orbital angular velocity of the gas , and @xmath15 is the kinematic viscosity .",
    "all quantities are vertically and azimuthally averaged .",
    "the accretion rate is defined so that positive @xmath11 implies inward accretion . the first term in ( [ eqn : jdot ] ) is the flux due to advection , and the second term is due to viscous torques .",
    "assuming keplerian @xmath14 ( as will generally be done for simplicity in this study ) , equation ( [ eqn : jdot ] ) becomes @xmath16    there are two possible solutions such that @xmath11 and @xmath12 are both spatially uniform .",
    "the first is @xmath17 , @xmath18 constant , and the second is @xmath19 constant , @xmath20 , so that viscous angular momentum transport outwards exactly cancels advective transport inwards .",
    "the latter solution will be concentrated on in this study , as there is zero accretion in the former solution .",
    "however , the @xmath17 solution does not pose any additional challenges , and what follows would be nearly identical ( a linear combination of the two is also possible , but again this is ignored in the current study for simplicity ) .",
    "thus , for this ( unperturbed ) solution , the surface density @xmath4 is inversely proportional to the viscosity , @xmath15 . if",
    "@xmath15 is spatially uniform , then @xmath4 will also be , in steady state .",
    "once the constants @xmath11 and @xmath12 are known , one can add a planetary torque as an additional source of angular momentum flux :    @xmath21    @xmath22 is the angular momentum flux generated by the planet ; the torque density deposited by shocks is given by the negative derivative of this function .",
    "note that it is assumed that the planet does not affect the values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 at infinity , so that in particular the gap does not act as a  barrier \" preventing mass flux through the system .",
    "the surface density @xmath0 adjusts itself to maintain these values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the presence of the planet .",
    "the value of @xmath11 is the unperturbed value , the same as it would be in absence of the planet :    @xmath23    ( the viscosity @xmath15 can also depend on radius , but this notation was omitted for simplicity ) .",
    "the planet s influence is entirely housed in the planetary angular momentum flux , @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath22 is determined by how far the wave propagates before shocking , and how quickly its angular momentum is transferred to the disk after shocking .",
    "this process has been studied by @xcite , and their calculations provide a clear prescription for @xmath22 which applies in the weakly nonlinear regime .",
    "the specific details of this function will be discussed further in section [ sec : phir ] , but the overall scaling is given by the one - sided torque emanating from the planet :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the radial position of the planet , @xmath8 is the surface density at the planet s position @xmath26 , @xmath1 is the planet - to - star mass ratio , and @xmath27 is the mach number ( the inverse of the disk aspect ratio @xmath2 ) .",
    "@xmath28 is a dimensionless function of @xmath5 , discussed later . near the planet",
    ", @xmath29 evaluates to @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is some dimensionless order - unity constant .",
    "note that there is an implicit assumption that the waves are excited within the gap , so that the angular momentum flux is proportional to the density in the gap , @xmath8 .    evaluating ( [ eqn : phip ] ) at the planetary position ( also incorporating ( [ eqn : mdot ] ) for the mass flux ) gives :    @xmath32    this can be inverted to find a formula for gap depth :    @xmath33    this recovers the gap depth scaling reported in @xcite .",
    "this exercise was also effectively carried out by @xcite , and by @xcite .",
    "more specifically ,    @xmath34    where    @xmath35    and @xmath3 is the dimensionless shakura - sunyaev viscosity parameter , @xmath36 .",
    "figure [ fig : depths ] compares gap depths from equation ( [ eqn : a ] ) with steady - state 2d solutions from a numerical parameter survey over @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath27 @xcite , demonstrating the accuracy of this formula over a wide range of parameter space . for these 84 disk models ,",
    "the only significant deviation from equation ( [ eqn : a ] ) is in the @xmath37 range , where higher - order effects become important . for larger values of @xmath38",
    ", @xcite found that this scaling eventually changes , suggesting that higher - order effects become important for very large @xmath39 .",
    "this figure was used to constrain the one free parameter @xmath40 .",
    "this value of @xmath31 is also consistent with the one - sided torque calculated numerically in these disk models ( @xmath41 , where the @xmath42 sign indicates the torque excited on either side of the planet , with the greater torque excited in the outer disk ) . after choosing @xmath40 ,",
    "the model is completely specified .",
    "now with this value of @xmath8 , one can return to the original @xmath12 equation :    @xmath43    given @xmath44 , which was calculated above ( [ eqn : a ] ) , one can solve ( [ eqn : final ] ) for @xmath0 :    @xmath45    the function @xmath28 is a scaled - out version of the angular momentum flux due to the shocking of the planetary wake , which has been calculated semi - analytically by @xcite in shearing - box coordinates , and this result has been extended to global disk coordinates by @xcite . therefore , there is a well - specified formula for @xmath22 throughout the entire disk , specifically applicable for low - mass planets whose planetary influence is weakly nonlinear . by design ,",
    "this is only meant to apply if the quantity @xmath46 , meaning for sub - jupiter planets .",
    "however , it may be possible to improve the semi - analytic calculation of @xmath22 , leading to an accurate model for all planet masses .",
    "this will be attempted in a future study .    for the present study ,",
    "the formula for @xmath22 comes from the calculations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the wave conserves its angular momentum until it shocks and deposits its angular momentum into the disk .",
    "therefore , the function @xmath28 is simply a constant , until the distance from the planet that the wave shocks .",
    "the explicit shape of this function is shown in figure 3 of gr01 , and its extension to a global disk is shown in figure 3 of @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath28 can be described in terms of the parameter @xmath47 :    @xmath48    where the shock position @xmath49 was calculated by @xcite , and is given by    @xmath50    the parameter @xmath47 represents an appropriately - scaled distance from the planet . in shearing - box coordinates ,",
    "this is given by    @xmath51    to apply this to a global disk , in which surface density and sound speed vary as @xmath52 and @xmath53 , one must perform the following integral    @xmath54    which can be integrated analytically and expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions .",
    "equations ( [ eqn : b]),([eqn : c]),([eqn : d ] ) , and ( [ eqn : e ] ) completely specify the value of the surface density at every point in the disk , given the parameters @xmath1 , @xmath3 , and @xmath2 , and the background surface density profile @xmath55 .",
    "the accuracy and range of applicability of this simple analytical model are tested by comparing directly with numerical calculations from the extensive parameter survey of @xcite . in that survey ,",
    "three parameters were varied : mass ratio @xmath1 , mach number @xmath27 ( or equivalently @xmath56 ) , and viscosity @xmath15 ( or equivalently , @xmath57 .",
    "figure [ fig : mass ] shows variation with mass ratio for a disk with @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "mass ratios from @xmath60 to @xmath61 are studied showing a wide range of applicability of the 1d model .",
    "near @xmath61 ( jupiter - mass ) , the model begins to break down as the gap is significantly wider than predicted , but the depth of the gap is still reasonably accurate .",
    "the reason for the deviation around jupiter - mass is likely that all of the excitation is assumed to come from within the gap , whereas once the gap becomes deep enough , the dominant resonances live just outside the gap edges .",
    "it is likely that a great deal of improvement would come from modifying the function @xmath22 to account for excitation of waves in the presence of the detailed shape of the gap .",
    "figure [ fig : visc ] shows variation of the gap profile with viscosity , for a @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) planet in a disk with @xmath64 ( @xmath58 ) . the gap depth and shape",
    "is accurately captured for this range of viscosities .    finally , figure [ fig : temp ] shows dependence on disk temperature ( equivalently @xmath27 or @xmath2 ) for @xmath62 , @xmath59 ( @xmath3 is fixed , but @xmath65 varies with @xmath27 ) .",
    "the shape of the gap is reasonably well - captured , but again once the gap becomes deep enough , there is a similar deviation from the model ( this same deviation occurs at around @xmath66 in figure [ fig : depths ] ; note that the last panel in this figure has @xmath67 ) .",
    "this analytic model should be improved for the case of deep gaps ( this is planned for a future study ) , but it accurately captures the  partial gap \" regime , and the basic fundamentals are correct in that the scalings of @xcite are reproduced , and low - mass planets can also open gaps in sufficiently low - viscosity disks , which has also been seen numerically @xcite .",
    "a simple analytical model has been presented for gap profiles in protoplanetary disks . in this model ,",
    "effects due to planetary torque come directly from the detailed calculations of shock propagation by gr01 , and @xcite .",
    "the model is solved algebraically , and compared with long - duration numerical calculations .",
    "the model s performance in the  partial gap \" regime is unprecedented in its agreement with numerical calculations and its reproduction of empirically found scalings . for deep gaps",
    ", the model does not correctly predict the gap shape .",
    "this is most likely due to the fact that resonances located several scale heights from the planet become dominant once the gap suppresses the resonances nearest the planet .",
    "additionally , effects due to non - keplerian orbital motion should become important for very deep gaps .",
    "one could envision an iterative procedure for folding these effects into the analytic formula .",
    "for example , given the profile @xmath0 , one could calculate the contribution of the torque from all resonances in the disk .",
    "this could give a new form for @xmath22 , which would provide a corrected surface density via equation ( [ eqn : final ] ) .",
    "this process could be repeated until a converged gap profile is found .",
    "such a procedure will be attempted in a future study ."
