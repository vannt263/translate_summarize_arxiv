    "the spin-@xmath8 @xmath0 chain and its variants are among the most widely used and quoted models in theoretical investigations on spin systems .",
    "this popularity among theorists is due to two facts . on the one hand",
    ", this family of models allows for exact theoretical description of many static as well as dynamic properties(see ref .",
    "- ) , and on the other hand , in some important cases , it provides a good description of real systems @xcite . as an example",
    ", we note that the dimerized chain , with alternating antiferromagnetic bonds , has been studied in relation with the spin - peierls transition@xcite , and it is thought to represent the spin degrees of freedom of organic compounds that undergo the so called _",
    "peierls distortion_. the present state of the art in fabricating low dimensional systems , with the material science technology developed after the synthesis of the superconducting cuprate oxides , may now tailor compounds that reveal a wealth of new magnetic phenomena , including random spin chains , spin ladders , and doped magnetic chains among other systems with exotic behaviors . for theorists ,",
    "these systems are fascinating , with no parallel in classical or three - dimensional physics .",
    "being systems of low dimensionality with low values of the spin , they are dominated by quantum effects@xcite .",
    "compounds such as @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 _ ethyl sulfate _ ) , and @xmath12 are among the quasi - one - dimensional systems , whose low temperature properties are thought to be described by the @xmath0 model .",
    "a great deal of theoretical information has been gathered concerning equilibrium properties , with calculations of quantities such as the specific heat , the magnetic susceptibility , and equal - time spin - spin correlation functions@xcite .    as for the dynamic properties ,",
    "the quantities most thoroughly studied are the time - dependent spin - spin correlation functions ( tdcf ) @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the hamiltonian of the system , @xmath15 is an index for the spin component ( @xmath16 ) , and @xmath17 is the equilibrium average@xcite .",
    "they are important for the description of such dynamic phenomena as magnetic resonance , magnetic neutron scattering , spin diffusion , and other relaxation properties@xcite .",
    "it should be noted however , that their application is restricted to situations near the equilibrium state , where the linear response theory is valid@xcite . in particular , for the uniform @xmath0 model , an old calculation for the time dependent autocorrelation @xmath18 showed the absence of spin diffusion in the limit @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this behavior was thought to be accidental and specific of the @xmath0 model for spin 1/2 ( see , for example , ref . ) .",
    "however , recent research has shown that this surprising property is shared by a whole family of integrable models , and is attributed to the existence of a macroscopic number of conservation laws@xcite .",
    "this remarkable result has been probed in magnetic resonance experiments in some 1d systems@xcite .",
    "we will turn to this point later .    in spite of the wide range of their applicability",
    ", we note that tdcf do not give a direct description of the time evolution of the non - equilibrium process@xcite .",
    "this description is achieved through a different method , that we briefly discuss below .    this second direction in investigating the dynamics relies on calculation of averages of the type : @xmath19~ ,   \\label{ave}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the density matrix which satisfies liouville equation @xmath21\\ . \\label{liouville}\\ ] ] averages of such a kind give a direct account of the non - equilibrium evolution of the physical observable @xmath22 , independently of how far the initial state is from the equilibrium state or from a stationary one .",
    "unfortunately , calculations of these quantities are much more involved than the calculation of tdcf ( [ cf ] ) for linear response , and few exact results are known @xcite .",
    "whether the dynamical process is near or far from equilibrium , most works in the literature deal with cases where the initial state is _ spatially uniform_. this premise is assumed in explicit or non - explicit way , and the methods developed to solve the problem are heavily based on it .",
    "in contrast , the study of spatially nonuniform excitations is practically new , in spite of its interest , both theoretical and experimental .",
    "this problem is important for a deeper understanding of dynamical processes in many - particle spin systems with strong exchange interactions .",
    "inhomogeneous initial states can be prepared in real systems by external actions , for instance , strong inhomogeneous magnetic fields or acoustic waves . on the other hand , from the theoretical side , exact results on the dynamics ( as in the case of the @xmath0 model ) ,",
    "can elucidate details of spin - spin relaxation processes in more complicate systems .    in the present contribution",
    ", we will adopt the method based on formulae ( [ ave ] ) and ( [ liouville ] ) , and will analyze in detail the long time evolution of the magnetization in three versions of the @xmath0 model .",
    "the initial excitation is always prepared in the form of a spatially inhomogeneous magnetization ( sim ) , and the calculation is done in exact analytic form .",
    "the three variants of the @xmath0 model that we consider are enumerated below :    1 .",
    "isotropic dimerized @xmath0 model with hamiltonian : @xmath23 ; \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] 2 .",
    "isotropic @xmath0 model in a staggered magnetic field with hamiltonian :    @xmath24    1 .   @xmath0 model with bond alternation without magnetic field : @xmath25    we will refer to them as models i , ii , iii , respectively . in expressions ( [ dimer])-([bond ] ) , @xmath26  @xmath27  is the bohr magneton , @xmath28 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath29 ,  @xmath30 ,  @xmath31  are magnetic fields , @xmath32 ,  @xmath33 ,  @xmath34 ,  @xmath35 ,  @xmath36  are exchange integrals , @xmath37 , and  @xmath38 ) , and cyclic boundary conditions are assumed .",
    "the above restriction on @xmath39 ,  @xmath34  and @xmath32  is not important in our problem and is introduced for convenience .    to investigate sim dynamics in the above models , we will use a previously developed method given in ref ..",
    "this method was applied earlier by one of the authors@xcite , to the same study for the isotropic @xmath0 chain in a homogeneous magnetic field , with hamiltonian : @xmath40 we will refer to this model as model iv subsequently .",
    "we remark that highly nontrivial results were obtained in ref .. in particular , it was shown that in the @xmath41 limit , some of the spatially inhomogeneous excitations do not disappear and are still time - dependent",
    ". the time evolution of sim s ( and also their spatial distribution ) is probed through the computation of the fourier components @xmath42 of the magnetization as a function of the @xmath5-wave number .",
    "the calculation yields a relaxation process in the form of a power law @xmath43 where the exponent @xmath44 depends on the initial state . in ref .",
    "it was also studied the anisotropic @xmath0 model in the limit of strong anisotropy .",
    "it was found that the exponent @xmath44 in ( [ power ] ) changes discontinuously at some critical values @xmath7 of the wave vector @xmath5 .",
    "the values @xmath7 depend solely on the parameters of the hamiltonian and are not connected with the preparation of the initial state , nor the particular component of the magnetization that is relaxing .",
    "moreover , in the limit @xmath45 , the relaxation time @xmath46 of ( [ power ] ) diverges to @xmath47 , with the corresponding slowing down of the process .",
    "this phenomenon is at variance with some conventional views for the time evolution of physical quantities in many particle systems , according to which all quantities must be temporal independent in the limit @xmath41 .",
    "the concept of spin temperature , widely used in non - equilibrium magnetic phenomena @xcite , is based on the assumption that the spin - spin relaxation is much faster than the final relaxation to the lattice degrees of freedom .",
    "model i was also preliminary investigated by the some of the authors , and similar conclusions were attained for the dimerized @xmath0 model@xcite , in the sense that a critical - like slowing down of the relaxation process takes place at special points @xmath48 of the @xmath5-space . in other words , for @xmath49 ,",
    "the inverse time scale  @xmath50 for some of the oscillating components of sim , goes to zero following the power law @xmath51 .",
    "such behavior is not surprising for the case @xmath52 , for which the corresponding value  of the total magnetization @xmath53  is a constant of motion , but is unusual for @xmath54 where the corresponding fourier component @xmath55 is not conserved .",
    "we note that @xmath56 is the only critical point for the uniform isotropic @xmath0 model ( model iv and limit @xmath57 for model i and @xmath58 for model ii ) .",
    "the @xmath41 behavior is dominated by one oscillating component , and this component has no critical properties . the present paper is devoted to elucidate this remarkable difference within a more general context , by the extensive study of a whole family of models .",
    "we suggest that the dissimilar behaviors are due to the presence of a gap in the spectrum of the energy excitations , the uniform isotropic model being gapless .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we outline the main steps in the analytic calculation .",
    "all the models are diagonalized by means of a modified jordan - wigner transformation , which maps the spin model into an equivalent fermion hamiltonian . then",

    "@xmath135 with @xmath136  .",
    "in this section , we firstly discuss general properties of the time evolution of the magnetization , which can be inferred directly from equations ( [ 22 ] ) and ( [ null])-([sqtziv ] ) . in addition , we will study in detail the asymptotic behavior at long times , in the limit @xmath41 .",
    "we will show that the evolution of sim s displays interesting unusual features , depending on the wave vector @xmath5 characterizing the inhomogeneous initial state .",
    "let us first consider model i in the case @xmath125 for the initial density matrix , since it presents a specific feature that is absent in the other models studied here . from equations ( [ 22 ] ) and ( [ sqtzi])-([def ] ) , one sees that the value of the magnetization @xmath59 at @xmath138 , depends on the initial values of the two fourier components @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "this means that , if only one component of @xmath55 exists at @xmath141 , for example for wave vector @xmath142 , _ i.e. _ @xmath143 then a twofold response develops for @xmath144 , with components @xmath145  and  @xmath146 , whose time evolution is described by equation ( [ 22 ] ) , with @xmath147 and @xmath148 , respectively .",
    "in contrast , for models ii - iv , if there is only one initial component @xmath149 , only one component @xmath59 of the same wave vector @xmath150 exists at subsequent times , @xmath144  .",

    "this result may be understood intuitively , without any calculation , if one notes that the part of the hamiltonian that describes the coupling of spins with the magnetic field , commutes with the other one describing the exchange interactions ( in the case of model iii , this statement is trivial for we only have the exchange part ) . denoting the latter as @xmath152 , we get the time evolution @xmath153 ~ ,   \\label{x1}\\ ] ] which is governed by the exchange only . inside the trace in ( [ x1 ] ) , we now perform a unitary transformation consisting in a rotation by @xmath154around the @xmath124  axis . under this operation ,",
    "the spin operators transform as follow : @xmath155 the exchange hamiltonian @xmath152 is invariant under this transformation because it is a sum of products of the form @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "the initial density matrix @xmath68 is also invariant since it only depends on the @xmath158 component of the spins ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "so , the right hand side of equation ( [ x1 ] ) will change its sign , yielding @xmath160",
    "i.e. @xmath161  .    in the case of model ii , the exchange part does not commute with the total hamiltonian @xmath162 .",
    "this leads , in general , to a nonvanishing @xmath151 , for @xmath144 , which results proportional to @xmath163 , where @xmath164is the fourier transform of the spin - spin correlation function @xmath165evaluated at the initial condition ( see relation ( [ fourier ] ) ) .",
    "if the initial state is prepared with a single @xmath5-vector in the form @xmath166 , then @xmath167 is the only component that exists for @xmath144  .    for @xmath168 ( homogeneous initial state ) , and for any @xmath72 , we get the ( evident ) result : @xmath169 for models i , ii , iv .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the conservation of the total @xmath62-component of the magnetization . in the case of model iii , when @xmath125 , we get the closed result@xmath170@xmath171 where @xmath172  .    another important property valid for models i , ii and iv , and for any @xmath173 , is that the evolution of sim s is independent of the value of external field @xmath29  .",
    "this fact is not surprising because the zeeman term of the respective hamiltonians commutes with both , the remaining part describing the exchange interaction and the operator @xmath55  .",
    "this way , the time evolution of sim s is determined by the exchange term only .",
    "special important limits are @xmath174 in model i and @xmath175 in model ii , that map onto model iv . in both of these cases , the corresponding formulae for @xmath59  reduce to ( [ sqtziv ] ) which was obtained in ref . .    unfortunately , it is difficult to get more information from formulae ( [ 22 ] ) , ( [ sqtx ] ) , ( [ def ] ) , and ( [ sqtzii ] ) , because they are rather involved .",
    "so , in the following , we will consider the limiting case @xmath60 , that will be studied using the stationary phase method .",
    "according to the stationary phase method @xcite , the long - time evolution of @xmath59 is dominated by the contribution of the stationary points of the functions @xmath176 .",
    "the number of these points depends on the value of the wave vector @xmath5 . for convenience of further discussion ,",

    "we use periodic boundary conditions for the spin hamiltonian and take the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath61 ) before studing asymptotic long times . as remarked in ref .",
    ", the order of the limits is very important .",
    "all the models treated here , show long time tails in the relaxation of @xmath292 , which is apparent from the asymptotic study for @xmath1 , developed in the previous sections .",
    "this behavior manifests itself in the form of a power law decay in the long time evolution of sim s .",
    "this slow relaxation is a remarkable result for its own sake and is probably due to the absence of dissipation in the models .",
    "since the systems are isolated at zero temperature , the dynamics is exclusively driven by quantum fluctuations .",
    "our calculation also shows striking differences , when one compares the behaviors of models i and ii on the one hand , with models iii and iv , on the other .",
    "the dissimilarity lies in the presence of critical values @xmath293 for the wave vector @xmath5 , where we get a slowing down of the relaxation process . near critical points , the time scale  @xmath225 , giving the relaxation of a specific oscillating component of @xmath292 , diverges with the law @xmath294 , for @xmath295 , reducing the damping of these excitations .",
    "such behavior is not surprising for the case @xmath296 , for which the corresponding value  @xmath297  is an integral of the motion , but is unusual for the case @xmath298 when @xmath55 is not conserved . in this sense ,",
    "the criticality at @xmath299 , @xmath300 has different implications in the theory .",
    "the position of the critical values @xmath301 and @xmath300 depends only on parameters of the hamiltonian , and in the limit @xmath302 , the exponent @xmath44 jumps discontinuously , the relaxation rate becoming slower than for excitations with @xmath303 .",
    "this means that the critical components will be the only surviving ones at long enough times .",
    "these long - lived excitations may be pictured as spin density waves ( charge density waves for the fermion model ) with incommensurate wave vector @xmath304 , which are developed in our gapped models as a consequence of the peierls instability@xcite .",
    "in contrast , the dynamics of models iii and iv does not have such anomalies . there is no gap in the spectrum , and in the language of particles , the systems are always metallic and display no critical points ( except the point @xmath56 ) . in the asymptotic regime @xmath41 ,",
    "only one oscillating component exists which displays no critical behavior .",
    "peculiar properties of the energy spectrum seem to determine the critical relaxation phenomena .",
    "in fact , models i and ii display an energy gap between the ground and excited states , whose size is monitored by the parameter @xmath305 ( for model ii through the transformation ( [ normalized ] ) ) .",
    "the existence of critical points is directly related to the presence of the gap , since the latter changes the curvature of the dispersion relation for the energy . if one looks at formula ( [ sqt ] ) for the fourier component @xmath69 of the magnetization , one realizes that processes which contribute with the @xmath306 frequency ( the one that is critical ) come from transitions between both branches of the spectrum ( interband transitions ) , where a particle with momentum @xmath307 is destroyed in a given band , and a particle with momentum @xmath308 is created in the other one , with a net momentum transfer @xmath309 .",
    "so the criticality at @xmath304 is not directly related to the one particle spectrum , but to a big density of states for those interband transitions that exchange the same momentum @xmath309 coherently ( constructive interference ) .",
    "nesting _ condition is attained at @xmath310 , with the onset of a spin density wave for the @xmath53 magnetization .",
    "however , we have found that the above anomalous behavior in the relaxation is not an exclusive property of the peierls transition .",
    "in fact , other _ 1-dim _ gapped spin models , as the @xmath0 chain with anisotropic interactions , present the same slowing down of the relaxation at special points ( ref . treats the ising limit ) . a general connection between this critical behavior and the spectral properties is still lacking and currently under research@xcite .",
    "our results are all exact , with closed analytical forms , from where the asymptotic regime for @xmath1 is obtained .",
    "this has been done using the fermion representation of the jordan - wigner approach for spin chains .",
    "other procedures to solve the same systems are available , the most conspicuous being the bethe ansatz method , which applied to the @xmath0 model might hint at `` hidden '' conservation laws of the several versions of the model treated here . however , it is difficult to conceive a similar analytic calculation of the relaxation properties , using bethe ansatz techniques .",
    "we remark that integrable models displays other unusual dynamical phenomena , with anomalies in the transport properties@xcite . for the heisenberg model ,",
    "the absence of spin diffusion has been probed by bosonization techniques@xcite and numerical calculations@xcite .",
    "presents exact numerical computations for the spin-1/2 @xmath311 chain at @xmath312 , which include , as particular cases , the isotropic heisenberg model and the @xmath0 regime , which are gapless , and the heisenberg - ising model , with a gap in the spectrum and long - range order for the ground state .",
    "numerical data is inconclusive due to finite - size effects , but there are strong hints of a crossover from non - diffusive to diffusive behavior when we go from the gapless region to the gapped one .",
    "concerning the low - temperature properties , a calculation by sachdev and damle@xcite in the gapped region , shows that the diffusive behavior holds in the presence of long - range order .",
    "it is however puzzling to admit that low energy properties of the spectrum may affect the @xmath313 behavior .    from a more fundamental point of view",
    ", we have studied the time evolution of a closed quantum many body system ( at zero temperature ) , which is prepared in an arbitrary nonhomogeneous initial state .",
    "the dynamics is solely given by the schrdinger equation for the wave function or by the liouville equation for the density operator ( which includes the more general situation of a mixed ensemble for the initial state ) .",
    "surprisingly , in the thermodynamic limit and for long times ( @xmath103 first than the limit @xmath1 ) , we get irreversibility in the form of a power law relaxation for the magnetization , in spite that the dynamics is unitary .",
    "no internal interactions are present , since all the hamiltonians are reduced to the free - particle form .",
    "the irreversibility can be entirely ascribed to interference effects , that in our calculation are handled using the stationary phase method at asymptotic long times .",
    "due to constructive interference , gapped models develop long - lived collective excitations with the texture of spin density waves ( charge density waves for the fermion versions ) , that persist for longer times .",
    "we believe that those structures are universal features of gapped one - dimensional models .",
    "finally , our simple quantum systems are good candidates for _ aging _ effects , a concept that has been coined to specify nonequilibrium dynamics that depends on the initial conditions and relaxes very `` slowly''@xcite . but a complete characterization of quantum aging requires the calculation of the two - times correlation functions@xcite .",
    "we illustrate our method with the calculation of the averages @xmath314 , ( @xmath315 ) , for models i and ii . after taking",
    "the inverse of the bogolyubov transformation @xmath316 one obtains : @xmath317 then using definition ( [ blochop ] ) and relations @xmath318 where @xmath319 are the spin ladder operators and @xmath320 is the _ string _ operator of the jordan - wigner transformation  ( [ jw ] ) , it is possible to reduce the problem to calculation of the following spin averages : @xmath321 all the averages above are taken with the initial density matrix @xmath68 .",
    "if this is assumed to have the form ( [ inirho ] ) , then most averages that involve products of different components of spin operators vanish .",
