    "below , we present our derivations for the velocity gradient in each source and our derived dynamical masses . in section [ subsec : outflow_contam ]",
    "we present a caveat to the velocity gradient derivation for w51e8 .",

    "we then fit 2d gaussians to the line emission . in each pv diagram , the gaussians were fit to the 3 or 5 @xmath9 level as stated in the figure captions .",
    "the projected major and minor axes of these ellipses gave the angular extent and velocity shift across each source .",
    "the calculated velocity gradients for each source are shown in table [ tab : results ] where the uncertainties arise from the velocity channel spacing ( 0.53 km s@xmath5 ) and spatial resolution ( 0.3@xmath3 ) of the observations .",
    "it is interesting to note that the velocity gradients in g28.2 are differently oriented from each other in the pv diagram , yet result in the same dynamical mass .",
    "while the change in velocity across the sources is the same for both species , the higher velocity gas is at different positions .",
    "this is possibly due to the two species being slightly offset from each other as seen in the right hand panel of figure [ fig : g28 ] .",
    "if we assume that the material in these regions is in virial equilibrium , we can determine the dynamical mass of the enclosed region . because we can not constrain the inclination angle of these rotating structures from our observations ,",
    "we will assume that the velocity gradients are observed primarily ` edge on ' ( i.e. the observed velocities are the true velocities of the gas ) and thus our derived masses are lower limits to the true masses for structures which are inclined with respect to the plane of the sky .",
    "we find velocity gradients in the range of 92 - 175 km s@xmath5 pc@xmath5 and note that the values derived for a given source from so@xmath0 and ocs agree to within one or two times the quoted uncertainties , which is why only the so@xmath0 values are given in table [ tab : results ] .",
    "that these values are so similar suggest that so@xmath0 and ocs are tracing the same bulk motions .",
    "the velocity gradients we present in table [ tab : results ] are comparable to , although generally slightly smaller than , those inferred for three other massive star forming regions ( g24a1 , iras 20126 and iras 18089 ) by applying the same analysis methods described here to the data presented by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ( respectively ) .",
    "these sources were observed at similar resolutions , but are , in general closer than the sources studied here , and do not show evidence for hii regions .",
    "we find that our results are generally higher than the velocity gradient found in the low mass star forming region l1251 @xcite again using the same analysis on their presented velocity gradients .",
    "our derived velocity gradients result in dynamical masses of between 12 and 364 m@xmath10 .",
    "for all sources except for our unresolved source ( ngc 7538 ) the derived dynamical masses are large enough to account for one ( or more ) massive star and surrounding hii region . because the dynamical mass accounts for all of the mass within its outer emitting region ( i.e. the hot gas and dust inside the hii region as well as the warm molecular gas responsible for the emission ) , we expect these dynamical masses to be the largest values presented here .      in figure [ fig : w51e8 ] we show both an emission map ( left panel ) and a pv diagram ( right panel ) for so@xmath0 and ocs in w51e8 . in the right panel ,",
    "the grayscale shows the ocs emission , and the contours show the so@xmath0 emission . here",
    ", we see that the velocity gradient in so@xmath0 around w51e8 extends to higher red shifted velocities than blue ( from the rest velocity of the source given in table [ tab : observe ] ) .",
    "the solid ellipse shows the ocs emission .",
    "we suggest that the so@xmath0 emission redward of 66 km s@xmath5 is not related to dynamical rotation , and we suggest that the so@xmath0 velocity gradient is being contaminated by outflow emission .",
    "this excess red shifted emission is not observed in ocs ( see panel f of figure [ fig : rotation ] ) ; however the orientation of the velocity gradient in ocs is consistent with that of the so@xmath0 .",
    "if we blindly derive a dynamical mass for this region from the full velocity gradient in so@xmath0 , we estimate an enclosed mass of 930 m@xmath10 .",
    "interestingly the redshifted lobe of the bipolar outflow ( as seen in co , klaassen et al . , in prep . ) from this source is located near the redshifted part of the rotation signature .",
    "it is not clear why there is no corresponding co blueshifted outflow lobe , which makes it hard to determine a concrete outflow direction .",
    "the correlation in both space and velocity between the so@xmath0 emission and co emission suggests we are seeing outflowing material pushing through the so@xmath0 shell of warm gas surrounding the region .",
    "the detection of h30@xmath4 in this region is marginal at best , and while it has been detected as a continuum source at 1.3 cm @xcite , it has not been detected at 3.6 cm ( down to an rms limit of @xmath2 1.2 mjy beam@xmath5 @xcite ) .",
    "these results bring into question whether w51e8 is an hii region .",
    "given the large mass of this region however , if it is not an hii region , we suggest that it is a very young object which is transitioning from hot core to hii region .",
    "if this high velocity redshifted excess is due to the outflow pushing through the warm so@xmath0 emitting region , as suggested by our data , then the molecular outflow observed towards this source is continuing to be powered from within the hii region itself .",
    "if outflows are driven by accretion , this result suggests that accretion is continuing onto the star(s ) present in this hii region .",
    "it is unlikely that this red extension in the emission could come from a remnant type outflow ( see , for instance * ? ? ?",
    "* ) since , by the time the hii region would have grown onto observable scales , the outflow mechanism from within would have stopped ; there would be nothing pushing the so@xmath0 outwards .",
    "we suggest that the rotation signatures of the other sources are not contaminated by outflow since the outflows from those sources are perpendicular to the velocity gradients present in so@xmath0 and can be fit well with a keplerian orbit centered on the local standard of rest velocity of the sources with no red or blue excesses as seen towards w51e8 .",
    "in parallel to the dynamical mass estimates from the so@xmath0 and ocs lines , we can estimate the mass of molecular gas responsible for the emission ( section [ subsec : emission_mass ] ) from the integrated intensities of the lines .",
    "this calculation requires knowing the temperature of the gas in the emitting region .",
    "the gas temperature for each region was independently derived from the k ladders of the j=12 - 11 transition of ch@xmath1cn . from the k ladders",
    ", we also estimate a gas mass as described below .    at 230 ghz , there are two main contributors to the measured continuum emission : a thermal dust component and a component from the free - free emission from the hii region . in section [ subsec : continuum_mass ]",
    "we discuss how the two components were separated and how a gas mass was derived from the thermal dust component . in section",
    "[ subsec : stellar_mass ] we discuss how a minimum stellar mass for each region was derived from the free - free emission from each source .",
    "ch@xmath1cn is a symmetric top molecule , and as such can be used to trace the temperature in its emitting region .",
    "the individual k levels within a specific j transition ( in this case , j=12 - 11 ) are radiatively decoupled , meaning that the different k levels are populated through collisions alone @xcite , and the relative populations of the k components give an estimate of the ambient(kinetic ) temperature through the rotational temperature diagram method described in @xcite .",
    "we defined the emitting region for ch@xmath1cn as twice the area of the fwhm of the integrated intensity of the combined emission from the k=0 - 8 components .",
    "the ch@xmath1cn spectra shown in figure [ fig : ch3cn_gauss_fits ] are averaged over this masked region . in order to determine the integrated intensity of each component in a systematic way",
    ", we followed the procedures outlined in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite which assume local thermodynamic equilibrium and that the gas is optically thin .",
    "gaussian profiles were fit to each component , keeping the widths and relative rest velocities fixed for a given source .",
    "this procedure allows the fitting routines to find the best fit to the rest velocity of ch@xmath1cn in each source .",
    "as highlighted in the middle and bottom panels of figure [ fig : ch3cn_gauss_fits ] , hnco and ch@xmath11cn were within our spectral window but not fit by gaussians .    from the fitted gaussians to each k component , we determined the column density of the upper level which is related to the integrated intensity of the line through    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the column density in the upper level of the k component , @xmath14 is the frequency of the transition , @xmath15 is the einstein a coefficient for that transition , and @xmath16 is the integrated intensity in units of k km s@xmath5 .",
    "@xmath13 is related to the total column density for the emitting region through :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the degeneracy of the upper state , @xmath19 is the partition function , @xmath20 is the total column density of the species , and @xmath21 is the energy above the ground state of the transition ( see the appendix of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "taking the log of both sides of the equation gives @xmath22 .",
    "the ambient temperature can then be determined from the slope of the line of best fit .    in figure",
    "[ fig : temperature ] we show this plot for each of our regions and the derived temperatures are shown in table [ tab : emission_mass ] .",
    "since these lines were observed simultaneously , the relative intensities of the lines are not affected by calibration uncertainties .",
    "the error bars for each data point come from the uncertainties in the gaussian fits , and the uncertainties in the temperatures come from the uncertainty in the linear fit to the points in figure [ fig : temperature ] .",
    "the signal to noise ratios of the gaussian fits to the k=8 components for each source ( as well as the k=7 components for g10.6 and g28.2 ) were not high enough to be included in the fits , or the plots presented in figure [ fig : temperature ] .",
    "also , due to the blending of the k=0,1 components they were also excluded from the linear fits presented in figure [ fig : temperature ] .",
    "ch@xmath1@xmath8cn is detected in three of our sources .",
    "the isotopic ratio of @xmath23c and @xmath8c is approximately 55 @xcite , so the detection of ch@xmath1@xmath8cn suggests our ch@xmath1cn emission is optically thick .",
    "using equation 1 of @xcite , we find optical depths of @xmath245.8 , 50.4 , 35.8 , @xmath248.9 and 16.3 for g10.6 , g28.2 , ngc 7538 , w51e2 and w51e8 respectively .",
    "the lower limits on the optical depths are for sources in which ch@xmath1@xmath8cn was not detected and the rms noise was used as an upper limit on the ch@xmath1@xmath8cn emission peak .",
    "if the gas is optically thick , then we are overestimating the temperatures in our regions and underestimating the column density .    from these data , we find that the temperatures in the warm molecular gas are between 300 and 460 k. these values are slightly higher than the temperature range in which so@xmath0 is expected to be most abundant , which is consistent with our derivations giving upper limits to the temperatures .",
    "@xcite show that the abundance of so@xmath0 dramatically increases at 100 k , and then begins to decline again at temperatures greater than 300 k. this lower temperature limit comes from the activation energy required for h@xmath0 to combine with oh @xcite . at temperatures greater than @xmath2 300 k this reaction becomes much less efficient @xcite .",
    "the temperature range over which ocs has a high abundance is unclear ; however , from the observations of @xcite it appears to have fairly similar abundances towards a number of hot cores .",
    "@xcite show that after 10@xmath25 yr , the abundance of ocs should fall as hocs@xmath26 is removed from the system ( the primary source of ocs ) .",
    "the peak velocities of the ch@xmath1cn lines are consistent with the v@xmath27 for each source ( given in table [ tab : observe ] ) , and have similar emitting regions to the so@xmath0 and ocs gas .",
    "thus , we suggest the ch@xmath1cn is tracing the same gas as the so@xmath0 and ocs , and will use the temperatures derived here to estimate the column densities of ocs and so@xmath0",
    ".      we can find , from equation [ eqn : col_den ] not only an upper limit to the rotational temperature of the ch@xmath1cn emitting region , but the column density of ch@xmath1cn gas responsible for the emission .",
    "the slope of the line of best fit gives the temperature of the region while the y - intercept gives @xmath28 .",
    "using equation a33 from @xcite we can solve for the column density of ch@xmath1cn assuming the temperatures derived above for the partition function . using the optical depth correction technique described in @xcite , we calculated the function c@xmath29 for the optical depths ( see their equations 16 and 22 ) and correct our total column density values accordingly .",
    "we use a ch@xmath1cn abundance of @xmath30 ( an average of the values presented in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and we note that other authors find lower abundances in orion ( i.e. @xmath31 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that these abundances would increase our ch@xmath1cn derived gas masses closer to those presented below from our analysis of so@xmath0 and ocs ; however the abundances presented in @xcite were derived based partially on observations of one of the sources observed here ( w51e2 ) .",
    "we present the masses derived from the ch@xmath1cn emission both assuming optically thin and optically thick emission in table [ tab : emission_mass ] ( the second last , and last columns respectively ) .",
    "from the integrated intensity of a single transition of a molecule ( such as so@xmath0 or ocs ) we can also determine the average column densities of the gas responsible for that emission .",
    "the column density of either so@xmath0 or ocs can be derived by solving equation [ eqn : col_den ] for @xmath20 .",
    "the column density in the observed species can be converted into a molecular gas column density by scaling by the abundance of the species ( here so@xmath0 or ocs ) with respect to h@xmath0 .    for both so@xmath0 and ocs , there are large variations in the abundances given in the literature . by averaging the abundances of these two species from a number of sources",
    "@xcite we find so@xmath0 and ocs abundances of @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( respectively ) .",
    "the ranges in abundances for these two species were 5@xmath34 for so@xmath0 and @xmath35 for ocs .",
    "the mass of each emitting region was determined by multiplying the average molecular column density by the area and by the mass of molecular hydrogen .",
    "we find that , to within our uncertainty estimates , the masses derived from the so@xmath0 are approximately twice those derived from the ocs emission .",
    "for both species , over estimating the temperature acts to over estimate the mass . we find that in general so@xmath0 is observed at a higher signal to noise ratio than ocs , however , given that so@xmath0 begins to deplete out of the gas phase at temperatures greater than 300 k @xcite , we may be overestimating the mass from the so@xmath0 emission by overestimating the abundance with respect to h@xmath0 . this could be artificially inflating our so@xmath0 derived emission masses .",
    "these derived masses represent only the warm gas surrounding each hii region , and do not reflect the hot material within the hii region , or the cold gas exterior to the hot core .",
    "thus , we expect these masses to be lower than the dynamical masses which include the stellar and ionized gas masses within the hii region",
    ".      the two main components of the continuum emission in our sources are free - free emission from the hii region , and the warm dust from its surroundings .",
    "the predicted emission from the free - free component of the continuum flux can be calculated via equation 2.124 of @xcite .",
    "this free - free emission can then be removed from our observed 1.4 mm continuum , and we assume that the remaining continuum emission is due to thermal dust .    using the equations and relations presented in @xcite , we determined the dust masses in the regions producing the dust continuum emission .",
    "we have extrapolated the dust emissivity from @xcite as @xmath36 , where 0.125 and @xmath37 are both wavelengths in units of mm ( here , @xmath38 ) .",
    "this expression was derived without assuming that @xmath39 at 250 @xmath40 m . for our calculations ,",
    "we assume a gas to dust ratio of 100 which allows for the conversion from dust mass to gas mass .",
    "we further assume that the gas and dust temperatures are not well coupled within the hii region , since the gas temperature within the hii region is well above the dust sublimation temperature . instead",
    ", we assume that the central star is heating the dust , and the temperature falls off as @xmath41 @xcite . for the region in which the temperature is below the dust sublimation threshold , the temperature gradient",
    "was then averaged over our 1@xmath3 beam ( or , a linear size of 6400 au at the average distance to our sources ) to give an average temperature of 400 k. the masses listed in table [ tab : results ] were calculated using this single temperature and assuming @xmath42 = 1.5 .",
    "increasing @xmath42 to 2 ( while keeping the temperature at 400 k ) increases the derived masses by more than a factor of 3 .",
    "if we use the gas temperatures derived from our ch@xmath1cn the changes in the masses derived from the dust emission are within one sigma of the values listed in table [ tab : results ] .",
    "we find , in general , that the dust masses derived in this manner ( and presented in table [ tab : results ] ) are lower than the derived dynamical masses presented in section [ subsec : dynamical_mass ] .",
    "in fact , we find that the average dust derived mass is approximately half of the average dynamically derived mass .",
    "this result is expected since our calculated dust masses are for regions which are not quite as extended as the so@xmath0 emitting region and do not reflect the masses of the central star(s ) as is the case for the dynamical masses .",
    "using the spectral energy distribution fits to the continuum data presented in @xcite ( both with and without density gradients within the hii region ) we estimate the masses of the central stars powering the observed hii regions . from their continuum measurements , the ionizing flux required to maintain the hii region was determined and a minimum stellar mass inferred . if the hii region were expanding , the stellar mass required to produce the necessary ionizing flux would be higher .",
    "the required minimum stellar masses to maintain these hii regions ( assuming density gradients within the hii region ) are presented in table [ tab : results ] for all sources except w51e8 which was not included in the analysis of @xcite .",
    "as stated above , we find that the average source mass derived from the continuum emission is approximately half of the dynamically derived mass .",
    "when the stellar mass is added to the dust mass , we find that the combined mass is within approximately 1 @xmath9 of the dynamical mass for g10.6 and g28.2 . for ngc 7538 ,",
    "the combination of dust and stellar mass is much greater than the dynamical mass ; hence the estimate of 12 m@xmath10 for the dynamical mass must be an underestimate .",
    "for w51e2 , we find that the dynamically derived mass is much greater than the combined dust and stellar mass estimates , which suggests that perhaps the dust derived mass maybe underestimated .",
    "using so@xmath0 and ocs emission , we have detected rotational signatures in the warm molecular gas surrounding five hii regions .",
    "the bulk rotation of the gas inside the hii region ( as seen within w51e2 by * ? ? ? * ) and around them ( as shown here ) suggests that each of the hii regions may have formed from a single collapsing core ( i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "if these rotational motions are indicative of a smaller scale disk within each hii region , these disks may be similar to the photoevaporating disks within hypercompact hii regions described in @xcite .",
    "here we have presented two methods for determining the gas masses of the hot cores surrounding each hii region : from the molecular line emission and from the thermal component of the continuum emission .",
    "generally , the so@xmath0 emission mass is larger than the dynamical mass , however , as stated earlier , we may be over estimating the so@xmath0 abundance at the high temperatures we derive for our sources ( which are upper limits due to optical depth effects ) , and our dynamical masses are lower limits since we do not know the inclination angles of the individual sources .",
    "we find that the average of the derived warm gas masses ( so@xmath0 and ocs for a given source ) , when combined with the average minimum stellar mass required to power the hii region , are a significant fraction of the average derived dynamical masses .",
    "note that for ngc 7538 , the stellar and gas masses are much larger than the dynamical mass , suggesting the dynamical mass is underestimated for this unresolved source . that the gas and stellar masses are",
    "a large fraction of the dynamical mass in each resolved region suggests that these regions may be in rough dynamical equilibrium . while we find that most of the continuum emission in each source is due to free - free emission , it is interesting to note that the expected dust contribution to the continuum emission is the highest in w51e8 , a region we suggest to be quite young and only beginning to form its hii region . in our other four sources ,",
    "the dust emission contributes less than half of the continuum emission , while in this source it contributes at least 72% of the emission .",
    "other authors have also suggested that this region may be a mostly dusty source @xcite .",
    "ngc 7538 is the only source in this sample in which the deconvolved so@xmath0 emitting region and continuum source are not resolved by the sma beam .",
    "it is also the only source where the dynamical and gas masses are too small to be responsible for forming the massive star(s ) suggested by the stellar masses presented in table [ tab : results ] .",
    "the outer radius of the maser disk seen by @xcite in this region is @xmath2 1000 au , also smaller than our resolution element . that the emission is unresolved greatly increases the uncertainty in our mass estimates .",
    "we note that previous studies have found much higher masses for the g10.6 system ( i.e. a few hundred solar masses , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however the masses we derive here appear to be internally self consistent .",
    "in contrast , the cores in w51e appear to be much more massive than g10.6 .",
    "this may be due to the active hot cores surrounding the hii regions in these sources enhancing both the chemical abundances and radii of the sources ; each of which act to increase our mass estimates .",
    "we find the masses derived for the two regions in w51e to be quite large .",
    "the dynamical mass of w51e2 derived by @xcite is 10 m@xmath10 on size scales of 0.3@xmath3 .",
    "our value of 364 m@xmath10 within 1.2@xmath3 is consistent with their mass projected out to the size scales we observed ( @xmath43 ) , given the uncertainties in the measurements .",
    "the large masses associated with these two regions suggests that they must be forming massive clusters of stars , as has suggested to be the case for g10.6 as well ( i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "as discussed earlier , there appears to be a component of the so@xmath0 emission in the w51e8 region which may be due to outflow .",
    "that we detect outflowing gas in the warm layers surrounding the hii region suggests that the mechanism driving the outflow must be enclosed within the shell of so@xmath0 emission ; it likely originates somewhere inside the hii region .",
    "this supports the suggestion that there is ongoing accretion onto this ( these ) massive protostar(s ) .",
