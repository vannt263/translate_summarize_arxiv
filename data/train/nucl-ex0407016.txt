    "@xmath3 in has been envisaged in the lens project ( low energy neutrino spectroscopy ) as a possible target for the real - time measurement of low energy solar neutrinos .",
    "the detection principle is based on the inverse electron capture ( ec ) reaction @xmath3in(@xmath8,e@xmath9)@xmath3sn@xmath10 on @xmath3 in , which has a threshold energy of 114 kev and populates the second excited state of @xmath3sn at 613 kev ( see fig .",
    "[ levels ] later ) .",
    "this state is metastable , with a life time @xmath11 = 4.76 @xmath12s , and its subsequent two - step decay to the ground state provides an highly specific @xmath13 signature @xcite .",
    "namely , the prompt electron emitted in the inverse - ec reaction ( @xmath14 ) is followed , with a typical delay of @xmath11=4.76 @xmath12s , by a localized deposition of 116 kev ( @xmath15)@xmath16 , in spatial coincidence , and by a @xmath0-ray ( @xmath17 ) of 497 kev ( see fig . [ levels ] ) .",
    "though @xmath3 in has several favorable features as a target for low energy solar neutrinos ( high isotopic abundance , low threshold , strong @xmath13-tag ) , the detection technique is extremely challenging because @xmath3 in is unstable and can @xmath2-decay directly to the @xmath3sn ground state .",
    "the specific activity of natural indium is 0.25 bq / g and thus indium itself is the major irremovable source of background .",
    "the lens r&d project has demonstrated that the 10@xmath18 background suppression factor needed for the @xmath19 solar neutrino measurement can be achieved , however at the cost of a very high segmentation ( @xmath20 cells ) and of an one - order - of - magnitude increase of the overall detector mass @xcite .",
    "+ the most serious background that has to be faced is related to the coincidence of two spatially - close indium decays .",
    "the coincidence of two @xmath3 in decays can mimic the @xmath13-tag if the second @xmath2 has energy close to the end point and emits a hard bremsstrahlung @xmath0 .",
    "the importance of this source of background depends on the granularity of the detector ( because of the requirement of spatial coincidence ) , on the energy resolution and on the indium bremsstrahlung spectrum . in order to have a better comprehension and characterization of the bremsstrahlung ,",
    "a measurement of the @xmath0 spectrum of an indium sample was performed with hp - ge detectors in the low - level background facility underground in the gran sasso national laboratories , italy . during the analysis of the data we found evidence for a previously unknown decay of @xmath3 in to the first excited level of @xmath3sn , at the energy 497.4 kev .",
    "+ in section [ sectuno ] we describe the indium sample and the experimental details of the measurement . in section [ sectdue ]",
    "we present the spectrum and the evidence for the @xmath0 line at 497 kev . in section [ secttre ]",
    "we discuss the interpretation of this line in terms of decay of @xmath3 in to the first excited state of @xmath3sn and the consequent limit set on the @xmath3 in charge non - conserving decay .",
    "finally , in section [ sectquattro ] we summarize our results and briefly describe some possible future perspectives .",
    "the sample used for the measurement consists of an ingot of metallic @xmath21 in of mass ( 928.7@xmath10.1 ) g. it has the shape of a cylindrical shell , with the approximate dimensions of 2.0 cm ( internal diameter ) , 5.5 cm ( external diameter ) and 6.5 cm ( height ) .",
    "the high - purity indium ( 6n5 grade ) used for the production of the sample has been provided by the indium corporation of america in may 2002 .",
    "+ the @xmath0 spectrum of the indium source was measured using a set of 4 hp - ge detectors installed underground at lngs .",
    "the detectors are very similar coaxial germanium crystals mounted altogether in one cryostat made by canberra ; their main parameters are displayed in table [ detectors ] .",
    "they are arranged as shown in fig .",
    "[ setupplot ] and surround the indium sample , which is placed in the central well .",
    "the experimental setup is enclosed in a lead / copper passive shielding and has a nitrogen ventilation system against radon .",
    "+ one measurement of the indium ingot ( 2762.3 h of counting time for each detector ) and one of the background ( 1601.0 h ) were carried out , both with the complete shielding around the detectors .",
    ".germanium detectors parameters [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the detectors show a very good energy resolution and linearity . the efficiency of the configuration ( detectors and ingot ) has been evaluated using the geant4-based code jazzy , developed by o.  cremonesi . the computed full energy efficiency , i.e. the probability that a @xmath0 ray produced in a random position of the indium ingot deposits its full energy in one of the four ge detectors , is displayed in fig . [ effplot ] as a function of energy .",
    "the monte carlo code has been checked , with the procedure described in ref .",
    "@xcite , using a previous measurement performed in the same setup with a @xmath22co @xmath0 source ( 1173 kev and 1332 kev ) . taking into account the 2505 kev sum peak in the experimental spectrum and neglecting the angular correlations of the two photons , the measured absolute efficiencies in this configuration",
    "agree with the computed ones at 12@xmath23 and are consistent within their statistical uncertainities . on the basis of our previous experience with similar simulations of analogous experimental setups",
    "we estimate the systematic uncertainty on the monte carlo efficiencies to be 10% . in any case",
    ", the knowledge of the absolute efficiency at the few @xmath23 level is not needed for the present analysis , as it does not represent the main contribution to the uncertainty on the measured @xmath3 in @xmath24 @xmath3sn@xmath10 decay rate ( see sect .",
    "[ secttre ] ) .",
    "for this reason , we can conclude that our knowledge of the detector and of the absolute efficiency is satisfactory for our purposes .",
    "the spectra obtained by the four detectors for the indium sample and for the background have been added ( see fig .",
    "[ brem ] ) and analyzed using both an automatic program and visual inspection . in the indium measurement , besides the continuous component ( see fig .",
    "[ brem]a ) due to the bremsstrahlung of the electrons from the @xmath2 decay of @xmath3 in ( end point : 499 kev ) , 42 @xmath0 lines with energy above 200 kev could be identified : they are listed , together with their interpretation , in table [ gammatable ] . the same @xmath0 lines , except the one at ( 497.48@xmath10.21 )",
    "kev ( which represents the main point of this paper and will be discussed in detail in the following sections ) , are also found in the background spectrum , though some of them ( e.g. 795 , 1588 and 2447 kev ) have a poor statistical significance because of the shorter measurement time . as shown in table [ gammatable ] , the observed @xmath0 lines come from the natural radionuclides and radioactive series ( @xmath25k , @xmath26u , @xmath27u , @xmath28th ) and from cosmogenic or antropogenic nuclides ( @xmath22co , @xmath29cs , @xmath30bi , @xmath31al ) that are usually present as contaminations in normal copper and lead .",
    "the same table shows the counting rates of the @xmath0 lines for the indium sample and the background , as well as their difference ( statistical errors only ) . for each line ( except the one at 497 kev )",
    "the difference turns out to be statistically consistent with zero .",
    "hence there is no statistical evidence of radioactive contamination of the indium sample , since the data are consistent with contaminations of the experimental setup only ( germanium crystals and passive lead / copper shielding ) .",
    "+ the efficiencies quoted in table [ gammatable ] ( full energy efficiencies ) have been calculated in the hypothesis that the @xmath0 rays are generated inside the indium sample so they include the effect of self - absorption in the ingot itself .",
    "the fact that in some cases the indium - background difference rate is negative ( though statistically consistent with zero ) is explained because indium is an effective @xmath0 ray absorber ( the atomic number @xmath32 is 49 ) and can hence act as an additional shielding for the ge detectors with respect to the background measurement , where the well is filled with a plexiglas plug .      as anticipated in sect .",
    "[ spectrum_des ] , the only @xmath0 line of the indium spectrum which is not present in the background measurement and can not be ascribed to the usual radioactive contaminants is located at the energy of ( 497.48@xmath10.21 ) kev .",
    "the interesting region of the spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ lineplot ] .    from the fit of the indium spectrum in the energy region ( 487 - 508 ) kev with a gaussian peak and linear background assumption",
    ", we get a net area of ( 90@xmath122 ) counts , inconsistent with zero at more than 4@xmath33 .",
    "this corresponds to a counting rate of ( 0.78@xmath10.19 ) counts / day .",
    "variations of the energy interval for the fit result in changes of the area inside the quoted uncertainty . with the same procedure applied to the background spectrum",
    ", no gaussian peak could be found and the resulting area is ( 0@xmath114 ) counts ; the corresponding upper limit derived with the feldman - cousins method @xcite is 23.0 counts ( 90@xmath23 cl ) or 0.34 counts / day ( 90@xmath23 cl ) . + it can hence be concluded that the peak under examination is statistically significant and related with the indium sample , being absent in the background measurement .",
    "the peak with the energy ( 497.48@xmath10.21 ) kev found in the indium measurement and absent in the background one can be explained with the @xmath2 decay of @xmath3 in to the first excited level of @xmath3sn , whose excitation energy is 497.4 kev .",
    "such a process has never been observed previously and the @xmath2 decay of @xmath3 in was considered up - to - date as going exclusively to the ground state of @xmath3sn @xcite . because of the large change in the nuclear angular momentum ( @xmath34 ) , the ground state to ground state @xmath2 decay of @xmath3 in is a 4@xmath35 forbidden transition and has one of the largest known @xmath36 values ( @xmath37 22.5 ) .",
    "the measured half life of @xmath3 in is @xmath38 y @xcite .",
    "+ according to the most recent table of atomic masses @xcite , the mass difference between @xmath3 in and @xmath3sn is ( 499@xmath14 ) kev .",
    "the decay @xmath3 in @xmath39sn@xmath10 to the first excited level of @xmath3sn is hence kinematically allowed , though with an extremely small @xmath5 value , kev .",
    "+ using the area of the 497 kev peak observed in the indium spectrum , the decay rate for the transition to the first excited level of @xmath3sn can be evaluated through the relation @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the efficiency to detect the full energy @xmath0 with the 4 ge detectors , @xmath42 is the number of @xmath3 in nuclei in the sample , @xmath43 is the measurement time , @xmath44 is the area of the peak and @xmath45 is the coefficient of conversion of @xmath0 quanta to electrons for the given nuclear transition . + the full peak efficiency at 497 kev is @xmath41 = ( 3.32@xmath10.33)% and it was evaluated using the monte carlo simulation described in sect .",

    "the area of the peak is ( 90@xmath122 ) counts ( see sect .",
    "[ luciano ] ) and the electron conversion coefficient for the transition is @xmath45=8.1@xmath49 @xcite . with these values and @xmath43=2762.3 h ,",
    "the decay rate for the @xmath3 in @xmath2 decay to the first excited level of @xmath3sn is estimated to be @xmath50 that corresponds to a partial half life of @xmath51 the probability of this process is thus near one million times lower than for the transition to the ground state of @xmath3sn ( see fig .",
    "[ levels ] ) ; the experimental branching ratio is @xmath52 the uncertainty on the decay rate and on the branching ratio mainly comes from the statistical error on the net area of the 497 kev peak .    nuclear spin and parity are changed in the observed transition from the initial @xmath53 of the @xmath3 in ground state to @xmath54 of @xmath3sn@xmath55 ; this is therefore a 2@xmath56 forbidden unique @xmath2 decay .",
    "the recommended value of @xmath36 for such a decay is equal to ( 11.7@xmath10.9 ) @xcite . with the measured value of the half life of @xmath57 y",
    ", the `` experimental '' @xmath58 value can be calculated as @xmath59 . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath58 value can be estimated using the formalism described in @xcite : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the value for the allowed transition and @xmath62 is the correction for the 2@xmath56 forbidden unique decay .",

    "the value of @xmath58 for @xmath70 kev calculated with the logft code is however very different from the previous estimation : @xmath72 ; this means that with such a @xmath73 the beta decay should go near 6 orders of magnitude faster .",
    "one can solve the inverse problem and use the logft code to adjust the @xmath73 value corresponding to the measured @xmath59 .",
    "such a procedure gives an extremely low value of @xmath74 ev .",
    "+ while both these calculations can be considered as very tentative and not being intended to be used for such low energies , the last estimation gives a hint that the @xmath73 value in the beta decay @xmath3 in @xmath24 @xmath3sn@xmath55 can be very close to zero evaluation for @xmath3 in gives some indication for this : the @xmath73 value was slightly lower than energy of the first excited 497.4 kev @xmath3sn state in accordance with older tables of atomic masses , @xmath75 kev @xcite and ( @xmath76 ) kev @xcite , while it is slightly higher in the last evaluation , ( @xmath77 ) kev @xcite .",
    "such a unique situation could be used to establish a limit on the antineutrino mass , in addition to the experiments with @xmath78h and @xmath79re , where up - to - date limits are in the range of @xmath80 2 ev @xcite and @xmath80 15 ev @xcite , respectively . to do this in a competitive way both the @xmath3 in @xmath73-value and",
    "the energy of the @xmath3sn 497.4 kev level should be measured with an accuracy of @xmath811 ev or better .",
    "the uncertainty in the energy of the 497.4 kev level is equal now to 22 ev @xcite and it could be further reduced doing an accurate investigation of the @xmath3sb decay lines of calibration sources are known with an accuracy of @xmath82 ev , also in the @xmath81500 kev region of our interest @xcite . ] . the atomic mass difference @xmath3 in  @xmath3sn can possibly also be measured with an accuracy of @xmath811 ev .",

    "@xmath83se was determined with 50 ev uncertainty in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was stated that the penning traps technique is able to deliver even more accurate results .",
    "both such measurements require strong experimental efforts but the physical result could be very interesting and important .      in some nuclear processes @xmath0 rays with energies close to 497 kev",
    "are emitted .",
    "this could give an alternative explanation of the peak observed in the experimental spectrum .",
    "luckily , additional @xmath0 rays are also emitted in such decays , allowing to tag those mimicking effects .",
    "+ the @xmath3 in nucleus has an isomeric state @xmath84 in with the energy @xmath85 = 336.2 kev and a half life of 4.5 h @xcite . with the probability of 0.047% the @xmath84 in nucleus @xmath2-decays to the first excited level of @xmath3sn , with the subsequent emission of a 497 kev @xmath0 ray @xcite .",
    "however , in this case a @xmath0 ray with the energy @xmath85 = 336.2 kev is emitted with much higher probability ( 45.84@xmath23 @xcite ) because of the electromagnetic transition from the isomeric @xmath84 in to the ground @xmath3 in state .",
    "this huge peak at 336.2 kev , whose area should be @xmath81 10@xmath78 times bigger than that of the observed 497.4 kev peak , is absent in the experimental spectrum ; only a peak at 338.3 kev is observed , with the net area of ( 138@xmath150 ) counts , which corresponds to the decay of @xmath86ac from the @xmath28th natural chain ( see table [ gammatable ] ) .",
    "therefore the decay of the isomeric state @xmath84 in is absolutely negligible and the 497 kev peak can not be ascribed to it , not even in part .",
    "similarly , given also the underground location of the experimental setup and the low flux of neutrons @xcite , we conclude that @xmath87 reactions can not contribute to the peak under analysis .",
    "+ protons produced by fast neutron or cosmic ray muons can populate the second excited level of @xmath3sn ( fig .",
    "[ levels ] ) via the @xmath88 reaction on @xmath3 in ( @xmath89=0.9 mev ) ; the @xmath3sn nucleus quickly returns to the ground state with the emission of two @xmath0 rays of energy 115.4 and 497.4 kev .",
    "the contribution originated by fast neutrons is practically zero ( see f.i .",
    "@xcite ) because of the deep underground location and the lack of hydrogenous materials in the setup . on the other hand , since the muon flux in the laboratory is extremely low ( 1 @xmath12/m@xmath90h @xcite ) , also the contribution of @xmath88 reactions induced by cosmic rays ( see also @xcite ) to the 497 kev peak is absolutely negligible ( @xmath91 10@xmath92 counts ) .",
    "+ some decays from the natural @xmath26u and @xmath28th chains can also give @xmath0 rays in the energy region of interest , though with very low intensity .",
    "they are in particular @xcite @xmath93bi ( @xmath94 = 496.7 kev , @xmath95 = 0.0069% ) , @xmath86ac ( @xmath94 = 497.5 kev , @xmath95 = 0.0059% ) and @xmath96pa ( @xmath94 = 498.0 kev , @xmath95 = 0.062% ) .",
    "however , the sum contribution of these decays to the 497 kev peak is less than 1 count and can be easily estimated using their stronger associated @xmath0 lines.ac , whose relative intensity is 11.27% , is only ( 138@xmath150 ) counts .",
    "therefore , if the contamination were located in the indium ingot , the estimated contribution to the 497 kev peak , taking also into account the different full peak efficiency , would be ( 7.3@xmath12.6)@xmath4610@xmath97 counts . ] + we could not figure out other sources than can mimic the experimentally observed 497 kev peak .",
    "the present measurements give also the possibility to set a limit on the charge non - conserving ( cnc ) @xmath2 decay of @xmath3 in , a process in which the @xmath98 transformation is not accompanied by the emission of an electron @xcite .",
    "it is supposed that instead of an @xmath99 , a massless particle is emitted ( for example a @xmath100 , a @xmath0 quantum , or a majoron ) : @xmath101 or @xmath0 or m ) + @xmath102 .",
    "up - to - date , the cnc @xmath2 decay was searched for with four nuclides only : @xmath103ga , @xmath104ge , @xmath105rb and @xmath106cd .",

    "if the whole area of the observed 497 kev peak is considered as belonging to the cnc beta decay ( instead of the much less exotic usual @xmath2-decay of @xmath3 in ) , and substituting in the formula for the life time @xmath109 $ ] the values of efficiency and other parameters described in section [ betaexc ] together with @xmath110 , the feldman - cousins 90% cl limit on the life time of this process is @xmath111 though this value is relatively low , it is determined for the first time for @xmath3 in , expanding the scarce information on the cnc processes .",
