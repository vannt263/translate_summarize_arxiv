    "the three - point correlation function ( 3pcf ) , or its fourier transform , the bispectrum , is a valuable complement to two - point statistics in characterizing galaxy clustering .",
    "the behavior of the 3pcf of the matter is well understood in perturbation theory ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for gaussian initial conditions ,",
    "second - order perturbation theory predicts that the amplitude of the 3pcf @xmath0}}$ ] scales like the square of the amplitude of the two - point correlation function ( 2pcf ) @xmath1 ( @xcite ) , and this scaling is one of the fundamental tests of the gaussian primordial fluctuations predicted by inflationary cosmology .",
    "nonlinear gravitational evolution produces anisotropic , filamentary structures , so elongated triangle configurations have higher amplitude in the three - point statistics .",
    "galaxy bias , a difference between the distributions of galaxies and matter , can alter three - point statistics , but it tends to boost or suppress amplitudes for all triangle configurations equally , at least on large scales .",
    "the triangle shape dependence of the 3pcf or bispectrum , in combination with the 2pcf or power spectrum , therefore becomes a diagnostic for galaxy bias and the matter clustering amplitude ( @xcite ) .",
    "early measurements of the 3pcf or bispectrum were based on angular catalogs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "galaxy redshift surveys like the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; @xcite ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) , are now large enough to allow measurements of the redshift - space 3pcf or bispectrum with high signal - to - noise ratio ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , this brings in the additional complication of distortion by the peculiar motions of galaxies . even for the 2pcf or power spectrum ,",
    "the effect of nonlinear redshift - space distortions persist to remarkably large scales ( @xcite ) .",
    "distortions of the 3pcf or bispectrum are more complex , and while some models of these distortions exist ( e.g. , @xcite ) , it is not clear that they are accurate at the level of precision afforded by current data .",
    "an obvious way to circumvent redshift - space distortions is to project the 3pcf over the redshift direction , as is commonly done for the projected 2pcf @xmath2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we note that projection of redshift surveys is _ not _ the same as simply measuring from the parent angular catalog  the use of galaxy redshifts to obtain physical projected separations greatly reduces the noise and yields a quantity more closely related to the three - dimensional 3pcf .",
    "projected 3pcfs have been measured for the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs ) by @xcite and for the 2dfgrs ( @xcite ) on relatively small scales . by comparing the measurements with the predicted 3pcfs of matter in @xmath3-body simulations",
    ", they find that the observed galaxy 3pcfs are lower than the predicted matter 3pcfs , indicating the need of galaxy bias to explain the data .",
    "since the three - dimensional 3pcf is already a complicated object , projection may seem to forgo any chance of analytic treatment .",
    "however , i show here that the relation of the projected 3pcf to the ( three - dimensional ) bispectrum is relatively straightforward if the bispectrum is decomposed into fourier moments (   2 ) . my analysis is directly analogous to that of @xcite , who introduces multipole expansion of the three - dimensional 3pcf and bispectrum and",
    "shows it to be useful in simplifying the relation between them , in characterizing the triangle configuration dependence , and in constraining galaxy bias .",
    "the spirit of this paper parallels that of @xcite . in   3",
    "i show that bias effects remain simple for projected 2pcfs and 3pcfs on large scales , which makes it attractive to constrain galaxy bias using projected quantities .",
    "i briefly summarize my results in   4 .",
    "before going into details , i emphasize that the meaning of projection in this paper has subtle differences from the usual angular correlation . our goal is to describe the projection of the measured redshift - space correlation functions from a galaxy redshift survey and to use it to study problems like galaxy bias .",
    "since galaxies with different properties cluster differently ( e.g. , red galaxies are in general more strongly clustered than blue galaxies ) , it is desirable to construct volume - limited samples that uniformly represent galaxies of a given type . by doing so , we can infer bias information as a function of galaxy type , rather than some average over all types of galaxies ( weighted in a complicated way ) like that from flux - limited galaxy samples .",
    "this approach helps the understanding of galaxy bias and aids comparisons with theoretical structure formation models .",
    "redshift - space correlation functions can be measured by comparing the galaxy distribution with a distribution of random points that has the same geometry and selection function as the galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the projected correlation function can be formed by integrating the redshift - space correlation function along the redshift direction .",
    "the selection function does not enter the integration because its effect is included in the error budget of the measured redshift - space correlation function .",
    "in contrast , one needs to take into account the selection function in modeling angular correlation measurements of galaxy clustering .",
    "nevertheless , our results in this paper can be easily generalized to include selection function to model angular clustering ( see the discussion in   3 and @xcite ) .",
    "since redshift - space distortions conserve numbers of pairs and triplets , 2pcfs and 3pcfs projected from real - space three - dimensional correlation functions are identical to those from redshift - space three - dimensional correlation functions .",
    "this vastly simplifies theoretical predictions of projected 2pcfs and 3pcfs  we only need to project the real - space three - dimensional correlation functions , without calculating redshift - space distortions . in practice ,",
    "the radial extent of the projection may not be infinite , but it should be large enough to minimize any residual redshift - space distortions .",
    "we generally assume ideal infinite projections and plane - parallel geometry ( the distant observer approximation ) in our derivation .",
    "we start by reviewing the calculation of the projected 2pcf and its relation to the fluctuation power spectrum .",
    "the ( three - dimensional ) 2pcf @xmath4 is the fourier transform of the fluctuation power spectrum @xmath5 , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the pair separation .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : xi ] ) holds for real - space quantities , which are isotropic , or for redshift - space quantities , which are not .",
    "both @xmath7 and @xmath8 can be decomposed into components perpendicular and parallel to the line of sight : @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the projected 2pcf is obtained by integrating @xmath4 along the line of sight , @xmath11 after substituting equation  ( [ eqn : xi ] ) into equation  ( [ eqn : wp ] ) and putting variables into the form of perpendicular and parallel components , we have @xmath12 equation  ( [ eqn : wp_b ] ) follows from equation  ( [ eqn : wp_a ] ) because the rightmost integral in equation  ( [ eqn : wp_a ] ) is just @xmath13 times the dirac @xmath14-function @xmath15 .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : wp_b ] ) states that the projected 2pcf is the two - dimensional fourier transform of the power spectrum , and because we have projected out redshift - space distortions , we can use the isotropic , real - space @xmath16 in the integral .",
    "we can evaluate equation  ( [ eqn : wp_b ] ) in polar coordinates .",
    "the angular part can be calculated by using the expansion @xmath17 $ ] ( plane waves in terms of cylindrical waves ) , where @xmath18 is the angle between @xmath8 and @xmath7 and @xmath19 is the bessel function of integer order .",
    "finally , equation  ( [ eqn : wp_b ] ) reduces to a one - dimensional integral , @xmath20 this equation mimics the relation for the real - space , three - dimensional 2pcf which involves the spherical bessel function @xmath21 .",
    "this kind of result can be found in papers that deal with projected observations , such as variants of limber s equation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the projected 3pcfs can be derived in a similar way to the 2pcfs .",

    "we adopt the notation that a subscript of one number represents one side for a wavevector triangle , while it represents one vertex for a real - space triangle .",
    "each side of a real - space triangle is denoted by subscript of two numbers , e.g. , @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : xithree_a ] ) reduces to @xmath27}}({{\\bf r}}_1,{{\\bf r}}_2,{{\\bf r}}_3 )   = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^6 } \\int d^3{{\\bf k}}_1 d^3{{\\bf k}}_2 b({{\\bf k}}_1,{{\\bf k}}_2 )     e^{i({{\\bf k}}_1 { { \\bf \\cdot}}{{\\bf r}}_{13 } + { { \\bf k}}_2 { { \\bf \\cdot}}{{\\bf r}}_{23})},\\ ] ] where @xmath28 does not appear explicitly in the bispectrum because the wavevector triangle is fully determined by @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) .",

    "one vertex ( e.g. , @xmath33 ) can be fixed .",

    "equation  ( [ eqn : wpthreeft ] ) is a four - dimensional integral , and it is clearly desirable to simplify the calculation , by reducing its dimensionality . note that @xmath36 is just the usual three - dimensional , real - space bispectrum evaluated at @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "@xcite introduces multipole expansion of the three - dimensional three - point statistics and shows that the 3pcf can then be put in a simple form ( see also @xcite for a similar expansion in the bispectrum ) .",
    "consequently , the whole calculation becomes simple because only a few multipoles are needed for accurate convergence . in the same spirit as @xcite , we introduce fourier expansion of the projected three - point statistics .",
    "the bispectrum can be expanded as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the angle between @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and the coefficient @xmath42 can be obtained through @xmath43 we have used the fact that the bispectrum has the symmetry @xmath44 , so @xmath45 and the expansion is a cosine fourier expansion .",
    "we rewrite equation  ( [ eqn : wpthreeft ] ) in polar variables , replace @xmath46 with its fourier expansion , and expand the two exponentials in the same way as we do in deriving equation  ( [ eqn : wpft ] ) ( it is useful to write the angle between two vectors as the difference of their polar angles ) . after integrating the angular part using the orthogonality of @xmath47 , we find that @xmath48}}(r_{p13},r_{p23},\\phi ) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{+\\infty } { w_{p , n}^{[3]}}(r_{p13},r_{p23 } ) e^{in\\phi},\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the angle between @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and the fourier coefficient @xmath52}}(r_{p13},r_{p23 } ) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty } \\frac{k_1}{2\\pi } dk_1    \\int_{0}^{\\infty } \\frac{k_2}{2\\pi } dk_2\\ ,   ( -1)^n b_n(k_1,k_2 ) j_n(k_1 r_{p13})j_n(k_2 r_{p23}).\\ ] ] equation  ( [ eqn : wpthreen ] ) is in a form that resembles the projected 2pcf in equation  ( [ eqn : wpft ] ) .",
    "the essence here is that , by fourier expansion of the bispectrum @xmath46 and cylindrical wave expansion of the plane wave @xmath53 , the angular dependence is separated and integrated .",
    "there are also similarities between the above equation and equation ( 3 ) in @xcite for the multipole coefficient of the three - dimensional 3pcf .",
    "we see that the calculation of the projected 3pcf from a given three - dimensional bispectrum requires essentially the same amount of work as the three - dimensional 3pcf ( and a similar remark holds for 2pcf and the three - dimensional power spectrum ) . for 3pcfs ,",
    "what we need to calculate are expansion coefficients , where only one - dimensional ( for expansion coefficients of the bispectrum ) and two - dimensional ( for coefficients of the correlation function ) integrals are involved .",
    "i note that the same result ( equation  [ [ eqn : wpthreen ] ] ) is also obtained independently by i. szapudi ( 2004 , private communication ) .",
    "if the effect of finite projection has to be taken into account , the dirac @xmath14-function we use to derive equations  ( [ eqn : wp_b ] ) and ( [ eqn : wpthreeft ] ) is replaced by @xmath54 , if the projection is performed for line - of - sight separations from @xmath55 to @xmath56 .",
    "equations  ( [ eqn : wp_b ] ) and ( [ eqn : wpthreeft ] ) become three- and six - dimensional integrals , respectively .",
    "the fourier expansion can still be adopted to reduce the calculation of the projected 3pcf to four - dimensional integrals .    as an example of the advantage of the fourier expansion",
    ", figure  1 shows the first few fourier expansion coefficients of the matter bispectrum for @xmath57 and the bispectrum recovered from using fourier components up to @xmath58 5 , and 10 in the weakly nonlinear regime .",
    "the matter bispectrum in this regime can be written in the following form ( e.g. , @xcite ) , @xmath59p(k_1)p(k_2 )                       + { \\rm perm.},\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the linear matter power spectrum and @xmath60 reflects the weak dependence on cosmology ( @xmath61 for a spatially flat universe ; @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "the first term has fourier components only up to @xmath62 .",
    "the other permutations have higher frequency components because @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 are all functions of @xmath66 .",
    "the results in figure  1 are analogous to those of @xcite , where the bispectrum is viewed as contributions by multipoles .",
    "in fact , the @xmath67th - order legendre polynomial has fourier components up to @xmath67 . in figure  1",
    "we have adopted a linear power spectrum in the parameterization of @xcite with a primordial fluctuation power - law index @xmath68 and a shape parameter @xmath69 .",
    "we see that only a few , low - frequency fourier components are significant . for example , truncating the fourier series up to @xmath70 can recover the bispectrum with a fractional error of @xmath711% for @xmath57 . in the weakly nonlinear regime , the galaxy bispectrum can be obtained by a linear combination of the matter bispectrum and the quantity @xmath72 with combination coefficients depending on galaxy bias ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in modeling galaxy 3pcfs , it is useful to expand this quantity in fourier series , too .",
    "again , the first few fourier coefficients are enough .",
    "the reduced 3pcf in real space is defined as @xmath73}}({{\\bf r}}_1,{{\\bf r}}_2,{{\\bf r}}_3 ) } { \\xi(r_{12})\\xi(r_{23})+\\xi(r_{23})\\xi(r_{31})+\\xi(r_{31})\\xi(r_{12})}.\\ ] ] for galaxies , this quantity has contributions from both gravity and galaxy bias ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for gaussian initial conditions , in the weakly nonlinear regime , if the local galaxy overdensity @xmath74 is expanded in terms of the local matter overdensity @xmath75 as @xmath76 ( local bias model ) , the reduced 3pcfs of galaxies and matter have the relation @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the linear galaxy bias factor and @xmath79 is the lowest - order nonlinear bias factor . in redshift space , the 3pcf of galaxies , which is easy to measure ,",
    "differs from the real - space one because of the additional contribution from peculiar motions of galaxies , and the above relation no longer holds .",
    "constraints on galaxy bias from observations in redshift space therefore require accurate modeling of the peculiar motion of galaxies .",
    "since projection along the line of sight essentially eliminates the effect of redshift - space distortions , it is interesting to see whether we can infer @xmath80 and @xmath79 using measurements of projected quantities .    at first glance",
    ", it seems impossible to directly perform projections on both sides of equation  ( [ eqn : qbias ] ) , since the @xmath81 term leads to divergence .",
    "furthermore , the projection of @xmath82 from redshift space is not , in general , the same as from real space .",
    "we therefore project the 2pcfs and 3pcfs themselves , before taking ratios .",
    "to do so , we substitute the definition of @xmath82 ( equation  [ [ eqn : qdef ] ] ) into equation  ( [ eqn : qbias ] ) and multiply both sides by [ @xmath83 . on large scales , by using the relation @xmath84 , we find @xmath85}}_g({{\\bf r}}_1,{{\\bf r}}_2,{{\\bf r}}_3)=b^3{\\xi^{[3]}}_m({{\\bf r}}_1,{{\\bf r}}_2,{{\\bf r}}_3 )       + \\frac{b_2}{b^2}\\left[\\xi_g(r_{12})\\xi_g(r_{23 } )       + \\xi_g(r_{23})\\xi_g(r_{31})+\\xi_g(r_{31})\\xi_g(r_{12})\\right].\\ ] ] now we can perform projection on both sides by fixing @xmath33 , as we do in equation  ( [ eqn : xithreeproj ] ) . after the projection , @xmath0}}$ ] becomes @xmath86}}$ ] and it is easy to show that the product @xmath87 becomes @xmath88 .",
    "we then divide both sides by [ @xmath89 and use the linear bias relation @xmath90 on large scales .",
    "the result is just equation  ( [ eqn : qbias ] ) in terms of the reduced projected 3pcf @xmath91 , where @xmath91 is formed as @xmath92}}({{\\bf r}}_{p1},{{\\bf r}}_{p2},{{\\bf r}}_{p3 } ) } { w_p(r_{p12})w_p(r_{p23})+w_p(r_{p23})w_p(r_{p31})+w_p(r_{p31})w_p(r_{p12})}.\\ ] ] so the relation between galaxy and matter reduced 3pcfs in equation  ( [ eqn : qbias ] ) still holds , @xmath93 if the reduced projected 3pcf is properly defined .",
    "this kind of definition is also adopted by @xcite , who point out that if @xmath82 is a constant ( which in general it is not ) then @xmath91 is also a constant and equal to @xmath82 .",
    "@xcite also measure the reduced projected 3pcf as a function of triangle shape for galaxies in the lcrs and the 2dfgrs .",
    "based on the above results , it is straightforward to infer bias from projected quantities . by projecting the measured redshift - space @xmath1 and @xmath0}}$ ] , we form @xmath94 for projected triangles that have two sides ( @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) fixed but differ in the angle @xmath49 between them .",
    "the dark matter @xmath97 can be computed using the method introduced in   2 ( for projecting @xmath1 and @xmath0}}$ ] ) or can be measured from cosmological @xmath3-body simulations .",
    "the reduced 3pcfs @xmath98 and @xmath99 can be expanded in either fourier or multipole series , whichever one prefers .",
    "their expansion coefficients satisfy @xmath100 , where @xmath101 for @xmath102 , and 0 otherwise .",
    "the nonlinear bias factor only enters in the @xmath102 component ( i.e. , the dc component for fourier expansion or the monopole for multipole expansion ) .",
    "the relation between coefficients of other components provide useful tests of bias models and perturbation theory ( see   4 of @xcite for a more detailed discussion , which also applies here ) .",
    "alternatively , we can infer @xmath80 and @xmath79 from a two - parameter fit to @xmath98 , which is widely used ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in order to make meaningful comparisons with predictions in the weakly nonlinear regime , all quantities",
    "should be measured on large scales .",
    "if the two sides ( @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) of the projected triangle are large ( e.g. , greater than 10@xmath103 ) and differ substantially ( e.g. , @xmath104 ) , then the condition is guaranteed because any deprojected triangle lies in the weakly nonlinear regime ( e.g. , @xmath105 ) . for configurations with @xmath106 ( but still large ) ,",
    "the strongly nonlinear regime affects the value of @xmath91 at @xmath107 , where @xmath108 approaches the size of the largest halos .",
    "even for this extreme case , we can fit @xmath94 by rejecting data points near @xmath109 .",
    "since the strong nonlinear effect tends to add high - frequency components or higher order multipoles to @xmath91 , it is unlikely for it to have a large impact on bias parameters estimated from fourier coefficients or multipole coefficients .",
    "the use of projected triangles with different values of @xmath95 and @xmath96 would lead to a consistency check of the inferred bias factors and increase the signal - to - noise ratio .    as an illustration",
    ", we fit the projected 3pcfs measured by @xcite for galaxies in the 2dfgrs . @xcite",

    "they also have predictions of reduced projected 3pcfs of the matter for the concordance cosmological model , which are measured in an @xmath3-body simulation . in their figures  17 and 18 , they compare the observed @xmath94 and the predicted @xmath97 for different triangle shapes , which provide the information we need to do the two - parameter fit .",
    "a different parameterization is adopted by @xcite to characterize a triangle , one parameter ( @xmath112 , the length of the shortest side ) for the size and two parameters ( @xmath113 and @xmath114 ) for the shape , with the lengths of the three sides being @xmath112 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 . in their figures , the 3pcfs are plotted as a function of @xmath114 ( five equal linear bins in the range @xmath117 ) for several combinations of @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "for the two - parameter fit , we choose the case with the largest value of @xmath112 they have , i.e. , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 .",
    "if the @xmath114 dependence is translated into an angular dependence , the five data points only cover @xmath49 from @xmath120 to @xmath121 , with the widths of the five angular bins being @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 .",
    "we see that the last bin smears the angular dependence a lot .",
    "so when measuring the 3pcfs from galaxy clustering data , adopting the @xmath127 parameterization and dividing @xmath49 into narrow bins are probably more suitable to probe the angular dependence than the @xmath128 parameterization .",
    "since the errorbars on the measurements are large and the scales are not truly in the weakly nonlinear regime , we can not obtain robust constraints on galaxy bias parameters .",
    "nevertheless , application of the formalism gives bias factors for galaxies in the bright ( faint ) sample that are consistent with @xmath129 and @xmath130 ( @xmath131 and @xmath130 ) , somewhat higher @xmath80 than expected but not absurdly so .",
    "if the projection is not infinite , the kind of relation shown in equation  ( [ eqn : qbias ] ) also holds as long as we use the finite projected correlation functions in the definition of @xmath91 ( equation  [ [ eqn : qpdef ] ] ) . strictly speaking , in this case",

    "our point here is that once the reduced 3pcf of the matter is calculated by taking account of the selection function , galaxy bias factors can be correctly inferred by comparing it with the observed reduced projected 3pcfs of galaxies .",

    "the linear bias factor @xmath80 and the first - order nonlinear bias factor @xmath79 thus can be inferred from the reduced projected 3pcfs of galaxies ( @xmath94 ) formed from redshift - space measurements , through the dependence of @xmath94 on the angle between two sides of projected triangles . from the point of view of fourier expansion , the nonlinear bias factor only affects the dc component of @xmath91 , and the linear bias factor is given by the ratio of coefficients of other fourier components of @xmath94 and @xmath97 .",
    "the method of measuring galaxy bias factors from projected 3pcfs can be directly applied to the data from contemporary galaxy redshift surveys ( e.g. , 2dfgrs and sdss ) .",
    "the projected 3pcfs of galaxies should be measured on large scales , i.e. , in the weakly nonlinear regime , where the bias relation ( equation  [ [ eqn : qbiasp ] ] ) predicted by the local bias model applies .",
    "the projected 3pcfs of matter can be calculated using the technique introduced in   2 , or they can be measured from cosmological @xmath3-body simulations .",
    "the inferred bias factors of galaxies would help to constrain cosmological parameters , such as the amplitude of the matter fluctuation power spectrum .",
    "theoretically , the framework of the halo occupation distribution is often adopted to model galaxy clustering by linking galaxies to dark matter halos ( for the three - dimensional 3pcf modeling within this framework , see , e.g. , @xcite ) . with the help of this framework , even in the strongly non - linear regime , galaxy clustering would bring in additional constraining powers on cosmological parameters as well as on the relation between galaxies and matter .",
    "in any regime , projected 3pcfs , little affected by redshift - space distortions , are useful statistics .",
    "on very small scales where the three galaxies of each triplet come from the same dark matter halo , 3pcfs probe the shape of halos and the relative distribution of galaxies and matter inside halos .",
    "the projected 3pcf in this regime can be obtained by projecting the real - space 3pcf , which is easy to calculate ( @xcite ) . on intermediate or large scales where the galaxies of each triplet are from two or three different halos ,",
    "the calculation of the 3pcf is simpler in fourier space than in real space .",
    "fourier expansion would be a useful technique to calculate the projected correlation functions on these scales .",
