    "traversable wormholes are throat like geometrical structures which connect two separate and distinct regions of spacetimes and have no horizon or singularity @xcite .",
    "it is known that the traversable wormholes in einstein gravity possess a stress - energy tensor that violates the standard energy conditions and therefore they are supported by exotic matter ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there are two main areas in wormhole research which attracted many authors .",
    "the first one is to try avoiding , as much as possible , the violation of the standard energy conditions .",
    "the existence of traversable wormholes that are supported by arbitrarily small quantities of exotic matter @xcite or supported by matter not violating the energy conditions @xcite have been investigated .",
    "one of the most interesting kinds of traversable wormholes is the thin - shell wormholes which are constructed by the cut - and - paste technique used for the first time in relation to wormholes in refs .",
    "this is due to the fact that energy is concentrated on the throat of thin - shell wormholes , and therefore the construction of these wormholes needs less exotic matter .",
    "thin - shell wormholes have been investigated by many authors @xcite .",
    "the second main research area is the stability analysis of thin - shell wormholes against a symmetry preserving perturbation .",
    "this can be done by considering a linearized stability analysis around the static wormhole solutions .",
    "the stability analysis will tell whether a static wormhole solution holds under small perturbations or not .",
    "the stability analysis of four - dimensional thin - shell wormholes of einstein gravity with spherical symmetry in vacuum has been done in @xcite and in the presence of cosmological constant in @xcite .",
    "the generalization of these stability analysis to the case of higher - dimensional wormholes can be found in @xcite . also for stability analysis with dilaton , axion , phantom and other types of matter , and in cylindrical symmetry",
    "see @xcite .    for thin - shell wormholes of einstein gravity ,",
    "the weak energy condition ( wec ) is violated .",
    "several attempts have been made to somehow overcome this problem .",

    ", the thin - shell wormholes of dilaton gravity supported by chaplygin gas have been investigated in @xcite , of brans - dicke theory in @xcite and of gauss - bonnet gravity in @xcite .",
    "recently , the third order lovelock gravity have attracted more attention @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that it contains more free parameters , and therefore third order lovelock gravity may be dual to a more extended class of field theories which one can study with holography @xcite .",
    "here , we like to add the third order term of lovelock theory @xcite to the gravitational field equations , and investigate the effects of it on the energy conditions and stability of a thin - shell wormhole solution .    in order to do these",
    ", one needs the generalized junction conditions in lovelock gravity .",
    "the junction conditions in einstein gravity is known as darmois - israel junction conditions @xcite .",
    "also the generalized junction conditions in gauss - bonnet gravity @xcite and lovelock gravity @xcite have been introduced . in this paper",
    ", we use the generalized junction conditions in order to investigate the exoticity of matter on the throat and to perform a linear stability analysis of the thin - shell wormholes of lovelock gravity .",
