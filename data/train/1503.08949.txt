    "in the last years there has been an increasing interest in studying the galactic bulge resulting from the accumulation of more spectroscopic data . in particular , from these data a rather complex picture for the bulge formation arose : the existence of at least two main stellar populations in the bulge was suggested by several studies ( babusiaux et al . 2011 ; gonzalez et al .",
    "2011 ; hill et al . 2011 ; bensby et al .",
    "2011 , robin et al .",
    "2012 , uttenthaler et al . 2012 ; bensby et al . 2013 ) .",
    "the two populations arising from the spectroscopic data are characterized by a metal - poor one , with characteristics typical of stars belonging to a spheroid , and another one more metal - rich and with characteristics of bar kinematics .",
    "also the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios of these two populations seem different in the sense that the metal rich population shows lower [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios ( hill et al .",
    "grieco et al .",
    "( 2012 , hereafter gmpc12 ) tried to model these two populations and concluded that the metal - poor population formed on a very short timescale by means of an intense burst of star formation , whose efficiency was a factor of 20 higher than in the galactic thin disk .",
    "the more metal - rich population instead should have formed on a longer timescale and with lower star formation efficiency and it was created by the bar evolution . while in the gmpc12 model the bulge was treated as a unique single zone with radius of 2kpc , here we present a model for the central region of the bulge , the galactic center ( gc ) . in particular we will focus on a region of 200 pc radius .",
    "the gc region has an extremely rich environment : intense star formation with formation of a bulk of massive stars and three of the most massive young star clusters in the galaxy . in the last years",
    "many assumptions have been made about the nature of the inner population and on the possible causes of the star formation activity in the last few hundreds myr .",
    "genzel et al .",
    "( 2006 ) pointed out that most of the stars in the gc seem to have formed @xmath4 @xmath3 ago , probably at the same time as the galactic bulge .",
    "then the star formation rate ( sfr ) dropped to a minimum a few @xmath3 ago rising again in the past few million years .",
    "the star formation history was derived in the gc from the h - r diagram of the red giants ( pfhul et al .",
    "2011 ) , while the present time sfr was derived from the infrared luminosity of the young massive stars forming in the large reservoir of molecular gas present in the gc ( yusef - zadeh et al . 2009 ) or by counting these young massive stars ( immer et al .",
    "one important issue relevant to the nature of the stellar populations in the gc is the possible presence of a second bar .",
    "however , the presence of a double bar in our galaxy , similar to what can be observed in external galaxies ( laine et al . 2002 ; erwin 2004 ) is still under debate . alard ( 2001 ) , nishiyama et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and gonzalez et al .",
    "( 2011 ) claim that there is an inner structure distinct from the large - scale galactic bar , with a different orientation angle which could be associated with a secondary , inner bar . on the other hand",
    ", gerhard & martinez - valpuesta ( 2012 ) can explain this inner structure by dynamical instabilities from the disk without requiring a nuclear bar .",
    "very recently , ryde & schultheis ( 2015 ) have measured , from high resolution infrared spectroscopy , abundances of mg , si , ca and fe in 9 m - type giants in the gc region . they found a metal - rich population at [ fe / h]=+0.11@xmath50.15 dex with rather low [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios with the possible exception of ca . their metallicity distribution function ( mdf )",
    "is peaked at a [ fe / h ] slightly higher than solar and agrees with previous data of cunha et al .",
    "cunha et al . (",
    "2007 ) had also measured high resolution infrared spectra for a sample of cool stars within 30 pc from the gc ; their results showed that [ o / fe ] and [ ca / fe ] are enhanced by 0.2 and 0.3 dex , respectively .",
    "they also found that the total range in [ fe / h ] in the gc is narrower than that found for the older bulge population .",
    "the aim of this paper is to compare our results with the data of ryde & schultheis ( 2015 ) in order to impose constraints on the formation and evolution of the gc .",
    "the analysis of the abundance ratios , such as [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios , versus [ fe / h ] can allow us to understand the timescale of the process of formation of the gc region .",
    "in fact , [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios can be used as cosmic clocks because of the time - delay model .",
    "the time - delay model is the common interpretation of abundance patterns in terms of different chemical elements produced from different stars and on different timescales . in this context ,",
    "starting from the fact that @xmath0-elements are produced on short timescales by core - collapse sne , whereas fe is produced partly in core - collapse sne but mainly in type ia sne exploding on longer timescales , we can interpret the observed abundances .",
    "high [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios at low [ fe / h ] indicate that the star formation period was short enough to prevent the type ia sne from polluting heavily the gas with fe . on the other hand",
    ", we always expect that the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios are lower at high [ fe / h ] because of type ia sn contribution",
    ". however , due to the combinationation of the star formation rate ( sfr ) and the time - delay in element production , objects where the sfr has been very intense show high [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios up to even solar [ fe / h ] values .",
    "this is because @xmath0-elements and part of fe are produced fast by core - collapse sne , which are able to enrich substantially the ism in fe before the bulk of this element is restored by sne ia ( see matteucci , 2012 ) .",
    "therefore , the comparison between observed and predicted abundances can tell us about the history of the chemical evolution of the gc and in particular on the origin of its stellar populations . to perform such a comparison",
    ", we adopt a model very similar to that presented in gmpc12 , in particular the model describing the classical bulge population which formed on a short timescale as a result of an intense burst of star formation ( the population called metal - poor ) , applied to a central region of only 200 pc of radius . in order to reproduce the star formation observed at the present time , we also overimpose on the history of star formation , deriving from our model , a recent burst producing the same quantity of stars that have been observed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe the chemical evolution model , in section 3 we describe the stellar spectroscopic data as well as the sfr estimates . in section 4",
    "we present our results and the comparison with data .",
    "in section 5 we draw some conclusions .",
    "the chemical evolution model we adopt here is the model of gmpc12 for the metal - poor ( mp ) stellar population in the galactic bulge . in other words",
    ", it is the model assuming a strong initial burst of star formation triggered by the heavy gas infall coming from the initial collapse that gave rise to the halo and the bulge .",
    "this model has been adapted here to the small central region around the galactic center ( gc ) .",
    "the assumed gas accretion law is : @xmath6 where @xmath7 represents a generic chemical element , @xmath8 is an appropriate infall timescale fixed by reproducing the observed stellar metallicity distribution function , and @xmath9 is a parameter constrained by the requirement of reproducing the current total surface mass density in the central region of the galactic bulge ; in particular , we assume a present time surface mass density at @xmath10 pc , @xmath11 , with @xmath1214 @xmath3 being the lifetime of the galaxy , and @xmath13 the galactocentric distance . we have obtained this value by assuming a mass distribution in the bulge which follows a sersic ( 1968 ) profile .",
    "the quantity @xmath14 is the abundance of the element @xmath7 in the infalling gas .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 will be allowed to vary in order to find the best agreement with the present time observables ( abundances , sfr and stellar mass ) .",
    "the star formation rate ( sfr ) is a schmidt- kennicutt law : @xmath15 with @xmath16 as in previous papers ( ballero et al .",
    "2007 ; cescutti & matteucci , 2011 ; gmpc12 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath17 is the efficiency of star formation , namely the sfr per unit mass of gas , and for the bulge is assumed to be high relative to that normally assumed in the solar vicinity ( @xmath18 , see for example chiappini et al .",
    "1997 ) , thus simulating a star burst .",
    "the efficiency of star formation is in units of @xmath19 and represents the inverse of the time scale in which all the gas is consumed .",
    "this approach was first suggested by matteucci & brocato ( 1990 ) and then proven to be required for reproducing the bulge properties in all the following papers dealing with the chemical evolution of the bulge .",

    "in particular , the prescriptions for different stellar mass ranges are :    * the yields of karakas ( 2010 ) for low and intermediate mass stars ( @xmath33 , lims ) , who has recomputed karakas & lattanzio s ( 2007 ) models with updated nuclear reaction rates and enlarged the grid of masses and metallicities . *",

    "there might also be unknown systematic uncertainties , such as non - lte effects , but since the standard red - giant star , arcturus , is among the analysed stars and gives reasonable results , these uncertainties can not be large .",

    "they found that the sfr dropped from an initial maximum roughly 10 @xmath3 ago to a minimum at 1 - 2 @xmath3 ago and that increased again in the last few hundred myrs .",
    "their results imply that @xmath280% of the total stellar mass in the gc formed more than 5 @xmath3 ago .",
    "two of the most important observational constraints to understand the most probable scenario for the bulge formation are the stellar metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) of stars and the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios .",
    "originally , matteucci & brocato ( 1990 ) suggested that in order to fit the mdf of the bulge one should assume that it formed very quickly .",
    "the consequence of the fast formation is a particular [ @xmath0/fe ] trend with super - solar values being present for a large interval of [ fe / h ] . in other words , while in the solar vicinity the `` knee '' of the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios occurs roughly at [ fe / h]@xmath2 - 1.0 , in the bulge the knee appears at [ fe / h]@xmath2 0 .",
    "this is due to the fact that in a regime of intense star formation , core - collapse sne from massive stars enrich the interstellar medium ( ism ) very fast in fe ( although they are not the main producers of this element ) , so when sne ia which produce the bulk of fe occur , the abundance of fe in the ism is already almost solar ( see matteucci 2001 , 2012 ) .",
    "we compare here the gc data with the chemical evolution model ( hereafter the reference model ) for a classical bulge of gmpc12 .",
    "we computed several numerical models by varying the most important parameters : the imf , the efficiency of star formation and the timescale of the infalling gas .",
    "the reference model parameters are : @xmath17=25 @xmath20 , @xmath8=0.1 @xmath3 and the salpeter imf in agreement with the gmpc12 g metal poor population . the data trend of figure [ mgsica_imf ] shows the effect of an intense burst of star formation coupled with the delay in the fe production from sne ia : since star formation is very intense , the bulge very soon reaches a solar metallicity because of the core collapse sn explosions , which produce part of the fe . after a time delay necessary to the evolution of the binary system progenitors of sne ia ,",
    "these sne , which produce the bulk of fe , start to explode changing the [ @xmath0/fe ] slope at a larger [ fe / h ] than in the solar vicinity .",
    "the models in figure [ mgsica_imf ] show also the effect of varying the imf : the ballero imf and the chabrier imf give very similar results since they are favouring massive stars compared to the kroupa et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and salpeter ( 1955 ) imfs .",
    "in particular , the kroupa et al .",
    "( 1993 ) imf which has been derived for the solar vicinity does not reproduce either the [ mg / fe ] or the [ ca / fe ] ratios , although it could reproduce the [ si / fe ] abundances . on the other hand , the salpeter ( 1955 )",
    "imf can reproduce the [ mg / fe ] and [ si / fe ] ratios .",
    "we note that none of the adopted imfs can reproduce the high values of the [ ca / fe ] ratios .",
    "this could be due to the uncertainties still existing in the stellar yields of specific elements , but also to observational errors .",
    "the abundance data are , in fact , more sensitive to the yield uncertainties rather than to the imf , whereas the stellar mdf is highly sensitive to the imf .        in figure [ mgsica_sfe ]",
    "we can see the effects of a different star formation efficiency on the [ mg / fe ] , [ si / fe ] , [ ca / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] trends : the green solid line is the reference model while the black dashed line is a model with an intense initial starburst with efficiency @xmath17=200 @xmath20 .",
    "this very high efficiency is probably unrealistic since it predicts that the gas is consumed in 5 myr . in any case , the differences among different models with @xmath56 and 200 @xmath20 are negligible . on the other hand , a @xmath57 as in the solar vicinity ( see chiappini et al .",
    "1997 ) would produce different results , in particular , all the curves would be translated at lower values of [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios .    in figure [ mgsica_tinf ]",
    "we show the effect of varying the infall timescale .",
    "the differences among different models are small and from the figure we can conclude that a timescale between 0.1 and 1.25 @xmath3 can be acceptable , whereas a timescale of 0.01 @xmath3 seems too short .        in figure [ mdf_sfe ] we show the predicted stellar mdf for the fiducial model and the two different values of @xmath17 . here , we can see that the effect of increasing @xmath17 results in a narrowing of the predicted mdf .",
    "it is worth noting that the number of observed stars in the gc is very small and therefore we do not aim at reproducing exactly the observed mdf but only at reproducing the position of the peak .",
    "the infall timescales also affect the mdf and in figure [ mdf_tinf ] we show the predicted mdf for the chabrier ( 2003 ) imf and different infall timescales ; we note that for this imf the infall timescale of 0.1 @xmath3 produces results more in agreement with observations , while longer timescales tend to predict a peak at too high metallicities .",
    "finally , in figure [ mdf_imf ] we show the effect of varying the imf on the predicted mdf , when the infall timescale is fixed at 0.7 @xmath3 . in this case",
    ", we note that the salpeter imf produces the best agreement and predicts the peak of the mdf at the right position .",
    "however , given the small number of observed stars , we are not able to disentangle the degeneracy between imf and infall timescale .",
    "what seems more clear is that an imf like kroupa et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , good for the solar vicinity , predicts the worst agreement with data when both the abundance ratios and the mdf in the gc are taken into account .",
    "previous models for the entire bulge ( brocato & matteucci , 1990 ; ballero et al . 2007 ; cescutti & matteucci , 2011 ; kobayashi et al .",
    "2011 ) have supported an imf which contains more massive stars than the one for the solar vicinity .            in summary",
    ", the comparison between data and model results suggests that the abundances in the gc are quite compatible with a fast formation of this region similarly to what happened to the entire bulge . the fact that the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios are low at high [ fe / h ] is not necessarily a sign of prolonged star formation .",
    "such a sign instead would be revealed by low [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios at low [ fe / h ] , as happens in dwarf irregular galaxies and dwarf spheroidals where the sfr was quite mild .",
    "a regime of low star formation , in fact , produces a situation where the gas is still poor in fe when type ia sne start producing the bulk of this element . at this point ,",
    "the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios start to decrease but the [ fe / h ] is still low .",
    "the fact that the star formation was quite strong in the early phases of formation of the central region is also evident in the mdf which is peaked at high metallicity .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that the number of stars observed in the gc is not yet statistically significant and therefore firm conclusions can not be drawn .",
    "we recall that in this section we have ignored the fact that recent star formation has been observed in the gc region , so in the next section we will explore the case in which a second burst has recently occurred and whether this recent sfr can affect our predictions .      in our standard model for the gc ,",
    "the bulk of the stars formed 10 @xmath3 ago and then the sfr decreased steadily until the present time to a value slightly lower than @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , to reproduce the observations indicating active star formation at the present time , we have simulated a star formation history made up of a first strong burst , where most of stars formed ( our fiducial model ) , plus a more recent starburst started 500 myr ago .",
    "we have tested different cases and verified the effects of this second starburst on the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios and the mdf .            in order to simulate the second burst",
    ", we simply assumed a second gas infall episode which increased suddenly the available mass of gas : @xmath59 where @xmath60 represents the cosmic time at which the second burst starts and @xmath61 is the infall timescale of the second burst ( see table 1 )",
    ". the origin of this gas can be either extragalactic or coming from the inner regions of the galactic disk thanks to the bar in the bulge .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we tested several cases but we show only the most realistic ones .",
    "in particular , we assumed : i ) a burst triggered by a strong infall of gas , comparable to the initial infall rate , ii ) a burst fueled by a more modest infall of gas relative to the previous one and iii ) a starburst due only to a sudden increase of the star formation efficiency from 25 to 200 @xmath20 without an extra - infall of gas .",
    "this case could simulate the effect of a nuclear bar , which simply compresses the existing gas . in the infall cases we tested both primordial and metal enriched infall .",
    "we found that the best model is model ii ) with a modest infall of new gas , which reproduces the estimated total mass of stars formed in the last 500 myr ( @xmath62 ) as well as the observed present time sfr ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "in fact , in case i ) the strong infall produces changes in the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios which are not seen in the data : in particular , the infall dilutes the abundances of heavy elements thus producing an inversion in the [ @xmath0/fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] plot showing very low [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios at low [ fe / h ] , not observed in the data .",
    "on the other hand , simply increasing the star formation efficiency ( model iii ) ) does not allow us to reproduce the observed present time sfr nor the observed gas in the gc .",
    "this is because the gas was already low 500 myr ago when the starburst was supposed to start .",
    "therefore , we suggest that this burst in the gc must have been triggered by accretion of new gas . the characteristics of the models i ) , ii ) and iii ) are reported in table 1 , where we show the timescale for the main infall episode ( @xmath8 ) , the star formation efficiency for this episode ( @xmath64 ) , the timescale for the infall giving rise to the second burst ( @xmath61 ) and the star formation efficiency in this second burst ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "finally , in column 6 the values of @xmath60 ( the time at which the second infall starts ) is reported .",
    "the best model appears to be model ii ) : it predicts a total mass of stars formed of @xmath66 and a present time sfr of @xmath67 , in good agreement with the observed values . in figure [ sfr_obs ]",
    "we show the predicted sfr history for model ii ) and we report also the observations .    in figure [ alpha_2infall ] we show the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios resulting from model i ) and ii ) which represent the case with a burst triggered by a strong gas infall and a modest gas infall , respectively . in the same figure",
    "is also shown an intermediate case showing that the inversion in the abundances , due to the dilution by infall , is independent of the onset time of the second strong burst .",
    "as one can see , a starburst triggered by a modest episode of primordial gas infall ( at an average rate of @xmath68 ) , occurring in the last hundreds million years and reproducing the present time sfr , produces negligible effects on the predicted [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios . on the other hand ,",
    "as already mentioned , a second starburst triggered by a strong infall of gas ( with an initial rate of @xmath69 ) would produce a noticeable but not observed effect in the data , even if the number of stars formed is the same .",
    "this case is clearly unrealistic since there is no physical justification for a strong late infall of primordial gas , but we show the resulting [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios for the sake of comparison with case ii ) .",
    "moreover , it is clear from figure [ alpha_2infall ] that none of the models with a late strong infall fits the data .",
    "we note that in all these cases we have chosen the model parameters to obtain acceptable values of the present time sfr as well as the total mass of stars formed . to do that we varied the star formation efficiencies and the infall timescale .",
    "the reason for the inversion in the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios is therefore only due to the gas infall and to the way in which chemical elements are produced and on which timescales . in particular ,",
    "when a starburst is overimposed on a very low star formation regime , triggered by a huge episode of gas accretion , the abundances present at the moment in the ism tend to be diluted by the infall , especially if the infalling gas is primordial , but at the same time they increase because of the new star formation .",
    "therefore , according to the predominance of one or the other process , the abundances tend to increase or decrease . in our cases",
    "the abundances of fe and the @xmath0-elements initially tend to decrease because of the infall , thus producing a reverse trend at constant [ @xmath0/fe ] , then as a result of the new production of @xmath0-elements by type ii sne , the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios increase strongly .",
    "this is also due to the fact that fe is not increasing immediately at the beginning of the second burst for the simple reason that fe is mainly produced on long timescales by type ia sne .",
    "no stars seem to be observed with the [ @xmath0/fe ] and [ fe / h ] values predicted by the models with a late second starburst triggered by a huge gas infall . only a model with a second very early",
    "starburst would not affect the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios , as expected .",
    "this fact suggests that a strong burst like the one we have hypothesized in model i ) can not have occurred , otherwise it would have left a clear signature in the abundance pattern , and we have verified that this is true also for enriched infall . on the other hand ,",
    "a minor burst triggered by either primordial or pre - enriched gas ( enriched in metals ) would produce negligible effects on the stellar abundances , as we have shown in figure 8 . concerning the mdf we tested model ii ) and",
    "no differences were produced by the second infall .",
    "in this paper we have studied the chemical evolution of the central region of the galactic bulge ( 200 pc radius ) and compared our results with the recent data from ryde & schultheis ( 2015 ) concerning @xmath0-elements and fe and the present time star formation rate ( morris & serabyn 1996 , yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "2009 , molinari et al . 2011 and",
    "immer et al . 2012 ) .",
    "we have tested different imfs , efficiencies of star formation and infall timescales .",
    "we also assumed a recent and ongoing burst of star formation where @xmath70 of new stars formed .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarized as follows :    * a comparison between data and models suggests that the [ @xmath0(mg , si , ca)/fe ] ratios in the gc can be reproduced by a model assuming a strong star formation at the beginning such as that assumed for the whole bulge by previous models ( matteucci & brocato , 1990 ; ballero et al .",
    "2007 ; cescutti & matteucci 2011 ; grieco et al . 2012 ) . under this assumption ,",
    "most of the stars in the gc have formed at the beginning ( more than 10 @xmath3 ago ) and the sfr has decreased steadily until the present time . * for [ mg / fe ] and [ si / fe ] we can conclude that a classical salpeter imf can reproduce the data , whereas for ca the data always lie above the predictions and this is true also for the other assumed imfs . we conclude that for ca there could be a problem with stellar yields .",
    "in fact , stellar yields of some elements are still uncertain : here , we have adopted the set of stellar yields , for stars of all masses , considered the best to reproduce the abundance patterns in the solar vicinity ( romano et al .",
    "2010 , where also a discussion on the uncertainties on stellar yields can be found ) .",
    "* we have varied the efficiency of star formation from 20 @xmath20 to 200 @xmath20 and found practically no difference in the results concerning the [ @xmath0/fe ] vs.[fe / h ] relations , whereas the mdf allows us to exclude the efficiency of 200 @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the efficiency of star formation in the gc is similar to that inferred for the whole bulge ( gmpc12 ) , namely 20 - 25 @xmath20 .",
    "* we have tested different imfs : salpeter , chabrier , ballero and kroupa93 and found that salpeter , ballero and chabrier imfs are probably the best to describe the gc , in agreement with previous results for the whole bulge suggesting an imf with more massive stars than in the solar vicinity ( matteucci & brocato , 1990 ; ballero et al .",
    "2007 ; cescutti & matteucci , 2011 ; grieco et al . 2012 ) ; in fact , they produce the best fits of the [ @xmath0/fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] relations as well as the mdf , at the same time .",
    "however , the salpeter imf requires an infall timescale longer ( 0.7 @xmath3 ) than the other two imfs ( 0.1 @xmath3 ) to fit the data .",
    "given the uncertainties still existing in the data we are not able at the moment to solve this degeneracy and therefore to draw firm conclusions on this point , but we can say that the infall timescale for the formation of the bulk of gc stars was short . *",
    "we tested also the effect of changing the infall timescale and varied this timescale from 0.01 @xmath3 ( practically a closed - box model ) to 1.25 @xmath3 .",
    "again , with the exception of ca , for which all the model predictions lie below the data , the mg and si data are compatible with timescales in the range 0.1 - 1.25 @xmath3 , whereas the mdf is compatible with a range 0.1 - 07 @xmath3 . * finally , we tested the effects of a second very recent burst occurring in the last five hundreds million years and having a sfr and a total amount of formed stars comparable to those observed .",
    "we have found that such a burst , if triggered by a new modest infall episode of gas of primordial composition , would not produce any noticeable effect in the [ @xmath0/fe ] relations and the mdf . on the other hand",
    ", we tested also a case of a starburst triggered by a huge gas infall , still producing the same present time sfr and total mass of new stars , and found that in this case the [ @xmath0/fe ] are strongly affected by the infall .",
    "in particular , we predict very low values of [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios at low [ fe / h ] , which are not observed . *",
    "therefore , we conclude that the stars in the gc formed very quickly with a star formation efficiency of @xmath71 , and that the imf should contain a larger number of massive stars than the typical imf for the solar vicinity , such as the kroupa et al .",
    "in particular , the recent imf of chabrier ( 2003 ) seems to be preferred .",
    "the present time observed sfr in the gc can be explained by a second burst of star formation with the same efficiency as the previous one and the same imf , triggered by a modest infall episode .",
    "this second burst would not produce evident effects on the abundance patterns nor on the mdf , and is compatible with gas accretion induced by the main bar in the bulge .",
