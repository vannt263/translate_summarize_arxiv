    "this result is achieved by using a combination of two properties @xmath2 and @xmath3 that we shall simply call the product of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ examples ] is devoted to some examples of properties with explicit threshold widths and locations . some of them , which arise from reliability theory , will be used further as elementary building blocks to derive more general widths . in section [ product ] , we derive the basic properties of the product of @xmath2 and @xmath3 which turns out to have a simple interpretation in terms of failure sets .",
    "we prove that the product of @xmath2 and @xmath3 has a threshold width which is the product of that of @xmath2 and @xmath3 as soon as the threshold of @xmath3 is located away from 0 and 1 .",
    "this result allows us to obtain in section [ seuilsintermediaires ] some symmetric properties of @xmath8 with arbitrary threshold widths between @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we also study the case where the threshold of @xmath3 tends to 0 or 1 .",
    "although we do not give an extensive understanding of what may happen , we show in section [ coarsesharp ] that if @xmath2 and @xmath3 have a threshold located respectively in 0 and 1 , then @xmath63 has a sharp threshold .",
    "in presenting the following examples of thresholds , our aim is twofold .",
    "first , we want to describe some of the few already known types of behaviour .",
    "second , we shall use some of these examples in section [ seuilsintermediaires ] , to derive more general widths thanks to the product of properties .",
    "one of the typical examples of threshold phenomena is that of the random graphs @xmath64 ( see erds and rnyi @xcite , bollobs @xcite , spencer @xcite ) . the graph @xmath65 has @xmath4 vertices , and each one of the @xmath66 possible edges is present with probability @xmath5 , independently from the others .",
    "once a labelling of the vertices is choosen , one can denote by @xmath67 the probability space of the random graph @xmath65 .",
    "small balanced subgraphs +    let @xmath68 be a fixed connected graph with @xmath69 vertices and @xmath70 edges , and suppose that @xmath68 is balanced , that is to say none of its subgraphs has average degree strictly smaller than @xmath68 .",
    "denote by @xmath71 the property for a graph to contain at least one copy of @xmath68 .",
    "the threshold of @xmath71 is located at @xmath72 , i.e @xmath73 , and has width of the same order ( cf .",
    "spencer @xcite for instance ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath71 has a coarse threshold .",
    "connectivity + it is known ( see bollobs @xcite ) , that the probability for @xmath64 to be connected goes from @xmath74 to @xmath75 when @xmath76 , and @xmath55 goes from @xmath77 to @xmath78 . in this example , the threshold is located around @xmath79 i.e @xmath80 , and its width is of order @xmath81 , i.e @xmath82 .",
    "thus , this threshold is sharp .",
    "let us turn to examples occuring in reliability theory . in this framework , at instant @xmath83 ,",
    "two characteristic quantities of the system are especially important : the reliability , that is the probability that there never occured any breakdown before @xmath83 , and the non - availability , which is the probability that the system is down at instant @xmath83 ( see for instance barlow and proschan @xcite ) . of course , these quantities differ if the system is repairable .",
    "the analysis of the reliability of large systems , for instance its asymptotic behaviour , is generally much more difficult than the analysis of the non - availablity .",
    "we shall only focus on the latter one , but want to stress the fact that when one deals with a large system composed of repairable markovian components , it is natural to expect strong similarities between the asymptotics of the two quantities ( see for example paroissin and ycart @xcite ) . when @xmath84 denotes a system composed of @xmath4 binary components",
    ", one can describe the states of these components as a state in @xmath8 , 1 standing for a failed component , and 0 for a working component .",
    "one can therefore associate to @xmath84 its failure subset , which is the subset @xmath2 of @xmath8 containing all the configurations of the @xmath4 components such that the system @xmath84 fails .",
    "if we assume that a component is failed independently from the others with probability @xmath5 , @xmath7 is the distribution of the state of @xmath84 in @xmath8 , and @xmath85 is the non - availability of @xmath84 .",
    "it is very natural to assume that the subset @xmath86 is monotone ( if the system is down , and a component fails , then the system remains down ) .",
    "the question of how quickly @xmath85 `` jumps from 0 to 1 '' is of great importance ( see paroissin and ycart @xcite for an application of the works of friedgut and kalai @xcite and bourgain et al .",
    "@xcite in this context ) .",
    "the main result of this article , theorem [ thmlargeursvariees ] , relies on examples [ exksurn ] and [ exparser ] .",
    "[ exksurn]@xmath57-out - of-@xmath4 system + the system is failed when the total number of failed components is greater than a certain threshold @xmath87 .",
    "the failure subset is therefore : @xmath88 note that the particular cases of @xmath89 and @xmath90 correspond respectively to parallel and series system . obviously , @xmath91 is monotone and invariant under every permutation of the coordinates .",
    "it is therefore a monotone symmetric subset of @xmath8 .",
    "since the sum @xmath92 has mean @xmath93 and variance @xmath94 when @xmath95 is distributed according to @xmath10 , one can guess , intuitively , that @xmath91 has a threshold located at @xmath96 , and of order @xmath97 .",
    "we shall precise this intuition when @xmath98 in lemma [ lemseuilsqrtn ] .",
    "[ exparser]parallel - series system + a parallel - series system contains @xmath99 components which are assembled into @xmath100 blocks containing @xmath101 composants .",
    "the system is failed as soon as a block is failed , and a block fails if all its components are failed .",
    "of course , the non - availability of such a system is very easy to derive .",
    "let @xmath86 denote its failure subset : @xmath102 for example , when @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , the threshold of @xmath86 is located at @xmath106 with a width of order @xmath1 ( see lemma [ lemseuillogn ] below ) .",
    "remark that @xmath86 is monotone and symmetric ( under permutation of the components inside a block and permutation of the blocks ) .",
    "such systems , with multi - states components instead of binary ones , have been studied by kolowrocki @xcite , and a concrete application is presented in @xcite .",
    "one can also define the dual system called series - parallel system , in which components are assembled into @xmath100 blocks containing @xmath101 composants , the system is failed when all blocks are failed , and a block is failed as soon as one component is failed .",
    "[ exkconn]consecutive @xmath57-out - of-@xmath4 system + components are arranged around a circle .",
    "the system is failed as soon as there are at least @xmath87 consecutive components down .",
    "this model has an asymptotic behaviour similar to the parallel - series system with @xmath107 blocks of @xmath57 components .",
    "for example , when @xmath108 , the threshold of the failure subset is located at @xmath106 , with a width of order @xmath1 ( for a similar result , see paroissin and ycart @xcite ) .",
    "this model was introduced by kontoleon @xcite to model some problems arising in engineering science , such as oil transportation using pipelines , telecommunication system by spacecraft relay station or transmission of data in a ring of computer ring networks , etc .",
    "as far as we know , whereas the influence of simple operations between properties has been extensively studied whithin the so - called 0 - 1 laws which occur in logic ( see compton @xcite ) , no such work has been undertaken regarding the threshold phenomena .",
    "the first combinations of properties that come to mind , union and intersection , behave quite in an unpleasant way with respect to the threshold width ( see @xcite , chapter 3 ) . in this section",
    ", we will show the nice behaviour of another combination which we simply call the product . even though linearity does not play any role in this setting",
    ", it is worth noting the similarity between this product and the kronecker product of matrices . given two properties @xmath2 and @xmath3 , on two distinct spaces , their product is a property combining the belongings to @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the following way .    [ deftens ]",
    "let @xmath2 be a subset of @xmath109 and @xmath3 a subset of @xmath110 .",
