    "because the central features of a system can often be elucidated with simple models , and because neutrino emission is  from nature s point of view of raw energetics  the central feature of core - collapse supernovae , one may hope to understand the basic features of supernova neutrino emission quickly and easily .    shortly after the discovery of the neutron in the early 1930s baade and zwicky declared : `` with all reserve we advance the view that supernovae represent the transitions from ordinary stars to _ neutron stars , _ which in their final stages consist of extremely closely packed neutrons '' @xcite .",

    "once conditions for their production are reached , the weakness of neutrino interactions implies that their emission is the most efficient means of cooling .",
    "neutrino emission is responsible for the degeneracy of the precollapse stellar core of mass @xmath7 ( the chandrasekhar mass ) ; the core s eventual instability , at least in part ; and the energy loss of about @xmath8 that ultimately allows collapse to proceed to radius @xmath9 as a cold neutron star.[multiblock footnote omitted ]    basic characterizations of the precollapse core and the cold neutron star to which it collapses may be sufficient to estimate the total energy loss to neutrinos , but additional features of this emission  which flavors are emitted , at what energies , over what time scales  depend crucially on the flow of electron lepton number and the generation of entropy .",
    "` neutronization ' via electron capture entails the flow of electron lepton number from degenerate electrons to electron neutrinos , and the thermal energy associated with finite entropy results in the thermal emission of neutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors .",

    "@xmath19 pairs , there must be allowance for arbitrary degeneracy in @xmath20 pairs , relativistic @xmath10 pairs , and nonrelativistic neutrons and protons .",
    "for relativistic pairs of arbitrary degeneracy there are simple expressions for the differences of number densities and the sums of energy densities of particles and antiparticles , as well as the entropy @xcite . for the nonrelativistic nucleons",
    "the needed quantities can be derived from the landau potential @xmath21 .",
    "this can be written in terms of a polylogarithm function as @xmath22 $ ] , whose symbolic derivatives and numerical evaluation can be handled by any self - respecting symbolic mathematics package ( though the sommerfeld expansion seems more reliable for @xmath23 ) .",
    "the global neutron star states are characterized by two parameters ( the entropy per baryon @xmath24 and the lepton fraction @xmath25 ) and seven unknowns ( @xmath4 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 ) .",

[ neutrinos ] ) , involving an energy loss of about @xmath35 erg and the sudden release of trapped electron lepton number .",
    "and @xmath36 has a total energy @xmath37 much lower than @xmath38 ( the energy lost to @xmath14 escape during infall ) , so it can not be the post - bounce state .",

    "hence as the core rebounds to this radius , @xmath14 with @xmath51 mev escape freely in a burst in which a lepton fraction @xmath52 and energy @xmath53 are lost during a time @xmath54 ms that characterizes this ` burst state . ' in order to find @xmath52 , a sequence of states is searched by decreasing @xmath55 while adjusting @xmath24 to stay just below the ( varying ) @xmath14 trapping radius .",
    "all such states are found to be characterized by @xmath56 , all the way down to @xmath57 .",
    "the conclusion is that in this crude model the deleptonization accompanying the @xmath14 burst is essentially complete , with @xmath58 evaluated at the initial ` burst state . ' ] moreover , an additional @xmath59 erg or so is lost from the core before the dust settles after a dynamical time scale of about 24 ms post - bounce ; ; further energy loss is needed .",
    "but it is found at the end of this searched sequence that the population of thermal neutrinos of all flavors has begun to make a nontrivial contribution to @xmath37 , so their emission is now a viable means of prompt energy loss so long as the star is outside the trapping radius of these flavors .",
    "hence our ` post - bounce state ' after the dust settles is that characterized by @xmath60 and the highest entropy per baryon that keeps the star within the smallest trapping radius ( that of @xmath61 and their antiparticles , which as described in the previous footnote have the largest mean free path ) .",
    "this is the state with @xmath62 and @xmath63 km at the far right of fig .",

    "[ neutronstar ] ) , this energy is lost to neutrino emission of all flavors ( albeit with a modest hierarchy of luminosities and average energies ) over a period of many seconds , as depicted in fig . [",

    "the luminosities @xmath66 and average energies @xmath67 for the various species are found by equating two different expressions for the neutrino luminosities necessary to allow a transition between two successive neutron star states . defining @xmath68 to be the difference in @xmath37 between two successive states in the sequence , and assuming that the star contrives to release an equal amount of energy in each flavor , one expression is the ratio of @xmath69 to the neutrino diffusion time scale @xmath70 ( given for the various species in a previous footnote ) at that point in the sequence .",
    "a second expression for luminosity is @xmath71 , a neutrino version of the stefan - boltzmann law with @xmath72 .",

    "that some basic features of supernova neutrino emission can be motivated by a stick - figure - quality model provides a baseline degree of instant gratification .",
    "this is in contrast to the explosion manifest in an expanding supernova remnant s kinetic energy , which , as a 1% subsidiary detail from nature s perspective , has been requiring decades of detailed study by numerous people to understand @xcite .    but stick figures do not ultimately satisfy , of course ; we long for the voluptuous contours of a fully - fleshed - out model .",
    "in fact , under thorough dissection the simple model of the previous section might stand revealed as more retrospectively illustrative than predictively robust .",
    "this is one indication of the ultimate necessity of detailed simulations .",
    "another is that the details of early neutrino emission and the explosion are more interrelated than some of my previous comments might suggest . whether it be by playing the spoiler , acting as agent of explosion , or setting the conditions necessary to the operation of some other mechanism ,",
