    "2003 ; robson et al . 2004 ; beelen et al .",
    "the presence of these large quantities of dust at such early epoch when the universe was @xmath101 gyr old , suggests the rapid enrichment with dust that formed in the explosive ejecta of short - lived massive stars ( morgan & edmunds 2003 , maiolino et al . 2004b ; dwek et al . 2007 ) .",
    "in addition , maiolino et al .",
    "( 2004a ) have reported that the dust extinction curve of the broad absorption line quasar sdss1048 + 46 at @xmath11 is quite different than those of quasars at @xmath12 , suggesting different dust sources and evolutionary histories .",
    "dust plays a pivotal role in the interstellar processes that determine the state of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "dust affects the thermal and chemical balance of the ism by reprocessing the radiative outputs from stars , providing photoelectrons that heat the gas , and depleting the gas of refractory elements that are important cooling agents of the ism .",
    "dust also serves as a catalyst for chemical reactions , especially the formation of h@xmath13 molecules on the surface of dust grains ( hirashita & ferrara 2002 ; cazaux & spaans 2004 ) .",
    "in addition , the cooling of gas through thermal radiation from dust triggers the fragmentation of star - forming cloud into low - mass gas clumps of @xmath140.11 @xmath15 even for the metallicity of @xmath16@xmath17 @xmath18 ( omukai et al .",
    "2005 ; schneider et al .",
    "2006 ) , although very massive stars of @xmath19100 @xmath15 are considered to be formed up to @xmath20 @xmath18 without the effect of dust ( bromm et al .",
    "2001 ) . finally , dust obscures the nature of underlying stellar populations ( e.g. , hines et al .",
    "2006 ) and physical processes in the early universe .",
    "understanding the origin and the complex evolutionary history of dust is therefore one of the most important goals in astrophysics .    during the first gyr of cosmic history ,",
    "supernovae ( sne ) are the only possible source of interstellar dust , since low mass stars have not had time to evolve off the main sequence and inject the dust that forms in their quiescent outflows into the ism .",
    "theoretical studies aimed at determining the composition and yield of dust in the ejecta of primordial type ii sne ( sne ii ) and pair - instability sne ( pisne ) were conducted by todini & ferrara ( 2001 ) , nozawa et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and schneider et al .",
    "these works have shown that even the first sne evolving from zero - metal progenitor stars can efficiently produce dust at 150800 days after the explosion .",
    "the ratio of the total dust mass to the progenitor mass @xmath21 is 0.020.05 for sne ii with @xmath22 1235 @xmath15 and 0.150.3 for pisne with @xmath22 140260 @xmath15 .",
    "the composition of the newly formed dust grains are controlled by the elemental composition inside the he core , and their sizes range from 0.001 @xmath4 to 1 @xmath4 , depending on the concentration of the gas species forming dust and the time evolution of temperature and density of gas .",
    "the results of these calculations have been applied to study the high - redshift dust .",
    "maiolino et al .",
    "( 2004b ) demonstrated a sn origin for high - redshift dust , showing that the extinction curve of the @xmath11 quasar sdss1048 + 46 can be nicely fitted by the sn ii dust models from todini & ferrara ( 2001 ) .",
    "dust produced in the unmixed sne ii by nozawa et al .",
    "( 2003 ) can also successfully reproduce the extinction curve of the quasar sdss1048 + 46 by weighting the progenitor mass with the salpeter initial mass function ( hirashita et al .",
    "2005 ) . adopting the dust models by nozawa et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , nozawa et al .",
    "( 2006 ) investigated the destruction of dust in the early ism by the high - velocity shocks driven by sne , and derived the timescale of dust destruction in the early universe as a function of the explosion energy of sne and the gas density in the ism .",
    "it should be pointed out here that these studies implicitly assumed that dust grains formed in sne are injected into the ism without their composition and size distribution being reprocessed .",
    "however , the interaction of the sn ejecta with the surrounding medium will create a reverse shock which will process the grains that condensed in the he core before their injection into the ism .",
    "once the newly formed dust grains encounter the reverse shock , they acquire the high velocities relative to the gas and penetrate into the hot gas created by the passage of the reverse shock and forward shock .",
    "these dust grains are eroded by the kinetic sputtering and are also decelerated by the drag force of the gas .",
    "small grains decelerate efficiently , and become trapped in the hot gas , where they are efficiently destroyed by thermal sputtering . on the other hand , large grains can maintain their high velocities , pass through the shocked gas and the outwardly expanding shock front , and be injected into the ism without significant destruction .",
    "the net amount and composition of the dust that is eventually returned to the ism by sne differs substantially from the dust that was in the sn ejecta shortly after its formation .    in this paper , we study the evolution of dust formed in primordial sne ii and pisne , considering its processing through the collisions with the reverse shocks and its transport within snrs , based on the dust formation calculations by nozawa et al .",
    "the questions that we pose here are what fraction of dust grains formed in population iii sne can survive the hostile circumstances within snrs and how their size distributions can be altered by sputtering in the postshock flow .",
    "this subject has not been fully explored to date .",
    "recently , bianchi & schneider ( 2007 ) have studied the evolution of newly condensed grains through the passage of the reverse shock by using a semi - analytical model and have showed that the fraction of dust mass survived ranges between 2 % and 20 % depending on the density in the ism .",
    "however , they consider only the dust evolution in the nonradiative phase of snr up to about 48@xmath23 yr from the sn explosion , without taking into account the motion of dust relative to gas caused by the drag force which strongly affects the destruction process and evolution of dust in snrs . in the calculations",
    ", we carefully treat the dynamics and destruction of dust and the time evolution of the temperature and density of the gas within snrs until @xmath14@xmath24@xmath25 yr extending over a period of the radiative phase , in order to reveal how much amount of dust is finally injected into the ism or destroyed completely . although we focus on population iii sne in this paper , this study can also give great insight into the evolution of dust in galactic snrs .    in   2 , we describe the initial conditions for the evolution of snrs , the model of dust inside the he core , and the physics of dust and gas within snrs . in   3 , we present and discuss the results of calculations . in   4",
    ", we shall discuss the effects of the hydrogen envelope on the evolution of dust in snrs . as an application of the result",
    ", we investigate the abundance patterns of the second - generation stars formed in the dense shell of population iii snrs in ",
    "the summary is presented in   6 .",
    "the evolution of snr is described by three characteristic parameters ; explosion energy , ejecta mass , and the density profile of the ambient gas ( truelove & mckee 1999 ) . in this paper , we focus on the evolution of ejecta expanding into a uniform ambient medium whose elemental composition is primordial . to investigate the dependence of the efficiency of dust destruction on the ambient gas density , we consider three cases for the hydrogen number density in the ism ; @xmath26 0.1 , 1 , and 10 @xmath2 .",
    "the temperature of gas @xmath27 in the ism can be also affect the evolution of snrs , since the ambient pressure regulates the deceleration of blast wave .",
    "however , we have confirmed that the results of calculations are almost independent of the value of @xmath27 , provided that @xmath28@xmath24 k. thus , we assume here @xmath29 k regardless of the gas density in the ism , referring to the studies showing that the radiative feedback from the massive pre - sn stars can cause the ambient ism to heat up to @xmath30 k ( kitayama et al . 2004",
    "; machida et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the initial conditions for the structures of density and velocity in the ejecta are taken from the hydrodynamic models of population iii sne by umeda & nomoto ( 2002 ) .",
    "we adopt six sn models ; four sne ii and two pisne .",
    "the explosion energy of sne ii with @xmath22 13 , 20 , 25 , and 30 @xmath15 is @xmath31 erg , and that of pisne with @xmath22 170 and 200 @xmath15 is @xmath32 erg and @xmath33 erg , respectively .",
    "it should be mentioned here that the massive metal - free stars can not lose significant mass during their lifetime due to pulsations and line - driven stellar winds which are considered to be important at high metallicities ( baraffe et al .",
    "although smith & owocki ( 2006 ) have suggested that the mass loss of very massive stars above roughly 4050 @xmath15 may be possible by continuum - driven winds or hydrodynamic explosions being insensitive to metallicity , the mechanism to trigger such a mass loss is an open question .",
    "thus , we consider that population iii pisne as well as sne ii have retained their thick hydrogen envelopes at the time of explosion .      in the ejecta of sne , dust grains can nucleate and grow only in the metal - rich cooling gas , and their composition and size distribution largely depend on the elemental abundance inside the he core ( kozasa et al . 1989 ) .",
    "accordingly , nozawa et al . (",
    "2003 ) have calculated the dust formation in population iii sne by considering two cases for the elemental composition inside the he core .",
    "they found that in the unmixed ejecta with the original onion - like structure , a variety of grain species condense in each layer .",
    "the main grain species are c grain in carbon - rich he layer ; al@xmath13o@xmath34 , mg@xmath13sio@xmath35 , and mgo grains in o - mg - si layer ; al@xmath13o@xmath34 , mgsio@xmath34 , and sio@xmath13 grains in o - si - mg layer ; si and fes grains in si - s - fe layer ; fe grain in the innermost fe - ni core . on the other hand , oxide ( al@xmath13o@xmath34 and fe@xmath34o@xmath35 ) and silicate ( mgsio@xmath34 , mg@xmath13sio@xmath35 , and sio@xmath13 )",
    "grains are formed in the uniformly mixed ejecta with c / o @xmath36 , where the efficiency of unity is assumed for the formation of co and sio molecules .",
    "dust grains inside the he core are never processed by kinetic or thermal sputtering before they hit the reverse shock , because they move with the same velocities as the gas , and the gas temperature within the he core is too low for dust grains to be destroyed by the thermal sputtering .",
    "therefore , as the initial condition of dust residing within the he core , we adopt the size distribution , mass fraction , and spatial distribution of each dust species calculated by nozawa et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . in what follows",
    ", we refer to the dust grains created in the unmixed and mixed ejecta as the unmixed grain model and the mixed grain model , respectively .",
    "the collision of the expanding sn ejecta with the surrounding ism simultaneously creates a forward shock at the interface between the ejecta and the ism , and a reverse shock that penetrates into the ejecta .",
    "once the reverse shock encounters dust grains inside the he core , the dust grains are decoupled from the comoving gas to ballistically intrude into the hot gas heated by the reverse shock , and then they are eroded via the kinetic sputtering because of high velocities relative to gas .",
    "if dust grains are trapped into the postshock flow owing to the gas drag , they are destroyed via the thermal sputtering caused by the thermal motion of gas .",
    "these dust particles are also heated by the collisions with the gas and radiate the thermal emission to cool the postshock gas .",
    "the rates of deceleration , erosion by sputtering , and heating of dust grains depend on not only their chemical composition and size but also the temperature and density of the gas in the postshock flow .",
    "recently , nozawa et al . ( 2006 , nkh06 ) have calculated the dust destruction in the high - velocity interstellar shocks driven by sne in the early universe , by carefully treating the dynamics , erosion , and heating of dust grains , taking account of their size distribution and the time evolution of the temperature and density of the gas in the postshock flow .",
    "the present calculations of the dust evolution within snrs follow the method described in nkh06 ( see , nkh06 for details ) .",
    "we briefly mention the outline , focusing on the difference in the cooling function used in the calculations.@xmath37 ( draine & salpeter 1979 ) , where @xmath38 is the dimensionless potential parameter , @xmath39 is the coulomb cutoff factor , and @xmath40 is defined by @xmath41 with @xmath42 the mass of gas and @xmath43 the velocity of dust relative to gas .",
    "@xmath44 for @xmath45 ( draine & salpeter 1979 ) , @xmath463040 in snrs ( dwek & arendt 1992 ) , and @xmath38 is evaluated to be @xmath14@xmath47 for the gas temperatrure of @xmath48 k ( mckee et al .",
    "thus , the coulomb drag is negligible compared with the gas drag for @xmath49 k , otherwise it can play important role in the deceleration of dust .",
    "however , the erosion rate of dust grains by thermal sputtering quickly decreases at @xmath50 k ( nkh06 ) . as a result",
    ", the coulomb drag does not significantly affect the motion and destruction of dust grains considered in this paper . ]",
    "we assume that the spherically symmetric ejecta collides with the ism in 10 yr after the explosion . with the initial conditions described in   2.1 ,",
    "the time evolution of the gas in snrs is numerically solved with the flux - splitting method ( van albada , et al .",
    "1982 ; mair et al . 1988 ) . in the calculations , we include three processes of the radiative cooling in the equation of the conservation of energy .",
    "the first is the thermal emission from dust collisionally heated in the postshock flow , and the second is the inverse compton cooling , whose rate is calculated at the redshift of @xmath51 .",
    "the third is the cooling of gas by the atomic process .",
    "for the gas with the primordial composition in the hydrogen envelope and behind the forward shock , we adopt the atomic cooling function for the zero metal case given by sutherland & dopita ( 1993 ) that is limited to the gas temperature of @xmath52 k. in order to calculate the evolution of the gas in the dense shell appeared at the later phase of snrs , we extrapolate the cooling rate of gas at @xmath53 k as follows .",
    "referring to machida et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , the atomic cooling rate at @xmath54 k is approximately proportional to @xmath55 ; the cooling rate decreases from @xmath56 erg @xmath2 s@xmath57 at @xmath58 k to @xmath59 erg @xmath2 s@xmath57 at @xmath60 k. therefore , we simply evaluate the atomic cooling rate as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the gas temperature in units of @xmath63 k and @xmath64 is the atomic cooling rate at @xmath65 k. for the metal - rich he core , we assume that the gas is only composed of oxygen which is the most abundant gas species inside the he core , and employ the cooling functions from smith et al . (",
    "2001 ) for @xmath66 k and raymond & smith ( 1977 ) for @xmath67 k. in the calculations , we ignore the contribution of cooling by metal ions released from dust by sputtering for simplicity .",
    "the dynamics and destruction of dust after colliding with the reverse shocks are calculated as follows . by treating dust as a test particle and ignoring the effect of charge on dust grains , the deceleration rate of dust due to the gas drag",
    "is calculated for each size of the dust to evaluate the velocity relative to gas and the position .",
    "then we calculate the dust destruction by sputtering and the heating by collisions with the gas , using the relative velocity and the temperature and density of gas at the position .",
    "the sputtering yield of each dust species is calculated with the universal relation derived by nkh06 .",
    "dust grains are considered to be completely destroyed when their sizes become smaller than the radius of the nominal monomer of condensate .",
    "the cooling of gas through thermal emission of dust is calculated by balancing the heating of dust resulting from the collisions with electrons .",
    "the calculations are performed by the truncation time at which the forward shock velocity decelerates below 20 km s@xmath57 .",
    "in this section , we present the results of the calculations of dust evolution within primordial snrs . in   3.1 , we demonstrate the time evolution of temperature and density of gas in the snr , and in   3.2 , we show the transport and destruction of dust grains within snrs . in   3.3 , we provide the resulting size distribution of survived dust and elucidate the dependence of the efficiency of dust destruction on the progenitor mass and the gas density in the ism .",
    "figure 1 shows the time evolution of the density ( fig .",
    "1a ) and temperature ( fig .",
    "1b ) of gas by @xmath68 yr in the snr generated from the explosion of star with @xmath69 @xmath15 and expanding into the ism with @xmath1 @xmath2 .",
    "the unmixed grain model is taken as the model of dust inside the he core , and the cooling of gas by dust is taken into account . in what follows , we refer to this model as the standard model .",
    "the forward shock resulting from the interaction of the ambient gas with the ejecta of the sn is specified by the steep rise of the gas temperature and the increase of the gas density by @xmath144 times that in the ism .",
    "the downward arrows in figure 1a show the positions of the forward shock .",
    "we can also identify the formation of the reverse shock from high temperature of gas heated by the compression of the ejecta , and indicate its position for each time by the downward arrow in figure 1b .    the position @xmath70 ( fig .",
    "2a ) and velocity @xmath71 ( fig .",
    "2b ) of this reverse shock as a function of time are depicted by the thick solid curves in figure 2 .",
    "the reverse shock is decelerated by the shocked ambient medium while it initially expands outward , and then returns back at a distance of @xmath145 pc ( @xmath72 cm ) with the velocity of a few 100 km s@xmath57 .",
    "the trajectory of the reverse shock is affected by the detail structure of density in the ejecta .",
    "the collision with the locally high - density gas inside the he core causes the reverse shock to move outward again at 5200 yr .",
    "after @xmath73 yr , the reverse shock goes inward through the he core with increasing its velocity up to @xmath741000 km s@xmath57 . hence , dust grains crossing the reverse shock acquire the different velocities relative to gas , depending on the time of collision with the reverse shock , and are efficiently eroded by the kinetic sputtering if the relative velocity is @xmath145001300 km s@xmath57 .",
    "it can be seen from figure 1 that the temperature of the gas in the region between the forward and reverse shocks is higher than @xmath25 k. thus , dust grains staying in this region are subject to the thermal sputtering .",
    "however , the erosion rate of dust decreases as the snr evolves because the density decreases with time . around the truncation time",
    "( @xmath758 @xmath76 yr for the standard model ) , the gas density within the snr is more than 100 times lower than that in the ism , and the gas temperature becomes low ( @xmath14several times @xmath24 k ) enough for dust grains not to be sputtered efficiently , and thus the destruction of dust via the sputtering is extremely inefficient .",
    "the influence of the cooling by dust on the snr evolution is clarified by comparing the results of calculations with and without the cooling by dust emission .",
    "the evolution of the reverse shock without the dust cooling for @xmath77 @xmath15 and @xmath78 @xmath2 is shown by the thick dashed curves in figure 2 , where the cooling of gas by dust can cause the velocity of the reverse shock to be reduced by @xmath1410 % .",
    "the thin curves in figure 2 show the evolution of the reverse shock penetrating into the ejecta of pisn with @xmath79 @xmath15 calculated for @xmath78 @xmath2 . because the thermal emission from dust increases with increasing the dust mass , the effects of cooling by dust are significant for the remnants of pisne , where the mass of dust formed in the ejecta is a few tens @xmath15 .",
    "as we can see from the figure , the velocity of the reverse shock including dust cooling ( _ thin solid line _ ) decreases to 0.6 times that not including the cooling ( _ thin dashed line _ ) at @xmath19 7000 yr . in addition , the dust cooling decreases the gas temperature by @xmath1420 % , compared with that calculated without dust cooling .",
    "however , it should be noted that the efficiency of dust destruction is little affected by the dust cooling , because most of dust grains are predominantly destroyed by the thermal sputtering and the erosion rate is not sensitive to the gas temperature as long as @xmath80 k ( nkh06 ) .",
    "note that the cooling by oxygen line has no influence on the results , since the temperature within the he core during the passage of the reverse shock is above @xmath81 k where the dominant cooling process of gas is free - free emission .",
    "the time evolutions of the positions ( fig .",
    "3a ) and sizes ( fig .",
    "3b ) of dust grains within the snr for the standard model are given in figure 3 . in figure 3a ,",
    "the trajectories of the forward and reverse shocks are also depicted by the thick solid curves , along with the position of the surface of the he core . among nine dust species in the unmixed grain model , are shown c , mg@xmath13sio@xmath35 , and fe grains with the initial sizes of 0.01 @xmath4 ( _ dotted lines _ ) , 0.1 @xmath4 ( _ solid lines _ ) , and 1 @xmath4 ( _ dashed lines _ ) , respectively .",
    "each grain species initially moves coupling with the gas with the velocity of @xmath141300 , @xmath14900 , and @xmath14400 km s@xmath57 for c , mg@xmath13sio@xmath35 , and fe grains , respectively , and collides with the reverse shock at 3650 yr for c grains formed in the outermost he core , 6300 yr for mg@xmath13sio@xmath35 grains in the oxygen - rich layer , and 13000 yr for fe grains condensed in the innermost he core .",
    "the collision time of the reverse shocks with dust grains depends on the initial velocity and position of dust , the thickness of the hydrogen envelope , and the density in the ism .",
    "figure 4 gives the collision time @xmath82 of the reverse shock with the he core for different progenitor mass and gas density in the ism .",
    "we can see that the collision time is shorter for pisne than sne ii , in spite of the fact that pisne have the thicker hydrogen envelopes .",
    "this reason is that the gas velocities ( @xmath1420003000 km s@xmath57 ) at the outermost he core for pisne with the explosion energies higher than 10@xmath83 erg are a few times higher than those for sne ii . for @xmath84 0.110",
    "@xmath2 , the collision times are @xmath7510@xmath8510@xmath86 yr and decrease with increasing the ambient gas density .",
    "note that this result is not consistent with the observations of the cas a snr , where thermal emission from dust heated by the reverse shock has already detected at @xmath75330 yr after the explosion ( ennis et al .",
    "2006 and references therein ) .",
    "this is because the progenitor of the cas a is believed to have lost the considerable hydrogen envelope during their evolution ( young et al .",
    "2006 ) , in contrast to the population iii sne considered in this paper .",
    "we shall discuss the effect of the hydrogen envelope on the evolution of dust in the snr in   4 .",
    "the fates of dust grains within snrs heavily depend on their initial sizes @xmath0 as well as the chemical composition reflecting the difference in the sputtering yield and bulk density , as shown in figure 3 . for the standard model , the relatively small grains with @xmath87 @xmath4",
    "are efficiently decelerated due to the gas drag and are fully trapped into the hot plasma to be completely destroyed by the thermal sputtering .",
    "note that the gas drag on grains with small radii is more efficient than that on larger grains , because the deceleration rate of grain is inversely proportional to its size ( nkh06 ) .",
    "actually , the grains with the initial sizes less than 0.05 @xmath4 are trapped into the hot gas between the forward and reverse shocks and continue to be eroded by the thermal sputtering even at over @xmath24 yr until they are completely destroyed .",
    "larger grains of @xmath88 @xmath4 undergo the kinetic and thermal sputtering while streaming in the hot gas .",
    "thanks to the high bulk density , fe grains with @xmath89 @xmath4 are injected into the ism , reducing the size by 52 % . on the other hand , c and mg@xmath13sio@xmath35 grains with @xmath89 @xmath4 are trapped and eroded by the thermal sputtering in the denser region behind the forward shock , and their surface layers whose thicknesses are 43 and 69 % of their initial sizes are eroded , respectively , until @xmath90 yr when the snr enters into the radiative phase and the dense sn shell is formed behind the forward shock .",
    "these dust grains remain in the dense shell without further processing because the gas cools down quickly below @xmath25 k. thus , the decrease of sizes of these grains is truncated at a given size , and the erosion of dust with @xmath91 0.050.2 @xmath4 results in the final size of 0.0010.1 @xmath4 , depending on their initial sizes . for 1 @xmath4-sized c , mg@xmath13sio@xmath35 , and fe grains , the kinetic sputtering reduces their sizes by 0.7 , 6 , and 8 % , respectively .",
    "note that large grains with @xmath6 @xmath4 can go across even the forward shock and be injected into the ism , because the deceleration due to the gas drag is very inefficient .",
    "we should mention here that the degree of the erosion of dust is a complex function of the initial position and initial size of the dust as well as the sputtering yield .",
    "fe grains formed in the innermost he core and travelling through the oxygen - rich gas undergo the efficient erosion , since the sputtering yield by an oxygen ion is @xmath1450 times larger than that by a proton .",
    "in contrast , the degree of the erosion of c grains in the outermost he core is relatively small because they can quickly escape from the he core after the collision with the reverse shock and also have the sputtering yield lower than those of other dust species .",
    "furthermore , without being decelerated efficiently , the larger grains with the high velocities relative to gas are more efficiently eroded by sputtering in the relatively dense region near the forward shock front .",
    "however , the grains with the sizes larger than a given size can evade the erosion in the shocked hot gas within snrs and are expelled into the ism .",
    "although the processing of dust in the ism is not the main subject of this paper , here we shall simply show the processing of dust injected into the ism as a consequence of dust evolution in snrs .",
    "dust grains injected into the ism can be consumed through the kinetic sputtering because of the difference in velocity between the ambient cool gas and the dust grains , while the grains can be also decelerated by the direct collisions with the gas . in this case , the ratio of the final radius @xmath92 to the initial size @xmath0 of dust is dependent only on the escape velocity @xmath93 defined as the velocity with which dust is injected into the ism passing through the forward shock , and is given by @xmath94 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 is the average atomic mass of the elements sputtered from the grain , @xmath96 is the mean molecular weight of the gas , and @xmath97 is the sputtering yield at normal incidence by gas species @xmath98 whose number abundance is @xmath99 .",
    "figure 5 shows the results calculated by equation ( 1 ) for the primordial gas composition as a function of the escape velocity . in the calculations ,",
    "the final relative velocity @xmath100 is taken as 10 km s@xmath57 , which is small enough for dust grains not to be eroded by the kinetic sputtering .",
    "also we assume that the escape velocity equals to the initial velocity inside the he core , since very large grains are ejected to the ism with high velocities , not being decelerated efficiently .",
    "hence , the calculated @xmath92 gives the lower limit of the final size realized in the ism .",
    "the final size acquired by each dust species is different , depending on the sputtering yield @xmath101 and the average atomic mass @xmath95 , and decreases with increasing the escape velocity .",
    "the ratio of the final size to the initial size is @xmath750.8 for c grains with @xmath102 km s@xmath57 , @xmath750.5 for mg@xmath13sio@xmath35 grains with @xmath103 km s@xmath57 , and @xmath750.5 for fe grains with @xmath104 km s@xmath57 .",
    "thus , the sizes of very large grains supplied from sne are decreased to 0.50.8 times those at the time of the ejection , but are not completely destroyed in the ism .",
    "for pisne with the explosion energies higher than @xmath105 erg , the sizes of fe grains with the initial velocities of @xmath751000 km s@xmath57 decrease by 70 % in the ism , although the sizes of c and mg@xmath13sio@xmath35 grains whose initial velocities are in the range of 20003000 km s@xmath57 are not significantly different from those calculated for the standard model . note that dust grains in the ism are also processed by the high - velocity interstellar shocks driven by the ambient sne ( nkh06 ) , which is the major mechanism of the dust destruction in the ism .",
    "the results described in   3.2 imply that the size distribution of survived dust is greatly deficient in small - sized grains , compared with that at the time of dust formation . in figure 6 , we present the initial size distribution at the time of dust formation ( fig .",
    "6a ) and the size distribution of dust at the truncation time ( fig .",
    "6b ) for the standard model .",
    "the comparison of these figures clearly indicates that grains with the radii below a few tens   are missing for almost all dust species . in particular , al@xmath13o@xmath34 grains",
    "are completely destroyed because their initial sizes are smaller than 0.02 @xmath4 .",
    "we can also see that the sizes of the relatively large grains are shifted to small sizes due to the erosion by sputtering .",
    "it should be pointed out here that the size distribution of survived dust is different from that by bianchi & schneider ( 2007 ) : they have found that the final size distribution show a flattening towards smaller sizes without any abrupt truncation .",
    "the main reason of this difference is considered as follows .",
    "bianchi & schneider ( 2007 ) assumed that newly formed grains remain confined and trapped at their initial positions in the ejecta .",
    "therefore , dust grains remaining at their initial positions cease to be eroded by sputtering on the timescale of 48@xmath23 yr due to the decrease of the gas density caused by expansion . as shown in   3.2 , our results show that even small grains of @xmath106 @xmath4 penetrate into the hot plasma between the forward and reverse shocks , and are trapped and completely destroyed in the hot gas with the relatively high density . on the other hand , the erosion of grains with the radii of 0.050.2 @xmath4 produces the grains with the final sizes of 0.0010.1 @xmath4 remaining in the dense shell",
    ".    the critical size below which dust is destroyed is sensitive to the gas density in the ambient medium .",
    "although the critical size weakly depends on the dust species and their initial positions , we can roughly estimate the average critical size for different gas density in the ism . for @xmath107 @xmath2 ,",
    "the upper limit of the initial size of dust completely destroyed is @xmath140.01 @xmath4 , and the lower limit of that ejected to the ism is @xmath140.03 @xmath4 . for @xmath108 @xmath2 ,",
    "the grains with @xmath109 @xmath4 are destroyed , and the grains with @xmath110 @xmath4 are injected in the ism . note that the above critical sizes are true for the grain species except for c grains .",
    "the critical size of c grain is 0.006 , 0.02 , and 0.07 @xmath4 for @xmath1110.1 , 1 , and 10 @xmath2 , respectively , and is a few times smaller than other dust species , because c grains are located at the outermost he core and also have the lower erosion rate by sputtering .",
    "note that the initial sizes of fe grains injected into the ism are smaller than those of others by a factor of @xmath142 because of the high bulk density , and are @xmath190.02 , 0.1 , and 0.25 @xmath4 for @xmath1110.1 , 1 , and 10 @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , the critical size for each grain species is almost independent of the progenitor mass as long as the explosion energy of sn is the same , because the time evolution of temperature and density of gas within snrs is similar .",
    "for pisne with the explosion energies higher than @xmath105 erg and more massive hydrogen envelopes , the critical size increases approximately by a factor of three , compared with that for sne ii . however , the initial size of dust ejected to the ism is less than 2 times that for sne ii , because the high initial velocity inside the he core makes the dust grains easily escape from snrs .",
    "these results lead to the conclusion that the large - sized grains dominate the mass of dust injected from sne into the ism .",
    "tables 1 and 2 summarize the mass fraction of dust destroyed @xmath112 , piled up in the dense shell @xmath113 , and ejected to the ism @xmath114 for the unmixed and mixed grain models , respectively . in figures",
    "7a and 7b , we also present the total mass of survived dust for both grain models , respectively , along with their initial total mass .",
    "we can first see that the mass of dust destroyed increases with increasing the surrounding gas density .",
    "in particular , for @xmath115 @xmath2 , all or almost all ( @xmath1985 % ) of dust grains formed in the ejecta are destroyed , and the mass of survived dust is less than @xmath116 @xmath15 for all models considered in this paper .",
    "this reason is as follows ; the erosion of dust takes place in the hot gas between the forward and reverse shocks , whose density increases with the ambient gas density .",
    "therefore , the higher ism gas density leads to the efficient erosion and deceleration of dust through the more frequent collisions with the hot gas .",
    "next , we find that the mass fraction of dust destroyed is generally higher for the mixed grain model than the unmixed grain model ; for sne ii with @xmath117 1 ( 0.1 ) @xmath2 , @xmath118 0.50.8 ( 0.20.4 ) for the unmixed grain model , while @xmath119 0.90.99 ( 0.570.78 ) for the mixed grain model .",
    "this reflects the fact that the mixed grain model lacks the grains larger than 0.05 ( 0.01 ) @xmath4 in comparison with the unmixed grain model .",
    "finally , it can be seen that dust grains formed in pisne are more efficiently destroyed than those in sne ii , since the newly formed dust grains are dominated by the small - sized grains and the critical size is much larger .",
    "thus , for @xmath120 @xmath2 , the mass of dust survived in pisne is 0.11 @xmath15 for both grain models and is almost the same as that ( 0.070.5 @xmath15 ) in the sne ii , though the mass of dust formed in pisne is a few tens times higher than that in sne ii .",
    "note that the dust destruction by reverse shocks is more effective than that by high - velocity interstellar shocks for the dust grains with the same size distribution ( nkh06 ) .    the destruction efficiency defined as the ratio of the mass of dust destroyed to the initial dust mass",
    "is given in tables 3 and 4 for each dust species in the unmixed and mixed grain model , respectively .",
    "as mentioned above , the efficiency of dust destruction is greatly influenced by what fraction of the initial dust mass is occupied by the sizes larger than the critical size .",
    "thus , the destruction efficiency for a given dust species is very sensitive to the initial size distribution .",
    "note that it is difficult to find the clear dependence of the destruction efficiency of each dust species on the progenitor mass because the size distribution of dust at the time of dust formation is different from model to model .",
    "however , for example , the efficiency of destruction of al@xmath13o@xmath34 grain with @xmath121 @xmath4 is @xmath141 for almost all cases considered in this paper . for the unmixed grain model , fes and mgsio@xmath34 grains",
    "are also predominantly destroyed . on the other hand , fe , si ,",
    "and c grains for which most of the mass is locked into the grains larger than 0.05 @xmath4 have the relatively small destruction efficiencies . for the mixed grain model ,",
    "sio@xmath13 grains are the main dust species that are left in snrs and/or are injected into the ism .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the chemical composition , size distribution , and amount of dust grains supplied from sne to the ism are quite different from those at the time of dust formation .    here",
    "we shall discuss the dependence of the metallicity on the present results of calculations .",
    "first , it should be pointed out that the species of dust formed in the ejecta of sne ii and their size distributions are not sensitive to the metallicity of progenitor stars ( todini & ferrara 2001 ; nozawa 2003 ) .",
    "also the cooling function of gas for @xmath122 @xmath123 is independent of the metallicity ( sutherland & dopita 1993 ) .",
    "thus , the results of calculations presented in this paper can be directly applied to the evolution of dust in the ejecta of sne ii expanding into the ambient medium whose metallicity is less than 10@xmath124 @xmath123 .",
    "the increase of the metallicity in the ambient medium to the solar value greatly enhances the cooling of gas behind the forward shock and causes the time of the transition from nonradiative phase to radiative phase to be reduced to less than half of that for the zero - metallicity case . nevertheless , the destruction efficiency of each grain species for @xmath125 decreases at most by 15 % of that for @xmath126 .",
    "therefore , the results of present study could be useful for evaluating the dust evolution in snrs generated from sne ii , regardless of the initial metallicity of progenitor stars and ambient medium .",
    "however , as is demonstrated in the next section , the thickness of hydrogen envelope strongly affects the motion and destruction of dust within snrs .",
    "as mentioned in   3.2 , for the sne with the thick hydrogen envelopes , it takes at least more than 1000 yr for the reverse shocks to collide with the dust condensed inside the he core . on the other hand , the infrared observations of the cas a snr ( dwek et al .",
    "1987 ; lagage et al .",
    "1996 ; arendt et al . 1999 ; douvion et al . 2001 ; hines et al . 2004 ; ennis et al .",
    "2006 ) have revealed the thermal emission from warm dust formed in the ejecta at @xmath75330 yr after the explosion .",
    "this difference of the time at which dust grains inside the he core are swept up by the reverse shocks is attribute to the difference in the thickness of the hydrogen envelope of sne .",
    "therefore , in this section , we investigate the effect of the hydrogen envelope on the evolution of dust in the snr .    in order to illustrate the evolution of dust in the snr generated from the sn",
    "whose hydrogen envelope is very thin , we adopt the model of ejecta with @xmath69 @xmath15 from umeda & nomoto ( 2002 ) and modify it by artificially reducing the mass of the hydrogen envelope from 13 @xmath15 to 0.7 @xmath15 at the time of explosion . keeping the structure of the density , we simply scale up the gas velocity so that the explosion energy can equal to 10@xmath127 erg . we also assume the dust inside the he core is the same as that formed in primordial sn ii with @xmath69 @xmath15 .",
    "figure 8 illustrates the trajectories ( fig .",
    "8a ) and time evolutions of sizes ( fig .",
    "8b ) of c , mg@xmath13sio@xmath35 , and fe grains with @xmath91 0.01 and 0.1 @xmath4 in the snr calculated for @xmath111 1 @xmath2 .",
    "as can be expected , because the hydrogen envelope is very thin and the initial velocities of dust grains are very high ( 20005000 km s@xmath57 depending on their initial positions ) , the dust grains inside the he core collide with the reverse shock at much earlier time ; 120 yr for c grains , 570 yr for mg@xmath13sio@xmath35 grains , and 1300 yr for fe grains .",
    "contrary to sne ii with the thick hydrogen envelopes , even the grains with @xmath88 @xmath4 can be ejected to the ism without decreasing their sizes significantly ; c and mg@xmath13sio@xmath35 grains with @xmath88 @xmath4 reduce their sizes only by less than 6 % , while the sizes of fe grains with @xmath128 @xmath4 decrease by 18 % because the time staying in the hot gas is long , compared with c and mg@xmath13sio@xmath35 grains .",
    "the grains with @xmath129 @xmath4 are trapped into the hot gas and are completely destroyed . in this case , the critical size below which dust is completely destroyed is @xmath140.04 @xmath4 , and the lower limit of the initial size of dust supplied to the ism is @xmath140.04 @xmath4 which is five times smaller than that for a sn ii .",
    "therefore , the thin hydrogen envelope as well as the high initial velocity of dust causes almost all survived dust grains to be injected into the ism without being trapped into the gas within the snr .",
    "the mass fraction of dust destroyed is 0.38 , which is lower than 0.75 for the standard model , and thus more dust grains are supplied to the ism .",
    "the result of calculation shows that the fates of dust grains formed in the ejecta strongly depend on the thickness of the hydrogen envelope .",
    "however , we adopt the model of dust formed in a sn ii and also consider the uniform ambient medium .",
    "the significant mass loss of massive stars during their evolution results in the circumstellar medium that is not uniform and homogeneous .",
    "in addition , the time evolution of the temperature and density of gas in the ejecta of sne without the hydrogen envelopes such as type ib / c sne is expected to be different from that in sne ii , which influences the dust formation in the ejecta .",
    "therefore , we must clarify the size distribution and amount of dust grains formed in the ejecta to investigate the dependence of the evolution of dust on the type of sne .",
    "this subject will be reported in the forthcoming paper .",
    "some extremely metal - poor ( emp ) stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath130 discovered in the galactic halo have peculiar abundance patterns showing the modest or large ( 1100 times ) enhancements of c , n , o , mg , and si relative to solar ( venkatesan et al . 2006 and references therein ) . in particular , two hyper metal - poor ( hmp ) stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath131 , he 0107 - 5240 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath132 , christlieb et al . 2002 ) and he 1327 - 2326 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath133 , frebel et al .",
    "2005 ) show extreme ( @xmath1910@xmath134 times ) overabundances of c , n , and o relative to iron .",
    "because the elemental composition of hmp stars expected to be the very early generation may strongly reflect the nucleosynthesis in population iii stars , several scenarios have been proposed to explain the origin of elemental abundances in low - mass hmp stars ; the mixing fall - back in a core - collapse sn ( umeda & nomoto 2005 ; iwamoto et al .",

    "2004 ) .",
    "recently , venkatesan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have proposed that emp stars are the second - generation stars formed in the dense shell of primordial snrs and their peculiar abundances can be reproduced by the segregated transport of newly formed dust decoupled from the metal - rich gas in sne . adopting the dust models by todini & ferrara ( 2001 ) and schneider et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , they calculated the sputtering and the transport of dust driven by the uv radiation field from the stellar cluster within a snr .",
    "they have conclude that the progenitor mass range of 10150 @xmath15 qualitatively explains the enhancement of the elements composing dust grains ( c , o , mg , and si ) in emp stars , though they did not compare their results with the abundance data on these metal - poor stars .",
    "the results of the transportation and destruction of dust given in   3.2 show that all dust grains remaining in primordial snrs without being completely destroyed by sputtering can be accumulated in the dense sn shell at @xmath1410@xmath13510@xmath136 yr after the explosion .",
    "thus , it is considered that the formation of the second - generation stars with solar mass scales could be possible in the shell contaminated with dust grains , as is investigated by schneider et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . in this case",
    ", we can expect that the elemental compositions of dust grains piled up into the dense shell reflect the metal abundance patterns of the second - generation stars .",
    "the iron - bearing dust species including the most important element fe are fe and fes grains for the unmixed grain model , and fe@xmath34o@xmath35 grain for the mixed grain model .",
    "note that c grains can not be formed in the mixed ejecta because the ejecta is oxygen - rich , and fe@xmath34o@xmath35 grains with @xmath137 @xmath4 are dominantly destroyed in the postshock flow and are rarely accumulated in the sn shell for @xmath111 1 and 10 @xmath2 .",
    "hence , we show only the results calculated for the unmixed grain model . in addition , fe and fes grains are not significantly piled up in the shell of pisn remnants , since most of them are completely destroyed or are injected into the ism .",
    "thus , we focus on the results for type ii snrs",
    ".    the abundances of c , o , mg , and si relative to fe in the dense shell are summarized in tables 5 , where we neglect the contribution of metal atoms sputtered from the grains crossing the dense shell because the largest - sized grains are only eroded by less than 1% of their radii .",
    "the hydrogen mass in the dense sn shell @xmath138 at the truncation time is given in table 1 .",
    "it can be seen from table 5 that all models considered here predict the value of [ fe / h ] less than @xmath139 , and most of them exhibit the value of [ fe / h ] ranging from @xmath140 to @xmath141 .",
    "thus , two hmp stars are considered to be formed in the dense shell of primordial snrs . among the 9 models with @xmath142 [ fe / h ] @xmath143 , the abundances of mg and si are in the range of @xmath144 [ mg / fe ] @xmath145 and @xmath146 [ si / fe ] @xmath147 , respectively , and 8 models can produce the overabundances of mg and/or si .",
    "this result suggests that the dust formed in the unmixed ejecta of sne ii can be responsible for the peculiar abundance patterns of mg and si in hmp stars .",

    "<S> we investigate the evolution of dust that formed at population iii supernova ( sn ) explosions and its processing through the collisions with the reverse shocks resulting from the interaction of the sn ejecta with the ambient medium . </S>",

    "<S> we find that the evolution of the reverse shock , and hence its effect on the processing of the dust depends on the thickness of the envelope retained by the progenitor star . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the transport and survival of the dust grains depend on their initial radius , @xmath0 , and composition : for type ii snrs expanding into the interstellar medium ( ism ) with a density of @xmath1 @xmath2 , small grains with @xmath3 @xmath4 are completely destroyed by sputtering in the postshock flow , while grains with @xmath5 0.050.2 @xmath4 are trapped into the dense shell behind the forward shock </S>",
    "<S> . very large grains of @xmath6 @xmath4 are ejected into the ism without decreasing their sizes significantly . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the total mass fraction of dust that is destroyed by the reverse shock ranges from 0.2 to 1.0 , depending on the energy of the explosion and the density of the ambient ism . </S>",
    "<S> the results of our calculations have significant impact on the abundance pattern of subsequent generation of stars that form in the dense shell of primordial snrs . </S>"
