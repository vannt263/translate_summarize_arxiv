    "in principle , it is pretty difficult to specify the oscillation parameters in neutrino oscillation reliably from the cosmic ray experiments ( atmospheric neutrinos ) , even if they really exist , because in the cosmic ray experiment by its nature , one can not determine the direction of the incident neutrino which plays a decisive role in the analysis of neutrino oscillation and may be determined in the accelerator experiments even if the experimental errors are so large due to their geometries .",
    "+ on the other hand , according to the results obtained from the super - kamiokande experiments on atmospheric neutrinos , it is said that oscillation phenomena have been found between two neutrinos , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "published reports on the confirmation to the oscillation between the neutrinos , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and the history foregoing these experiments will be critically reviewed and details are in the following :    * during 1980 s kamiokande and imb observed the smaller atmospheric neutrino flux ratio @xmath3 than the predicted value @xcite .",
    "* kamiokande found anomaly in the zenith angle distribution @xcite . *",
    "super - kamiokande found @xmath1-@xmath2 oscillation @xcite and soudan2 and macro confirmed the super - kamiokande result @xcite .",
    "* k2k , the first accelerator - based long baseline experiment , confirmed atmospheric neutrino oscillation@xcite . *",
    "minos s precision measurement gives the consistent results with super - kamiokande ones@xcite .",
    "it is well known that super - kamiokande collaboration examined all possible types of the neutrino events , such as , say , sub - gev e - like , multi - gev e - like , sub - gev @xmath4-like , multi - gev @xmath4-like , multi - ring sub - gev @xmath4-like , multi - ring multi - gev @xmath4-like , _ upward stopping muon events _ and _ upward through going muon events_. in other words , all possible interactions by neutrinos , such as , elastic and quasielastic scatterings , single - meson production and deep scattering are considered in their analyses . as the results of them , all topologically different types of neutrino events lead to the unified numerical oscillation parameters , say , @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "really , these parameters are obtained from the unified analysis of the zenith angle distributions of various neutrino events . as for reliability of the energy estimation which plays a decisively important role in the survival probability of a given flavor , the qualities of the events range in various grades from the coarse to the fine . generally , it is impossible to estimate the individual energy of the muon due to the neutrino interaction among _ partially contained events _ due to their stochastic characters . in the multi - ring events ,",
    "energy estimations has much uncertainty , even if they belong to _ fully contained events_. moreover , it is absolutely impossible to estimate energy of the individual event in _ upward going muon events_.    consequently , in spite of such a fatal defect for the detection of the neutrino oscillation , which is inherent in the cosmic ray experiments as mentioned above , if one goes ahead and challenges to prove the existence of the neutrino oscillation in cosmic ray experiments , then , one should focus on analysis of the most reliable events with the highest quality exclusively from the experimental point of view , discarding all other physical events which have uncertainties more or less compared with the events with the highest quality .",
    "such the most reliable events among all candidates to be analyzed for super - kamiokande collaboration are _ fully contained events _ among the single ring muon events due to the quasi elastic scattering ( qel ) .",
    "these events occupy the majority among _ fully contained events _ observed by super - kamiokande collaboration . by the definition of",
    "fully contained events of the single ring events due to qel , one can discriminate kinds of neutrinos and can estimate their transferred energies because of their confinement in the detector as well as their zenith angles which are strongly connected with their emitted angles in the neutrino interactions concerned . if one can find some clear indication on the neutrino oscillation from the analysis of the most reliable events with the highest quality , then , one can surely expect any corroboration on the neutrino oscillation from the analysis of neutrino events with poorer qualities , if they really exist .",
    "this is our motivation for the performance of our computer numerical experiment .    here",
    ", it should be emphasized strongly that super - kamiokande collaboration put a fundamental assumption through their whole analyses .",
    "this assumption , however , is never self - evident and , therefore , it should be carefully examined .",
    "this assumption is that the directions of the incident neutrinos are approximately the same as those of emitted leptons , which we abbreviate as _ the sk assumption on the direction _ in the present paper .",
    "this assumption should be recognized as the cornerstone for their neutrino oscillation analysis throughout all their works , which links with the survival probability of a given flavor , @xmath7 given by @xmath8    where @xmath9 and @xmath10@xcite .",
    "the most important result among the achievements on neutrino oscillation made by super - kamiokande collaboration is the finding of the maximum oscillation in neutrino oscillation , because it is the ultimate result in the sense that they observe the oscillation pattern itself directly in neutrino oscillation .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to carry out careful @xmath0 analysis for the single ring muon events due to qel ( the events with the highest quality ) among _ fully contained events _ exclusively in order to obtain a definite conclusion around the neutrino oscillation , focusing on the validity ( or invalidity ) of _ the sk assumption on the direction_. consequently , let us examine _ the sk assumption on the direction_. this is the main theme of the present paper ( part  1 ) . in a subsequent paper ( part  2 ) , we discuss the application of the result obtained in part  1 to the analysis for the single ring muon events due to qel among _ fully contained events _ , concluding the invalidity of _ the sk assumption on the direction _ through @xmath0 analysis .    in order to avoid any misunderstanding toward _ the sk assumption on the direction _ , we reproduce this assumption from the original sk papers and their related papers in italic .",

    "the scattering angle of the emitted muon for 5 gev neutrino is relatively small ( see , table 1 ) , so that the emitted muons keep roughly the same direction as their original neutrinos . in this case , the effect of their azimuthal angle on the zenith angle is also smaller .",
    "however , in the case for 0.5 gev which is the dominant energy for single ring muon events in the super - kamiokande , there is even a possibility for the emitted muon to be emitted in the backward direction due to the larger angle scattering , the effect of which is enhanced by their azimuthal angle .",

    "sk in the figures denotes _ the sk assumption on the direction _ of incident neutrinos . from the figures  [ figh007](a ) to [ figh009](c ) , it is clear that the scattering angles of emitted muons influence their zenith angles , which is enhanced by their azimuthal angles , particularly for more inclined directions of the incident neutrinos .",
    "\\(a ) ( b ) ( c )     +      in the previous sections , we discuss the relation between the zenith angle distribution of the incident neutrino with a definite energy and that of the emited muons produced by the neutrino for the different incident direction .",
    "in order to apply our inspection around the uncertainty of _ the sk assumption on the direction _ for _ fully contained events _ to the real situation , we must consider the effect of the energy spectrum of the incident neutrino .",
    "the monte carlo simulation procedures for this purpose are given in appendix b.    in fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] , we give the zenith angle distributions of the sum of @xmath55 and @xmath56 for a given zenith angle of @xmath57 and @xmath1 , taking into account different primary neutrino energy spectra for different directions at kamioka site .",
    "sk in the figures denotes _ the sk assumption on the direction_. from the figures , it is clear that _ the sk assumption on the direction _ does not hold .",
    "namely , we can conclude that the scattering angle of the emitted muons acompanied by their azimuthal angles influence their zenith angle distribution for all directions .",
    "now , we extend the results for the definite zenith angle obtained in the previous sections to the case in which we consider the zenith angle distribution of the incident neutrinos totally . here , we examine the real correlation between @xmath58 and @xmath59 , by performing the exact monte carlo simulation .    the detail for the simulation procedure is given in appendix c.    in order to obtain the zenith angle distribution of the emitted leptons for that of the incident neutrinos , we divide the range of cosine of the zenith angle of the incident neutrino into twenty regular intervals from @xmath60 to @xmath61 . for the given interval of @xmath62 , we carry out the exact monte carlo simulation , and obtain the cosine of the zenith angle of the emitted leptons .    thus , for each interval of @xmath62 , we obtain the corresponding zenith angle distribution of the emitted leptons .",
    "then , we sum up these corresponding ones over all zenith angles of the incident neutrinos and we finally obtain the relation between the zenith angle distribution for the incident neutrinos and that for the emitted leptons .    in a similar manner , we could obtain between @xmath63 and @xmath64 for anti - neutrinos . the situation for anti - neutrinos",
    "is essentially the same as that for neutrinos .",
    "super - kamiokande collaboration have made the comprehensive analysis of the all possible types of the neutrino events on the neutrino oscillations @xcite for 1489.2 live days .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the neutrino events due to qel to make uncertainties around the interpretation small as possible .    in figure  [ figr011 ] , we give the correlation diagram between @xmath58 and @xmath65 for 1489.2 live days without oscillation . here , we classify the correlations with regard to different incident neutrino energies .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ figr011 ] that the neutrino events for @xmath66 5  gev exist on the line @xmath67 roughly , and the neutrino events for 2  @xmath68  5  gev exist along the line @xmath67 with explicit deviations .",
    "namely , in higher neutrino energy regions , _ the sk assumption on the direction _ roughly holds .",
    "however , if we pay our attention to lower energies , for 1  @xmath68  2  gev , we easily understand that their distribution deviates largely from the line @xmath67 , showing clearly that _ the sk assumption on the direction _ does not hold .",
    "consequently , in sum , we can conclude that _ the sk assumption on the direction _ does not hold as a whole , taking account of the fact that lower energy neutrino events occupy the majority in the detector due to the strong steepness of the incident neutrino energy spectra . in figure  [ figr012 ] ,",
    "we give the correlation diagram between @xmath58 and @xmath65 for 1489.2 live days with oscillation . the monte carlo simulation with oscillation",
    "is carried out with the use of the rejection method with regard to the survival probability for a given flavor , which is based on the results obtained by the monte carlo simulation without oscillation .",
    "the regions in the correlation diagrams in figures  [ figr011 ] and [ figr012 ] are divided into the four parts , each of which have their own physical meaning .",
    "the neutrino events in the first sector where @xmath69 and @xmath70 consist of the upward neutrinos and upward muons .",
    "namely , this denotes such a situation that the upward neutrinos emit the muons in forward directions .",
    "the neutrino events in the second sector where @xmath71 and @xmath70 consist of the downward neutrinos and the upward muons .",
    "namely , this denotes such a situation that downward neutrinos emit the muons in backward directions .",
    "the neutrino events in the third sector where @xmath71 and @xmath72 consist of the downward neutrino and the downward muons .",
    "namely , this denotes such a situation that the downward neutrinos emit the muons in forward directions .",
    "the neutrino events in the fourth sector where @xmath69 and @xmath72 consist of the upward neutrinos and the downward muons .",
    "namely , this denotes such a situation that the upward neutrinos emit the muons in backward directions .    here , the downward muons are generated in three different manners . in the first case",
    ", they are generated by downward neutrinos . in the second case ,",
    "they are generated by upward neutrinos , owing to the backscattering in qel . and",
    "in the third case , they are generated by either upward or downward horizontal - like neutrinos . in the last case , either upward or downward",
    "horizontal - like neutrinos may produce downward muons due to the accidental azimuthal effect in qel.(see , figure 3b ) .",
    "the upward muons are generated in three different manners similarly by both upward and downward neutrinos .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ figr011 ] that events in the first sector are symmetrical to those in the third sector , while events in the second sector are symmetrical to those in the forth sector .",
    "as we expect the same incident neutrino fluxes in both downward and upward directions in the case of no oscillation , these symmetries are should be hold , as it must be .",
    "on the other hand , it is clear from figure  [ figr012 ] that symmetries found in figure  [ figr011 ] are lost any more .",
    "this comes from that the upward neutrino flux is smaller than that of the downward neutrino in the case of the existence of oscillation .    in figure",
    "[ figr013 ] , we give the events which exist in the case of no oscillation but disappear due to oscillation obtained through the monte carlo operational procedure by the survival probability of a given flavor ( eq.(1 ) ) .",
    "it is simply obtained by the subtraction of the events in figure  [ figr012 ] from the events in figure  [ figr011 ] .",
    "we can obtain several interesting results from figure  [ figr013 ] .",
    "the first is that we do not find disappeared ( rejected ) events in the downward neutrino events due to oscillation .",
    "this reason is very simple and clear .",
    "it is due to the extreme low probability of oscillation for downward neutrino with the statistics considered on the occasion of the selection of the specified neutrino oscillation paremeters by super - kamiokande collaboration , say @xmath5 .",
    "when we adopt this value one order of magnitude larger than sk s , @xmath73 , we surely expect the events concerned for the downward neutrinos . furthermore , when we adopt this value one order of magnitude smaller than sk s , @xmath74 , then we surely expect different distribution of the events concerned even for the upward neutrinos , keeping the absence of the events concerned for downward neutrinos .",
    "the second is that almost disappeared ( rejected ) events belong to the first sector ( upward neutrinos @xmath75 upward muons ) .",
    "the third is that we can not neglect disappeared ( rejected ) neutrino events which belong to the forth sector ( upward neutrino @xmath75 downward muon ) .      in the previous subsection , we verify that _ the sk assumption on the direction _ does not hold from the examination on the correlatin between @xmath58 and @xmath65 .",
    "this sk assumption on @xmath58 and @xmath65 is logically equivalent to the statement that @xmath76 is approximately the same as @xmath77 in @xmath0 analysis , where @xmath76 denotes the distance on the incident neutrino from the interaction point of the neutrino events to the intersection of the earth surface toward its arriving direction and @xmath77 denotes the corresponding distance on the emitted muon .",
    "consequently , if our indication on the invalidity of _ the sk assumption on the direction _ on @xmath58 and @xmath65 is correct , the same conclusion should be drawn from the correlation between @xmath76 and @xmath77 . in the present subsection , we directly examine the validity of the implicit sk assumption that @xmath76 is approximated by @xmath77 , taking consideration of the neutrino energy spectrum at the super - kamiokande site .",
    "the relation between @xmath76 and @xmath77 is given in figure  [ figh010 ] . also , we show the procedure to determine @xmath77 for a given @xmath76 in figure  [ figh011 ] .",

    "it should be noticed that the @xmath76 and @xmath77 are regulated by both the energy spectrum of the incident neutrino and the production spectrum of the muon ( qel in the present case ) .",
    "consequently , their mutual relation is influenced by either the absence of oscillation or the presence of oscillation which depend on the combination of oscillation parameters .    in figures",

    "neutrino events consist of those with backscattering and/or neutrino events in which the neutrino directions are horizontally downward ( upward ) , but their produced muons turn upward ( downward ) resulting from the effect of azimuthal angles in qel .    in the @xmath0 analysis made by super - kamiokande collaboration",

    "again , we should emphasize and confirm that `` reconstruction of the direction of the incident neutrino '' in @xmath0 analysis of super - kamiokande collaboration is just equal to the adoption of the direction of the emitted muon due to the neutrino interaction .      here",

    "the idea that @xmath90 can be approximated as the polynomial of @xmath91 means that there should be the unique relation between @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",

    "( b ) , we give the correlation between @xmath90 and @xmath91 with oscillation . glancing at figures  [ figh014 ]  ( a ) and ( b ) , we can not recognize the difference between them , because too much events are marked on the figure for their discrimination .",
    "then in figure  [ figh014 ]  ( c ) , we give the subtraction between them , as shown in figures  [ figr013 ] and [ figr015 ] .",
    "it is easily understood that there is the visible difference between them .",
    "furthermore , it is easily understood from figures  [ figh014 ] that the polynomial expression is not suitable for the description on the mutual relation between @xmath90 and @xmath91 , standing on the stochastic point of view .",
    "finally , it is necessary to mention to the qualitative difference between the correlation between @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and the correlation between @xmath90 and @xmath91 , from the degree of their influence on _ the sk assumption on the direction_. as clarified in figures  [ figh012 ] and [ figh013 ] , it is impossible to approximate as @xmath76 nearly equal to @xmath77 ( @xmath94 ) . on the other hand , the approximation of @xmath90 by eq.(7 ) does not introduce fatal error finally , although its treatment is not theoretically suitable in the sense of the lack of stochastic characters on the physical processes .",
    "namely , what influences on the @xmath0 analysis essentially is the correlation between @xmath76 and @xmath77 , but not the correlation between @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "since one can not measure @xmath76 and @xmath90 , one is forced to utilize @xmath77 and @xmath91 in the @xmath0 analysis in place of them .",

    "<S> it should be regarded that the confirmation of the maximum oscillation in neutrino oscillation through @xmath0 analysis by super - kamiokande is a logical consequence of their establishment on the existence of neutrino oscillation through the analysis of the zenith angle distribution for atmospheric neutrino events . in the present paper ( part  1 ) with the computer numerical experiment </S>",
    "<S> , we examine the assumption made by super - kamiokande collaboration that the direction of the incident neutrino is approximately the same as that of the produced lepton , which is the cornerstone in their @xmath0 analysis , and we find this approximation does not hold even approximately . in a subsequent paper ( part  2 ) , we apply the results from figures 16 , 17 , 18 and 19 to @xmath0 analysis and conclude that one can not obtain the maximum oscillation in @xmath0 analysis in the single ring muon events due to quasi - elastic scattering reported by super - kamiokande which shows strongly the oscillation pattern from the neutrino oscillation .    </S>",
