    "the strange matter , containing the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 quarks , has been considered to be the ground state of qcd @xcite , and expected to play an important role in the astrophysical phenomena such as the quark stars and the early universe .",
    "it is also interesting that droplets of the strange matter ( strangelets ) could be a candidate of the dark matter .",
    "there is also a possibility to observe strangelets in the relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "whereas the physics of the quark matter is interesting in many respects , it is difficult to describe its properties directly from qcd . until now , the stability of the strange matter has been discussed by using effective models of qcd . in the early stage ,",
    "the mit bag model was often used with an assumption that the strange matter could be treated as a system of free fermi gas in a bag @xcite . there , the strange matter became stable than the @xmath5 quark matter due to the large number of the degrees of freedom by including the strangeness . in these works ,",
    "not only the bulk quark matter , but also the strangelet of finite size has also been studied .",
    "it was then shown that the strangelets could be more stable than the normal nuclei .",
    "however , in the mit bag model , an important feature of qcd is not incorporated , that is the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "in fact , when it is taken into account , it has been shown that the strange matter can not be absolutely stable @xcite .",
    "the pattern of chiral symmetry restoration in the finite density quark matter is different for the @xmath5 quarks and the @xmath4 quarks . the chiral symmetry for the @xmath5 quarks is sufficiently restored at stable densities ( @xmath6 ) , while that for the @xmath4 quarks is still largely broken .",
    "then , the transition from the @xmath5 quark matter to the strange matter by weak process is disfavored because of the large dynamical quark mass in the strange quark sector .",
    "this result is qualitatively very different from the results of the absolute stability obtained in the mit bag model , in which only current quark masses are used .",
    "though the strange matter of infinite volume was discussed by taking into account dynamical chiral symmetry breaking @xcite , the strangelet with finite volume is not discussed yet . in this paper , we study the stability of the strangelet by considering dynamical chiral symmetry breaking . in section 2",
    ", we formulate the lagrangian to describe dynamical chiral symmetry breaking supplemented by the confinement which is treated approximately by a boundary condition . in section 3 ,",
    "numerical results are shown and we discuss the stability of the strangelet and present several observables . in section 4 , we conclude our discussions .",
    "we consider the njl model with a four - point quark interaction @xcite .",
    "this interaction is responsible for the dynamical generation of the quark mass . for a finite system of strangelet",
    ", we also have to consider that quarks are confined in a cavity with finite volume . to incorporate the latter aspect",
    ", we introduce the boundary condition of the mit bag model .",
    "therefore , our model lagrangian for the strangelet is given by @xcite @xmath7                          - \\bar{\\psi}m\\theta(r\\!-\\!r)\\psi , \\label{eq : njl_bag}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the quark field and @xmath9 current mass matrix .",

    "it is well known that the last term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : njl_bag ] ) breaks chiral symmetry explicitly at the bag surface . in order to recover chiral symmetry there ,",
    "we need to introduce the chiral field ( pion ) which is coupled to the quarks at the bag boundary .",
    "this leads to the condition of the chiral bag model , in which the pion cloud exists around the bag , and the vacuum structure is modified in the bag due to the strong pion - quark coupling which is known as the chiral casimir effect @xcite .",
    "although , this property associated with the pion field does not appear explicitly in our model lagrangian eq .",
