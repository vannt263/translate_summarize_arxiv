    "in this paper we present a realistic and natural supersymmetric grand - unified theory ( susy - gut ) based on the gauge group so(10 ) . by a natural susy - gut we mean one that satisfies the following three conditions .",
    "( 1 ) the doublet - triplet splitting ( or `` 2/3 splitting '' ) of the higgs multiplet does not involve artificial cancellations or `` fine - tuning '' of parameters ; ( 2 ) the superpotential has the most general form allowed by some symmetry principle ; and ( 3 ) local symmetry prevents the appearance in the effective sub - planck - scale theory of higher dimension operators that would disrupt the gauge hierarchy .    in a previous paper@xmath0 we explored an elegant mechanism , proposed originally in 1981 by dimopoulos and wilczek,@xmath1 which achieves the 2/3 splitting without artificial cancellations or fine tuning .",
    "there we showed that this mechanism makes possible a simple suppression of proton decay coming from the dimension - five operators mediated by the exchange of the color - triplet higgsinos , while at the same time preserving the wonderfully successful susy - gut prediction@xmath2 of @xmath3 .",
    "the dimopoulos - wilczek ( dw ) mechanism , which accomplishes all this , calls for the group so(10 ) rather than su(5 ) or flipped su(5)@xmath4 @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "so(10 ) has long been regarded as an especially attractive gauge group for grand unification@xmath6 for a number of other reasons as well .",
    "( a ) it unifies a whole family into a single irreducible representation .",
    "( b ) it is automatically anomaly free .",
    "( c ) it completes each family with a right - handed neutrino . and ( d )",
    ", it automatically builds in `` matter parity '' , since quarks and leptons are in spinors and higgs fields are in tensors of so(10 ) .",
    "[ matter parity is a @xmath7 subgroup of the @xmath8 center of so(10 ) , whereas the centers of su(5 ) and @xmath9 do not contain matter parity . ]    in reference 1 it was not shown that the dw mechanism is natural in the strong sense which is used in this paper and which is defined above .",
    "while it was shown that 2/3 splitting is achieved without artificial cancellations ( condition 1 ) , the superpotentials studied in ref .",
    "1 were the most general allowed by some symmetry ( condition 2 ) ; rather , certain terms were simply left out .",
    "this is certainly natural in the weaker sense that the non - renormalization theorems of supersymmetry would prevent such omitted terms from being induced by radiative corrections , but it is nevertheless arbitrary . in section 2",
    "we present an so(10 ) model which satisfies the first two naturalness conditions .",
    "this model is quite simple ( simpler than those studied in ref . 1 ) and",
    "perhaps even a minimal so(10 ) susy - gut .",
    "we treat the problem of studying the third naturalness condition in section 3 .",
    "the reason we treat this separately is that it is unknown whether planck - scale physics does in fact induce all possible higher - dimension operators ( not forbidden by local symmetry ) in the effective sub - planck- scale lagrangian,@xmath10 and , if so , how large their coefficients might be .",
    "conceivably there could be some tremendous suppression that would make it unnecessary to worry about these effects at all . in section 3 , however , we will make the most pessimistic assumption that such operators are suppressed only by the dimensionally appropriate powers of the planck mass : that is , that they are as large as they can be . even under this assumption it is shown that a straightforward extension of the model of section 2 which is only slightly more complicated can prevent any disruption of the gauge hierarchy by planck - scale physics .    in the models of both sections 2 and 3 the symmetries imposed to make the gauge hierarchy natural are closely akin to peccei - quinn symmetries@xmath11 and in fact lead automatically to the existence of an invisible axion .",
    "this is not completely surprising , since the terms that have to be prevented are those that would produce a large @xmath12-parameter , and it is well - known that a @xmath12-parameter can be prevented by a peccei - quinn symmetry.@xmath13 however , we find it significant that a natural gauge hierarchy in so(10 ) may not only require the existence of an axion but that in fact the local symmetry that may be needed to protect the hierarchy from planck - scale - induced higher - dimensional operators may protect the axion from such effects as well.@xmath14 this will be discussed in section 4 .    finally , there is the question of realistic quark and lepton masses .",
    "the question is how to avoid the `` bad '' predictions of so(10 ) , namely that the up and down quark mass matrices are proportional @xmath15 and that @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the prediction @xmath18 is , of course , the `` good '' one ; and so",
    "the obvious and common suggestion is that higher order effects disturb the relations involving the lighter generations .",
    "it turns out that this suggestion is easy to implement in the context of the ideas discussed here .",
    "in fact these ideas lend themselves very well to a promising approach to the quark and lepton mass puzzle that has already been advocated in the literature.@xmath19 this will be discussed in section 5 . in section 6",
    "we will summarize our results and conclusions .",
    "consider a supersymmetric so(10 ) model with chiral superfields in the following representations : three * 16 * s of quarks and leptons @xmath20 , and higgs fields that are in two * 10 * s @xmath21 , three * 45 * s @xmath22 , a * 54 * @xmath23 , a @xmath24 @xmath25 and a * 126 * @xmath26 .",
    "let there also be a @xmath27 discrete symmetry under which the fields transform as in table i. then the most general so(10)@xmath28-invariant , renormalizable superpotential is given by    @xmath29    we assume that the dimensionless couplings , @xmath30 , that appear in w are of order one and that the mass parameters are of order @xmath31 .",
    "( as will be seen shortly , however , @xmath32 must be slightly less than @xmath33  about @xmath34  in order to suppress proton decay . )",
    "consequently , the vevs of @xmath35 , and @xmath36 will be of order @xmath37 .",
    "the function of each term in @xmath38 is easily understood .",
    "@xmath39 is to give mass to the quarks and leptons : @xmath40 gives dirac mass to the light fermions and @xmath41 gives majorana masses to the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "( of course , by themselves the terms displayed in @xmath39 would not give a realistic pattern of masses , as noted in the introduction .",
    "some attractive and economical ideas for improving this situation are considered in section 5 . )",
    "@xmath42 contains the light higgs doublets , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , of the supersymmetric standard model as well as their color - triplet partners , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , that must be made superheavy .",
    "this is the well - known 2/3 splitting referred to in the introduction , which here is accomplished by the dimopoulos - wilczek sector , @xmath47 .",
    "the vev of the adjoint , @xmath48 , is assumed to have the dw form , @xmath49 .",
    "thus the color - triplets in @xmath42 and @xmath50 have a mass matrix of the form    @xmath51    which makes all of them superheavy , as @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 are all of or near the gut scale , @xmath31 .",
    "the doublets , on the other hand , have a mass matrix ( ignoring weak - scale effects ) of the form    @xmath55    so that the @xmath56 and the @xmath57 in @xmath42 are light , as required .",
    "higgsino - mediated proton decay happens through the diagram in fig .",
    "1 . this gives a proton - decay amplitude proportional to @xmath58 , as can be seen directly by inverting the mass matrix in eq .",
    "thus the proton - decay rate from colored - higgsino exchange has a suppression factor @xmath59 ^ 2 $ ] which allows a comfortable consistency with present experimental limits if @xmath60 is about @xmath61 .",
    "this is what is called `` weak suppression '' of proton decay in ref . 1 .",
    "[ the color - triplet higgsinos in the @xmath24 multiplet can , in general , also induce proton decay , with an amplitude proportional to the neutrino majorana mass matrix . however , this does not happen in the present model , since @xmath27 prevents terms such as @xmath62 and since the color - triplet in @xmath63 does not mix with the color - triplets in @xmath42 or @xmath50 . ]",
    "the purpose of @xmath64 is to give the required dw form to @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "if @xmath67 and @xmath68 then @xmath69 gives    @xmath70    one solution is @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the @xmath73 equation then forces @xmath74 where @xmath75 so that @xmath66 also has the dw form .",
    "the magnitude of the combination @xmath76 is fixed by the @xmath77 equation , but the individual magnitudes of @xmath53 and @xmath78 are not determined until susy is broken , when the soft terms @xmath79 and @xmath80 , whose coefficients are both of order @xmath81 , will set @xmath82 .",
    "the form of @xmath64 differs in a very significant way from the form considered by srednicki in ref .",
    "11 and adopted in ref .",
    "the srednicki form is @xmath83 . here",
    "@xmath84 has been replaced by @xmath85 .",
    "the reason for this is the necessity of ruling out an @xmath86 term , which would destroy the gauge hierarchy by making all the higgs doublets superheavy .",
    "( this is just a @xmath12-term with @xmath12 of order @xmath33 . )",
    "the connection with the form of @xmath64 is seen through fig .",
    "2 . the point of fig .",
    "2 is not that this diagram itself is large  in fact , due to the non - renormalization theorems of susy , it will be suppressed by the susy - breaking scale and not endanger the gauge hierarchy .",
    "rather , the point is that if such a diagram can be drawn it implies that no symmetry of the theory forbids a @xmath87 term , and therefore , notwithstanding the non - renormalization theorems that allow this term to be omitted , it is unnatural in the sense of our second condition to leave it out . the vertex @xmath88 that appears in fig .",
    "2 is a necessary ingredient of the dw mechanism , and the term @xmath89 is required if there are not to be * two * pairs of light higgs doublets , which would be very bad for @xmath90.@xmath0 thus any hope of preventing the @xmath87 term by symmetry requires the vertex @xmath91 which appears in fig . 2 not to exist .",
    "hence our replacement of it by @xmath92 .",
    "the effect of having only the combination @xmath85 appear , required to forbid @xmath87 , is that the model has an `` accidental '' peccei - quinn symmetry under which @xmath93 , and @xmath94 .",
    "the resulting axion is invisible , as @xmath95 .",
    "this will be discussed further in section 4 .",
    "the @xmath96 sector generates su(5)-singlet vevs for @xmath97 , and @xmath36 that break the rank of so(10 ) down to that of the standard model and gives right - handed - neutrino masses .",
    "@xmath64 and @xmath96 together break so(10 ) @xmath98 .    as explained in ref",
    ". 1 , the term @xmath99 couples the @xmath100 and @xmath101 sectors together in such a way as to prevent goldstone bosons without destabilizing the dw form of @xmath65 and @xmath102 .",
    "the model given in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is close to being a minimal realistic and natural so(10 ) susy - gut .",
    "it breaks so(10 ) completely to the standard model , avoids extra light fields ( goldstone or otherwise ) that would disturb @xmath103 , gives natural 2/3 splitting , allows higgsino - mediated proton decay to be suppressed , and produces quark and lepton masses and the see - saw mechanism for neutrino masses .",
    "it is hard to imagine doing all this with a smaller set of fields or fewer couplings .",
    "at least one * 45 * of higgs fields is needed to break so(10 ) and do 2/3 splitting . because of the antisymmetry of * 45 * one needs * two * * 10 * s to write the term @xmath104 .",
    "( as emphasized in ref . 1 such a doubling is probably necessary in any case to suppress proton decay . )",
    "getting the dw form of @xmath105 is done most simply with an auxiliary * 54*. breaking the rank of so(10 ) requires at least either @xmath106 or @xmath107 .",
    "and the tripling of adjoint representations serves two important purposes : allowing the @xmath108 term that couples different sectors together without destabilizing vevs and allowing a peccei - quinn - type symmetry to keep the doublets @xmath43 and @xmath44 light .",
    "certainly this model is not unique . for example",
    ", there are other ways to achieve the dw form of vevs or to break so(10 ) .",
    "but other choices do not seem to lead to models that are simpler with respect to the number of fields or the number of terms in @xmath38 .",
    "from an experimental point of view a very important question is whether higgsino - mediated proton decay can be `` strongly suppressed '' ( in the terminology of ref .",
    "1 ) in a fully natural way .",
    "the answer is yes , but it appears that a model of considerably greater complexity is required . we have already had to use three adjoints to get vevs in the dw form .",
    "( note that because we were forced to have terms @xmath85 and @xmath109 to prevent @xmath87 , the vevs of @xmath48 and @xmath110 are both compelled to have the dw form . ) to get a vev in the upside - down dw form , @xmath111 , required for `` strong suppression '' of proton decay would involve at least two * more * adjoints for a total of five .    on the grounds of economy it is justified to say that in so(10 ) proton decay is more likely to be suppressed `` weakly '' ( ie . numerically by factors of order one ) than `` strongly '' .",
    "this holds out some hope that proton decay mediated by higgsinos can be seen experimentally .",
    "as noted in the introduction , it is not known whether planck - scale physics necessarily induces all possible higher dimension operators allowed by local symmetry into the effective theory below the planck scale,@xmath10 and if they do how large the coefficients of such operators would be .",
    "if such effects are negligible then the relatively simple susy - gut presented in the previous section is adequate ( except for realistic quark and lepton masses , which will be dealt with in section 5 ) .    in this section",
    "we will assume the `` worst '' , namely that every higher- dimension operator allowed by local symmetry is present suppressed only by dimensionally appropriate powers of the planck mass .",
    "we will show by explicit example that the dimopoulos - wilczek mechanism can give a natural gauge hierarchy even under this assumption .",
    "this will involve identifying the dangerous higher - dimensional operators , exhibiting a local symmetry that rules them out , and showing that this symmetry can satisfy anomaly constraints .",
    "the symmetry used in the model constructed in this section is a single local u(1 ) for simplicity of analysis . a combination of symmetries , either continuous or discrete",
    ", could also play the same role .",
    "there are two kinds of higher - dimensional operators that endanger the gauge hierarchy , those that contain @xmath87 or @xmath112 and directly give a mass term to the light doublets , and those that destabilize the dw form of the vev of @xmath48 . in a model with only two * 10",
    "* s of higgs fields , such as that in section 2 , it is very difficult to prevent the first kind of operator by symmetry .",
    "the reason can be seen by considering fig .",
    "this diagram uses vertices @xmath88 and @xmath113 that must exist in a satisfactory model with only two * 10 * s ; the first for the dw mechanism , and the second to avoid an extra pair of light doublets .",
    "the resulting operator is not itself dangerous , as it involves the contraction @xmath114 and thus , because of the dw form of @xmath65 , does not give mass to the doublets in @xmath42 .",
    "however , if this term were allowed by local symmetry , then so also would be @xmath115tr@xmath116 which , by assumption , would be induced by planck - scale physics and would give a superlarge mass of order @xmath117 to the doublets in @xmath42 .",
    "this problem could be alleviated somewhat if the mass of @xmath50 came from a cubic term , @xmath118 where @xmath119 is a singlet superfield , instead of an explicit mass term , @xmath113 .",
    "then if the superpotential contained @xmath120 or @xmath121 a local symmetry would allow @xmath115tr@xmath122 or @xmath115tr@xmath123 giving @xmath12 to be of order @xmath124 or @xmath125 , respectively ; in either case too large .",
    "one could imagine an r - symmetry that would prevent such terms .",
    "for example , consider @xmath126 , where under @xmath127 all superfields transform as @xmath128 and @xmath129 , and under @xmath27 all superfields transform as @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "then @xmath118 and @xmath88 would be allowed but no higher - dimension term would be allowed until d = 9 . however , we have found no satisfactory model where the @xmath132 terms are forbidden using r - symmetries .",
    "another approach which we have found to lead to a fully realistic scenario involves the existence of three * 10 * s , which will be denoted @xmath42 , @xmath50 , and @xmath133 .",
    "suppose there are terms @xmath88 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 , where @xmath136 and @xmath137 denote singlet superfields with vevs @xmath138 ( later , for the sake of economy , we will identify @xmath137 with @xmath139 in our illustrative model ) , and @xmath65 has the dw form .",
    "then the @xmath140 mass matrix for the color - triplets in @xmath141 has rank 3 , while the mass matrix for the doublets has rank 2 , with the massless doublet being in @xmath42 .",
    "the point of this straightforward generalization of the model of section 2 is that the analogue of the diagram of fig .",
    "3 , which is shown in fig . 4 ,",
    "gives an operator of at least dimension 7 : @xmath142 .",
    "( it is assumed there is a field @xmath143 that has coupling @xmath144 . if there is no such field then fig .",
    "4 will give an operator of dimension even greater than 7 . ) again , it is not this operator itself which of interest , for given the dw form of @xmath65 and the way it is contracted , this operator contributes nothing to @xmath12 .",
    "but if such a term is allowed then so is @xmath87tr@xmath145 , which gives @xmath146 . given that this is a very crude dimensional estimate , this is satisfactorily close to the weak scale .",
    "contributions to @xmath147 , being off - diagonal in the mass matrix ( see eq .",
    "( 3 ) ) , need only be suppressed to @xmath148 to prevent @xmath12 from being larger than @xmath149 .",
    "thus dimension - four operators like @xmath150tr@xmath151 must be forbidden by local symmetry .",
    "given that the term @xmath88 must exist ( for the dw mechanism ) , it must be that @xmath152 transforms non - trivially under the local symmetry .",
    "finally , there are the operators that destabilize the dw form of @xmath65 .",
    "if @xmath153 , then , since @xmath48 appears off - diagonally in the mass matrix of the @xmath141 , @xmath154 is induced with @xmath155 . thus @xmath156 must be @xmath157 , and the destabilizing term for @xmath65 must be at least fifth order in superfields",
    ".    a dangerous term would be @xmath158 .",
    "from the fact that under @xmath159 , and @xmath160 , it follows that this term acts as a linear term for the @xmath161 component of @xmath48 .",
    "( the dw form is in ( 1,1,15 ) . )",
    "armed with this information , one can write down an @xmath162 model with the fields given in table ii , that avoids all higher - dimension operators dangerous to the gauge hierarchy",
    ". the form of the superpotential ( including certain relevant higher - dimension operators ) is    @xmath163    where each term has a dimensionless coefficient which has not been written .    the structure of eq .",
    "( 5 ) is easily understood by comparison with eq .",
    "( 1 ) . since @xmath152 has to transform non - trivially ( as noted above , to forbid @xmath150tr@xmath164 ) the terms @xmath108 and @xmath165 have now to come from higher - dimension operators ( which , by assumption , are present ) .",
    "similarly , because the singlet , @xmath136 , has a non - trivial u(1 ) charge , higher - dimension operators must be taken into account if it is to get a vev . since @xmath166",
    ", it must be that @xmath167 is @xmath168 .",
    "this in turn implies that @xmath169 .",
    "[ it should be noted that the soft susy - breaking terms , @xmath170 , @xmath171 , etc .",
    ", will insure that @xmath172 and @xmath173 . ]",
    "there are three anomaly conditions to be satisfied : @xmath174 , gravity@xmath175 , and @xmath176 .",
    "since there are only two unknowns , p and q ( see table ii ) , these equations are over - determined .",
    "but it is clear that additional gauge singlets will contribute to the gravity@xmath175 and @xmath176 anomalies without in any way affecting the issues discussed up to this point .",
    "for example , fields @xmath177 with charges @xmath178 and @xmath179 can get mass from @xmath180 and contribute @xmath181 to the gravity@xmath175 anomaly and @xmath182 to the @xmath176 anomaly while leaving the @xmath183 condition unaffected .",
    "the addition of such fields allows all the anomaly conditions to be satisfied .",
    "there could , of course , be also additional so(10)-non - singlet fields .",
    "it is apparent that the model exhibited in the last section , like that of section 2 , has an `` accidental '' peccei - quinn symmetry under which @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "in fact , every vector ( p , q ) , where p and q are defined by table ii , corresponds to the generator of a u(1 ) , which we can denote by @xmath186 , so that there are two linearly independent u(1 ) symmetries . one linear combination is anomaly free , by construction , and is local .",
    "the other u(1 ) has an @xmath183 ( and thus an @xmath187 ) anomaly and qualifies as a peccei- quinn symmetry .",
    "the @xmath183 anomaly - cancellation condition can be written as @xmath188 , where m and n are integers that depend on the particle content of the model .",
    "then the local u(1 ) is just @xmath189 .",
    "each operator will have a charge under @xmath186 of @xmath190 where m and n depend on the charges of the fields of which it is composed . if @xmath191 then the operator trivially is invariant under the full @xmath192 . if @xmath193 then the operator will be invariant under the local u(1 ) but not under the global u(1 ) , that is , the peccei- quinn symmetry . under the assumption of the previous section such an operator will be induced by quantum gravity in the effective superpotential below the planck scale , and , if it has dimension d and is composed entirely of fields that have vevs of order @xmath33 , then it will contribute @xmath194 to the axion mass . to solve the strong cp problem by the peccei - quinn mechanism",
    "this must be less than the qcd - instanton - generated axion mass , which in this case is given by @xmath195 , and thus d must be greater than 14 . in the model constructed in the previous section ,",
    "the lowest - dimension operator that contributes to the axion mass will be of dimension @xmath196 where m and n are defined as above and are normalized to be relatively prime integers .    to take a concrete example ,",
    "suppose that the quarks and leptons , @xmath197 , of the model of section 3 have charge @xmath198 so that they get mass directly from the term @xmath199 , and that there are no other so(10)-non- singlet fields in the theory except those listed in table ii .",
    "then the @xmath183 anomaly - cancellation condition turns out to be @xmath200 .",
    "consequently , the lowest dimension operators respecting @xmath201 that break @xmath202 are of dimension 33 .",
    "for example , one such is @xmath203 .",
    "( see table ii . )",
    "it is apparent that the charge assignments and thus the dimension of the smallest pq - violating operators are dependent upon details of the model . to take another example ,",
    "if the quark and lepton masses came instead from a higher - dimension operator like @xmath204 then the charge of @xmath197 would be @xmath205 , the anomaly condition would be @xmath206 , and the lowest - dimension pq - violating operator would have d=18 .",
    "charges such as these seem rather bizarre . but",
    "this model , wherein the local symmetry that controls the planck - scale physics is just a single u(1 ) , is presented merely as an illustration .",
    "the true theory could have , instead of a single u(1 ) , a product of several discrete or continuous symmetries . then even with the fields having smaller charges the smallest operator that respects all the local symmetries but violates @xmath202 could be of high dimension as required .",
    "the important lesson that the illustrative examples teach is that the same local symmetry that protects the gauge hierarchy from the ( possible ) effects of quantum gravity will also tend to preserve the axion solution to the strong cp problem .",
    "it should be emphasized that the axion decay constant , @xmath207 , is of order @xmath208 , and thus there is a potential `` axion energy problem '' for cosmology.@xmath209 however , in inflationary scenarios this problem is not necessarily real.@xmath210 but laboratory searches for axionic dark matter would have a difficulty due to the small cross - sections .",
    "the simple yukawa term that appears in eq.(1 ) , @xmath211 , gives the relations at the gut scale @xmath212 , and is therefore not satisfactory . in order that these characteristic su(5 ) and so(10 )",
    "predictions be modified it is necessary that the light fermion mass matrices feel the effects of the breaking of the grand - unified symmetries .",
    "the simplest possibility is that higher - dimensional operators contribute to them ; for instance , @xmath213 , where @xmath214 is some so(10)-non - singlet field that has a vev of order @xmath33 . if @xmath215 this term yields contributions to the quark and lepton mass matrices which are too small to cure the problem .",
    "( we are assuming that @xmath216 , which would be typical of a simple so(10 ) model , in which case the corrections to the lepton and down - quark matrices from gravity would be at most of order @xmath217 and @xmath218 . )",
    "thus it would appear that m must be of order @xmath33 , which implies that these operators are induced not by planck - scale physics but by integrating out fields with mass @xmath219 appearing in the effective sub - planck- scale theory .",
    "in other words , new fields must be introduced into the theory .",
    "a most economical possibility is to introduce a vectorlike pair consisting of a family and an anti - family , @xmath220",
    ". then diagrams like that shown in fig .",
    "5 become possible .",
    "( in that figure , @xmath221 could be replaced by the vev of a higgs field in the product @xmath222 , and/or @xmath214 could be replaced by a singlet , depending on the model . )",
    "what makes this such an economical and compelling idea is that it not only allows su(5 ) and so(10)-breaking effects to be introduced into the light quark and lepton mass matrices , but it also suggests a qualitative explanation for various observed features of those masses .",
    "in fact the kind of diagram shown in fig . 5 is the basis of a model of light - fermion masses that has already appeared in the literature.@xmath19    to understand this idea in more detail , consider adding to the model of section 3 the fields @xmath223 . and",
    "imagine that there is an adjoint higgs field , @xmath214 , whose vev points in a direction q which is a non - trivial linear combination of b - l and y ( weak hypercharge ) .",
    "( q is , of course , a generator of so(10 ) . )",
    "let @xmath224 , @xmath225 , @xmath197 , and @xmath214 be assigned @xmath201 charges such that the diagram in fig .",
    "5 exists , but that the cubic term @xmath226 is forbidden .",
    "then the effective mass term that arises from fig .",
    "5 is    @xmath227    the yukawa couplings , @xmath228 and @xmath229 , as shown in fig .",
    "5 , are those that couple @xmath197 to @xmath225 and @xmath224 : @xmath230 . and the hatted quantities in eq .",
    "( 6 ) are simply defined by @xmath231 and @xmath232 .",
    "the magnitudes of the couplings and the superheavy vevs that appear in fig .",
    "5 are all combined in the factor @xmath233 .",
    "@xmath234 and @xmath235 are the anti - fermion and fermion that are contained in @xmath197 . for the down quark matrix , for instance , @xmath236 and @xmath237 .",
    "note that the yukawa couplings , @xmath228 and @xmath229 , are vectors in `` family space '' rather than @xmath238 matrices as is the @xmath239 of eq .",
    "thus a `` factorized '' form of the mass matrices results.@xmath240 if there were only one such factorized term the mass matrices would be rank-1 , but as there are two terms in eq .",
    "( 6 ) each mass matrix is rank-2 , thus explaining the extreme lightness of the first generation ( which , of course , is assumed to get mass from some other , perhaps higher order , operator . )",
    "one may , without loss of generality , choose the basis in family space so that @xmath241 and @xmath242",
    ". then for the @xmath238 mass matrix of fermions of type @xmath243 ( @xmath244 , d , or u ) one has simply    @xmath245    where @xmath246 is defined to be @xmath247 for @xmath248 and @xmath249 for @xmath250 or @xmath251 . aside from the fact that they have rank 2 ( thus explaining the lightness of @xmath252 , @xmath253 , and @xmath254 ) these matrices have other significant features . if @xmath255 is somewhat small , then the second generation has mass of order @xmath256 times that of the third generation .",
    "thus @xmath257 would be sufficient to explain the hierarchy between the two heavier generations .",
    "but most interesting is that the form of these matrices explains why @xmath258 while @xmath259 , @xmath260 , and @xmath261 are all different . for , neglecting effects of order @xmath262 ,    @xmath263    while    @xmath264    the second equality in eq .",
    "( 8) follows from the fact that the same higgs field , @xmath44 , couples to @xmath265 and to @xmath266 , and thus @xmath267 for * any * generator @xmath137 ; whereas @xmath268 in general .",
    "we see that the simple diagram of fig .",
    "5 can explain why @xmath269 is the good relation , while the other su(5 ) and so(10 ) relations are not good , why the first generation is extremely light compared to the second and third , and can give `` fritzschian '' relations between the mass ratios and mixing angles .",
    "but obviously this is not the whole story , for some other diagram is needed to give non - zero masses to the first generation .",
    "also , the field denoted @xmath214 can not be one of the adjoints @xmath48 , @xmath110 , or @xmath152 of the model of section 3 , for @xmath137 can not be either purely @xmath270 or purely @xmath271 ( @xmath271 being the generator of the u(1 ) in @xmath272 ) .",
    "for @xmath273 would give a vanishing ( 3,3 ) element in eq .",
    "( 7 ) , and @xmath274 would give @xmath275 .",
    "nevertheless , the basic approach proposed in ref .",
    "10 and reviewed here clearly has many attractive features and seems quite compatible with the dimopoulos - wilczek framework that we have elaborated in the previous sections .",
    "it should be emphasized that a great advantage of so(10 ) for approaching the problem of understanding the quark and lepton masses and mixings is that so(10 ) relates all the types of fermions  up quarks , down quarks , and leptons  and can provide a natural explanation of the smallness of the km angles .",
    "the dimopoulos - wilczek mechanism has been shown to be a completely natural way to achieve doublet - triplet splitting and a gauge hierarchy . not only can a higgs sector be constructed for so(10 ) which implements this mechanism,@xmath276 but it can be done so in such a way that the superpotential is the most general consistent with some symmetry . moreover , even if planck - scale physics induces higher - dimension operators suppressed only by the dimensionally appropriate powers of the planck mass , it has been shown that local symmetry can protect the dw mechanism from disruption by these operators .",
    "it would appear that an invisible axion is an automatic consequence of the dw mechanism if it is implemented in a fully natural way , and that whatever local symmetries may be necessary to protect the gauge hierarchy from planck - scale effects also tend to protect the axion .",
    "finally , it has been shown how realistic and predictive schemes for quark and lepton masses can be obtained within the framework of the dw mechanism .",
    "there are , of course , other attractive schemes of unification .",
    "each has strong and weak points .",
    "susy - su(5 ) can be made natural if 2/3 splitting is done using the `` missing - partner mechanism '' . the cost is the introduction of the somewhat high - rank higgs representations , @xmath277 .",
    "the main virtue of su(5 ) is that it is the smallest grand - unified group .",
    "flipped su(5 ) ( really @xmath278 ) has the great virtues that the missing - partner mechanism can be implemented in a beautiful and economical way , and that only small representations are required .",
    "the main drawbacks are that the group is not simple , so that the great accuracy of the @xmath279 prediction has a less straightforward explanation , as has the relation @xmath280 .",
    "another intriguing possibility is the group @xmath281,@xmath282 which is suggested by some superstring scenarios .",
    "the good points of so(10 ) unification are many and well - known .",
    "some of them have been mentioned in the introduction and in section 5 of this paper .",
    "it would seem that a fully natural 2/3 splitting and gauge hierarchy in so(10 ) requires the dimopoulos - wilczek mechanism .",
    "we have shown that this natural and realistic .    finally , we have argued that `` weak suppression '' of higgsino - mediated proton decay can be achieved in much simpler models than `` strong suppression '' ( in the terminology of ref .",
    "1 ) , giving some reason to expect , in the context of so(10 ) , that proton decay can be seen experimentally .",
