    "as the nonlinear spin waves are stable uniform solutions under the condition ( [ stab ] ) we use them as a reference state to construct localized solutions .",
    "we are looking for solitary solutions which have the form of a spin wave for @xmath31 determined by parameters @xmath24 ,  @xmath25 .",

    "moreover , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ mgv ] ) the maximum ( minimum ) soliton velocity is given by the minimum ( maximum ) group velocity of the linear magnons on the upper ( lower ) magnon branch .",

    "+ the energy density of the solitary waves is given by @xmath101 where we have subtracted the homogenous energy density of the underlying spin wave . from the explicit solutions ( [ sol1 ] ) ,  ( [ sol2 ] ) we calculate the total energy and the quantities @xmath20 ,  @xmath21 : @xmath102 in eqs .  ( [ mom1 ] ) ,  ( [ ang1 ] )",

    "for @xmath14 and @xmath27 we have shown that the spin wave solutions are unstable . moreover , as the integration of eq .",
    "( [ eom5 ] ) is formally the same as for @xmath10 , we see from ( [ sol1 ] ) that we need @xmath106 for a localized solution .",
    "because of ( [ ex ] ) this can not be achieved for nonnegative @xmath3 .",
    "thus no localized solution of the form ( [ ansatz ] ) exists for @xmath27 + the case @xmath44 is particular .",
    "the corresponding spin wave realizes the absolute minimum of @xmath22 and the wavenumber @xmath25 becomes irrelevant . for such boundary condition",
    "well  known solitons exist , which can be derived similarly by elementary integration ( kosevich _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , long and bishop @xcite ) .",
    "these solitons are characterized by two independent parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 because the relation ( [ par ] ) is not valid if the boundary condition ( [ eom6 ] ) is not imposed .",
    "therefore the soliton can alternatively be described by two independent conserved quantities , the total momentum and the total angular momentum , and the exact dipersion law @xmath107 can be obtained @xcite .",
    "these two  parametric solutions are also valid for @xmath108 and suffciently large @xmath109 , and under further conditions algebraic solitons arise as limiting cases @xcite .",
    "we now want to establish the stabitlity of the solitary waves under interaction with magnons and under scattering with each other .",
    "the stability is clear if one can prove the integrability of the model for the generalized boundary conditions used here .",
    "the solitary waves have some remarkable similarity to dark solitons occuring as solutions to the nonlinear schrdinger equation with repulsive interaction @xcite .",
    "the latter evolution equation is well  known to be integrable @xcite .",
    "moreover , nakamura and sasada @xcite have proposed a gauge transformation mapping the nonlinear schrdinger equation with attractive ( repulsive ) interaction on the heisenberg chain with easy  axis ( easy  plane ) anisotropy , where the boundary conditions to the spin models correspond to the absolute ground state .",
    "unfortunately , for the easy  plane case which is of interest here , this work suffers from some errors pointed out by other authors @xcite .",
    "thus , we shall use other means to examine the question of stability .",
    "+ in order to provide a brief demonstration of the physical significance of the solitary waves presented before and also to study discreteness effects to these continuum solutions we have carried out numerical simulation for the discrete model ( [ defmoda ] ) .",
    "the spin dynamics is given by the following landau ",
    "equation : @xmath110 with @xmath111 and @xmath112 being the unit vector in @xmath18direction .",
    "this equation may also be written in an explicitly hamiltonian form , e.  g. using the canonical conjugate variables @xmath113 ,  @xmath114 .",
    "it is seen easily that the discretized version of the nonlinear spin wave , i.  e. @xmath115 ,  @xmath116 , is an exact solution of the dicrete model @xcite .",
    "the natural time unit of the system is chosen to be unity by the definition ( [ defmoda ] ) .",
    "we numerically integrated the equations of motion ( [ ll ] ) on lattices of up to 5000 sites using a runge  kutta scheme of fourth order with a stepwidth of @xmath117 . the boundary conditions were implemented by rotating the spins on the terminal lattice sites with a constant frequency @xmath28 given by ( [ dis ] ) while the @xmath18component has the constant value @xmath24 .",
    "+ if one uses the one  soliton solution of the continuum model evaluated at the discrete lattice sites as initial data for a simulation , magnons are emitted from the soliton during the first few hundred time units .",
    "this is an discreteness effect since the continuum solitary wave can only be an approximate solution to the discrete model . after this process",
    "the soliton moves with constant velocity over the lattice , with no measurable sign of instability over several thousand time units .",
    "the separation of magnons and solitons corresponds to the result in the continuum model that the admissible soliton velocities and magnon group velocities are strictly separated . in figure [ fig4 ]",
    "we show an example where this effect is comparatively strong for a certain choice of parameters .",
    "moreover , small magnons are also radiated from the edges of the system during the simulation .",
    "+ since the spin configuration outside a soliton decreases rapidly to the underlying nonlinear spin wave , different one  soliton solutions can be matched and scattering experiments can be carried out . if one uses appropriately matched continuum solitons as initial data , the two solitons can apparently pass each other keeping perfectly their shape and identity .",
    "more precisely , we found no effect of instability on the background of magnons that stem from the adjustment to the discrete system in the beginning of the simulation or are radiated from the edges .",
    "this holds for all values of the system parameters and energy of both @xmath88 and @xmath89solitons .",
    "a typical example is shown in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "+ for more precise measurements the magnon background has to be reduced .",
    "this can be done by using the soliton shape after the adjustment to the lattice , i.  e. the emission of magnons , as initial data for further simulations .",
    "different spin configurations obtained by this procedure can be matched for a scattering experiment .",
    "this method leads to much purer initial conditions and works particularly well in the case @xmath103 ,  @xmath100 , where the spin configuration outside the solitons is spatially constant . in order to prevent the small magnons from the edges disturbing the scattering process one can choose a sufficiently large system . in figure [ fig6 ]",
    "we show a typical scattering process . on the natural scale of the problem the two",
    "solitons apparently pass each other without any sign of instability .",
    "if the scale of the vertical axis is magnified by a factor of about @xmath118 one clearly sees that the solitons do not perfectly keep their shape but magnons with amplitudes of order @xmath119 are emitted as a result of the scattering process .",
    "we have repeated this experiment with different stepwidths of the runge  kutta scheme and confirmed that this effect is not a numerical artifact .",
    "+ this observation strongly indicates the nonintegrability of the discrete model in the strict mathematical sense . of course , this does not imply any statement about the integrability of the continuum model under the generalized boundary conditions .",
    "in particular not , since the discrete model shows properties very near to those of integrable models .",
    "+ in summary , we have demonstrated by numerical simulations that our solitary waves are physically significant objects showing a highly distinct but not absolute stability in their time evolution .",
    "in this work we have examined the classical heisenberg chain with uniaxial anisotropy under generalized boundary conditions . for an anisotropy of",
    "easy  plane type two branches of solitons are found on the background of a nonlinear spin wave that is used as boundary condition .",
    "the parameter area of stability of the nonlinear spin wave solution coincides with the existence of the solitary waves . for the easy  axis and the isotropic model we have shown that no further one  soliton solutions exist apart from those already known .",
    "moreover , in these cases the spin wave solutions are found to be unstable .",
    "this fact has apparently not been realized yet , since the spin wave solutions ( [ sw ] ) have been discussed for such systems by various authors without mentioning their instability @xcite . + for the case @xmath10 we have examined the stability of the continuum solitary waves by numerical simulations of the discrete heisenberg chain .",
    "the solitary waves turn out to be highly but not absolutely stable in their time evolution and especially under scattering with each other .",
    "thus the discrete model is shown to have properties very near to those typical for integrable models , but small effects indicating nonintegrability are clearly observed . from these numerical results and also from the similarity of the solitary waves obtained here to dark solitons of the nonlinear schrdinger equation one",
    "can strongly conjecture the integrability of the continuum model .",
    "+ the spin wave state ( [ sw ] ) could serve as a phenomenological model for a one  dimensional easy  plane magnet at finite ( not necessarily very low ) temperature . in thermal equilibrium",
    "the spatially averaged energy density and magnetization have certain values determining the parameters @xmath24 ,  @xmath25 .",
    "however , the long  range ordering in this one  dimensional system must be destroyed at finite temperature by thermal fluctuations @xcite .",
