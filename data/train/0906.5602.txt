    "disordered magnetic systems have been systematically studied in condensed matter and statistical physics . from a theoretical point of view , the most studied case has certainly been the random field ising model ( rfim )  @xcite , because of its simplicity as a frustrated system and relevancy to experiments  @xcite which has been quite boosted after the identification of the rfim with diluted antiferromagnets in the presence of a uniform magnetic field belangerreview , fishmanaharony , pozenwong , cardy and several ferromagnetic compounds as well  @xcite .    in order to generate the local random field , both the gaussian and the bimodal probability density function ( pdf )",
    "have intensively been used machta00 , middleton , hartmann .",
    "nevertheless , controversy over the order of the low - temperature phase transition has still been at the helm of several discussions .",
    "on one hand , a high temperature series expansion up to @xmath8th order showed a continuous phase transition for both the gaussian and the bimodal pdf  @xcite . on the other hand , from an exact determination of the ground states in higher dimensions ( @xmath9 ) , swift _",
    "et al _  swift found a discontinuous phase transition for the bimodal random field , whereas for @xmath10 dimensions and the gaussian distribution the transition is continuous . by applying the wang - landau algorithm @xcite , recent simulations on 3d lattices claimed the discovery of first - order - like features in the strongly disordered regime for both those pdfs  hernandez , machta06 .",
    "as an alternative to the above mentioned approaches , there is the mean field theory which can present a good qualitative agreement with some short - range interaction models and experiments .",
    "once more , the gaussian and the bimodal pdf have been widely investigated @xcite as well as related distributions such as the trimodal  @xcite and the double - gaussian  @xcite or the treble - gaussian  @xcite . in the gaussian rfim case ,",
    "the phase diagram only presents continuous phase transitions  @xcite , whereas in the bimodal case the phase diagram presents a continuous phase transition for high temperatures and low random - field intensities and for low temperatures and high random - field intensities a first - order transition arises therefrom  @xcite . in other more elaborated cases",
    "a rich critical behavior can be found for finite temperatures as it has been recently conveyed in @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we can understand that the choice of the local random field pdf is of crucial importance for a good theoretical description of real systems . in this particular context and based on the identification of the rfim with diluted antiferromagnets in a uniform field , for which the local random fields are expressed in terms of quantities that vary in both signal and magnitude @xcite , the use of continuous pdfs has demonstrated to be a very promising approach  @xcite .    the utilization of dirac delta and gaussian related distributions is much supported on the easiness of the analytical treatment of the subsequent equations as well as the pervasiveness of the gaussian distribution .",
    "although the gaussian was assumed for many generations as the `` natural distribution '' , in the last decades the concept of ( asymptotic ) scale - invariance of probability density functions have abundantly emerged  @xcite . in the realm of disordered systems ,",
    "pdfs different to the @xmath11-gaussian or the @xmath11-dirac delta were used to explain the critical behavior of several compounds .",
    "for instance , pdfs with very fat tails were introduced to analyze organic charge - transfer compounds like : n - methyl - phenazium tetra - cyanoquinodimethanide ( nmp - tcnq ) , quinolinium-(tcnq)@xmath12 , acridinium-(tcnq)@xmath12 and phenazine - tcnq , as first reported in refs .",
    "fat - materials .",
    "conversely , a sub - gaussian distribution was used to account for the magnetic properties and the critical behavior of poly(metal phosphinates )  @xcite .",
    "last but not least , as was proven by gosset  @xcite , asymptotic scale invariant distributions can be derived from the gaussian distribution when finite elements are taken into account so that finite and scale - dependent systems can be treated as infinite and ( asymptotically ) scale - independent .",
    "therefore , the study of more general continuous pdfs turns up very interesting as it furnishes a more widespread picture of disordered magnetic systems than the distributions used up to now . with such a goal in mind",
    ", we study herein the aftermath of applying a more general family of continuous pdfs in the mean field rfim .",
    "explicitly , our pdf reproduces the @xmath3- and @xmath2-distributions for real degrees of freedom . for specific values of the triplet composed of the degree of freedom , the temperature and the pdf width",
    ", our results show that the system experiences a continuous phase transition that does not dependent on the finiteness of the standard deviation and the scale behavior ( dependence or independence ) of the random field .",
    "moreover , for pdfs fatter than the cauchy - lorentz , we determine the emergence of an inflexion point in the temperature versus pdf width phase diagrams that coexists with a divergence at zero temperature of the free energy per spin .",
    "the infinite - range - interaction ising model in the presence of an external random magnetic field is defined in terms of the hamiltonian ,    @xmath13    where the sum @xmath14 runs over all distinct pairs of spins @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) .",

    "the parameter @xmath58 is equal to width @xmath32 .",
    "accordingly , if we bear in mind the previous work by aharony @xcite ,  we can hold that our enquiry also sheds light on the low temperature behavior of the random - field ising model with the local magnetic field associated with a @xmath4-stable lvy distribution . in fig .",
