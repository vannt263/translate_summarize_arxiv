    "coherent conversion of an atomic to a molecular bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) is a first step towards ` superchemistry ' @xcite , which is the stimulated emission of molecules in a chemical reaction .",
    "a number of studies of this @xcite have shown that direct conversion via raman photoassociation @xcite appears feasible , based on stimulated free - bound and bound - bound transitions in the presence of two laser fields of different frequencies @xcite . here",
    "pairs of atoms from the two - atom continuum of the ground electronic potential are transferred  via an excited bound molecular state  to a bound molecular state of a lower energy in the ground potential .",
    "raman photoassociation allows coupling to a single molecular state , which can be selected by the raman laser frequencies .",
    "practical estimates using available lasers and transitions indicate that coherent transfer may be limited by spontaneous emission from the intermediate molecular excited electronic state .",
    "another mechanism that can result in coupled atomic - molecular bec systems @xcite is based on feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "however , realistic analysis and experimental implementations @xcite indicate that the loss processes due to inelastic atom - molecule collisions occur at a significant rate .    a possible route towards minimizing losses and decoherence from spontaneous emission in photoassociation is stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) @xcite , in which a counter - intuitive pulse sequence is used , where the first input pulse couples the molecular levels - even when there are no molecules present .",
    "in this situation , a dark superposition state is formed , due to interference effects between the atomic and molecular electronic ground states .",
    "this minimizes the probability of a real transition to the molecular excited state , and hence reduces spontaneous emission .",
    "previous analyses of this problem have not taken into account losses , collisions , or the full three - dimensional structure of the two bose condensates in a trap .    in this paper",
    ", we provide an analysis which is relevant in a physically appropriate model that does include the known physics of spontaneous emission losses , @xmath0-wave scattering processes and spatial diffusion of the condensates .",
    "the result is that the stirap process appears feasible at high laser pulse intensities , provided the rabi frequency is much greater than the two - photon detuning due to mean - field interactions . we give a detailed numerical calculation based on both homogeneous and inhomogeneous three - dimensional mean - field ( gross - pitaevskii type ) theories , including couplings to non - resonant intermediate levels , and show how the results scale with the two - photon detuning , pulse duration and raman pulse intensities .",
    "an optimal situation is found by considering an off - resonance operation and different effective rabi frequencies in the two raman channels .",
    "we show that these strategies can greatly enhance the conversion efficiency for given laser intensities , thus making the experimental requirements much more feasible .",
    "we start by considering the theory of coherently interacting atomic and molecular condensates needed to describe this process @xcite , and assume a specific coupling mechanism based on stimulated free - bound raman transitions @xcite , in which two atoms of energy @xmath1 collide to from a molecule of energy @xmath2 , with an excited molecular state forming as an intermediate step .",
    "the raman coupling is induced by two laser fields of frequencies @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and becomes resonant when the raman detuning @xmath5 goes to zero .",
    "this allows coupling to a single molecular state , which can be selected by the raman laser frequencies .",
    "we derive the atom - molecule coupling for a simplified model of the two - body interaction @xcite , in which the atoms interact in their electronic ground state through a single born - oppenheimer potential @xmath6 .",
    "molecules are formed in a single bound vibrational state of energy @xmath2 with radial wave function @xmath7 .",
    "two free atoms with zero relative kinetic energy have a total energy @xmath8 , and a relative radial wave function @xmath9 , normalized so that asymptotically @xmath10 .",
    "we assume that the laser field has two frequency components , with @xmath11   $ ] , @xmath12 . each couples the ground electronic state to a single electronically excited state described by a potential @xmath13 , with ` bare ' electronic rabi frequencies @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the molecular electric dipole matrix element with a nuclear separation of @xmath16 .",
    "the excited state has vibrational levels @xmath17 with energies @xmath18 and radial wave functions @xmath19 .",
    "all bound levels are normalized so that @xmath20 .",
    "we consider the case of near resonant transitions @xmath21 and denote the resonant excited vibrational level @xmath22 via index @xmath23 ( see fig .",
    "[ diagram ] ) .",
    "the usual quantum field theory hamiltonian @xcite for noninteracting atomic ( @xmath24 ) and molecular ( @xmath25 ) species , in well - defined internal states described by annihilation operators @xmath26 , is given by : @xmath27 .\\ ] ] here @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) are the masses , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the trapping potential including the internal energy for the @xmath32-th species , where we define @xmath33 .",
    "including @xmath0-wave scattering processes and laser induced particle inter - conversion , together with the assumption of a momentum cut - off , results in the following terms in the effective interaction hamiltonian : @xmath34 , \\\\ \\hat{h}_{int}^{(2 - 3 ) } & = & \\int d^{3}{\\mathbf{x}}\\left [ \\frac{-\\hbar { \\omega } _ { 2}}{2}e^{-i\\omega _ { 2}t}\\hat{\\psi } _ { 2}^{{}}({\\mathbf{x}})\\hat{\\psi } _ { 3}^{\\dagger } ( { \\mathbf{x}})+h.c.\\right ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath35 ( @xmath12 )  are the molecular rabi frequencies .",
    "these can be treated using the franck - condon overlap integrals @xmath36 , if we take @xmath37 as the mean electronic rabi frequency .",
    "we note that @xmath38 , which connects the atomic and molecular condensates , has units of @xmath39 , and must be multiplied by the atomic condensate amplitude to obtain a true rabi frequency .",
    "the couplings @xmath40 in the diagonal case are given by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the @xmath32-th species @xmath0-wave scattering length , while the non - diagonal terms are given by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the inter - species scattering length and @xmath45 is the reduced mass .",
    "in addition , we account for losses from each state , at a rate @xmath46 .",
    "the resulting heisenberg equations for the field operators are treated within the mean - field approximation , in which the operators are replaced by their mean values , and a factorization is assumed .",
    "this approximation is expected to be valid at sufficiently high density .",
    "corrections due to quantum correlations @xcite have been treated in greater detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "next , we introduce rotating frame detunings , defined so that : @xmath47 in the case of uniform condenstates , @xmath31 are equal to @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "this results in the following set of gross - pitaevskii type of equations for the mean - field amplitudes , in rotating frames such that @xmath50 $ ] : @xmath51 here @xmath52 is the @xmath32 -th gross - pitaevskii mean - field detuning in the rotating frame , defined so that : @xmath53 we also introduce the two - photon laser detuning at trap center : @xmath54    in addition to losses due to spontaneous emission from the electronic excited states , rotationally or vibrationally inelastic atom - molecule collisions may also give rise to losses .",
    "the magnitude of these rates is presently unknown , and we neglect them here .",
    "we note that these rates should decrease rapidly with increasing molecular binding energy and go to zero in the molecular ground state , so that it should be possible to obtain a very low rate by selecting the coupling to a deeply bound molecular level .",
    "this approximation means that we will set @xmath55 in the following treatment , where @xmath56 is the kronecker delta - function .",
    "the simplest stirap scheme employs exact tuning of the laser frequencies to the bare state resonances , i.e. , @xmath57 .",
    "this , however , is not necessarily required as the stirap can still occur with detuned intermediate levels . moreover , as we show below , in bec environments , the off - resonance operation turns out to be more efficient if the detunings compensate for the phase shifts due to mean - field energies . in effect",
    "this is equivalent to a renormalized two - photon `` on - resonant '' operation in which @xmath58 .    if , instead of considering near - resonance coupling , we consider a large intermediate level detuning so that the excited state can be adiabatically eliminated , we recover the basic terms in the set of equations analyzed in @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , this would give us the previously known result @xcite for the laser induced modification to the scattering length @xmath59 occurring in a simple single - laser photoassociation of pairs of atoms , thus justifying the above form of the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "in the present paper , however , we assume that the detunings @xmath60 are small compared to the characteristic separation between the vibrational levels so that all other vibrational levels can be neglected .",
    "the near - resonant excited level is treated explicitly , rather than eliminated adiabatically as in @xcite .",
    "before carrying out simulations of the full @xmath61 equations in a trap , it is instructive to start with a simplified version of the theory - in which there are no kinetic energy terms .",
    "we expect this approximation to be valid in the thomas - fermi limit of large , relatively dense condensates , which is a regime of much current experimental interest .",
    "this is described by the following set of equations : @xmath62 where we have introduced as an effective thomas - fermi limit frequency shift , @xmath63 this corresponds to the treatment given in @xcite , except that we explicitly include the loss term @xmath64 due to spontaneous emission , the @xmath0-wave scattering processes due to @xmath40 , and the franck - condon integrals into the coupling coefficients for the free - bound and bound - bound transitions .",
    "in order to understand how this is related to the usual stirap technique in a three - level @xmath65 atomic system , we introduce a new wave - function @xmath66 , which corresponds to the coherent amplitude of a ( virtual ) molecular condensate with the same number of atoms as in the atomic bec . we then introduce a bose - stimulated rabi frequency , which includes a local coherent bec amplitude for the first free - bound transition : @xmath67 .",
    "this leads to the equations : @xmath68 these are precisely the usual stirap equations , except with additional detunings coming from the mean - field interactions , and a rabi frequency in the first transition which is proportional to the amplitude of the atomic bec wave - function . in practise",
    ", the rabi frequency may have an additional space - dependence due to the spatial variation of the laser phase and intensity .",
    "we therefore conclude that , provided we can satisfy the normal adiabatic stirap requirements of slow time - variation in the _ effective _ rabi frequencies in the above equations , the technique will also work for a bec .",
    "this is a simpler proof than previously @xcite . in particular",
    ", we can immediately deduce the expected solution for real rabi frequencies in the adiabatic limit . in order to have @xmath69 ,",
    "one requires : @xmath70    here the space dependent mixing angle @xmath71 is obtained from the ratio of effective rabi frequencies : @xmath72 ^{1/2}\\ , .\\ ] ]    we can see that _ initially _ , while @xmath73 is still close to its initial value , the mixing angle is close to its expected value in normal stirap , since @xmath74 .",
    "however , at the final stages of the adiabatic passage , the nonlinear effects due to the atom - molecular coupling become important .",
    "as the atomic bec amplitude only varies on the time - scale of the input fields , the nonlinear atom - molecular coupling term by itself should not introduce new adiabatic restrictions .",
    "however , there will be time - dependent detunings introduced by the mean - field terms .",
    "finally , we can see that similar conclusions can also be reached in a non - uniform bec , by replacing the uniform detunings with appropriate gross - pitaevskii detunings , that include the spatial potentials . in a typical bec cooled in the thomas - fermi regime ,",
    "we expect the kinetic energy terms to have relatively small effects .",
    "stirap can therefore be implemented as usually by using two laser pulses applied in counterintuitive order .",
    "we choose gaussian pulses of the form @xmath75,\\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; ( i=1,2),\\ ] ] or @xmath76,\\ ] ] where the peak values are related as follows : @xmath77 .",
    "the pulse at frequency @xmath4 is applied first , with the center at @xmath78 , while the second pulse at frequency @xmath3 is delayed by @xmath79 , i. e. , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the delay coefficient , and @xmath82 is the pulse duration , which we assume is the same for both pulses .    in terms of the rabi frequencies ,",
    "the adiabatic condition for stirap now reads as @xcite : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the rms rabi frequency , @xmath85 is the duration during which the pulses overlap , and @xmath86 simply corresponds to the detuning of the single - photon transition .",
    "however , there is a second condition , which is often not stated explicitly .",
    "this is that stirap requires an effective two - photon resonance , to avoid dephasing between the initial and final states in the dark - state superposition .",
    "the two - photon resonance condition is different from the usual stirap case , since a detuning of @xmath87 causes a phase rotation _ both _ in _ @xmath88 _ and in _ @xmath89 _ as well , since this also includes a phase term from the condensate . as a result ,",
    "the necessary condition for two - photon resonance is therefore : @xmath90    as is usually the case in stirap , these conditions can not be satisfied very early or late in the pulse sequence , when the rabi frequencies are small ; but they should be satisfied over most of the stirap interaction , and over most of the condensate volume . for simplicity , we will apply these conditions to the peak rabi frequency @xmath91 , and to the total pulse duration @xmath82 .",
    "further , since @xmath89 is itself a function of the stirap evolution , we introduce an effective first rabi frequency , defined in terms of the initial density @xmath92 .",
    "this is an upper bound to the stimulated rabi frequency ; thus @xmath93 ( and sometimes we write @xmath94 , for uniformity ) , where @xmath95,\\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; ( i=1,2)\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath96 and @xmath97 .    a typical pulse sequence is shown in fig .",
    "[ stirap - pulses ] . from the definition of @xmath98 ,",
    "the franck - condon overlap integrals are an important issue from the point of view of employing a realistic set of parameters .",
    "since the overlap integrals enter into the definition of the effective rabi frequencies , their values will affect the adiabatic condition rewritten in terms of the `` bare '' electronic rabi frequencies @xmath37 .",
    "we will analyze this in more detail in the next section .",
    "we start by considering a uniform condensate , described by a similar equation to the thomas - fermi case , except with a uniform trap potential for simplicity :    @xmath99    here the uniform detuning term @xmath100 is defined as the thomas - fermi detuning , evaluated at the trap center .",
    "we start by considering a uniform condensate in which the @xmath0-wave scattering interactions are negligible ( i.e. , @xmath101 ) , and assume exact resonances with respect to bare state transitions , @xmath102 .",
    "we first simulate the above simplified equations ( [ j-3 ] ) with an initial condition of a pure atomic condensate .",
    "this model is more realistic than that of m. mackie et al .",
    "@xcite , as it includes spontaneous emission .",
    "we find that including the loss term @xmath64 imposes restrictions on the effective rabi frequencies @xmath103 and the duration of the pulses @xmath82 .",

    "the final step in our analysis is to include the trap potential and the kinetic energy terms and simulate the full set of coupled inhomogeneous mean - field equations ( [ psi_3 ] ) in three space dimensions .",

    "we note that the characteristic time scale associated with the trap potential can be estimated as @xmath142 s. the time scale associated with the kinetic energy term is estimated from the ` healing ' length @xmath143 which corresponds to a healing time scale of @xmath144 . under adiabatic conversion of an equilibrium ( thomas - fermi like ) atomic bec , this healing time scale coincides with the dephasing time",
    "@xmath145 associated with the mean field energy potential and discussed before .",
    "both these time scales ( @xmath146 and @xmath144 ) are longer than the duration of pulses in stirap we employed earlier .",
    "therefore , addition of these terms can not dramatically change the results and conclusions obtained above for uniform condensates .    to show this we first consider the idealized three - level model with parameter values given in tables [ stirap_param ] and [ table_u ] , i.e. the case of equal and relatively strong effective rabi frequencies .",

    "to summarize , stirap is a potential route towards the coherent conversion of an atomic to a molecular bec .",
    "this process involves stimulated emission of molecules , and is very different to normal chemical kinetics .",
    "as such , it is a form of ` superchemistry ' @xcite .",
    "stirap in an atomic bec can be treated in a very similar way to normal stirap , by introducing an effective rabi frequency for the first photo - association transition .",
    "a potential difficulty is the relatively low values of the effective rabi frequency in the first or photo - association transition .",
    "this can be regarded as physically due to the low densities of atoms in a typical weakly interacting bec , compared with atoms in a molecule .",
    "this means that the corresponding franck - condon coefficient , after multiplying by the relevant bec amplitude , has a very small value .",
    "thus , the laser intensities required may be quite high , in order to obtain rabi frequencies comparable to those used in atomic transitions .",
    "this by itself is not critical , since deep in the adiabatic limit it is normally permissible to use low rabi frequencies , as long as the associated time - scales are long enough . from this point of view",
    ", the use of stirap , and consequent reduction of spontaneous emission , is a physically sensible idea .",
    "however , including @xmath0-wave scattering or mean - field processes into the model for stirap sets up a characteristic two - photon dephasing time scale , so that the pulse durations in stirap have to be _",
    "shorter _ than a certain critical value .",
    "short pulse durations necessarily involve high values for the effective rabi frequencies in the usual symmetric case of @xmath161 , thus requiring a very high laser power for the first transition - if the adiabaticity condition is to be maintained .    in order to ease this demanding requirement and be able to achieve highest possible conversion efficiency at smaller total laser power",
    ", we propose to use an off - resonance operation ( thus cancelling part of the mean - field detuning effect ) and effective rabi frequencies @xmath162 and @xmath128 of different magnitudes .",
    "this has the effect of dramatically increasing coherent molecule production , in a physically accessible regime of moderate laser intensity .",
    "further improvements may be possible by tailoring the input pulse frequencies to the time - dependent two - photon detuning , caused by inter - atomic and intermolecular scattering .",
    "we have carried out mean - field calculations in three dimenisons to verify that trap inhomogeneity should not have adverse effects on the stirap process .",
    "finally , we stress the importance of radiative losses and dephasing due to incoherent processes that occur during stirap .",
    "these processes are usually assumed to be negligible in ordinary stirap between purely atomic or molecular states . in the present case of coupled atomic / molecular becs ,",
    "this assumption can not be easily justified since the free - bound transition typically involves a relatively low effective rabi frequency , which necessitates long pulse durations .",
    "instead , we find that the incoherent couplings can be rather destructive unless special care is taken to minimize their effect .",
    "this involves detailed knowledge of the structure of the free - bound and bound - bound transitions and subsequent identification of optimum target levels in stirap , so that the overall conversion efficiency remains comparable to the predictions of the simplified three - level model .",

    "<S> the process of stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) provides a possible route for the generation of a coherent molecular bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) from an atomic bec . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze this process in a three - dimensional mean - field theory , including atom - atom interactions and non - resonant intermediate levels . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the process is feasible , but at larger rabi frequencies than anticipated from a crude single - mode lossless analysis , due to two - photon dephasing caused by the atomic interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we then identify optimal strategies in stirap allowing one to maintain high conversion efficiencies with smaller rabi frequencies and under experimentally less demanding conditions .    </S>",
