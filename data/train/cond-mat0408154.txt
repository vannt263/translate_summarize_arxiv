    "electrons with long range coulomb interactions display a rich and complex behavior . in doped semiconductors and disordered metals ,",
    "electrons are in the presence of quenched disorder , and the competition between coulomb interactions and disorder produces a coulomb glass which is an amorphous insulator .",
    "a great deal of effort has been expended in studying various thermodynamic properties of coulomb glasses such as the specific heat @xcite , the presence of a coulomb glass phase transition in which the electrons are frozen into a highly disordered arrangement @xcite , and the coulomb gap @xcite .",
    "coulomb interactions between localized electrons result in the so  called coulomb gap in the single particle density of states that is centered at the fermi energy .",
    "simulations have found a coulomb gap in the density of states @xcite , and experimental evidence for a coulomb gap has been seen in tunneling measurements @xcite .",
    "many of the theoretical studies of coulomb glasses have been as a function of temperature . in this paper",
    "we will study what happens as we vary the amount of disorder as well as the temperature .",
    "we will start with an ordered system and study the effect of gradually introducing disorder into a three dimensional system of electrons with long range coulomb interactions .",
    "the system is discrete in the sense that the electrons sit on half of the available sites . in the ordered case the sites form a cubic lattice .",
    "the disorder is introduced in the positions of the sites and their deviation from the positions in a cubic lattice .",
    "for all values of disorder , the system undergoes a second order phase transition as the temperature is lowered .",
    "we will study the effects on the thermodynamics of this phase transition as a function of disorder .",
    "discretizing our coulomb system means that it corresponds to an ising system with long range interactions .",
    "an site occupied with an electron corresponds to spin - up and an empty site corresponds to spin - down .",
    "this is a very general model , and as a result relevant work has been done in other fields motivated by somewhat different physical systems . in particular",
    "there is the ising model with long range interactions .",
    "also the ordered case is related to work that has been done on ionic fluids near criticality .",
    "it is worth briefly reviewing the work that has been done in those fields .    in the case of translational invariance ,",
    "ionic fluids near criticality have been a subject of both experimental and theoretical investigations @xcite . as in the case of electrons ,",
    "this system is somewhat simplified by discretizing the system and only allowing the charges to sit on specified sites . for ionic fluids",
    "this is known as the lattice restricted primitive model ( lrpm ) @xcite where there are equal numbers of positive and negative ions with the same diameter sitting on lattice sites . in the lrpm",
    "there is no quenched disorder .",
    "there are positive sites , negative sites , and neutral sites ( empty sites ) corresponding to an ising spin1 model with coulomb interactions .",
    "the phase diagram in the density  temperature plane has a second order transition line from a high temperature paramagnetic phase to a low temperature antiferromagnetic phase @xcite .",
    "this transition is in the ising universality class with critical exponent @xmath2 . at even lower temperatures",
    "there is a first order phase transition in which the system undergoes a phase separation into a high density ordered phase and a low density disordered phase .",
    "if there are no neutral sites ( ionic density @xmath3 ) , which corresponds to the antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 ising model , then there is just the second order transition from the high temperature disordered phase to the low temperature ordered antiferromagnetic phase in three dimensions . for the purposes of this paper we are interested in this case where there are no neutral sites .",
    "every positively charged site has a positive ion or missing electron , and every negatively charged site has a negative ion or an electron .",
    "the fact that the ionic system has a second order phase transition to an ordered antiferroelectric arrangement of ions @xcite means that we expect the analogous transition to occur for the case where the electrons can sit on alternate lattice sites with no quenched disorder .    comparing the ordered and disordered extremes reveals similarities and differences .",
    "both systems undergo a phase transition when the temperature is lowered . in the ordered case , the transition is to an ordered arrangement of electrons occupying every other site whereas in the disordered case the electrons are frozen into the highly disordered arrangement of a coulomb glass @xcite .",
    "both systems at low temperatures have a gap in their single particle density of states .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , systems with either positively charged sites ( missing electron ) or negatively charged sites ( electron present ) can be mapped onto ising spin-1/2 systems .",
    "a great deal of work has been done on ising models with long range interactions .",
    "the ferromagnetic or attractive ising model with power law interactions that fall off as @xmath4 without quenched disorder has been studied @xcite as a function of the dimension @xmath5 and the exponent @xmath6 for @xmath7 . however , in this paper we will focus on interacting electrons and so we are interested in the antiferromagnetic ising model .",
    "the presence of quenched disorder results in an ising spin glass .",
    "there has been a substantial amount of numerical effort to understand the energy of domain walls at @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite the energy of the domain wall goes as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the system size and the exponent @xmath11 is positive for systems with nonzero transition temperatures .",
    "work on the ising spin glass with power law interactions has been summarized in a couple of papers @xcite .",
    "the system has a rich phase diagram in the @xmath12 plane which can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath5 is the dimension and @xmath6 is the exponent of the power law interaction @xmath4 .",
    "the smaller @xmath6 is , the longer the range of the interaction .",
    "if the range is long enough or if the dimension is large enough , then there is a second order phase transition with a transition temperature @xmath13 .",
    "the critical exponents are different in the long range and short range regimes .",
    "the exponent @xmath11 depends continuously on @xmath6 in the long - range region ( @xmath14 ) , and is independent of @xmath6 in the short - range regime @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the critical exponents also depend continuously on @xmath6 in the long - range region , and are independent of @xmath6 in the short - range regime @xcite .",
    "katzgraber and young have done monte carlo simulations of an ising spin glass in one dimension with long range interactions @xcite .",
    "they chose a value for @xmath6 where the system has a second order spin glass transition , and they find that @xmath15 .    in this paper we will be concerned with what happens to thermodynamic quantities as we systematically introduce disorder into a three dimensional system of electrons with long range coulomb interactions . the disorder is introduced into the placement of sites where the electrons can sit . the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the hamiltonian and describe our monte carlo simulation . in section",
    "iii we present the quantities that we measure . in section",
    "iv we present our results , and we give our conclusions in section v.",
    "let us start by considering the completely disordered case which is known as a coulomb glass .",
    "the essential physics of the coulomb glass is the presence of both disorder and long range coulomb interactions between electrons .",
    "the hamiltonian often studied for the coulomb glass is @xcite @xmath16 where we set the charge @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the number operator for site @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the onsite energy , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is a compensating background charge making the whole system charge neutral .",
    "such a hamiltonian describes a lightly doped semiconductor , in which the impurity sites are far enough apart that the overlap between sites can be neglected . in most of the early work on the coulomb glass ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the sites are chosen to form a periodic lattice , and the disorder is present in the form of random onsite energies .",
    "for an ordered system , the onsite energy @xmath20 is a constant .",
    "one could imagine gradually introducing disorder by allowing @xmath20 to be chosen from a distribution whose width gradually increases .",
    "however , the presence of random onsite energies makes numerical analysis difficult , since even in the high temperature state the average occupation of a site is not zero .",
    "this makes the search for a phase transition difficult ; there is no obvious order parameter which becomes nonzero at the transition . for our numerical analysis ,",
    "it is more convenient to take the disorder to be entirely in the location of the sites .",
    "this changes the symmetry of the hamiltonian from having onsite disorder to having disorder in the interaction between sites because the distance between sites varies . for many quantities",
    "these two models give similar results .",
    "for example studies of the specific heat in coulomb glasses have compared having disorder in the onsite energy to having a completely random displacement of sites @xcite .",
    "they find that both models produce qualitatively similar results with some quantitative differences .",
    "however , the existence and nature of the phase transitions is different in the two models @xcite . in particular",
    "there is always a phase transition no matter how wide the distribution of the site placement is , whereas there is no phase transition if the width of the distribution of the onsite energy @xmath20 is larger than a critical value @xcite .",
    "mbius @xcite has argued that such a critical value must exist , even if it is vanishingly small , since there is a phase transition when there is no disorder @xcite while there is no clear evidence for a transition when there is substantial onsite disorder .",
    "this implies that long range order is destroyed by both onsite disorder and thermal fluctuations .",
    "a number of previous simulations have used the form for the hamiltonian with disorder in the placement of the sites @xcite . in the case of half filling",
    "there is a particle  hole symmetry , and the phase transition is associated with the development of a nonzero edwards - anderson order parameter @xcite .",
    "we therefore rewrite the hamiltonian ( taking @xmath23 ) to look like that of a spin glass , @xmath24 @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) will denote an occupied ( unoccupied ) site",
    ".    we have simulated three dimensional systems of linear size @xmath27 , 6 , and 8 .",
    "we place @xmath28 sites in the system .",
    "we have only considered the case of half filling in order to take advantage of the spin - flip symmetry . for the ordered case the sites form a cubic lattice . in the ground state",
    ", every other site is occupied ; the occupied sites form a face centered cubic ( fcc ) lattice .",
    "we can gradually introduce disorder by allowing the deviation of a site from its position in a cubic lattice to be chosen from a gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of @xmath29 .",
    "this gives the radial distance from the cubic lattice site .",
    "the angular coordinates of the site are chosen randomly using a uniform distribution .",
    "the ordered case corresponds to @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 corresponds to the very disordered case with a standard deviation equal to the cubic lattice constant @xmath32 .",
    "we also considered completely random arrangements of sites where the @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 coordinates of each are chosen from a uniform distribution .",
    "we call this the `` uniform random '' case .",
    "we find no qualitative difference and only a slight quantitative difference between the uniform random case and the @xmath31 case in quantities such as the single particle density of states , the specific heat versus temperature , and the binder s @xmath36 .",
    "so we will not make much mention of the uniform random case .",
    "we use infinite periodic boundary conditions in which the simulation box is infinitely replicated in all directions to form a lattice . as a result ,",
    "an electron on a given site interacts with other electrons and all their images via the coulomb interaction . to handle this",
    ", we use an ewald summation technique @xcite which replaces the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) with the following effective interaction between sites : @xmath37 where @xmath10 is the linear size of the simulation box , @xmath38 is the number of sites , the charge @xmath39 , and the function @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 in which @xmath42 is the complementary error function and @xmath43- \\frac{2\\alpha}{\\sqrt{\\pi } } \\label{eq : lambda}\\ ] ] note that @xmath44\\ ] ] the sum over @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda ] ) is a sum over all simple cubic lattice points with integer coordinates @xmath46 .",
    "these are the coordinates of the images of the simulation box .",
    "the parameter @xmath47 is a convergence factor that is adjusted to maximize the rate of convergence of the sum .",
    "we have omitted a positive term in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ewald ] ) that is proportional to the square of the net dipole moment of the configuration @xcite .",
    "this omission is equivalent to the boundary condition in which the infinite sphere of our system and its images is surrounded by a perfect conducting medium .",
    "we have done some runs with the dipole term and find no qualitative difference and only a slight quantitative difference compared to the case with no dipole term .",
    "so in this paper we will present the result of simulation runs which omit the dipole term .",
    "we have used a monte carlo heat bath algorithm .",
    "we keep a table of the potential energy at each site .",
    "each electron is looked at sequentially and moved to one of the available @xmath48 sites ( its own site or one of the available @xmath49 unoccupied sites ) , chosen with a boltzmann probability .",
    "if the site chosen is the electron s original location , the potential energies are unchanged ; if the electron hops to a new site , we update all the potential energies . if the electron chooses its initial site , which it does with high probability at low temperatures , we do not have to recompute the potential energies .",
    "this speeds up the simulation considerably , partially compensating for the much longer equilibration times needed at low temperatures .",
    "our longest run ( for @xmath27 at @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) had @xmath52 monte carlo steps per electron .",
    "depending on the system size and temperature , the sample averages involved between 5 and 190 disorder configurations .",
    "the edwards  anderson order parameter alluded to above quantifies the extent to which spins or site occupations are frozen .",
    "it is defined as @xmath53 $ ] ; we will denote thermal averages by @xmath54 and disorder averages by @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "thermal averages sum over fluctuations in the positions of the electrons weighted with the correct boltzmann probability ; disorder averages sum over different arrangements of the sites .",
    "we can see from the definition of @xmath56 that if the spins are frozen , then the average orientation of a spin will have a nonzero thermal average and @xmath56 will be finite .",
    "this is why @xmath56 can be thought of as the order parameter of the phase transition .",
    "we can generalize the edwards ",
    "anderson order parameter to a finite time overlap in either of two ways @xcite . the first way computes the overlap between two replicas : @xmath57 where the superscripts refer to different replicas . the two replicas are identical in their disorder , i.e. , the placement of the sites , but differ in the initial positions of the electrons .",
    "the other way uses the same replica at two different times @xmath58 if the time difference @xmath59 is sufficiently large that the electron configurations at @xmath60 and @xmath61 are essentially uncorrelated , @xmath62 will give the same result as the replica overlap .",
    "we use the moments of the overlap to define binder s @xmath36 which is a parameter that is related to the phase transition .",
    "first we define @xmath63 by @xcite @xmath64 } { \\left[\\langle q^2(\\tau ) \\rangle\\right]^2}\\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath65 we will use @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) to denote the result of using @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "binder s @xmath36 is given by @xmath70 which we will approximate by @xmath71 for some measurement time @xmath59 large enough that the configurations are essentially uncorrelated so that @xmath66 and @xmath67 agree .",
    "we have used this fact to monitor equilibration by simulating two replicas that have the same placement of sites but different spin configurations.@xcite typically @xmath72 increases with time to the equilibrium value , whereas @xmath73 decreases to the equilibrium value .",
    "the two methods agree when the system has reached equilibrium .",
    "our criterion for equilibration was that the values of @xmath67 and @xmath66 agreed to within 0.1 .",
    "we only present results for systems which meet this criterion .",
    "we should caution that this criterion can be met even though the system may still be slowly aging .",
    "binder s @xmath36 provides a way to monitor the phase transition . at high temperatures",
    ", the distribution of @xmath56 tends to a gaussian so that @xmath74 , whereas the order parameter , and hence @xmath36 , become nonzero as the temperature approaches the phase transition temperature @xmath0 . if we make the assumption of one parameter scaling , then the only relevant length is the correlation length @xmath75 where @xmath1 is the critical exponent associated with @xmath76 .",
    "so all lengths , including @xmath10 , can be scaled by @xmath76 .",
    "since @xmath36 is dimensionless , we expect that it should satisfy a scaling form @xcite @xmath77 thus at the critical temperature , @xmath78 should have the same value independent of the system size @xmath10 ( as long as @xmath10 is sufficiently large for finite size scaling to apply).@xcite      there are two ways to calculate the specific heat @xmath79 .",
    "the first way uses the variance of the energy fluctuations : @xmath80 \\label{eq : sphtvar}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the average energy per electron , @xmath38 is the number of electrons , and @xmath82 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "the other way to calculate the specific heat is to take the derivative of the energy with respect to temperature .",
    "we can approximate the derivative by a finite temperature difference @xmath83}{\\partial t}\\right|_{t_i } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\approx & \\frac{\\left[\\langle e(t_{i+1})\\rangle\\right]- \\left[\\langle e(t_{i})\\rangle\\right]}{\\left(t_{i+1}-t_{i}\\right ) } \\label{eq : sphtder}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we found that the specific heat calculated in these two ways agreed quite well .",
    "notice however , that if the slope of @xmath81 versus @xmath84 is increasing as temperature increases , then the specific heat calculated by the finite difference method will underestimate @xmath85 which is actually the slope of the tangent to the energy curve .",
    "similarly , if the slope of @xmath81 versus @xmath84 is decreasing as the temperature increases , the finite difference method will overestimate @xmath85 .",
    "since an unoccupied site on a cubic lattice corresponds to a down ising spin and an occupied site to an up ising spin , the fcc crystalline phase corresponds to a maximum in the magnitude of the staggered occupation @xmath86 .",
    "the staggered occupation is defined by @xcite @xmath87 where @xmath19 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 are the integer coordinates of the sites in a cubic lattice in units of the lattice constant @xmath32 .",
    "so a site coordinate @xmath90 .",
    "since disorder is introduced through a distribution in the position of the sites with respect to the cubic lattice sites , we can still use eq .",
    "( [ eq : stagmag ] ) to calculate the staggered occupation in the presence of disorder by regarding @xmath19 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 as coordinates of the center of the unit cell where the site is located .",
    "it is useful to plot the staggered occupation distribution @xmath91 versus @xmath86 in order to see the extent of the `` crystalline '' order . in order to compare different system sizes ,",
    "we normalize the staggered occupation to range from @xmath26 to @xmath92 , and the area under the curve is normalized to 1 .",
    "we have calculated the single particle density of states @xmath93 at various temperatures .",
    "@xmath93 is the distribution of potential energies at single sites due to interactions with all the other sites .",
    "in other words , we can write the hamiltonian in the form of an ising model : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the single site energy or `` local field '' and is given by @xmath96 @xmath93 is the thermally averaged and disorder averaged distribution of @xmath95 .",
    "we consider the case where the translational degrees of freedom are discrete and the electrons can only sit on designated sites .",
    "this is equivalent to a long range ising model in three dimensions . if the sites are ordered and are lattice sites , it is also equivalent to the lattice restricted primitive model ( lrpm ) in the completely filled case ( ionic density @xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "we find that discretization produces a second order phase transition regardless of the amount of positional disorder . in this section",
    "we present evidence that the ordered case with @xmath30 undergoes a second order crystallization transition to an fcc lattice as the temperature is lowered .",
    "this result is consistent with the second order transition found by mbius and rler @xcite from numerical simulations of a half  filled system on a cubic lattice with coulomb interactions .",

    "this behavior has been seen in the case of a 3state ferromagnetic potts model in three dimensions which undergoes a first order phase transition @xcite . however , in that case the value of @xmath36 at the minimum scaled as @xmath105 , whereas in our case @xmath106 appears to saturate at large @xmath10 .",
