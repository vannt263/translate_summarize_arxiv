    "while early observations of this gas made in x - rays supported this picture , observations of the clusters at other wavelengths did not .",
    "optical data implied star formation rates in the central galaxy of only a few percent of the derived cooling rates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and radio observations found less cold gas than predicted ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , recent high - resolution x - ray spectra from xmm-_newton _ do not show the features expected if large amounts of gas are cooling below @xmath7 kev @xcite .",
    "in addition , high spatial resolution _",
    "chandra _ x - ray observatory images reveal that agn can have a large heating effect ( via jets and winds ) on the icm , supplying enough heat in some systems to offset radiation losses @xcite .",
    "the emerging picture of cooling flows is one in which most ( but not all ) of the cooling is roughly balanced by heating from agn feedback , resulting in a moderate cooling flow ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    in this regulated - cooling scenario , net cooling from the icm would lead to condensation of gas onto the central galaxy , driving the star formation observed in many systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if this scenario is correct , the star formation rates should on average be comparable to the rate of gas observed to be condensing out of the icm .",
    "studies of a small number of systems with reliable star formation and cooling rates have shown that the rates are converging , and in some cases are in rough agreement ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the quality and quantity of data from _ chandra _ and xmm-_newton _ now makes it possible to construct a significantly larger sample of such systems to better understand the possible connection between star formation and net cooling in cooling flow clusters",
    ".    additionally , the high - resolution data from _ chandra _ are useful in studies of the nature of the feedback mechanism that may be preventing large amounts of intracluster gas from cooling .",
    "chandra images of galaxy clusters have revealed many large - scale interactions between the icm and the central agn , the best - known examples of which are the perseus cluster @xcite , abell 2052 @xcite , and hydra  a @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "the radio jets of the agn have pushed out cavities in the cluster s atmosphere , creating surface - brightness depressions in x - ray images that are correlated with the lobes radio emission , such that the radio emission fills the depression in x - rays .",
    "the lower emissivities of the depressions imply that they are low - density cavities in the icm , and therefore should rise buoyantly in the cluster s atmosphere @xcite . by measuring the surrounding pressure and volume of the cavities using the x - ray data",
    ", one can derive the work done by the radio source on the icm in inflating the cavities , giving a direct measurement of the non - radiative energy released during the outburst .",
    "measurements of this energy , combined with measurements of the star formation and cooling rates , can be used to investigate possible feedback scenarios that may govern the growth of the central dominant galaxy ( cdg , as distinct from the more strictly defined cd ) and its central supermassive black hole .",
    "such feedback has implications for the more general problem of galaxy formation .",
    "the large - scale distribution of mass in the universe is well modeled by the standard hierarchical cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology @xcite . in this model ,",
    "larger dark matter halos form through the merging of smaller ones , while their gravitationally bound baryons cool and condense into the progenitors of the galaxies we see today @xcite .",
    "this picture successfully explains much of the observed matter distribution .",
    "however , a persistent problem in simulations that include only gravitational heating is a failure to reproduce the truncation of the high - luminosity end of the galaxy luminosity function @xcite .",
    "this problem stems from excessive cooling of baryons in the cores of halos , resulting in a population of massive galaxies , far larger than even the enormous cd galaxies at the cores of clusters @xcite . instead of residing in the cd galaxy as predicted by simulations ,",
    "most baryons are found in the hot icm .",
    "this problem may have a solution in non - gravitational heating by supernovae and agn .",
    "supernovae are essential for enriching the icm to observed levels @xcite and may play a significant heating role in smaller galaxies , but their feedback energies are too small and localized to truncate cooling in massive galaxies @xcite . furthermore , in the closely related preheating problem , they have difficulty supplying enough heat to boost the entropy level of the hot gas to the observed levels @xcite . energetically , agn heating appears to be the most likely mechanism to severely reduce the supply of gas from the hot icm in galaxies above a certain size and to explain observed entropy profiles @xcite .",
    "current theory posits that agn are powered by the accretion of material onto a central black hole .",
    "gravitational binding energy of the accreting material powers radiation and outflows from agn as the black hole grows .",
    "the relativistic jets that are revealed by their synchrotron emission are a product of this process .",
    "the remaining accreting material goes to increasing the mass of the black hole . in a sense ,",
    "agn are the `` smoking guns '' of black hole growth .",
    "the fraction of accreted power that re - emerges from an agn and its partitioning between radiation and outflows is not well understood , but probably depends on accretion rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we can place lower limits on the agn s power using estimates of the power required to create the cavities associated with the radio lobes .",
    "this power may then be used to infer the minimum growth rate of the black hole .    as presented by @xcite and @xcite",
    ", a correlation exists between the mass of the central black hole ( @xmath8 ) and the velocity dispersion ( @xmath9 ) of the galaxy s bulge .",

    "estimates of the current growth rates of the black hole may be compared to the large - scale properties of the galaxy ( such as the star formation rate ) to trace the present day impact of bulge and black hole growth on this connection .    in this paper",

    "the energy required to create the cavities requires an accretion mass , @xmath248 of @xmath249 the value of @xmath247 depends on poorly understood details of the jet production process and , probably , on black hole spin . under the usual assumption , that the maximum energy that can be extracted is determined by the binding energy of the last stable orbit , the upper limit on the efficiency ranges from @xmath250 for a nonrotating black hole to @xmath251 for an extreme kerr black hole @xcite .",
    "we assume when calculating the energy of the outburst that each cavity represents @xmath234 of energy ( i.e.  that they are filled with a relativistic plasma ) .",
    "since some of the accreting material s mass goes to power the jets , the black hole s mass grows by @xmath252 therefore , increased efficiency results in smaller black hole growth for a given outburst energy .",

    "in addition to observational and modeling inhomogeneities across our sample , a number of uncertainties exist in any derivation of the star formation rate .",

    "the agreement between the x  ray - derived rates is reasonably good , as is their agreement with the uv - derived fuse rates .",
    "we note , however , that the _ chandra _ rates appear to be systematically lower than the other two rates , possibly due to spatial and spectral resolution effects or calibration and modeling differences .",
    "it should be emphasized that neither the _ chandra _ nor xmm-_newton _ rates are based on fits to emission lines from gas cooling to low temperatures ; rather , they are both based on fits to the continuum .",
    "additionally , models fit to x - ray spectra do not generally require a cooling component to obtain an adequate fit .",
    "therefore , x  ray - derived cooling rates should be interpreted as the _ maximum rates of cooling consistent with the spectra and not as unequivocal detections of cooling_. until line emission that is uniquely due to cooling below 1 kev is identified , cooling through this temperature at any level can not be confirmed ( see however * ? ? ?",
    "* who find possible weak detections of several cooling lines in xmm-_newton _ data of a2597 ) .",
    "however , the reasonably close correspondence between fuse and x  ray - derived rates indicates that cooling is occurring at or just below the detection limits .",
    "x - ray cavities provide a strong lower limit on the energy of the agn outburst , independent of accretion disk radiation models and photon conversion efficiencies .",
    "therefore they provide a robust means of estimating the minimum mass accreted onto the black hole .",
    "these properties allow us to investigate the relationship between the black hole s growth and the bulge s local ( small - scale ) growth in the same systems in a unique and detailed fashion that has not been possible before .",

    "therefore , under the assumption that star formation traces all of the bulge s growth , consistency with general relativity and the slope of the magorrian relation requires that all objects with estimates of the _ total _ star formation rate fall below the @xmath527 line in figure [ f : sfr_mdot ] .",
    "this requirement is clearly violated in a number of objects .",
    "for example , the black holes in both hydra  a and a2052 are growing faster than strict adherence to the magorrian relation would predict , whereas the bulge of a1068 is growing too fast ( note , however , that no cavities were detected in a1068 s atmosphere ; therefore , there is large uncertainty in the rate of growth of a1068 s black hole ) .",
    "while the discrepancy in a1068 s rates may be explained with an extremely low efficiency for the conversion of gravitational binding energy of the accreting material to outburst energy ( @xmath528 ) , it is also possible that present - day growth is occurring in spurts , with periods of cooling and star formation ( as in a1068 ) in which the bulge grows quickly with little commensurate black hole growth , while during periods of heating ( as in hydra a ) the black hole grows more quickly than the bulge .    the trend in figure",
    "[ f : sfr_mdot ] may be interpreted as an indication that , in a time - averaged sense , the growth of the bulges and black holes in our sample proceeds roughly along the magorrian relation . when compared to the bulge masses calculated in section [ s : sfr_analysis ] and the black hole masses calculated in section [ s : bh ] , the black holes are growing at rates of @xmath529 yr@xmath4 and the bulges at rates of @xmath530 yr@xmath4 .",
    "present - day growth would not move most of the systems significantly off of the magorrian relation , even if growth at such rates was constant for the age of the universe .",
    "however , for a number of systems , current growth could produce their present - day black holes in @xmath531 yr .",
    "the three most extreme cases ( ms 0735.6 + 7421 , zw 2701 , and zw 3146 ) have growth rates that , if constant over just @xmath509 yr , would be sufficient to grow their black holes to their current masses . periodic and powerful outbursts , without commensurate bulge growth ( e.g. , ms 0735.6 + 7421 ) , could cause significant departures from the magorrian relation .",
    "these three systems represent @xmath510% of our sample , implying a duty cycle in active systems of one such outburst every @xmath532 yr .",
    "large outbursts might shut off cooling ( and hence fueling ) for long periods , making them a relatively rare event ( see * ? ? ?",
    "if the most powerful outbursts are infrequent in the present - day universe , the magorrian relation must have been established during earlier periods of extreme black hole and bulge growth , as has been postulated by a number of authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and supported by high - redshift quasar studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "lastly , it is possible that we are missing some fraction of the bulge growth . the cdg is thought to grow through the addition of material by two main processes : cooling of gas out of the icm ( see section [ s : x - ray_analysis ] ) and merging ( cannibalism ) of the cdg with other cluster members .",
    "the rate of growth from mergers is difficult to measure .",
    "@xcite , through a study of multiple - nucleus cdgs , estimated a cannibalism rate of @xmath533 per @xmath534 yr .",
    "this estimate implies that such growth is significant over the age of the cluster ; however , the time scale for this growth is much longer than the cooling and star formation time scales considered here .",
    "therefore , we have neglected mergers and used the star formation rates described in section [ s : sfr_analysis ] to set the instantaneous bulge growth rate .      to investigate whether the growth of the black hole , or equivalently the energy of its outburst , depends on its mass ( inferred",
    "assuming bulges come equipped with mature black holes , see section [ s : bh_masses ] ) , we plot in figure [ f : mbh_deltambh ] the fractional change in the black hole s mass during the outburst ( @xmath535 ) against its mass .",
    "there is no clear indication in figure [ f : mbh_deltambh ] that the growth of the black hole depends on the black hole mass , at least to the extent that the bulge velocity dispersion or luminosity is a good black hole mass estimator for these systems .",
    "for example , systems that differ by a factor of two in inferred black hole mass , such as m84 ( @xmath536 @xmath254 ) and ms 0735.6 + 7421 ( @xmath537 @xmath254 ) , differ in their fractional growth by a factor of @xmath538 .",
    "however , uncertainties in the black hole and accreted masses may obscure any underlying correlation .    for a number of objects in our sample , the implied accretion rates necessary to generate the cavities are well above our bondi accretion rates ( by factors of up to @xmath539 see table [ t : bh_masses ] and figure [",
    "f : bondi ] ) . specifically , those systems with the most powerful outbursts appear to have the largest bondi ratios , as should be expected from the small range in black hole masses .",
    "however , as discussed in section [ s : edd_bondi_rates ] , we do not resolve the bondi radius .",
    "therefore , our bondi rates are probably lower that the true values , particularly in higher redshift objects and those observations with a low number of total counts ( resulting in a larger central region to obtain @xmath417 counts ) .    to illustrate the radial dependence of this correction , we plot in figure [ f : bondi ] the ratio of the accretion to bondi rate versus the semi - major axis of the central region from which the bondi rates were calculated , normalized to the bondi radius .",
    "the trend in this figure supports the conclusion that the bondi radius is not resolved .",
    "overplotted are lines denoting the scaling of the measured bondi ratio with radius , assuming a true bondi ratio of unity at the bondi radius and a density profile that rises as @xmath5 to the bondi radius ( upper line ) or flattens inside @xmath540 ( lower line ) , as observed in m87 @xcite .",
    "objects near or below these lines could reasonably have ratios of order unity or less and thus be consistent with bondi accretion .",
    "those significantly above the lines are likely to be accreting in excess of their bondi rates .",
    "all of the objects in our sample are consistent with bondi accretion , but only if the density continues to rise as a powerlaw to the bondi radius .",
    "the accretion rates in those objects with the least powerful outbursts ( such as m84 and m87 ) are generally consistent with bondi ratios of significantly less than unity .",
    "this conclusion is supported by @xcite , who find that accretion rates in ellipticals with low - power outbursts are consistent with bondi accretion .    however , a number of objects ( typically those with powerful outbursts , such as ms 0735.6 + 7421 and zw 2701 ) are barely consistent with bondi accretion and would have difficulty fueling their outbursts through bondi accretion alone , suggesting some other route for much of the accreting material , such as cold accretion ( e.g. , the cold feedback mechanism of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "additionally , the bondi accretion rate assumes spherically symmetric , radial accretion , while real astrophysical flows will have some net angular momentum .",
    "an example is m87 , which appears to posses a central disk of gas @xcite ; thus , any accreting material would be likely to have significant angular momentum ( for a discussion , see * ? ? ?",
    "recent hydrodynamic simulations of accretion flows ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) find that even small amounts of angular momentum can reduce the accretion rate to well below the bondi rate .",
    "it is also possible that the bondi rates ( and hence central densities ) in these objects were higher at the time of the outburst than they are now .",
    "we note however that very high densities imply very short cooling times . at sufficiently high densities ,",
    "the gas will cool and fall out of the hot phase in which bondi accretion operates , placing an upper limit on the density appropriate for use in the bondi calculation ( the maximal cooling flow , see * ? ? ?",
    "for example , to fuel the outbursts in ms 0735.6 + 7421 and zw 2701 by bondi accretion alone , the accretion rate would need to be very close to the maximal cooling flow value ( @xmath510% of the eddington rate for these objects , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , this constraint is not severe enough to rule out bondi accretion as a viable accretion mechanism in most of our sample .",
    "we wish to test the hypothesis that star formation is fueled by gas condensing out of the icm .",
    "if true , and cooling and star formation vary slowly with time , their rates should be comparable to each other . to make this comparison , we plot the net cooling ( condensation ) rate against the star formation rate in figure [ f : sfr_mdotc ] .",
    "symbols denote the various types of data used to derive the star formation rate ( see section [ s : sfr_analysis ] ) .",
    "the cooling rates include estimates inferred from xmm-_newton _ x - ray spectra and from fuse ultraviolet spectra ( see section [ s : net_cooling ] ) , and from our _ chandra _ data ( see section [ s : cooling_analysis ] ) . in almost all cases , the x  ray - derived cooling rates",
    "should be considered upper limits , since indisputable evidence of cooling below @xmath3 kev has yet to be found in the x - ray emission from cooling flow clusters .",
    "the apparent trend should be interpreted cautiously in this context ( see caveats in section [ s : net_cooling ] ) .",
    "figure [ f : sfr_mdotc ] shows the condensation and star formation rates for all systems in our sample are consistent with the hypothesis that star formation is fueled by gas condensing out of the icm .",
    "the average ratio of condensation to star formation rate for those rates derived in similar apertures is @xmath541 , using xmm-_newton _ and fuse rates ( the ratio does not change significantly if _ chandra _ rates are considered ) .",
    "this value is similar to that found by @xcite in a study of star formation and cooling using xmm-_newton _ uv monitor data .",
    "figure [ f : sfr_mdotc ] shows that the rates of star formation and cooling have converged greatly and are in rough agreement in several systems .",
    "the classical cooling flow problem , in which the x  ray - derived cooling rates were factors of @xmath542 in excess of the star formation rates in most systems , has largely disappeared . while the average discrepancy of four to one is still large",
    ", it is of the order of the uncertainty in the rates .",
    "factors that may contribute to scatter in the rates are time - dependent effects such as radio - triggered star formation @xcite and the time lag required for gas at @xmath543  k to cool and form stars .",
    "lastly , it is clear that if star formation is being fueled by the icm , firm detections of cooling out of the x - ray band should be within reach of present and future x - ray observatories for those objects with large star formation rates @xcite .",
    "even with present - day instruments , the upper limits on cooling derived to date are very close to the inferred total star formation rates for a number of objects ( e.g. , a1835 ) .",
    "if this star formation scenario is to survive , future deep x - ray observations of these objects ( with constellation - x , for example ) should detect this cooling gas .",
    "we have demonstrated that , in many systems , the net icm cooling ( condensation ) rate is in rough agreement with total star formation rate .",
    "however , we have not dealt with the question of what maintains the bulk of the icm at x - ray temperatures , preventing it from cooling out at the expected classical rates ( typically @xmath544 times the star formation rates ) .",
    "agn heating , through cavities , shocks , and sound waves , has emerged as the favored mechanism to prevent this massive cooling in cooling flows . to investigate whether agn cavities are powerful enough to balance the radiation emitted by the icm , we plot in figure [ f : lcool_lcav ] the cavity power of the central agn against the total radiative luminosity of the intracluster gas within the cooling radius ( minus the luminosity due to net cooling , given in table [ t : properties ] ) .",
    "this plot supersedes figure 2 of @xcite , to whose sample we have added deeper x - ray data and 14 new cavity systems , most of which lie in the upper half of cavity powers .    remarkably , most of the systems in our sample have cavity powers sufficient or nearly sufficient to balance the entire radiative losses of the icm within the cooling radius .",
    "the remaining systems may require other forms of heat to offset cooling completely , such as thermal conduction @xcite . however , we note that the time - dependent nature of agn feedback does not require that cooling is always balanced by heating .",
    "it is possible that those systems that do not currently balance are in a cooling phase and will be entering a heating phase soon .",
    "intermittent heating and cooling would allow for cooling and star formation at observed levels .    in figure",
    "[ f : lcool_lcav ] , a number of systems lie well above the @xmath234 line and even above the @xmath545 line , implying that their cavities likely represent more energy than required to balance cooling . these systems , many of which possess supercavities and shocks extending beyond the cooling radius , have enough energy to quench cooling and to contribute to cluster preheating .",
    "an example is ms 0735.6 + 7421 , the most powerful such outburst know to date .",
    "the agn in this cluster has dumped @xmath546 kev per particle into the icm ( including the energy of the shock ; * ? ? ?",
    "the cavities alone have enough energy to quench cooling 15 times over .",
    "this amount of energy , even if distributed only partly inside the cooling radius , should have a profound effect on any cooling gas .",
    "such objects may thus be in a heating phase .",
    "however , unresolved problems still remain , the most obvious of which is the absence of cavities and star formation in many cooling flow systems .",
    "the absence of cavities currently does not however rule out significant feedback in the past .",
    "@xcite find elevated entropy levels throughout the cooling region of both cooling - flow clusters that show evidence of agn feedback and those that do not , consistent with a history of agn feedback in all cooling flows .",
    "secondly , in cooling flows that lack evidence of agn heating , other sources of heat , such as thermal conduction , may be important .",
    "lastly , the most powerful explosions , such as seen in ms 0735.6 + 7421 , may turn off accretion and hence agn activity for extended periods .",
    "we have presented an analysis of the star formation and agn properties in 33 cdgs in the cores of cooling flows .",
    "we find that the agn outbursts in most of the systems have enough energy to offset most of the radiative losses of the icm , and to severely reduce cooling to levels that are approaching the star formation rates in the central galaxy . using the cavities to infer black hole growth and star formation to infer bulge growth",
    ", we find that bulge and black hole growth rates scale roughly with each other in rough accordance with the slope of the magorrian relation .",
    "the large scatter may indicate that growth occurs in spurts , with periods of cooling and star formation interspaced with periods of heating , or that the efficiency of the conversion of the gravitational binding energy of the accreting matter to outburst energy varies across the sample .",
    "we find the central supermassive black holes are growing at rates of @xmath547 @xmath548 yr@xmath4 to @xmath3 @xmath548 yr@xmath4 ( with a median rate of 0.035 @xmath548 yr@xmath4 ) , which , in most of our sample , are insufficient to account for their present - day masses .",
    "however , a number of black holes are growing at rates that are consistent with their formation from scratch in @xmath549 yr .",
    "the extreme cases are those objects experiencing the most powerful outbursts ( @xmath550 ergs s@xmath2 approximately 10% of our sample ) , which are growing at rates sufficient to assemble their black holes in @xmath509 yr .    across our sample ,",
    "the inferred black hole accretion rates are well below their eddington limits but above their bondi rates .",
    "_ chandra _ does not resolve the bondi radius in these systems , and thus significant bondi accretion can not be ruled out .",
    "the exceptions are those systems with powerful outbursts , where either direct accretion from the hot icm is not the principle route of cooling gas or their central properties were very different at the time of the outburst than those of typical nearby cdgs such as m87 .",
    "we test the scenario that the active star formation is fueled by cooling ( condensation ) from the icm .",
    "we find that star formation and cooling rates are converging ( to an average ratio of cooling to total star formation rate of four to one ) , and in some cases are consistent with one another .",
    "inhomogeneities in star formation rates and the lack of firm detections of cooling in x - ray data are the main factors that limit our conclusions .",
    "nevertheless , this rough agreement is far different from the situation a decade ago , when the best x - ray cooling rates were tens to hundreds of times the star formation rates .",
    "using the best x - ray data to date , we extend and revise the heating versus cooling plot of @xcite .",
    "remarkably , we find that agn heating , as traced by the power in x - ray cavities alone , is capable of balancing the radiative losses of the icm in more than half of the systems in our sample .",
    "however , the means by which the agn s jet energy is converted to heat in the icm and the efficiency of this conversion are not yet clear ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". additionally , our estimate of agn heating neglects other significant sources of heat that are likely to be present in many of the systems in our sample , such as weak shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , sound waves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thermal conduction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "all of these heat sources may play a role in maintaining the rough balance of heating to cooling observed to exist throughout the cooling region .",
    "agn , however , have emerged as the most important heating mechanism in cooling flows .",
    "a unified picture of star formation , cooling , and agn feedback is now emerging , one with applications to the more general problems of galaxy formation and the truncation of the high end of the luminosity function of galaxies . both simulations and models of galaxy formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) conclude that agn heating is required to prevent the overcooling problem in cdm models , in which too many large galaxies are formed .",
    "a plausible scenario is that agn regulate the cooling of gas in the cores of cooling flows , preventing most of the icm from cooling but allowing some net condensation that feeds both star formation and black hole growth , possibly in an intermittent manner , along the magorrian relation .    in summary",
    ", we find that star formation and cooling rates and agn outburst energies for our sample of cdgs are broadly consistent with the simple agn - icm feedback scenario in which gas cooling out of the icm feeds agn outbursts that heat the gas in the cluster s core . some low - level",

    "<S> we present an analysis of the growth of black holes through accretion and bulges through star formation in 33 galaxies at the centers of cooling flows . </S>",
    "<S> most of these systems show evidence of cavities in the intracluster medium ( icm ) inflated by radio jets emanating from their active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . </S>",
    "<S> we present a new and extensive analysis of x - ray cavities in these systems . </S>",
    "<S> we find that agn are energetically able to balance radiative losses ( cooling ) from the icm in more than half of our sample . </S>",
    "<S> using a subsample of 17 systems , we examine the relationship between cooling and star formation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the star formation rates are approaching or are comparable to x - ray and far uv limits on the rates of gas condensation onto the central galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining radiative losses could be offset by agn feedback . </S>",
    "<S> the vast gulf between radiative losses and the sink of cooling material , which has been the primary objection to cooling flows , has narrowed and , in some cases , is no longer a serious issue . using the cavity ( jet ) powers , we place strong lower limits on the rate of growth of supermassive black holes in central galaxies , and we find that they are growing at an average rate of @xmath0 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 with some systems growing as quickly as @xmath3 m@xmath1 yr@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we find a trend between bulge growth ( star formation ) and black hole growth that is approximately in accordance with the slope of the local ( magorrian ) relation between black hole and bulge mass . </S>",
    "<S> however , the large scatter in the trend suggests that bulges and black holes do not always grow in lock step . with the exception of the rapidly accreting supercavity systems </S>",
    "<S> ( e.g , ms 0735.6 + 7421 ) , the black holes are accreting well below their eddington rates . </S>",
    "<S> most systems could be powered by bondi accretion from the hot icm , provided the central gas density increases into the bondi radius as @xmath5 . however , </S>",
    "<S> if the slope of the gas density profile flattens into a core , as observed in m87 , bondi accretion is unlikely to be driving the most powerful outbursts . </S>"
