    "in the early stages of a petroleum reservoir development ( exploration or appraisal stages ) only sparse data is available , leading to inaccurate knowledge about that reservoir .",
    "basically , these data comes from geologic maps , seismic surveys and a few wells .",
    "the latter has the highest costs .",
    "it is not so critical to get robust knowledge in terms of quantity , but of quality .",
    "the location of new wells ( which accounts for a great economic risk ) will deeply depend on that knowledge , hence being so important to measure , in some way its , accuracy , through what its commonly called uncertainty assessment .    in these stages , uncertainty is related to those few drilled wells and their location , to the stratigraphic interpretation obtained from core analysis and seismic data .",
    "geostatistical modeling starts with only these sparse data .",
    "possible geological scenarios are conceived gathering this information , but only part of it is retained to build conceptual models .",
    "these models are the starting point of the ( re)definition of the drilling strategy ( wells number and location ) , and therefore assessing uncertainty related to these models is fundamental for the field development . in this work",
    "a method is proposed to assess the uncertainty derived from these conceptual models .",
    "the proposed approach to characterize conceptual models relies on two statistic techniques : spatial bootstrap , a resampling technique ; and bayesian update , an inference method based on bayes theorem .",
    "this approach is applied in a case study based on a middle east reservoir , where its porosity is the analyzed variable .",
    "we try to mimic the industry general methodology , starting with obtaining synthetic wells and building hypothetic scenarios ( conceptual models ) upon them .",
    "once the first wells are drilled , the available data only allows a rough estimate of the given property ( porosity , in this case ) .",
    "one way to assess the uncertainty of that estimate is to statistically analyze several realizations of the same estimator , i.e. , new samples . in the petroleum context",
    ", new wells can not be drilled from the real reservoir to assess uncertainty , since new samples would require drilling new wells , which accounts for a high economic risk ( high uncertainty and high cost per drill ) .",
    "bootstrap consists in a resampling technique which allows to measure the accuracy of an estimator discarding the need to acquire new realizations of that estimator .",
    "new samples are obtained by random sampling with replacement .",
    "this method can only be applied to independent variables , which is not convenient in a reservoir context where data are spatially correlated , as in earth sciences in general . when resampling wells , the correlation should be preserved as well as the redundancy between and along wells . spatial bootstrap",
    "is then applied to overcome this limitation , which is accomplished by preserving the drilling strategy , i.e. , the number and relative positions between wells are honored .",
    "similarly to the usual procedure followed in practice , an initial estimate is assumed as an hypothesis for each scenario .",
    "this value corresponds to a prior probability , which will then be transformed into a posterior probability through the inversion of the bayes theorem ( bayesian update ) , where spatial bootstrap is the key to calculate the likelihood .",
    "different realities and different scenarios are integrated , resulting in an uncertainty model which considers the ignorance about what is assumed to be the reservoir structural model .",
    "the main goal of the exploration or appraisal stages is to find structures in the earth crust which are favorable for oil retention .",
    "exploration consists in acquiring data ( geological , geophysical or geochemical ) , in its analysis , and in the placement of an initial exploration well ( called _ wildcat _ ) .",
    "this research can take place in some area not yet exploited or in the neighborhood of known fields , whereas in the second case they are called appraisal wells , serving the propose of finding structures associated to those fields .",
    "these initial wells are the only way one can validate the exploration conceptual model , providing the only practical evidence about a specific characteristic @xcite .",
    "uncertainty is a measure of the ignorance we have about the physical phenomena which has occurred in a reservoir .",
    "assessing reservoir properties and uncertainty through sparse appraisal data is a complex challenge .",
    "particularly , the uncertainty assessment in a exploration or appraisal project should strive to answer the following two problems :    1 .",
    "limited number of samples and limited knowledge about physical phenomena ; 2 .   usually , the uncertainty related to the conceptual models is not taken into account .",
    "various algorithms have been developed to calculate one unique best estimate of a global unknown value , however , assessing uncertainty requires the subjective definition of a randomization process .",
    "for instance , even when using stochastic simulation methods for quantifying the uncertainty degree of a geological model , through alternative and equiprobable representations , the uncertainty of the parameters , which have defined the geological model itself ( e.g. , variography ) , it is not quantified , because there was no place to consider other possibilities .",
    "a joint randomization of both the unknown variable and its estimate within a bayesian framework , given a set of alternative but plausible geological scenarios , allows to account the uncertainty of the initial estimate and the geological model .",
    "bayesian update integrated with spatial bootstrap turns possible the uncertainty space creation for the conceptual models .",
    "although the developed methodology sees its major application in the context of the early stages of the petroleum reservoirs development , either by data scarcity or high associated costs ( risk ) , its applicability might be extensible to other areas of knowledge .",
    "the developed methodology is divided into two main groups , related to the concepts previously referred : spatial bootstrap and bayesian update .",
    "data will be produced in the first group and then processed in the second one .",
    "a specific estimator can be optimal to estimate lower values of a given property , but have a different behavior for middle or higher values .",
    "that possible trend can be verified through the definition of classes .",
    "these classes provide a range of values for the probabilities calculation , i.e. , we are looking for the probability of the value of porosity which occurs between a specific range , instead of being equal to a specific value . that class can also relate to a range of interest , which in the petroleum context can correspond to ``",
    "be '' or `` not to be '' reservoir . from a general point of view , it is possible to know better the behavior of an estimator through the definition of @xmath0 classes @xmath1 .",
    "spatial bootstrap is a resampling technique , derived from the bootstrap method by @xcite .",
    "it is used to evaluate some specific statistic about a random variable @xmath2 . spatial correlation between samples",
    "is preserved , while classical bootstrap does not account for spatial dependence .    in the spatial bootstrapping practice , as suggested by @xcite , stochastic simulations are run in order to obtain multiple realizations using the same set of parameters , which means that the structural model is not randomized .",
    "the same author proposed randomizing the simulation algorithm , retaining the _ real _ value considered . in this approach , we use a spatial bootstrapping following , in some way , that suggestion , but instead of randomizing the simulation algorithm , we randomize the related variography ( conceptual model ) . the introduced difference allows embedding different possible interpretations , given the sampling data .    considering @xmath3 different variograms , we obtain different maps ( each one with different spatial continuities ) , which will correspond to different realities @xmath4 . in the context of this work , each resampling @xmath5 corresponds to the drilling of @xmath6 sets of @xmath7 synthetic wells on each one of the realities @xmath4 .",
    "spatial bootstrapping procedure ends with this resampling . in the present work we propose a different approach .",
    "stochastic simulations within spatial bootstrap are seen as realities , @xmath4 , and the different scenarios , @xmath8 , are defined by other simulations made upon the synthetic wells @xmath5 .",
    "the number of simulations per each set @xmath9 , with @xmath10 , is the number of considered variograms , @xmath3 .    with this procedure",
    "we can obtain the likelihood instead of using some random analytic distribution .",
    "prior probability , @xmath11 , corresponds to the probability of the occurrence of values of porosity within the class @xmath0 , given the scenario @xmath12 .",
    "its definition is related to an initial hypothesis .",
    "that hypothesis can be derived from other informations previously acquired ( e.g. , seismic ) and/or from expertise and available knowledge about some specific reservoir .    in this case ,",
    "none of these are available , so we describe two ways to assign values to the prior probability . with the first one , the initial hypothesis comes from spatial bootstrap samplings .",
    "frequentist probability is calculated for each one of the `` real '' maps .",
    "going through each one of the @xmath13 sets of sampled wells , block by block , and considering the event of interest as the value of porosity being within the range defined for each class ( eq . [ eq : priori1 ] ) .",

    ", successive values were assigned to the prior probability , depending on the real value at each `` real '' map , @xmath17 , where @xmath3 corresponds to different conceptual models ( eq . [ eq : priori2 ] ) .",

    "one should consider , in such interpretation , the effect of similitude between images , i.e. , likelihood .",
    "very similar images will have high values of likelihood , which , in turn , tend to higher posterior probability values .",
    "those updated values will be higher , thus increasing deviation .",
    "it results in high deviations in images which are similar by default .",
    "this leads to a difficult comparison between deviations related to different `` real '' maps , namely , between images generated with different number of wells , since the similitude between the real image and scenarios tends to be higher when the number of wells put into the simulation is also higher .",

    "we presented a methodology for uncertainty assessment in the early stages of a petroleum reservoir development .",
    "it can be said that in these stages there are two common difficulties : ( a ) available data are sparse and making decisions under such conditions has a high associated risk ; ( b ) conceptual models are usually assumed as exempt of uncertainty , although it should be considered .",
    "this methodology incorporates two statistic techniques : spatial bootstrap and bayesian update .",
    "generally , it can be stated that spatial bootstrap helps minimizing difficulty ( a ) and bayesian update helps minimizing difficulty ( b ) .      spatial bootstrap : :    in relation to the methodology suggested by @xcite , two modifications    were added regarding the way the conceptual models are randomized , or ,    in other words , their uncertainty assessment .",
    "we consider realities    with different structural models ( variograms ) which are compared , each    one of them , with a different set of scenarios ( see section [ sp ] ) .",
    "bayesian update : :    the presented method to calculate likelihood does not account for    global proportions , but for proportions according to its spatial    similitude .",
    "this decision faces one trade off . on the one hand , it is    harder to choose the best model , on the other hand , it tries to    improve chosen model reliability .",
    "integration : :    with the integration of spatial bootstrap and bayesian update , we    presented one way of choosing which model is the best , amongst    different conceptual models , according to its uncertainty .",
    "the best    conceptual model is not necessarily the one which reproduces the same    structure as the reality , it also depends on the discrepancy of the    initial hypothesis in relation to the reality .",
    "such hypothesis is then    corrected by the bayesian update , given the different scenarios    considered through spatial bootstrap .    during this work",
    ", several algorithms were developed to accomplish every steps described in the presented methodology , using a highly efficient scientific programming language ( fortran ) , except for the direct sequential simulation , where we used an implementation for the parallelized version @xcite .",
    "as a side result , we created a tool which allows one to apply the developed methodology in an easy and integrated manner .",
    "thereby , a computational application is now available , which will help on the research and development of this methodology by any student or professional .",
    "in the course of this work , some alternative or additional steps to the developed methodology were emerging , which have all the legitimacy to be developed and tested , however there was a time limitation . here",
    "are some suggestions for a future work .",
    "application to real case studies : :    it would be interesting to apply this methodology to a real case and    compare with other methods .",
    "its adaptation and application to other    fields , within the earth sciences , e.g. , other natural resources or    environmental impact studies , or even other areas of knowledge , would    certainly be an interesting challenge .",
    "drilling strategy : :    the tested location of wells was , in some way , solely random",
    ". wells    which are located in high pay zones should be tested , thus assessing    uncertainty when available data is biased .",
    "scenarios simulations : :    we just simulated one geological scenario for each pair    @xmath51 , within the same drilling strategy .",
    "although    this number can be enough for what was intended , running several    simulations would result in one more measure of uncertainty .",
    "integrate other data : :    seismic information could be incorporated in the spatial bootstrap    procedure ( e.g. , through cosimulation ) , contributing to the bias    reduction related to wells location as well the uncertainty associated    to this process @xcite .",
    "model selector function : :    the referred approach to select the best model ( section [ ss :    sensibilidade ] ) needs a longer time of research and development , and    it could prove to be an important tool in reservoir stochastic    modeling ."
