    "an indirect but potentially powerful method to determine the elemental abundances of extrasolar minor bodies and planets is to measure the photospheric compositions of stars they pollute .",
    "such studies in main - sequence stars are challenging because the host star s photosphere possesses intrinsic metals , making it difficult to determine the amount , if any , of contamination ( see gonzalez 2006 ) .",
    "in contrast , heavy elements rapidly settle out of the atmospheres of white dwarfs cooler than 20,000 k ( koester & wilken 2006 ) , so that photospheric metals have an external source .",
    "we hope to identify which metal - possessing cool white dwarfs have accreted circumstellar rather than interstellar material in order to use these white dwarf atmospheres to measure the bulk elemental composition of extrasolar minor planets .",
    "there are strong arguments that the approximately ten single white dwarfs known to have an infrared excess ( kilic et al .",

    "( 1 ) the near - infrared excess discovered around g29 - 38 ( zuckerman & becklin 1987 ) was shown to be produced by dust ( graham et al . 1990 ) that likely resulted from an orbitally - perturbed minor planet ( debes & sigurdsson 2002 ) that passed within the tidal - radius of the host star ( jura 2003 ) .",
    "for other white dwarfs , the infrared excess is usually well modeled with a geomerically flat dust disk that lies within the tidal - radius of the star ( jura et al .",
    "( 2 ) the infrared spectrum of g29 - 38 displays strong 10 @xmath0 m silicate emission with a spectral shape that resembles dust emission from the zodiacal light rather than interstellar silicates ( reach et al . 2005 ) .",
    "gd 362 , the second white dwarf discovered to have a near - infrared excess ( becklin et al .",
    "2005 , kilic et al . 2005 ) , also displays a 10 @xmath0 m silicate feature characterisitic of asteroidal rather than interstellar dust ( jura et al .",

    "( 4 ) the atmospheric composition of gd 362 is refractory - rich and volatile - poor ( zuckerman et al .",
    "2007 ) , reminiscent of material in the inner solar system and unlike the interstellar medium .",
    "while not as comprehensively studied as gd 362 , there are at least three other white dwarfs which are makedly deficient in carbon relative to iron as is characteristic of asteroids and very unlike the sun or interstellar matter ( jura 2006 ) .",

    "2007 ) , there are difficulties with this model .",
    "first , at least for helium - rich stars , the accretion of hydrogen relative to calcium must be suppressed by at least a factor of 100 ( dufour et al .",
    "none of the suggested mechanisms such as magnetic shielding that preferentially exclude hydrogen from the star have yet received any observational support ( friedrich , jordan & koester 2004 ) .",
    "furthermore , there is no correlation between metal contamination and the star s space motion as would be expected from bondi - hoyle accretion theory ( zuckerman et al .",
    "2003 , koester & wilken 2006 ) .",
    "finally , using a very simple model of grain inspiral because of poynting - robertson drag , jura et al .",
    "( 2007b ) showed that the predicted fluxes at 24 @xmath0 m for bondi - hoyle accretion can be more than 100 times greater than the observed upper limits . in view of these difficulties , the alternative of accretion of circumstellar matter merits consideration .",
    "gaensicke et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2007 ) have identified two metal - contaminated single white dwarfs with gaseous dust disks that are likely the result of tidal - disruption of a large parent - body such as an asteroid .",
    "it is possible that in many cases , the dust orbiting a white dwarf is destroyed and therefore stars without an infrared excess may still experience accretion from tidally - disrupted minor bodies . in this paper , we elaborate upon this possibility .",
    "in contrast to hydrogen - rich white dwarfs where the gravitational settling time of metals is typically less than 100 years ( see von hippel & thompson 2007 ) , in helium - rich white dwarfs cooler than 20,000 k , the gravitational settling time may be considerably longer than 10@xmath3 yr ( paquette et al .",
    "1986 , dupuis et al .",
    "although very uncertain , below , we suggest that the lifetime of a dusty disk around a white dwarf might be @xmath410@xmath3 yr . therefore , at least for the helium - rich white dwarfs , the absence of an infrared excess might simply be a situation where a single tidally - disrupted asteroid has been fully accreted and the disk has dissipated but the contamination still lingers in the star s atmosphere .    in @xmath5",
    "we present a qualitative overview of our proposed model where we suggest that contaminated white dwarfs without an infrared excess accrete from a gaseous disk created by the accumulation from many small asteroids .",
    "this contrasts with our model for the white dwarfs with an infrared excess which we expect to be the result of the destruction of a single large asteroid .",
    "in @xmath6 we argue that asteroids larger than 1 - 10 km in radius are likely to survive the star s evolution through the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase . in @xmath7 , we describe in somewhat more detail our model of white dwarf contamination by multiple tidal - disruptions of small asteroids . in @xmath8",
    "we discuss observational asssessment of this scenario . in @xmath9",
    "we discuss implications of this model and in @xmath10 we present our conclusions .",
    "very little is known about extrasolar asteroid belts .",
    "even the presence of warm dust at a few au from the star does not tightly constrain the parent body populations ( see wyatt et al . 2007 ) . here , assuming that many other main - sequence stars possess an asteroid belt similar to the solar system s , we present a single illustrative model to account for the white dwarf data .",
    "there are many unknown parameters ; our calculations are aimed to establish there is at least one plausible scenario where multiple small asteroids can explain the presence of metals in white dwarf photospheres . if detailed abundance studies of polluted white dwarfs without an infrared excess are shown to be consistent with this hypothesis , then a more comprehensive investigation would be warranted .    in our illustrative model ,",
    "we suggest that the total mass of the asteroid belt when the star becomes a white dwarf is 10@xmath11 g , somewhat larger than the solar system s asteroid belt current mass of 1.8 @xmath12 10@xmath13 g ( binzel , hanner & steel 2000 ) . we assume there is a steeply rising number of lower - mass asteroids , and we then compute that asteroids larger than @xmath41 - 10 km in radius plausibly survive the star s evolution through the asymptotic giant branch . although we do not compute detailed models , we propose that the orbits of these asteroids are occasionally perturbed on a time scale of @xmath41 gyr into orbits which lead them within the tidal radius of the white dwarf ( see debes & sigurdsson 2002 , duncan & lissauer 1998 ) where the asteroid is rapidly shredded into smaller rocks and dust debris .",
    "small asteroids are sufficiently common , that perhaps one is perturbed into an orbit where it is tidally - disrupted every 300 years .",
    "we argue that the accretion time on the white dwarf is long compared to this arrival time , so that white dwarfs with surviving asteroid belts inevitably possess a low - mass disk composed of disintegrated larger bodies .",
    "it is likely that newly perturbed asteroids arrive at a random nonzero inclination relative to the pre - existing disk . as the asteroid passes through the disk , solid material",
    "is rapidly sputtered into the gas - phase and a small asteroid is effectively vaporized .",
    "the matter gained by the disk from disrupted asteroids is lost by accretion into the atmosphere of the white dwarf , thus explaining the star s external pollution . in these systems , there is little dust and a negligible infrared excess .    more rarely , a large asteroid is perturbed into an orbit where it is tidally disrupted .",
    "if sufficiently large , the destroyed asteroid dominates over the pre - existing gaseous disk . in these systems , a dust ring is formed and survives for perhaps 10@xmath3 years ; during this phase there is an infrared excess .",
    "asteroids must survive the agb phase if they are to pollute the star as a white dwarf .",
    "rybicki & denis ( 2001 ) discuss three processes that can lead to terrestrial planet destruction during the agb phase .",
    "a planet can induce a tidal bulge in its host star which can then interact with the planet to drag it inwards .",
    "however , asteroids have such small masses , that this effect is not important .",
    "below , we consider two other routes for asteroid destruction .      asteroids may spiral into the host star under the action of gas drag as they orbit through the wind of the agb star .",
    "we assume that an asteroid is destroyed if it encounters its own mass in the wind .",
    "this destruction occurs because of hydrodynamic friction rather than sputtering which is negligible since the colliding gas atoms have kinetic energies of only a few ev ( see tielens et al .",
    "1994 ) . at distance @xmath14 from the star in a spherically symmetric wind of mass loss rate @xmath15 with outflow speed ,",
    "@xmath16 , the gas density , @xmath17 , is @xmath18 as long as gravitational focusing is negligible , the rate of encountering mass , @xmath19 , by the asteroid is : @xmath20 where the asteroid of radius @xmath21 has orbital speed @xmath22 . for this evaluation",
    ", we assume that the asteroid s radius and mass are constant during the agb phase . for circular motion : @xmath23    if the time scale for mass loss is slow compared to the asteroid s orbital period , then the specific angular momentum of the asteroid is approximately conserved and : @xmath24 for an initial distance , @xmath25 , from a star of initial mass , @xmath26 .",
    "as the star loses mass and @xmath27 diminishes , then the asteroid s orbit expands . combining equations ( 1)-(4 ) , then during the star s agb phase ,",
    "the total encountered mass , @xmath28 is : @xmath29 in arriving at the last expression in equation ( 5 ) , a simplified and slightly altered version of equation ( 3 ) of duncan & lissauer ( 1998 ) , we assume @xmath26 @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath31 is the final of the star ( see , for example , weidemann 2000 ) .    if @xmath32 is the density of the asteroid whose mass is @xmath33 , then equation ( 5 ) leads to the condition that the minimum radius of a surviving asteroid , @xmath34 , is : @xmath35    we only consider asteroids with initial distances from the host star greater than 2 au because interior to this region , there may be a quasi - static region around the agb star with a density much greater than given by equation ( 1 ) ( reid & menten 1997 ) . beyond 2au , we assume an outflow velocity of 2 km s@xmath36 ( keady , hall & ridgway 1988 ) , a speed that is appreciably smaller than the typical wind terminal speed of 15 km s@xmath36 ( zuckerman 1980 ) . we adopt @xmath32 = 2.1 g @xmath37 , as inferred for ceres ( michalak 2000 ) .",
    "we show in figure 1 the results for @xmath34 as a function of @xmath25 for initial stellar masses of 1.5 m@xmath38 , 3 m@xmath38 and 5 m@xmath38 .",
    "as can be seen from equation ( 6 ) , the value of @xmath34 diminishes rapidly as @xmath25 increases since less mass is encountered in the wind .",
    "also , @xmath34 increases with the intial mass of the star since the star ejects more mass for the asteroid to encounter . depending upon the initial distance from the host star and its mass",
    ", we find that asteroids larger than 1 - 10 km in radius are likely to survive the drag induced by the agb wind .",
    "subjected to the star s high agb luminosity , an asteroid might thermally sublimate , and we now estimate the minimum size asteroid that survives this process .",
    "if the star s high luminosity phase has duration , @xmath39 , then , the minimum size of a surviving asteroid is : @xmath40 @xmath41 is the rate at which an asteroid s radius shrinks because of sublimation : @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the mass production rate from the dust per unit area ( g @xmath44 s@xmath36 ) as a function of the asteroid temperature , @xmath45 . assuming pure olivine , then : @xmath46 where , converted to cgs units , @xmath47 = 1.5 @xmath12 10@xmath48 g @xmath44 s@xmath36 and @xmath49 = 65,300 k ( kimura et al .",
    "different materials may have different sublimation rates so our results are sensitive to the presumed asteroid composition .",
    "we adopt olivine as this appears to be the most likely carrier of the 10 @xmath0 m silicate emission seen in g29 - 38 ( reach et al .",
    "2005 ) and gd 362 ( jura et al .",
    "2007a ) as well as being common in the solar system .",
    "assuming that the asteroids have a negligible albedo , we write that : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the luminosity of the star and @xmath52 is the stephan - boltzmann constant . while on the agb",
    ", we assume the star has a luminosity near 10@xmath53 l@xmath38 or larger for @xmath39 = 2 @xmath12 10@xmath3 yr ( jura & kleinmann 1992 ) .",
    "using equation ( 8)-(10 ) , we show in figure 2 the minimum size asteroid from equation ( 7 ) for stellar luminosities of 1 @xmath12 10@xmath53 l@xmath38 and 2 @xmath12 10@xmath53 l@xmath38 as a function of the asteroid s distance from the star .",
    "we neglect the orbital drift of the asteroid discussed above . because the thermal sublimation rate is temperature sensitive , asteroid survival decreases rapidly as the star s luminosity increases or for asteroids that orbit relatively close to the star .",
    "we see from figure 2 that depending upon the luminosity of the star , asteroids with radii between 1 and 10 km are likely to survive if they orbit beyond 3 or 4 au .",
    "eventually , those asteroids that survive a star s agb evolution , may have their orbits perturbed so that they come within the tidal radius of the white dwarf ( duncan & lissauer 1998 , debes & sigurdsson 2002 ) .",
    "when this occurs , the asteroid is shredded into dust .",
    "if the asteroid is relatively small and if there is a pre - existing disk from destruction of previous asteroids , then the shredded debris of the new asteroid is destroyed by sputtering in the pre - existing disk , and the circumstellar matter is largely gaseous . if , instead , the asteroid is more massive than the pre - existing disk , there is not enough gas to sputter the debris from the asteroid , and a disk with a large amount of dust at the inclination angle of the large asteroid is created .",
    "this more massive disk subsumes the low - mass pre - existing gaseous disk .",
    "eventually , however , this large disk is accreted onto the star and the system relaxes to its steady state configuration of a largely gaseous disk .    denote the total asteroid belt total mass as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 denotes the cooling time of the white dwarf .",
    "let @xmath56 be the mean lifetime of an asteroid before it is perturbed into the tidal radius of the star .",
    "assuming that all of the shredded asteroid ultimately is accreted , then the average metal - accretion rate , @xmath57 , is : @xmath58    if the circumstellar gaseous disk around a white dwarf has a lifetime , @xmath59 , then the mass of a typical disk , @xmath60 , is : @xmath61 we propose that if an asteroid has a mass larger than @xmath60 , then a single event dominates the circumstellar environment , and the star exhibits an infrared excess . if , however , an asteroid arrives with a mass lower than @xmath60 , then this newly - shredded asteroid s dust debris is rapidly vaporized and the disk remains gaseous .",
    "we picture that all polluted white dwarfs possess in a steady state a gaseous disk , and , occasionally , a massive dusty disk .",
    "it is likely that a white dwarf takes relatively little time to enter its  normal \" steady state with a gaseous disk .",
    "the first tidally - disrupted asteroid is shredded into dust which can persist for a long time since there is not likely to be much viscosity in the dust particles .",
    "the second tidally - disrupted asteroid also is shredded into dust , but its orbital inclination is likely to be different from that of the first asteroid .",
    "consequently , there will be grain - grain collisions approaching  1000 km s@xmath36 within the tidal radius .",
    "these collisions are very destructive and large amounts of gas will be released .",
    "eventually , as described below , the disk will evolve into a largely gaseous system .      to progress further",
    ", we now estimate the lifetime of a white dwarf s circumstellar disk which we presume is controlled by viscous dissipation .",
    "we could extrapolate from cataclysmic variables to single white dwarfs .",
    "however , disks derive from destroyed asteroids probably have little hydrogen , and their compositions are very different from that of the disks in cataclysmic variables . for a gaseous circumstellar disk , the time for viscous dissipation is ( king , pringle & livio 2007 ) @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the usual dimensionless parameter , and",

    "( 22 ) , the number of such asteroids , @xmath119 , is : @xmath120 the total rate at which these asteroids are perturbed into orbits where they are tidally - destroyed is @xmath121 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath96 is the duration of a dust disk , the fraction of time , @xmath122 , that the white dwarf exhibits an infrared excess is : @xmath123 using equations from above , this expression becomes : @xmath124 evaluation of expression ( 29 ) is insensitive to the exact values of @xmath107 and @xmath106 . from our estimates given above , we find that @xmath122 = 0.062 @xmath125 . in @xmath126 , we argued that @xmath96 @xmath4 3 @xmath127 .",
    "although extremely uncertain , the prediction from equation ( 29 ) is therefore that @xmath122 @xmath4 0.19 , consistent with the observational constraint determined by kilic & redfield ( 2007 ) that at least 14% of externally - polluted hydrogen - rich white - dwarfs possess an infrared excess .",
    "one motivation for studying the composition of contaminated white dwarfs is that it enables the measurement of the bulk elemental composition of extrasolar minor planets .",
    "for example , the photosphere of the white dwarf gd 362 was found to be markedly deficient in volatiles such as carbon and sodium relative to refractories such as calcium and iron ( zuckerman et al .",
    "2007 ) , a pattern reminiscent of the inner solar system where the earth and asteroids also are very volatile deficient .",
    "wolff et al . ( 2002 ) reported relative abundances of iron , magnesium , silicon , calcium and carbon in 10 helium - rich white dwarf .",
    "although in many cases the uncertainties are very large , three of these stars exhibit a carbon abundance less than that of iron , and therefore a value of @xmath77(c)/@xmath77(fe ) that is at least a factor of 10 smaller than solar .",
    "these three stars have a composition similar to that of the earth or chondrites ; they do not appear to have accreted interstellar matter ( jura 2006 ) .",
    "one of these three stars , gd 40 , also displays an infrared excess ( jura et al .",
    "2007b ) , consistent with the hypothesis that it is accreting chondritic material .",
    "however , the other two stars do not display an infrared excess ( farihi et al .",
    "2008b ) which , however , as discussed below , does not preclude the asteroid accretion scenario .",
    "desharnais et al .",
    "( 2008 ) report fuse data for 5 helium - rich white dwarfs . of these 5 stars ,",
    "gd 378 has @xmath77(c)/@xmath77(fe ) = 2.5 , within the errors not grossly different from the solar value of 8.3 ( lodders 2003 ) .",
    "there are mostly only upper limits to the abundances for gd 233 , a second star in this sample .",
    "however , g270 - 124 , gd 61 and gd 408 all have values of @xmath77(c)/@xmath77(fe ) less than 0.3",
    ". these three stars are therefore candidates for having accreted chondritic material .",
    "g270 - 124 does not display an infrared excess shortward of 8 @xmath0 m ( mullally et al . 2007 ) .",
    "as far as we know , gd 61 has not observed for an infrared excess .",
    "there is a hint of an excess at 7.9 @xmath0 m for gd 408 ( mullally et al .",
    "2007 ) , but the signal to noise was not good enough for a definitive conclusion .",
    "not all contaminated white dwarfs appear to have accreted chondritic material .",
    "g238 - 44 has been found to display @xmath77(c)/@xmath77(fe ) near 2.5 ( dupuis et al . 2007 ) ; this star does not display any infrared excess ( mullally et al .",
    "2007 ) . as with gd 378",
    ", the source of the external matter is unknown .",
    "there are at least two possible explanations for the absence of a near infrared excess around externally - polluted helium - rich white dwarfs .",
    "first , as discussed above , the circumstellar disk could be largely gaseous .",
    "second , the disk may have dissipated before the contaminants have settled out of the star s atmosphere .",
    "the settling time of heavy metals in the atmospheres of these stars with effective temperatures between 15,000 k and 21,000 k ranges from @xmath43 @xmath12 10@xmath53 yr to @xmath45 @xmath12 10@xmath3 yr ( dupuis et al .",
    "1993 ) , comparable to or longer than our very rough estimate of the duration of a dust disk of 1.5 @xmath12 10@xmath3 yr .",
    "above , we have adopted the view that a disk is either essentially all dust or all gas .",
    "however , it is possible that some dust survives in disks that are bombarded by numerous small asteroids .",
    "consider the case where the interior of the disk is gaseous yet the outer portion remains dusty , and thus the disk distribution may have an especially large central hole .",
    "all but one of the ten white dwarfs currently known to have an infrared excess has dust as warm as 1000 k ( see jura et al .",
    "this innermost temperature may be determined by the location where grain sublimation becomes rapid .",
    "however , g166 - 58 ( also known as lhs 3007 or wd 1456 + 298 ) , a metal polluted white dwarf with a metal accretion rate of 3 @xmath12 10@xmath69 g s@xmath36 ( koester & wilken 2006 ) , was found by farihi et al . ( 2008a ) to have an excess at 5.7 @xmath0 m and 7.9 @xmath0 m , but not at shorter wavelengths .",
    "following jura et al .",
    "( 2007b ) , we compute a model with a flat disk to reproduce the data .",
    "we adopt a stellar temperature of 7390 k and a ratio of the star s radius ( 9.1 @xmath12 10@xmath95 cm ) to the star s distance from the sun ( @xmath7030 pc ) , @xmath90 , of 1.0 @xmath12 10@xmath128 .",
    "we fit the infrared data with an inner disk temperature of 400 k ( corresponding to a physical distance from the star of 30 @xmath89 , jura [ 2003 ] ) , an outer disk temperature of 300 k ( corresponding to a physical distance from the star of 43 @xmath89 ) , and @xmath129 = 0.4 .",
    "this model disk lies well within the tidal zone which extends to @xmath4 100 @xmath89 ( davidsson 1999 ) .",
    "the comparison between observations and the model is shown in figure 4 ; the fit is good enough that this model is a serious contender for explaining the data .",
    "thus , this system may be in an intermediate phase of its disk evolution where the dust disk has an usually large hole because bombardment destroyed dust in the inner disk .",
    "gaensicke et al . ( 2006 , 2007 ) report emission lines from two disks ; most polluted white dwarfs do not display emission lines even though we postulate the presence of a circumstellar reservoir from which they accrete .",
    "we suggest that the systems with detected emission are unusual because the gas has an unusually high excitation temperature , @xmath130 .",
    "if the star has effective temperature , @xmath131 , and subtends solid angle , @xmath132 , while the disk subtends solid angle , @xmath133 , then a line is seen in emission if : @xmath134 for sdss 1228 + 1040 , the analysis of gaensicke et al .",
    "( 2006 ) yields @xmath135 = 1.2 @xmath12 10@xmath53 . since @xmath131 = 22020 k ,",
    "then for the calcium lines near 8500  , the above criterion requires @xmath130 @xmath136 1800 k. this temperature is much greater than expected for a passively heated disk material lying at 100 stellar radii ( see jura 2003 ) , and some additional heating of the gas must be occuring .",
    "gaensicke et al .",
    "( 2006 ) show that the calcium lines are asymmetric and they explain this as the consequence of our viewing an eccentric disk . because the orbits should circularize by mutual collisiions , it is plausible that the eccentricity is being driven by some external unseen planet .",
    "if so , this material also would be heated .",
    "other disks may not be subjected to such extreme heating , and their circumstellar gas would be too cool to be detected .",
    "there are a number of similarities between the asteroid belt in the solar system and the proposed asteroid belts around white dwarfs .",
    "we invoke asteroid belt masses of 10@xmath11 g at the time the star enters its white dwarf phase , this mass is about a factor of 6 larger than the mass of the asteroid belt in the solar system .",
    "however , if stars form with a salpeter mass function , @xmath99 , that varies as @xmath137 and if the lowest mass star that currently is dying has a mass of 0.9 m@xmath38 , then the median main - sequence mass of a dying star is @xmath41.5 m@xmath38 .",
    "there may be a linear scaling between the mass of a star s asteroid belt and its main - sequence mass .",
    "furthermore , 1.5 m@xmath38 stars spend only @xmath43 gyr on the main - sequence before becoming white dwarfs , significantly less than the current age of the solar system of 4.6 gyr .",
    "thus , when a 1.5 m@xmath38 star becomes a white dwarf , a simple linear extrapolation from the solar system suggests that it would possess 4 @xmath12 10@xmath13 g , and thus approximately resemble the solar system .    a minimum mass of an extrasolar asteroid can be estimated from the mass of contaminants in the atmosphere of a contaminated helium - rich white dwarf . since calculations for",
    "the mass in the outer mixing zone differ by as much as a factor of 10 ( dupuis et al .",
    "1993 , macdonald et al . 1998 ) , these estimates are uncertain . at the moment ,",
    "the most polluted known he - rich white dwarf is hs 2253 + 8023 ( wolff et al .",
    "2002 ) , and the inferred mass of its accreted asteroid is @xmath410@xmath13 g ( jura 2006 ) , comparable to the mass of ceres .",
    "the relative numbers of polluted white dwarfs with and without an infrared excess is explained by a mass distribution of extrasolar asteroids that varies as @xmath102 , approximately what is observed in the solar system .",
    "thus extrasolar asteroid belts may possess a size distribution similar to that of asteroids in the solar system .",
    "remarkably , in marked contrast to the sun , carbon appears to be less abundant by number than iron or silicon in at least a few extrasolar asteroids .",
    "similarly , as measured from chondrites ( lodders 2003 ) , asteroids in the solar system have a similarly low carbon to iron abundance ratio . as argued previously ( jura 2006 ) , determinations of the abundances in the atmospheres of white dwarfs can serve both to evaluate the model of interstellar accretion and , at least in some cases , to measure the composition of extrasolar asteroids .",
    "we suggest that the contamination of many externally - polluted white dwarfs without an infrared excess results from tidal - disruptions of numerous small asteroids . this scenario is consistent with the hypothesis that the masses , size distributions and compositions of extrasolar asteroids are similar to those of the solar system s asteroids .",
