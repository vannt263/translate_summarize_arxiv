    "while finite non - commutative operator systems lie at the foundation of quantum measurement , they are also tools for understanding geometric iterations as used in the theory of iterated function systems ( ifss ) and in wavelet analysis .",

    "referring back to our ifs application , the extreme case of the operator relations turn out to correspond to the limiting case of non - overlap . using this operator theory , in this paper",
    "we explore the fractal measures associated with the inherent self similarity affine fractals , a subject involving both iterated function systems ( ifss ) , and an aspect of quantum communication .    in the paper",
    "we aim to draw up connections between the following three areas , quantum channels , fractal measures , and wavelets .",
    "our understanding of quantum measurement follows the tradition of kraus @xcite : by a quantum measurement of a system refers to a system in some state and we want to determine whether it has some property @xmath10 , where @xmath10 should be thought of as an element in a logic lattice of quantum yes - no questions .",
    "measurement means submitting the system to some procedure to determine whether the state satisfies the property .",
    "the reference to system state in turn must be given an operational meaning by reference to a statistical ensemble of systems .",
    "each measurement yields some definite value 0 or 1 .",
    "the connections to fractal measures and wavelets ( see e.g. , @xcite ) derive from a common mathematical core based in turn on hierarchical patterns common to them .",
    "wavelets are computational bases in hilbert space which make use of the scaling law , with each step in the scaling creating a refinement in a resolution of data , and taking advantage of similarity from one level of resolution to the next",
    ". hence we arrive at the characteristic feature of fractals , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "mathematically , an identification of quantum channels may be made with a finite system of operators ( @xmath9 ) which together form a column isomety ; see ( 1 ) below . in the physics literature , they are known as kraus - systems , and mathematically they generalize the so called cuntz relations ; see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the systems ( @xmath9 ) which are the focus of our paper in turn determine completely positive mappings @xmath11 as recalled below . in this paper we show that repeated application of operator system yields the kind of refinement that underlies both wavelets and fractals , and moreover that the statistical properties from quantum channels is of significance in decomposition problems from wavelets . and with the scaling from wavelet theory now corresponding to @xmath11 .",
    "both the quantum mechanical measurement problem and ifss have as starting point a finite set of operations : in the case of ifss they are geometric , and in the quantum case , they involve channels of hilbert spaces and associated operator systems .",
