    "consequently , this direct connection between @xmath18 and @xmath16 gives rise to phenomenological predictions for processes which depend on @xmath18 because @xmath20 has been severely restricted by neutrino oscillation measurements  @xcite .",
    "a distinctive signal of the htm would be the observation of a `` doubly charged higgs boson '' ( @xmath2 , with two units of electric charge ) , whose mass ( @xmath21 ) may be of the order of the electroweak scale .",

    "the resulting higgs spectrum contains a massless triplet scalar ( majoron , @xmath92 ) and another light scalar ( @xmath9 ) , with the coupling @xmath93 being unsuppressed .",
    "pair production via @xmath94 would give a large contribution to the invisible width of the @xmath95 , and thus this model was excluded at the cern large electron positron collider  ( lep ) .",
    "the inclusion of the term @xmath96 )  @xcite explicitly breaks lepton number @xmath97 when @xmath14 is assigned @xmath98 .",
    "then , the majoron is eliminated from the model , and a non - zero @xmath19 can be obtained even for @xmath99 .",

    "however , in this scenario the triplet scalars would be too heavy to be observed at the lhc . in recent years",

    "( [ tripletvev ] ) leads to @xmath107 , and this is the scenario we will focus on .",
    "the case of @xmath108 is phenomenologically attractive ( and it is assumed in the ongoing searches at the lhc ) because the brs of the triplet scalars to leptonic final states ( e.g.  @xmath12 ) would be @xmath109 .",
    "due to the condition @xmath107 for light triplet scalars , @xmath105 must also be small ( compared to the electroweak scale ) for the scenario of @xmath108 . since @xmath105 is the only source of explicit lepton number violation in the htm , its numerical value would be naturally small according to the t  hooft criteria .",

    "however , we note that for @xmath121 the decay channel of @xmath2 to leptonic final states would be negligible , and thus the production mechanisms which depend on @xmath19 can be neglected in searches for @xmath12 . at the 1-loop level",

    "the mechanisms @xmath172 and @xmath173 , although not being suppressed by a small coupling , would give rise to a signature of @xmath174 and missing energy , which suffers from large backgrounds . therefore the neutral scalars which originate from @xmath175 , with the vev of the cp - even neutral field providing the mass for the neutrinos , would ( most likely ) be unobservable at the lhc for @xmath153 .    at an @xmath176 collider we note that it would be possible to observe the process @xmath177 provided that a photon is radiated from the lepton beams . using lep data for `` a photon plus missing energy '' events ,",

    "<S> the neutral triplet scalars  ( @xmath0 ) in the higgs triplet model  ( htm ) are difficult to detect at the lhc for the case of mass degeneracy with the singly charged  ( @xmath1 ) and doubly charged  ( @xmath2 ) scalars </S>",

    "<S> such a cascade process would lead to production of @xmath7 accompanied by several virtual @xmath8 bosons , and would provide a way of observing @xmath9 and @xmath10 with a signature which is different from that of the conventional production process for doubly charged scalars , @xmath11 . assuming the decay @xmath12 , we quantify the magnitude of the five - lepton and six - lepton signals in these channels , which have essentially negligible backgrounds at the lhc . </S>"
