    "the subset of @xmath7 consisting of the @xmath8 s for which @xmath9 is @xmath10-regular coincides with kashiwara s lower global basis ( or lusztig s canonical basis ) of the irreducible sub - representation of @xmath2 generated by the highest weight vector @xmath11 .    the main motivation for introducing the bases @xmath7 and @xmath12 was their conjectural relation with the decomposition matrices of the @xmath13-schur algebras @xmath14 defined by dipper and james @xcite in connection with the modular representation theory of the finite groups @xmath15 in non - describing characteristic .",
    "conjecture 5.2 of @xcite was proved by varagnolo and vasserot @xcite , who established that the coefficients of the expansion of @xmath16 on the basis @xmath17 are equal to the kazhdan - lusztig polynomials appearing in lusztig s character formula for @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a complex primitive @xmath10th root of 1 .",

    "assume that @xmath30 , and let @xmath31 denote the radical series of @xmath27 . in @xcite",
    "the graded composition multiplicities @xmath32 \\ , v^i\\ ] ] of all @xmath27 in @xmath25 were computed explicitely in terms of the littlewood - richardson coefficients , using a morita equivalence between @xmath25 and the principal block of @xmath33 established in @xcite .",
    "this morita equivalence is similar to a morita equivalence for blocks of symmetric groups conjectured long ago by rouquier ( see @xcite ) and recently proved by chuang and kessar @xcite .",
    "it was also conjectured in @xcite that @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the @xmath36-decomposition number of @xcite , that is , the coefficient of @xmath37 in the expansion of @xmath38 .",
    "the main result of this paper is a proof of this conjecture .",
    "simultaneously , we also determine a similar expression for the coefficient @xmath39 of @xmath40 in the expansion of  @xmath16 . as a consequence",
    "we obtain a closed and combinatorial expression for two families of parabolic affine kazhdan - lusztig polynomials .",
    "it is remarkable that in fact all these polynomials are just monomials .",
    "another consequence is that we obtain a representation - theoretical interpretation of these particular @xmath36-decomposition numbers : the exponent of @xmath36 in @xmath35 indicates to which layer of the radical filtration of @xmath27 the copies of the simple module @xmath41 belong .    in terms of the fock space",
    ", the block @xmath25 corresponds to a distinguished weight space .",
    "more precisely , there is a natural bijection between the set of @xmath10-core partitions and the set of extremal weights @xmath42 of @xmath2 . here",

    "let @xmath47 be the extremal weight corresponding to @xmath28 in this bijection .",
    "then our results give some closed formulas in terms of the littlewood - richardson coefficients for the @xmath17-expansions of all the @xmath38 s and @xmath16 s of weight @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the imaginary root .",
    "let @xmath50 denote the set of weights of @xmath2 .",

    "let @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) denote the transition matrix from @xmath17 to @xmath7 ( from @xmath17 to @xmath12 ) in the weight space @xmath58 .",
    "having computed the matrices @xmath59 and @xmath60 , it is easy to determine @xmath56 and @xmath57 for many other weights @xmath61 . indeed , suppose that @xmath55 and @xmath62 is a simple root of @xmath46 such that @xmath63 .",
    "let @xmath64 be the simple reflection of @xmath53 associated with @xmath62 . then @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "it follows that , for each @xmath29 , the orbit @xmath67 can be splitted into a finite number of classes on which the matrices @xmath56 and @xmath57 remain constant .",
    "the class of @xmath68 for which we have found closed formulas is always infinite , hence for each @xmath29 our computations give the transition matrices for an infinite number of weights of @xmath67 .",
    "moreover , in the case of @xmath69 this class is the only infinite one and therefore our formulas calculate in this case the matrices for all but a finite number of weights in each @xmath67 .",
    "these facts , which are easily deduced from the theory of crystal bases , are the fock space counterpart of scopes results @xcite about morita equivalence for blocks of the symmetric groups , and of the analogues of these results for blocks of hecke algebras and unipotent blocks of @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sect2 ]",

    "the standard basis of @xmath71 is given by the products of schur functions @xmath74 .",
    "we introduce two new bases @xmath75 and @xmath76 which are canonical with respect to a certain bar - involution sending @xmath36 to @xmath77 and two crystal lattices @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and we calculate their expansions on the standard basis in terms of the littlewood - richardson coefficients .",
    "heuristically , we regard @xmath71 ( or rather its specialization @xmath80 at @xmath81 ) as the carrier space of the `` canonical commutation relations '' representation of the homogeneous heisenberg subalgebra of  @xmath82 .",
    "in fact , the sum of the homogeneous components of @xmath80 of degree less than @xmath20 can be identified to the sum of the complexified grothendieck groups @xmath83 where @xmath7 means the principal block . in this identification",
    "the vectors @xmath84 are mapped to the classes of the unipotent ordinary irreducible modules , and the vectors @xmath85 to the classes of the simple modules . in section  [ sect6 ]",
    "we state our main result ( theorem  [ th1 ] ) , namely that the canonical bases of certain weight spaces of @xmath2 coincide with the canonical bases of the corresponding homogeneous components of @xmath71 under a natural vector space isomorphism . at @xmath81",
    "this vector space isomorphism is essentially the natural intertwining operator between the principal and the homogeneous realization of the basic representation of @xmath46 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this is the counterpart in this setting of the morita equivalence of @xcite , and it gives immediately the above - mentioned formulas for @xmath35 and @xmath86 when @xmath9 and @xmath87 have @xmath10-core @xmath28 and @xmath10-weight @xmath88 ( corollary  [ formule ] ) .",
    "section  [ sect7 ] is devoted to the proof of theorem  [ th1 ] .",
