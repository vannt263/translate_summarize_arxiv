    "<S> research has proposed making thermal equivalents of functional electronic components , such as thermal transistors , diodes , and rectifiers .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite one application where controlling heat flow is essential is in thermoelectric devices ,  @xcite in which a temperature gradient is used to generate an electric current or voltage ( power conversion ) , or , conversely , an electric current is used to generate a temperature gradient ( refrigeration ) .    </S>",
    "<S> a good thermoelectric material must have a large seebeck coefficient , but also a reasonably good electric conductance combined with a poor heat conductance .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in general , both electrons and phonons contribute to the heat conductance . in bulk materials the conductance and the electron contribution to the heat conductance are related by wiedemann - franz law ,  @xcite limiting the thermoelectric performance . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , efforts have mainly focused on reducing the phonon contribution to the heat conductance , while trying to maintain electric conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> one way of phrasing it is to say that a good thermoelectric material should be an electron crystal , but a phonon glass .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite many recent theoretical works have investigated phonon transport in nanostructures  @xcite and experimental studies have shown reduced phonon conductance compared to bulk materials .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    it has also been shown that the electronic properties can be much more suited for thermoelectrics in nanoscale systems ,  @xcite where the wiedemann - franz law breaks down due to quantum confinement effects and strong electron - electron interactions .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite a promising candidate is molecular junctions ,  @xcite where sharp resonances originating from molecular orbitals  @xcite or interference effects  @xcite could result in a large thermoelectric effect .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it has also been argued that molecular junctions should have a very small phonon contribution to the heat conductance because , in small molecules , the quantized molecular vibrational modes have frequencies above the debye frequency of the electrodes , preventing phonon transport from the hot to the cold electrode via the molecule . </S>",
    "<S> however , this argument does not take into account the vibrational modes that are associated with center of mass motion of the entire molecule .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite since the mass of the entire molecule is very large compared with that of individual atoms , these modes have a low frequency , well inside the band of acoustic phonons in the electrodes , and might be detrimental for the thermoelectric performance .        in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we propose a solution to this problem by suggesting a simple mechanism to reduce the phonon conductance arising from the center of mass motion of a molecule in a transport junction . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is to have a molecular system that is divided into two sub units , where each sub unit binds strongly to one electrode , but where the two sub units are only weakly coupled to each other . in chemical terms </S>",
    "<S> , we break the bond between two parts of the molecule and consider two molecules that can only couple through - space . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the phonon conductance can be significantly reduced compared with the case of a single molecular unit in the junction . </S>",
    "<S> however , we also show that there is a regime where the heat current is enhanced due to the larger number of center - of - mass modes . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest and , using density functional theory ( dft ) , investigate concrete realizations of this proposal where the sub units are made by @xmath0-stacked aromatic rings , connected via @xmath0-@xmath0 electronic coupling , which provides a rather soft mechanical bridge while maintaining high electronic conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0-@xmath0 stacking is efficiently used by nature to achieve directed long - range electron transport , such as in dna base pairs  @xcite and amino acid residues . </S>",
    "<S> break - junction experiments have found that the intermolecular @xmath0-@xmath0 stacking interaction can lead to molecular junctions with significant conductance .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite thus , @xmath0-stacked systems could act as electric conductors , while the phonon conductance is tuned in order to meet the device requirements . </S>",
    "<S> we note that several recent experiments have investigated phonon transport in molecular monolayers .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    to model the systems we have in mind , we consider two masses @xmath1 and @xmath2 coupled by the spring @xmath3 to each other and by springs @xmath4 to the leads as shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> when the spring constant between the masses is weak , the phonon conductance is reduced compared with the situation with the single mass @xmath5 in the junction . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the vibrational degrees of freedom in a molecule and the coupling to the leads using the harmonic approximation and it is assumed that the molecule couples to a particular lead only at a single point @xmath6 , with @xmath7 . in such a model , we need to specify the spring constants @xmath8 in all three directions @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the leads are modeled as a continuum governed by the equations of motion for an elastic medium  @xcite described by the displacement vector @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the elastic description is reasonable because we are interested in the low energy behavior of the system , when phonons in the leads are long wavelength ( acoustic ) and have linear dispersion , and because the vibrational modes of the molecule contributing to the phonon conductance through the junction at room temperature have frequencies @xmath11 , the debye frequency of the leads .    </S>",

    "<S> @xmath38 the conductance overshoots the value of conductance when there is a single mass in the junction . </S>",

    "<S> we see that for the stacking combinations @xmath51 ( @xmath65 ) and @xmath52 ( @xmath66 ) , because of the small middle spring constant , the conductance is significantly reduced in the @xmath44 and @xmath34 directions compared with the case of a single mass in the junction . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) , @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) the conductance is larger than in the single mass case .    </S>",
    "<S> these results can be understood by considering the chemical structure of the molecules . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0-@xmath0 stacking results in appreciable mechanical coupling in the @xmath43 direction , holding the system together . </S>",
    "<S> however , for any pair of carbon atoms there is relatively weak interaction in the @xmath44 and @xmath34 directions . </S>",
    "<S> the larger coupling pushes the @xmath43 transport above the asymptotic limit in all these cases .    </S>",
    "<S> for the stackings @xmath51 and @xmath52 the coupling in the @xmath44 and @xmath34 directions is relatively low and the overall phonon conductance remains well below the one molecule limit . </S>",
    "<S> note that the largest reduction is for stacking @xmath52 , which has asymmetric masses . </S>",
    "<S> extending the @xmath0-system , in the case of @xmath67 , or adding hydrogen bonds across the stack , in the case of @xmath71 , results in increased coupling in the @xmath44 and @xmath34 directions , allowing the system as a whole to exhibit increased conductance . </S>",

    "<S> the red dashed - dotted line shows the behavior of @xmath75 when there is no phonon conductance , @xmath77 . ]    to describe the thermoelectric efficiency of @xmath0-stacked molecules in the junction , we calculate the dimensionless figure of merit @xmath72 , which is given by  @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the seebeck coefficient , @xmath80 is the electronic conductance , and @xmath81 is the electron contribution to the thermal conductance </S>",
    "<S> . we neglect inelastic scattering in our calculations and can therefore express the quantities @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 through the electron transmission @xmath74 using landauer - type expressions as described in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> the resulting @xmath72 at @xmath20 for the stacking @xmath52 , which had the largest reduction in phonon conductance , is depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]a . </S>",
    "<S> we see a slight increase in @xmath72 at some values of @xmath73 , but the overall effect is rather small even though the phonon conductance is reduced . </S>",
    "<S> this clearly indicates that the main contribution to the thermal transport comes from electrons ( see sm for the same calculations on the other three systems ) .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we also see that the values of @xmath72 for the examined molecules are not large , which is , however , mainly due to the electronic properties . from this study , we have a clear idea of how we can tune the phonon contribution to the thermal conductance </S>",
    "<S> . however , it remains an interesting challenge for future studies to find @xmath0-stacked molecular compounds with electronic properties which are more favorable for thermoelectric devices .    </S>",
    "<S> one possibility of increasing @xmath72 is to reduce the electronic coupling to the leads , which can be done without significantly altering the mechanical coupling by , for example , changing the binding group from a thiol ( chemisorbed ) to some physisorbed system . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown  @xcite that in the limit of a small electronic coupling , @xmath72 becomes infinite if the molecular resonances can be correctly positioned relative to the lead fermi level _ and if @xmath50 is neglected_. therefore , the efficiency is limited only by the phonon heat current and our mechanism can lead to a significant improvement . to illustrate this </S>",
    "<S> , we show in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]b the maximal @xmath72 value as a function of the coupling strength , @xmath82 $ ] , when the electron transmission has the form of a spinful resonant level , i.e. @xmath83 $ ] , where @xmath84 is the position of the level and @xmath76 denotes the coupling strength to the leads . </S>",
    "<S> we note that including coulomb interactions in the calculations would have a rather small effect on the result , as long as the associated energy scale is much smaller or larger than @xmath85 and @xmath76 .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    in conclusion , we have proposed a simple mechanism to control the heat transport which occurs due to center of mass modes in molecular junctions . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is based on vibrationally decoupling the left lead from the right lead . as an example we examined @xmath0-stacked molecules , showing that the proposed mechanism can indeed significantly reduce the phonon conductance , but also increase it depending on the specific molecules and stackings used . for the molecules investigated here </S>",
    "<S> , we found a maximal decrease by 35% and a maximal increase by 59% , but the basic mechanism is general and it is an interesting challenge for future first principle calculations and experiments to search for molecular compounds where the phonon heat conductance is reduced or increased even further , preferably in combination with electronic properties which are favorable for applications in , for example , thermoelectric devices .    </S>",
    "<S> while we have focused our attention on the thermoelectric response of these systems , one can envisage situations where maximising the phononic heat current is also desirable , for example to maintain thermal equilibrium across a device , allow heat to dissipate more efficiently , etc . in these instances , using @xmath0-stacked systems to increase the heat current could be very useful . the increased heat current we observe is trivial to understand when we consider that we are increasing the number of center - of - mass modes ; however , these systems present an interesting challenge to our intuition for heat transport . </S>",
    "<S> we have the clear , but somewhat paradoxical , result that we should break chemical bonds within a molecule in order to maximise the phononic heat transport in a molecular junction .    </S>",
