    "the most distant absorption - line system with observable ly-@xmath4 and ly-@xmath3 lines is the lyman limit system discovered by tytler et al .",
    "( 1996 , hereafter tfb ) at @xmath2 toward the quasar q  1937 - 1009 ( @xmath14 ) . in tfb , high resolution ( fwhm = 9 km s@xmath15 ) and high signal - to - noise ( s / n @xmath16 per pixel at the position of the ly-@xmath4 line ) keck spectra of q  1937 - 1009 revealed hydrogen absorption throughout the entire lyman series as well as a few metal absorption lines with asymmetric profiles . their first measurements of d / h based on a two - component microturbulent model ( voigt profile deconvolution analysis ) gave a low value of d / h = @xmath17 ( @xmath18 statistical and systematic errors ) .",
    "this result caused a lively discussion since the low d / h value would imply a high universal density of baryons @xmath19 ( tfb ) , where @xmath20 is the fraction of the critical density in form of baryons and @xmath21 is the hubble parameter scaled to 100 km  s@xmath15  mpc@xmath15 .",
    "note that the total sbbn baryon density compatible with the abundances of d and @xmath22he observed in the solar system and the interstellar medium , has been estimated to be @xmath23 ( hata et al .",
    "1996 ) , which is slightly larger than earlier bbn estimates @xmath24 ( walker et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "the lack of uniqueness in the voigt deconvolution procedure was employed by wampler ( 1996 ) to show that other microturbulent models could give d / h ratios that are about 3 times higher than the tfb s value and still are compatible with their fit .",
    "wampler also suggested that the total hydrogen column density may not be well determined by tfb because of either incorrect sky subtraction or improper modeling the ly-@xmath4 forest structure above and below the lyman continuum break .",
    "the latter is problematical for distant qsos exhibiting a high density ly-@xmath4 forest , and different methods of analysis have yielded by now different values for n ( )  : @xmath25 @xmath7 by songaila et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ; @xmath26 @xmath7 by burles & tytler ( 1997 ) .",
    "a value of n ( ) @xmath27 @xmath7 which `` produces a smooth forest opacity above and below the break '' was recently presented by songaila ( 1998 ) .",
    "using new constraints on n()@xmath28 , bt re - considered the d / h measurements from the @xmath2 system . in this new approach ,",
    "the metal absorption lines are not used to constrain d / h .",
    "the absorbers are separated into two groups  with low and high column densities [ n ( ) @xmath29 @xmath7 and n ( ) @xmath30 @xmath7 , respectively ] .",
    "the first group does not show and was utilized to fit the ly-@xmath4 forest features in the vicinity of the lyman series lines from the @xmath2 system .",
    "the second ( main ) group of lines were described by five free physical parameters  : n ( ) , n ( ) , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 . the best fitting model with 3 main components ( model  4 ) allows for additional free parameters characterizing the local continuum to improve the fit .",
    "bt conclude , however , that `` the model fit to ly@xmath3 is not as good as ly@xmath4 , there is under - absorption in two places near d - ly@xmath3 ''",
    ".    the present letter is primarily aimed at the inverse problem in the analysis of the h+d ly-@xmath4 and ly-@xmath3 absorption observed by tfb .",
    "it is shown that the mesoturbulent model based on only 5 physical parameters and an appropriate velocity field configuration is a sufficient description of the d  ly-@xmath4 and ly-@xmath3 lines with no free parameters in the continuum .",
    "it is generally believed that the lyman limit systems arise in the outer regions of intervening galactic halos .",
    "we assume that the background ionizing radiation at @xmath34 is hard enough to keep the absorbing gas photoionized with @xmath35 k. a galaxy halo is considered to be a continuous medium exhibiting a mixture of bulk motions such as infall and outflows , rotation , tidal flows etc .",
    "the motion along the line of sight is then characterized by a fluctuating velocity field which we consider as random . for the sake of simplicity , we assume a homogeneous ( - ) density and temperature @xmath36 .",
    "the model closely follows the papers by levshakov & kegel ( 1997 ; paper  i ) , levshakov , kegel & mazets ( 1997 ; paper  ii ) and levshakov , kegel & takahara ( 1997 ; paper  iii ) ; the reader is referred to these papers for more details .",
    "here we only note that although the distribution function for the fluctuating velocity field is assumed to be gaussian _ on average _ , the resulting velocity distribution along a _ given _ line of sight may deviate significantly from this .    to estimate physical parameters and an appropriate velocity field structure along the sightline , we used a reverse monte carlo [ rmc ] technique described in paper  iii .",
    "the algorithm requires to define a simulation box for the 5 physical parameters  : n ( ) , d / h , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 [ here @xmath39 denotes the _ rms _ velocity , @xmath40 the thermal width of the hydrogen lines , @xmath41 the correlation length , and @xmath42 the typical thickness of the absorbing region ] . ",
    "the continuous random function @xmath43 is represented by its sampled values at equal space intervals @xmath44 , i.e. by the vector @xmath45 of the velocity components parallel to the line of sight at the spatial points @xmath46 ( see paper  ii ) .    in the present study",
    "we adopt for the physical parameters the following boundaries  : n ( ) ranges from @xmath47 to @xmath48 @xmath7 ; d / h  from @xmath49 to @xmath50 ; @xmath36  from @xmath51 to @xmath52 k. for @xmath37 the boundaries were set from 1.0 to 4.0 to cover the @xmath39-range estimated from the kinematic structure of the galactic halos observed at @xmath53 [ @xmath54 km s@xmath15 , van ojik et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ] . since for @xmath55",
    "the meso- and microturbulent profiles tend to be identical ( paper  i ) , we consider here only moderate @xmath38 ratios in the range 1.0    5.0 .",
    "similar to bt , we assume that the d and h lines are not required to have the identical velocities as the metal lines from the same system , and that only the higher order lyman series lines can trace the neutral hydrogen distribution .",
    "but we fix @xmath56 = 3.5723145 ( the mean @xmath31 between the blue and the red components of the metal lines observed by tfb ) as a more or less arbitrary reference radial velocity at which @xmath57 .",
    "having specified the parameter space , we construct the objective function ( similar to that in paper  iii ) to calculate @xmath58 .",
    "the objective function includes the following portions of the lyman series lines which after preliminary analysis were chosen as most appropriate to the simultaneous rmc fitting  : for h+d ly-@xmath4 and ly-@xmath3 , @xmath59 ranges from @xmath60 to @xmath61 km  s@xmath15 ( see fig .",
    "1*a , b * ) ; for ly-14 , 18 km  s@xmath62 km  s@xmath15 ( fig .",
    "1*i * ) ; for ly-15 , @xmath63    ( fig .  1*j",
    "* ) . in the q  1937 - 1009 spectrum",
    ", there are many additional absorbers blending the lyman series lines .",
    "we do not fit these additional absorptions since they do not affect significantly the d / h measurement in this system as shown by bt .",
    "the strongest absorption feature seen at @xmath64 ( @xmath65 km  s@xmath15 in fig .",
    "1*a - i * ) has , according to bt , n ( ) = @xmath66 @xmath7 , which is less than 1% of the total n ( ) at @xmath67 .",
    "the estimated parameters for a few adequate rmc profile fits are listed in table  1 .",
    "we tried to find a satisfactory result with the reduced @xmath68 per degree of freedom of @xmath69 ( where @xmath70 is the expected @xmath68 value for @xmath71 degrees of freedom at the credible probability of 95% ) . in table  1 , the @xmath58 values are shown for the blue wings of the h+d ly-@xmath4 and ly-@xmath3 lines ( @xmath72 , @xmath60  km  s@xmath73 km  s@xmath15 , and @xmath74 ) , which are the only lines with the observable d - absorption .",
    "moreover , these pairs are more sensitive to the fitting procedure due to the highest s / n data obtained .",
    "slightly lower @xmath68 values were found in the combination with the ly-14 and ly-15 lines which , however , have smaller weights since their data are noisy . to illustrate our results ,",
    "we show in fig .  1 the best rmc solution with the lowest @xmath58 value ( model * d * ) .    to check the rmc solutions , we calculated hydrogen profiles up to ly-23 for each model and then superposed them to the corresponding parts of the q  1937 - 1009 spectrum .",
    "for all models from table  1 the results are similar to that shown in fig .  1 .",
    "we do not find any pronounced discordance of calculated and real spectra .",
    "the derived @xmath43-configurations are not unique .",
    "table  1 demonstrates the spread of the rms turbulent velocities from @xmath75 km  s@xmath15 to @xmath76 km s@xmath15 .",
    "the projected velocity distribution functions @xmath77 differ considerably from a gaussian .",
    "2 shows as an example for such a distorted distribution ( solid line histogram ) the case of model * d*. by dotted lines we show three @xmath77 for bt s best fit model with three components ( model  4 ) .",
    "both the rmc @xmath77 and the combined bt @xmath77 distributions are asymmetric .",
    "however , the rmc solution shows a stronger blue gradient as compared with bt .",
    "this is the main reason why the absorption in the blue wing of the ly-@xmath3 line is enhanced without any additional interloper(s ) .",
    "we have shown that the interpretation of the q  1937 - 1009 spectrum obtained by tfb is not unique .",
    "the data can be modeled with a higher d / h ratio if one accounts for spatial correlations in the large scale velocity field .",
    "the most accurate and robust rmc solution ( model * d * ) was obtained with a total hydrogen column density outside the range found by burles & tytler ( 1997 ) but in good agreement with the songaila ( 1998 ) estimate .",
    "of course , our analysis gives a certain _ range _ for n()@xmath28 and d / h ( see table  1 ) .",
    "however , this range narrows if we require the d / h value to be compatible with the results of our previous analyses of the absorption toward q  1009 + 2956 ( @xmath8 ) ( paper  iii ) and toward q  1718 + 4807 ( @xmath9 ) ( levshakov et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "the range common to all three analyses is d / h @xmath10 .",
    "this implies for q  1937 - 1009 n ( ) @xmath78 @xmath7 , showing that model * d * is well within this range . from sbbn",
    "it follows that d / h @xmath10 implies for the baryon - to - photon ratio , @xmath11 , a value in the interval @xmath79 . with the present - day photon density determined from the cosmic microwave background ( e.g. fixen et al . 1996 ) , one then estimates the present - day baryon density to be in the range @xmath80 .",
