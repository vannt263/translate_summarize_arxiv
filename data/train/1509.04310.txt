    "<S> the geometric phase deficit is defined as the difference between the geometric phase acquired by the global system and sum of the geometric phases acquired by subsystems during local unitary evolutions . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a non - zero value of the geometric phase deficit for a composite quantum system can be a signature of quantum entanglement . in the context of macroscopic quantum systems , we illustrate how the geometric phase deficit can be used to detect macroscopically entangled states . in particular , we use the geometric phase deficit to detect the entanglement for macroscopic superposition of coherent states . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that by measuring the geometric phase deficit one can measure the concurrence of two spin singlets between distant boundaries </S>",
    "<S> .    introduction    berry s phase , alternatively called as the panchratnam phase @xcite has been a subject of great importance in quantum mechanics . when a quantal system is subjected to variation which is adiabatic in nature , e.g. , a quantum system in an eigenstate </S>",
    "<S> is slowly transported round a circuit by varying parameters of the hamiltonian , it acquires an extra phase factor . </S>",
    "<S> this is not just the dynamical change of the phase but an additional phase that depends on the path in the parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> berry s phase was initially defined for evolutions of quantal systems that are adiabatic and cyclic in nature . </S>",
    "<S> later , it was generalized by anandan and aharnov @xcite for non adiabatic but cyclic evolutions of quantum system and by samuel and bhandari @xcite for noncyclic evolutions . </S>",
    "<S> the cyclic evolution means that the system returns to its original state after the evolution and the additional phase appears due to the geometry of the curve formed during the motion of the system in the projective hilbert space .    </S>",
    "<S> this generalization by anandan and aharnov is striking enough as it ensures that in quantum mechanics the quantum geometric phase exists for cyclic evolutions of quantum system . the geometric phase for an arbitrary quantum evolution </S>",
    "<S> has already been given by one of the authors @xcite using the reference section of the bundle covering the curve in the projective hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the geometric phase some other geometric structures like the length of the curve and distance also exist during a quantum evolution . the geometric phase for a noncyclic but adiabatic evolution @xcite </S>",
    "<S> is also connected to the hannay angle as explicitly as for the adiabatic cyclic evolution . </S>",
    "<S> geometric phase has important applications in geometric quantum computation @xcite , molecular dynamics @xcite and response function of the many - body system @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in general , without taking into account the initial ideas of adiabaticity , cyclicity , and unitarity for geometric phase , if a quantal system undergoes an evolution and the initial and final states belong to two different fibers @xcite , we can can compute the phase difference in the process of evolution by the inner product between the states before and after evolution , with an exception that the initial and final states are not orthogonal . the phase difference was defined in this manner by panachratnam @xcite in case of polarization states of light . </S>",
    "<S> the notion of relative phase has also been generalized for mixed states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the concept of geometric phase for mixed states based on interferometry is different than the one proposed earlier @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> geometric phase has also been studied for open quantum systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , abelian geometric phase shift was given by guise _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite and the scheme for producing and measuring the same in a three - level system was also presented @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum entanglement @xcite being at the heart of quantum information theory @xcite , its detection plays very important role in quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> there are several methods to measure the bipartite entanglement in quantum systems and it has also been generalized to multipartite quantum systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are various methods to detect entanglement @xcite in quantum systems and we try to explore a possible one here for pure states in bipartite as well as multipartite quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> the connection of geometric phase and entanglement has also been studied and the noncyclic geometric phase for entangled states was calculated by sjqvist @xcite . the geometric phase for mixed </S>",
    "<S> state has been studied and it was shown that uhlmann s geometric phase @xcite for mixed state evolution through unitary transformation not only depends on the geometry of the path but also on the constrained bi - local unitary evolution of the purified entangled state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> geometric phase has been studied for bipartite and multipartite entangled systems @xcite and in the case of bipartite states it is also connected to that of their subsystems for some specific quantum evolutions . </S>",
    "<S> the composite systems being two coupled spin half particles is calculated and related to their subsystems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of quantum entanglement is studied via the geometric phase in quantum spin chains @xcite .    since , in principle , quantum mechanics may permit the existence of a macroscopic object which is in a quantum superposition , it has become very important to study the macroscopic quantumness and macroscopic entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> there has been several proposals to quantify macroscopicity based on different criteria involving effective number of particles in the superposition states , dishtinguishability and operational interpretations etc @xcite . in recent years </S>",
    "<S> , macroscopic quantum states have been proposed in various systems such as superconductors @xcite , nanoscale qubits @xcite , trapped ions @xcite , and photonic qubits in microwave cavity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> constructing such macroscopically superposed states @xcite , studying and detecting entanglement in such macroscopic states are need of the hour to understand the extent of applicability of quantum mechanics .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we make use of the notion of the geometric phase deficit during arbitrary local unitary evolution of a macroscopic quantum system and show how one can detect entanglement using the geometric phase deficit . </S>",
    "<S> a bipartite pure quantum system , subjected to local unitary evolution acquires a geometric phase during the evolution . </S>",
    "<S> however , the individual subsystems also acquire their respective geometric phases during the evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we show that if the state is separable , then the difference in the global geometric phase and sum of the local geometric phases , which we call as the geometric phase deficit , will be zero . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a nonzero value of the geometric phase deficit acquired by the pure composite system is a signature of entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , a non - zero geometric phase deficit for multipartite pure state can detect entanglement . for mixed composite states , the non - zero geometric phase deficit can be a signature of non - zero mutual information and hence total correlation in the system . </S>",
    "<S> we show how the geometric phase deficit can be a signature of entanglement in macroscopic superposition of quantum states . </S>",
    "<S> such quantum superpositions are studied here in order to detect macroscopic entanglement in composite quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , in some specific examples , we show that the entropy of entanglement for macroscopic system can be expressed solely using the geometric phase deficit . </S>",
    "<S> + this paper is organized as follows . in section </S>",
    "<S> ii , we define the geometric phase deficit for bipartite systems under local unitary evolutions and show that its nonzero value is a sufficient condition for entanglement . in section iii , we generalize the geometric phase deficit for multi - particle quantum system under local unitary evolutions . in section iv , this formalism is extended to mixed quantum states using density operator representation . </S>",
    "<S> section v , illustrates with the help of two examples that the geometric phase deficit provides an insight to reveal macroscopic entanglement . </S>"
