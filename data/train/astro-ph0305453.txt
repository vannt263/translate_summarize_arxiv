    "galactic cosmic rays ( gcr ) originate outside the solar system .",
    "they comprise protons ( 85@xmath0 ) , alpha particles ( 14@xmath0 ) and heavy nuclei .",
    "interaction with large - scale ordered magnetic field causes the gradient- and curvature - drift motion of gcr in the inner heliosphere , while the interaction with the irregular ( stochastic ) field component results in the pitch angle scattering of gcr .",
    "the scale sizes for the two effects , drifts which depend on variations in the mean field on the order of the heliocentric radial distance , and diffusion which depends on irregularities of sizes comparable to the particles gyro - radii , are quite distinct ( see , for instance @xcite,@xcite and references therein ) .    until recently space instruments have lacked the combination of large geometrical factor and good mass resolution required to address the question of the variation on _ short _ time scales of individual nuclides other than @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in present letter",
    "we report on an investigation of the flux fluctuations of gcr nuclei ( carbon - @xmath3 : @xmath4 ) based on the data obtained by instrumentation carried aboard the advanced composition explorer ( ace ) spacecraft for 2000 year .",
    "the intensities of these low energy particles have been continuously monitored by the cosmic ray isotope spectrometr ( cris ) .    in order to get away from the effects of the earth s magnetic field , the ace spacecraft orbits at the l1 libration point which is a point of earth - sun gravitational equilibrium about 1.5 million km from earth and 148.5 million km from the sun .",
    "the large collecting power and high resolution of the cris instrument allow us to investigate modulation of gcr flux on short time scales ( beginning from 1 hour ) and in different energy ranges .",
    "current theories of parallel and perpendicular diffusion are fairly well accepted for high energy particles .",
    "however , there are important outstanding issues pertaining to diffusion and transport of charged particles at medium to low energies .",
    "the particles at low energies are believed interact directly with the steepened dissipation range that sets in near the ion inertial scale .",
    "dynamical scattering theory suggests that these particles may be sensitive to ( 1 ) the dynamical decorrelation mechanism that operates at these scales ; ( 2 ) the `` geometry '' of the fluctuations in the dissipation range ; and ( 3 ) the spectral distribution of power at the small scales @xcite .",
    "+ multiscaling properties of cosmic rays have been already discussed in the light of the data obtained by neutron monitors with cut - off rigity 1.09 gev ( see , for instance , @xcite,@xcite and references therein ) as well as modulation of the cosmic rays by solar wind turbulence and magnetic field intermittency @xcite-@xcite . however , as far as we know , multiscaling analysis of the gcr heavy nuclei data obtained by satellite instruments is performed here for the first time .",
    "this analysis reveals a strong ( turbulent - like ) intermittency of the gcr dissipation rate and dependence of the intermittency type from the energy ranges ( not to be confused with the hep multiplicity intermittency @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "differential flux of the gcr : @xmath5 , as measured by cris , is proportional to the normal component of the velocity field of the gcr : @xmath6 , and to their local concentarion : @xmath7 , @xmath8 fluctuations of @xmath5 with time are then determined by corresponding fluctuations of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "dissipation of passive admixture concentration in fluid turbulence is characterized by a `` gradient '' measure @xcite-@xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a subvolume with space - scale @xmath11 ( for detail justification of this measure see handbook @xcite : p. 381 and",
    "further ) . scaling law of this measure moments , @xmath12 is an important characteristic of the dissipation rate field just in _ inertial _ interval of turbulence ( see , for instance , @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "analogous measure is used to characterize also dissipation rate of turbulent velocity ( or kinetic energy ) in the inertial interval of scales @xcite-@xcite .    for turbulent flows the taylor hypothesis",
    "is generally used to interpret the data @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "this hypothesis states that the intrinsic time dependence of the wavefields ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) can be ignored when the turbulence is convected past the probes at nearly constant speed . with this hypothesis",
    ", the temporal dynamics should reflect the spatial one , i.e. the fluctuating velocity ( concentration ) field measured by a given probe as a function of time , @xmath13 is the same as the velocity @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the mean velocity and @xmath16 is the distance to a position `` upstream '' where the velocity is measured at @xmath17 .    with the taylor hypothesis @xmath18",
    "is replaced by @xmath19 and one can define gcr flux dissipation rate as : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and corresponding scaling of the dissipation rate moments as @xcite : @xmath22    substituting ( 1 ) into ( 4 ) one can estimate the gcr flux dissipation rate through characteristics of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we can consider two asymptotic regimes .",
    "for sufficiently small gcr energies the flux dissipation rate has been dominated by the concentration dissipation : @xmath23^p \\rangle \\sim \\tau^{-\\mu_p }     \\eqno{(6)}\\ ] ] while for sufficiently large gcr energies the flux dissipation rate has been dominated by the energy ( velocity ) dissipation : @xmath24^p \\rangle \\sim \\tau^{-\\mu_p }     \\eqno{(7)}\\ ] ]",
    "as it was mentioned in introduction we will use the data collected by ace / cris instrument during 2000 year ( the year of maximum solar activity ) .",
    "we will consider carbon nuclei @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , due to carbon is the lightest abundant nuclei ( after @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) in the ace / cris collection . as we shall see",
    "this fact allow us consider the both asymptotes mentioned in previous section .",
    "figure 1a shows scaling of the gcr flux dissipation rate moments @xmath25 ( 4)-(5 ) for the c - nuclei with energies from energy range : 56.3 - 73.4 mev / nucleon ( the lowest energy range in the ace / cris collection for carbon ) .",
    "figure 1b shows the scaling exponents @xmath26 ( circles ) extracted from figure 1a ( as slopes of the straight lines , cf ( 5 ) ) .",
    "the solid curve in figure 1b corresponds to the intermittency exponents @xmath26 obtained for the _ inertial_-convective region of a passive admixture concentration in a laboratory turbulent air flow @xcite . to support the striking correspondence between the two data sets multiscaling",
    "let us calculate also the extended self - similarity ( ess @xcite ) exponents , @xmath27 , extracted from equation : @xmath28 the ess of type ( 8) usually has clearer scaling form than ordinary scaling ( 5 ) and covers a wider range of scales ( see @xcite for a review of ess and for examples ) .",
    "figure 2a shows the ess of the gcr flux dissipation rate moments @xmath25 ( 8) using log - log scales .",
    "the straight lines ( the best fit ) are drawn to indicate the ess ( 8) .",
    "figure 2b shows the ess exponents @xmath27 ( circles ) extracted from figure 2a ( as slopes of the straight lines , cf ( 8) ) .",
    "the solid curve in figure 2b corresponds to the intermittency exponents @xmath27 obtained for the _ inertial_-convective region of passive admixture concentration in different laboratory turbulent flows @xcite .",
    "now let us turn to the data corresponding to energy range with the highest for the carbon nuclei energies observed by ace / cris .",
    "figure 3a shows scaling of the gcr flux dissipation rate moments @xmath25 ( 4)-(5 ) for the c - nuclei with energies from energy range : 183.1 - 198.7 mev / nucleon .",
    "figure 3b shows the scaling exponents @xmath26 ( circles ) extracted from figure 3a ( as slopes of the straight lines , cf ( 5 ) ) .",
    "the solid curve in figure 3b corresponds to the intermittency exponents @xmath26 calculated using the she - leveque model @xcite , which is in very good agreement with the data for _ velocity _ ( kinetic energy dissipation ) field intermittency obtained in _ inertial _",
    "interval for isotropic fluid turbulence .",
    "figures 4a and 4b shows corresponding extended self - similarity ( ess ) properties @xmath29 observed for the data . again , as in figure 3b , correspondence to the fluid turbulence ( energy dissipation rate - the solid curve in figure 4b ) is very good .",
    "the interval of time scales under consideration is 1 - 30 hours .",
    "it seems to be useful to compare the observed properties of gcr flux dissipation rate with relevant properties of the local interplanetary magnetic field .",
    "figure 5 shows energy spectrum of 3d magnetic field measured by ace / mag magnetometer in the same time intervals as the ace / cris data .",
    "the slope -5/3 indicates kolmogorov - like scaling ( cf @xcite ) .",
    "let us recall that the turbulent fluid dissipation rates used for comparison in figures 1 - 4 were obtained just for inertial ( inertial - convection ) interval of scales where the kolmogorov - like scaling should to be expected @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the results of previous section seems to be in agreement with the qualitative estimates made in section 2 : for relatively small energies the flux dissipation rate behaves as one dominated by the gcr particles concentration dissipation rate , whereas for relatively large energies the gcr flux dissipation rate seems to be dominated by velocity ( kinetic energy ) dissipation .    since cris instrument measures the differential flux ( @xmath5 ) only , but not the velocity of gcr ( @xmath6 ) and their concentration ( @xmath7 ) separately ( cf ( 1 ) ) we have no idea about magnitudes of the fluctuations of @xmath6 and @xmath7 themselves .",
    "therefore existence of the two asymptotes ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) is still a pure phenomenology ( for the intermediate energies the scaling is deformed by competition between the two different mechanisms of the flux dissipation ) .",
    "the same reason ( unknown @xmath6 and @xmath7 for the gcr ) makes it impossible to perform any theoretical estimates for the scales of the gcr flux dissipation rate multiscaling .    although correspondence between the motions in mhd and hydro cases has been reported earlier ( see , for instance , very recent paper @xcite and references therein ) it is much more difficult to understand such detail correspondence between cosmic rays and fluid turbulence . indeed , as it follows from previous two sections the observed gcr particles dissipation rate exhibits intermittent properties of a passive admixture convected by turbulent motion of a classic ( isotropic , incompressible ) non - magnetic fluid .",
    "while the solar wind ( including the interplanetary magnetic field - imf ) is certainly very different from such a fluid . moreover , interaction of the electrically charged gcr particles with the solar wind and the magnetic field is expected to have strong resonance features ( see , for instance , @xcite-@xcite,@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , even the fact that many characteristics of solar wind and imf turbulence are known to be similar to those of turbulence of classic non - magnetic fluids ( see @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) the presumably",
    "_ resonance_-like interactions of gcr particles with solar wind and imf seems to be non - consistent with the observed here picture , that request reconsideration of our approach to stochastic _",
    "short_-term convection of the low - energy gcr particles ( heavy nuclei ) in the heliosphere and their _ short_-term interactions with solar wind and imf .",
    "this reconsideration represents a serious challenge for a wide scientific community : both for astrophysicists and for plasma experts .",
    "+ the author is grateful to ace / cris and to ace / mag instrument teams as well as to the ace science center for providing the data .",
