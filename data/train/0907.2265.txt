    "when two nuclei collide in non - central heavy - ion collisions , their overlap area in the transverse plane has a short axis , which is parallel to the impact parameter , and a long axis , which is perpendicular to it .",
    "this initial spatial anisotropy of the overlap region of the colliding nuclei is transformed into an anisotropy in momentum space through interactions between the particles .",
    "the magnitude of this effect is characterized by elliptic flow , defined as @xmath2where @xmath3 is azimuthal angle of an outgoing particle , @xmath4 is the azimuthal angle of the impact parameter , and angular brackets denote an average over many particles and events .",
    "the characterization of the elliptic flow of produced particles by their azimuthal anisotropy has proven to be one of the more fruitful probes of the dynamics in collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider(rhic )  @xcite , see recent review in  @xcite .",
    "it can provide much information about the degree of thermalization of the hot and dense medium .",
    "a systematic study of the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath0 for different particle species enables investigation of underlying phenomena and the properties of the produced matter .",
    "in this proceeding , we report @xmath0 measurements by the star experiment from = 200 gev and collisions . data were taken from run 5 ( 2005 ) and run 7 ( 2007 ) .",
    "star s time projection chamber ( tpc )  @xcite is used as the main detector for particle identification and event plane determination .",
    "the centrality was determined by the number of tracks from the pseudorapidity region @xmath5 .",
    "two forward time projection chambers ( ftpcs ) were also used for event plane determinations .",
    "the ftpcs cover 2.5 @xmath6 4 .",
    "the pseudorapidity gap between ftpc and tpc allows us to reduce some of the non - flow effects . in collisions ,",
    "the difference between @xmath0(tpc ) ( event plane determined by tpc tracks ) and @xmath0(ftpc ) ( event plane determined by ftpc tracks ) has been used to estimate the systematic errors , where in collisions , we used @xmath0(ftpc ) for the measurement , @xmath7(ftpc )  @xcite ( subtracting the residual non - flow effects based on the azimuthal correlations in collisions ) for the systematic study .",
    "the pid is achieved via de / dx in tpc and topologically reconstructed hadrons : @xmath8 @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 @xmath11 @xmath15 ( @xmath16 @xmath17 +  @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 @xmath11 @xmath20 ( @xmath21 @xmath17 +  @xmath22 ) .",
    "the detailed description of the procedure can be found in refs .",
    "-.0 cm -.0 cm     results using ideal hydrodynamical calculations  @xcite have been able to reproduce mass ordering of @xmath0 in the low @xmath1 region in au+au collisions .",
    "figure 1 shows the @xmath0 for @xmath8 , @xmath11 and @xmath23 as a function of @xmath1 in different centrality selections for collisions along with results of hydrodynamical calculations  @xcite .",
    "we observe that @xmath0 for @xmath11 is smaller than @xmath0 for @xmath8 for @xmath1 @xmath24 2 gev / c . for @xmath1 @xmath25 2",
    "gev / c , @xmath0 for @xmath11 becomes larger than that of @xmath8 .",
    "we have also found @xmath23 has sizable @xmath0 in minimum bias 0 - 60 % centrality .",
    "the ideal hydrodynamical model does not describe the centrality dependence of our data . for 0 - 20 %",
    ", the model under - predicts the data and for 20 - 60 % , it over - predicts the @xmath0 .",
    "effects not included in the model which may be relevant are geometrical fluctuations in the initial conditions ( particularly important in central collisions ) , finite viscosity effects and incomplete thermalization .",
    "it remains to be seen if these effects can account for the difference between the models and data .",
    "-.0 cm .0 cm     quark coalescence  @xcite or recombination  @xcite mechanisms in particle production predict that at intermediate @xmath1 ( 2 @xmath26 5 ) number of quark ( nq ) scaled @xmath0 will follow a universal curve .",
    "thus , the nq scaling is considered evidence for partonic degrees of freedom in au + au collisions at = 200 gev  @xcite . with the large statistics from run 7 , we can test the scaling in the large @xmath1 region .",
    "figure 2 shows the number of quark scaled @xmath0 for identified particles as a function of @xmath27 in and collisions at = 200 gev .",
    "proton and @xmath11 begin to deviate from the nq scaling when @xmath28 in the case .",
    "scaling behavior can be seen in the smaller system ( ) at the same energy .",
    "-0.5 cm     figure 3 shows the @xmath0 for @xmath3 and @xmath29 together with @xmath0 for @xmath30 and @xmath31 as a function of @xmath1 in minimum bias collisions at = 200 gev .",
    "the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath0 for @xmath30 and @xmath31 is observed to be similar as the corresponding results for @xmath29 baryons and @xmath3 mesons .",
    "this indicates that the heavier s quarks flow as strongly as the lighter u and d quarks , providing evidence for partonic collectivity .",
    "in summary , we present the results from a systematic analysis of the identified particles elliptic flow ( @xmath32 ) measurement from and collisions at = 200 gev .",
    "ideal hydrodynamic model calculations fail to reproduce the data in collisions .",
    "proton and @xmath11 begin to deviate from the nq scaling when @xmath28 in collisions ; scaling behavior can be seen in the smaller system ( ) . the fact that the @xmath3 and @xmath29 @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) follows a similar trend as that of @xmath30 and @xmath31 indicates that the heavier s quarks flow as strongly as the lighter u and d quarks suggesting partonic collectivity has been established at rhic .",
