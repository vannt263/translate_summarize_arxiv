    "ever since the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity in cuprates,@xcite understanding the motion of a hole in an otherwise half - filled cuo@xmath0 layer has been a major challenge in condensed matter physics.@xcite if , as most customary , one models this system with a one - band hubbard model,@xcite then in the limit of a large on - site repulsion @xmath1 the half - filled case maps onto an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) heisenberg hamiltonian with spin - exchange coupling @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) hopping.@xcite in this limit , then , the problem reduces to understanding the motion of a hole in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) afm background.@xcite    a major reason for the difficulty in dealing with this question is that despite being long - range ordered at @xmath4 , the undoped afm background has a very complicated wavefunction due to spin fluctuations , which make it very unlike the semi - classical nel state .",
    "a simple but more realistic description that could be used for analytical purposes is missing ; as a result , progress has been made primarily through numerical simulations.@xcite    here , we present an essentially exact numerical solution , and an approximate but quite accurate analytical approach , for the much simpler issue of a hole moving in an ising afm background,@xcite whose undoped wavefunction is the nel state . the solutions have a variational interpretation , and are shown to be accurate for a wide range of parameters , of up to @xmath5 .",
    "the generally accepted view , which probably explains why this problem has not been solved so far ( to the best of our knowledge ) , is that a hole can not really move in an ising afm , since as it hops away from its initial location it re - shuffles the spins at the sites it visits , creating a string of `` defects '' ( misaligned spins ) . in dimensions",
    "higher than one , the energy cost of this string increases roughly linearly with its length , and as a result the hole is forced to stay in the vicinity of its original position , i.e. its effective mass is infinite.@xcite in this view , spin fluctuations which effectively remove ( or `` heal '' ) pieces of this string of defects are needed to free the hole and allow it to acquire a finite effective mass . of course",
    ", such spin fluctuations are absent in an ising afm .",
    "that the hole is not truly localized even in an ising afm has been known ever since trugman pointed out@xcite that by going twice around a closed loop , the hole can actually acquire a finite effective mass .",
    "we will return to this in more detail below , but the main idea is that while the first circuit along the closed loop creates the usual chain of defects , the second reshuffle of the spins during the second circuit removes all these defects , but also ends with the hole at a different location than the original site . by repeating such processes , the hole can therefore move anywhere on its original sublattice .",
    "even though trugman started from a nel background and identified this mechanism for generating a finite quasiparticle mass in the absence of spin fluctuations , he included spin - fluctuations in his calculation by considering the full heisenberg afm hamiltonian when determine the effective mass of the hole.@xcite the issue of the hole mass in a purely ising afm thus remained unanswered .",
    "here we carry out this calculation , and show that the hole is fairly mobile if @xmath6 . moreover , if a transverse magnetic field is turned on , due to aharonov - bohm interference of the peierls phases associated with these closed loops , the effective hoppings acquire a magnetic field dependence over and above the usual peierls phases , with interesting consequences .",
    "our results reveal that even this seemingly simple problem is actually very interesting and leads to rather non - trivial results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we specify the model and our notation . in sec .",
    "iii , we describe the analytical calculation in the smallest variational subspace where the hole acquires mass , both with and without magnetic field .",
    "we then explain the generalization for the numerical calculation .",
    "section  iv contains our results , and a summary and final conclusions appear in sec .",
    "consider a spin-@xmath7 ising afm on a square lattice @xmath8   = \\bar{\\jmath } \\sum_{\\langle i , j\\rangle}^ { } \\left(\\sigma_{i , z }   \\sigma_{j , z }   -1\\right)\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the pauli matrix , and @xmath10 .",
    "the ground state is the classical nel state , with all spins on sublattice @xmath11 up , and all spins on sublattice @xmath12 down , @xmath13 where @xmath14 annihilates an electron at site @xmath15 , and for convenience we shifted the energy so that @xmath16{c } \\sigma_i^{- } , \\mbox { if } i\\in a \\\\ \\sigma_i^{+ } , \\mbox { if } i\\in b   \\\\ \\end{array } \\right.\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 are the raising / lowering pauli matrices , and hole creation operators @xmath18{c } c_{i,\\uparrow } , \\mbox { if } i\\in a",
    "\\\\ c_{i,\\downarrow } , \\mbox { if } i\\in b   \\\\ \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] for a hole at the site @xmath15 . with this notation , for example",
    "@xmath19 means that the hole is at site @xmath15 and the spin at site @xmath20 is flipped ; all other sites have their spins in the proper nel configuration .",
    "consider now the motion of the hole , with the no - double occupancy condition enforced .",
    "if the hole is at site @xmath15 , the only possibility is for an electron from one of its four nn sites @xmath21 to hop into @xmath15 , thus moving the hole to site @xmath21 .",
    "if the spin of the electron at @xmath21 was properly oriented , when it moves to @xmath15 it has the wrong orientation ; in other words , a `` defect '' is created at @xmath15 when the hole hops from @xmath22 . on the other hand , if there was a `` defect '' at @xmath21 to begin with , when the electron moves to @xmath15 it will be properly oriented , and therefore the `` defect '' at @xmath21 is removed as the hole hops from @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian that describes the dynamics of the hole in the 2d ising afm is @xmath23 p +   { \\cal h}_{\\rm afm}.\\ ] ] the projector @xmath24 enforces the no - double occupancy constraint , as well as the condition that each site has either the hole , or a spin : @xmath25 . in the presence of a uniform transverse magnetic field @xmath12 ,",
    "the hopping integrals @xmath26 include the proper peierls factors ( see below ) .",
    "this hamiltonian is similar to the edwards model,@xcite however , unlike that model it enforces ( i ) the fact that there can be no magnons at the site where the hole is , i.e. states like @xmath27 are forbidden ; ( ii ) the fact that there can be at most one spin - flip per site , i.e. states like @xmath28 are forbidden . finally , ( iii ) unlike the edwards model , where the energy of the defects was assumed to be described by @xmath29 , here we use @xmath30 to calculate the true cost for creating spin flips  two neighboring defects",
    "cost less energy than two farther - apart ones , because they only disrupt seven afm bonds , not eight .",
    "such corrections are less important than is imposing ( i ) and ( ii ) , but keeping track of the proper exchange energies is simple enough and we do so .",
    "note that a description of a heisenberg afm would require the addition of terms @xmath31 , describing the xy spin - exchange interaction leading to spin fluctuations . however , since the nel ground - state @xmath32 is not a good approximation for the undoped ground state of this model , it is hard to quantify the meaning of adding these terms .",
    "spin fluctuations could also be introduced with a small magnetic field parallel to the @xmath33-axis , leading to a term @xmath34 , as considered in the edwards model.@xcite as shown there , such terms do significantly lower the effective mass of the hole , but we ignore them here .",
    "we begin by considering the case where no transverse magnetic field is applied . in this case",
    ", the unit cell contains two sites ( one from sublattice @xmath11 , one from sublattice @xmath12 ) and the corresponding magnetic brillouin zone is a square rotated by @xmath36 ( see below ) . for each @xmath37 in this brillouin zone , we define the plane wave @xmath38 and want to calculate the green s function @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the resolvent associated with this hamiltonian , @xmath41 is infinitesimally small , and we set @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 denotes the number of unit cells , or the number of sites in each sublattice , and is taken to infinity .",
    "besides producing the single - hole spectrum from its poles , the spectral function @xmath44 is the quantity that would be measured by spin - polarized arpes , assuming that a ( photo)electron with spin - up is removed from the system .",
    "of course , there is a second set of wavefunctions consisting of plane waves involving the sites on sublattice @xmath12 ; their associated green s function would be related to arpes measured when a spin - down electron was ejected from the system .",
    "obviously , the spectral weights are identical for the two cases .",
    "as discussed , as the hole hops away from its initial site , it creates a string of defects as it reshuffles the spins on its path .",
    "these defects increase the energy of the state roughly linearly with the length of the string , because of the broken afm bonds . in the absence of spin fluctuations , there are only two ways to remove this costly string of misaligned spins .",
    "one is for the hole to retrace its path , removing all the defects  in this case it ends up at the original site it started from.@xcite such terms can only renormalize the overall energy , but do not generate dispersion .",
    "the second possibility is for the hole to go repeatedly around closed loops : on the first circuit a string of defects is created , while on the second circuit the defects are removed .",
    "these loops generate effective second and third nn hopping terms , as counted in the original square lattice .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show examples of the shortest sequences of events that result in generating such 2nd ( a ) and 3rd ( b ) nn hoppings.@xcite one can easily convince oneself that longer closed loops can only contribute to one of these two effective hoppings , since the final location of the hole is within two hops of the original one . effective nn hopping is impossible , because of spin conservation : if the hole is on the other sublattice , there must be an odd number of magnons around .    ]    in perturbational terms , for @xmath45 , the sequence of hoppings depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) results in 2nd nn hopping @xmath46 , since the initial and final states , which are both in the no - defect manifold , are connected through 6 hopping processes , and the five intermediary states have energies higher by @xmath47 respectively .",
    "similarly , fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) gives a contribution to 3rd nn hopping @xmath48 , as the longer strings of defects are more costly .",
    "note that clockwise hopping of the hole around the same loop as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) would generate a higher - order contribution to the 2nd nn hopping @xmath49 because some of the intermediary states have slightly different energies .",
    "this allows us to estimate the range where perturbation theory is valid . if we ask that @xmath50 , so that this correction from 5-defect processes to the 3-defect result is small , we find @xmath51 . in other words , because of the relatively long and thus energetically costly loops of flipped spins involved in generating the effective hoppings , perturbation theory extends up to rather large values @xmath52 . for comparison , in cuprates",
    "it is believed that @xmath53 , so they would be just outside the perturbational range ( for these values , @xmath54 ) .",
    "of course , the effects of spin fluctuations can not be ignored in the cuprates .",
    "clearly , then , for @xmath55 the dominant contribution to the hole s dynamics comes from the processes of fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "we therefore begin by calculating @xmath56 in a variational approach , by only allowing such short loops ( with up to 3 defects on 3 corners on a square plaquette ) to be generated .",
    "longer loops are more expensive and the probability to generate them should be lower . of course",
    ", they can be included in a numerical calculation , but this will lead to only quantitative , not qualitative changes ( see below ) .",
    "the method we use is similar to that used in refs .   for the 1d , and in ref .",
    "for the 2d edwards model . within this variational approximation",
    ", we generate the equations of motion for the propagator by using repeatedly the dyson identity @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the resolvent for @xmath59 , while @xmath60 is the first term in eq .",

    "the new propagators are @xmath67 and are related to the amplitude of probability to propagate between a no - defect state and a 1-defect state such as the second state shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , with a defect at the original site . in the following ,",
    "for simplicity we will denote @xmath68 as @xmath69 .",
    "an equation of motion for @xmath70 can now be generated .",
    "the hopping @xmath60 can lead to three different outcomes : either the hole hops back to site @xmath15 , removing the defect ; or it hops by another @xmath64 , creating a linear string of the type @xmath71 ; or it hops by one of the two @xmath72 , leading to a state such as the 3rd state shown in fig .

    "only states such as shown in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) are in our variational space , hence the unique @xmath77 term in the equation of @xmath78 . finally , the equation for @xmath77 is now connected to two possible 2-defect states .",
    "the hole could either hop back , linking to @xmath79 , or it could complete the closed loop by hopping to site @xmath15 and removing the defect that was there , resulting in @xmath80 eq .",
    "( [ m11x ] ) follows after a translation by @xmath81 , which maintains the site @xmath15 on the same original sublattice @xmath11 , since @xmath82 . of course , hopping also links @xmath77 to two generalized propagators @xmath83 with 4 defects , however those are ignored in this 3-defect variational space .",

    "( [ m13 ] ) describes a free particle on the @xmath11 sublattice , with an onsite energy @xmath95 , and hoppings @xmath96 and @xmath97 that correspond to nn and 2nd nn for sites on this sublattice .",
    "interestingly , all these effective quantities are functions of @xmath98 , in other words retardation effects are explicitly taken into consideration in this variational calculation .",
    "for @xmath99 we find that indeed @xmath100 , while @xmath101 .",
    "this is precisely twice the value we estimated for fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ; the factor of 2 is due to contributions from both clockwise and anticlockwise loops .     process generated with only 3-defect strings .",
    "[ fig2 ] ]    the appearance of the @xmath97 term at this level of the calculation is surprising at first , since configurations with 5 defects like that appearing in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) are not allowed in this variational space .",
    "the answer for how to achieve @xmath97 hopping with only 3-defect loops is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] : essentially , instead of removing the last defect at the 6th hopping , another 3-defect process is initiated .",
    "it is straightforward to check that in the perturbational limit , the ratio between the expected values for this @xmath97 and the @xmath96 of fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) is of @xmath102 .",
    "this is precisely the ground - state value of @xmath103 in this asymptotic limit , which further validates this statement .",
    "it is also now clear that this strategy of starting a new loop when only a single defect is left can be repeated an arbitrary number of times , and an infinite sequence of higher order contributions to @xmath96 and @xmath97 can be generated this way .",
    "this explains the @xmath104 denominators in eqs .",
    "( [ m14]),([m14b ] ) , showing that our variational calculation sums contributions from these 3-defect processes to all orders .    as argued previously ,",
    "the contribution of 5-defect loops is negligible if @xmath105 .",
    "interestingly , for such values @xmath106 varies from 0 to just above 1 ( however , this ignores the change in @xmath107 because the ground - state energy moves away from @xmath108 , as @xmath109 increases ) . in other words , the denominators in eqs .",
    "( [ m14 ] ) , ( [ m14b ] ) could become very small , implying that significant hopping , and thus light effective masses , may be possible in such systems even for rather small @xmath109 ratios .    as a final comment , the fact that @xmath37-dependence appears only in the equation for @xmath77 confirms that the effective hopping terms are due to completely circling around the closed loops . if we truncated the variational space to include only 2-defect states , which would mean setting @xmath110 in eq .",
    "( [ m10 ] ) , the result would be just a renormalization of the on - site energy but no dispersion .",
    "since the dispersion of the hole is due to trugman loops , it is interesting to consider what happens when a transverse magnetic field @xmath12 is applied . because of the large number of elementary hopping processes involved in generating effective longer ranged hoppings , one would expect the phases associated with these effective hoppings to be different from the normal peierls phase",
    ". put it another way , one would expect aharonov - bohm - like interference between clockwise and counterclockwise contributions , over and above the usual peierls phases , and therefore a spectrum that is not simply that of a bare particle with hoppings @xmath112 placed in a magnetic field .",
    "let @xmath113 be the magnetic flux through the elementary square plaquette . because the dressed hole only lives on one sublattice ( sublattice @xmath11 in our calculation ) , the actual relevant flux is @xmath114 , since the unit cell for the sublattice is doubled in size .    from elementary considerations of the hofstadter butterfly,@xcite we know that we need to consider the cases when the ratio between the magnetic flux and the elementary flux @xmath115 is @xmath116 , where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are mutually prime integers . in this case",
    ", we expect the spectrum to split into @xmath118 magnetic subbands .",
    "of course , then , the brillouin zone is folded down @xmath118 times .",
    "we are therefore interested in the spectrum of the dressed hole when @xmath119 ( for simplicity of notation , we also introduce @xmath120 ) .",
    "we use the landau gauge @xmath121 , in which case only the hopping integrals in the @xmath122-direction acquire peierls phases .",
    "the magnetic unit cell will contain @xmath123 sublattice @xmath11 sites , and it is drawn , together with the peierls phases , in fig .",
    "each site in the unit cell is labeled by the index @xmath124 which establishes its location in the unit cell , as well as the phase associated with hopping off this site in the positive @xmath122-direction .    , where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are mutually prime integers .",
    "the unit cell is marked by the red dashed line , and contains @xmath123 sites , labeled by squares , on the @xmath11 sublattice .",
    "these are indexed by their corresponding @xmath125 .",
    "the value of @xmath126 also appears in the peierls phases for hopping in the direction of the arrow .",
    "[ fig3 ] ]    the hamiltonian is identical to that of eq .",
    "( [ m1 ] ) , with the proper phases included in the hoppings .",
    "of course , we assume that the magnetic field is not sufficiently large to overcome the afm coupling and favor a fm ground state . also , we ignore the zeeman term  since the spins are reshuffled as the hole hops around , the total @xmath127-axis spin @xmath128 remains constant and therefore the zeeman contribution is an overall constant .",
    "we now need to introduce @xmath123 distinct plane waves , associated with each site of the unit cell @xmath129 where @xmath130 collects all sites on sublattice @xmath11 with the same value of @xmath126 .",

    "only the @xmath143 hopping accumulates a peierls phase , in this case , hence the cosine term appears only for that term .",
    "it follows that @xmath144 and @xmath145 are the effective parameters describing the new quasiparticle ( the dressed hole in the nel afm background plus magnetic field ) .",
    "they depend strongly on the magnetic field , besides the @xmath98-dependence due to retardation effects .",

    "in contrast , normally , ( i.e. for constant @xmath154 ) the spectrum is an even function of @xmath152 with period @xmath155 , because if the magnetic flux through the unit cell ( @xmath156 , in this case ) , increases by @xmath157 , the spectrum stays unchanged .",
    "thus , we expect a quite different - looking hofstadter butterfly for the dressed hole .",
    "in particular , since at least for small @xmath109 we expect @xmath158 , the spectrum should become extremely narrow every time @xmath159 because of destructive aharonov - bohm interference .",

    "the quasiparticle weight is fairly constant but with local variations that mimic the shape of the dispersion .",
    "this similarity is not surprising ; even though the edwards model allows more states ( e.g. with more defects at a site ) , those are higher in energy and do not contribute much to the gs .",

    "this suggests that the retardation effects may be somewhat stronger in this case : even though we know that only @xmath188 and @xmath189 effective hoppings are generated , these may not be well approximated by constant values @xmath190 if the @xmath98 dependence is considerable within the bandwidth of the dressed hole .",

    "this is not surprising , since longer loops with additional contributions to effective hoppings are included in the latter cases .",

    "( [ n3 ] ) , and solve it numerically for various values of @xmath207 .",
    "we show results for @xmath169 , even though we know that here the analytical calculation is not sufficient for full convergence , simply because its @xmath35 bandwidth is sufficiently large to make it easier to see the effect of a finite @xmath12 .",
    "we note that the numerical calculation in the variational spaces corresponding to various @xmath160 can be carried out as well , however each previous unknown , corresponding to an allowed configuration of defects , now becomes a @xmath208 matrix of unknowns , corresponding to each of the @xmath123 distinct sites in the magnetic brillouin zone shown in fig .",
    "this huge increase in the size of the linear system to be solved , especially for larger @xmath118 values ( smaller magnetic fields ) makes the implementation of this scheme cumbersome , and unnecessary since we do not expect any qualitative changes .        after solving the linear system in eq .",
    "( [ n3 ] ) , we calculate the local density of states ( ldos ) @xmath209 where the sum is over the ( highly folded ) magnetic brillouin zone corresponding to the magnetic unit cell of fig .",
    "this ldos is independent of the site @xmath125 used , hence the lack of a site index .",
    "we first consider the effect of the additional dependence on @xmath12 due to the aharonov - bohm interference , on the hofstadter butterfly expected when the magnetic flux through the unit cell is comparable to @xmath157 .",
    "results for various simple ratios are shown in fig .  [ fig10 ] .",
    "in all cases , the upper panel shows the full results , whereas the lower panel shows the results when the aharonov - bohm interference is turned off , i.e. we use the @xmath210 values @xmath211 , @xmath212 and @xmath213 in eq .",
    "( [ n3 ] ) .    for the @xmath35 case shown in ( a ) , the results are of course identical .",
    "the density of states resembles that of a 2d square lattice with nn hopping .",
    "this is expected , since the dominant hopping term is @xmath96 , which plays the role of nn hopping for the sublattice on which the dressed hole lives .",
    "the ldos is slightly distorted due to ( small ) contributions from the @xmath97 term and the retardation effects .",
    "these small distortions and asymmetries are observed in all other panels .    for a finite flux through the sublattice unit cell @xmath214 , the band splits into @xmath118 subbands , as expected in standard hofstadter butterfly phenomenology .",
    "the bands are not fully separated because we used a broadening @xmath215 which , while small , is still comparable with some of these features bandwidth . despite this , the various subbands are easily identifiable .    in figs .",
    "[ fig10 ]  ( b ) and  ( d ) , the full result ( top panel ) , while quite similar in aspect to the lower panel , shows a somewhat narrower bandwidth .",
    "this is not surprising , since the aharonov - bohm interference terms like @xmath216 etc .",
    "are responsible for a decrease in the value of the effective hoppings , and therefore of the overall bandwidth .",
    "this also explains the apparent `` collapse '' of the butterfly for @xmath217 and @xmath218 , shown in figs .",
    "[ fig10 ] ( c ) and ( e ) , respectively .",
    "the very narrow peak seen in both cases shows the expected subband structure , if a much smaller @xmath219 values is used , as done in the inset : the former case shows the 3 subbands ( these features are so narrow that even this much smaller @xmath220 can only partially resolve them ) , while the later case shows the one band .",
    "the extreme narrowing is due to the aharonov - bohm interference , which at these values of the flux results in a very small or vanishing @xmath221 , see eq .",
    "( [ n5 ] ) , and a bandwidth set by @xmath222 .",
    "as already noted , this additional @xmath12-dependent modulation of the hofstadter structure , coming from the aharonov - bohm interference , is also responsible for an increase in the periodicity of the butterfly .",
    "the lower panel shows that , as expected in models with constant hopping integrals , the butterfly is periodic if the flux through the unit cell increases by a flux quantum ( here , @xmath223 , or @xmath224 ) .",
    "the full result clearly does not have this periodicity . as discussed previously , based on eqs .",
    "( [ n4])([n6 ] ) we expect the periodicity to be @xmath225 for the full aharonov - bohm case ; our simulations confirm this ( not shown ) .",
    "we can imagine that this @xmath153 periodicity survives if one allows longer loops in the calculation , but some care is needed .",
    "for example , loops like those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) would bring in factors of @xmath226 in their contribution to @xmath96 , and various other aharonov - bohm phases will be associated with longer loops .",
    "we calculated several of these and all are consistent with the @xmath153 periodicity ; so we believe this @xmath153 period is correct to all orders , but do not have a proof .",
    "finally , we discuss the role of the aharonov - bohm interference at very small magnetic fields . in this case",
    ", one expects the spectrum to separate in a sequence of landau levels ( lls ) separated by the cyclotron frequency .",
    "the appearance of lls in the spectrum leads to quantum oscillations in various transport measurements , such as de haas - van alphen oscillations .",
    "ldos ; ( b ) the location of the lowest ll peak , in the full calculation ( squares ) and with the aharonov - bohm interference turned off ( circles ) .",
    "the dashed line is the analytical prediction of eq .",
    "( [ 27 ] ) .",
    "these results are for @xmath169 and @xmath227 . [ fig11 ] ]    the ldos at the lower edge , with ( full lines ) and without ( dashed line ) very small magnetic fields applied , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11](a ) .",
    "the @xmath35 ldos shows the jump at the band edge , here smoothed out by a finite @xmath220 value , and the roughly constant 2d density of states above it .",
    "the slight monotonic increase is due to the use of a tight - binding dispersion , as opposed to an approximate parabolic one.@xcite when the small field is turned on , we see that this ldos splits into equally spaced narrow peaks , marking the lls .",
    "the cyclotron frequency , defined by the distance between consecutive lls , increases roughly linearly with @xmath12 , and so does the weight in each lls , as expected because of its larger degeneracy .    in fig .",
    "[ fig11](b ) , we plot the energy of the lowest ll against the flux through the unit cell .",
    "squares show the full result , while circles are the result when the aharonov - bohm oscillations are turned off .",

    "this prediction is in excellent agreement with the results where the aharonov - bohm interference is turned off . in contrast , the full results show additional quadratic @xmath12-dependence .",
    "this is not so surprising , since for small magnetic fields , the effective hoppings depend quadratically on @xmath12 through the aharonov - bohm interference terms , and one would expect that dependence to be mirrored here through the effective mass .",
    "we do not perform a more quantitative analysis because , as already mentioned , the @xmath167 analytical case is not fully converged at this value of @xmath169 ; for example , the effective mass is @xmath231 , whereas the converged result is @xmath232  this is quite a sizable difference .",
    "going to a smaller @xmath109 is not easy either , because the bandwidth narrows ( or , equally , the effective mass increases ) and it becomes more and more difficult to separate various features .",
    "to conclude , we have investigated the motion of a hole in a 2d square ising afm .",
    "we showed that summation of the contribution of all trugman loops up to a given length @xmath160 can be carried out numerically , and convergence is reached for @xmath166 if @xmath233 .",
    "qualitatively correct and quantitatively quite reasonably accurate results are obtained from a simple analytical approximation for @xmath167 .",
    "we find that the effective mass of the hole can be fairly low , of around 30  40  @xmath196 , if @xmath234  3  5 .",
    "if a magnetic field is turned on , aharonov - bohm interference between clockwise and counterclockwise trugman loops leads to dependence of the effective hoppings on the magnetic field over and above the usual peierls phases .",
    "their most spectacular manifestation is in the `` collapse '' of the hofstadter butterfly structure at fields where the aharonov - bohm interference is destructive . of course , creating large enough magnetic fields to see the hofstadter butterfly band structure in a crystal is still a challenge ( moreover",
    ", one would need a large @xmath193 in order to prevent a transition to ferromagnet order , at such large fields ) .",
    "nevertheless , this is an interesting effect that might be mimicked in some other type of systems .    for small magnetic fields , where the magnetic length is large as compared to the unit cell , landau levels form .",
    "here , we find that the effect of the aharonov - bohm phases is to bring additional dependence on @xmath12 through @xmath235 , in the cyclotron frequency .",
    "this is a small effect , but one that might be easier to see through various quantum oscillations - type measurements .",
