    "one of the main motivations for a supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( sm ) is the fact that a calculation of the 1-loop corrections to the higgs boson mass yields a quadratic divergence arising from the sm particle loops . in a supersymmetric theory ,",
    "all particles in the sm are accompanied by their superpartners .",
    "therefore , all quadratic divergences are eliminated by the cancellation between ordinary particle and its superpartner loops .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) requires the existance of supermultiplets made up of fermions and bosons with equal masses .",
    "if susy is to be relevant for the physical world , it must be broken , either softly or spontaneously .",
    "that is , susy must broken because in experiment one does not observe degenerate bose - fermi multiplets .",
    "thus the higgs boson mass at the tree level receives quadratic corrections that are limited by an incomplete cancelation of the sm particle and its superpartner loops .    in the sm ,",
    "only one higgs doublet is required to give masses to the quarks and leptons .",
    "susy requires at least two higgs doublets .",
    "one is needed to give masses to the up - type quarks and the other to the down - type quarks and leptons .",
    "this is the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is the most widely studied supersymmetric extension of the sm .",
    "the physical mass spectra of the higgs bosons consist of two neutral scalars , one neutral pseudoscalar , and a pair of charged scalars .",
    "according to the tree level potential , the mass of the lightest scalar higgs boson have to be lighter than the z boson mass , and the the charged higgs boson mass must be heavier than the w boson mass .",
    "recently radiative corrections to the higgs boson masses have been calculated by many authors .",
    "the tree level constraints on the charged higgs boson mass can be violated when the top quark mass is heavy and the pseudoscalar higgs boson mass is light .",
    "this means that radiative corrections to the charged higgs boson mass can be negative contributions .",
    "however , these corrections to the tree level result are numerically very small [ 1,2 ] . on the other hand radiative corrections to the lightest scalar higgs boson mass",
    "give a significant contribution and the mass of the lightest scalar higgs boson can be substantially heavier than the z boson mass [ 3 - 5 ] .",
    "if one considers about more general extensions of the higgs sector [ 6 ] , the tree level results in the mssm can be changed .",
    "the simplest extension is the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) .",
    "the higgs sector in the nmssm consists of two higgs doublits @xmath0 and @xmath1 and a higgs singlet chiral superfield @xmath2 . in this model",
    ", the superpotential contains a new coupling among two higgs doublits and a higgs singlet .",
    "thus the parameter @xmath3 in the superpontial of the mssm can be generated dynamically by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the singlet higgs field [ 7 ] .",
    "the nmssm has ten real degrees of freedom .",
    "after the higgs mechanism takes place , three degrees of freedom correspond to neutral ( @xmath4 ) and charged ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) unphysical goldstone bosons , the other seven correspond to neutral ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) and charged ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) physical particles . here",
    "@xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are scalar higgs bosons while @xmath10 and @xmath11 are pseudoscalar higgs bosons . as a result ,",
    "the effective number of parameters describing the higgs sector at the tree level is six .",
    "as we have already mentioned above , the tree level result in the nmssm is a little different from that in the mssm .",
    "the mass of the charged higgs boson may be lighter or heavier than the w boson mass .",
    "also the upper bound on the lightest scalar higgs boson mass can be heavier than the z boson mass [ 8 ] .",
    "therefore the upper bound on the lightest scalar higgs boson mass of the nmssm at the tree level is heavier than that of the mssm .",
    "furthermore radiative corrections to the lightest scalar higgs boson mass lead to a important contributions .",
    "it is well known that the largest contribution to the lightest scalar higgs boson mass comes from the top quark and scalar quark loops [ 9 ] .",
    "these effects are quite substantial when the top scalar quark mass is much heavier than the top quark mass .",
    "this implies that at least one top scalar quark mass is heavier than top quark mass .",
    "if the top quark and scalar quark masses are identical , the contribution of radiative corrections to the lightest scalar higgs boson mass vanishes .    assuming the degeneracy of the left- and right - handed top scalar quarks , radiative corrections to the lightest scalar higgs boson mass",
    "are studied in ref .",
    "[ 10,11 ] . especially , the authers of ref .",

    "the main aim of this paper is to explore all the parameter space and provide an accurate numerical evaluation for the upper bound on the lightest scalar higgs boson mass in the nmssm .",
    "we examine in detail the radiative corrections to the lightest scalar higgs boson mass using the 1-loop effective potential . in general , the contribution of radiative corrections due to the bottom quark and scalar quark loops to the tree level mass of the lightest scalar higgs boson is very small numerically .",
    "therefore we use the effective potential which includes the contribution of the top quark and scalar quark loops assuming the nondegenerate of the top scalar quark masses .",
    "thus the mass splitting among the top scalar quark give a significant effect to the upper bound of the lightest scalar higgs boson mass .",
    "in fact , there have been many studies about the upper bound on the lightest scalar higgs boson mass including radiative corrections in the nmssm .",
    "unlike their calculations we especially use the top scalar quark mass matrix containing the gauge terms in the 1-loop effective potential .",
    "therefore our formalism for the scalar higgs boson mass matrix at the 1-loop level contains the contributions of the gauge sector . after including radiative corrections ,",
    "the upper bound on the lightest scalar higgs boson mass becomes dependent on @xmath16 , and @xmath14 as free parameters as well as the parameters at the tree level .",

    "again we conject that @xmath44 have a maximum value in a value between @xmath61 = 2 and 10 .",
    "6 shows that the upper bounds on @xmath44 at the tree level and 1-loop level , as a function of @xmath61 , for @xmath14 = 175 gev , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , 100 gev @xmath95 1000 gev , and 0 gev @xmath96 3000 gev .",
    "the absolute upper bound on @xmath44 at the tree level and 1-loop level are 101 and 156 gev for @xmath97 2.7 , respectively .",
    "in order to devise effective search strategies for the detection of higgs particle , the study for the lightest scalar higgs boson mass is very important .",
    "particularly , supersymmetric models impose strong constraints on the lightest higgs boson mass . in the nmssm",
    "the upper bound on @xmath44 at the tree level is about 130 gev for all the parameter space . by the renormalization group analysis",
    "the improved upper bound on @xmath44 is about 101 gev for @xmath98 175 gev .    we know from the previous papers that the top quark and scalar quark loops have a positive effect on the lightest higgs boson mass when radiative corrections to the higgs sector of the tree level are considered .",
    "but authors of the papers calculated the lightest scalar higgs boson mass with some approximations . here",
    "we examine in detail radiative corrections to the lightest higgs boson mass without some approximations .",
    "the input parameters at the 1-loop level as well as at the tree level are varied independently .",
    "we find from fig.1 that @xmath87 play an important role in the mass splitting among the top scalar quark . here the value of @xmath87 is allowed to vary from 0 gev to 3000 gev .",
    "the free parameters , @xmath25 , @xmath24 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath32 are limited as masses below 1000 gev . in this case , the upper limits on the top scalar quark masses for @xmath14 = 175 gev are approximately given by @xmath99 1000 gev .",
    "we are investigated the dependence of the lightest scalar higgs boson mass on all input parameters .",
    "we calculated radiative corrections to the lightest higgs boson mass using the 1-loop effective potential in the nmssm . here",
    "we consider the contribution of the top quark and scalar quark loops for the effective potential .",
    "we take the mass matrix of the top scalar quark including the gauge term .",
    "furthermore the mass matrix of the top scalar quark are given as the nongenerate state .",
    "additionally we assume that the lower limits on the top scalar quark masses are greater than the top quark mass .",
    "thus radiative correctons to the lightest higgs boson mass contain the effect of the mass spliting among the top scalar quark and the contribution of the gauge sector .",
    "an analytic formula for the scalar higgs boson mass matrix including these effects are derived .",
    "the upper bound on @xmath44 containing these effects is calculated by our formula .",
    "we find from fig .",
    "5 that the upper bound on @xmath44 have a maximum value as @xmath87 approach a particular value . but the value of @xmath87 can not exceed 3000 gev when the upper bound on @xmath44 is maximised .",
    "in other to find the absolute upper bound as a function of @xmath61 including radiative corrections , we maximized over the parameter space using numerical analysis .",
    "the result of our calculation are presented in fig .",
    "we also find from fig . 6 that there exists the absolute upper bound on @xmath44 of about 156 gev .",
