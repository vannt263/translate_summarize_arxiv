    "spectral functions of current - current correlators are interesting objects in hadron physics .",
    "they are sensitive to both low and high energy dynamics of qcd , which can be evaluated in two reliable approaches : chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath6pt ) @xcite in the low - energy region and the operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite for the higher one .",
    "the celebrated weinberg sum rules are in fact derived by studying the differences of the vector - vector and axial - vector - axial - vector spectral functions  @xcite , where not only the low and asymptotic energy regions but also the resonance region are considered .",
    "after then , great progresses , both on the experimental and theoretical sides  @xcite , have been made along this research line .",
    "the vector and axial - vector spectral functions are experimentally measurable quantities , mainly through the @xmath7 decays , due to the noticeable @xmath8 nature of the standard model in the energy region well below the @xmath9 boson mass .",
    "concerning the scalar and pseudoscalar spectral functions , there are no direct experimental data .",
    "however , great efforts have been made on the theoretical sides both in perturbative qcd calculations  @xcite , which are important to reduce the qcd background in the search of the higgs particle , and in the nonperturbative qcd region  @xcite . through the matching between the low and high energy behaviors of the spectral functions ,",
    "valuable information can be obtained : light quark masses and cabibbo angle @xmath10  @xcite , determination of the low energy constants ( lecs ) in @xmath6pt  @xcite and constraints on resonance parameters  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in the past decade scalar dynamics in the nonperturbative qcd region has been greatly put forward thanks to the combination of @xmath6pt and nonperturbative approaches from the @xmath11-matrix theory  @xcite .",
    "one of the main results is the reappearance of the broad @xmath12 ( traditionally called @xmath13 ) , the lightest resonance in qcd spectrum , after its long absence in the pdg list  @xcite .",
    "later on the @xmath14 or @xmath15 resonance in @xmath16 scattering was also confirmed  @xcite .",
    "though the mass and width of these broad scalar resonances predicted by different groups are rather consistent among each other , other properties about the resonances in the scalar family are still under a vivid debate ( e.g. their nature ) .",
    "the scalar - scalar ( @xmath1 ) and pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar ( @xmath2 ) correlation functions provide us another theoretical tool to further study the scalar resonances  @xcite , once the phase shifts and inelasticities in meson - meson scattering are well reproduced @xcite . as derived in refs .",
    "@xcite these correlator functions should fulfill a set of spectral - function sum rules that imply tight constraints to the scalar and pseudoscalar spectra , involving nontrivial relations between them .",
    "we take , and further study , the meson - meson scattering amplitudes of ref .",
    "@xcite that are calculated in one - loop @xmath0 @xmath6pt plus the explicit scalar and vector resonance exchanges at tree level within the framework of resonance chiral theory ( r@xmath6 t )  @xcite . as a novelty , we include the contributions from the tree level exchange of pseudoscalar resonances in this work so that a new fit to data is also discussed .",
    "the unitarized @xmath0 @xmath6pt amplitudes are more appropriate to incorporate the heavier @xmath17 scalar resonances since the channels involving the @xmath18 and @xmath19 mesons can be taken into account ( while @xmath20 @xmath6pt  @xcite only contains the pure octet @xmath21 field ) . as noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite , further developed later in refs .",
    "@xcite , the study of the resonance pole trajectories with increasing number of colors of qcd , @xmath3 , is of interest to discern possible natures of the scalar resonances . e.g. a @xmath22 resonance evolves with a mass @xmath23 , while its width decreases as @xmath24 . for the case of a glueball",
    "its mass behaves also as @xmath25 with a width that decreases faster with @xmath3 as @xmath26 @xcite . in this respect",
    "@xmath0 @xmath6pt is also more adequate than the @xmath20 version to discuss the large @xmath3 limit because @xmath0 @xmath6pt includes not only the pseudo - goldstone octet , as @xmath20 does , but also the singlet @xmath27 that in the chiral limit is the ninth goldstone boson at large @xmath3  @xcite . in this way , @xmath0 @xmath6pt has the appropriate low energy degrees of freedom in the chiral limit at large @xmath3 . additionally , as stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath18 meson quickly becomes much lighter with increasing @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this fact has a strong impact on the dependence with @xmath3 of the pole trajectories of the scalar resonances , except for the @xmath12 , because of its weak couplings to the channels with @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "we show below the @xmath3 pole trajectories for the different resonances involved in our study from the new fit to data .",
    "another interesting property of strong interactions that can be used to restrict meson - meson scattering is average or semilocal duality @xcite .",
    "it allows one to relate the crossed channel dynamics with the @xmath28-channel one , which supplies another stringent constraint on the resonance properties involved in scattering . in a recent work  @xcite , pelez _ et al",
    "_ have investigated how semilocal duality between the light resonances of qcd and regge theory can be satisfied in @xmath29 scattering .",
    "these authors employ the inverse amplitude method ( iam ) @xcite to unitarize the @xmath20 one - loop and @xmath30 two - loop @xmath6pt amplitudes .",
    "the main conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite is that in the physical case , i.e. when @xmath31 , the @xmath12 resonance , with its pole position around @xmath32  mev , plays a crucial role to oppose the vector strength from the @xmath33 resonance , which guarantees the fulfillment of semilocal duality .",
    "having introduced the main research topics considered here for the sake of clarity we summarize our work and briefly comment on the main points and results obtained by considering these topics .",
    "a complete one - loop calculation of the scalar and pseudoscalar form factors within @xmath0 unitary @xmath6pt , including the tree - level exchange of scalar , pseudoscalar and vector resonances , is undertaken .",
    "the spectral functions of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 two - point correlators are constructed by using the resulting scalar and pseudoscalar form factors , respectively , which are unitarized for the case of the scalar ones .",
    "after updating the fit in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is also extended by including the explicit exchange of pseudoscalar resonances , we study the resonance spectroscopy , quadratic pion scalar radius , the fulfillment of semilocal duality and the spectral function sum rules in the @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 cases , which are remarkably well satisfied simultaneously .",
    "we show that it is important to take under consideration the high energy constraint for the coupling of the vector resonances to pseudo - goldstone bosons , in order to keep semilocal duality when varying @xmath3 .",
    "an interesting interplay between different resonances when studying the @xmath3 evolution of semilocal duality and the spectral function sum rules is revealed . in the former case",
    "the scalar and vector spectra appear tightly related and in the latter one the same can be stated for the scalar and pseudoscalar ones .",
    "this issue is closely connected with the evolution of the resonance pole position with varying @xmath3 of the pseudoscalar , vector and scalar resonances .    in this respect , for larger @xmath3 , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite revealed that a @xmath22 subdominant component for the @xmath12 , with a mass around 1 gev and obtained for some sets of lecs in both one - loop and two - loop calculations , is needed in order to fulfill semilocal duality .",
    "for those solutions , the @xmath12 pole moves away from the 400 - 700  mev region of the real axis , but it turns around moving back towards the real axis above 1 gev as @xmath3 becomes larger than 8 or so .",
    "the interpretation of these results was studied preliminarily in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath12 is considered as a combination of several states and it was found that the weight of the subdominant @xmath37 component in the @xmath12 grows with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "immediately , one can ask a question : apart from the @xmath12 resonance , which is only marginally contributed by this @xmath22 component , are there any other more obvious effects from the @xmath22 seed at @xmath31 ?",
    "if there are , what kind of role do these effects play in the fulfillment of semilocal duality ?    concerning the first question , we provide here , confirming refs .",
    "@xcite , a scenario for an affirmative answer .",
    "a bare singlet scalar resonance @xmath38 , with its bare mass around 1 gev , is found significant @xcite to reproduce the @xmath29 and @xmath39 scattering data around the @xmath40 energy region and , thus , becomes an important part of the @xmath40 resonance in the physical case , i.e. at @xmath31 .",
    "when increasing @xmath3 , the physical @xmath40 resonance , gradually evolves to the singlet @xmath38 , which acts like the role of the @xmath22 seed described in refs .",
    "apparently , the scenario that we provide now is different from that in ref .",
    "@xcite , since in the latter reference the signal of the @xmath40 resonance gradually disappears when increasing @xmath3",
    ". finally disappears with larger values of @xmath3 .",
    "] regarding the second question raised in the previous paragraph we find here that its role for fulfilling the requirements of semilocal duality becomes more important with increasing @xmath3 , being only of little importance at @xmath31 .",
    "this behavior is in qualitative agreement with the results of @xcite .",
    "in addition to the results presented in our short letter  @xcite , we show our theoretical calculations in detail and discuss more phenomenological materials in this work , such as the fit results , resonance pole positions and their coupling strengths , @xmath3 trajectories for all the relevant resonances and so on .",
    "the contents of this article are organized as follows .",
    "section [ sect.chirallag ] is devoted to the introduction of the relevant chiral lagrangian . in sections",
    "[ sect.specfandff ] and [ sect.semilocalintro ] , we present the details of the calculations of the spectral functions and the quantities to measure the degree of fulfillment of semilocal duality , respectively .",

    "section [ sect.ncrunning ] is then devoted to the study of the @xmath3 evolution of these quantities .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ sect.conclusion ] .",

    "the @xmath41 chiral symmetry in @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath28 massless qcd is broken because of quantum effects that violate the conservation of the singlet axial - vector current by the @xmath44 anomaly @xcite . as a result",
    "the pseudoscalar @xmath19 is not a pseudo - goldstone boson @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , from the large @xmath3 qcd point of view the quark loop responsible for the @xmath44 anomaly @xcite is @xmath5 suppressed . in this way",
    ", the @xmath19 becomes the ninth pseudo - goldstone boson in the large @xmath3 limit  @xcite .",
    "in large @xmath3 qcd the singlet field @xmath27 can be conveniently incorporated into the effective field theory by enlarging the number of degrees of freedom of the theory from an octet to a nonet of pseudo - goldstone bosons , which is usually called @xmath0 @xmath6pt @xcite . in this theory",
    "there are three expansion parameters : momentum , quark masses and @xmath5 , giving rise to a joint triple expansion @xmath45 .",
    "we briefly recapitulate the relevant chiral lagrangians for our work .",
    "the leading order lagrangian in @xmath0 @xmath6pt reads @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 stands for the trace in flavor space and the last operator is the @xmath44 anomaly term that gives rise to the singlet @xmath27 mass .",

    "we do not consider isospin ( @xmath54 ) breaking effects throughout .    in the present work ,",
    "we exploit the assumption on the resonance saturation of the lecs @xcite , so that , instead of local chiral terms contributing to meson - meson scattering , we take the tree level exchanges of the scalar , pseudoscalar and vector resonances . in this way",
    "we keep all local contributions to meson - meson scattering up to and including @xmath55 , while also generating higher order ones .",
    "we also include the one - loop contributions that count one order higher in @xmath56 , as calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the terms that describe the interactions between scalar resonances and pseudo - goldstone bosons in r@xmath6 t are   were also introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite but found phenomenologically irrelevant .",

    "one should notice that the operators appearing in eq .",
    "cause mixing terms proportional to the quark masses between the pseudoscalar resonances and the pseudo - goldstone bosons .",
    "though it is not a problem to consider this effect in the calculation of feynman diagrams , it would be convenient to eliminate the mixing terms at the lagrangian level .",
    "indeed this can be accomplished by performing the following field redefinition in a chiral covariant way : @xmath64 with @xmath65 the unit @xmath66 matrix .",
    "substituting eq .   into eqs .   and , we have the new lagrangian @xmath67 where the omitted terms , represented by the dots in the last line , denote the local chiral operators that describe the interactions between the pseudo - goldstone bosons at @xmath68 that we disregard throughout .",
    "we point out that the above procedure only eliminates the mixing terms between the pseudoscalar resonances and pseudo - goldstone bosons that are linearly proportional to quark masses .",
    "the new mixing terms with higher power of quark masses that arise through the operators in the second line of eq .",
    "are @xmath68 contributions , which are then not considered in this work .",
    "it is interesting to point out that after the field redefinition of eq .",
    ", two new operators describing interactions between pseudo - goldstone bosons appear , i.e. the ones in the third line of eq .  .",
    "they coincide with the @xmath69 terms that result from the integration of the pseudoscalar resonances @xcite .",
    "we remind that the nature of the pseudoscalar resonances is still a somewhat debated issue and also that typically the parameters of those resonances are not determined accurately  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the pseudoscalar resonances are generated dynamically due to the interactions between the scalar resonances and the pseudo - goldstone bosons , instead of introducing them as basic degrees of freedom at the lagrangian level . in order to compensate for the uncertainties arising from the not well settled properties of the pseudoscalar resonances , as well as from the simple tree level exchanges with bare propagators that we take here to describe them ( neglecting more involved contributions as those pointed out in ref .",

    "nevertheless the @xmath72 term vanishes if one further imposes the large @xmath3 relations for the pseudoscalar resonances ( as we take here ) @xmath74 we stress that @xmath75 is different from @xmath70 in the @xmath6pt lagrangian  @xcite and their relation can be written as @xmath76 so that we interpret @xmath75 as the contributions from some remnant pieces that are sub - leading in @xmath5 , minding that the leading @xmath3 contributions are already included in the resonance part .",
    "finally , there are two relevant terms at @xmath77 that only incorporate pseudo - goldstone bosons @xcite and can not be generated from the exchange of the explicit resonance fields discussed above .",
