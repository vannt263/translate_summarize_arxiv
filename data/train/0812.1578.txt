    "the progenitors of planetary nebulae ( pne ) , asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , have atmospheres particularly favorable for grain formation , and are considered the most efficient source of circumstellar dust ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . however , it is not clear yet how much dust do pne have and whether this dust is destroyed or modified during their lifetime . @xcite and",
    "@xcite studied pne with _ iras _ data and found that their derived dust - to - gas mass ratios decreased with nebular radius ( which they used as a proxy for nebular age ) .",
    "however , these results strongly depend on the poorly known distances to the studied pne , and were called into question by @xcite , who derived dust - to - gas ratios using distance - independent quantities and found no correlation with the surface brightness in h@xmath1 , their proxy for nebular age .",
    "@xcite concluded that there is no evidence for a decrease in the dust - to - gas mass ratio as pne evolve , but since there are many uncertainties involved , the issue is far from being settled .",
    "as an alternative to dust - to - gas mass ratios derived from infrared emission , one might consider studying dust through element depletions .",
    "elements such as al , ca , si , ni and fe have abundances in the interstellar medium ( ism ) much lower than solar @xcite , and this is generally interpreted as due to their depletion in dust grains .",
    "the differences in depletion factors found in different environments give important clues on the nature of the formation and destruction mechanisms for dust grains in the ism ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the depletion factors in pne can provide clues on the mechanisms that operate in ionized gas . to study the sensitivity of depletions to environment one must choose an element that is mostly condensed into dust grains , like those mentioned above , since in that case the destruction of a small quantity of dust will translate into a measurable increase of the element abundance in the gas . however , the abundances of these elements are usually difficult to measure in ionized gas due to the lack of suitable emission lines or atomic data , and due to the highly uncertain corrections for unobserved ions . these problems , combined with the wide spread in the degrees of ionization , and hence of ionization states , found in pne , imply that the depletion factors derived so far for pne use different ions and ionization correction factors ( icfs ) and are not only uncertain , but also difficult to compare between them .",
    "the published values for the abundances of refractory elements in pne cover the ranges : 1/61/300 the solar abundance for ca , 1/21/350 for al , 1/31/300 for fe , near solar to 1/10 solar for mg , and near solar to 1/20 solar for si @xcite .    the problem with the determination of depletion factors in ionized gas is somewhat alleviated in the case of regions , where the range of degrees of ionization is much smaller .",
    "however , dust grains in pne and regions are likely to have very different characteristics .",
    "the dust grains present in pne formed in the cool atmospheres of the progenitor stars , whereas those grains now present in regions were located before in the associated molecular clouds and can be considered processed interstellar dust grains .",
    "therefore , it is important to perform a homogeneous study of depletion factors in a sample of pne , and especially so if the results can also be compared with those found in regions .",
    "differences in depletion factors can provide much information on the efficiency of dust formation and destruction processes .",
    "of all the refractory elements we mentioned above , fe has the strongest lines in the visible range of the spectrum .",
    "furthermore , since most of the fe atoms are condensed into dust grains and since the cosmic abundance of fe is relatively high , this element is an important contributor to the mass of refractory dust grains @xcite , and the fe gaseous abundance will probably reflect the abundance of refractory elements in dust .",
    "these reasons make fe a good choice to study depletion factors in ionized gas",
    ".    the comparison between the results derived in pne and regions will be more meaningful if the sample of pne is restricted to objects with a low degree of ionization , because in that case the same ions need to be considered in the abundance determination for both types of objects . in regions ,",
    "fe will be mostly found in three ionization states : fe@xmath2 , fe@xmath3 , and fe@xmath4 .",
    "fe@xmath2 has a low ionization potential and its contribution to the total abundance is often negligible @xcite . on the other hand , [ ]",
    "lines are weak and more difficult to measure than [ ] lines .",
    "hence , fe abundances are usually calculated from fe@xmath3 abundances and an icf derived from photoionization models . however , for the handful of objects in which [ ] lines have been measured , this icf can be compared with that implied by the derived fe@xmath4 abundances , and a discrepancy has been found between them ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite determined what changes in all the atomic data involved in the calculations would explain this discrepancy : ( 1 ) a decrease in the collision strengths for fe@xmath4 by factors of 23 , ( 2 ) an increase in the collision strengths for fe@xmath3 by factors of 23 , or ( 3 ) an increase in the total recombination coefficient or the rate of the charge - exchange reaction with h@xmath5 for fe@xmath4 by a factor of @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite argued that the three explanations are equally plausible , and derived two different icfs : @xmath7 @xmath8 equation  ( [ eq1 ] ) is based on photoionization models that use the state - of - the - art values for the atomic data relevant to the problem , and equation  ( [ eq2 ] ) is derived from those objects with measurements of [ ] lines ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eq2 ] ) should be replaced by @xmath9 for those objects with @xmath10 , since @xmath11 and @xmath12 will then dominate the total abundances of fe and o. if the discrepancy were completely due to errors in the collision strengths for fe@xmath4 , good values of the fe abundance could be obtained from the icf of equation  ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "if the collision strengths for fe@xmath3 were the ones to blame , the correct abundance would be the previous value lowered by @xmath13  dex .",
    "finally , if the models predictions were wrong  due to errors in the total recombination coefficient or the rate of the charge - exchange reaction  the icf of equation  ( [ eq2 ] ) would give the best values of the fe abundance .",
    "the discrepancy is probably due to some combination of the aforementioned causes , therefore the errors required in any of the atomic data are likely to be lower than those considered above , and the values of the fe abundance will consequently be intermediate between the extreme values obtained with the icf scheme described above .",
    "the three ionization correction schemes give values of the fe abundance that can be similar or differ by more than a factor of 10 , but since these schemes involve drastic changes in the atomic data involved in the abundance calculation , the extreme values of the fe abundance implied by them can be used to constrain the true values of the fe abundances in the gas .",
    "@xcite followed this procedure and found that the two galactic regions and the four galactic pne of their sample have less than 5% of their fe atoms in the gas phase . in this paper",
    ", we apply this procedure to constrain the fe abundances in a sample of 33 low - ionization galactic pne , and compare the results with the values obtained for 10 galactic regions .",
    "in order to perform the analysis described above , we need to select a sample of low - ionization pne where fe@xmath2 , fe@xmath3 , and fe@xmath4 ( the latter with ionization potential ip = 54.8 ev ) are the main ionization states of iron and o@xmath2 , o@xmath3 ( the latter with ip = 54.9 ev ) are the main ionization states of oxygen .",
    "we considered a group of pne that have determinations of the o@xmath4 abundance @xcite , and found that those with @xmath14 have less than 10% of their o abundance in this ionization state .",
    "hence , we established this as the condition that our sample pne should satisfy .",
    "the initial sample consists of 28 low - ionization pne , 23 of them selected from the literature because their published spectra have all the lines we need to calculate physical conditions and the fe@xmath3 and o ionic abundances .",
    "three of these pne do not have measurements of [ ] lines , but do have measurements of weak , nearby recombination lines which can be used to calculate upper limits to the fe@xmath3 and fe abundances .",
    "the other 5 pne of the sample were observed in the 2.1-m telescope at observatorio astronmico nacional ( san pedro mrtir , mexico ) .    our initial sample does not contain pne with high electron densities ( @xmath15 ) because it is difficult to obtain good estimates of the physical conditions in these objects .",
    "however , we have included 5 additional pne with @xmath16  @xmath17 , and performed a special analysis , as described in section 6 .",
    "long - slit spectra covering the wavelength ranges @xmath1836005700 and @xmath1853507500 were obtained with the boller & chivens spectrograph and the site3 ccd detector in the 2.1-m telescope at observatorio astronmico nacional ( san pedro mrtir , mexico ) .",
    "the spectral ranges were covered with a spectral resolution of @xmath19   using a 600 lines @xmath20 grating at two different angles , and a slit width of 2 .",
    "the observed objects , the positions and position angles ( p.a . ) of the slit , and the exposure times are listed in table  [ tabla_1 ] .",
    "the slit was positioned at the center of the nebulae with the exception of jner  1 , where the slit was placed at the nw condensation .",
    "bias frames , twilight and tungsten flat - field exposures , wavelength calibrations , and exposures of standard stars were taken each night .",
    "the angular diameters of ic  4593 , ngc  2392 , and ngc  6210 are smaller than the slit length and suitable sky windows could be selected on either side of the nebular emission .",
    "for ngc  3587 and jner  1 , sky spectra were obtained near the objects after the nebular exposures .",
    "the spectra were reduced using the iraf reduction package and following the standard procedures for long - slit reductions .",
    "after the bias subtraction , flat - field correction , and wavelength calibration , the images were flux calibrated with the standard stars feige  34 , feige  56 and g191b2b .",
    "we subtracted the sky ( after scaling it by factors of 0.51.5 to obtain the best cancelation in those cases where the sky spectra were observed separately ) , and removed cosmic rays by the combination of different exposures .",
    "finally , one - dimensional spectra were extracted .",
