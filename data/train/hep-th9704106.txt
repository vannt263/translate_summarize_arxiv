    "solving qcd is among the most challenging problems in theoretical physics .",
    "a non - perturbative formulation of qcd is provided by wilson s lattice gauge theory @xcite , which maps the problem to one of classical statistical mechanics . over the past twenty years a variety of tools",
    "have been developed to solve lattice field theories . at present",
    "the most powerful tool is the monte carlo simulation of the partition function of the corresponding classical statistical mechanics system .",
    "however , the most efficient numerical algorithms for solving lattice qcd suffer from critical slowing down when the continuum limit is approached and thus exhaust even the biggest supercomputers . the use of improved or even `` perfect '' actions may alleviate this problem @xcite , because it may allow one to extract continuum physics from rather coarse lattices . on the other hand , to obtain high - precision numerical data using the standard numerical techniques will still require large resources of computer power .",
    "hence , it is certainly reasonable to look for new formulations of the qcd problem .",
    "here we propose an alternative non - perturbative approach to qcd in the framework of quantum link models .",
    "such models were first discussed by horn @xcite , and studied in more detail by orland and rohrlich @xcite . in these models the classical statistical mechanics problem of standard lattice gauge theory is replaced by a problem of quantum statistical mechanics . in particular , the classical euclidean action is replaced by a hamilton operator . as a consequence , the elements of the link matrices that are ordinary c - numbers in the standard formulation of lattice gauge theory , turn into non - commuting operators acting in a hilbert space .",
    "recently , quantum link models have been formulated with a fifth euclidean direction and it has been shown how they are related to ordinary 4-d yang - mills theories via dimensional reduction @xcite . the previous work on quantum link models",
    "was limited to @xmath0 and @xmath1 gauge groups and it was not clear how to generalize the construction to @xmath2 .",
    "the quantum link models constructed in this paper have an @xmath2 gauge symmetry and provide a new non - perturbative formulation of qcd .",
    "we hope that this formulation will lead to alternative ways for attacking this long - standing problem , both with analytic and with numerical methods .",
    "quantum link qcd is quite different from the standard formulation of lattice qcd .",
    "the main novel feature of quantum link models is that the gluonic hilbert space on each link is finite .",
    "while the hilbert space in the hamiltonian formulation of standard lattice qcd contains all representations of @xmath3 on a link , the corresponding hilbert space of an @xmath2 quantum link model consists of a single representation of @xmath4 .",
    "this is achieved by formulating the theory in @xmath5 dimensions . in order to represent full qcd , of course",
    ", quarks must also be included . even in the standard formulation of lattice gauge theory ,",
    "the hilbert space of the quarks is finite and indeed the representation of quarks in quantum link qcd is not very different .",
    "however , the boundary conditions of the quarks in the fifth euclidean direction must be carefully adjusted in order to ensure their proper dimensional reduction .",
    "antiperiodic boundary conditions do not work , because they do not lead to a long enough fermionic correlation length in four dimensions .",
    "periodic boundary conditions , on the other hand , allow an arbitrarily long 4-d fermionic correlation length .",
    "the resulting 4-d fermion resembles in many respects the standard lattice wilson fermion .",
    "in particular , with periodic boundary conditions for the quarks in the fifth direction , quantum link qcd suffers from a fine - tuning problem , when one wants to approach the chiral limit .",
    "fortunately , we can do better than that .",
    "kaplan proposed to represent 4-d chiral fermions by working with a domain wall in a five - dimensional world @xcite . in his construction",
    "the fifth dimension arises for completely different reasons than in quantum link models .",
    "however , since we already have five dimensions , it is natural to use them also to protect the chiral symmetries of the fermions .",
    "the scheme that fits most naturally with quantum link models is shamir s variant @xcite of kaplan s proposal , which works with a 5-d slab ( which is finite in the fifth direction ) with open boundary conditions for the fermions at the two boundaries . due to the boundary conditions ,",
    "a left - handed fermion is bound to one side of the slab , while a right - handed fermion appears on the opposite side .",
    "remarkably , the correlation length of these fermions is exponentially large in the depth of the slab .",
    "this is exactly what one needs for them to survive the dimensional reduction in quantum link models .",
    "the corresponding geometry is shown in fig.1 .",
    "when shamir s boundary conditions are used for the quarks in quantum link qcd , no fine - tuning is necessary to approach the chiral limit of the theory .",
    "this is essential , because recovering the chiral properties of the quarks is one of the main problems in numerical simulations of wilson fermions .",
    "recently , using the standard formulation of lattice gauge theory , it was demonstrated convincingly that shamir s proposal is indeed practical from a computational point of view @xcite and that it leads to a great improvement of the chiral properties of quarks on the lattice .",
    "it is reassuring that the formulation of quantum link models in five dimensions fits naturally with this elegant solution of the fermion doubling problem in vector - like theories including qcd .",
    "should similar ideas ultimately lead to a lattice construction of chiral gauge theories , one may expect that the theory can also be formulated as a quantum link model .",
    "once the lattice chiral fermion problem is solved , the door may be open to a non - perturbative lattice formulation of supersymmetry . in that case",
    "quantum link models may offer the most natural framework , because they treat the hilbert spaces of bosons and fermions on an equal footing .",
    "in particular , in quantum link models the bosonic hilbert space is also finite ( on a finite lattice ) .",
    "due to the fact that the gluonic hilbert space of quantum link qcd is finite , one can reformulate the theory in terms of fermionic constituents of the gluons , which we call rishons following jewish tradition @xcite .",
    "the rishons carry color and transform in the fundamental representation of @xmath2 .",
    "each quantum link variable can be expressed as a rishon - anti - rishon pair .",
    "the rishon dynamics is particularly simple .",
    "the hamilton operator describes the hopping of rishons from one end of a link to the other , as illustrated in fig.2 .",
    "the rishon formulation of quantum link qcd resembles the schwinger boson and constraint fermion constructions of quantum spin systems @xcite and provides theoretical insight , that may lead to new analytic approaches to qcd , for example , in the large @xmath6 limit .",
    "the hamilton operator of quantum link qcd with a @xmath0 gauge group can also be expressed in terms of glueball , meson and constituent quark operators .",
    "these objects consist of two rishons , two quarks and a quark - rishon pair , respectively .",
    "it is conceivable that the theory can be bosonized in terms of these degrees of freedom .",
    "if large @xmath6 techniques can be applied successfully , major progress in the non - perturbative solution of qcd and other interesting field theories is to be expected .",
    "it is intriguing that @xmath0 quantum link qcd has two representations  one exclusively in terms of color - triplet quark and rishon fermions , the other in terms of color - singlet bosons .",
    "in contrast to standard lattice gauge theories , the configuration space of quantum link models is discrete and their path integral representation resembles that of quantum spin models .",
    "hence , it seems plausible that highly efficient cluster algorithms similar to those for quantum spins @xcite become available for quantum link models . for classical spin models the development of cluster algorithms @xcite gave rise to a tremendous improvement of numerical data and",
    "has led to a satisfactory high - precision numerical solution of various models . despite many attempts , it has so far not been possible to construct efficient cluster algorithms in the standard formulation of lattice qcd .",
    "the 2-d classical o(3 ) model is in many respects similar to 4-d yang - mills theories .",
    "the most efficient way to simulate the @xmath7 model is provided by the wolff cluster algorithm @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the same model can also be obtained from the 2-d antiferromagnetic quantum heisenberg model via dimensional reduction @xcite . for the heisenberg model",
    "a very efficient loop cluster algorithm is available @xcite , which has recently been modified to work directly in the euclidean time continuum @xcite .",
    "this algorithm has been used to simulate the correlation length of the 2-d classical o(3 ) model that results from dimensional reduction @xcite .",
    "the quality of the numerical data is compatible with those obtained from the wolff algorithm applied directly to the 2-d classical model . for example",
    ", using a finite size scaling technique , correlation lengths of up to about 37000 lattice spacings could be handled successfully .",
    "this suggests that , if a cluster algorithm can be constructed for quantum link qcd , its numerical simulation should be more efficient than that of standard lattice qcd , for which no cluster algorithm has been found .",
    "at present , it is unclear if superior numerical methods can be developed in the quantum link formulation of lattice qcd .",
    "however , this seems possible , because , for example , for a @xmath8 quantum link model a cluster algorithm operating in the continuum of the fifth euclidean direction has already been constructed @xcite .",
    "quantum link models with quarks resemble standard models of quantum statistical mechanics , as , for example , the hubbard model .",
    "this may eventually lead to problems with their numerical simulation , because such models are known to suffer from the notorious fermion sign problem .",
    "however , based on a fermion cluster algorithm @xcite , a recently proposed method @xcite may circumvent this difficulty .",
    "however , we postpone further considerations of numerical simulations of quantum link qcd with dynamical quarks .",
    "the main issue of this paper is to present the quantum link formulation of qcd .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "quantum link models with @xmath0 and @xmath2 gauge symmetries are constructed and in section 3 it is discussed how these models are related to ordinary 4-d yang - mills theories via dimensional reduction . in section 4",
    "quantum link models are reformulated in terms of rishons  the fermionic constituents of the gluons .",
    "the inclusion of quarks is discussed in section 5 within the framework of shamir s variant of kaplan s fermion method .",
    "the representation of the @xmath0 gauge invariant quantum link hamiltonian , in terms of glueball , meson and constituent quark operators , is worked out in section 6 .",
    "finally , section 7 contains our conclusions .",
    "quantum link models were first discussed by horn @xcite .",
    "he constructed models with @xmath0 and @xmath1 gauge groups , but he pointed out that his construction can not be generalized to @xmath2 .",
    "further , the recent application of quantum link models to yang - mills theory via dimensional reduction was discussed only for @xmath1 @xcite . here",
    "we explicitly construct quantum link models with an @xmath2 gauge symmetry .",
    "obviously , this is essential for the quantum link formulation of qcd with an @xmath3 gauge group .",
    "let us first recall the standard formulation of lattice gauge theory . in that case",
    "there is an @xmath2 matrix @xmath9 associated with each link @xmath10 on a 4-d hypercubic lattice .",
    "the action is given by @xmath11 = - \\sum_{x,\\mu \\neq \\nu } \\mbox{tr } [ u_{x,\\mu } u_{x+\\hat\\mu,\\nu }   u_{x+\\hat\\nu,\\mu}{^\\dagger}u_{x,\\nu}{^\\dagger}],\\ ] ] where the dagger denotes hermitean conjugation .",
    "the action is invariant under @xmath2 gauge transformations @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the vector of hermitean generators of @xmath2 with the usual commutation relations @xmath14 = 2 i f_{abc } \\lambda^c , \\",
    "\\mbox{tr } \\lambda^a \\lambda^b = 2 \\delta^{ab}.\\ ] ] the path integral is given by @xmath15),\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the non - abelian gauge coupling .",
    "formally , the above system can be viewed as one of classical statistical mechanics",
    ". then the action plays the role of the classical hamilton function and @xmath17 plays the role of the temperature .",
    "the 4-d @xmath2 lattice gauge theory is believed to have only one phase , in which the gluons are confined . due to asymptotic freedom , the continuum limit of the lattice model corresponds to @xmath18 .",
    "let us now construct a quantum link representation of @xmath2 lattice gauge theory .",
    "we replace the classical action ( or hamilton function in the language of statistical mechanics ) by a quantum hamilton operator @xmath19.\\ ] ] here the elements of the @xmath20 link matrices @xmath21 are operators acting in a hilbert space  not just c - numbers like in the standard formulation .",
    "naturally , the dagger now represents hermitean conjugation in both the hilbert space and the @xmath20 matrix space .",
    "note , however , that the trace in the above expression is only over the @xmath20 matrix space and not over the hilbert space .",
    "gauge invariance of the quantum link model requires that the above hamilton operator commutes with the generators @xmath22 of infinitesimal gauge transformations at each lattice site @xmath23 , which obey the standard local algebra @xmath24 = 2 i \\delta_{xy } f_{abc } g^c_x.\\ ] ] gauge covariance of a quantum link variable follows by construction if @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the unitary operator that represents a general gauge transformation in hilbert space .",
    "the above equation implies the following commutation relations @xmath27",
    "= \\delta_{x , y+\\hat\\mu } u_{y,\\mu } \\vec \\lambda - \\delta_{x , y } \\vec \\lambda u_{y,\\mu}.\\ ] ] in order to satisfy these relations we introduce @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are generators of right and left gauge transformations of the link variable @xmath21 .",
    "suppressing the link index @xmath10 , their commutation relations take the form @xmath31 = 2 i f_{abc } r^c , \\ [ l^a , l^b ] = 2 i f_{abc } l^c , \\ [ r^a , l^b ] = 0,\\ ] ] i.e. @xmath32 and @xmath33 generate an @xmath34 algebra on each link .",
    "the @xmath32 and @xmath33 operators associated with different links commute with each other .",
    "the commutation relations of eq.([gucommutator ] ) imply @xmath35 = u \\vec\\lambda , \\ [ \\vec l , u ] = - \\vec\\lambda u.\\ ] ] the above commutation relations are identical to those of the standard hamiltonian formulation of lattice gauge theories .",
    "there they are the canonical commutation relations between link variables , which play the role of coordinates , and electric field variables @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which play the role of canonical conjugate momenta . in the standard formulation",
    "the commutation relations are realized in an infinite dimensional hilbert space of square integrable wave functionals of the link variables .",
    "this hilbert space is necessarily infinite dimensional , because one insists that the elements of a link matrix commute with each other .",
    "quantum link models , on the other hand , have a finite dimensional hilbert space for each link , by allowing the elements of the link fields to have non - zero commutators .",
    "it is important to realize that this does not destroy the gauge symmetry of the problem .    for each link the above relations can be realized by using the generators of an @xmath4 algebra , with the @xmath36 algebra embedded in it . in the fundamental representation of @xmath4 ,",
    "for example , we can write @xmath37 the @xmath38 are a set of @xmath39 matrices ( one for each index pair @xmath40 ) of size @xmath20 with @xmath41 .",
    "the commutators of real and imaginary parts of the elements of the link matrices take the form @xmath42 = [ \\mbox{im } u_{ij},\\mbox{im } u_{kl } ] = - i ( \\delta_{ik } \\",
    "\\mbox{im } \\vec \\lambda_{jl } \\cdot \\vec r + \\delta_{jl } \\",
    "\\mbox{im } \\vec \\lambda_{ik }",
    "\\cdot \\vec l ) , \\nonumber \\\\ & & [ \\mbox{re } u_{ij},\\mbox{im } u_{kl } ] =   i ( \\delta_{ik } \\ \\mbox{re } \\vec \\lambda_{jl } \\cdot \\vec r - \\delta_{jl } \\",
    "\\mbox{re } \\vec \\lambda_{ik } \\cdot \\vec l + \\frac{2}{n } \\delta_{ik } \\delta_{jl } t ) .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in particular , @xmath43 = [ ( u{^\\dagger})_{ij},(u{^\\dagger})_{kl } ] = 0 $ ] .",
    "again , we should emphasize that the commutation relations are local , namely all commutators between operators assigned to different links are zero .",
    "the additional generator @xmath44 is given by @xmath45 the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath39 matrix elements @xmath46 are represented by @xmath47 hermitean generators of @xmath4 . together with the @xmath48 generators @xmath32 and @xmath33 of right and left gauge transformations and the generator @xmath44 , these are the @xmath49 generators of @xmath4 . the generator @xmath44 commutes with the generators of @xmath2 gauge transformations , i.e. @xmath50 = [ t,\\vec l ] = 0,\\ ] ] but not with the elements of the link matrices , because @xmath51 = 2 u , \\ [ t , u{^\\dagger } ] = - 2 u{^\\dagger}.\\ ] ] this relation implies that @xmath52 generates an additional @xmath8 gauge transformation , i.e. @xmath53 indeed the hamilton operator of eq.([hamiltonian ] ) is also invariant under the extra @xmath8 gauge transformations and thus describes a @xmath0 lattice gauge theory . the @xmath1 quantum link model of ref.@xcite works with the generators of @xmath54 instead of @xmath55 .",
    "that construction does not have the additional @xmath8 gauge symmetry , but it can not be generalized to @xmath2 as will be explained below .",
    "the question then arises how quantum link models can be used to represent qcd .",
    "the answer is surprisingly simple .",
    "all one needs to do is to break the additional @xmath8 gauge symmetry by adding the real part of the determinant of each link matrix to the hamilton operator , such that now @xmath56 + j ' \\sum_{x,\\mu } \\ [ \\mbox{det } u_{x,\\mu } + \\mbox{det } u{^\\dagger}_{x,\\mu}].\\ ] ] since all elements of @xmath21 commute with each other ( although the real and imaginary parts of an individual element do not commute ) the definition of @xmath57 does not suffer from operator ordering ambiguities . by construction",
    "the above hamiltonian is invariant under @xmath2 but not under the extra @xmath8 gauge transformations .",
    "however , there is a subtlety that needs to be discussed . in the fundamental representation of @xmath4 , that was discussed above",
    ", the operator that represents @xmath57 turns out to be zero .",
    "hence , in that case even the hamiltonian of eq.([hamdet ] ) has a @xmath0 gauge invariance . on the other hand ,",
    "since the above commutation relations can be realized with any representation of @xmath4 , we can use higher representations in which the determinant in general does not vanish . in section 4",
    "it will become clear that the @xmath58-dimensional representation of @xmath4 is the smallest with a non - vanishing determinant .",
    "for qcd the hilbert space of the corresponding @xmath3 quantum link model then is the direct product of 20-dimensional hilbert spaces associated with each link . specifying the state on a link",
    "thus requires just 5 bits ( because @xmath59 ) . in the standard formulation of lattice gauge theory , on the other hand",
    ", in the computer an @xmath3 link variable is usually represented by 18 real numbers , which , for example , on a cray corresponds to 912 bits .    at this point",
    "it is easy to see why there is a special construction for @xmath1 using a 4-dimensional representation @xcite . under gauge transformations the quantum link operator @xmath60 transforms as an @xmath61 tensor . in @xmath1 the fundamental representation @xmath62 and its conjugate @xmath63 are unitarily equivalent .",
    "consequently , one can construct another quantum link operator using @xmath64 with the same @xmath1 gauge transformation properties as @xmath60 .",
    "a linear combination of the two operators leads to a quantum hamiltonian with @xmath1  but not @xmath65  gauge symmetry . indeed , adding them with equal weight gives the @xmath54 construction of @xcite .",
    "it should be clear that the hamiltonians of eqs.([hamiltonian ] ) and ( [ hamdet ] ) represent just the simplest members of a large class of @xmath0 and @xmath2 invariant quantum link models .",
    "like in ordinary lattice gauge theories , the action ( in this case the hamiltonian ) can be improved by including more complicated terms , for example , a six - link loop around a double plaquette .",
    "further , it is possible to break the extra @xmath8 gauge symmetry by antisymmetrized combinations of various paths connecting two lattice points  not just by the determinant operator on a single link . in that way one can construct @xmath2 invariant quantum link hamiltonians even with the fundamental representation of @xmath4 , but with more complicated interactions . in the 15-dimensional representation of @xmath66",
    "one can construct a more complicated plaquette action that leads to an @xmath3 invariant theory , even without the link determinant term .",
    "all these options may become important when the question of the most efficient numerical treatment of quantum link models will be addressed .    for the moment we limit ourselves to the discussion of one natural extension of the hamilton operators from before .",
    "as it was discussed in ref.@xcite , the operators @xmath67 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 resemble abelian and non - abelian 5-d electric fluxes associated with the link @xmath10 .",
    "on the other hand , from a 5-d point of view the plaquette term in the above hamilton operators represents the magnetic part of the energy only .",
    "hence , it would be natural to add a 5-d electric term as well .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath68 + j ' \\sum_{x,\\mu } \\ [ \\mbox{det } u_{x,\\mu } + \\mbox{det } u{^\\dagger}_{x,\\mu } ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + & j '' \\sum_{x,\\mu } \\ [ \\vec r^2_{x,\\mu } + \\vec l^2_{x,\\mu } ] + j ' '' \\sum_{x,\\mu } \\ t^2_{x,\\mu}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this hamiltonian is still gauge invariant , because @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are casimir operators of @xmath72 , which commute with the generators of all gauge transformations . in the fundamental representation of @xmath4 the above combination of casimir operators",
    "is proportional to the unit matrix and has no effect on the dynamics .",
    "this is not the case for the higher - dimensional representations of @xmath4 . in principle",
    ", one can also include the other casimir operators of @xmath72 in the hamiltonian .",
    "the above choice of casimir operators is most natural , because it represents abelian and non - abelian 5-d electric field energies . in the following we present universality arguments , which suggest that quantum link models defined with a 4-d hamiltonian ( describing the evolution of the system in a fifth euclidean direction ) get dimensionally reduced to ordinary 4-d yang - mills theories .",
    "these arguments are based on symmetry considerations and they apply to all @xmath2 invariant hamiltonians discussed in this section . in the standard formulation of lattice gauge theories , one must include the electric terms in the action in order to get non - trivial dynamics .",
    "since the real and imaginary parts of the elements of a quantum link operator do not commute , the dynamics of a quantum link model is already non - trivial without the electric terms . for simplicity ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to @xmath73 for the rest of this paper .",
    "as discussed in detail in ref.@xcite , quantum link models in @xmath5 dimensions are related to ordinary 4-d gauge theories via dimensional reduction .",
    "the hamilton operator of the quantum link model , which is defined on a 4-d lattice , describes the evolution of the system in a fifth euclidean direction .",
    "the crucial observation is that a genuine 5-d non - abelian gauge theory has deconfined massless gluons and thus an infinite correlation length .",
    "when periodic boundary conditions are imposed in the fifth direction and its extent @xmath74 is made finite , the extent of the extra dimension is thus negligible compared to the correlation length .",
    "hence , the theory appears to be dimensionally reduced to four dimensions .",
    "of course , in four dimensions the confinement hypothesis suggests that gluons are no longer massless .",
    "indeed , as it was argued in ref.@xcite , a glueball mass @xmath75 is expected to be generated non - perturbatively . here",
    "@xmath76 is the renormalized dimensionful gauge coupling of the 5-d gauge theory . for large @xmath74 the gauge coupling of the dimensionally reduced 4-d theory",
    "is given by @xmath77 thus the continuum limit @xmath18 of the 4-d theory is approached when one sends the extent @xmath74 of the fifth direction to infinity .",
    "hence , in contrast to naive expectations , dimensional reduction occurs when the extent of the fifth direction becomes large .",
    "this is due to asymptotic freedom , which implies that the correlation length @xmath78 grows exponentially with @xmath74 .",
    "when a gauge theory is dimensionally reduced , usually the polyakov loop in the extra dimension appears as an adjoint scalar field .",
    "here we want to obtain pure 4-d yang - mills theory ( without charged scalars ) after dimensional reduction .",
    "this can be achieved if one does not impose gauss law for the states propagating in the fifth dimension , because the polyakov loop is a lagrange multiplier field that enforces the gauss law .",
    "formally , this can be realized simply by putting the fifth component of the gauge potential to zero , i.e. @xmath79 in the infinite volume limit of the 5-d theory this restriction has no effect on the dynamics . with finite extent in the fifth direction",
    ", however , it deviates from the standard formulation of gauge theories .",
    "the leading terms in the low energy effective action of the 5-d gauge theory corresponding to the quantum link model take the form @xmath80 = \\int_0^\\beta dx_5 \\int d^4x \\",
    "\\frac{1}{2 e^2}[\\mbox{tr } \\",
    "f_{\\mu\\nu } f_{\\mu\\nu } + \\frac{1}{c^2 } \\mbox{tr } \\   \\partial_5 a_\\mu \\partial_5 a_\\mu].\\ ] ]",
    "we expect that the qcd quantum link model leads to a 5-d gauge theory characterized by the `` velocity of light '' @xmath81",
    ". note that here @xmath82 runs over 4-d indices only . at finite @xmath74",
    "the above theory has only a 4-d gauge invariance , because we have fixed @xmath83 , i.e. we have not imposed the gauss law .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath84 a full 5-d gauge symmetry is recovered , although the above action then still is in @xmath83 gauge .",
    "since we are interested in dimensional reduction , a 4-d gauge symmetry is sufficient for our purposes . on the level of the quantum link model ,",
    "not imposing gauss law is achieved by simply writing the quantum statistical partition function as @xmath85 in contrast to the standard formulation of gauge theories we have not included a projection operator on gauge invariant states , i.e. gauge variant states also propagate in the fifth direction .",
    "the hamilton operator of the quantum link model is defined on a 4-d space - time lattice and describes the evolution of the system in the fifth unphysical direction . in particular , all the information about the physical spectrum of the 4-d theory is contained in correlation functions in the euclidean time direction , which is part of the 4-d lattice .",
    "note that the physical gauss law is properly imposed because the model does contain non - trivial polyakov loops in the euclidean time direction . in the continuum limit @xmath18 , which we approach by increasing the extent @xmath74 of the fifth dimension , we are probing the low lying states in the spectrum of the 4-d hamilton operator of the quantum link model .",
    "the space - time correlations in these unphysical states of the 4-d hamiltonian contain the information about the physical spectrum .",
    "it is useful to think of the dimensionally reduced 4-d theory as a lattice theory with lattice spacing @xmath86 ( which has nothing to do with the lattice spacing of the quantum link model ) .",
    "in fact , one can imagine performing a block renormalization group transformation that averages the 5-d field over cubic blocks of size @xmath74 in the fifth direction and of size @xmath86 in the four physical space - time directions .",
    "the block centers then form a 4-d space - time lattice of spacing @xmath86 and the effective theory of the block averaged 5-d field is indeed a 4-d lattice theory .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.3 .",
    "a similar argument was first used by hasenfratz and niedermayer @xcite in their study of 2-d quantum antiferromagnets .    the partition function of eq.([gaugez ] )",
    "can be written as a 5-d path integral of discrete variables  in the @xmath3 case the states of the 20-dimensional representation of @xmath66 on each link . in many respects this path integral",
    "resembles that of quantum spin systems , which can be simulated by very efficient loop cluster algorithms . due to the discrete nature of the hilbert space",
    ", one can even work directly in the continuum for the extra euclidean direction @xcite .",
    "indeed for a @xmath8 quantum link model a cluster algorithm operating in the continuum has already been constructed @xcite .",
    "it is plausible that cluster algorithms can also be constructed for non - abelian quantum link models , which would allow high - precision simulations of gauge theories .",
    "in this section we reformulate quantum link models using anticommuting operators describing fermionic constituents of the gluons .",
    "in contrast to composite models @xcite , our rishons are not physical particles , because they are absolutely tightly bound into gluons and there is no kinetic term for the rishons .",
    "still , the rishons are convenient mathematical objects that provide theoretical insight into the physics of quantum link models .",
    "the rishon representation is interesting both from an analytic and from a computational point of view .",
    "first , it may lead to a new way to attack the large @xmath6 limit of qcd and other non - perturbative quantum field theories .",

    "the partition function of the theory with open boundary conditions for the quarks and with periodic boundary conditions for the gluons is simply given by @xmath125 here the trace extends only over the gluonic hilbert space of the quantum link model , thus implementing periodic boundary conditions for the gluons .",

    "of course , unlike periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions , open boundary conditions for the fermions break translation invariance in the fifth direction . through the interaction between quarks and gluons ,",

    "similarly , at present we can not guarantee that the low - energy excitations of a 4-d @xmath3 invariant quantum link model formulated with the 20-dimensional representation of @xmath66 are 5-d massless gluons .",
    "however , this should at least be the case in the classical limit , i.e. when we work with a large representation of @xmath66 .",
    "it is remarkable that the introduction of a fifth euclidean direction of finite extent also naturally protects the chiral symmetries of lattice fermions , when open boundary conditions are used for the quarks at the two 4-d boundaries of the 5-d slab ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "this set - up  first proposed by shamir as a variant of kaplan s fermion method  fits very naturally with quantum link models . due to tunneling between the two boundaries ,",
    "a fermionic correlation length is generated , which is also exponentially large in @xmath74 .",
    "quantum link qcd treats quarks and gluons on an equal footing .",
    "they both have finite hilbert spaces ( per unit volume ) , both require a fifth euclidean direction that finally disappears via dimensional reduction and they both have correlation lengths that are exponential in @xmath74 without requiring fine - tuning .",
    "we believe that these properties point to an interesting connection between fermions and gauge fields in quantum link models .",
    "this may help in attempting to formulate chiral or supersymmetric gauge theories on the lattice .    due to the fact that their gluonic hilbert space is finite , quantum link models can be expressed in terms of rishons , which are fermionic constituents of the gluons .",
    "the rishon dynamics can probably not be formulated as a continuum field theory .",
    "therefore we consider the rishons as lattice artifacts in our way to formulate qcd .",
    "the gluons in quantum link models are composites of rishons , just like antiferromagnetic magnons can be viewed as composites of electrons that are hopping on a lattice . of course , in that case we know that the electrons are real particles , which are hopping on a real crystal lattice",
    ". if our world is a thin five - dimensional slab with a lattice structure at extremely small distances , the rishons in quantum link models could be real particles .",
    "we do not want to speculate about that possibility and thus we consider them as mathematical objects only .",
    "however , the rishons may turn out to be of great importance for solving qcd in the large @xmath6 limit .",
    "we consider this possibility the most promising analytic aspect of the new formulation .    at finite @xmath6",
    "we do not see a way to solve quantum link models analytically .",
    "however , from a computational point of view quantum link qcd is still very attractive , in particular because the new framework may allow one to construct very efficient cluster algorithms .",
    "the five - dimensional set - up is not as inconvenient as it may seem , because  due to the discrete nature of the hilbert space  the 5-d path integral for quantum link models can be formulated and  most important  also be simulated directly in the continuum of the fifth euclidean dimension .",
    "in fact , even in the standard formulation of lattice",
    "qcd it may turn out to be advantageous to work in five dimensions in order to control the chiral properties of the quarks .",
    "it remains to be seen if quantum link models provide a more efficient formulation of qcd than standard lattice gauge theory .",
    "in any case , quantum link models allow us to attack the long - standing qcd problem from a different perspective .",
    "we are indebted to m. basler , b. beard , d. chen , s. levit , p. orland , y. shamir and a. tsapalis for very interesting discussions .",
    "one of the authors ( u .- j .",
    "w. ) likes to thank the theory group of the weizmann institute in rehovot , where part of this work was done , for its hospitality and the a. p. sloan foundation for its support ."
