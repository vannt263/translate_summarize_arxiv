    "<S> we study the temperature dependence of nuclear magnetic relaxation ( nmr ) rates to detect a sign of topological superconductivity in doped topological insulators , such as _ m_(@xmath0cu , nb , sr)@xmath1bi@xmath2se@xmath3 and sn@xmath4in@xmath1te . </S>",
    "<S> the hebel - slichter coherence effect below a critical temperature @xmath5 depends on the superconducting states predicted by a minimal model of doped topological insulators . in a nodal anisotropic topological state similar to the abm - phase in @xmath6he , the nmr rate has a conventional @xmath7-wave like coherence peak below @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in a fully - gapped isotropic topological superconducting state , this rate below @xmath5 exhibits an anti - peak profile . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in a two - fold in - plane anisotropic topological superconducting state , there is no coherence effect , which is similar to that in a chiral @xmath8-wave state . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we reveal that the nmr rates shed light on unconventional superconductivity in doped topological insulators . </S>"
