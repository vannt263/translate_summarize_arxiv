    "electron spin qubit is a promising candidate for realizing quantum computing because of its long coherence time @xcite .",

    "it is inevitable that quantum information is transferred over finite distances frequently .",
    "one straightforward way to achieve such communication is to move the qubits themselves directly .",
    "there are several proposed schemes on how to move spin qubits efficiently @xcite , where the motion of the confined electron can be induced by either varying gate voltages or a surface acoustic wave ( saw ) .",
    "however , introducing this orbital ( albeit controlled ) dynamics could weaken the orbital quantization that gives rise to the long spin coherence times .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite we have shown how electrostatic disorder in the substrate may cause relaxation of a moving spin qubit through spin - orbit interaction .",
    "nevertheless , more studies are still needed to clarify decoherence of a moving spin qubit .",
    "doppler effect is a commonly observed phenomenon when an object is moving , where an observer hears different pitches from the horn of an approaching and a departing vehicle . when the velocity of the object is larger than the speed of the waves produced by the motion , a directional shock wave ( cherenkov effect )",
    "can be observed , from the wake of a speeding boat , to the sonic boom from a supersonic airplane , to cherenkov radiation from a fast - moving charge in a material with high refraction index @xcite .",
    "classically ( as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) , a superposition of the spherical waves emitted by a moving object at different moments form a straight - line wavefront @xmath0 , and the wavefront propagates in the @xmath1 direction , at the cherenkov angle from the motion direction : @xmath2 since cherenkov radiation is highly directional , it is often used to detect properties of moving charged particles .",
    "( color online ) a schematic diagram of a moving spin qubit interacting with phonon reservoir and the resultant doppler effect in the three cases . ]    here we study how motion of a spin qubit could modify its relaxation due to spin - orbit interaction and electron - phonon interaction @xcite .",
    "in particular , we identify different regimes of quantum dot moving velocity where we can find analogues of doppler effect , cherenkov radiation , and sonic boom in the spin relaxation and the associated phonon emission . more specifically , when the quantum dot ( qd ) moves with a speed lower than the speed of sound , the energy of an emitted phonon is dependent on the direction of emission , similar to the doppler effect .",
    "when the qd moves faster than the speed of sound , the dominant contributions to spin relaxation come from phonons emitted along certain directions , similar to the classical cherenkov effect .",
    "our calculation predicts a small correction to the cherenkov angle caused by the quantum confinement . in the transition from subsonic to supersonic regime",
    ", we observe a peak in spin relaxation rate , which we term as a spin relaxation boom in analogy to the classical sonic boom .",

    "in section v we discuss the implications of our results , and in section vi we present our conclusions .",
    "in addition , in the appendices we give brief summaries of our theoretical derivations with regard to spin - orbit interaction in the context of a moving spin qubit .",
    "the system we consider is a single electron confined in a moving qd formed from a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , as is shown in fig .",

    "the qubit ( electron ) is moved at a constant speed @xmath3 , presumably achieved by programming the gates or using the surface acoustic waves .",

    "in this section we analyze the angular dependence of the phonon emission ( in terms of the kernel function @xmath44 ) from the relaxing spin qubit in different regimes of qd moving speed .",
    "in particular , in the subsonic regime , we find the doppler effect , in which phonons emitted in different directions have different frequencies . in the transonic regime",
    "we find the formation of a shock wave front and its bifurcation into two directions as the qd speed passes the speed of sound .",

    "these shifts are exactly as one would find in the classical doppler effect",
    ".    it may seem puzzling that the energy quantum carried by the emitted phonon is not the same as the zeeman splitting of the spin qubit .",
    "the discrepancy here can be accounted for by the fact that the moving quantum dot is an open system .",
    "it is driven by a classical force that comes from either programmed gate potential or the large number of phonons in an saw .",
    "the excess or shortage of energy in the spin relaxation is absorbed / added by the classical `` reservoir '' .",

    "when the moving velocity is larger than the critical velocity ( d ) , the single shock wave front splits into two ( we only consider the @xmath70 plane . in 3d the wave front is conical ) .",
    "quantum mechanically , we find that the moving spin qubit indeed follows qualitatively the classical behavior . figure [ fig : boom ] shows the qd speed @xmath3 and angle @xmath50 dependence of the kernel function @xmath44 ( we have chosen @xmath67 to maximize @xmath44 ) . when @xmath71 @xcite , the angular distribution is relatively flat . when taking into account that phonon emission in spin relaxation is enabled by spin - orbit interaction , there is a pretty strong @xmath72 angular dependence for @xmath44 , so that emission along directions perpendicular to the direction of motion is suppressed .",

    "<S> we also find that the moving spin qubit may have a lower relaxation rate than a static qubit , which hints at the possibility of coherence - preserving transportation for a spin qubit . </S>",
    "<S> while the physics we have studied here has strong classical analogies , we do find that quantum confinement for the spin qubit plays an important role in all the phenomena we observe . </S>",
