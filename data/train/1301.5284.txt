    "infrared dark clouds ( _ irdcs _ ) are the dark extinction regions of high contrast against the bright galactic mid - infrared background , discovered by the _ midcourse space experiment_(_msx _ ) @xcite and _ infrared space observatory_(_iso _ ) surveys@xcite .",
    "@xcite identified 10,931 _ irdcs _ candidates using _ msx _ @xmath14 data .",
    "@xcite showed that these identified _ irdcs _ are located in the fourth quadrant and first quadrant of the galaxy at a galactocentric distances of 6 kpc and 5 kpc , respectively .",
    "additionally , @xcite identified 11,303 _ irdcs _ candidates using _ spitzer _ @xmath15 data .",
    "previous researchers suggested that irdcs were the cold ( @xmath16 k ) and dense ( @xmath17 ) regions , with a scale of 1@xmath1810 pc and a mass of @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that the cores within the_irdcs _ may be in different phase , from a quiescent to an active , and finally into a red core .",
    "the quiescent cores represent the earliest preprotostellar ( starless ) core phase without infrared signatures , while the active cores have the extended and enhanced @xmath20 emission with an embedded @xmath21 emission source .",
    "when a core shows the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission at @xmath15 , it is considered to be in the finally red core stage .",
    "furthermore , these detected cores have the strong dust emission from millimetre and submillimetre bands @xcite and only some cores have embedded protostars , indicating that the _ irdcs _ may represent the earliest observable stage of high - mass star formation . thus , irdcs can provide us with an opportunity to study the physical and chemical conditions of massive star - forming processes in the earliest stage .    in this paper , we have analyzed 14 southern _ irdcs _ using @xmath22(1 - 0 ) , hnc(1 - 0 ) , hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) , and hcn(1 - 0 ) molecular lines from the _ millimetre astronomy legacy team 90 ghz ( malt90 ) _ survey @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 , hnc , hco@xmath23 , and hcn are good tracers of dense gases . and @xmath0 is known to be a good tracer of the compact center of the cores .",
    "observations of the molecular lines could provide valuable information on the physical and chemical significance of _",
    "@xcite made a @xmath24 _ msx _ _ irdc _ catalog containing 10,931 _ irdc _ candidates .",
    "combined this catalog with the _ malt90 _ survey , we select 18 southern _ irdc _ candidates , but only 14 of them have @xmath0(1 - 0 ) , hnc(1 - 0 ) , hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) , and hcn(1 - 0 ) emission with high signal - noise ratio .",
    "these lines are all good tracers of dense gases , but provide slightly different information .",
    "@xmath0 was more resistant to freeze - out on grains than the carbon - bearing species @xcite .",
    "hnc was particularly prevalent in cold gas @xcite .",
    "@xmath7 often showed infall signatures and outflow wings @xcite .",
    "the _ spitzer irac _",
    "@xmath25 data of these selected _ irdcs _ are presented ( gray ) in figures 1 - 14 , and the basic information are summarized in tables 1 - 2 .",
    "the data extracted from the _ millimetre astronomy legacy team 90 ghz ( malt90 ) _ , _ glimpse _ and _ mipsgal _ surveys are analyzed toward the 14 southern _",
    "irdcs_.    malt90 is a large international project aimed at characterizing high - mass dense cores in the southern sky at 90 ghz with the mopra 22-m telescope .",
    "the angular resolution of mopra telescope is about @xmath26 .",
    "the correction for the line intensities to the main beam brightness temperature scale is made by using the formula @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the frequency - dependent beam efficiency . the main beam efficiency at 86 ghz is @xmath29 , and at 110 ghz is @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "_ malt90 _ data cubes are downloaded from online archive .",
    "the data are reduced by the software class ( continuum and line analysis single - disk software ) and greg ( grenoble graphic ) .",
    "_ glimpse _ is a mid - infrared survey of the inner galaxy performed with the _ spitzer space telescope_. _ mipsgal _ is a survey of the same region as _ glimpse _ , using the _ mips _ instrument ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) on _ spitzer_. we use the mosaicked images of _ glimpse _ at _ spitzer irac _ @xmath25 and _ mipsgal _ at @xmath33 . _",
