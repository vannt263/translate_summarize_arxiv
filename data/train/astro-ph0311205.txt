    "galaxy clusters are important laboratories in which to study physical processes that are generally inaccessible in other environments . for example the radial density profile and the projected ellipticity of clusters on the sky may offer valuable clues into the nature of dark matter ( e.g. ,  spergel & steinhardt 2001 ; sand et al .  2002 ; 2003 ; miralda - escud 2002 ; arabadjis et al .",
    "2002 ) . complications often arise in cluster  based studies of dark matter due to the presence of baryons ( e.g. ,  allen 1998 ; smith et al .  2001 ; lewis et al .  2003 ) .",
    "however , from a broader perspective such complications provide us with important clues into the physics of gas cooling , and inter  play between baryons and dark matter , both of which are central to attempts to understand the physics of galaxy formation ( e.g. ,  cole et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "progress towards these goals requires detailed study of the distribution of mass in clusters .",
    "strong gravitational lensing offers a direct and precise probe of cluster mass distributions ( e.g. ,  kneib et al .",
    "1996 ; smith 2002 ; smith et al .  2003 ) .",
    "complementary constraints can also be obtained from x  ray observations ( e.g. ,  allen et al .  2002 ) , weak lensing ( e.g. ,  kneib et al .",
    "2003 ) and the three  dimensional distribution of cluster galaxies ( e.g. ,  czoske et al .",
    "a combination of these techniques is necessary for a comprehensive understanding of mass in clusters .",
    "armed with the results from such multi  wavelength studies , robust constraints on the dark matter particle and gas cooling may ultimately flow .",
    "we have conducted a snapshot survey of 55 x  ray luminous galaxy clusters with the wfpc2 camera on  board _ hst _ ( pid s 8301 & 8719 ; pi edge ) .",
    "a key goal of this survey is to uncover new cluster lenses with which to explore the questions outlined above .",
    "the snapshot observing strategy is well  suited to identifying clusters containing rare and powerful constraints such as radial arcs ( e.g. ,  rxj1133  sand et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "in this letter we present an _ hst _",
    "observation of a1201 ( @xmath0 ; @xmath8  [ j2000 ] ; @xmath9erg / s [ 0.12.4kev ]  ebeling et al .",
    "these data reveal a tangential arc @xmath4 from the optical centroid of the bcg .",
    "spectroscopic observations at the keck observatory confirm that the arc is a gravitationally  lensed galaxy at @xmath1 (  2 ) .",
    "the best  fit gravitational lens model faithfully reproduces the arc morphology , however the total matter distribution of this model appears to be much more elongated than the optical isophotes of the bcg (  3 ) .",
    "we also discuss the uniqueness of this small  scale gravitational arc by comparing it with other known cluster lenses , and outline how follow  up optical and x  ray observations will help to fully exploit this powerful new constraint on the matter distribution in cluster cores (  4 ) .",
    "we assume @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in this cosmology , @xmath13 at @xmath0 and @xmath14 at @xmath1 .",
    "a1201 was observed through the f606w filter with _ hst _ using the wfpc2 camera on april 7 , 2001 .",
    "we combined the @xmath15sec exposures into a single mosaic using standard iraf tasks , and present in fig .  1 the region of the wf3 chip ( @xmath16 ) that contains the central galaxy .",
    "this frame reveals a tangentially distorted arc at a radius of @xmath4 from the optical centroid of the bcg .",
    "we interpret this arc as arising from the gravitational distortion of a background galaxy by the foreground cluster potential .",
    "the arc was observed with the echelle imaging spectrograph ( esi  sheinis et al .",
    "2002 ) on the keck ",
    "ii 10m telescope on the night of april 12 , 2002 , in @xmath17 seeing .",
    "these observations and the reduction of the data are described in detail by sand et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . in summary ,",
    "a @xmath18 slit was centered on the bcg , oriented to intersect the portions of the arc labeled a1b and a1c in fig .  1 .",
    "the total integration time was 7.2ksec .",
    "the final reduced spectrum covers the wavelength range @xmath19 , and contains [ oii  ( 3726,3729 ) ] , h@xmath20 , [ oiii  ( 4959,5007 ) ] and h@xmath21 at @xmath22 , 7053.5 , ( 7195.3,7264.7 ) , 9523.1respectively , in addition to numerous other emission and absorption features . from these spectral features ,",
    "we derive a redshift of @xmath1 for the arc , thus confirming the gravitational lensing interpretation .",
    "we label the different segments of the arc ( a1 ) in fig .  1 , together with the faint feature that lies within @xmath23 of the lower end of the arc ( a2 ) .",
    "the relatively high surface brightness of a1b / c and the dip in surface brightness between this pair implies that they are a pair of fold images arising from a portion of the galaxy that straddles the @xmath1 caustic in the source  plane .",
    "the de  magnified counter  image of this pair",
    "would then most likely be a1f .",
    "the position angle break between a1d and a1e probably arises from a combination of the source  plane morphology of the lensed galaxy and its orientation relative to the caustic curve .",
    "the emission from these two regions has insufficient signal  to  noise to support definitive statements regarding the multiple  image interpretation of a1d / e and indeed a1a .",
    "however given their similarities in surface ",
    "brightness , it is plausible that a1a / d / e are three images of the same portion of the galaxy .",
    "we construct a model of the projected mass distribution in a1201 using the lenstool software developed by kneib ( 1993 ; see also kneib et al .",
    "the model consists of a single lens plane at @xmath0 , comprising two mass components ( cluster  scale dark matter halo and bcg ) that we parametrize as truncated pseudo  isothermal elliptical mass distributions ( piemd  kassiola & kovner 1993 ) .",
    "the projected cluster mass distribution is therefore described by fourteen parameters : @xmath24 for each of the two mass components .",
    "we match the central coordinates @xmath25 for each component to the optical centroid of the bcg , as measured from the _ hst _ frame .",
    "we also match the ellipticity ( @xmath26 ) and position angle ( @xmath27 ) of these two mass components to that of the observed light distribution measured at @xmath28 .",
    "typical values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 for cluster  scale mass components are 50@xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively ( smith 2002 )  i.e.  well beyond the physical scales probed by the arc in this cluster .",
    "we therefore fix these two parameters at @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively  we find that none of the results described below are sensitive to these choices .",
    "this leaves just four free parameters : the central velocity dispersion @xmath35 of the cluster and the core radius , cut  off radius and central velocity dispersion @xmath36 of the bcg .",
    "we first constrain these parameters using the image pair a1b / c and the location of the @xmath1 critical line that bisects these images .",
    "this model is an acceptable fit to these constraints ( @xmath37  see smith 2002 for a detailed explanation of how goodness  of  fit is estimated for such lens models ) , however it predicts that the counter ",
    "image of a1b / c lies @xmath38 closer to the center of the lens than the observed location of the candidate counter images ( i.e.  a1e and a1f ) .",
    "when a1f is added to the model constraints , the fit deteriorates significantly ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the most straight  forward way to improve the quality of this fit is to make the mass distribution more elliptical .",
    "we therefore include the ellipticity of the cluster  scale dark matter halo as a free parameter in the fit .",
    "this yields an acceptable fit for values of @xmath40 .",
    "this lower limit on the cluster ellipticity is insensitive to whether a1e or a1f are adopted as the third counter image of a1b / c .",
    "we also experiment with holding the ellipticity of the dark matter fixed at @xmath41 , and fitting for the ellipticity of the bcg , obtaining @xmath42 .",
    "fixing @xmath43 and fitting for the ellipticity of the total matter distribution , we obtain @xmath44 . in summary , the underlying cluster total mass distribution appears to be significantly more elliptical than the spatial distribution of stars in the bcg .",

    "we also explore the possibility that a1201 is bi  modal , and examine the _ hst _ data for evidence of a second cluster ",
    "scale mass clump .",
    "an @xmath66 cluster galaxy lies on the wf2 chip in the same direction as the position angle of the cluster mass distribution , suggesting that a second mass clump may be associated with this galaxy . however , there are no other bright cluster members in this vicinity , indicating that this scenario is quite unlikely ( smith et al .",
    "weak shear maps may also be used to infer the likely morphology of cluster mass distributions ( e.g. ,  kneib et al .",
    "1996 ) , however the short exposure time of these _ hst _ data preclude such an analysis for a1201 ( we estimate that just @xmath67 suitable faint galaxies are available across the entire wfpc2 field of view ) . despite the weak evidence for its existence",
    ", we quantify how massive a second cluster  scale dark matter halo would have to be in order to explain the observed multiple  images .",
    "we fix the ellipticity of the central dark matter halo and bcg at @xmath68 and add a circular dark matter halo at the position of the bright cluster galaxy noted above . the best  fit velocity dispersion of this dark matter halo is @xmath69 ( with @xmath30 and @xmath70 held fixed at @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively ) . in this bimodal model ,",
    "the velocity dispersion of the central dark matter halo is @xmath73 , suggesting that if a1201 is bimodal , then the dominant mass component would not be coincident with the bcg .    in summary , although a bi  modal mass distribution is allowed by the current shallow _ hst _ data , we suggest that an elliptical mass distribution is the more likely explanation of the strong lensing signal in this cluster .",
    "we also note that our forthcoming _",
    "chandra _ observations ( pid : 04800980 , pi : edge ) will be the first pointed x  ray observations of this cluster .",
    "the x  ray pass  band therefore currently offers no clues on the cluster mass distribution .      we adopt the model described in  3.1 in which @xmath74 and @xmath40 as the fiducial lens model and list the relevant parameters in table  1",
    ". we ray  trace each portion of the arc through the fiducial model back to the source  plane to double check our interpretation of the multiple  images .",
    "we summarize this exercise with the white ellipse in fig .  1 which shows the position , size and orientation of the galaxy in the source  plane .",
    "a1 therefore appears to be an elongated galaxy , possibly an edge  on star ",
    "forming disk galaxy .",
    "the observed morphology of the arc may therefore be explained by a combination of the elongated source  plane morphology and the orientation of this galaxy relative to the caustic which we over  plot as the white astroid in fig .  1 .",
    "integral field unit spectroscopic observations of this arc ( e.g. ,  swinbank et al .",
    "2003 ) would help to confirm our interpretation of the arc as arising from an edge  on galaxy .",
    "we also use the fiducial model to measure the projected mass enclosed within the @xmath1 tangential critical curve , obtaining @xmath75 , where the uncertainty is estimated from a family of lens models that satisfy @xmath76 .",
    "we identify these models by exploring the five  dimensional parameter space defined by the free parameters in the fiducial best  fit model .",
    "the observed magnitude of the bcg in the same aperture is @xmath77 . correcting to the observed @xmath78band and applying both @xmath79correction and galactic extinction ( sand et al .",
    "2003 ) we obtain @xmath80 .",
    "the total mass  to  light ratio of a1201 on the scales probed by the tangential arc projected along the line of sight is therefore @xmath81 .",
    "this number is larger than values typical of stellar populations of early  type galaxies ( e.g. ,  gerhard et al .",
    "indeed , the joint lensing and dynamical analysis of this cluster by sand et al.(2003 ) yields a stellar mass  to  light ratio of @xmath82 .",
    "we therefore conclude that @xmath83 of the mass within the cylinder of radius @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath84 of the effective radius , is in the form of dark matter ( i.e. the ratio of stellar to total mass to light ratios ) .",
    "a1201 is drawn from a sample of @xmath85 x  ray luminous clusters observed with _ hst _ in the edge et al .",
    "( pids : 8301 & 8719 ) snapshot survey of bcgs .",
    "this snapshot survey doubles the number of clusters that have been observed to date with either the wfpc2 or acs cameras . among these @xmath67 clusters ,",
    "a1201 is the only system with a tangential arc on scales as small as @xmath28 .",
    "this rarity underlines the importance and efficiency of snapshot surveys with _",
    "hst _ to discover such small  scale probes of the mass distribution in clusters .",
    "we also investigate the uniqueness of the tangential arc in a1201 among multiple  image systems in spectroscopically confirmed cluster lenses .",
    "the deflection angle of a gravitational lens depends on the angular diameter distance ratio @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the distance from the lens to the source and @xmath88 is the distance from the observer to the source .",
    "we plot the distribution of distance ratios for known multiple  image systems in fig .",
    "[ hist ] , based on an extensive review of the _ hst _ archive and the published literature ( see sand et al .",
    "2004 , in prep.for more details ) .",
    "the cluster sample upon which this histogram is based is heterogeneous .",
    "we therefore also plot ( as the dashed histogram ) the distribution of distance ratios for the multiple  image systems identified thus far in a well  defined sample of x  ray luminous clusters at @xmath89 by smith ( 2002 ; see also smith et al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ; kneib et al .",

    "smith et al .",
    "2003 , in prep . ) .",
    "a1201 lies at the lower envelope of both multiple  image samples , with a value of @xmath90 . from a lens geometry perspective",
    ", a1201 is therefore unusual but not unique among the multiple  image systems discovered to date .",
    "other low @xmath86 systems include famous lensing clusters , for example the giant arc ( @xmath91 ; soucail et al .",
    "1988 ) in a370 ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "however , the higher redshift of this , and other clusters with low distance ratios renders the observed deflection angle ( @xmath93@xmath94 ) and the physical scales probed ( @xmath95120kpc ) much larger than that relevant to a1201 ( @xmath96kpc ) .",
    "a1201 is therefore unique in the small physical scales probed by its tangential arc .",

    "spectroscopy obtained with esi on the keck ",
    "ii telescope confirms the gravitational nature of the arc , and places the source galaxy at @xmath1 .",
    "we construct a gravitational lens model that is able to reproduce the observed arc morphology .",
    "the key feature of this model is that the total matter distribution is significantly more elongated ( @xmath2 ) than the light distribution of the bcg on @xmath4 scales ( @xmath97 ) . with the current data we are unable to determine whether the matter distribution really is more elongated than the stellar distribution , or if there is a significant amount of mass whose center of mass does not coincide with the bcg",
    "this could indicate that the cluster is dynamically less mature than the optical data suggest .",
    "the proximity of the arc to the center of this cluster is unique among cluster lenses , and provides an important constraint on the mass of the cluster on very small physical scales .",
    "we measure the projected mass within the tangential arc to be @xmath75 , and the @xmath78band mass  to  light ratio to be @xmath98 , the angular scale of @xmath4 corresponding to a physical scale of 6kpc .",
    "this constraint , in conjunction with complementary high  resolution space  based data from _ chandra _ and multi  color follow  up with _ hst_/acs will lead to substantial progress in understanding the distribution of mass in this cluster .",
    "extending the unique small  scale ( 6kpc ) mass constraint out to larger scales ( @xmath99500kpc ) also promises an important role for a1201 in the quest to understand the physical processes at play in galaxy cluster cores .",
