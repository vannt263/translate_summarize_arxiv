    "_    this result was proved by welschinger in his beautiful but mysterious(at least to the author ) papers @xcite,@xcite,@xcite in a more general setting .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide conceptually more natural approach to the proof of the invariance of the counting using the moduli spaces of @xmath0-holomorphic discs .",
    "first of all , one naturally expect that the count of the real @xmath0-holomorhic spheres should be related to the counting of real @xmath0-holomorphic discs since the former can be obtained as a complex double of the latter .",
    "but the exact statement with orientation is rather complicated .",
    "the most natural way to define an intersection number is as a degree of a certain map @xmath15 where @xmath3 , @xmath16 are oriented manifolds ( for @xmath16 connected ) . from the basic transversality theory ,",
    "the signed degree of @xmath17 , @xmath18 for some @xmath19 , is well - defined , and invariant under the choice of @xmath19 if the manifold @xmath3 has no boundary . in our case",
    ", we may try to consider an evaluation map @xmath20 from the moduli space of real @xmath0-holomorphic spheres to @xmath21 and consider its signed degree .",
    "but the moduli spaces of real @xmath0-holomorphic spheres are not known to be orientable ( in fact , the proposition [ pr : signfooo ] suggest that it is not orientable in general ) . hence we can not define the count as a degree of the map @xmath20 from the moduli space of real holomorphic spheres .",
    "our approach is to use the moduli spaces of @xmath0-holomorphic discs instead , because they carry coherent orientations when the lagrangian submanifold @xmath2 is orientable and ( relatively ) spin .",
    "but the disc moduli spaces have boundaries ( actually corners ) provided by the splitting of domain into two ( or more ) disc ( or sphere ) components .",
    "therefore , the signed degree of @xmath20 for each homotopy class of the discs is not well - defined .",
    "the idea , then is to put together several moduli spaces of holomorphic discs to make codimension one boundaries cancel out each other , so that the sum of signed degree is well - defined .",
    "we use the conjugation @xmath5 to make sure that there is always a matching pair for each boundary term .",
    "but , this also does not work , as the orientation changes of the conjugations depend on the maslov indices of the holomorphic discs and the number of marked points .",
    "hence , as we put together these moduli spaces of holomorphic discs , some boundaries cancel out , and some of them do not cancel out .",
    "but we show that for @xmath22 , if the evaluation map images of a boundary stratum actually form codimension one boundary of the images of the non - singular stratum , then we show that such stratum cancels out with sign . the codimension one strata which do not have codimension one images in fact are irrelevant to the argument to prove the well - definedness of the degree of the evaluation map .",
    "hence , in this case , the signed degree(which we call @xmath23-count ) is well - defined .    for the case @xmath24",
    ", we need to add additional sign corresponding to the cyclic ordering of the boundary marked points , and we show that the modified counting ( which we call @xmath25-count ) is well - defined .    the approach taken by welschinger is to define a sign ( spinor state ) to each preimage curve , ( not the whole moduli space ) , and to prove the invariance of the signed count as the configuration of points passes though critical points of the evaluation map @xmath20 or a reducible curve .",
    "the critical points of the evaluation maps are such as the images of cuspidal curves ( see@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "hence his proof is quite analytical as he needs to analyze the change of spinor state as the configuration crosses the critical values of the evaluation maps .",
    "our proof is rather combinatorial as we focus on the cancellation of signs .",
    "we can bypass the analysis on the transversality of the evaluation maps , because the well - definedness of the degree can be proved without such analysis .    in section 6 ,",
    "we show that the cancellation arguments easily generalizes to the counting of real holomorphic discs which intersect arbitrary pseudo - cycles of a symplectic manifold at the fixed interior marked points , and intersect real points at the boundary .",
    "the count is shown to be independent of the choices involved with the above assumptions and if the number of fixed interior marked points satisfies certain conditions .    in the last section",
    ", we compare the welschinger s spinor state with the coherent orientation of @xmath0-holomorphic discs defined by fukaya , oh , ohta and ono in @xcite .",
    "but we do not know if the signed degree defined in this paper is the same as welschinger invariants , but we expect they are related .",
    "they share the properties that the counting do not change as the configuration of points pass through images of reducible curves , or critical values of evaluation maps .",
    "our method does not generalize to the higher dimensional cases in contrast to welschinger s",
    "results @xcite .",
    "it may not neccesarily contradict his results as there may be other combinatorial ways to achieve cancellations in the general case ( as the case of @xmath25-counts ) , but for @xmath26 , the counts we define in this paper , may changes as the configuration of points passes through reducible curves in general .",
    "the argument used for @xmath24 and @xmath27 does not work because there may be too many types of reducible curves , and it is not possible to guarantee the cancellation of all strata with codimension one images with sign .",

    "we would like to thank jean - yves welschinger for explaining his results to us during his visit to northwestern university in 2004 .",
    "suppose @xmath28 satisfy the assumption given in the introduction .",
    "recall that for any @xmath0-holomorphic map @xmath29 , its conjugate @xmath0-holomorphic map is defined as @xmath30 we denote the homology classes as @xmath31 \\in h_2(m , l)$ ] , and @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "let us first recall the following proposition from @xcite , which analyzed the orientation change under the conjugation .",
    "the space of holomorphic discs were shown to be orientable in @xcite ( see the proposition [ orientspin ] ) .",
    "[ pr : signfooo ] the map @xmath33 given by @xmath34 is orientation preserving if and only if @xmath35    the sign of @xmath36 in this proposition does not incorporate the cyclic ordering factor , which we will explain later . for the definition of the moduli spaces used in this paper ,",
    "see section 7 .",
    "note the we always have a commuting diagram @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the evaluation map at the boundary marked points .",
    "therefore , the evaluation images exactly equal to each other and the difference is the orientations of the domain moduli spaces , which can be compared using the above theorem .",
    "the rought idea of the proof is as follows ( see @xcite for the exact details . ) note that the space of holomorphic discs of homotopy class @xmath39 has real ( virtual ) dimension @xmath40 , where its @xmath41-dimensional part of the tangent space of the moduli space is oriented by spin structure of @xmath2 , and the remaining part of dimension @xmath42 carry a complex orientation .",
    "then , note that the conjugation @xmath43 is orientation preserving if and only if @xmath44 mod 4 , and the conjugation @xmath45 is orientation preserving if and only if @xmath1 is even .    a good example of this is the case of @xmath46 .",
    "denote the upper - hemisphere disc by @xmath47 and the lower - hemisphere disc by @xmath2 ( their maslov indices are two ) . in @xcite , we show that for the obstruction cycle ( the case @xmath48 , hence @xmath49 ) , the contributions of @xmath47 and @xmath2 does not cancel out , and when we take the boundary of floer cohomology ( the case @xmath50 , hence @xmath51 ) , the contributions cancel out .",
    "consider the moduli space of distinct @xmath1 marked points on @xmath52 , denoted as @xmath53 .",
    "here we assume @xmath54 . here",
    "the marked points can be considered as a subset of @xmath55 modulo @xmath56 action where @xmath57 it consists of @xmath58 connected components according to the cyclic ordering of the marked points on @xmath59 , therefore the moduli space of @xmath0-holomorphic discs @xmath60 also has at least @xmath58 connected components .    as they are disconnected , there are two ways to orient the whole moduli spaces @xmath36 .",
    "one ways is to orient the marked points as a subset of @xmath61 with counterclockwise orientation on @xmath52 ( modulo @xmath62 ) .",
    "the other way is to incorporate a factor regarding the cyclic ordering of the marked points .",
    "namely , in the latter case , orientation may be defined by the following relation : for a permutation @xmath63 of @xmath64 ( for @xmath65 ) , the map @xmath66 @xmath67 is orientation preserving if and only if @xmath63 is an even permutation .",
    "this provides two different orientations on the moduli spaces @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , if we consider the count based on each orientation , we get two different signed counts of @xmath0-holomorphic discs .",
    "we will call the count , * @xmath23-count * ( resp . *",
    "@xmath25-count * ) if the orientation does not ( resp . does ) incorporate cyclic ordering factor .",
    "we remark that the cyclic ordering factor was used to in @xcite in the construction of @xmath68-algebra of lagrangian submanifolds , but it was not used in a crucial way as @xmath68 structure is constructed using the main component .    for the purpose of the @xmath25-count , it is sometimes helpful to consider each connected pieces of the moduli space @xmath36",
    "hence , we will denote by @xmath69 the connected component where the marked point are cyclically ordered counter clockwise as @xmath70 , and by @xmath71 if the marked points @xmath72 are cyclically ordered for a permutation @xmath63 of the index set @xmath73 .",
    "for any @xmath0-holomorphic disc @xmath74 passing through a given configuration of real points , the conjugate disc @xmath75 also passes through the same configuration of points .",
    "we compare the sign of intersections for @xmath74 and @xmath75 as we consider counting problems .",
    "suppose the number of @xmath0-holomorphic discs of maslov index @xmath76 passing through @xmath1 points on the real lagrangian submanifold is finite ( for a regular @xmath0 as chosen in section 7 ) .",
    "namely , we will assume that @xmath77 suppose the disc @xmath78 intersects the configuration of @xmath1 real points @xmath79 at the corresponding marked points .",
    "the case of real configuration will be carried out in section [ sec : realcf ] .",
    "we define the orientation of the intersection to be the usual preimage orientation of @xmath80 ( see @xcite chapter 3 for the standard definition of preimage orientation . )    now , for the moduli space @xmath81 , we consider @xmath82    the preimages ( [ ta ] ) and ( [ tb ] ) are the same as unoriented sets from the diagram ( [ commd ] ) . now",
    ", there may be several discs in ( [ ta ] ) but we may compare the signs at the same time because the differences of the signs only depend on the maslov indices of the maps and the number of marked points , which are fixed in this case .    for the @xmath23-count , proposition [ pr : signfooo ] can be used to deduce that ( [ ta ] ) and ( [ tb ] )",
    "have the same signed counts if and only if @xmath83 is even .    for the case of the @xmath25-count",
    ", the conjugation also changes the cyclic ordering of the marked points to the completely reverse order .",
    "this amounts to the new sign contribution @xmath84 .",
    "hence , for the @xmath25-count , ( [ ta ] ) and ( [ tb ] ) have the same signed counts if @xmath85 is even .",
    "we provide the following table according to the above criteria , and here we consider the ( mod 4 ) dimension of the lagrangian submanifold and the ( mod 4 ) number of point - intersection conditions .",
    "if ( [ ta ] ) and ( [ tb ] ) have the same orientations , then we denote by 1 and the opposite orientation by @xmath86 .",
    "we mark @xmath87 for the case which does not occur when we consider the condition ( [ eq : dim ] ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we only check the first row here , and the other rows can be done similarly .",
    "let @xmath88 for some @xmath89 , then by ( [ eq : dim ] ) , we have @xmath90 .",
    "note that @xmath1 needs to be an odd number to have @xmath76 an even number .",
    "hence , for the @xmath23-count , we have @xmath91 in the case of @xmath25-count ,",
    "@xmath92    we interpret the table in the following way .",
    "for the case the entry is @xmath93 ( for example @xmath94 ) , the signed count of real @xmath0-holomorphic discs ( or spheres ) adds up to zero , if we count holomorphic discs of both homotopy classes @xmath39 and @xmath95 . for the case",
    "the entry is @xmath96 , the signed count of real @xmath0-holomorphic discs would be twice the signed count of real @xmath0-holomorphic spheres .",
    "later , we will consider the @xmath23-count when @xmath22 and the @xmath25-count when @xmath24 .",
    "one can easily notice that in both cases , counts does not cancel out directly by the above table .",
    "let @xmath97 be a reducible real @xmath0-holomorphic disc with boundary on @xmath2 , whose domain @xmath98 consists of two disc components , denoted as @xmath99 , which intersect each other at a point .",
    "we denote the restriction of the map @xmath74 on @xmath100 as @xmath101 for @xmath102 .",
    "we denote the homology classes as @xmath103 \\in h_2(m , l),\\ ] ] and we have @xmath104 .",
    "the moduli space of such reducible curves form a codimension 1 boundary strata of the moduli space of @xmath0-holomorphic discs @xmath105 .",
    "we actually consider the case with the boundary marked points , hence the moduli space @xmath36 has codimension 1 boundary strata such as @xmath106    now , we consider the conjugate holomorphic discs of the second component of homotopy class @xmath107 ( see ( [ eq : conj ] ) for the definition ) .",
    "then , we consider the fiber product @xmath108 this can be considered as a boundary of the moduli space @xmath109 .",
    "hence , when we consider @xmath110 the above two boundary strata disappear by cancellation in mod 2 .",
    "similar cancellation occurs for @xmath111 with @xmath112 .",
    "note that there is another choice of matching them for cancellations in mod 2 , namely compare @xmath113 with @xmath114 and @xmath115 with @xmath116 .",
    "but in either way , if we consider them with orientations , they do not cancel out in general .",
    "we proceed more precisely .",
    "we have a signed formula as the following .",
    "@xmath118 which has the same @xmath119 exponent .",
    "( see [ signfb ] ) .",
    "in fact as we compare @xmath120 and @xmath109 , we need to compare connected components of different cyclic ordering because the conjugation @xmath5 on @xmath121 will change the cyclic ordering of @xmath122 component for @xmath123 .",
    "more precisely , for ( [ tta ] ) , suppose the marked points @xmath124 are cyclically ordered and they split into @xmath125 where @xmath126 denote the marked points where we glue two discs .",
    "let @xmath63 be the permutation of the index set @xmath127 which maps @xmath128 let @xmath129 be the permutation of the index set @xmath130 which sends @xmath131 then , we rewrite ( [ tta ] ) , ( [ ttb ] ) as @xmath132 @xmath133    we will see in the next section that if the left hand sides ( lhs ) of ( [ ttta ] ) and ( [ tttb ] ) cancel out with sign then we may regard that such boundary stratum do not exist .",
    "namely , as we consider cobordisms , as soon as the preimage hits a boundary stratum of a moduli space ( death ) and there should be a corresponding intersection to the pair ( birth ) and the cobordism will continue as if there was no boundary in the case that the signs are opposite to each other .",
    "it is easy to see that the cancellation of ( [ ttta ] ) and ( [ tttb ] ) is equivalent to comparing the orientations of @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "hence for the case of @xmath23-counts , they do cancel out if and only if @xmath136    for the case of @xmath25 counts , the moduli spaces are oriented differently according to the cyclic ordering , hence they do cancel out if and only if @xmath137        we remark that clearly there is an analogous story for real @xmath0-holomorphic spheres as in figure [ fig1 ] . but usually the reducible curves are not considered as boundary of the moduli spaces of real @xmath0-holomorphic curves because of this cancellation in mod 2 .",
    "but the drawback would be that the moduli space of real @xmath0-holomorphic spheres with marked points seems to be non - orientable in general from the above analysis .",
    "we define a signed count of @xmath0-holomorphic discs passing through generic real @xmath1 points and prove its independence with respect to the choice of an almost complex structure or the choice of configuration of real points with the given assumptions .",
    "first , we choose a spherical homology class @xmath138 , and we say @xmath139 if there is a holomorphic disc @xmath74 of class @xmath140 such that its complex double @xmath141 has a homology class @xmath142 .",
    "it is not hard to check that if @xmath139 , then @xmath143 also .",
    "let @xmath144 be the configuration of @xmath1 real points in @xmath2 .",
    "now we define the count of @xmath0-holomorphic discs for each @xmath138 as @xmath145 where @xmath146 or @xmath25 depending on the orientation of the moduli space of holomorphic discs .",
    "[ mainthm ] let @xmath147 satisfy the assumption given in the beginning of the paper .",
    "then , the @xmath23-count when @xmath22 or the @xmath25-count when @xmath24 of @xmath0-holomorphic discs ( hence real @xmath0-holomorphic spheres ) is invariant under the choice of a configuration of real points or the choice of a generic almost complex structure .",
    "the case of real configuration of points is proved in section 5 .    to prove the independence over the choice of @xmath1 real points , we take a path @xmath148 consider @xmath149 by choosing a generic path @xmath150",
    ", we may assume that @xmath150 is transversal to both the evaluation images of non - singular strata of @xmath36 and the images of the codimension one strata for all homotopy classes @xmath39 with @xmath139 .",
    "therefore , ( [ eq : sumbeta ] ) is a collection of one dimensional manifolds with boundaries .",
    "we will prove that the codimension one boundaries resulted from the intersection with reducible curves of ( [ eq : sumbeta ] ) cancel out , and the remaining boundaries provide the cobordism between @xmath151 and @xmath152 , hence proving the invariance of the counting .",
    "similarly to prove the independence over the choice of a generic almost complex structure , we choose a generic path @xmath153 ( see section 7 ) , and consider the moduli space @xmath154 .",
    "the possible boundaries arise when @xmath155 or @xmath156 or when disc splits into reducible discs at some time @xmath157 .",
    "again , it is enough to show that the images of the boundaries of type @xmath158 cancel out , to obtain a cobordism between the case of @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "first , we have the following lemma which we prove at the end of this section .",
    "[ signfb](cf .",
    "proposition 23.2 @xcite ) @xmath161 where @xmath162    the actual sign of this formula is not important but only the fact that it is the same for @xmath121 and @xmath107 .",
    "hence we postpone its proof to the end of this section .",
    "it is also easy to note that @xmath163    there are evaluation maps at the remaining marked points which we denote as @xmath164 @xmath165    now , the boundary contributions resulting from the reducible curves can be written as @xmath166 @xmath167    it is easy to see that the difference of the orientations of ( [ bb ] ) in the case of @xmath168 and the case of @xmath169 , is originated from the difference of orientations in @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "( note that we obtain the same ( [ bb ] ) in each case as unoriented sets . )",
    "this can be done exactly as in the previous section .",
    "the same is true for ( [ bb2 ] ) .",
    "hence the cancellation is determined by ( [ cca ] ) and ( [ ccb ] )    therefore we only need to show that these matching pairs of reducible curves are oriented in the opposite way when they contribute to the cobordisms ( [ bb ] ) or ( [ bb2 ] ) .",
    "now , we first observe that to have a nontrivial preimage either in ( [ bb ] ) or ( [ bb2 ] ) , the dimension of the moduli space @xmath172 should at least @xmath173 .",

    "in the case of @xmath23-count with @xmath22 , the both inverse images carry the same orientations since @xmath238 the last line follows from the table in section 2.3 . in the case of @xmath25-count with @xmath24 ,",
    "the both inverse image carry the same orientation as @xmath239 here we use the fact that @xmath182 for @xmath24 .",
    "hence the same table as in the section 2.3 works for these cases , which shows that the contribution from the conjugating discs do not cancel out in these cases .",
    "now , we consider the proof of the invariance of the counting .",
    "we first show that the we obtain the same inequality ( [ eq : ineq ] ) for the case relevant to the proof .",
    "suppose in the limit we have a stable disc with the domain consists of two disc components @xmath240 and @xmath241 .",
    "we assume that each component has @xmath242 interior marked points and @xmath243 boundary marked points .",
    "we consider @xmath244 .",
    "( the case we vary an almost complex structure @xmath11 can be done analogously and we omit the proof in that case ) .",
    "now , we observe as before that this stable limit curve will contribute to the counting if the image of @xmath245 is at most of codimension one .",
    "hence , we have @xmath246 note that this is the same inequality as ( [ k2eq ] ) , hence we obtain the same inequality ( [ eq : ineq ] ) .",
    "now we can show the cancellation of the image of reducible curves as in the proof of the main theorem .",
    "we compare the sign of @xmath247 and @xmath248 upon the condition ( [ eq : ineq ] ) .",
    "first , we consider the case @xmath24 .",
    "we may assume without loss of generality that @xmath183 is even and @xmath184 is odd and @xmath249 and @xmath250 .",
    "the fact that they have the opposite orientations follow from @xmath251 @xmath252 where the last equalities follow because @xmath253 is even and @xmath254 is odd .    for the case @xmath22",
    ", they still have the opposite orientations because @xmath255 hence we obtain the main theorem for the real configuration of points .",
    "in this section , we consider the count of holomorphic discs which intersect pseudo - cycles of the symplectic manfold at the fixed interior marked points and intersect real points at the boundary marked points .",
    "let @xmath256 a distinct configuration of @xmath257 points on the interior of the disc @xmath258 , which we set to be fixed interior marked points . if we do not fix interior marked points , there are too many possible strata of codimension one depending on partitions of the interior marked points into two discs . because we fix the interior marked points , all the fixed marked points stay at one disc domain in the stable limit , so that we can apply the cancellation argument of the bubble disc component as before .",
    "( see figure [ ocfig ] ) .    for the case @xmath259",
    ", we obtain what we may call real open - closed gromov - witten invariant as we may consider that the interior marked point is free . and the moduli space @xmath260 also define a pseudo - cycle modulo disc bubbling , and we will consider the obvious evaluation map @xmath261 .",
    "for the case @xmath262 , it may not be called gromov - witten type as we fix interior marked points as in @xcite .",
    "we consider evaluation maps from the space of ( parametrized ) holomorphic discs @xmath263 .",
    "note that we have an evaluation map @xmath264 given by @xmath265 where @xmath266 is the evaluation at the fixed interior marked point @xmath267 for @xmath268 and @xmath269 is an evaluation at boundary marked point @xmath270 . in general the moduli space @xmath263 with @xmath271 map",
    "does not define a pseudo - cycle ( modulo disc bubbling ) .",
    "this phenomenon was already observed in @xcite in the closed case that if we consider evaluation maps from fixed marked points , we may lose control of the positions of fixed interior marked points on the strata containing non - simple maps .",
    "but for discs , it is more serious because the structure of non - simple holomorphic disc is more complicated than that of a sphere .",
    "this will force us to make a restrictive assumption on the number of interior marked points related to the minimal chern number .",
    "this was proved in the proposition 5.1 from @xcite which is an analogue of the theorem 5.4.1 of @xcite .",
    "[ prop : pseudo ] the map @xmath271 defined as above , is a pseudo - cycle modulo disc bubbling if the number of fixed interior marked points @xmath257 satisfies @xmath272 where @xmath273 is the minimal chern number of the manifold @xmath3 .        in the proof of the proposition in @xcite , we used the fact that @xmath0 is integrable and @xmath2 is real analytic to prove that @xmath274 in the case of ( e ) .",
    "but in our case of real lagrangian submanifolds , this is satisfied without such assumptions because @xmath275 was assumed to have more than one component in the decomposition of the holomorphic disc , and the minimal maslov index of @xmath2 is the same as @xmath273 due to the involution .",
    "hence , we can define the counting as follows .",
    "we choose @xmath276 , where each @xmath277 is a pseudo - cycle of @xmath3 .",
    "we define the signed count as @xmath278 where @xmath146 or @xmath25 depending on the sign of the moduli spaces and when @xmath279 here @xmath280 if @xmath281 and @xmath282 if @xmath283 .",
    "the @xmath23-count , @xmath284 for @xmath22 or the @xmath25-count , @xmath285 for @xmath24 is independent of the choice of the pseudo - cycles @xmath286 in their bordism classes , the choice of the configuration of real points @xmath212 , the choice of a generic compatible complex structure ( with @xmath287 ) and the choice of @xmath288 , if @xmath289 where @xmath42 is the maslov index of the holomorphic disc to be counted .    as before",
    ", this is proved using the cancellation as in figure [ ocfig ] .",
    "the proof is similar to the previous cases .",
    "the analogue of the lemma [ signfb ] can be proved using lemma 7.9 of @xcite to show that orientation of the boundary strata regarding the fiber product is the same for @xmath39 and @xmath290 also in this case .",
    "now the inequality ( [ eq : ineq ] ) for the bubble component in this case turns out to be exactly the same as before as we can easily modify the previous proof by adding interior intersection conditions .",
    "hence , the cancellation with sign can be shown as before , and this proves the proposition . in the case with different almost complex structures and with the different choice of @xmath288 , the analogue of the proposition [ prop : pseudo ] can be proved , and the result follows from the same arguments .",
    "here , we state rather well - known facts about moduli space of real @xmath0-holomorphic spheres or discs .",
    "recall from @xcite that a @xmath1-dimensional pseudo - cycle in @xmath3 is a smooth map @xmath291 defined on an oriented @xmath1-dimensional manifold @xmath292 such that the @xmath293 , where @xmath294 .",
    "let @xmath295 be an oriented @xmath1-dimensional manifold @xmath295 with codimension one boundary , then we will call a smooth map @xmath296 a _ pseudo - chain _ if @xmath297 . for @xmath295 a certain moduli space of holomorphic discs",
    ", we say that a pseudo - chain @xmath298 defines a pseudo - cycle modulo disc bubbling if all the codimension one boundary @xmath299 occur due to disc bubbling phenomenons on the moduli space @xmath295 .",
    "we denote by @xmath300 the moduli space of simple real @xmath0-holomorphic spheres which preserve real structures .",
    "namely , @xmath301 satisfies @xmath302 . here",
    "@xmath138 is a spherical homology class .",
    "recall that in @xcite , it was shown that the moduli space of simple @xmath0-holomorphic spheres form a pseudo - cycle for a generic @xmath0 in the strongly semi - positive case . in the case of simple real @xmath0-holomorphic spheres ,",
    "the similar results holds in the following way .",
    "first , as shown in @xcite the linearized @xmath303 operator , @xmath304 is @xmath305-equivariant , where the actions are given by the involutions .",
    "hence for a generic @xmath0 with @xmath287 , one can show that the moduli space of simple real non - singular @xmath0-holomorphic spheres form a smooth manifold by considering the equivariant verson of the proof given in @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the case of real @xmath0-holomorphic curves , gromov - compactness , and gluing of the two real @xmath0-holomorphic curves work as in the case of @xcite .",
    "this is because the lemma 6.1.2 of @xcite can be proved @xmath305-equivariantly as @xmath304 and @xmath306 are @xmath305-equivariant .",
    "the lemma states that for the space of compatible almost complex structures @xmath307 , the evaluation map @xmath308 for a fixed @xmath309 is submersive , and it was crucially used to show that the moduli spaces form a pseudo - cycle , and to make the gluing of two @xmath0-holomorphic curves work .",
    "hence , everything mentioned above also works equally well for @xmath105 , the moduli space of @xmath5-simple @xmath0-holomorphic discs .",
    "here we call @xmath0-holomorphic disc @xmath74 , @xmath5-simple if @xmath74 is injective away from a discrete set of points in the interior of @xmath258 , and additionally , its complex double @xmath141 is a simple @xmath0-holomorphic sphere .",
    "( @xmath74 is injective at @xmath310 if @xmath311 and @xmath312 ) .",
    "this is the moduli space which is used throughout the paper .",
    "now , the proof that non - simple real @xmath0-holomorphic spheres have images of codimension two or higher seems a bit tricky , because we do not know if there is a real version of the structure theorem of @xmath0-holomorphic spheres . namely it is not clear if a non - simple real holomorphic map can be decomposed into a simple real holomorphic map composed with a real degree @xmath313 map between two @xmath314 s .",
    "( yong - geun oh informed us that they have a real version of the structure theorem of @xmath0-holomorphic spheres in the final version of @xcite ) .",
    "but by considering the moduli space of @xmath5-simple @xmath0-holomorphic discs @xmath105 and by the structure theorem of @xcite of @xmath0-holomorphic discs , it is not hard to show that the images from a non @xmath5-simple real @xmath0-holomorphic discs is codimension two or higher : for the case of non - simple @xmath0-holomorphic disc ( which does not have injective points ) , we can apply the structure theorem of @xcite directly . for the case of a @xmath0-holomorphic disc @xmath74 which is injective away from a discrete set of points at the interior but",
    "if its complex double @xmath141 is not simple , one can show that the images of @xmath74 and @xmath75 equal each other and in fact the image of @xmath74 can be considered as an image of a @xmath0-holomorphic sphere , and the domain @xmath258 of @xmath74 is decomposed to two discs by the net @xmath315 as in @xcite .",
    "hence , the images of the boundaries of such @xmath0-holomorphic discs can be covered by the images holomorphic discs with smaller maslov indices , hence their image is of codimension two or higher .",
    "hence , @xmath36 or @xmath316 with evaluation maps form the pseudo - cycle modulo disc bubbling .",
    "the case we vary an almost complex structure is similar and the stronly positivity condition implies that non - constant @xmath0-holomorphic discs with non - positive indices do not appear generically .",
    "in this section , we compare the spinor state of a real @xmath0-holomorphic sphere @xmath141 proposed by welschinger and the coherent orientation of the @xmath0-holomorphic disc @xmath74 defined by fukaya , oh , ohta and ono .",
    "but we do not know whether the welschinger invariant is the same as the signed degree defined in this paper .",
    "we assume that the real lagrangian submanifold is oriented and spin ( welschinger considers more general case when it has only pin structure ) .",
    "we recall the definition of spinor state defined by welschinger in @xcite , which was extended to general strongly positive case in @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we only consider the case @xmath317 .",
    "let @xmath318 be a @xmath305-equivariant immersion .",
    "we fix an orientation of @xmath319 , which is an immersed knot in @xmath2 . from the orientation on @xmath320 , by choosing a disc with @xmath321 , we obtain a map @xmath12 .",
    "we denote the homology class @xmath31 \\in h_2(m , l)$ ] .",
    "we have @xmath322 this provides a splitting @xmath323 .",
    "the map @xmath306 is called _ balanced _ if its normal bundle is a direct sum of isomorphic line bundles .",
    "i.e @xmath324    in this case , the projectivization of @xmath325 becomes @xmath326 .",
    "let @xmath327 and @xmath328 be the basis of @xmath329 in the splitting ( [ decom ] ) . for each @xmath203",
    ", there exists a unique holomorphic line subbundle of degree @xmath330 of @xmath325 which contains @xmath331 , which projects to a constant section in @xmath332 .",
    "this shows that @xmath333 if @xmath1 is odd , then a real line bundle @xmath334 is orientable , and hence we obtain non - vanishing sections , @xmath335 and @xmath336 of @xmath337 , which are linearly independent and which comes from holomorphic sections of @xmath325 . if @xmath1 is even , the real line bundle @xmath334 is non - orientable .",
    "but welschinger chose a real holomorphic line bundle @xmath338 in @xmath325 which has degree @xmath339 .",
    "( this maybe obtained using the half rotation on two factors of @xmath340 ) .",
    "the point is that this @xmath338 provides a real holomorphic section @xmath335 of @xmath325 , where its real part @xmath341 is orientable and @xmath342 is non - vanishing . if @xmath343 in the decomposition ( [ decom ] ) , then we set @xmath344 , which has the same properties as @xmath335 .",
    "let @xmath345 be an element of the tangent space @xmath346 which corresponds to the rotation of the domain @xmath258 at the map @xmath306 ( holomorphic vector field along the immersed know @xmath319 which is tangent to the curve ) .",
    "then , by definition , @xmath347 form a frame of @xmath348 along @xmath319 .",
    "we may assume that it also agree with the orientation of @xmath2 , replacing @xmath336 with @xmath349 if needed .",
    "the moduli space of @xmath0-holomorphic discs is orientable , if @xmath352 is a ( relatively ) spin lagrangian submanifold .",
    "furthermore the choice of ( relative ) spin structure on @xmath2 determines an orientation on @xmath353 canonically for all @xmath354 .    the proof is given by orienting the index bundle of the linearized @xmath355 operator .",
    "since the zero order term does not affect the index problem , we assume that the operator is the dolbeault operator @xmath356 . in the following proposition ,",
    "the orientation at a single disc is determined , which can be extended to the whole moduli space with the ( relative ) spin condition .",
    "( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "[ orientspin ] let @xmath357 be a complex vector bundle over a disc @xmath258 .",
    "let @xmath358 be a totally real subbundle of @xmath359 over @xmath52 .",
    "we denote by @xmath360 the dolbeault operator on @xmath258 with coefficient @xmath361 , @xmath362 assume f is trivial and take a trivialization of f over @xmath52",
    ". then the trivialization gives an orientation of the virtual vector space @xmath363    here is a proof of the proposition given in @xcite for reader s convenience .",
    "suppose that the operators are surjective .",
    "( otherwise we consider a quotient of the target by a finite dimensional complex subspace ) . by deforming the hermitian connection",
    ", we may assume that the totally real subbundle f is trivially flat and the connection is product in a collar neighborhood of @xmath52 .",
    "let @xmath364 be a concentric circle in the collar neighborhood of @xmath52 .",
    "if we pinch @xmath364 to a point , we have the union of a disc @xmath258 and a 2-sphere @xmath365 with the center @xmath366 and @xmath367 identified . by the parallel translation along radials",
    ", the trivial vector bundle f extends up to c and its complexification gives a trivialization of @xmath368 .",
    "thus the bundle descends to @xmath369 .",
    "we also denote this vector bundle by @xmath357 .",
    "then one can show that the indices of the following two operators are isomorphic to each other .",
    "@xmath370 @xmath371 @xmath372    we will get an orientation preserving isomorphism .",
    "since the real vector bundle f is trivialized , and by the above construction , the kernel of the second operator is the kernel of the homomorphism : @xmath373 note that the kernel can be oriented by the orientation of @xmath374 since @xmath375 , and @xmath376 carries a complex orientation .",
    "this proves the proposition .",
    "as the frame @xmath347 of @xmath377 is made of real holomorphic sections over @xmath365 , we can consider them as an element of the tangent space @xmath378 .",
    "therefore @xmath347 provides a trivialization of @xmath379 . note that if the homotopy class of this trivialization agrees with the trivialization of @xmath379 obtained by the given spin structure , then spinor state is @xmath350 , and otherwise @xmath86 . by @xcite ( also @xcite ) , if the homotopy classes of the trivialization is the same ( resp .",
