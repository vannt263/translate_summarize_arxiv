    "ideally one would like to benefit from the useful properties of both systems involved .",
    "in reality , the hybrid system often inherits the disadvantages of both constituents .",
    "therefore , to retain any useful quantum characteristics , we require that the coupling rate between the two systems exceeds the fastest relevant decoherence rate in both systems . additionally , we focus on specific architectures where the two technologies involved could be compatible and not preclude either of the coupled systems from being close to a pure quantum state .",
    "although we can not completely rule out all mechanisms considered here that involve an atomic ion , the analysis emphasizes how challenging it would be to incorporate one into a hybrid system at the quantum level .",

    "this conclusion changes when considering coupling a charged particle to a superconducting resonator , assuming an electron rather than an ion .",
    "this follows from the fact that for a particle of mass @xmath5 the coupling rate is proportional to @xmath6 ( see  sec .",

    "if the two oscillators have different eigen - frequencies ( @xmath82 ) their weak off - resonant coupling could be brought into a strong effective resonant coupling by modulating one or more of the system parameters by a fraction @xmath83 , at the difference frequency , @xmath84 , usually at the expense a lower coupling rate .",

    "<S> trapped charged particles have been at the forefront of quantum information processing ( qip ) for a few decades now , with deterministic two - qubit logic gates reaching record fidelities of @xmath0 and single qubit operations of much higher fidelity . in a hybrid system involving trapped charges , quantum degrees of freedom of macroscopic objects such as bulk acoustic resonators , superconducting circuits or nano - mechanical membranes , couple to </S>",
    "<S> the trapped charges and ideally inherit the coherent properties of the charges . </S>",
    "<S> the hybrid system therefore implements a  quantum transducer \" , where the quantum reality ( i.e. superpositions and entanglement ) of small objects is extended to include the larger object . </S>",
    "<S> although a hybrid quantum system with trapped charges could be valuable both for fundamental research and for qip application , no such system exists today . </S>",
    "<S> here we study theoretically the possibilities of coupling the quantum mechanical motion of a trapped charged particle ( e.g. ion or electron ) to quantum degrees of freedom of superconducting devices , nano - mechanical resonators and quartz bulk acoustic wave resonators . </S>",
    "<S> for each case , we estimate the coupling rate between the charged particle and its macroscopic counterpart and compare it to the decoherence rate , i.e. the rate at which quantum superposition decays . a hybrid system can only be considered quantum if the coupling rate significantly exceeds all decoherence rates . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is to examine specific examples , using parameters that are experimentally attainable in the foreseeable future . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that those hybrid quantum system considered involving an atomic ion are unfavorable , compared to using an electron , since the coupling rates between the charged particle and its counterpart are slower than the expected decoherence rates . a system based on trapped electrons , on the other hand , might have coupling rates which significantly exceed decoherence rates . </S>",
    "<S> moreover it might have appealing properties such as fast entangling gates , long coherence and flexible electron interconnectivity topology . </S>",
    "<S> realizing such a system , however , is technologically challenging , since it requires accommodating both trapping technology and superconducting circuitry in a compatible manner . </S>",
    "<S> we review some of the challenges involved , such as the required trap parameters , electron sources , electrical circuitry and cooling schemes in order to promote further investigations towards the realization of such a hybrid system . </S>"
