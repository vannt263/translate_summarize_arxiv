    "studying the structure of the multistep magnetization is one of the central challenge in frustrated spin systems .",
    "the most extreme example , which was shown by bak and bruinsma in 1982 , is the complete devil s staircase in the magnetization curve of the antiferromagnetic ising chain with long - range interaction@xcite .",
    "recently , we have derived exact solution of the system with multistep magnetization@xcite .",
    "we consider a frustrated ising model on diamond hierarchical lattices@xcite .",
    "the diamond hierarchical lattices are constructed via infinite iteration procedures and have vertices with coordination numbers that increase with increased stage as shown in fig.1 . thus the diamond hierarchical lattices have an inherent long - range nature .    in our study , the magnetization processes of ising models with frustration on diamond hierarchical lattices are exactly obtained at zero temperature . to define the ising model on each diamond - hierarchical lattice ,",
    "we place a ising spins , @xmath0 , on each vertex .",
    "the spins on both ends of the solid line and of the dotted line couple are represented by @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the magnetic field strength , the first sum runs over all pairs of nearest neighbors on solid bonds , and the second sum runs over all pairs on dotted bonds .",
    "the diamond unit , which is the same as the second - stage lattice , has the most frustrated ground state at @xmath7 , where the ferro- and antiferromagnetic configurations have the same energy value .     and",
    "@xmath8 represent the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic exchange interaction respectively .",
    "spins on the sites indicated by a and b are called `` top spins '' and those on the sites indicated by l and r are called `` diagonal spins '' . ]",
    "we find that the behavior changes substantially as the value of @xmath9 is varied and show that there are several types of infinitely multiple - step ( ims ) structure in a certain magnetic region . in the case of @xmath10",
    ", we have the paramagnetic phase and have independent @xmath11 pairs formed by antiferromagnetic diagonal bonds . in the case of @xmath12 , for the zero - field classical spin - liquid phase with highly developed short - range order",
    ", an infinitely small applied magnetic field can induce an infinitely small magnetization despite ising models that have discrete energy levels . by examining the structure of the partition function",
    ", we obtain the ground state spin - configurations and clarify the mechanism of the `` gapless like behavior '' .",
    "we also find that , in the antiferromagnetic case , the magnetization can not be saturated under finite magnetic fields even if the antiferromagnetic diagonal coupling vanishes . on the other hand , in the ferromagnetic case , we obtain the saturated magnetization at a finite saturation field .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 , our procedure to calculate the ground - state partition function are described .",
    "the magnetization and entropy curves are studied in sect.3 . in sect.4 , we summarize the results obtained in this study .",
    "we can write the partition function at the @xmath13-stage lattice @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are partition functions under the condition that the top spin state are , respectively , fixed to @xmath18 , @xmath11 or @xmath19 , and @xmath20 . we can write the recurrence equations @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 with @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",

    "therefore , we restrict ourselves to the absolute zero temperature and only consider the largest term in the right hand sides of the relations given in eqs.([eq:3])-([eq:5 ] ) . by repeating the recursion formula several times , and choosing the largest term , we could find simple functional relations : @xmath36 where the value of @xmath37 depends on the strength of the magnetic field and @xmath38 is function of @xmath39 , and @xmath40 @xcite .    by using the functional relations",
    ", we obtain the @xmath13-stage partition function .",
    "we concentrate on the antiferromagnetic case below .",
    "( result for the ferromagnetic case is given by @xcite . )",
    "the partition function is written by @xmath41 where @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    "furthermore , we can obtain the magnetization per spin from @xmath44 for @xmath45 $ ] and the entropy per spin from @xmath46 for @xmath47 $ ] , where @xmath48 is the site number .",
    "the partition function , which is included in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:8])-([eq:9 ] ) , is written by eq .",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) , and @xmath49 is considered to be the largest term in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) under the absolute zero temperature @xcite .",
    "in this section , we show the dependence of the magnetization and the entropy on magnetic field for the case of @xmath50 and @xmath51 in the antiferromagnet .",
    "we discuss the typical features of the resultant magnetization and entropy curve for the case of a strong af diagonal coupling , @xmath50 .",
    "we show a calculated result in fig .",

    "we have an infinitely large saturation field , i.e. , we have the ims structure around @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where @xmath56 represents the magnetic field .",
    "this high - field ims structure in the antiferromagnet originates from the competition between the nonfrustrated antiferromagnetic interaction @xmath57 and the magnetic field @xmath6 and an intrinsic long - range nature of hierarchical lattices .     and ( b ) entropy per site @xmath58 on magnetic field @xmath59 for @xmath53 .",
    "the inset shows an enlarged plot of region that are circled , where @xmath60 is the extreme left of region that are circled .",
    "the value of @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the magnetization and the entropy at @xmath63 respectively . ]    on the other hand , in the ferromagnet , we have the saturated magnetization at a finite saturation field as shown in figs .  8 and 9 in @xcite . in regions that are circled in the fig .  [ fig:3 ] ( a ) and ( b ) , other ims structures appear around @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is a critical field . in region of @xmath67 , which is the paramagnetic phase , the magnetization vanishes and",
    "the entropy is at a maximum value , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , because strong antiferromagnetic diagonal bonds form @xmath11 or @xmath19 pairs .",
    "next , we discuss the typical features of the resultant magnetization and entropy curve for the case of a weak af diagonal coupling , @xmath70 .",
    "the zero - field ground state for @xmath70 is the spin liquid state @xcite .",
    "we show a calculated result in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , where @xmath71 was chosen .",
    "we have an infinitely large saturation field or the ims structure around @xmath54 and @xmath55 , which is the same as in the previous case of @xmath52 . in regions that are circled in the fig .  [ fig:4 ] ( a ) and ( b )",
    ", the ims structures appear around @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively .",
    "it is interesting to note that an infinitely small magnetic field can induce an infinitely small magnetization , despite ising models that have discrete energy levels .    to clarify the mechanism of the above gapless like behabior , which is one of the most interesting phenomena",
    ", we return to the recursion equations ( [ eq:3])-([eq:5 ] ) and the partition function ( [ eq:6 ] ) . the coefficient of the partition function ( [ eq:6 ] ) represents the number of lattices in the @xmath13-stage lattice .",
    "thus , by obtaining the spin configurations of conditional partition functions @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 @xmath77 using the recurrence equations , and by identifying what kind of spin configurations correspond to each term of the partition function , we can elucidate the lowest - energy spin configuration . in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , we show the spin configurations in the spin liquid state .",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] that the diagonal spins of @xmath78 and @xmath79 are , respectively , @xmath20 and @xmath18 , and those of the other stages are @xmath11 . in other words ,",
    "the diagonal spins in the second stage contribute to magnetization , but those in the other stages do not . on the basis of fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , it is possible to enumerate total numbers of @xmath78 and @xmath79 in the @xmath13-stage lattice : the total number of @xmath78 is @xmath80 and that of @xmath79 is @xmath81 .     and ( b ) entropy per site @xmath58 on magnetic field @xmath59 for @xmath71 .",
    "the inset shows an enlarged plot of region that are circled , where @xmath82 is the entropy at @xmath83 . ]",
    "thus we find the magnetization is given by @xmath84 , because @xmath78 and @xmath79 has , respectively , magnetizations of @xmath85 and @xmath86 and the top spins in the @xmath13-stage lattice has that of @xmath85 .",
    "-stage lattice in the spin - liquid state .",
    "the diagonal spins of @xmath78 and @xmath79 are , respectively , @xmath20 and @xmath18 , and those of the other stages are @xmath11 . ]",
    "we here consider the case of @xmath87 to show a lowest - energy spin configuration on the real lattice and then describe how a transition of spin configurations is induced by a small magnetic field . in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] , we show the explicit spin configuration corresponding to that in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , which is denoted by @xmath88 .",
    "when the magnetic field is increased , the spin configuration @xmath88 is destabilized by the spin configuration @xmath89 defined in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] . denoting the critical field as @xmath90 , spin flips occur for the diagonal spin l ( see the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] . ) and some of its nearest neighbors connected by the solid lines at @xmath91 . at this transition ,",
    "exchange energy loss in diamond units attached to the diagonal spin l cancel each other out and the net energy loss , @xmath92 , comes from the exchange coupling between the diagonal spins l and r. ( for a general value of @xmath13 , it can be shown that @xmath93 . ) as for change in magnetization , counting the number of diagonal spin pairs with @xmath94 and @xmath95 in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] , we have @xmath96 .",
    "( for a general value of @xmath13 , it can be shown that @xmath97 . )     : the zero - field state @xmath88 and the state @xmath89 which destabilizes @xmath88 at @xmath98 .",
    "the spins denoted by l and r are diagonal spins of the 5th stage lattice .",
    "spin directions in @xmath88 are different from those in @xmath89 only for the spins surrounded by the dashed orange circle . for the other spins ,",
    "their directions are shown in the lower panel , where a , b , c , and d are 4th stage lattices constituting the 5th stage lattice in the upper panel . ]",
    "therefore , we obtain a expression for @xmath90 as follows @xmath99 thus , it is revealed that gapless like behavior originates from the fact that a large number of spins flip upwards following application of an infinitely small magnetic field , keeping the loss of exchange energy finite .",
    "we discuss why the ising model on standard lattices does not exhibit such an exotic gapless - like behavior . by examining a transition of spin configurations in the case of @xmath87",
    ", we find that spin flips occur for only the diagonal spin l and some of its nearest neighbors connected by the solid lines .",
    "this means that the spin with the largest coordination number , and some of its nearest neighbors flip upwards .",
    "this holds for the general value @xmath100 , and but @xmath101 , it does not because of the small coordination number , which indicates that a large coordination number , or a long - range interaction , is an essential role of the gapless - like behavior .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the appearance of the ims structure around @xmath72 and that of the gapless - like behavior come from the combination of an inherent long - range nature of hierarchical lattices and the frustration effect of diamond structures .",
    "magnetization processes of ising models with frustration on diamond hierarchical lattices are exactly obtained at absolute zero temperature . in this paper , we discuss only the antiferromagnetic case .",
    "our hierarchical lattice has vertices whose coordination numbers increase whenever the stage goes up , so we can regard this behavior as an intrinsic long - range nature , to which the appearance of the ims structure can be ascribed .",
    "one of the most interesting phenomena is that applying a infinitely small magnetic field on the spin liquid phase gives an infinitely small magnetization ; the ims structure around @xmath102 appears . by analyzing the structure of the recursion equations and the partition function , we can elucidate the lowest - energy spin configuration and clarify the origin of the spin - liquid ground state .",
