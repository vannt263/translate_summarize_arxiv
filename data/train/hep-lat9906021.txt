    "the numerical simulation of lattice fermions is a notoriously difficult problem which is the major stumbling block in solving qcd and other fermionic field theories .",
    "the standard method is to integrate out the fermions and to simulate the resulting bosonic problem with a non - local action . in several cases of physical interest",
    " for example , for qcd with an odd number of flavors or with non - zero chemical potential  the bosonic boltzmann factor may become negative or even complex and thus can not be interpreted as a probability .",
    "when the sign or the complex phase of the boltzmann factor is included in measured observables , the numerical simulation suffers from severe cancellations resulting in a sign problem .",
    "the standard fermion algorithms are incapable of exploring such models . as a consequence",
    ", qcd is usually simulated with an even number of flavors and at zero chemical potential . even in the absence of a sign problem",
    ", the simulation of fermions is difficult .",
    "for example , lattice qcd simulations suffer from critical slowing down when one approaches the chiral limit in which the quarks become massless .",
    "in particular , this makes it difficult to identify the universality class of the finite temperature qcd chiral phase transition .    even in simpler models with four - fermion interactions",
    "the identification of the finite temperature critical behavior is a non - trivial issue @xcite .",
    "a model with @xmath2 fermion flavors shows mean - field behavior in the @xmath3 limit . on the other hand , at finite @xmath2",
    "one finds the non - trivial critical behavior that one expects based on dimensional reduction and standard universality arguments .",
    "for example , in @xcite it has been verified that the chiral phase transition in a @xmath4-d four - fermion model with @xmath5 and @xmath1 chiral symmetry is in the universality class of the 2-d ising model . due to the fermion sign problem",
    ", standard fermion simulation methods often do not work in models with a too small number of flavors .",
    "in this paper we apply a recently developed technique @xcite for solving the sign problem to a @xmath0-d model of staggered fermions using the hamiltonian formulation .",
    "the model has @xmath6 flavors and a @xmath1 chiral symmetry that is spontaneously broken at low temperatures .",
    "the fermion determinant can be negative in this model .",
    "hence , due to the sign problem standard fermion algorithms fail in this case .",
    "our algorithm is the only numerical method available to simulate this model . in this method",
    "we do not integrate out the fermions but describe them in a fock state basis .",
    "the resulting bosonic model of fermion occupation numbers interacts locally , but has a non - local fermion permutation sign resulting from the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "standard numerical methods would suffer from severe cancellations of positive and negative contributions to the partition function .",
    "like other cluster methods , our algorithm decomposes a configuration of fermion occupation numbers into clusters which can be flipped independently . under a cluster flip",
    "an occupied site becomes empty and vice versa .",
    "the main idea of the meron - cluster algorithm is to construct the clusters such that they affect the fermion sign independent of each other when they are flipped .",
    "in addition , it must always be possible to flip the clusters into a reference configuration with a positive sign .",
    "a cluster whose flip changes the fermion sign is referred to as a meron because it can be viewed as a half - instanton . if a configuration contains a meron - cluster , its contribution to the partition function is canceled by the contribution of the configuration that one obtains when the meron - cluster is flipped . the observables that we consider get non - zero contributions from the zero- and two - meron sectors only .",
    "our algorithm ensures that configurations with more than two merons are never generated , which leads to an exponential gain in statistics and to a complete solution of the sign problem .    like other cluster algorithms",
    "the meron algorithm substantially reduces critical slowing down .",
    "this allows us to work directly in the chiral limit . as a result",
    ", we can study the nature of the chiral phase transition in great detail .",
    "the @xmath1 chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken at low temperatures and gets restored in the high - temperature phase . as expected , the system close to the finite temperature critical point is in the universality class of the 3-d ising model .",
    "we verify this in a high - precision finite - size scaling investigation of the chiral susceptibility .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the staggered fermion hamiltonian , derive the path integral representation of the partition function , and discuss the fermion sign as well as relevant observables .",
    "section 3 contains the description of the meron - cluster algorithm and the corresponding improved estimators . in section 4 , we present the results of numerical simulations and extract the critical behavior from the finite - size scaling of the chiral susceptibility .",
    "finally , section 5 contains our conclusions .",
    "let us consider staggered fermions hopping on a 3-d cubic spatial lattice with @xmath7 sites @xmath8 ( @xmath9 even ) and with periodic or antiperiodic spatial boundary conditions .",
    "we start in the hamiltonian formulation and then derive a path integral on a @xmath0-d euclidean space - time lattice .",
    "the fermions are described by creation and annihilation operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 with standard anticommutation relations @xmath12 the staggered fermion hamilton operator takes the form @xmath13 that is a sum of nearest - neighbor couplings @xmath14 and a mass term @xmath15 . in the following we work directly in the chiral limit , @xmath16 , and only use @xmath17 as an observable . the term @xmath14 couples the fermion operators at the lattice sites @xmath8 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a unit - vector in the @xmath20-direction , and @xmath21 here @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the standard staggered fermion sign factors , and @xmath25 is a four - fermion coupling constant .",

    "besides the @xmath28 fermion number symmetry , the model has a @xmath1 chiral symmetry , which ( up to a phase ) simply shifts @xmath10 and @xmath11 by one lattice spacing in all three directions .",

    "there are also other @xmath1 symmetries which correspond to discrete flavor transformations . for a detailed discussion of the symmetries of staggered fermions in the hamiltonian formulation",

    "the contributions to @xmath68 $ ] are @xmath45 from configurations containing meron - clusters and @xmath46 from configurations without merons . according to the previous discussion ,",
    "this solves one half of the fermion sign problem .",
    "let us describe how one can make sure that a configuration without merons always has @xmath68 = 1 $ ] .",
    "this is possible when one does not allow the cluster break - ups characterized by the amplitudes @xmath106 and @xmath108 in eq.([cluster ] ) .",
    "this again limits us to models with @xmath124 , for which we have @xmath142 according to eq.([solution1 ] ) .",
    "the remaining cluster break - ups with amplitudes @xmath143 have a very important property .",
    "they guarantee that sites inside a cluster obey a pattern of staggered occupation , i.e. either the even sites ( with @xmath144 even ) within the cluster are all occupied and the odd sites are all empty , or the even sites are all empty and the odd sites are all occupied .",
    "this guarantees that the clusters can be flipped such that one reaches the totally staggered reference configuration in which at all times all even sites are occupied and all odd sites are empty . in the corresponding antiferromagnet",
    "this configuration represents a completely ordered state with a staggered magnetization . in the half - occupied reference configuration ( which is the first configuration in figure 1 ) all fermions are at rest ,",
    "no fermions are permuted during the euclidean time evolution , and thus @xmath68 = 1 $ ] . since",
    "any configuration can be turned into the reference configuration by appropriate cluster flips , this is particularly true for configurations without merons .",
    "since the totally staggered configuration has @xmath68 = 1 $ ] and the fermion sign remains unchanged when a non - meron - cluster is flipped , all configurations without merons have @xmath68 = 1 $ ] .",
    "instead of a sequence of @xmath141 for @xmath68 $ ] , we now have contributions @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "as discussed before , this only solves one half of the fermion sign problem .",
    "before we can solve the other half of the problem we must discuss improved estimators for the physical observables .",
    "let us consider an improved estimator for @xmath145)^2 { \\mbox{sign}}[n]$ ] which is needed to determine the chiral susceptibility @xmath146 .",
    "the total chiral condensate , @xmath147 = \\sum_c { \\overline{\\psi } \\psi}_c$ ] , is a sum of cluster contributions @xmath148 when a cluster is flipped , its condensate contribution changes sign . in a configuration without merons , where @xmath68 = 1 $ ] for all relative cluster flips , the average of @xmath145)^2 { \\mbox{sign}}[n]$ ] over all @xmath139 configurations is @xmath149 . for configurations with two merons",
    "the average is @xmath150 where @xmath151 and @xmath152 are the two meron - clusters .",
    "configurations with more than two merons do not contribute to @xmath145)^2   { \\mbox{sign}}[n]$ ] .",
    "the improved estimator for the susceptibility is hence given by @xmath153 where @xmath2 is the number of meron - clusters in a configuration .",
    "thus , to determine @xmath146 one must only sample the zero- and two - meron sectors .    the probability to find a configuration without merons is exponentially small in the space - time volume since it is equal to @xmath154 .",
    "thus , although we have increased the statistics tremendously with the improved estimators , without a second step one would still need an exponentially large statistics to accurately determine @xmath146 .",
    "fortunately , the numerator in equation ( [ chi ] ) receives contributions from the zero- and two - meron sectors only , while the denominator gets contributions only from the zero - meron sector .",
    "one can hence restrict oneself to the zero- and two - meron sectors and never generate configurations with more than two merons .",
    "this enhances both the numerator and the denominator by a factor that is exponentially large in the volume , but leaves the ratio of the two invariant .",
    "one purpose of the second step of the meron - cluster algorithm is to eliminate all configurations with more than two merons . to achieve this , we start with an initial configuration with zero or two merons . for example",
    ", a completely occupied configuration has no merons .",
    "we then visit all plaquette interactions one after the other and choose new pair connections between the four sites according to the above cluster rules . if the new connection increases the number of merons beyond two , it is not accepted and the old connection is kept for that plaquette .",
    "this procedure obeys detailed balance because configurations with more than two merons do not contribute to the observable we consider .",
    "this simple reject step eliminates almost all configurations with weight @xmath45 and is the essential step to solve the other half of the fermion sign problem .    assuming a dilute gas of meron and non - meron - clusters of typical space - time volume @xmath155 one finds a ratio @xmath156 of the probabilities @xmath157 and @xmath158 to have zero or two merons .",
    "hence , as long as the cluster size does not grow with the space - time volume , most configurations would have two merons and therefore would still have weight @xmath45 . without further improvements , one would still need statistics quadratic ( but no longer exponential ) in the space - time volume to get an accurate average sign .",
    "the remaining problem can be solved with a reweighting technique similar to the one used in @xcite . to enhance the zero - meron configurations in a controlled way , we introduce trial probabilities @xmath159 and @xmath160 which determine the relative weight of the zero- and two - meron sector",
    ". the trial distribution @xmath161 for @xmath162 is set to infinity .",
    "the distribution @xmath161 is used in a metropolis accept - reject step for the newly proposed pair connection on a specific plaquette interaction .",
    "a new pair connection that changes the meron number from @xmath2 to @xmath163 is accepted with probability @xmath164 $ ] .",
    "in particular , configurations with @xmath165 are never generated because then @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "after visiting all plaquette interactions , each cluster is flipped with probability @xmath79 which completes one update sweep .",
    "after reweighting , the zero- and two - meron configurations appear with similar probabilities .",
    "this completes the second step in our solution of the fermion sign problem .",
    "the reweighting of the zero- and two - meron configurations is taken into account in the final expression for the chiral susceptibility as @xmath168 the optimal ratio @xmath169 , which minimizes the statistical error of @xmath146 , can be estimated by gradually increasing the volume and the inverse temperature to their desired values .",
    "we have simulated the staggered fermion model with @xmath80 on antiperiodic spatial volumes @xmath170 with @xmath171 and at various inverse temperatures @xmath172 $ ] which includes the critical point . in the euclidean time direction",
    "we have used @xmath173 , i.e. 24 time - slices . in all cases ,",
    "we have performed at least 1000 thermalization sweeps followed by 10000 measurements .",
    "one sweep consists of a new choice of the cluster connections on each interaction plaquette and a flip of each cluster with probability @xmath79 . to estimate an optimal ratio @xmath169 of the reweighting probabilities ,",
    "we have first performed runs without reweighting .",
    "the observed relative probabilities of the zero- and two - meron sectors were used as an estimate for @xmath169 in production runs . especially for the larger volumes ,",
    "reweighting is necessary in order to obtain accurate results .",
    "some of our data for the chiral susceptibility @xmath146 are contained in table 2 .",
    "the table also includes the non - reweighted @xmath154 , the value of the used reweighting factor @xmath169 as well as the reweighted @xmath174 .",
    "._numerical results for the non - reweighted @xmath154 , the reweighted @xmath174 and @xmath146 obtained with a reweighting factor @xmath169 on lattices of spatial size @xmath9 at inverse temperature @xmath33 . for the larger volumes",
    "the non - reweighted @xmath154 is too small to be measured .",
    "_ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     note that @xmath174 is the fraction of zero - meron configurations that the algorithm generates by sampling the zero- and two - meron sectors only .",
    "this quantity is typically a lot bigger than the original non - reweighted @xmath154 , which is the fraction of zero - meron configurations in the space of all configurations including those with many merons . in particular , in large space - time volumes the staggered fermion model suffers from a very severe sign problem .",
    "figure 3 shows the probability to have a certain number of merons in an algorithm that samples all meron - sectors without reweighting . for small volumes the zero - meron sector and",
    "hence @xmath154 are relatively large , while multi - meron configurations are rare . on the other hand , in larger volumes",
    "the vast majority of configurations has a large number of merons and hence @xmath154 is exponentially small .",
    "for example , an extrapolation from smaller volumes gives a rough estimate for the non - reweighted @xmath175 on the @xmath176 lattice at @xmath177 , while the reweighted @xmath178 .",
    "hence , to achieve a similar accuracy without the meron - cluster algorithm one would have to increase the statistics by a factor @xmath179 , which is obviously impossible in practice .",
    "in fact , at present there is no other method that can be used to simulate this model .",
    "figure 4 shows the chiral susceptibility @xmath146 as a function of @xmath33 for various spatial sizes @xmath9 . at high temperatures ( small @xmath33 )",
    "@xmath146 is almost independent of the volume , indicating that chiral symmetry is unbroken . on the other hand , at low temperatures",
    "@xmath146 increases with the volume , which implies that chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken .    to study the critical behavior in detail ,",
    "we have performed a finite - size scaling analysis for @xmath146 focusing on a narrow range @xmath180 $ ] around the critical point . since a @xmath1 chiral symmetry gets spontaneously broken at finite temperature in this @xmath0-d model ,",
    "one expects to find the critical behavior of the 3-d ising model .",
    "the corresponding finite - size scaling formula valid close to @xmath181 is @xcite @xmath182 for the 3-d ising model the critical exponents are given by @xmath183 and @xmath184 @xcite .",
    "fitting our data , we find @xmath185 and @xmath186 , which indicates that the chiral transition of the staggered fermion model is indeed in the 3-d ising universality class .",
    "the fit gives @xmath187 . in figure 5",
    "we have taken the values of the critical exponents from the 3-d ising model , and we have plotted @xmath188 as a function of @xmath189 . for large enough @xmath9",
    "one can neglect the term @xmath190 in eq.([scaling ] ) and one obtains @xmath191 .",
    "we have varied the value of @xmath181 and found that indeed all data can be collapsed on one universal curve .",
    "the resulting critical inverse temperature is @xmath187 in agreement with the previous fit .    at the estimated value of @xmath181",
    ", we have performed simulations on larger spatial volumes up to @xmath176 .",
    "the results for @xmath146 are shown in figure 6 together with a fit that gives an independent estimate of @xmath186 .",
    "all of this supports the claim that the chiral transition in our model is ising - like .",
    "we have applied a new fermion simulation technique  the meron - cluster algorithm  to a model of staggered fermions .",
    "in contrast to standard methods which integrate out the fermions and are left with a non - local bosonic action , we describe the fermions in a fock state occupation number basis and thus keep a local bosonic action .",
    "the fermion permutation sign arises due to the pauli exclusion principle as a non - local factor associated with non - trivial topology of the fermion world - lines .",
    "the sign leads to severe cancellations which makes standard simulation techniques impossible to use .",
    "the decomposition of a configuration into clusters allows us to disentangle the complicated topology of the fermion world - lines .",
    "in particular , a meron - cluster identifies a pair of configurations with equal weight and opposite sign .",
    "this results in an explicit cancellation of two contributions @xmath141 to the path integral , such that only the zero - meron sector contributes to the partition function .",
    "observables like the chiral susceptibility @xmath146 receive contributions only from the zero- and two - meron sectors . to measure @xmath146 one can hence eliminate all sectors with more than two merons , which leads to an exponential gain in statistics and to a complete solution of the fermion sign problem",
    ".    the meron - cluster algorithm allowed us to simulate a staggered fermion model for which standard fermion methods suffer from a severe sign problem .",
    "the model has two flavors and a @xmath1 chiral symmetry which is spontaneously broken at low temperatures . applying finite - size scaling methods to the high - precision numerical data for the chiral susceptibility",
    ", we extracted critical exponents compatible with those of the 3-d ising model .",
    "this is the expected behavior based on universality arguments and dimensional reduction .",
    "it would be interesting to apply our method to @xmath4 dimensions .",
    "the @xmath5 flavor case was studied in @xcite and it was verified that the model is in the 2-d ising universality class .",
    "the standard fermion algorithm that was used in that study does not work for @xmath192 due to the fermion sign problem .",
    "the meron - cluster algorithm solves the sign problem and can be used to explore those models .    even in cases without a sign problem , the meron - cluster algorithm is more efficient than standard fermion simulation methods .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that the meron - cluster algorithm is not always applicable .",
    "for example , the meron concept applies only when the clusters are independent in their effect on the fermion sign .",
    "in addition , it must always be possible to flip the clusters such that one reaches a reference configuration with a positive sign .",
    "otherwise , some contributions from the zero - meron sector could be negative .",
    "for example , in our model these restrictions led to @xmath124 , i.e. to a sufficiently strong four - fermion coupling . in this paper",
    ", we have not attempted to take the continuum limit of the lattice theory .",
    "instead , we have studied the chiral phase transition at a finite lattice spacing corresponding to @xmath80 .",
    "the restriction @xmath124 would prevent us from approaching the continuum limit if it corresponds to @xmath193 .",
    "it should be pointed out that we can study the universal behavior of the chiral transition without taking the continuum limit .",
    "of course , it is not excluded that appropriate modifications of the algorithm might allow us to work at @xmath194 .",
    "a natural arena for applications of the meron - cluster algorithm are quantum link models @xcite which are used in the d - theory formulation of qcd @xcite . in d - theory continuous classical fields arise from the dimensional reduction of discrete quantum variables . in these models",
    "the continuum limit is approached by varying the extent of an extra dimension , not by varying the value of a bare coupling constant .",
    "hence , restrictions such as @xmath124 would not prevent us from taking the continuum limit . in quantum link qcd the quarks arise as domain wall fermions .",
    "the application of meron - cluster algorithms to domain wall fermions is in progress .",
    "also there are many applications to sign problems in condensed matter physics .",
    "investigations of antiferromagnets in a magnetic field and of systems in the hubbard model family will be reported elsewhere .    at present , the meron - cluster algorithm is the only method that allows us to solve the fermion sign problem .",
    "a severe sign problem arises in lattice qcd calculations at non - zero baryon number due to a complex action .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask if our algorithm can be applied to this case . at non - zero chemical potential",
    "the 2-d @xmath135 model , which is a toy model for qcd , also suffers from a sign problem due to a complex action .",
    "when applied to the d - theory formulation of this model , the meron - cluster algorithm solves the sign problem completely .",
