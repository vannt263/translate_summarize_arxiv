    "the direct detection of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimp )  @xcite and the search for neutrinoless double - beta ( @xmath1 ) decay  @xcite are fundamentally important for physics beyond the standard model of particle physics .",
    "the direct detection of wimps would help to determine the mass and cross section of a wimp , while any observation of neutrinoless double - beta decay would clearly show that the neutrino is a majorana particle and that the lepton number is not conserved .",
    "both types of experiments are searches for extremely rare signals and thus require large mass exposures of sensitive detectors with small internal backgrounds and sufficient shielding against external backgrounds at a deep underground site .",
    "the physics goals of upcoming double - beta decay experiments are to probe the quasi - degenerate neutrino mass region as low as 100 mev and demonstrate that backgrounds can be achieved at or below 1 count / ton / year in the @xmath1 decay peak region of interest ( roi ) .",
    "to realize these goals , these experiments must construct detectors in an ultra - low background structure  @xcite .",
    "although these experiments are foremost neutrino mass experiments , they may potentially contribute to dark matter searches  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , dark matter experiments will not necessarily be built of a material composed of @xmath1 isotope . in any case ,",
    "cosmic - ray produced long - lived isotopes are potential sources of background for either type of experiment .",
    "in this paper , we revisit old calculations of the production rates for critical cosmic - ray produced isotopes .",
    "the need for this revisit arises , because of recent improvements in the understanding of the cosmic - ray neutron flux and , in the case of @xmath2h , the availability of reaction codes that fully identify all the reaction products in the final state . in section  [ sec : bkg ] we evaluate , several long - lived isotopes that are produced in germanium by cosmic ray neutrons while the material resides on the earth s surface .",
    "we then validate our calculation by comparing them to the measured production rates in section  [ sec : sens ] .",
    "we discuss the effect of cosmogenic activation of natural xenon and various other targets on dark matter detection in section  [ sec : xe ] .",
    "finally , we give our conclusions in section  [ sec : con ] .",
    "the early work of avignone _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that isotopes produced in ge by fast cosmic - ray neutrons could create background in double beta decay and dark matter experiments .",
    "both the heidelberg - moscow  @xcite and igex  @xcite experiments observed @xmath3-rays from such isotopes ( e.g. @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) .",
    "thus , motivated the need to limit the cosmogenic activation , a better understanding of the production rate of cosmogenic isotopes is required .",
    "the production rate , @xmath6 , of the radioactive isotope @xmath7 can be calculated according to @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number of target nuclear isotope @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the neutron excitation function for the product @xmath7 from target @xmath10 , and @xmath12 is the cosmic neutron flux .",
    "we ignore the contribution of cosmic protons because the flux is much smaller .",
    "ziegler carried out a comprehensive study on neutron cosmic ray flux  @xcite and pointed out that some of the data from early measurements  @xcite is incorrect or of marginal quality  @xcite .",
    "several cosmic neutron fluxes  @xcite were used in the evaluation of cosmogenic production in both natural germanium and enriched @xmath13ge conducted by avignone _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite while significant differences emerged in the production rate of @xmath14ge and @xmath15co due to the varying values for the cosmic neutron flux .",
    "the quality of the neutron flux data has significantly improved due to new measurements  @xcite . improved recent measurements by gordon _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite show that the flux density spectrum at sea level can be parametrized as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is neutron kinetic energy in mev and @xmath12 in units of @xmath18s@xmath19mev@xmath19 .",
    "this parametrization function agrees with the data within @xmath202% accuracy as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : com ] .",
    "note that the variation of the cosmic ray muon and neutron fluxes at various locations around world have been reported by ziegler  @xcite and gordon _ et al . _",
    "cosmic ray muon and neutron fluxes depend strongly on the altitude and the variation is described as a function of altitude in ziegler s paper  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the variation from different locations at the sea level caused by geomagnetic rigidity is also substantial  @xcite . in the northern hemisphere",
    ", this variation is within 10%  @xcite .",
    "this work applies the measured cosmic ray neutron flux in the northern hemisphere described in eq.([eq : flux ] ) .",
    "we use the talys code 1.0  @xcite to generate the excitation functions of isotopes produced by neutrons on stable isotopes of germanium and copper .",
    "talys is a nuclear reaction program which simulates nuclear reactions that involve neutrons , photons , protons , deuterons , tritons , @xmath21he- and alpha - particles , for target nuclides of mass 12 and heavier . in the talys code",
    "1.0 , a suite of nuclear - reaction models has been implemented into a single code system which enables to evaluate nuclear reactions from the unresolved - resonance region up to intermediate energies .",
    "we show , for example , the excitation functions of @xmath5 and @xmath0 by neutrons on germanium isotopes in fig .",
    "[ fig : co60 ] and  [ fig : h3 ] , respectively . based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : rate ] ) , the production rates of cosmogenic isotopes in natural and enriched ( nominally 86% @xmath22 and 14% @xmath23 ) germanium are estimated and tabulated in table  [ tab : rate ] .",
    "isotopes with half - lives above 10,000 years are not listed because their contribution to the backgrounds are expected to be negligible due to their low decay rate .",
    "the production rates of @xmath5 and @xmath4 in germanium agree within a factor of 2 with ref .",
    "@xcite , while the rate of @xmath0 is a factor of 7 smaller than the estimates in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the old cosmic neutron flux from ref .",
    "@xcite or  @xcite is used .",
    "compared to the old neutron - flux measurements , the recently measured flux is smaller at energies below 50 mev , but larger between 50 mev and 1 gev .",
    "@xmath0 can produce background for dark matter detection via @xmath24-decay with an end point at 18.6 kev .",
    ".the calculated production rates ( per day per kg ) of cosmogenic isotopes in natural and enriched ( 86% @xmath22 and 14% @xmath23 ) germanium using tayls and the neutron flux model described in the text . very long and short lived isotopes are not listed because their contribution to the backgrounds are expected to be negligible .",
    "also shown are isotopes which are produced by cosmogenic activation of copper .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , > , > , > , > \" , ]     [ tab : h3 ]    it is worthwhile to mention that it has been demonstrated that liquid argon can achieve a pulse shape discrimination power of @xmath25 against electronic recoil events at energy of 15 kev  @xcite .",
    "thus , at such a high energy threshold , the cosmogenic @xmath0 will not be a problem for lar - based dark matter detection and the dominant background source will be @xmath26 contained in natural argon .",
    "we have investigated the cosmogenic production of various isotopes in several target or source materials pertinent for dark matter and double - beta decay experiments . the tritium production in these materials due to",
    "cosmic - ray neutrons is substantial and steps must be taken to either reduce exposure of the target to cosmic rays , reduce the resultant @xmath2h within the target after exposure , or develop an event - by - event analysis to remove @xmath2h decay events from the data stream .",
