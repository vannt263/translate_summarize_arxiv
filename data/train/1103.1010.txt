    "otherwise , since @xmath154 , our key information implies that the vertices @xmath125 and @xmath74 belong to the same half space with respect to @xmath84 .",
    "but it is contradictory to claim ( ii ) .",
    "therefore @xmath152 should belong to the shaded region in figure [ fig4]-(c ) , which implies that @xmath155 intersect both @xmath116 and @xmath156 .",

    "it can be known that @xmath128 , @xmath109 and @xmath105 are the only edges which may penetrate @xmath161 . but looking into figure [ fig4]-(d ) we can exclude the first two candidates . and also the third is excluded , because @xmath105 passes over both @xmath149 and @xmath102 .",
    "now we exclude all hamiltonian cycles of @xmath2 which contain any triple in @xmath162 as consecutive three vertices , because such cycles are not figure-8 as mentioned in the previous section . in the case",

    "then , since the vertex @xmath74 is above the vertex @xmath73 , we obtain another image representing a trefoil knot .    in the case that @xmath168 , seven heptagons remain : @xmath169 figure [ fig6 ] shows their images under @xmath99 .",
    "the polygons @xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath172 were perturbed slightly so that the vertices @xmath73 and @xmath74 are projected to different points . as shown in the figure",
    "@xmath173 is a trefoil knot , and @xmath170 can be isotoped to a polygon representing trefoil . for @xmath171",
    "we need to recall @xmath92 and @xmath100 , which implies that @xmath174 passes over both @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "hence @xmath101 and @xmath102 can be isotoped so that the resulting heptagon has exactly two double points with respect to @xmath99 .",
    "therefore @xmath171 is a trivial knot .",
    "also @xmath175 can be isotoped to a octagon which has three double points , which implies that it is either a trefoil knot or a trivial knot .",

    "we suppose that @xmath36 is of type - ii . and @xmath176 is assumed to be @xmath177 .",
    "note that the table type - ii is almost identical with type - i .",
    "the only difference is that @xmath178 is @xmath106 in type - ii .",
    "therefore , following the procedure in the previous section , we can find out a set of trivial triples @xmath179 which is almost same with the set @xmath162 .",
    "the only difference is that @xmath179 does not include @xmath180 .",
    "@xmath181    also in the same way with the previous section , the image @xmath182 can be obtained .",
    "we observe the image more concretely .",
    "if @xmath152 does not belong to @xmath153 , then @xmath155 should intersect @xmath116 and @xmath156 as shown in the left of figure [ fig7]-(a ) .",
    "since @xmath101 does not penetrate @xmath110 and passes under @xmath111 , the edge should pass under @xmath149 .",
    "in addition @xmath105 should pass under @xmath149 so that @xmath178 is @xmath106 , because @xmath183 is @xmath50 , that is , the vertex @xmath74 is above the plane @xmath84 with respect to the @xmath97-coordinate .",
    "the right of figure [ fig7]-(a ) shows the resulting image of @xmath184 .",

    "construct their images by using @xmath119 .",
    "then , irrespective of the position of @xmath152 , the resulting images are same with those in the previous section .",
    "therefore the last two polygons can be shown to be trefoil knots .    in the case",
