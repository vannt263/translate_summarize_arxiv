    "there is a growing attention in recent years to the physics of martensitic phase transformations in metal alloys@xcite , though these phenomena were known by materials scientists for many years as diffusionless transformations characterized by specific transformation kinetics@xcite not described by the classical nucleation theory@xcite .",
    "two different kinds of martensitic transformations are known , i.e. , an athermal and isothermal ones . in the athermal case",
    "the transformation begins at some start temperature @xmath1 , but the parent phase still exists until the temperature goes down to @xmath2 - a martensite finish point . in the isothermal case the transformation proceeds in time at a constant temperature and , generally speaking , could be completed in some finite time , which might be very long and depends in turn on temperature .",
    "there is a particular sub - class of a so - called `` thermo - elastic '' martensite within this class of transformation , which is characterized by the reversibility of a structure change - the alloy regains its high - temperature structure upon heating from a martensitic low - temperature state through the transition point .",
    "this means that the lattice of product phase is coherent with respect to the parent one .",
    "this phenomenon gives the ground for the `` shape - memory effect''@xcite and is , thus , of a great practical importance .",
    "due to a spontaneous strain release during the transformation some elastic distortions appear in the matrix of the parent phase surrounding the martensite nuclei .",
    "the minimization of elastic long - range energy determines the shape of new phase precipitates and provides an equilibrium state that has complicated heterogeneous structure which involves multiple - twin bands for deeper relaxation of the elastic strain@xcite .",
    "thus , a real development of transformation takes place in complicated conditions of _ apriory _ unknown external pressure from the lattice of the parent phase upon the regions under transformations .",
    "thus , the heterogeneity of the system makes it difficult to analyze the thermodynamic of phase transition , and idealized single - crystal systems should be considered in order to study an equilibrium structure of the martensite phase as well as an equilibrium development of the transformation .",
    "the reversibility of the transformation means that a phase transition between equilibrium phases takes place and the structure coherence as well as the symmetry breaking at a critical temperature implies that the transition can be analyzed within the frame of the landau theory . in this approach",
    "the difference in free energy between the parent and product phase is considered as a function of some order parameter which is equal to zero in a high - temperature symmetrical phase and becomes non - vanishing below the critical temperature@xcite .",
    "the fundamental difference of the structure of a martensitic phase with respect to the parent lattice is well known to be spontaneous strain@xcite , so this phase transition belongs to the class of proper ferroelastics@xcite .",
    "it means that the structure change takes place through the elastic instability of the crystalline lattice of a parent high - temperature phase with respect to a spontaneous homogeneous strain of a special kind@xcite . in other words",
    ", some combination of the elastic modulii vanishes at the critical temperature .",
    "it gives rise to the drastic lowering of the frequency of a corresponding mode of the acoustic vibration leading to a central peak of the inelastic neutron scattering@xcite and this is the reason why this sort of phase transition is often referring to as a `` soft - mode '' one .",
    "though , the modes never become completely soften@xcite and a finite ( albeit  small ) jump of the order parameter is usually observed , the martensitic phase transition still may be treated as a weakly - discontinuous and considered in the frame of the landau theory of a continuous phase transition .",
    "a corresponding ginzburg - landau expansion of the free energy in series of the symmetrized strain components has been developed@xcite and the heterogeneous fluctuations@xcite , nucleation of the martensite phase around the defects@xcite and some other phenomena@xcite were studied in such a formalism .    in the present paper the role of hydrostatic strain in the martensitic phase transitions is considered for the case of a cubic lattice of a high - temperature phase .",
    "a cubic point symmetry leads to a coupling between the shear strain and volume change in the elastic energy expansion near the critical temperature , and the volume change can be considered as an additional order parameter not related with the symmetry breaking .",
    "the coupling is shown to lead to the transition anomaly in the thermal expansion coefficient as well as in the isothermal compressibility . for the case of the first - order transition",
    "some effect is found to occur in the low - temperature phase even at the temperature region outside fluctuation - induced singularities .",
    "the effect of the uniaxial pressure , that preserves the symmetry of the low - temperature tetragonal phase is studied as well .",
    "it is an external field conjugated to the order - parameter which is known@xcite to suppress the continuous ( second - order ) phase transition for arbitrary small field value , however , the weakly - discontinuous transition is preserved under the field lower than the critical one . the dependence of the transition temperature on the external uniaxial as well as hydrostatic pressure is derived and the critical pressure is found .",
    "the non - linear analysis of the volume change shows , that the elastic energy minimization can provide the fcc structure of low - temperature phase for the bcc parent lattice through the special relationship between the shear strain and volume change .",
    "hence , non - linear elastic effects might be responsible for the challenging fcc ",
    "bcc martensitic transformation in pure iron and some ferrous alloys .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "a brief description of a weakly - first - order transition within the landau theory is a content of the section [ glt ] .",
    "the landau theory of a proper ferroelastic ( martensitic ) transformation is analyzed in section [ pfe ] .",
    "the volume change due to such a phase transition is considered in section [ vlc ] .",
    "non - linear thermal expansion and its possible contribution to the martensitic phase transition is studied in section [ bccfcc ] .",
    "let us recall briefly main ideas of the landau theory of continuous phase transitions@xcite . as landau supposed , if the symmetry group of low - symmetry phase @xmath3 is a subgroup of the symmetry group @xmath4 of the high - symmetry one , than there is some variable @xmath5 , called as an `` order parameter '' which is invariant under all the transformations from the @xmath3 whereas some transformations from @xmath4 change it .",
    "the thermodynamic potential  the gibbs free energy could be expanded as a power series in @xmath5 near the critical temperature . as the thermodynamic potential should not change under the symmetry transformations which do not change the structure ,",
    "the @xmath5 in the high - temperature phase should vanish .",
    "general expression for the ( ginzburg - landau ) expansion of the difference in gibbs free energy between the phases has the following form@xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a critical temperature and the coefficients @xmath8 and @xmath9 should be positive .",
    "the equilibrium value of @xmath5 is determined by the minimization of @xmath10 with respect to @xmath5 : @xmath11 the solutions are the high - symmetry phase with @xmath12 , stable for @xmath13 and low - temperature phase with @xmath14 that is stable for @xmath15 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath5 on @xmath16 is continuous in the critical point @xmath7 , hence this model describes the second - order phase transition .",
    "the gibbs free energy as well as entropy changes continuously trough the transition temperature @xmath7 @xmath17 @xmath18 but the derivative manifests discontinuity @xmath19    vanishing of the coefficient of second degree in the ginzburg - landau expansion ( [ glsecond ] ) when the temperature approaches @xmath7 leads to the critical fluctuations of the order parameter .",
    "mean square of the homogeneous order parameter fluctuations is given by well - known expression@xcite @xmath20 inhomogeneous fluctuations appear to be crucial in many cases , however , for the purposes of present study they can be neglected due to long - range nature of elastic interactions in solids@xcite .",
    "let us consider the effect of the external field @xmath21 conjugated to the physical variable of the order parameter .",
    "in what follows it is an external pressure conjugated to the symmetrized spontaneous strain .",
    "the ginzburg - landau expansions takes the form @xmath22 and the minimization of @xmath10 with respect to @xmath5 leads to the cubic equation @xmath23 with discriminant @xmath24 it is seen that for any value of external field @xmath21 the high - symmetry phase with @xmath12 no longer provides the stable solution of the eq.([minimum ] ) .",
    "instead , we get @xmath25 for any temperature .",
    "it is known@xcite , that the cubic equation has one solution in real numbers for @xmath26 and three ones for the case of @xmath27 .",
    "it means that for temperatures below some critical one that now depends on @xmath21 @xmath28 the additional minimum of the gibbs free energy appears that corresponds to new phase .",
    "however , the initial phase described by the high - temperature solution of ( [ field ] ) provides the minimum with lower value of the free energy and is , thus , stable .",
    "the free energy behavior as well as the order parameter dependencies on the temperature for different values of the external field are shown in the fig.[iienergy ] and fig.[iiordpar ] .",
    "it is seen from the fig.[iienergy ] and might be proven rigorously that different minima of the @xmath29 curve have different energies for any temperature @xmath30 .",
    "thus , the high - temperature state remains stable throughout all the region of the phase co - existence .",
    "only the condition of @xmath31 leads to the degeneracy with respect to sign of @xmath5 that implies the equal energies of different minima .",
    "it leads to a phase transition of the first order under the variation of external field at constant temperature @xmath15 .",
    "in other words , the variation of temperature and external field act on the systems described by the expression ( [ glf ] ) in a different way , because the field variation may lead to the phase change but the temperature one may not .",
    "the external field suppress the transition , however some decrease in @xmath32 leads to enhanced fluctuations of the order parameter around @xmath7 with smooth peak instead of divergence ( [ fluct ] ) shown in the fig.([fieldfluct ] ) .",
    "so , some transition anomalies are preserved in sufficiently small external fields @xmath21 .",
    "the first - order phase transition arises in the landau theory when the symmetry of the system allows to have non - vanishing third - degree invariant composed by the order - parameter component@xcite .",
    "corresponding term should be taken into account in the ginzburg - landau expansion : @xmath33 choosing the case of @xmath34 , that gives positive @xmath5 in the low - temperature phase , we can write the free energy expansion in the following form @xmath35 with @xmath36      for the @xmath37 case minimization of the gibbs free energy ( [ firstfield ] ) with respect to @xmath38 implies the equation @xmath39    for @xmath40 there is the only minimum at @xmath41 corresponding to a high - temperature undistorted phase . the second minimum at @xmath42 , or @xmath43 appears at @xmath44 and corresponds to a low - temperature distorted phase which initially has higher free energy .",
    "the phase energies become equal at @xmath45 , though the supercooling of the high - temperature state as well as superheating of the low - temperature one are possible .",
    "it means that the first - order phase transition takes place at the temperature @xmath46 .",
    "as well as in the second - order case , high - symmetry phase becomes unstable at @xmath47 .    at the temperature of the first - order transition",
    "@xmath46 the order parameter jumps from the @xmath12 to the @xmath48 overcoming the activation energy barrier @xmath49 the entropy now has a finite change at transition temperature @xmath50 that correspond to latent heat of the phase transition @xmath51    in order the weakly - first - order transition to be properly identified and clearly separated from the background of critical fluctuations around @xmath7 ( [ fluct ] ) , the transition jump of the order parameter should be greater than its mean fluctuation .",
    "in other word , the energy scale of the problem should be larger than the thermal fluctuation energy @xmath52 .",
    "it implies the condition for the value of the third - order coefficient in the ginzburg - landau expansion @xmath53 if this condition is not satisfied , the phase transition is `` too weak '' to be first - order and will be seen in the experiments as a continuous one .      substituting @xmath54 into the ginzburg - landau expansion ( [ firstfield ] )",
    ", we get the third - order term excluded@xcite : @xmath55 where @xmath56    this is equivalent to the free energy expansion ( [ glf ] ) for the second - order phase transition under the external field , the only difference consisting of the term @xmath57 that is independent on @xmath58 .",
    "it appears because the free energy is counted with respect to the @xmath59 or @xmath60 state , that implies @xmath61 .",
    "the condition ( [ minimum ] ) leads to cubic equation ( [ field ] ) with the effective temperature @xmath62 and field @xmath63 instead of the real ones .",
    "the sign of discriminant @xmath64 of this equation indicates , whether it has one root or three ones in real numbers .",
    "the latter case corresponds to the appearance of different minima on @xmath65 , second minima of the free energy appearing when @xmath66 .",
    "hence , ( [ transgl ] ) can be considered as the ginzburg - landau expansion for the phase transition between the states , related with different minima of the gibbs free energy .",
    "the minima have non - zero values of order parameter , because the symmetry is broken already by the applied field for any temperature .",
    "as there is no symmetry breaking , it is not a true phase transition , described by the landau theory , however , the undistorted phase with @xmath41 can be treated as an analog of ideal high - symmetry `` praphase''@xcite that would allow the symmetry reduction to both of the phases which provide minima of the free energy .",
    "it is interesting to note that the first - order phase transition in absence of external field appears to be equivalent to the second - order one under the action of effective external field , the only feature of this situation is zero value of @xmath5 for one of two minima of @xmath65 .",
    "the phase diagram in @xmath67 plane is shown at the fig.[diagram ] .",
    "additional minimum of the free energy appears for @xmath68 with @xmath69 that leads to the hysteresis with respect to the external field @xmath70 .",
    "according to an analogy with the second - order phase transition described by ( [ glf ] ) , the different minima of the @xmath71 have equal energy only at @xmath72 .",
    "this is the condition of the first - order phase transition between corresponding phases and it determines the effect of applied field on the transition temperature @xmath73 @xmath74 for @xmath37 we get naturally @xmath75 .",
    "the eq.([tastsigma ] ) corresponds to the straight line on @xmath67 plane ( fig.[diagram ] ) .",
    "for @xmath76 on this line the equilibrium phase has @xmath77 .",
    "this state is an analog of the undistorted high - symmetry phase of the landau theory without an external field which is unstable for @xmath78 and becomes a maximum of @xmath79 , i.e. the energy barrier with a height of @xmath80 for the first - order transition between two different minima with @xmath81 , separated by the order parameter discontinuity @xmath82    as this line of the first - order transition in the phase diagram at @xmath67 plane separates states without symmetry - breaking relationship@xcite , it terminates in critical point @xmath83 .",
    "the discontinuity in order parameter as well as the potential barrier separating different minima of the free energy vanishes when approaching this critical point .",
    "there is no transition for @xmath84 or @xmath85 , that means suppressing the weakly - first - order phase transition under the fields greater than the critical one . in a contrast with the second - order case where arbitrary small external field destroys the phase transition , here",
    "we find that the fields lower than @xmath86 preserve the transition .",
    "the critical point is an analog of the continuous phase transition from state with @xmath87 corresponding to the breaking of symmetry with respect to change of the @xmath58 sign .",
    "a phase transition characterized by the appearance of spontaneous strain at the transition temperature is called ferroelastic@xcite .",
    "when this spontaneous strain describes the symmetry breaking at the transition , and is , thus , an order parameter , the proper ferroelastic transition takes place . for the case of improper ferroelastics",
    "the spontaneous strain is a complimentary order parameter , coupled with the primary one .",
    "the free energy difference between the parent and product phases for the case of proper ferroelastic transition is due to the elastic strain and corresponds to the ginzburg - landau expansion of the elastic energy in series of the strain components@xcite .",
    "the second - order term in the ginzburg - landau expansion is a linear combination of the second - order elastic constants that vanishes at the critical temperature .",
    "it is the eigenvalue of the lattice stiffness matrix corresponding to the relevant irreducible representation of the symmetry group of the high - temperature phase@xcite .",
    "the strain tensor components transforming with respect to this representation form the order parameter and the phase transition belongs to so - called `` soft - mode '' class , because it is accompanied by a noticeable softening of the corresponding acoustic mode of atomic vibrations@xcite , visible as a central peak of the inelastic neutron scattering .      in what follows the case of cubic symmetry of a high - temperature phase will be considered , that describes the martensitic transformations in the a15 compound@xcite as well as in some metallic alloys .",
    "the spontaneous strain tensor has only diagonal components and the order parameter is composed by their symmetrized linear combinations@xcite @xmath88 the @xmath89 corresponds to the extension along @xmath90 axis without the volume change and @xmath91 describes the strain non - tetragonality in @xmath92 plane .",
    "the critical acoustic mode is a transverse phonons distributing in @xmath93 directions .",
    "the elastic free energy expansion can be written in the ginzburg - landau form@xcite @xmath94 with the following combination of the elastic constants as the coefficients@xcite @xmath95    substituting @xmath96 we get the ginzburg - landau expansion in the form @xmath97 the minimization with respect to @xmath98 @xmath99 implies @xmath100 depending on the sign of @xmath101 . in the case of @xmath34",
    "we get three solutions @xmath102 corresponding to the low - symmetry tetragonal phases obtained by the extension of parent cubic lattice along three coordinate axis . the free energy dependence on @xmath5 for these",
    "minima is the single - component ginzburg - landau expansion ( [ tot ] ) for the weakly - discontinuous phase transition .",
    "as the solutions are related through the symmetry transformation from the cubic point symmetry group and , thus , are completely equivalent , we can consider further only one of them , e.g. @xmath103 , without loss of generality .",
    "hence , we can use the landau theory for the case of single - component order parameter .",
    "the cubic symmetry allows the third - order term in the ginzburg - landau expansion to appear , hence , the landau theory says that the phase transition should be of the first order .",
    "indeed , for the case of ni - al and some other systems partial mode softening takes place and the finite strain appears at the transition , though the shear modulus decreases considerably near the phase transition temperature .",
    "some other so - called `` pre - transformation '' phenomena were found in a number of alloys@xcite .",
    "this case respects to the weakly first - order transition mentioned in section [ wfot ]",
    ".    however , this third - degree term appears to be very small in in - tl , v@xmath0si and some other alloys@xcite where the critical mode becomes almost complete soften , i.e. shear modulus @xmath104 vanishes as temperature goes to @xmath7 .",
    "central peak of the inelastic neutron scattering as well as other critical phenomena appear and the order parameter undergoes very small change at the critical temperature @xmath7@xcite .",
    "so , the transition is very weakly discontinuous , being sometimes of the second order within the experimental accuracy .",
    "the considerable enhancement in the acoustic wave magnitude occurs in the vicinity of the critical temperature @xmath7 .",
    "hence , this case corresponds to the the second - order phase transformation considered in section [ second - order ] .",
    "an applied pressure gives rise the external stress tensor @xmath105 corresponding to linear term @xmath106 in the free energy expression@xcite .",
    "the symmetry - breaking strain components are sensitive only to diagonal components of @xmath105 , hence , relevant external stress is superposition of hydrostatic pressure @xmath107 with ones applied ( uniaxially ) along @xmath90 axis @xmath108 and within @xmath92 plane @xmath109 hence , @xmath110 and @xmath111 are external fields , conjugated to the primary order parameter components @xmath89 and @xmath91 , respectively , whereas hydrostatic pressure will be shown below affect the ferroelastic phase transition through the volume change @xmath112 related with the order parameter by the coupling term proportional to @xmath113 .",
    "applied non - hydrostatic pressure @xmath114 breaks the symmetry of undistorted phase , moving out corresponding minimum of @xmath115 from the origin and lifts the degeneracy between three low - symmetry phases ( [ sol3 ] ) .",
    "the pressure which is co - aligned with the spontaneous strain corresponding to one of these solutions , e.g. @xmath116 , preserves the tetragonal symmetry of distorted phase and the pressure value @xmath110 is an external field conjugated to the value of symmetrized strain @xmath89 as a single - component order parameter , considered in section [ fieldfirst ] .",
    "otherwise the stable low - temperature state of the system has rhombohedral lattice with three different lattice parameters that is characterized by the pressure - dependent @xmath89 and @xmath91 . in what follows the effect of uniaxial pressure @xmath110 conjugated to @xmath89 , which preserves the tetragonal symmetry of low - temperature phase",
    "is analyzed .",
    "in the agreement with the analysis of section [ extfield ] the uniaxial pressure was found@xcite to suppress the ferroelastic phase transition from cubic to tetragonal lattice in the v@xmath0si compound , where third - order term is very small and the transition is of the second - order . for ni - al alloy , where the first - order phase transition takes place , the uniaxial pressure appears@xcite to shift the transition temperature linearly in complete agreement with the eq.([tastsigma ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that though this alloy exhibit martensitic transition where spontaneous homogeneous strain is accompanied by so - called shuffle@xcite related with @xmath117 critical mode , the central peak of the inelastic neutron scattering as well as noticeable softening of @xmath118 elastic constant appear well above the transition temperature .",
    "hence , this case can also be analysed in the frame of the landau theory of ferroelastic phase transition .",
    "if the phase transition is sensitive to applied external hydrostatic pressure then there is a difference in the volume of elementary cell of the parent and product phases .",
    "the volume change , indeed , takes place in some cases and it was shown@xcite that virtual volumetric strain could reduce the potential barrier for the system to overcome in the phase transition development . in order to analyze the volume change one needs to include corresponding terms into the ginzburg - landau expansion of the gibbs free energy .",
    "then the equilibrium state of the system should provide the minimum of the free energy with respect to both shear strain and volumetric one .      in the linear elasticity",
    "theory@xcite the trace of strain tensor is a measure of the volume change , the corresponding symmetrized linear combination of the strain components having a form @xmath119 due to thermal strain as well as external pressure , the expansion of the elastic energy in series of @xmath112 should start with the linear terms@xcite : @xmath120 where @xmath121 is some reference temperature for volume change , @xmath122 and @xmath123 are the volume thermal expansion coefficient and bulk modulus , respectively and @xmath124 is external pressure applied .",

    "the minimization of @xmath126 with respect to @xmath112 implies equilibrium values of @xmath127 and @xmath128 @xmath129 @xmath130    it is easy to see that usual thermodynamical expressions for isothermal compressibility @xmath131 and thermal expansion coefficient @xmath132 @xmath133 are satisfied for such an expression of the gibbs free energy if one bears in mind that @xmath124 is opposite of the pressure _ inside _ the system , which is a thermodynamical variable ( we also put the volume of whole system equal to 1 for convenience ) .      the lowest - order term of coupling between the shear strains @xmath134 and volume change @xmath112 for the case of a cubic symmetry of the high - temperature phase is@xcite @xmath135 where @xmath136 . substituting this term into the expansion of elastic energy in a power series of the volume change , we get the expression ( [ etat ] ) for the equilibrium value of @xmath112 in the following form @xmath137    the coupling term does not induce any anisotropy in the @xmath138 plane , hence , three equivalent minima of the gibbs free energy at low temperature have a form ( [ sol3 ] ) .",
    "we consider one particular solution of the form @xmath116 . the uniaxial pressure @xmath110 applied along @xmath139 axis does not break the tetragonal symmetry of corresponding low - temperature phase .",

    "the volume change @xmath112 as well as its derivatives  thermal expansion coefficient @xmath8 and isothermal compressibility @xmath131 does not depend directly on @xmath110 , but only follows the dependence of symmetrized shear strain @xmath89 through eqs.([etant ] ) .",

    "the second - order phase transition disappears under the applied external field @xmath110 , hence , @xmath190 , @xmath131 and @xmath191 manifest continuous behavior near the temperature @xmath7 under arbitrary small external field .",
    "however , from eq.([etadeta ] ) we get in such a case @xmath192 for sufficiently small values @xmath110 of external uniaxial pressure the difference in the isothermal compressibility , thermal expansion coefficient and specific heat outside close vicinity of the transition temperature appears to be described by eqs.([cmprsblt2 ] ) - ( [ specheat2 ] ) .",
    "the critical divergencies given by eqs.([fluctvol ] ) and ( [ fluctexpans ] ) disappear and the smeared peaks around @xmath175 appear instead .",
    "if the third - order coefficient in the ginzburg - landau expansion ( [ unrtot ] ) has a non - zero value , then the eq.([rtot ] ) in the absence of external uniaxial pressure describes the first - order phase transition at the temperature @xmath193 the shift of the transition temperature by the applied hydrostatic pressure has the same form ( [ temp ] ) as for the second - order transition .",
    "the volume difference between the phases appears to depend on the temperature through the temperature dependence of @xmath89 given by eq.([foe ] ) @xmath194 this leads to finite volume change at the phase transition temperature @xmath195 that can be observed in diffraction as well as dilatometric studies .",
    "eq.([etadeta ] ) takes the form @xmath196 and along with eq.([expcoefgen ] ) gives the temperature dependence of difference in thermal expansion coefficients between the low- and high - symmetry phases in the form @xmath197 the change of thermal expansion coefficient at the transition point @xmath198 now has a form @xmath199 the value of @xmath200 decreases to that given by eq.([sotal ] ) as @xmath16 goes down from @xmath201 to @xmath175 .    for the difference in isothermal compressibility between low - temperature phase and high - temperature one we can find similarly @xmath202 that gives us the phase transition discontinuity in the form @xmath203 it should always be positive according to general thermodynamical arguments@xcite .",
    "the specific heat has the following temperature dependence @xmath204 with the jump at the transition temperature @xmath205 the phase transition discontinuities of volume and entropy are related through the clapeyron - clausius relationship with the slope ( [ dtdp ] of the equilibrium line at phase diagram @xmath206    both the thermal expansion coefficient and isothermal compressibility of undistorted phase with @xmath12 do not depend on temperature , so , the expressions ( [ expcoeff1 ] ) and ( [ comprsblty1 ] ) describe the temperature dependence of these quantities in the low - symmetry phase that can be observed experimentally below the transition temperature @xmath198 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the effects can be seen for @xmath201 being sufficiently far from @xmath7 , outside the temperature region where thermal fluctuations [ fluct ] are important , because the fluctuation - induced singularities of the thermal expansion coefficient as well as the other quantities become larger in critical region than the jumps in their equilibrium values .",
    "thus , the third - order coefficient @xmath155 should satisfy condition ( [ bcond ] ) .",
    "such a situation occurs in the case of ni - al and some other alloys where shear modulus at @xmath201 is soften only slightly  by 10 @xmath207 20% , and the experimentally measured temperature dependence of shear modulus can be interpreted as pointing even to negative @xmath7@xcite .",
    "however , for in - tl system where third - order term appears to be very small and the shear modulus almost vanishes at the transition temperature , the volume discontinuity is so small@xcite that it is hidden by thermal fluctuations ( [ fluctvol ] ) .",
    "the similar effect occurs with respect to other discontinuities at the transition temperature @xmath201 , which is very close to @xmath7 .      for the case of the first - order phase transition the dependence of the discontinuity in the order parameter on the uniaxial pressure @xmath110 follows from general expression ( [ jumpfield ] ) @xmath208 that leads to the following volume change at @xmath209 @xmath210    both parent and product phases have @xmath211 and @xmath212 under applied external uniaxial pressure , thus , the differences in the isothermal compressibility , thermal expansion coefficient and specific heat are proportional to @xmath213 where @xmath214 and @xmath215 correspond to two different minima of the free energy given by the different solutions of eq.([inexpl ] ) .",
    "using the dimensionless variables ( [ firstfieldvarbls ] ) we can write eq.([etadeta ] ) in the form @xmath216 at the transition point we have @xmath72 and @xmath217 that gives the expression @xmath218 taking into account that @xmath219 has the same value @xmath220 at the transition point for both phases , we can finally obtain @xmath221    from the eqs.([specheatgen ] ) - ( [ expcoefgen ] ) we get the expressions for the phase transition discontinuities of the specific heat , isothermal compressibility and thermal expansion coefficient as follows @xmath222 @xmath223 @xmath224    in the limit of small values of external uniaxial pressure we get the eqs.([specheat1j ] ) , ( [ comprsblty1j ] ) and ( [ expcoeff1j ] ) , derived from their temperature dependence in the section [ firsabsfield ] .",
    "when @xmath110 goes to the value of the critical point @xmath225 , these discontinuities diverge as @xmath226 .",
    "there is the case of martensitic transformation of especial interest , namely fcc  bcc transformation in fe and some ferrous alloys . since , there is no group - subgroup relationship for the symmetry breaking , the landau theory is , generally speaking , inapplicable to this case .",
    "however , there is an orientational relationship between lattices of the parent and product phase , and the transition could be described in terms of spontaneous strain of so - called bain type@xcite .",
    "the bain strain is the single - axis shear of the same kind as an order parameter of the ferroelastic phase transition from cubic to tetragonal lattice .",
    "it is accompanied by the volume change , that is approximately 1.5% in the case of pure fe , where transformation from austenite fcc @xmath227-phase to ferrite bcc @xmath8-one takes place at 910@xmath228c .",
    "if the lattice periods for austenite and martensite ( ferrite ) are @xmath229 and @xmath230 respectively , then the strain tensor components have the form @xmath231    the fundamental feature of this case as compared with the above considered phase transition from cubic lattice to the tetragonal one , is the fixed value of the spontaneous strain needed to get the symmetry properties of the low - temperature phase . in the above",
    "considered case for any non - zero value of the order parameter @xmath89 the symmetry of the lattice was tetragonal , whereas in the case of the fcc  bcc transformation the peculiar value of @xmath89 is needed to get the low - temperature bcc lattice .",
    "if we separate the shear strain from the volume change by taking the latter equal to zero , then we get single ( and very large ) value of symmetrized shear strain ( [ eta1 ] ) @xmath232 hence , this phase transition is completely different from the continuous ones , which the landau theory describes , where the value of the order parameter changes with temperature in low - symmetry phase according to the minimization of its gibbs free energy ( [ minimum ] ) .",
    "however , coupling with the volume change @xmath112 makes it possible to have the @xmath89 variation in low - temperature phase without breaking of its symmetry .",
    "indeed , the strain tensor ( [ baintens ] ) implies the following expressions for the symmetrized combinations used above as the order parameter components @xmath233 and we get the relationship between shear strain and volume change in the form @xmath234 hence , the variation in value of @xmath89 preserves the bcc structure of the low - temperature phase , if @xmath112 is changed in such a way that this relationship is satisfied .",
    "it should be noted that ( [ fe ] ) is meaningful only in restricted region of @xmath112 and @xmath89 .",
    "for example , @xmath148 implies unreal result @xmath235 from ( [ eta12kappa ] ) .",
    "thus , ( [ fe ] ) is justified only in some vicinity of the transition that is characterized by small volume change @xmath236 .",
    "having supposed fcc  bcc transformation to be ferroelastic one , we should get the minimum of elastic energy for the values of @xmath112 and @xmath89 obeying the condition ( [ fe ] ) .",
    "let us study what are the coefficient in the expansion which provide such a minimum . without careful analysis , it should be noted , however , that the linear approximation used above gives another kind of relationship ( [ etant ] ) between the shear strain and volume change , thus , non - linear approximation for the thermal expansion energy should be used .",
    "non - linearity arises naturally when taking into account large value of the strain tensor component .",
    "the @xmath237 for bain strain in pure iron is approximately three times larger than real value of the volume change for this transformation given by direct multiplication of the lattice periods of low - temperature phase @xmath238 it could be expressed through the symmetrized combinations @xmath112 , @xmath89 and @xmath91 as follows @xmath239    for the fcc  bcc transition we have @xmath143 and proper account for the volume change should , thus , involve the terms of higher order in @xmath112 and @xmath89 .",
    "terms of the first and second order in the volume change @xmath112 within non - linear approximation have no longer simple relation with the thermal expansion and isothermal compressibility that was obtained in section [ volin ] .",
    "similarly , other terms in both @xmath141 and @xmath240 should be changed .",
    "general non - linear elastic energy expansion near the elastic instability with respect to @xmath89 now has the form @xmath241 where the coefficients @xmath242 and @xmath243 in highest - order terms should be positive and we again consider the particular expression with @xmath143 .",
    "the minimization with respect to @xmath112 implies @xmath244 that leads to the following relationship between @xmath112 and @xmath89 in distorted phase with @xmath245 : @xmath246 for the high - symmetry phase we have @xmath247 as there is no co - existing high - symmetry equilibrium states with different values of @xmath112 , the condition @xmath248 should be satisfied . substituting this expression into eq.([eta0eta1 ] ) , we get @xmath249 in order the right - hand side of this expression to be positive condition @xmath250 must be satisfied , because of positiveness of @xmath242 .    finally , we can get the following expression for the minimum of the free energy ( [ nonlingle ] ) @xmath251 and eq.([fe ] ) along with ( [ cond ] ) lead to the following relations between the coefficients in the elastic energy expansion ( [ nonlingle ] ) @xmath252 @xmath253 @xmath254 these relations could be , generally speaking , satisfied only in isolated points on phase diagram and the phenomenological approach used in the present study is unable to find their origin .",
    "it could be done only in some microscopic theory beyond the scope of the paper . however , as far as these relations are satisfied , we can try to find their consequences for the elastic properties of the system under phase transition .",
    "substituting these expressions into the free energy ( [ nonlingle ] ) and excluding the volume change through eq.([fe ] ) we get renormed expansion of the elastic energy with respect to symmetrized strain @xmath89 @xmath255 which can be considered as a ginzburg - landau expansion for ferroelastic phase transition .",
    "the first term does not depend on @xmath89 , the critical temperature @xmath7 is defined by the condition @xmath256 and the temperature @xmath209 of the first - order transition with finite jump in @xmath89 and @xmath112 is given by an equation @xmath257 where @xmath258 and @xmath101 are the expressions in brackets of the first- and second - degree terms in eq.([martfe ] ) . in order some transition line to exist on phase diagram",
    ", the @xmath242 coefficient should be temperature- and pressure - dependent .",
    "we have analyzed the volume change effect on ferroelastic ( martensitic ) phase transitions and considered the case of cubic lattice of high - symmetry phase as an example .",
    "the minimization of elastic energy with respect to hydrostatic strain as a secondary order parameter is shown to renorm the second- and fourth - order coefficients of the ginzburg - landau expansion of elastic free energy in powers of symmetrized shear strain .",
    "the coupling between shear strain and volume change appears to shift the transition temperature under applied external hydrostatic pressure and lead to the finite volume effect of the weakly discontinuous ferroelastic phase transition .",
    "the isothermal compressibility as well as thermal expansion coefficient is shown to diverge near the critical temperature of the second - order ferroelastic phase transition due to the homogeneous fluctuations of the order parameter .",
    "the difference between their values in parent and product phases outside the fluctuation region appears to be proportional to coupling coefficient .",
    "for the case of first - order transition isothermal compressibility and thermal expansion coefficient depend on the temperature in the low - symmetry phase according to the square root law .",
    "the uniaxial pressure conjugated to the symmetrized shear strain is shown to suppress the second - order transition , leading to the change of divergencies for smeared peaks in the temperature dependencies of isothermal compressibility and thermal expansion coefficient around critical temperature .",
    "we have found the first - order transition surface at the phase diagram in coordinates of the temperature and hydrostatic as well as uniaxial pressure .",
    "this terminates at the line of critical point and the uniaxial pressure of magnitude lower than critical , shifts the transition temperature , but preserves the transition . the critical hydrostatic pressure that suppresses phase transition has linear temperature dependence .",
    "the order parameter discontinuity and the volume effect diverge at the critical line as well as the difference in isothermal compressibility and thermal expansion coefficient between the parent and product phases .",
    "the coupling between the volume change and shear strain is shown to lead to the fcc  bcc martensitic transformation for some special relations between the coefficients in the free energy expansion . though some fixed value of the bain strain is needed to get the low - temperature bcc lattice , the volume change as a secondary order parameter makes it possible to have some temperature variation of the shear strain preserving the bcc lattice and changing its period only . the non - linear expression for the elastic energy of thermal expansion",
