    "the mathematics of transport in nonlinear dynamical systems has received considerable attention for more than two decades , driven in part by applications in fluid dynamics , atmospheric and ocean dynamics , molecular dynamics , granular flow and other areas .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for reviews of transport and transport - related phenomena .",
    "early attempts to characterise transport barriers in fluid dynamics include time - dependent invariant manifolds ( such as lobe - dynamics @xcite ) and finite - time lyapunov exponents @xcite .",
    "more recently , in two - dimensional area - preserving flows , @xcite proposed finding closed curves whose time - averaged length is stationary under small perturbations ; this aim is closest in spirit to the predecessor work of this paper @xcite , though the latter theory applies in arbitrary finite dimensions and the curves need not be closed . in parallel to these efforts , the notion of almost - invariant sets @xcite in autonomous systems spurred the development of probabilistic methods to transport based around the transfer operator . in relation to transport barriers , numerical observations @xcite indicated connections between the boundaries of almost - invariant sets and invariant manifolds of low - period points .",
    "transfer operator techniques were later extended to dynamical systems with general time dependence , with the introduction of coherent sets as the time - dependent analogues of almost - invariant sets .",
    "topological approaches to phase space mixing have also been developed @xcite , including connections with almost - invariant sets @xcite .    in @xcite , froyland introduced the notion of a dynamic isoperimetric problem , namely searching for subsets of a manifold whose boundary size to enclosed volume is minimised in a time - averaged sense under general time - dependent nonlinear dynamics .",
    "solutions to this problem were constructed from eigenvectors of a dynamic laplace operator , a time - average of pullbacks of laplace operators under the dynamics .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the dynamic laplace operator arises as a zero - diffusion limit of the transfer operator constructions for finite - time coherent sets in @xcite .",
    "this result demonstrated that finite - time coherent sets ( those sets that maximally resist mixing over a finite time interval ) , also had the persistently small boundary length to enclosed volume ratio property ; intuitively this is reasonable because diffusive mixing between sets can only occur through their boundaries .",
    "thus , finite - time coherent sets have dual minimising properties : slow mixing ( probabilistic ) and low boundary growth ( geometric ) .",
    "the theory in @xcite was restricted to the situation where the advective dynamics was volume - preserving , and to tracking the transport of a uniformly distributed tracer in euclidean space .",
    "in the present work , we extend the results of @xcite in three ways : ( i ) to non - volume preserving dynamics , ( ii ) to tracking the transport of nonuniformly distributed tracers , and ( iii ) to dynamics operating on curved manifolds .",
    "we now begin to be more specific about the results of the present paper .",
    "let @xmath0 denote a connected @xmath1-dimensional compact @xmath2 riemannian manifold and @xmath3 denote a @xmath2 hypersurface disconnecting @xmath0 into submanifolds @xmath4 ; that is @xmath5 is a partition of @xmath0 .",
    "for example , @xmath0 could be the unit square @xmath6 ^ 2\\subset \\mathbb{r}^2 $ ] and @xmath3 either a curve from a boundary point to another boundary point or a closed curve .",
    "on @xmath0 we place a riemannian metric @xmath7 and a probability measure @xmath8 .",
    "the size of a set @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 and by a process of inducing explained in the next section , we develop a measure @xmath11 to determine the size of ( @xmath12)-dimensional objects such as @xmath3 .",
    "to continue our trivial example , if @xmath13 is 2-dimensional lebesgue measure , then @xmath14 is 1-dimensional lebesgue measure , which can be used to measure curve length in @xmath15 . in order to track",
    "the transport of nonuniformly distributed passive tracers ( e.g.  chemical concentrations in fluids , air mass in the atmosphere , salt in the ocean ) , we require a general probability measure @xmath8 that represents the initial distribution to be tracked .",
    "similarly , in order to estimate the amount of material that can be ejected through the boundary at any given time , we require the measure @xmath11 to compute boundary size .    let us suppose that the dynamics over a finite time duration is given by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 can be a single transformation , the concatenation of several maps over several discrete time steps , or the flow map for a time - dependent vector field over some duration @xmath18 .",
    "the following brief discussion checks the boundary at the initial and final times , but in the case of continuous time , one may continuously check the boundary size as described in section [ sec : mts ] .",
    "the manifold @xmath19 is equipped with a riemannian metric @xmath20 ( which need not be the pushforward of @xmath7 ) , and a probability measure @xmath21 ( which must be the pushforward of @xmath8 ) .",
    "conservation of mass enforces the definition @xmath21 , but in many applications we may not want @xmath7 and @xmath20 to be related by @xmath17",
    ". continuing our example , if @xmath22 ^ 2 $ ] and @xmath17 is not area - preserving , then @xmath23 ( 2-dimensional lebesgue measure ) will be transformed by @xmath17 to a probability measure @xmath24 with a non - constant density .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath22 ^ 2\\subset \\mathbb{r}^2 $ ] , we have in this example that @xmath25 is the standard euclidean metric .    given a disconnecting hypersurface @xmath3 ,",
    "we compute the dynamic cheeger constant @xmath26 and wish to minimise @xmath27 over all smooth @xmath3 disconnecting @xmath0 .",
    "the numerator of quantifies the boundary size of @xmath3 _ and _ its image @xmath28 ; thus , minimising over all smooth @xmath3 finds the interface @xmath3 which has minimal combined length , both before and after evolution ( and in the later continuous versions , throughout evolution ) .",
    "the denominator of ( [ cheeger0 ] ) is a standard normalisation condition in ( static ) isoperimetric problems to avoid trivial solutions and ensure that both @xmath29 and @xmath30 are of macroscopic size .    beyond the generalised dynamic isoperimetric problem described above , our main contributions are firstly the formulation of a dynamic sobolev constant ( a functional version of the dynamic cheeger constant ) in our general setting and a corresponding proof of a dynamic version of the celebrated federer - fleming theorem ( see e.g p.131 @xcite for the classical static statement and @xcite for the dynamic statement in the volume - preserving , uniform density , flat manifold setting ) , which equates the geometric cheeger constant with the functional sobolev constant .",
    "secondly , we define a generalised version of the dynamic laplace operator constructed in @xcite . in our general setting , the operator is @xmath31 where @xmath32 are weighted laplace - beltrami operators , weighted by @xmath33 respectively .",
    "the operator @xmath34 defined by @xmath35 is the normalised transfer operator ( previously defined in @xcite in the flat , weighted manifold setting ) , where @xmath36 are the densities of @xmath33 with respect to the volume forms @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the adjoint of @xmath39 .",
    "we will see later that @xmath39 is simply composition with @xmath40 and @xmath38 is composition with @xmath17 .",
    "see section [ sec : lts ] for continuous time versions of @xmath41 .",
    "a related construction is considered in @xcite from the point of view of heat flow , where the focus is on obtaining a single metric , rather than solving an isoperimetric - type problem .",
    "we prove a dynamic version of the well - known cheeger inequality in our generalised setting ( see @xcite for the classic ( static ) cheeger inequality and @xcite for the dynamic cheeger inequality in the volume - preserving , uniform density , flat manifold setting ) , which bounds the cheeger constant above in terms of the dominant nontrivial eigenvalue of @xmath42 ( with natural neumann - like boundary conditions ) .",
    "finally , we prove that @xmath43 where @xmath44 is an @xmath45-mollified version of @xmath39 , used to compute finite - time coherent sets in @xcite and @xmath46 is an explicit constant .",
    "because singular vectors of @xmath44 ( eigenvectors of @xmath47 ) are used in @xcite , and eigenvectors of @xmath41 are used in the present work , this result shows that in the small perturbation limit , the purely probabilistic constructions of @xcite coincide with the purely geometric constructions of the present paper .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section [ sec:2 ]",

    "we now give a brief introduction of the key tools in differential geometry for performing the above task ; additional details are provided in section [ sec : dfg ] of the appendix .",
