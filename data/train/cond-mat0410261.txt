    "quantum phase coherence in normal metals gives rise to numerous corrections to the classically predicted conductivity .",
    "these corrections are commonly referred to as quantum transport phenomena ( qtp ) .",
    "the study of qtp has both fundamental physical importance@xcite and possible implications in novel device architectures@xcite .",
    "the typical experimental application of qtp is to infer quantum coherence time and length scales .",
    "weak localization magnetoresistance ( wl)@xcite , magnetic field - dependent universal conductance fluctuations@xcite ( mfucf ) , time - dependent universal conductance fluctuations@xcite(tducf ) , and aharonov - bohm oscillations@xcite have all been used to examine coherence in normal metals .",
    "qtp in diffusive conductors arise due to interference between possible electronic trajectories from one location to another .",
    "interference , however , is only relevant when the phase of the conduction electrons partial waves is well - defined .",
    "the coherence length is defined as the distance scale over which the phase of a conduction electron s wave function remains correlated to its initial phase .",
    "this length can be related to a coherence _ time _ , @xmath0 , by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the diffusion constant of the electron in the disordered solid .",
    "decoherence or dephasing can occur when an electron experiences an interaction with another dynamical degree of freedom .",
    "the three most common dephasing processes are electron - electron scattering , electron - phonon scattering , and spin - flip interactions with magnetic impurities .",
    "the rates of these processes have distinct temperature dependences , allowing qtp to be used to distinguish between these mechanisms in various metals .",
    "interesting questions have arisen from experimental characterization of electron coherence .",
    "one question is whether precisely the same coherence length is inferred from different qtp .",
    "this is a subtle issue because the precise time scales and processes relevant to a particular observable can be complicated , and the evolution of electronic phase correlations is typically not a simple single - time exponential decay .",
    "a previous test of this coherence length consistency led to equivocal results in quasi-2d silver@xcite .",
    "another question is the cause of an observed low temperature saturation of the coherence length in many materials@xcite .",
    "an explanation with significant experimental support is scattering from dilute concentrations of low kondo temperature magnetic impurities@xcite , while others suggest intrinsic mechanisms@xcite .",
    "these two questions are increasingly related : recent publications@xcite have compared experimental results from different qtp when debating the cause of coherence saturation ; it must be established , however that these analyses are truly comparing equivalent parameters .    in this paper",
    "we briefly review the physics underlying wl , mfucf , and tducf , and report measurements of these effects in two different materials , au@xmath3pd@xmath4 and ag , over a broad temperature and field range .",
    "while we find excellent quantitative agreement between @xmath5 and @xmath6 in all aupd samples , we observe a _ divergence _ between these two inferred coherence lengths in quasi-1d ag samples , as seen previously in quasi-2d ag films@xcite .",
    "we discuss candidate explanations , and suggest that a likely concern is the applicability of the theoretical expressions used to analyze the tducf field dependence .",
    "we also show that the suppression of tducf amplitude at high drive currents is consistent with bias - induced energy averaging .",
    "finally we discuss the implications of these data on dephasing mechanisms at work in these systems .",
    "weak localization arises from the properties of electronic trajectories under time - reversal symmetry .",
    "many electronic paths in a diffusive conductor contain loops . without a magnetic field , an electron circumnavigating such a loop accumulates the same phase as one doing so under time - reversed conditions .",
    "this phase agreement causes constructive interference that enhances back - scattering , leading to a conductivity lower than is classically predicted . with strong spin - orbit interactions ,",
    "the sign of this interference is reversed and leads to enhanced conduction . in the presence of a magnetic field normal to the loop",
    ", the vector potential adds opposite phase shifts to each looped path and corresponding time - reversed conjugate .",
    "this eliminates the constructive ( destructive ) interference when @xmath7 one quantum of flux is threaded through a typical loop .",
    "the result is a magnetoresistance with a field scale related to the area of a typical coherent loop , allowing inference of @xmath8 .",
    "time - dependent ucf are due to the enhanced sensitivity of the conductance to the motion of individual scatters .",
    "unlike weak localization , all interfering paths contribute to this phenomenon . when a scattering site moves , it changes the interference pattern of all intersecting electronic paths within a coherent volume of the scattering site , leading to a conductance change . a single moving scatter can change the conductance within a coherent volume at zero temperature by roughly @xmath9 . if the relaxation times of the scatters are appropriately distributed , the tducf exhibit a @xmath10 power spectrum@xcite , which is the case in many normal metals .",
    "much like weak localization , the noise power of the @xmath10 noise is sensitive to a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "the time - reversed loop contribution ( the cooperon ) will be suppressed as the field is increased while the sensitivity due to all remaining paths , known as the diffuson , remain unchanged@xcite .",
    "this leads to a factor - of - two decrease in the noise power as the field is ramped up , and allows extraction of @xmath11 .",
    "magnetic field - dependent ucf are closely related to the time - dependent form .",
    "the explanation of this phenomenon comes from the ergodic hypothesis@xcite , which implies that other effects that randomize the interference of electronic paths are equivalent to scattering site motion .",
    "since a perpendicular magnetic field introduces an aharonov - bohm phase shift particular to each electronic path , varying such a field leads to conductance fluctuations of the universal size of @xmath12 .",
    "the result is a completely reproducible magnetoresistive pattern that is sample - specific , commonly referred to as the magnetofingerprint .",
    "although the expected size of the conductance fluctuations is universal , the measured effect may be much smaller .",
    "samples much longer and wider than @xmath13 may be treated as uncorrelated fluctuators in series and parallel .",
    "the measured noise power is therefore reduced by a factor @xmath14 , the number of coherent volumes between the ends of the measured sample .",
    "further averaging occurs when the energy range of accessible single - particle states exceeds the correlation energy@xcite , @xmath15 . in this case",
    "the relevant states can be subdivided by energy into coherent sub - bands , each nominally uncorrelated with the others , leading to further ensemble averaging .",
    "one way to increase available energy levels is via thermal energy .",
    "the thermal length , @xmath16 , is the distance two initially in - phase electrons separated in energy by @xmath17 may move before their phases differ by @xmath18 .",
    "the condition @xmath19 is equivalent to @xmath20 , leading to ensemble averaging by @xmath21 to some power .",
    "similarly , when @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the voltage dropped across a coherence length , ensemble averaging will also occur@xcite .    the observed magnitude of the tducf may also be smaller than the universal limit if the conductance fluctuations are not `` saturated '' .",
    "a sample is said to be in the saturated regime if the conductance variance within a coherent volume has reached the limiting @xmath24 amplitude .",
    "how close a sample is to this condition depends on the microscopic nature of the fluctuators .",
    "since mfucf should always exhibit conductance fluctuations on order @xmath9 within a coherent volume , if a sample is in the saturated regime , the tducf noise power integrated over the bandwidth of the fluctuators should equal the mfucf magnitude .",
    "that is , @xmath25 should @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the conductance noise power , @xmath28 is the frequency , and @xmath29 is the conductance . if the fluctuators are typical tunneling two - level systems ( tls ) of the type ubiquitous in disordered solids@xcite , their relaxation rates are estimated to span @xmath7 20 decades@xcite .",
    "tducf measurements in the literature are all thought to be nonsaturated .",
    "this issue is important , as it determines the functional form appropriate for analysis of the field dependence of the tducf .    for wl and tducf , the number of the sample dimensions longer than @xmath13 determines the effective dimensionality of the system with regard to coherence effects .",
    "thus a quasi-2d sample is achieved when @xmath30 and a quasi-1d sample when @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 are sample thickness and width , respectively .",
    "previous comparisons between @xmath5 and @xmath34 have shown a disagreement between these parameters at low temperatures in quasi-2d ag samples@xcite .",
    "this was interpreted as evidence supporting a theoretical treatment@xcite that argued that the nyquist or electron - electron dephasing rate would limit the coherence in wl while the out - scattering rate would limit the coherence in universal conductance fluctuations .",
    "the out - scattering rate is the rate at which an electron will change its momentum state in the boltzmann formalism .",
    "it was shown the two rates have different temperature dependencies at low temperature so a divergence between the coherence lengths inferred from wl and tducf was expected .",
    "recent corrections to the theory@xcite show that , as long as electron - electron scattering is the only small - energy - transfer inelastic process , @xmath8 is expected to equal @xmath11 .",
    "this leaves the experimental results in ag without an explanation .",
    "we discuss this further below .",
    "samples were patterned on undoped gaas substrates using standard electron beam lithography , as discussed in ref .",
    "distances between consecutive leads ( voltage or current ) were 10  @xmath35 m in aupd samples and 20  @xmath35 m in ag samples .",
    "ag ( 0.99999 purity ) samples were made using a single lithography / deposition step with the wire and leads all silver , and no adhesion layer .",
    "au@xmath3pd@xmath4 samples were made using two lithography steps , the first for the aupd wire and the second for the ti / au leads ( 1.5  nm ti , 25  nm au ) .",
    "the aupd source material is expected to be free of ferromagnetic impurities to the 10@xmath36 level . to minimize the contact resistance between the aupd wires and the ti / au leads , samples were exposed to oxygen plasma for 30 seconds prior to the ti / au deposition to remove any resist residue .",
    "typical contact resistances in the aupd samples were less than 30  @xmath37 .",
    "all depositions were performed using an electron beam evaporator at @xmath38  mb . to test the effects of magnetic impurities on the consistency of @xmath8 and @xmath11 ,",
    "one aupd sample was deliberately contaminated with trace impurities by evaporating 2.5 nm of ni@xmath39fe@xmath40 with the sample shutter _ closed _ , prior to the aupd evaporation .",
    ".samples used in magnetotransport and noise measurements .",
    "free electron density of states for au and ag used to calculate @xmath2 for aupd and ag samples : @xmath41  m@xmath42j@xmath43 , from ref .  .",
    "diffusion constants calculated via the einstien relations .",
    "sample d was deliberately contaminated with additional ferromagnetic impurities as described in the text .",
    "the effective dimensionality @xmath44 for coherence effects is determined by the relative size of @xmath13 and the sample dimensions . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab2 ]    for completeness , we compare maximum ( lowest @xmath45 ) coherence times observed for both aupd and ag with a prediction of zero temperature coherence time saturation@xcite .",
    "the predicted zero - temperature dephasing time is @xmath46 here , @xmath47 is the elastic relaxation time of the conduction electrons , @xmath48 is the resistivity , and @xmath49 is a constant of order one . since a strict value for @xmath49 is not known , we select one sample as a reference , and compare the ratio of each maximum @xmath8 to the ratio expected from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gz ] ) and the measured resistivities .",
    "we acquired wl data on ag samples g and h in the dilution refrigerator , with some indications of @xmath50 saturation ; for aupd samples c and d , such saturation has an onset at temperatures above 2  k. since the ag shows the least magnetic contamination , we choose sample h as the reference . in table  [ tab2 ] , we show the predicted ratios from applying eq .",
    "( [ eq : gz ] ) , which fall well outside the errors in the experimentally measured ratios for two of the three samples .",
    "in fact , the one sample that shows good agreement with ( [ eq : gz ] ) is sample d , the sample intentionally contaminated with _ additional _",
    "magnetic impurities known to significantly impact coherence .",
    "these data do not appear to support eq .",
    "( [ eq : gz ] ) . given the demonstrated effectiveness@xcite of trace magnetic impurities to affect @xmath8",
    ", one must view analyses of low temperature coherence saturation with appropriate caution .",
    "we have performed detailed measurements of the wl magnetoresistance , tducf amplitude as a function of field , and the magnetofingerprint of both aupd and ag mesoscopic wires .",
    "a comparison of the coherence lengths inferred from wl and tducf measurements are in strong quantitative agreement for the aupd samples while a disagreement was observed in the ag samples similar to that previously seen in ag films .",
    "we hypothesize that the reason for this discrepancy is that ag may be approaching the saturated noise limit , and further experiments to test this are ongoing .",
    "the observed suppression of tducf magnitude at high drive currents in ag agrees qualitatively with ensemble averaging related to the correlation energy scale , though a quantitative understanding is still lacking .",
    "finally , we have considered the coherence saturation seen in our quasi-2d aupd samples , and discussed the important influence of magnetic impurities in such systems .",
    "the subtle physics , rich phenomenology , and continued presence of surprises ( such as the disagreement between wl and tducf in ag ) demonstrate why electronic coherence in solids remains a lively area for investigation .",
