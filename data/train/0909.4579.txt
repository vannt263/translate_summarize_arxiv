    "if we concentrate on temperatures large compared to the magnetic ordering transitions at @xmath177 k , then a fit is possible and we find that @xmath178 k. because the susceptibility can only be fitted at high temperatures , the frustration parameter can not be fixed precisely .",
    "it is , however , important to note that the best fits for all three compounds yield values of @xmath179 k while @xmath180 k. this confirms our expectation that these materials consisting of the same edge sharing copper - oxygen plaquettes should have very similar magnetic exchange constants as is also the case for the corner sharing chain compounds .",
    "the values we obtain from the susceptibility fits are consistent with values in the literature for licu@xmath4o@xmath4 ( @xmath181 k , @xmath182 k ) @xcite and for li@xmath4zrcuo@xmath3.@xcite for licuvo@xmath3 , however , we find values which differ dramatically from the values given in ref .   which later were also used in a number of other publications .",
    "we want to stress again that these values are not consistent with the latest susceptibility data.@xcite an analysis of neutron scattering data using a standard spin - wave dispersion which seems to confirm these values @xcite is in our opinion not applicable here .",
    "in such an analysis the magnon bandwidth is directly determined by the bare exchange couplings while the stark deviation of the quantum from the classical pitch angle ( see fig .  [ j1j2.fig4](b ) ) suggests that the frustration parameter is strongly renormalized due to quantum fluctuations .",
    "the pitch angle measured experimentally in ref .   of @xmath183",
    "is in fact in excellent agreement with the frustration parameters @xmath184 obtained from the fits in fig .",
    "[ j1j2.fig_mat1 ] . according to fig .",
    "[ j1j2.fig4](b ) we have a quantum pitch angle @xmath185 for @xmath147 and @xmath186 for @xmath99 .",
    "it is important to stress again that only in the classical model large frustration parameters are needed to obtain pitch angles close to @xmath187 .",
    "we expect , according to fig .",
    "[ j1j2.fig4](a ) , that the pitch angle in licuvo@xmath3 can be reduced by @xmath188 by increasing the temperature to @xmath189 k. for li@xmath4zrcuo@xmath3 the magnetic structure has not been studied so far .",
    "the pitch angle for @xmath163 at zero temperature obtained from our numerical calculations is @xmath190 . here",
    "we expect a large variation with temperature ( see fig .",
    "[ j1j2.fig3 ] and fig .",
    "[ j1j2.fig6](b ) ) and it would be interesting to see if this can also be observed experimentally . for licu@xmath4o@xmath4 a pitch angle",
    "@xmath191 has been measured.@xcite such a small pitch angle can not be explained within the @xmath0-@xmath1 model given that @xmath63 according to the fits shown in fig .",
    "[ j1j2.fig_mat3 ] .",
    "we are therefore again lead to the conclusion that the @xmath0-@xmath1 model can not explain the experimental data for this compound .",
    "the rich physics of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model with ferromagnetic nearest neighbor coupling @xmath0 and antiferromagnetic next - nearest neighbor coupling @xmath1 has attracted a lot of interest recently . the phase diagram for this model including",
    "exchange anisotropies and magnetic fields has been addressed in a number of numerical studies.@xcite here we have shown that the physical properties of this simple model are even more intriguing if the interplay of quantum and thermal fluctuations is taken into account .",
    "in particular , we found that the incommensurate oscillations of the spin - spin correlation function ( the quantum analogue of the pitch angle of the classical spiral order ) does not only strongly depend on the frustration parameter @xmath192 but also on temperature .",
    "for zero temperature we find an incommensurability ( pitch angle ) @xmath27 for @xmath193 which is very close to @xmath187 in the quantum model and thus very different from the classical pitch angle @xmath66 in agreement with an earlier study.@xcite at temperatures @xmath194 , however , the pitch angle is much closer to the classical value for @xmath195 .",
    "furthermore , we find a very strong temperature dependence of the pitch angle for frustration parameters close to the critical point @xmath60 .",
    "we therefore expect that the wave vector where the static spin structure factor for li@xmath4zrcuo@xmath3 is peaked - a compound which according to ref .",
    "and the susceptibility analysis performed here has a frustration parameter @xmath196 - varies significantly with temperature . for this range of frustration parameters",
    "we find that a small easy - plane anisotropy ( at zero magnetic field ) leads to long - range chiral order even in the purely one - dimensional model .",
    "we could , however , find no evidence for the dimer phase which was predicted in ref .",
    "for the anisotropic case for larger frustration parameters . another observation which again might be relevant for future studies on li@xmath4zrcuo@xmath3",
    "is that small magnetic fields ( which would correspond to @xmath197 t for li@xmath4zrcuo@xmath3 ) can stabilize an sdw@xmath123 ( @xmath121 multipolar ) phase for @xmath129 .",
    "we suggest that such a phase can already be identified by neutron scattering at finite temperatures by monitoring at the same time the peak position @xmath198 of the static longitudinal structure factor and the magnetization @xmath109",
    ". the signature of the sdw@xmath123 phase would be that @xmath199 for @xmath200 .",
    "we also reanalyzed the susceptibility data for licuvo@xmath3 . here the newer data in ref .",
    "seem to be of much better quality than the older data in ref .  .",
    "the newer data clearly show that the exchange parameters @xmath125 k , @xmath126 k and @xmath201 found in ref .   do not yield a reasonable fit .",
    "these exchange parameters also seem very unlikely given that they deviate significantly from those in other edge - sharing copper - oxygen chains .",
    "our analysis shows that the susceptibility data are best fitted with @xmath202 k and @xmath184 .    in licu@xmath4o@xmath4",
    "two magnetic ordering transitions already occur at temperatures @xmath203 k and an analysis based on the purely one - dimensional @xmath0-@xmath1 model clearly can not be as successful as for licuvo@xmath3 and li@xmath4zrcuo@xmath3 . for @xmath135",
    "we have shown that a reasonable fit of the susceptibility is nevertheless possible leading to @xmath204 k. the frustration parameter remains , however , ambiguous in such a high temperature fit and we find @xmath205 $ ] with the best fit being obtained for @xmath99 .    based on the best fits of the susceptibilities",
    "we conclude that all three considered compounds seem to have very similar exchange constants @xmath180 k and @xmath179 k. the frustration parameter , on the other hand , varies from @xmath206 for li@xmath4zrcuo@xmath3 , @xmath184 for licuvo@xmath3 to @xmath193 for licu@xmath4o@xmath4 .",
    "the parameters found here for licuvo@xmath3 are fully consistent with the measured pitch angle @xmath207 . for licu@xmath4o@xmath4 , on the other hand , the small measured pitch angle @xmath208 can not be explained within the @xmath0-@xmath1 model stressing again that this model is not sufficient to explain the experimental data for this compound .",
