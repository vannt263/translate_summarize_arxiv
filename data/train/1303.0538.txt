    "voids are vast regions occupying most of the volume in the universe with sizes in the range of 20 - 50@xmath1mpc , usually roundish in shape and largely devoid of galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review ) . in the large scale structure of the universe we observe today , the most striking features along with the voids are clusters and filaments . in this picture",
    ", galaxies are distributed in a filament - dominated web - like structure .",
    "filaments connect clusters to each other and , while tenuous , act like bridges @xcite . from recent redshift surveys like the second center for astrophysics",
    "redshift survey @xcite , the 2df galaxy redshift survey @xcite , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite and 2mass redshift survey @xcite we see how filaments , bridges and sheet - like structures form substructures and surround the underdense regions .    notwithstanding the very low density of the void regions , we do find a dilute population of galaxies in their interior .",
    "these _ void galaxies _ appear to have significantly different properties than average field galaxies .",
    "previous studies based on redshift surveys , have shown that the void galaxies are in general small , star forming blue galaxies .",
    "they have a later morphological type and have higher specific star formation rates than the galaxies in average density environment .",
    "largely unaffected by the complexities and processes modifying galaxies in high - density environments , the galaxies living in the isolated void regions are expected to have retained vital clues to their formation and evolution .",
    "it has made the study of the relation between void galaxies and their surroundings an important aspect of the recent interest in environmental influences on galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "void galaxies may be the rare probes of the faint and tenuous substructure that hierarchical structure formation theories predict to exist in voids @xcite .",
    "cosmological simulations show how voids are filled by low - density dark matter filaments , creating a network of tenuous substructures within their interior @xcite .",
    "this may indicate that the galaxies residing in voids are formed along these dark matter filaments , given that the simulations reveal that dark matter haloes are forming along them .",
    "in fact , some earlier observational studies have found indications for such filamentary substructure in voids @xcite .",
    "for example , the latter argue that the dwarf galaxies in their local galaxy sample are located on a dark matter filament that itself is located in a low galaxy density region and is accreting intergalactic cold gas onto the filament .    in this study , we present the most outstanding example of such a filamentary void galaxy configuration , vgs_31 , which was found within the context of the `` void galaxy survey '' ( vgs ) @xcite .",
    "we are conducting a multiwavelength survey of 60 void galaxies , called `` the void galaxy survey '' ( vgs ) @xcite .",
    "galaxies in the vgs have been selected from the sloan digital sky survey data release 7 ( sdss dr7 ) using purely geometric and topological techniques .",
    "the sample was selected on the basis of galaxy density maps produced by the delaunay tessellation field estimator ( dtfe,@xcite ) and the subsequent application of the watershed void finder ( wvf,@xcite ; for a more general application of the watershed transform to the structural analysis of the cosmic web see @xcite .",
    "the combination of dtfe maps with wvf detected voids allow us to identify the void galaxies from the deepest interior regions of identified voids in the sdss redshift survey .",
    "the goal of this survey is to study the galaxy properties in the most underdense and most pristine environments in the universe where the evolution of galaxies is expected to progress more slowly and relatively undisturbed .",
    "our geometrically selected sample consist of small galaxies , with stellar mass less than @xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "most of these are small , blue star forming disk galaxies and many of them have companions and extended hi disks , which are often morphologically and kinematically disturbed @xcite .",
    "we have found a system of three linearly aligned galaxies , vgs_31 , in a void as part of the vgs ( figure  [ figure:1 ] and 2 ) .",
    "a remarkable feature of vgs_31 is that the whole system is embedded in a common hi envelope ( figure  [ figure:3 ] ) and the three galaxies are at almost the same velocity ( figure  [ figure:4 ] ) .",
    "the fact that there is a small velocity gradient throughout whole hi envelope , from the far east of vgs_31b to far west to vgs_31c , suggests that this is a filament in which the three galaxies are embedded .",
    "the system exhibits strong signs of interactions ( figure  [ figure:1 ] ) and star forming activity with signs of starbursts ( figure  [ figure:5 ] and  [ figure:6 ] ) .",
    "vgs_31 consists of a central galaxy vgs_31a and two companions ; vgs_31b and vgs_31c .",
    "vgs_31a is optically slightly disturbed .",
    "it has a bar like structure and all the star formation activity is concentrated there .",
    "vgs_31b is a markarian galaxy ( mrk 1477 ) .",
    "markarian galaxies are known to have uv continuum excess in their spectra .",
    "they have relatively high star formation rates and many of them contain agns and starburst nuclei .",
    "they span a wide luminosity range between -23 and -13 mag and have a broad range of morphologies .",
    "one interesting statistic is that an unusual number of markarian galaxies occur in tight pairs or interacting systems . in this context",
    ", vgs_31b is a typical example of markarian galaxy .",
    "vgs_31b is a starburst galaxy and has enhanced star formation at center of the disk mostly concentrated in the bar.it has a tail , visible both in optical and in hi and a ring like structure around the disk .",
    "there is no sign for ongoing star formation activity neither in the tail nor in the ring ( figure  [ figure:5 ] ) .",
    "vgs_31c is significantly smaller than the other two galaxies and forms stars in its central part as well .    at first glance",
    "vgs_31 looks like a normal interacting system .",
    "however the observed properties described above indicate a more complex picture as we may be witnessing the growth of structure along a filament within a large cosmological void .",
    "in fact , in an accompanying paper by rieder et al .",
    "2013 ( subm . )",
    "we have explored the dynamical evolution of the growth of systems resembling vgs_31 in voids , within the context of the @xmath4cdm cosmology . in this study",
    "we analysed the high - resolution @xmath4cdm simulation cosmo - grid @xcite to see how dark matter halo systems similar in mass , size and environment to vgs_31 came to be .",
    "we found eight systems as suitable candidates for harbouring a vgs_31 like system and then investigated their merger histories .",
    "we found that while vgs31-like systems have a large variation in formation time , the environment in which they are embedded evolved very similarly .",
    "it seems to suggest that we may be witnessing the assembly of a filament in a void by bringing together several smaller filamentary structures , each populated by individual haloes .",
    "it conjures up the interesting question whether the galaxies in the vgs_31 configuration were formed at the same location or whether they each originate from a different location .    in order to study the current properties and assembly history of the vgs_31 system in detail",
    ", we have obtained a multiwavelength data set . to investigate the low surface brightness features",
    ", we performed deep b and r band imaging , and to derive star formation properties and star formation history we have used deep @xmath0 and uv imaging .",
    "gas morphology , kinematics and molecular hydrogen content have been investigated using 21 cm hi and co observations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes the observations , data analysis and the derivation of star formation properties for vgs_31 .",

    "first we will discuss different interaction scenarios for vgs_31a and vgs_31b using the observational results presented above .",
    "vgs_31b is the most eye - catching member in the system .",
    "a one sided tidal tail and a ring like structure are clearly visible in the optical ( figure  [ figure:1 ] ) .",
    "this morphology suggests a minor merging incident with a low mass galaxy .",
    "a satellite galaxy could have left the tail and formed the ring by wrapping the disk of vgs_31b @xcite .",
    "it is less likely that the tail has been caused by tidal interaction between vgs_31b and vgs_31a .",
    "as the mass ratio of these systems is 3 to 1 one would expect greater damage to the disks and more prominent tails and counter - tail features as usually seen in tidal interactions and major mergers @xcite .",
    "the disks of vgs_31b and vgs_31a are not destroyed as expected in minor mergers @xcite .",
    "vgs_31b has a bar , visible in close up images in figure  [ figure:1 ] .",
    "the bar is pronounced in @xmath0 as well ( figure  [ figure:5 ] ) .",
    "the kinematics of the @xmath0 ( figure  [ figure:8 ] ) indicate a fast rotating inner structure and evidence for streaming motions characteristic for a bar .",
    "in addition , vgs_31b is a starburst markarian galaxy having enhanced star formation in its central part overlapping with the bar ( figure  [ figure:5 ] and  [ figure:8 ] , table  [ table:4 ] ) .",
    "the detection of co and location of vgs_31b in the bpt diagram support the starburst picture , presumably the consequence of gas accretion into its central part as seen in many galaxy mergers and interactions @xcite .",
    "there is an offset between the stellar and the gas component of the tail ( figure  [ figure:3 ] ) .",
    "this is also observed in some tidally interacting systems @xcite and may be due to different initial distributions of both components or additional processes that act on one component and not on the other ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) . on the other hand , in most of the tidal tails in mergers , ongoing star formation",
    "is observed @xcite , in the case of vgs_31b , however , no ongoing star formation has been detected neither in the tail nor in the ring ( figure  [ figure:5 ] ) .",
    "vgs_31a , however , shows different characteristics .",
    "it has no visible tails , but the internal kinematics is disturbed ( see the @xmath0 kinematics in figure  [ figure:7 ] ) and the hi shows that gas east and west of the galaxy exhibits a large spread in velocity as if there is a corotating halo filled with hi rather than tidal features with simple kinematics ( figure  [ figure:4 ] ) . like vgs_31b , vgs_31a is a starburst galaxy with enhanced star formation in its central part ( figure  [ figure:5 ] and  [ figure:6 ] , table  [ table:4 ] ) .",
    "there are two possibilities for the mechanism which could cause the enhanced star formation and the morphological disturbance : _",
    "i ) _ vgs_31a could be in interaction with vgs_31b and this may cause the disturbence in its morphology and results in the irregular @xmath0 emission line profile . _",
    "ii ) _ instead of accreting gas from vgs_31b , vgs_31a may experience steady gas infall from the intergalactic medium , presumably from the structure outlined by the location of the galaxies and the hi ` connecting ' them ( figure  [ figure:4 ] ) .",
    "this could cause the enhanced star formation as in the first scenario and better explains the broad velocity range of the hi surrounding vgs_31a .",
    "one could argue that if vgs_31a exhibits such accretion from an lss filament , then one would also expect vgs_31b to show the same characteristics . on the other hand",
    "it is conceivable that a minor merger , as suggested by the tail and ring could have disrupted the accretion process .",
    "detailed simulations of such scenarios are required to test the validity of these scenarios .",
    "vgs_31c , the smalles of the three galaxies , has enhanced star formation and its hi shows the charecteristics of interactions , albeit at very low signal to noise .",
    "it is difficult in this case to determine conclusively the process(es ) responsible for the hi structure and enhanced star formation .",
    "the most exciting result is that we may be witnessing the assembly of structure within a void , and the birth process of galaxies in such a desolate area .",
    "it does fit into the theoretically expected buildup of voids and galaxies therein .",
    "voids evolve in a hierarchical fashion , leaving planar and filamentary substructure within the emerging voids @xcite and ( rieder et al .",
    "2013 ( subm . ) ) .",
    "the question is whether we see here the manifestation of this process .",
    "vgs_31 could be a density enhancement within an underlying dark matter filament .",
    "the complication is that in addition to accretion of material from a lss filament the galaxies also suffer from tidal interactions and minor merging . as for the cold flow accretion scenarios we can only make a very rough estimate because we do nt know exactly the orientation of the system .",
    "if we take the size of the hi filament and the velocity gradient from east to west then we can estimate a rough accretion timescale of at least a gigayear .",
    "an important next step will be to use advanced simulations with gas and star formation to see whether the scenario proposed here does indeed take place in voids .    finally , it is of interest to note that vgs_31 is not the only case for a filamentary structure and cold flow accretion in our void galaxy survey .",
    "we have discovered at least two other cases which seem to exhibit this hierarchical structure formation .",
    "in addition to another filamentary galaxy configuration , vgs_38 @xcite , we also found a polar disk galaxy , vgs_12 @xcite .",
    "vgs_38 is a system of chain galaxies which share the same hi .",
    "vgs_12 is located right at the center of a tenuous wall between two large voids .",
    "it has a polar hi disk much more extended than its stellar disk .",
    "the polar disk has no stellar counterpart or any ongoing star formation .",
    "this galaxy is a candidate for the cold flow accretion .",
    "individually these galaxies and vgs_31 are unusual systems , however taken collectively they show that the void environment is an extremely interesting site for understanding galaxy formation and evolution .",
