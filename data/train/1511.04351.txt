    "the national basketball association ( nba ) launched a public database in september 2013 containing over 80 new statistics captured by stats llc through their innovative sportvu player tracking camera systems@xcite .",
    "the cameras capture and record the location of players on the court as well as the location of the ball , and the data are used to derive many different interesting and useful stats that expand greatly upon the traditional stats available for analysis of basketball performance .",
    "we can now break down shot attempts and points by shot selection ( e.g. driving shots , catch and shoot shots , pull up shots ) , assess rebounding ability for contested and uncontested boards , and even look at completely new statistics like average speed and distance and opponent field goal percentage at the rim .",
    "the availability of such data enables fans and analysts to dig into the data and uncover insights previously not possible due to the limited nature of the data at hand .",
    "+ for example , techniques to uncover different positions based on grouping statistical profiles have become increasingly popular .",
    "it reflects the mindset of current nba coaches and general managers who are very much aware of the different types of players beyond the five traditional roles , but a recent proposal@xcite has received criticism for its unintuitive groupings and inability to separate out the impact of player talent@xcite .",
    "the nba player tracking data has the ability to differentiate player performance across more dimensions than before ( e.g. shot selection , possession time , physical activity , etc . ) which can provide better ways to evaluate the uniqueness and similarities across nba player abilities and playing styles .",
    "additionally , many research methods for basketball analysis rely on estimation of possessions and other stats to produce offensive and defensive ratings@xcite . with the ability to track players time of possession and proximity to players in possession of the ball through player tracking",
    ", we can develop more accurate representations of possessions and better player offensive and defensive efficiency metrics .",
    "+ however , the high dimensionality of this new data source can be troublesome as it demands more computational resources and reduces the ability to easily analyze and interpret findings .",
    "we must find a way to reduce the dimensionality of the data set while retaining the ability to differentiate and compare player performance .",
    "one method that is particularly well - suited for this application is principal component analysis ( pca ) which identifies the dimensions of the data containing the maximum variance in the data set .",
    "this article applies pca to the nba player tracking data to discover four principal components that account for 68% of the variability in the data for the 2013 - 2014 regular season .",
    "these components are explored in detail by examining the player tracking statistics that influence them the most and where players and teams fall along these new dimensions .",
    "+ in addition to exploring player and team performances through the principal components , a simple measure of similarity in statistical profiles between players and teams based on the principal components is proposed .",
    "the statistical diversity index ( sdi ) can be calculated for any pairwise player combination and provides a fast and intuitive method for finding players with similar statistical performances along any or all of the principal component dimensions .",
    "this approach is also advantageous from the standpoint of scalability .",
    "the possibilities to derive new statistics from the player tracking data are endless , so as new statistics emerge , this approach can again be applied using the new and existing data to reconstruct the principal components and sdi for improved player evaluation and comparisons .",
    "+ numerous applications in personnel management exist for the use of sdi and the principal component scores in evaluating and comparing player and team statistical performances .",
    "two specific case studies are presented to show how these tools can be used to quickly identify players with similar statistical profiles to a certain player of interest for the purpose of identifying less expensive , similarly skilled players or finding suitable replacement options for a key role player within the organization . +",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : data ] describes the player tracking data and data processing .",
    "section [ sec : pca ] provides the analysis and interpretations for the four principal components in detail , showing how players and teams can be compared across these new dimensions .",
    "section [ sec : sdi ] introduces the calculation for sdi and two case studies where principal component scores and sdi are used to find players with similar statistical profiles to all - star tony parker and role player anthony morrow for personnel management purposes .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the article with final remarks .",
    "currently , there are over 90 new player tracking statistics , and data for all 482 nba players from the 2013 - 2014 regular season are available .",
    "separate records exist for players who played for different teams throughout the season , including a record for overall performance across all teams .",
    "brief descriptions of the newly available statistics adapted from the nba player tracking statistics website@xcite are provided for reference and will be helpful in better understanding the analysis going forward .",
    "+ * shooting * + traditional shooting statistics are now available for different shot types :    * _ pull up shots _ - shots taken 10 feet away from the basket where player takes 1 or more dribbles prior to shooting * _ driving shots _ - shots taken where player starts 20 or more feet away from the basket and dribbles less than 10 feet away from the basket prior to shooting * _ catch and shoot shots _ - shots taken at least 10 feet away from the basket where player possessed the ball for less than 2 seconds and took no dribbles prior to shooting    * assists * + new assist categories are available that enhance understanding of offensive contribution :    * _ assist opportunities _ - passes by a player to another player who attempts a shot and if made would be an assist * _ secondary assists _ - passes by a player to another player who receives an assist * _ free throw assists _ - passes by a player to another player who was fouled , missed the shot if shooting , and made at least one free throw * _ points created by assists _ - points created by a player through his assists    * touches * + location of possessions provides insight into style of play and scoring efficiency :    * _ front court touches _ - touches on his team s offensive half of the court * _ close touches _ - touches that originate within 12 feet of the basket excluding drives * _ elbow touches _ - touches that originate within 5 feet of the edge of the lane and the free throw line inside the 3-point line * _ points per touch _ - points scored by a player per touch    * rebounding * + new rebounding statistics incorporate location and proximity of opponents :    * _ contested rebound _ - rebounds where an opponent is within 3.5 feet of the rebound * _ rebounding opportunity _ - when a player is within 3.5 feet of a rebound * _ rebounding percentage _ - rebounds over rebounding opportunities    * rim protection * + when a player is within 5 feet of the basket and within 5 feet of the offensive shooter , opponents shooting statistics are available to measure how well a player can protect the basket .    *",
    "speed and distance * + players average speeds and distances traveled per game are also captured and broken out by offensive and defensive plays",
    ".      only players who played at least half the 2013 - 2014 regular season , 41 games , are included in this analysis .",
    "this restriction is made to reduce the influence of player statistics derived from only a few games played .",
    "also fields containing season total statistics and per game statistics are dropped from the analysis since they could be influenced by number of games and minutes played throughout the season . instead , per 48 minutes , per touch , and per shot statistics are used .",
    "the final data set contains 360 player records each containing 66 different player tracking statistics .",
    "with numerous player tracking statistics already available and the potential to develop infinitely many more , it is increasingly difficult to extract meaningful and intuitive insights on player comparisons .",
    "now that the data are available for more granular and detailed comparisons , a methodology is needed that can analyze the entirety of the data set to extract a handful of dimensions for comparisons .",
    "these dimensions should be constructed in a way that ensures optimality in differentiating players ( i.e. dimensions should retain the maximum amount of player separability possible from the original data ) and can be understood in terms of the original statistics .",
    "+ principal component analysis ( pca ) , developed by karl pearson in 1901@xcite and later by hotelling in 1933@xcite , is a particularly well - suited statistical tool that can accomplish this task through identifying uncorrelated linear combinations of player tracking statistics that contain maximum variance .",
    "interested readers can find a brief technical introduction to pca in appendix [ app : pcaintro ] .",
    "components of high variance help us to better differentiate player performance in these directions in hopes that the majority of the variance will be contained in a small subset of components .",
    "this simple and intuitive approach to dimension reduction provides a platform for player comparisons across dimensions that best separate players by statistical performance and can be implemented without expensive proprietary solutions , providing more visibility into how the method works at little to no additional cost .",
    "pca is sensitive to different variable scalings in the original data set such that variables with larger variances may dominate the principal components if not adjusted . to set every statistic on equal footing",
    ", all statistics are standardized with mean 0 and variance 1 prior to conducting the analysis .",
    "+ pca is most useful when the majority of the total variance across variables are captured by only a few of the principal components , thus the dimension reduction .",
    "if this is the case for the nba player tracking data set , it means that we are able to retain the ability to differentiate player performance without having to operate in such a high dimensional space .",
    "figure [ fig : scree ] shows the variance captured by each principal component .",
    "note the variance captured in the first principal component is very high and decreases drastically through the first four components .",
    "after that , the change in variance is relatively flat , forming an elbow shape in the plot .",
    "this means that the variances captured by the fifth component onward are very similar and much smaller than the first four components .",
    "moreover , the first four components capture 68% of the variance across the original variables , so we utilize these four components going forward to analyze and compare player performance and playing styles .",
    "each principal component ( pc ) is a linear combination of the original variables in the dataset .",
    "there is a vector for each principal component containing the coefficients associated with each of the variables in the original data set and are called _ loading vectors_. these describe the influence of each variable for each principal component and are used to interpret these new dimensions in terms of the original variables .",
    "figure [ fig : pcload ] plots the categorized loading coefficients for the four principal components and is explored in detail in the following sections .",
    "variables can have a positive or negative contribution to the principal component . while the sign is arbitrary , understanding which variables contribute positively or negatively can help with interpreting the principal components .",
    "the most important statistics for each component are presented in the following sections , but tables containing all loading coefficients for variables contributing significantly to the principal components are also available in appendix [ app : loadings ] for more details .",
    "+ each player can then be given a set of pc scores by multiplying the standardized statistics by their corresponding loading coefficients and then taking a sum ( see appendix [ app : pcaintro ] for details ) .",
    "figure [ fig : pcscore ] contains plots of the pc scores for all players with a select few noted for illustration . using the loading and score plots here",
    ", we can begin to understand and interpret what these new dimensions are capturing and use them for player comparisons .",
    "the first principal component accounts for the most variation , 42% of the total variance .",
    "table [ tab : pc1top ] lists statistics with highly positive and negative loadings for pc 1 , and refer back to figure [ fig : pcload ] for categorized pc 1 loadings for all statistics .",
    "these are used to better understand the meaning of the scores along this dimension .",
    "players with positive scores for pc 1 are able to secure rebounds of all kinds and are responsible for defending the rim and close shots .",
    "notable examples are andre drummond , deandre jordan , and omer asik . while players with negative scores for pc 1 drive the basketball to the hoop and take pull up and catch and shoot shots often , which implies they tend to be outside players .",
    "these players also tend to possess the ball more often and generate additional offense through assists .",
    "examples here are stephen curry , tony parker , and chris paul .",
    "pc 2 accounts for another 12% of the total variance and table [ tab : pc2top ] lists statistics with highly positive and negative loadings . also refer to figure [ fig : pcload ] for categorized pc 2 loading coefficients .",
    "players with positive pc 2 scores generate offense mainly through assists and driving shots .",
    "these players tend to possess the ball often and either kick the ball to teammates for shot attempts or drive the ball to the basket .",
    "many point guards fall into this category with examples like ricky rubio , tony parker , and chris paul .",
    "players with negative pc 2 scores provide offense primarily through catch and shoot shots and are very efficient scorers , especially from behind the 3-point arc .",
    "primary examples are klay thompson , kyle korver , and anthony morrow .",
    "table [ tab : pc3top ] lists statistics with highly positive and negative loadings for pc 3 which explains 9% of the total variance .",
    "also refer to figure [ fig : pcload ] for categorized pc 3 loading coefficients .",
    "players with positive pc 3 scores are extremely quick on both sides of the ball and cover a lot of ground while on the court .",
    "some examples are ish smith , shane larkin , and dennis schroder .",
    "players with negative pc 3 scores are largely responsible for scoring when on the court and provide a significant amount of offensive production per 48 minutes .",
    "scoring and rebounding efficiency characterize many of the superstars in the nba with players like kevin durant , carmelo anthony , and lebron james touting highly negative pc 3 scores .",
    "table [ tab : pc4top ] lists statistics with highly positive and negative loadings for pc 4 which accounts for another 4% of the total variance .",
    "also refer to figure [ fig : pcload ] for categorized loading coefficients for pc 4 .",
    "this component is characterized by players tendencies when they receive possession of the ball .",
    "players with positive pc 4 scores tend to pass or convert catch and shoot shots when the ball goes their way ( e.g. kevin love , spencer hawes , and patty mills ) while players with negative pc 4 scores tend to drive the ball and score efficiently when they get touches ( e.g. tyreke evans , rodney stuckey , and tony wroten ) .      not only can we characterize players by principal components , but teams can also be profiled along these new dimensions as well .",
    "there are numerous ways to aggregate the player pc scores to form a team - level score , but here a simple weighted average is used .",
    "the @xmath0th team pc score , @xmath1 , can be found by taking an average of the @xmath0th pc scores across the @xmath2 players weighted by the minutes played throughout the season , @xmath3 .",
    "figure [ fig : pcscoreteam ] shows the distribution of all nba teams across these dimensions as well as their corresponding 2013 - 2014 regular season winning percentage .",
    "this view is useful in seeing the differences and similarities in team playing styles and how they impact success .",
    "+   + for example , the new york knicks had an extremely negative pc 2 score .",
    "further investigation shows it is partially the result of catch and shoot offense from j.r .",
    "smith , andrea bargnani , and tim hardaway jr . who were all in the top 50 in catch and shoot points per 48 minutes",
    "however , another major factor is that 8 of the 12 new york players were below average in passes per 48 minutes ( average was 58 passes per 48 minutes ) which is indicative of poor ball movement .",
    "all - star carmelo anthony is in this group and has long been labeled a `` ball hog''@xcite which is supported by his below average passing and above average number of touches and scoring .",
    "in fact , anthony s top 10 performance in points per 48 minutes , points per touch , and rebounding efficiency helped earn his team the most negative pc 3 team average score .",
    "note that team average pc 3 score is negatively correlated with winning percentage , yet the knicks won only 37 games and failed to make the playoffs .      to better understand how these team average pc scores impact winning , table [ tab : reg ] contains the results from a multiple linear regression analysis on winning percentage .",
    "note that negative pc 3 scores are highly correlated with winning while positive pc 2 and pc 4 scores are also highly correlated with winning .",
    "negative pc 3 scores are associated with high average scoring and rebounding efficiency .",
    "referring back to tables [ tab : pc2top ] and [ tab : pc4top ] , passes , touches , and assists contribute positively to pc 2 and pc 4 scores .",
    "regarding new york s lackluster season , it seems that anthony s great offensive production was not enough to offset the negative impact of extremely poor passing and ball movement ."
