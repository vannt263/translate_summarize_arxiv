    "coronal gas traced by is intermediate in temperature between the very hot ( @xmath16  k ) x - ray emitting gas and the warm ( @xmath17  k ) ionized medium .",
    "opportunities to observe the lines have been limited .",
    "the first observations of were made with the _ copernicus _ satellite along sight lines toward nearby bright stars ( @xmath18 , d @xmath19  pc ) @xcite .",
    "later observations were possible with the orfeus - spas missions @xcite .",
    "these observations , combined with observations of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , have built upon the original idea of a galactic corona of hot gas which provides pressure confinement for high - latitude clouds @xcite .",
    "while results for , , and have greatly increased our understanding of the galactic corona , the relative lack of information on has been frustrating , since it probes a hotter temperature range and is less likely to be produced by photoionization .    with the launch of the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _ in 1999 @xcite , access to the lines has returned .",
    "@xmath0  is much more sensitive than _ copernicus _ , allowing more distant stars and extragalactic sources to be observed .",
    "one of the major science goals of @xmath0  is to study the properties and distribution of hot gas in the local universe through absorption .",
    "early results have already been published for the galactic halo and high velocity clouds @xcite , and more comprehensive surveys are in progress .",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath0  makes it possible to observe early type stars in the magellanic clouds , so we can now study the absorption in galaxies with different properties than our own .",
    "the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) has properties that are vastly different from the milky way .",
    "it has low mass , low metallicity , and it is currently undergoing a gravitational interaction with two more massive galaxies .",
    "these factors may influence the properties of hot gas in the ism of the smc .",
    "the hot gas in the smc has been studied previously using _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) _",
    "spectra @xcite .",
    "absorption by and was measured toward the nine stars studied by @xcite , who found evidence for a global component of highly ionized gas .",
    "more recently , space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) spectra of one of the sight lines studied by @xcite , av229 ( hd 5980 ) , were analyzed by @xcite and @xcite , who also found evidence for hot gas in a supernova remnant in addition to the general ism .",
    "the spectra show absorption by in addition to and .",
    "@xmath0  data on toward sk  108 in the smc has already been analyzed by @xcite , but the complicated stellar continuum prevented an accurate determination of the column density . @xcite and @xcite discovered an x - ray halo around the smc using _ einstein _ data , with spectral properties that suggest the presence of hot , thermal ism components .",
    "in this paper we present the results of a @xmath0   absorption survey of 18 stars in the smc . by observing stars in a variety of environments in the smc",
    ", we search for a global component of hot gas , as well as clues to the origins of the highly ionized gas . in section 2",
    "we describe the observations and data processing .",
    "section 3 describes the content of the smc , its variation with location , and a comparison to the milky way .",
    "the kinematics of the absorbing gas are described in section 4 , and section 5 contains a discussion of the observed absorption .",
    "section 6 summarizes the primary conclusions of our study . in a parallel effort , @xcite present a study of absorption in the large magellanic cloud",
    "we obtained fuse spectra of early type stars in 18 locations in the smc .",
    "table 1 lists the names and properties of the stars used in this project . for information on the local interstellar environment of these stars , see @xcite .",
    "the star names are from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the ngc  346 identifiers are from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and the new spectral type for ngc346@xmath233 is from @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the @xmath0  observations are given in table 2 .",
    "all of the spectra were taken through the large ( lwrs ) apertures , which are 30@xmath24@xmath2530@xmath24  in size .",
    "the @xmath0  instrument consists of four channels , two optimized for short ultraviolet wavelengths ( sic1 and sic2 : 9051100 ) and two optimized for longer ultraviolet wavelengths ( lif1 and lif2 : 10001187 ) .",
    "the lines are covered by all four channels , but the lif1 channel is the most sensitive ; it is the primary channel considered here , although all of the results were verified with the lif2 data .",
    "because of fixed pattern features in the detectors , we required that any absorption line be present in these two channels to be considered a real feature .",
    "the lif1 spectra in the wavelength region containing the lines are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the raw time - tagged photon event lists for each individual exposure were combined and run through the standard @xmath0  calibration pipeline ( calfuse v1.8.7 ) available at johns hopkins university .",
    "the pipeline screens data for passage through the south atlantic anomaly and low earth limb angle pointings and corrects for thermal drift of the gratings , thermally induced changes in the detector read - out circuitry , and doppler shifts due to the orbital motion of the satellite .",
    "finally the pipeline subtracts a constant detector background and applies wavelength and flux calibration .",
    "the velocity zero - point was set by shifting the spectrum so that the milky way component of the h@xmath26 and low ionization lines lie at a local standard of rest ( lsr ) velocity of 0kms@xmath13 , based on the results of @xcite .",
    "the spectra were binned by three pixels ( @xmath276kms@xmath13  near ) , and the nominal resolution of the data is @xmath2720kms@xmath13  ( fwhm ) .",
    "the wavelength solution is accurate to @xmath276kms@xmath13  on average , although deviations of 1015kms@xmath13  may exist over small regions of the spectrum .",
    "the four sight lines in ngc  346 present an additional complication .",
    "the four stars @xmath0  observed are separated by only a few arcseconds , so the light of all four stars , and perhaps others , entered the lwrs apertures and is present in the spectrum of each star .",
    "the resultant spectra are blends of several stars , with broadened absorption features due to the positional offsets of the sources in the apertures .",
    "the four spectra in this region look very similar , with minor differences probably caused by shifting a small number of fainter stars in or out of the aperture at the different pointings .",
    "although we analyzed each sight line separately , the reader should recognize that the results for these four sight lines are correlated .",
    "when determining global properties of the smc or milky way , we averaged the results for these four sight lines , and treated them as one measurement . in a future paper",
    "we will report on new @xmath0  observations of the ngc  346 stars using smaller apertures to isolate the individual stars .",
    "equivalents widths and column densities were measured using the procedures described by @xcite .",
    "the total column densities were derived by summing the apparent optical depth over the velocity range of the 1031.93    line .",
    "the 1037.62    line was blended with other lines in all of the spectra , rendering it useless for determining column densities .",
    "the apparent optical depth method is valid as long as there is no unresolved saturated structure in the line .",
    "the high temperatures required for would result in a thermal line width of @xmath28  kms@xmath13(fwhm ) , larger than the @xmath0  line spread function width ( @xmath29  kms@xmath13 ) , so the lines should be resolved .",
    "no saturated lines were seen in the @xmath0  data , so we conclude that the absorption is optically thin .",
    "uncertainties in the equivalent widths and column densities were evaluated very conservatively .",
    "for each spectrum we first placed a nominal continuum over the 1031.93    line by fitting low order ( @xmath30 ) legendre polynomials to the nearby stellar continuum .",
    "continuum error estimates were calculated according to the prescription outlined by @xcite .",
    "however , due the high degree of continuum curvature and systematic uncertainties caused by possible stellar absorption near some of the profiles , we explored a wider range of parameter space in the continuum fits than was suggested by the formal ( objective ) approach . to do this",
    "we varied the continuum fit to the most extreme values above and below the nominal fit that were still reasonable continuations of the nearby continuum .",
    "these bracketing continuum placements are shown in figure 1 as dashed lines , while the nominal fits are shown as solid lines .",
    "while this method adds a more subjective element to the evaluation of uncertainties , the potentially drastic effect of errors in the continuum placement justify such a conservative approach .",
    "we used the 6 - 0  p(3 ) 1031.20    and 6 - 0  r(4 ) 1032.35    lines of h@xmath26 , which are close to the line , to test whether the continuum fits were reasonable . to do this",
    "we fit a gaussian function to nearby h@xmath26 lines from the same rotational level having similar values of @xmath31 , and plotted the fits at the positions of the h@xmath26 lines near .",
    "the fits are plotted in figure 2 , which show the continuum - normalized lines using the nominal continuum fits . in most cases",
    "the fits matched the observed lines using the nominal continuum fit . in some of the spectra",
    "there is a stellar feature that falls on the 6 - 0  p(3 ) 1031.195    line ( @xmath32 , av378 ) .",
    "this feature appears to be correlated in strength with another feature at @xmath33   .",
    "other cases where the h@xmath26 line fit did not match the data are discussed below .",
    "all measurements were carried out using the three continuum fits in order to evaluate the uncertainties resulting from errors in the continuum placement .",
    "the presence of variable features in the stellar winds of the stars can cause substantial errors in the derived column densities by affecting the continuum placement @xcite .",
    "we have not made any attempt to correct for this directly , but the sample was defined by choosing stars that appeared to have relatively simple continua around the 1032    line .    the h@xmath26 model for av69 did not match the 6 - 0  r(4 ) 1032.351  line .",
    "this star has a peculiar metallicity , which can affect the shape of the stellar wind lines @xcite . to test the hypothesis that the peculiar wind lines have compromised our continuum fit ,",
    "we have examined the stis spectrum of av69 , along with eight other stars in the @xmath0  sample that have been observed by stis @xcite . while the lines show a normal p - cygni wind profile , the lines have very weak and relatively narrow wind profiles @xcite .",
    "if the stellar wind profile is shaped similarly , it would hinder the measurement of the interstellar .",
    "this would explain the lack of agreement between the h@xmath26 model and the observed spectrum .",
    "these tests lead us to distrust the interstellar column density measured toward av69 , which would be the largest in the smc if the continuum fit were correct .",
    "the h@xmath26 models for av14 and av26 also did not match the observed spectra well .",
    "unfortunately these two stars have not been observed by stis , so we can not be sure if there is contamination by stellar absorption .",
    "absorption by in the smc at high velocities could also produce this effect .",
    "nevertheless , these sight lines are suspicious , and while the measurements are included with those of the other sight lines , the reader is warned to interpret the results for these three stars with caution . for global properties we computed averages both with and without av14 and av26 .",
    "av69 is not included in the global averages as it is clearly not reliable .",
    "a nominal velocity integration range was chosen for the milky way and smc components of in each spectrum .",
    "we chose the velocity of the point of lowest apparent optical depth between the two components to be the boundary for the integration limits .",
    "if the two components are described by overlapping gaussian functions , the approach could shift some of the column density from the stronger component to the weaker component .",
    "tests using gaussian fits to several of the sight lines revealed that this effect is @xmath343% in the worst cases , and @xmath341% in typical cases . to account for this effect , as well as possible h@xmath26 absorption on either side of the 1032.93    line",
    ", we varied the velocity integration limits by @xmath35  kms@xmath13  so that the total integration range was 10  kms@xmath13  larger or smaller than the nominal limits .",
    "the variation in column density found with this method was greater than the effect of the overlapping gaussian profiles .",
    "this uncertainty was combined with the fixed - pattern noise uncertainty in the @xmath0  spectra .",
    "the measured equivalent widths and column densities for the milky way and the smc components are listed in tables 3 and 4 .",
    "the first quoted uncertainty is that due to fixed pattern noise and velocity range errors , and the second shows the effects of varying the continuum placement ( as indicated in figure 1 ) , which in the majority of cases is the dominant source of uncertainty .",
    "it is immediately clear from the spectra shown in figures 1 and 2 that the absorption from the smc is usually much stronger than that in the milky way along the same line of sight .",
    "is detected in both the milky way and the smc along every smc sight line observed by @xmath0 , including the sight line toward sk  188 , which is in the periphery of the smc .",
    "this suggests that a widespread component of coronal temperature gas is present in the smc .",
    "the measured equivalent widths , column densities , line widths , and positions are given in tables 3 and 4 for the galactic and smc absorption , respectively .",
    "figure 3 shows the locations of the @xmath0  targets on an h@xmath36 image of the smc @xcite .",
    "the stars are marked with circles denoting the column density , and are labeled by the identification number from table 1 .",
    "the largest star - forming region in the smc is ngc  346 , in the northern part of the galaxy at the location of star 8 in figure 3 .",
    "four of the targets are in this region , and several others lie close to it .",
    "there is another concentration of regions in the southwest corner of the smc , also sampled by several @xmath0  sight lines .",
    "the central and the southeastern parts of the galaxy are much less actively forming stars .",
    "the southeastern extension is sometimes called the `` wing '' , while the northern and southwestern parts make up the `` bar . ''",
    "most of the star formation in the smc is occurring in the bar @xcite .",
    "the largest column densities occur near the star - forming regions .",
    "figure 4 shows the distribution of log @xmath5 ( ) with distance from ngc  346 .",
    "the column toward av229 ( sk  78 , hd5980 ) is the highest ( excluding av69 , which may be compromised by stellar absorption ) , with log @xmath5()=@xmath37 .",
    "the sight line to av229 passes through a supernova remnant ( snr ) in the smc @xcite , which contributes roughly one third of the total column @xcite .",
    "even if the contribution of the snr is excluded , the column is one of the highest in the smc , with log @xmath5()=14.68 .",
    "av229 is on the edge of ngc  346 , and high columns are seen toward stars in and around this region ( av232 and the ngc  346 stars ) .",
    "the stars outside of ngc  346 in the northern end of the bar are markedly lower , however .",
    "the column toward av321 ( star 12 ) is still relatively high , but the value for av378 ( star 13 ) is low compared to most of the other stars in the sample .",
    "the highest points outside of ngc  346 are the points in the star - forming regions in the southwestern end of the bar , marked by open circles in figure 4 .",
    "the three highest values in this direction are found for av69 , av14 , and av26 , all of which may be contaminated by stellar absorption and are not shown in figure 4 .",
    "if these are left out , three of the remaining sight lines in this area ( av95 , av75 , and av15 , stars 7 , 5 , and 2 ) still show large columns , but not as large as those near ngc  346 , and one star ( av83 , star 6 ) is fairly low . the regions in this part of the smc are not forming stars as actively ngc  346 , based on their h@xmath36 luminosity @xcite .",
    "the columns toward stars in the central and southeastern parts of the smc ( av235 , av423 , and sk  188 , stars 11,14 , and 15 ) are lower than those in the other parts of the galaxy .",
    "these regions have much less star formation occurring @xcite . while the columns are lower , they are still as high as the milky way component along the same sight lines .",
    "this is evidence for an extended component of in the smc , which is locally enhanced by processes related to star formation , such as snrs .",
    "the column density of hot gas in the smc rivals that of the milky way halo even in the absence of local enhancement , which is perhaps surprising in a small galaxy with low metallicity .    in figure 4 the stars in and around ngc  346",
    "stand out from the rest of the points .",
    "if these points are excluded , the mean column density in the smc is log @xmath5()@xmath38 .",
    "this is about 1.4 times higher than the mean value of the column density perpendicular to the milky way plane of log @xmath39()@xmath40 @xcite .",
    "not including the contribution from the snr toward av229 , the column densities toward the ngc  346 stars , av229 , and av232 are all very similar , almost identical within the uncertainties of the measurements ( counting the ngc  346 stars as a single measurement ) . in the rest of the smc",
    "there is more variation in the column , in one case a factor of 2 difference between stars only a few arcminutes apart ( av83 and av95 , stars 6 and 7 ) , which is about the same as the distance between the stars near ngc  346 .",
    "the standard deviation in the column densities is about 27% ( excluding the ngc  346 stars , av229 , and av232 ) , which is somewhat lower than the deviation seen in the milky way @xcite . in general",
    ", the column density appears to vary on both large and small scales , with the exception being the smooth distribution near ngc  346 .",
    "we calculated the first and second moments of the 1031.93    absorption line profiles in the milky way and the smc .",
    "the first moment gives the average velocity of the line ( weighted by the data values ) and the second moment gives the line width , equivalent to the standard deviation ( @xmath41 ) if the line is gaussian in shape .",
    "the line widths given in tables 2 and 3 were converted to fwhm values by multiplying by 2.35 .",
    "an initial concern was that measurement of these quantities would be hindered by the blending of the smc and milky way components . in most cases the blue edge of the smc absorption and the red edge of the milky way absorption were chosen as the midpoint of the shoulder between the two absorption peaks .",
    "since part of the low - velocity end of the line profile is missing due to blending , the measured positions of the smc lines may be weighted toward higher velocities . however , comparison of the position measured in this manner with the visually determined absorption minimum revealed that such an effect did not occur , or was too small to be seen .",
    "the lines in the smc are broader than the milky way lines .",
    "the fwhm ranges from @xmath42  kms@xmath13  with a mean of @xmath43  kms@xmath13 , compared to the mean @xmath44  kms@xmath13  for the milky way line widths ( which range from 40 to 66  kms@xmath13 ) .",
    "neither the ngc  346 stars nor av69 were included in the mean values .",
    "the smc mean line width corresponds to a temperature @xmath45  k if the width is due to thermal broadening alone , while the milky way mean line width corresponds to @xmath46  k. in collisional ionization equilibrium , peaks in abundance at @xmath47  k @xcite .",
    "if most of the gas is at this temperature , then either large non - thermal motions are required to contribute to the line broadening , or there are multiple components of absorption in both galaxies .",
    "figure 5 compares the line profiles to those of @xmath48 . in many of the sight lines",
    "there are two low ionization absorption complexes in the smc , a feature also seen in @xmath49 spectra @xcite and 21 cm studies @xcite .",
    "most of the absorption from the low ionization gas occurs in the lower velocity ( @xmath50  kms@xmath13 ) component @xcite .",
    "the higher velocity ( @xmath51  kms@xmath13 ) component is most prominent in the southwest part of the bar , and is not visible in the spectra of stars near ngc  346 .",
    "the spectrum of av423 does not show the double peaked profile , but the absorption is as wide as that in the av235 spectrum , where the double peaked profile is strong .",
    "thus , it is possible that both components are present but saturated toward av423 .",
    "this is not the case toward sk  188 , although the line is asymmetric toward the red side .",
    "sk  188 is on the far eastern part of the smc , quite isolated from the other stars in the sample .    the absorption appears to lie close to the velocity of the @xmath52  kms@xmath13  component of low - ionization absorption in those sight lines where this component is visible , although there are a few cases where the absorption peaks between the two components ( av26 , av14 , av15 ) , and there are cases near ngc  346 where the peak is redward of both components ( av321 , av378 ) . in several cases ( av378 ,",
    "av321 , av83 , and av95 ) there may be structure in the absorption corresponding to the two low ionization components , although the bulk of the absorption is still redward of the main low ionization component at @xmath53kms@xmath13 . in the sight lines where the @xmath52kms@xmath13  low ionization component is not visible ,",
    "the is still systematically shifted to higher velocities than the main component of low ionization absorption .",
    "this indicates that the absorbing gas has physically distinct properties from the gas producing most of the low ionization absorption .",
    "the observations described in this paper form a picture in which the smc has a substantial , widespread component of hot gas . on average the column density in the smc is @xmath54 times that of the average column density perpendicular to the plane of the milky way of log @xmath39()@xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the distribution of hot gas in the smc appears to be strongly influenced locally by nearby star formation .",
    "the largest column densities are measured along sight lines in or near star - forming regions .",
    "the distribution of hot gas is strongly affected by star formation in ngc  346 , in particular , where the column density is @xmath54 times higher than the average for the rest of the smc . the column density in the smc _ excluding _",
    "ngc  346 is @xmath56 times larger than the galactic average .",
    "comparisons between the smc and the milky way can be misleading because the two galaxies have vastly different structures .",
    "it is not clear that the smc can be described as a planar system , in which an inclination correction would be necessary .",
    "the system of carbon stars in the smc has been modeled as a plane with an inclination of 73@xmath57 @xcite . if this inclination holds for the hot gas component of the smc , then log @xmath4()@xmath58 , and if ngc  346 is excluded log @xmath4()@xmath59 .",
    "the smc exhibits evidence for a large depth , with estimates ranging from 3.3 to 14 kpc ( see _ e.g. _ , welch et al .",
    "1987 ; groenewegen 2000 ) , with some estimates as high as 32 kpc @xcite .",
    "the depth , optical appearance , and the double - peaked velocity profiles suggest that a simple planar model is not applicable .",
    "if the structure of the smc is truly irregular , it is probably more appropriate to use the total column density , with no correction for inclination , for comparison with the milky way .",
    "multiple supernovae and stellar winds associated with regions are a likely mechanism to produce the enhanced seen near star - forming regions in the smc .",
    "supernovae are thought to produce much of the hot gas in galaxies @xcite , and one supernova remnant observed by @xmath0  contains a large amount of @xcite . in the milky way , is higher than the galactic average on the sight line to 3c  273 , which probes the supernova remnant loop iv @xcite , although it is not enhanced above the scutum supershell @xcite .",
    "several giant regions contain x - ray emitting gas , so they probably contain coronal phase gas as well @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the average column density for the smc may appear high compared to the milky way because several of the smc sight lines pass through star - forming regions , while the milky way sight lines to extragalactic sources typically do not .",
    "one might expect the low metallicity of the smc to result in a lower abundance .",
    "however , @xcite found that the metallicity has little effect on the column density of hot , radiatively cooling gas because the lower abundance is compensated by a longer cooling time .",
    "if the in the smc arises in radiatively cooling hot gas , our results confirm that low oxygen abundance does not reduce the abundance .",
    "in fact , it is conceivable that the lower cooling efficiency could result in more hot gas , and thus a higher observed column density .",
    "this was suggested by @xcite to explain the soft x - ray halo .",
    "the @xmath53  kms@xmath13  component of low - ionization gas is most often interpreted as being in front of the @xmath52  kms@xmath13  component ( see danforth et al .",
    "2002 ) . extending this interpretation to the absorbing gas",
    "would mean that it is behind most of the cooler gas .",
    "this interpretation is unsatisfactory for several reasons .",
    "the is seen at higher velocities than the bulk of the low ionization material in nearly every sight line , requiring that every star in the sample be associated with the weaker of the low ionization components . in ngc  346 ,",
    "where the @xmath52  kms@xmath13  low ionization component is not visible , the is still redshifted compared to the low ionization gas .",
    "there is no correlation between the strength of the @xmath52  kms@xmath13  component and the column density ; for example , the high velocity component is much more pronounced in the av83 spectrum than in av15 , yet the column toward av15 is @xmath60 times higher than toward av83 .",
    "a correlation might be expected if the low ionization and high ionization gas are cospatial . in many of the spectra",
    "the does not fall at the same velocity as the @xmath52  kms@xmath13  component .",
    "although these facts do not preclude a physical association between the and the @xmath52  kms@xmath13  low - ionization component , it is also possible that the similarity of their velocity distributions is coincidental .",
    "@xcite suggest that the appearance of two components in the smc is due to the presence of shells and supershells along the line of sight , not due to distinct cloud complexes making up the smc . in this scenario",
    "the hot gas seen in absorption could lie between the two apparent components in velocity space if it fills the interior of the shells .",
    "if these shells are most numerous along the bar where the star formation is concentrated , it would naturally explain the higher column densities measured there .",
    "to test this idea we examined the sight lines that fall within shells listed in the catalog of @xcite .",
    "these sight lines are : av75 , av83 , and av95 in the southwest ( stars 8 , 9 , and 10 ) , and av321 and av378 in the north ( stars 12 and 13 ) .",
    "there are also shells in the direction of av14 , av26 , and av69 , but we do not discuss these due to their uncertain profiles .",
    "all of these sight lines are in the bar , but there are other sight lines in the bar and elsewhere in the smc that do not pass through any catalogued shell .",
    "@xcite point out that shells may have been missed in regions with complex distribution . for the sight lines in the direction of a shell",
    ", the shell velocities usually correspond to the peak of the absorption , although not in every case ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "however , on all five sight lines there is significant absorption outside of the velocity range of the expanding shells .",
    "furthermore , many of the sight lines are not in the direction of any shell .",
    "we conclude that hot gas in expanding shells produces some of the absorption , but the bulk is produced in gas outside of the shells .",
    "a galactic fountain might also explain the observations .",
    "in this scenario correlated supernovae produce a flow of very hot gas into the halo , which then cools and falls back on the main body of the galaxy .",
    "absorption from is produced as the gas cools through temperatures of @xmath61  k. if at this point the gas is falling back toward the smc , a shift toward higher velocities from the low - ionization gas would be expected , as is seen in the data .",
    "this scenario might also explain the correlation with star formation , if the expelled gas remains close to the site of star formation .",
    "this might not be expected in a rotating disk system like the milky way , but would be more likely in the smc , which appears to lack a coherent direction of rotation .",
    "@xcite found diffuse x - ray emission in the smc with spectral properties that favor an origin in hot gas , leading them to suggest a fountain model for the smc .",
    "the observations are consistent with this interpretation .",
    "this model is closely related to the supershell scenario discussed above , with the key difference being whether the hot gas is located in the main body of the smc or in the halo . @xcite and @xcite state that a burst of star formation in a dwarf galaxy will form a superbubble that will easily break out into the halo because the gravitational potential is small , so it is reasonable to expect a fountain to exist in a star - forming dwarf galaxy like the smc .",
    "using the model of @xcite for gas radiatively cooling from t  @xmath62  10@xmath63  k , it is possible to roughly estimate the mass flow rate implied by the column density .",
    "the expression for the mass flow rate _ m_/@xmath64 is @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the mean mass per atom , @xmath67 is the initial density of ionized hydrogen in the cooling gas , @xmath64 is the surface area of the fountain region , and @xmath68 is the flux if cooling gas in units of hydrogen ions @xmath69 .",
    "edgar & chevalier find that under isobaric conditions @xmath70()@xmath71 $ ] .",
    "using the mean column density in table 4 leads to a mass flow per unit surface area of @xmath72 we leave @xmath67 as an unknown , as there is no reliable way to estimate this for the smc .",
    "similarly , an estimate of the surface area of the smc is very difficult to make in light of the irregular morphology and unknown orientation of the galaxy .",
    "our estimate for the mass flow per unit area is probably similar to the number that would be derived for the milky way , since the column densities are similar ( to within a factor of 2 ) .",
    "a more detailed discussion of this type of calculation can be found in @xcite .",
    "if the is in front of both low ionization components , it is falling toward the smc .",
    "this might occur if the hot gas were stripped out of the smc by the gravitational interaction with the milky way , and is now falling back on the smc .",
    "@xcite found that the magellanic stream contains a high column of ( log @xmath5()@xmath73 ) , comparable to the columns seen in the smc .",
    "this would naturally explain the observed velocity shifts .",
    "it does not , however , explain the observed spatial correlation between high column density and star - forming regions .",
    "a clearer understanding of the origin of hot gas in the smc might be gained by comparing to other high ions , such as , , and .",
    "unfortunately , very little work has been done on these ions in the smc with @xmath74 , so most of the available information is from @xmath49 spectra .",
    "the low signal - to - noise of the @xmath49 spectra make the determination of accurate column densities difficult .",
    "table 5 lists the ratios of the column densities of high ions for the four @xmath0  stars with reliable @xmath49 measurements .",
    "of the four sight lines , the gas toward av235 appears to be in the highest ionization state .",
    "however , av229 and av232 are in a star - forming region where appreciable and may be produced locally .",
    "sk  188 is a wolf - rayet star , which might also lead to and production .",
    "thus , the limited @xmath49 data for and do not allow a discrimination between the possible origins of the highly ionized gas in the smc .    a stis spectrum of one smc sight line , av229 ( hd 5980 ) , has been analyzed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this sight line passes through an snr in the smc , but the snr absorption is well separated from the smc absorption .",
    "@xcite showed that the / and / ratios in the general ism along this sight line are in the range of the milky way halo ratios , implying that the processes producing the hot gas in the two galaxies are similar .",
    "the ratios in the snr absorption were found to agree well with those predicted for evolved supernova remnants , and were different from the general ism ratios in the smc , suggesting that not all of the hot gas is in the form of cooling snrs .",
    "av229 is a luminous blue variable / wolf - rayet binary star and is in a large region , so there may be local factors affecting the and abundance . the @xmath0  data toward sk  108 indicate that the / ratio is several times higher than the milky way halo , suggesting that the ratio varies widely in the smc @xcite .",
    "a systematic survey of high ion absorption in the smc with stis would be useful for studying the origin of highly ionized gas .",
    "in this paper we have described the properties of absorption along 18 sight lines in the small magellanic cloud , using far ultraviolet spectra obtained with @xmath0 .",
    "the main results are :    1 .   absorption from is seen along every sight line in the smc .",
    "the sight lines range in environment from star - forming regions ( @xmath32 , ngc  346 ) to the field ( @xmath32 , av423 ) , and includes the periphery of the smc ( sk  188 ) .",
    "the occurrence of absorption in every direction indicates the presence of a widespread component of coronal temperature gas in the smc .",
    "2 .   the average column density is log @xmath5 ( ) @xmath75 .",
    "this is about 1.7 times higher then the milky way average of the column density perpendicular to the plane of log @xmath5 ( ) @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "however , if ngc  346 is excluded , the average for the rest of the smc falls to @xmath77 , only 1.4 times higher than the galactic average .",
    "the column density is correlated with position in the smc .",
    "the highest values are seen toward the star - forming region ngc  346 , and to a lesser extent toward the star - forming regions in the southwestern end of the bar .",
    "lower values are seen in the central region and in the wing , where there is little star formation activity .",
    "this suggests that local processes strongly affect the hot gas distribution in the smc , particularly in ngc  346 .",
    "the line widths are broader than expected for pure thermal broadening , indicating that either non - thermal motions are prevalent , or that there are multiple components of hot gas at different velocities .",
    "the smc line widths are broader than the milky way lines .",
    "the kinematics suggest that the is not associated with the gas producing the bulk of the low ionization absorption at @xmath50  kms@xmath13 .",
    "the velocity is closer that of the @xmath51  kms@xmath13  low ionization component , but evidence for a physical association is not conclusive .",
    "we discuss several mechanisms that may explain the observations , with superbubbles and/or a galactic fountain being the most probable .",
    "if a galactic fountain is responsible for producing the hot gas , the rate of mass flow per unit surface area of the flow region is @xmath78 m@xmath12 yr@xmath13 kpc@xmath14 , assuming an initial gas density of 10@xmath14 cm@xmath14 , which is very uncertain .",
    "since the column density in the smc is within a factor of 2 of that of the milky way , the mass flow rates are probably similar if other conditions are the same .",
