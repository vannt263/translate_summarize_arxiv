    "the paper presents generalization of heston s ( 1993 ) @xcite stochastic volatility model based on time - dependent model parameters .",
    "the heston model is one of the most widely used stochastic volatility ( sv ) models today .",
    "the heston model can be viewed as a stochastic volatility generalization of the black and scholes ( 1973 ) @xcite model and includes it as a special case .",
    "it is well known that the implied volatility smile used with black - scholes formula tends to systematically misprice out - of - the - money and in - the - money options if the volatility implied from the at - the - money option has been used . according to this effect various sv option pricing models ( hull and white ( 1987 ) @xcite , stein and stein ( 1991 ) @xcite , heston ( 1993 ) @xcite )",
    "have been developed to capture the smile  effect .",
    "the popularity and the attractiveness of the heston model lies in the combination of its three main features : it does not allow negative volatility , it allows the correlation between asset returns and volatility and it has a closed - form pricing formula . however , to use heston model for option pricing one needs to know the model structural parameters .",
    "this brings us to the calibration problem and in the case of heston model it faces several difficulties .",
    "for example the data used for model calibration are observed at discrete times , but the model is built under a continuous - time framework .    within the calibration problem lies the need of generalization of the heston model . generally speaking ,",
    "because the prices from stochastic engines ( in our case the heston model ) are not supported by market prices , as a result the model parameters have to be recalibrated every day to new market data .",
    "this solution to calibration issue , apart from time consuming is not consistent with an accurate description of the dynamics .",
    "this is the main motivation to consider the heston model with time - dependent parameters .",
    "in this section the overview of the heston model will be presented .",
    "we will derive the pricing partial differential equation ( pde ) , which forms the basis of the derivation of the characteristic function in the next section .",
    "the heston model was first introduced in @xcite , where we have two stochastic differential equations , one for the underlying asset price @xmath0 and one for the variance @xmath1 of log@xmath2):@xmath3    here @xmath4 @xmath5 and @xmath6 stands for speed of mean reversion , the mean level of variance and the volatility of the volatility , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the brownian motions @xmath7 and @xmath8 are assumed to be correlated with correlation coefficient @xmath9 from the heston model definition given by eq.([heston ] ) , it is trivial observation that sde for the variance can be recognized as a mean - reverting square root process - cir process , a process originally proposed by cox , ingersoll & ross ( 1985 ) @xcite to model the spot interest rate . using ito s lemma and standard arbitrage arguments we arrive at garman s pricing pde for the heston model which reads    @xmath10 \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial v},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath11 is the market price of volatility risk . for the reader convenience a detail derivation",
    "is given in appendix a. we further simplify the pricing pde given by eq.([heston - pde ] ) by defining the forward option price @xmath12 in which@xmath13\\ ] ]    finally , define @xmath14 then we obtain the so - called forward equation in the form@xmath15 + \\label{heston - forwardpde } \\\\",

    "since @xmath28 , \\ ] ]    where @xmath29 is some risk - neutral measure , the problem for exact analytic solution for the heston model is cast to problem for the respective characteristic function or more precisely solutions for the @xmath30 and @xmath31 factors for the characteristic function .",
    "there are several directions towards generalizations of the heston model with time - dependent parameters . mikhailov and nogel ( 2003 ) @xcite",
    "indicate that @xmath32 can be relaxed from the constrain to be constant . as can be seen from eq.([a - b1 ] ) the parameter @xmath32 can be assumed time dependent and the exact solution of @xmath23 is still possible .",
    "mikhailov and nogel indicate that other choices of time dependent parameters are still possible but the general solution of the ode system eq.([a - b - ode ] ) is restricted from the riccati equation given in eq.([a - b2 ] ) .",
    "other possible generalizations are related to time discrimination - piece - wise constant parameters or asymptotic solutions .",
    "our approach assumes that all model parameters have linear time dependence .",
    "i.e. @xmath33 @xmath34 and @xmath35 are linear in respect in time .",
    "although this is a restrictive , we would like to note that locally , arbitrary time dependence is reduced to linear .",
    "also such generalization is the simplest non - trivial , where all model parameters are time - dependent .",
    "we should stress that our main concern is finding a solution of the eq.(a - b2 ) , because the solution of the @xmath23 is simply given by integration with integrand the desired solution of @xmath36 times @xmath37      we should stress that even within this framework , assuming linear time - dependence for all model parameters , the solution is complicated . with this reasoning ,",
    "we first will consider constant @xmath38 and linear @xmath33 @xmath32 and @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath39    having defined model parameters the next step is looking for solutions .",
    "because the analytic theory for second order linear ode  with time - dependent coefficients is well studied , our first step is to cast the riccati equation in eq.([a - b2 ] ) to linear second order ode . in eq.([a - b2 ] ) , after the substitution @xmath40    where @xmath41 , we obtain@xmath42    according to the substitution eq.([b - d - transform ] ) and the initial conditions eq.([initial conditions ] ) the new initial condition for @xmath43 reads    [ initail - d ] @xmath44    note that we should have two initial conditions as we intend to solve second order ode , but because the prime equation is eq.([a - b2 ] ) , which is first order , the initial condition in eq.([d2 ] ) is sufficient . with the notation",
    "used we obtain the following equation to solve    @xmath45    where @xmath46    eq.([d - confluent - hyper ] ) can be transformed to confluent hypergeometric equation via the substitution@xmath47    after simple algebra we obtain@xmath48    if we compare the equation given eq.([d - confluent - hyper - finall ] ) with the standard form of the confluent hypergeometric equation , which reads    @xmath49    we immediately can write the desired solution . basic reference formulas about confluent hypergeometric equation and its solutions are given in appendix c. the solution for eq.([d - confluent - hyper - finall ] ) is @xmath50 +   \\label{d - solution } \\\\ & & a_{2}u\\left [ \\frac{\\alpha \\gamma } { 2g_{1}},\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{(g_{1}\\tau + g_{2})^{2}}{2g_{1}}\\right ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath51 $ ] and @xmath52 $ ] are standard notations for the kummer functions @xcite representing the two linear independent solutions of eq.([conf - hypergeometric ] ) . from appendix c , because @xmath53 second solution @xmath54 of eq.([conf - hypergeometric ] ) is given by convergent series for all values if @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "next step towards completing the solution for the time - dependent heston model is to obtain the integration constants @xmath57 and @xmath58 from the initial condition .    using eq.([dz - m ] ) and eq.([dz - u ] )",

    "the heston model is among the most popular stochastic volatility models due to its analytical tractability . nevertheless , the complete use of the heston model is still challenging because it has a closed formula only when the parameters are constant or piecewise constant or within the asymptotic limits .",
    "the aim of this research is to fill this theoretical gap and to enrich the usability of this very popular model in respect to calibration issues .",
    "there are several concluding remarks that should be also noted :    a similar to the presented above approach is applicable to the svj models and more precisely to the bates model .",
    "this problem will be addressed in more details in forthcoming research .    within the presented work we have assumed that all model parameters obey linear time dependence .",
