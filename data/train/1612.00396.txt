    "a model - based study of clinical isolates from pailin ( western cambodia ) by saralamba  _ et al . _ in 2011 demonstrated that artemisinin - resistant parasites displayed a reduced sensitivity to artesunate ( an artemisinin derivative with active metabolite dihydroartemisinin ) during the ring - stage of infection @xcite .",

    "building from early models , which treated infected red blood cells as a single compartment @xcite , models have expanded to capture the different stages of the parasite life cycle in the red blood cell ( ring , trophozoite , schizont ) allowing the incorporation of stage - dependent drug effects @xcite .",
    "a feature common to all pk  pd models of artemisinin - based therapy developed to date has been the _ implicit assumption _ that the relationship between drug concentration and the rate of parasite killing is independent of the history of exposure . the transient killing rate @xmath1 ( i.e.  the fraction of parasites killed by drug per unit time ) has been empirically modelled by a hill function of plasma drug concentration ( @xmath2 ) , @xmath3 where parameters @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are ( possibly stage - dependent ) fixed quantities ( i.e.  constants ) @xcite . the killing rate varies with drug concentration in a sigmoidal manner and saturates at the maximum killing rate @xmath4 for high drug concentration .",

    "@xcite have provided clear evidence that a higher drug concentration may not result in an increased killing effect and indeed may be less effective if the exposure time is shortened .",
    "they demonstrated that the fraction of parasites that remains viable ( i.e.  able to asexually reproduce and so initiate a subsequent round of blood - stage infection ) does not depend solely on the applied drug concentration .",
    "rather , viability was established to be a complex function of the _ cumulative _ drug exposure and the initial drug concentration , manifesting as ( stage - dependent ) variations in the exposure time required to render parasites non - viable @xcite . the minimum exposure time required for loss of viability",

    "viability data published in @xcite but also identify the relative contributions of drug concentration and stress response in determining the effective killing effect .    specifically , the estimate for @xmath28 , which determines the strength of the delay , shows that mid - ring stage 3d7 parasites exhibit a substantially more delayed response to dha exposure than do other stages .",
    "this is consistent with the original analyses presented in klonis _",
    "@xcite , where a semi - mechanistic ( but not dynamic ) cumulative effective dose ( ced ) model was used for interpretation of stage - specific drug effects .",
    "et al . _ also reported an unexpected finding that early - ring parasites exhibited a hypersensitivity to dha compared to mid - ring parasites .",
    "our model results ( fig .",
    "[ fig : params ] ) show that a rapid induction of maximal killing ( i.e.  a rapid increase in @xmath25 ) , rather than a large increase in the magnitude of the maximum killing rate itself , is the primary explanation for this hypersensitivity .",
    "we also examined through simulation of the full pk ",
    "pd model how a cumulative drug response affects _ in vivo _ parasite dynamics .",
    "we considered the standard as7 artesunate treatment regimen ( a dose of artesunate every 24 hours for 7 days ) .",
    "parasites that are more able to withstand exposure ( i.e.  that have a lower @xmath28 ) during the mid - ring stage remain in circulation for a significantly greater period of time , with pd profiles that reflect those from patients infected with resistant strains .",
    "these results agree with those we have previously presented using the ced - model ( figure 7 in @xcite ) , but we emphasise that the results presented here ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pkpd - full ] ) arise from a fully mechanistic pk  pd model .",
    "this is an important distinction as , by construction , our pk ",
    "pd model accounts for the ageing and natural replication dynamics of the parasite population , the time - varying nature of the drug - concentration , and the interaction ( killing ) between parasite and drug in a self - consistent and biologically realistic way .",
    "this provides us with enhanced predictive power when compared to the ced - model , which while empirically useful , was not well - suited to _ in vivo _ simulation .",
    "we emphasise that our _ in vivo _",
    "simulations provide predictions of the number of viable parasites .",
    "however , _ in vivo _ assays can not distinguish between viable and non - viable parasites , nor detect sequestered parasites .",
    "as such , further advances in experimental assays are required to fully test the predictions from these simulations .",
    "we have referred to the modulatory variable , @xmath25 , throughout the paper as a `` stress '' .",
    "we have done so to provide guidance as to possible biological interpretations of @xmath25 , but for now an incomplete understanding of the mechanism of action of the artemisinins limits the degree to which our phenomenologically - based model can be correlated with specific biological stresses induced by exposure to artemisinins .",
    "recent work @xcite confirms earlier studies @xcite suggesting that artemisinins exert their activity by alkylating multiple targets within the parasite .",
    "reports of growth retardation , quiescence and dormancy following artemisinin exposure @xcite are reminiscent of the cytostatic stress response observed in other organisms @xcite .",
    "further developments in understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of artemisinin activity are required to further refine our model for `` stress '' .",
    "the details of any of these processes , were they to be confirmed to be associated with cumulative drug effects , would be able to be incorporated into our model in a straightforward manner through adjustment of the equations governing the time - evolution of @xmath4 and @xmath6 .",
    "an immediate implication of our model concerns the possible mechanism by which the malaria parasite attains resistance to artemisinin .",
    "drug - resistance is typically characterised by an increase in the drug concentration required ( _ in vitro _ or _ in vivo _ ) to achieve maximal ( or half maximal ) killing .",
    "however , our exploratory analysis suggests that increasing tolerance to stress ( i.e.  reducing @xmath28 ) can also underpin drug escape .",
    "indeed , the experimental results from @xcite in which resistance may be overcome through application of proteasome inhibitors such as carfilzomib support this possibility . furthermore ,",
    "if such a mechanism where at play , then long - lived drugs acting on the same ( or a similar ) pathway , and subject to the same `` resistance '' mutations would not result in a resistant - phenotype when applied for extended periods ( as @xmath25 would still saturate and a high rate of killing would be achieved ) .",
    "this is precisely the behaviour observed for oz439 ( half - life over 10  hours ) in recent experiments @xcite .",
    "the model we have introduced , while overcoming restrictions of the standard pk  pd approach and successfully capturing the complex dynamics observed in @xcite for the 3d7 strain , has a number of limitations .",
    "most importantly , eq .  [ eq : m1a ] assumes a drug concentration - independent increase in @xmath25 while @xmath84 and then an instantaneous return to zero when the drug concentration drops below @xmath26 .",
    "however , this simple approach to modelling the stress , @xmath25 , reflects the current limitations on our understanding of the mechanism of action of the artemisinins . with further data on how the drugs act",
    ", the dynamics of stress in the model can be adjusted to reflect the improved understanding .",
    "one important avenue to pursue is to examine how parasites that survive exposure to an initial drug pulse respond to a subsequent drug pulse . does their `` stress '' ( @xmath25 )",
    "return to zero , or do they display some memory of previous exposure , and so presumably succumb more quickly upon subsequent exposure ? if such recovery exists , what is the typical time - scale in relation to the life - cycle ?",
    "such possibilities are 1 ) able to be probed experimentally using the techniques of @xcite ; and 2 ) able to be readily incorporated into more complex models of the form introduced in this paper .",
    "another area for improvement in the approach taken here is in translating from the _ in vitro _ to _ in vivo _ situation .",
    "for example , our simple simulations assume there is no killing of parasites due to immune response mechanisms triggered within the host .",
    "while the immune response is unlikely to play a major role during the early stages of infection , as infection progresses its effects would be anticipated to become more significant .",
    "therefore , given the fact that both the drug effect and immune response are dynamic in nature , it will be important to explore how differences in the timing of drug application and activation of various immune mechanisms impact upon parasite clearance and optimisation of drug regimens . in the meantime ,",
    "our results provide new insight into how _",
    "p. falciparum _ responds to drug .",
    "our model provides an enhanced predictive platform for evaluating the likely efficacy of alternative artemisinin - based drug regimens , directly contributing to the efforts to maintain effective control of malaria .",
