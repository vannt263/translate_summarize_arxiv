    "the empirical relationship between the stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath0 ) of the spheroidal component of galaxies and the mass of the super - massive black hole ( @xmath9 ) at their center ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has been extensively used to estimate @xmath9 in active and inactive galaxies .",
    "more direct determinations of @xmath9 , through stellar kinematics within the black hole s sphere of influence , or broad emission line measurements , are only feasible for a limited number of objects , making the @xmath10 relation a very useful alternative .",
    "cosmological simulations suggest that the central super - massive black hole ( smbh ) evolves together with the host galaxy and plays a fundamental role in its evolution @xcite , and this co - evolution may be the mechanism that leads to the @xmath10 relation .",
    "the intrinsic scatter in the relation ( i.e. , the range of @xmath9 found for a given @xmath0 ) therefore contains information about the processes of galaxy and black hole evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "besides the @xmath10 relation , stellar velocity dispersion measurements are also relevant for many other astrophysical applications , including the galaxy fundamental plane ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the metallicity-@xmath0 relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the @xmath11 ratio that is an important criterium to determine the dynamical state of early type galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , etc . for all of these reasons ,",
    "understanding the factors affecting @xmath0 measurements is an important issue .",
    "measurements of @xmath0 in galaxies have traditionally been done at wavelengths @xmath121 @xmath1 m , often using the `` mg b '' line at 0.52 @xmath1 m , or the 0.85 @xmath1 m calcium triplet absorption ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "measurements based on stellar absorption lines in the infrared ( ir ) , on the other hand , can also probe regions that are obscured by dust at optical wavelengths , or different stellar populations from those revealed in the optical . for these reasons ,",
    "several recent studies have compared @xmath0 values obtained from the fitting of stellar absorptions in the optical and in the near - ir spectral regions , generally using the co absorption band heads in the h and k bands @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented stellar velocity dispersions measured from the 2.29@xmath1 m co band head in a sample composed of 18 lenticular ( s0 ) and 7 elliptical galaxies .",
    "the resulting sigma values were compared with literature values derived primarily from fitting the ca ii lines near 4000 a , the mgb lines near 5175 a , and the 8500",
    "ca ii triplet ( hereafter cat ) .",
    "the @xmath4 values were found to be up to 30% smaller than @xmath8 , with a median difference of 11% . however , this difference was observed only in the lenticular galaxies ; in the elliptical galaxies , the optical and ir measurements were consistent .",
    "the authors speculate that the difference may be related to the presence and distribution of dust in the s0 objects : if the dust is mainly located in the stellar disk , optical @xmath0 measurements will be biased towards the less - obscured , dynamically hotter bulge component .",
    "@xmath1 m .",
    "@xcite measured @xmath4 in a sample of 19 fornax cluster members , composed of roughly equal numbers of elliptical and lenticular galaxies .",
    "these measurements were compared with @xmath8 from @xcite and found to be consistent , with @xmath13 .",
    "the lack of a discernible difference between @xmath4 and @xmath8 in the lenticular galaxies does not agree with the findings of @xcite .",
    "it is , however , consistent with a previous study of velocity dispersions in the fornax cluster by @xcite .",
    "optical and ir velocity dispersions were also compared by @xcite .",
    "this work used the co absorption bands around 1.6  @xmath1 m , rather than those near 2.3  @xmath1 m , to derive @xmath4 for 31 galaxies : 19 elliptical , 9 lenticular , and 3 spiral .",
    "no significant difference was found between @xmath4 and @xmath8 ( based mainly on the cat ) .",
    "this suggests that both sets of lines probe roughly the same stars , and provides no evidence for a dynamically cold , obscured population .",
    "@xcite also compared @xmath4 and @xmath5 for a set of galaxies .",
    "this time , however , they studied 14 galaxy mergers , accompanied by a control sample of 23 elliptical galaxies .",
    "the measurements for the control sample were taken mostly from the literature , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 were found to be similar , in agreement with the studies above . on the other hand , large differences are found for the mergers .",
    "in particular , for luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs , 6 objects in their sample ) the @xmath0 derived in the optical is up to twice the value obtained for the near - ir . for the remaining 8 non - lirg mergers ,",
    "@xmath5 is slightly larger than @xmath4 .",
    "even larger discrepancies have been found for single nucleus ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , for which @xmath5 can be three times larger than @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the discrepancies arise because @xmath4 , although conveniently insensitive to dust absorption , probes a luminous , young stellar disk , whereas @xmath5 gives information about an older stellar population that is more representative of the galaxy s overall dynamical mass .",
    "co - based @xmath0 measurements imply that ulirgs can not be the progenitors of giant elliptical galaxies , whereas cat - based values are consistent with a range of final galaxy masses .",
    "the above studies have compared optical and co - based @xmath0 measurements for early - type ( e and s0 ) galaxies , and for galaxy mergers and ulirgs .",
    "little information is available , though , for late - type ( spiral ) objects , so the range of morphological types in which the large differences between @xmath4 and @xmath5 occur is not yet known .",
    "we aim to rectify this situation by measuring @xmath4 and @xmath5 in a sample of 48 nearby galaxies : 35 spirals , 7 lenticulars , and 6 ellipticals .",
    "we do this using slit spectroscopy covering simultaneously the cat and 2.29 @xmath1 m co spectral regions .",
    "in section  2 , we describe the sample and the observational data , and in section  3 we discuss the methods used to measure the stellar dispersion in the optical and in the near - ir .",
    "the results are presented in section  4 , while their implications are discussed in section  5 .",
    "the conclusions of the present paper are given in section  6 .",
    "the sample of galaxies used in this work comprises 48 objects selected from the palomar spectroscopic survey of nearby galaxies @xcite , covering a wide range of luminosity and nuclear activity type .",
    "some properties of the sample are shown in table  [ table ] , while full details of the overall program , sample , observations and data reduction are given in mason et al .",
    "( submitted ) .",
    "briefly , the spectroscopic data were obtained in queue mode  with the gemini near - infrared spectrograph ( gnirs ) on the gemini north telescope .",
    "the cross - dispersed mode was used with the 32 l / mm grating , providing simultaneous spectral coverage from approximately 0.85 to 2.5  @xmath1 m .",
    "we used the @xmath14 slit , generally oriented along the mean parallactic angle at the time of the observations to minimize differential refraction effects .",
    "the data were obtained between october 2011 and may 2013 . due",
    "to work done to address an issue with the 32 l / mm grating mount in 2012 , the spectral resolution of the spectra obtained with the 03 slit after november 2012 differs from that achieved previously .",
    "the spectral resolution before november 2012 is 11.6    and 4.4     for the k - band co band heads and the cat regions , respectively , obtained from the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the arc lamp calibration spectra .",
    "these values correspond to a resolution in velocity dispersion of @xmath1565  for both regions . after november 2012 , the resulting spectral resolutions are 18.2    and 7.4   corresponding to @xmath15100  and @xmath15110 .",
    "the data were reduced using standard procedures . to summarize ,",
    "the raw frames are first cleaned of any electronic striping and cosmic ray - like features arising from @xmath16 particles in the camera lens coatings .",
    "the files are divided by a flat field and sky - subtracted using blank sky exposures made between the on - source observations , then rectified using pinhole images .",
    "wavelength calibration is achieved using argon arc spectra , then a spectrum of each order is extracted , divided by a standard star to cancel telluric absorption lines , and roughly flux - calibrated using the telluric standard star spectrum .",
    "the individual orders are then combined to produce the final spectrum .",
    "the extraction aperture used for this work was 18 along the 03 slit , corresponding to a few tens to a few hundreds of parsecs at the distances of these galaxies .",
    "in order to obtain the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) we have used the penalized pixel - fitting ( ppxf ) method of @xcite to fit the co absorption band heads around 2.3  @xmath1 m in the k - band and the caii@xmath178500,8544,8665 ( the cat ) stellar absorptions in the z band .",
    "the best fit of the galaxy spectrum is obtained by convolving template stellar spectra with the corresponding losvd , assumed to be well represented by gauss - hermite series .",
    "the ppxf method outputs the radial velocity , velocity dispersion ( @xmath0 ) and higher order gauss - hermite moments ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) , as well as the uncertainties for each parameter .",
    "the @xmath18 and @xmath19 moments measure deviations of the line of sight velocity distribution from a gaussian curve : the parameter @xmath18 measures asymmetric deviations ( e.g. wings ) and the @xmath19 quantifies the peakiness of the profile , with @xmath20 and @xmath21 indicating narrower and broader profiles than gaussian , respectively @xcite .",
    "the dominant source of error in the velocity dispersion is usually related to the choice of stellar template used to fit the galaxy spectrum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this can be minimized by using a large stellar template library , instead of the spectrum of a single star .",
    "the ppxf allows the use of several stellar template spectra , and varies the weighting of each one to obtain the best match to the observed spectrum , minimizing issues arising from template mismatches .",
    "the set of templates must include stars that closely match the fitted galaxy spectrum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "for the fitting of the co absorptions , we used as template spectra those of the gemini near - ir late - type stellar library @xcite , which contains spectra of 60 stars with spectral types ranging from f7 iii to m5 iii , observed in the k band at a spectral resolution of @xmath153.2    ( fwhm ) .",
    "as template spectra for the cat region , we used selected spectra of stars from the cat stellar library of @xcite with a spectral resolution of 1.5    ( fwhm ) .",
    "this library contains spectra of 706 stars with all spectral types and is part of the medium - resolution isaac newton telescope library ( miles ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this work , we used only the spectra of stars with s / n ratio larger than 50 in the cat region in order to avoid the selection of noisy spectra by the ppxf code .",
    "the final template library contains 190 spectra , including several spectral types .",
    "we also tested the nasa infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) stellar spectral library @xcite that presents spectra of late - type stars ranging from 0.8 to 5.5  @xmath1 m at a spectral resolving power of @xmath22 , similar to the spectral resolution used in this work .",
    "the comparison of the kinematic parameters obtained with the irtf spectral library are similar to the ones obtained with the two libraries mentioned above . however , the standard deviation of the residuals ( defined as the difference between the galaxy spectrum and the best fit model ) and the uncertainties are much larger using the irtf library . this may be related to the s / n ratio of the irtf spectra , and/or their lower spectral resolution compared to the miles library .",
    "we therefore decided to use the gemini and miles libraries for this work .",
    "since the spectral resolution of the template stellar spectra for both spectral regions is better than the resolution of our observations , we degraded the stellar templates to the same resolution as the spectra of the galaxies before running the ppxf to measure the losvd . in order to properly fit the continuum emission we allowed ppxf to fit multiplicative legendre polynomials of order 1 to account for any slope introduced by dust / agn emission .",
    "since the order of the polynomials included is small , they do not introduce any bias in the derived stellar kinematics .",
    "although ppxf outputs the errors of the measurements , we also performed 100 iteration of monte carlo simulations where random noise was introduced to the galaxy spectrum , keeping constant the signal - to - noise ratio and the standard deviation of the 100 measurements for each galaxy .",
    "the errors obtained from the simulations are similar to the uncertainties that ppxf outputs .",
    "figure  [ fits - co ] shows the fits of the galaxy spectra at the region of the co band heads ( 2.252.41  @xmath1 m ) for all the galaxies of our sample .",
    "the fits reproduce the observed spectra very well for all objects , with the residuals being smaller than 3 times the standard deviation of the continuum emission next to the co absorptions .",
    "two objects ( ngc  2273 and ngc  4388 ) present strong [ caviii ] 2.322 @xmath1 m line emission superimposed on the second @xmath23co absorption band head , so this band was excluded from the fitted region .",
    "the fits for the cat spectral region ( 84808730   ) are shown in figure  [ fits - ca ] .",
    "they also reproduce the observed spectra well , with the residuals again generally being smaller than 3 times the standard deviation of the continuum emission next to the cat .",
    "however , for some objects the residuals are somewhat larger ( e.g. ngc5194 , ngc5371 , ngc7743 , and ngc7332  see bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fits - ca ] ) due to the lower s / n ratio of those spectra in this region .",
    "this results in uncertainties of up to 25  in the resulting velocity dispersions .    for the co spectral region , we find that @xmath2 is smaller than the spectral resolution of the spectra for 3 objects ( ngc205 , ngc404 and ngc5194 ) , while for the cat region only the dwarf elliptical ngc205 has @xmath0 smaller than the resolution .",
    "these values are marked by @xmath24 in table  [ table ] and should be considered highly uncertain . in particular , for the galaxies ngc205 and ngc404 , @xcite measured values lower than our resolution , using higher - resolution data .",
    "the major difference and main advantage of the present work , compared to previous studies , is that we measure both @xmath2 and @xmath3 from the same spectra , observed in the same way , with the same aperture and using the same method , while previous studies used their own @xmath2 measurements and compared them with optical @xmath0 values from the literature .",
    "resulting measurements of the stellar velocity dispersion and gauss - hermite moments for our sample are shown in table  [ table ] .",

    "as discussed in sec .  [ met ] , we were very careful in the estimation of the instrumental broadening , taking into account the facts that ( i ) our observations present distinct spectral resolutions depending on the date of the observations , and ( ii ) the spectral resolution for observations performed after november 2012 differs between the cat and co regions (  [ obsdr ] ) . the uncertainty ( rms ) in the fwhm of the arc lamp lines is smaller than 10  for both spectral regions and in order to  correct \" the offset from the one - to - one relation observed in @xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ sigma ] the fwhm in the cat region would have to be underestimated by more than 30  .",

    "usually fewer than 10 template spectra are needed by ppxf to successfully reproduce the co absorption band heads and the cat .",
    "although the libraries used here are large and contain spectra of stars with several spectral types , the fits to both spectral regions are dominated by giant and super - giant stars , with a slightly larger contribution from super - giants in the k band . these are the spectral types that are expected to dominate the emission in the near - ir , suggesting that ppxf is selecting the appropriate stars with which to fit the spectra . for most galaxies",
    "m - stars are the dominant contributor to the fits in the k - band , while k - stars dominate in the region of the cat .",
    "the difference between the intrinsic widths of the absorption lines in these stars is @xmath44 , which is negligible compared to the overall difference between @xmath5 and @xmath4 in the sample . in appendix [ appendix ] we show the stellar templates used to fit the spectrum of each galaxy .",
    "additionally , there is no difference in the @xmath45 values of the fits between early and late - type galaxies , suggesting that there is no bias in the choice of template for each type of galaxy .",
    "as several galaxies of our sample have a seyfert nucleus , hot dust emission may play an important role in the k - band continuum .",
    "the co band - heads can be  diluted \" by this emission , which might introduce an uncertainty in the measurements of @xmath4 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "to test whether the ppxf accounts correctly for variations of the continuum shape , we have simulated contributions of planck functions with temperatures ranging from 700 to 2000  k to the continuum emission at the k - band .",
    "no significant difference in @xmath4 was found when including dust emission ranging from 1% to 70% of the total k - band emission .",
    "furthermore , for the objects in which we could measure the @xmath0 from the h - band co lines ( where the contribution from agn - heated dust is smaller ; * ? ? ?",

    "thus , we conclude that the hot dust emission plays a negligible role in the @xmath0 measurements .    in galaxies with low values of @xmath0 , the fitting of higher order gauss - hermite moments can introduce uncertainties in the @xmath0 measurements ( see the _ bias _ parameter of the ppxf program ; * ? ? ?",

    "differences between the measurements may be due to the larger aperture ( 2@xmath46 4 ) used by @xcite , as well as differences in the s / n ratio of the spectra and the exact measurement procedures used .     with those found by @xcite using various optical lines .",
    "]    we therefore conclude that our @xmath0 measurements are robust , and that the observed difference between @xmath5 and @xmath4 is not due to measurement error .",
    "we have found a systematic offset between @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the galaxies in our sample , which are primarily spirals . in order to further investigate the @xmath0-discrepancy in late - type galaxies and compare the results with the available studies of other galaxy types , we compiled values for the @xmath4 and for optical measurements ( most of them obtained from the cat region ) from the literature for distinct classes of objects .",

    "indeed , near - ir studies of nearby galaxies show that the reddening obtained from near - ir lines is larger than that obtained from optical lines , indicating that the near - ir samples an obscuring column larger than the optical spectral region ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "assuming a standard galactic extinction curve @xcite , the extinction at 0.85 @xmath1 m ( cat ) is about a factor of 5 larger than that at 2.3 @xmath1 m ( co ) , and the extinction at 0.52 @xmath1 m ( mgb ) is about a factor of 2 greater again .",

    "however , @xcite compared @xmath3 and @xmath66 and did not find any systematic difference between them .",
    "secondly , warm ( @xmath67  k ) , fir - emitting dust may be associated with star formation in these galaxies .",
    "indeed , the emission of the warm dust is directly correlated with the star formation rate , as it is heated by young stars @xcite .",
    "young stars form in disks , and in the absence of major perturbations generally remain dynamically cold .",
    "indications of young stars in disks have been found in recent spatially resolved spectroscopy of galaxy nuclei with the near - ir ifu spectrograph ( nifs ) on gemini north .",
    "@xcite and @xcite carried out stellar population synthesis and found a spatial relation between low @xmath4 and the young / intermediate age stellar population , confirming that @xmath4 is affected by the presence of young / intermediate age stars .",
    "the presence of a young stellar population has also been proposed as an explanation of the @xmath0-drop observed in some galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the comparison of our results with spatially resolved measurements should be taken with caution . while the nifs data resolve a dynamically cold structure , our single - aperture measurements probe the second moment of the losvd , which does not necessarily imply a direct link between the two sets of results .",
    "new spatially resolved measurements of both the cat and co lines would show whether the effect we are observing here is related to the low-@xmath0 regions observed in the works cited above .",
    "if the difference between @xmath2 and @xmath3 is due to the presence of a young stellar population in the disk of the galaxies , young stars must contribute more to the co absorption features than do older stars , and the effect of this population on the @xmath0 measured from the cat and optical lines must be negligible . the connection between the co and cat bands and the age of the stellar population is not straightforward , though .",
    "for example , the co bands are relatively strong in both young / intermediate - age stars ( agb / tp - agb stars ) and old ones ( m stars ) , while hotter , younger stars produce strong cat bands along with weak co features ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we can use the measured @xmath0 values to evaluate the impact of the @xmath0 discrepancy on determinations of the mass of the central smbh using the @xmath10 relationship .",

    "@xcite investigated the @xmath10 relation using a sample of 93 late - type galaxies with a seyfert 1 nucleus .",
    "they found no difference in the slope for subsamples of barred and unbarred galaxies , but they found a small offset in the relation between low- and high - inclination disk galaxies , with the latter having a larger @xmath0 value for a given black hole mass . for a review of calibrations of the @xmath10 relation ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "actually , @xcite show that the physically relevant parameter in black hole correlations with host galaxy type is not early - type vs. late - type objects , but rather classical bulges versus pseudo bulges .",
    "the latter is defined as the buildup of dense central components that look like classical merger - built bulges but that were in fact formed slowly by disks out of disk material @xcite .",
    "since the aim of the present paper is to evaluate the impact of the use of co - based measurements of the stellar velocity dispersion on the derived mass of the super - massive black hole , and not to calibrate the @xmath10 relationship , we use the same calibration for all objects of our sample , given by @xcite as :    @xmath71    we estimated the mass of the smbh for all spiral galaxies of our sample using @xmath5 and @xmath4 in the equation above .",
    "the mean logarithmic difference is @xmath72 , which may be taken as a systematic error in the @xmath10 relation when using co - based estimates of the stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "we have used 0.85  2.5  @xmath1 m spectroscopy of a sample of 48 galaxies ( 35 spirals , 7 lenticulars and 6 ellipticals ) obtained with the gemini near - infrared spectrograph ( gnirs ) on gemini north telescope to measure the stellar kinematics by fitting the k - band co absorption band heads and the cat at 8550   .",
    "this work is aimed at determining whether the difference in @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( the `` @xmath7 discrepancy '' ) reported for ulirgs and merger remnants persists in the hitherto unexplored regime of late - type galaxies .",
    "our main conclusions are :    * the velocity dispersion obtained from the 2.29 @xmath1 m co band - heads is slightly smaller than the one from fitting the cat , with an average difference of @xmath73   for the complete sample ( all morphological types ) .",
    "* we compiled the available @xmath0 values from literature and found an almost one - to - one relation between optical ( cat , mgb , etc . ) and co - based estimates for early - type galaxies . for spiral galaxies",
    "the discrepancy is higher , but still much lower than for merger remnants .",
    "the best fit for spiral galaxies is @xmath6 , but more observations covering the @xmath0 ranges @xmath74  and @xmath75  are needed to properly calibrate this relation .",
    "* the fractional @xmath0 difference correlates with the infrared luminosity , which may suggest that the @xmath0-discrepancy is related to the presence of warm dust . in this scenario , the co absorption band heads would be dominated by young stars located in the disc of the galaxy and thus result in smaller @xmath0 values , while the optical estimates are less sensitive to variations in the stellar population .",
    "however , the detailed spectral synthesis that would be needed to test this interpretation requires high spectral resolution ssp models , which are not yet available . * we investigated the impact of the @xmath7discrepancy on the mass of the smbh obtained via the @xmath76 relation and found a mean logarithmic difference of @xmath72 , that must be considered as a systematic error in the smbh mass when using @xmath4 for spiral galaxies .",
    "however , this uncertainty is dominated by scatter of the relation and the conversion from @xmath4 to @xmath8 may introduce a even larger uncertainty in the derived @xmath77 .",

    "<S> we examine the stellar velocity dispersions ( @xmath0 ) of a sample of 48 galaxies , 35 of which are spirals , from the palomar nearby galaxy survey . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that for ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) and merger remnants the @xmath0 derived from the near - infrared co band - heads is smaller than that measured from optical lines , while no discrepancy between these measurements is found for early - type galaxies . </S>",

    "<S> we used cross - dispersed spectroscopic data obtained with the gemini near - infrared spectrograph ( gnirs ) , with spectral coverage from 0.85 to 2.5  @xmath1 m , to obtain @xmath0 measurements from the 2.29 @xmath1 m co band - heads ( @xmath2 ) , and the 0.85 @xmath1 m calcium triplet ( @xmath3 ) . for the spiral galaxies in the sample </S>",
    "<S> , we found that @xmath4 is smaller than @xmath5 , with a mean fractional difference of 14.3% . </S>",
    "<S> the best fit to the data is given by @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this `` @xmath0 discrepancy '' may be related to the presence of warm dust , as suggested by a slight correlation between the discrepancy and the infrared luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with studies that have found no @xmath7discrepancy in dust - poor early - type galaxies , and a much larger discrepancy in dusty merger remnants and ulirgs . that @xmath4 is lower than @xmath8 may also indicate the presence of a dynamically cold stellar population component </S>",
