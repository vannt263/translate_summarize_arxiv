    "the recent results on cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy from the wmap satellite @xcite represent an extraordinary success for the standard cosmological model of structure formation based on cold dark matter ( cdm ) and adiabatic primordial perturbations .",
    "furthermore , data releases from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; ) are living up to expectations and combined analysis of all these datasets are placing strong constraints on most cosmological parameters .",
    "however , even if theory and observations are in spectacular agreement , discrepancies seem to be present and have already stimulated the interest of several authors .",
    "one of most unexpected results from the first year wmap data is indeed the detection of an excess in the large angular scale cross temperature - polarization power spectrum @xcite . in the standard scenario ,",
    "this excess may be interpreted as due to a late reionization process which produces a second last scattering surface at lower redshifts ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the cmb radiation can therefore get polarized through anisotropic thomson scattering on angular scales comparable to the horizon at reionization ( @xmath4 )",
    ".    analysis made by the wmap team of the cross temperature - polarization data constrains the best - fit value of the thomson optical depth of the universe to @xmath0 ( the exact best - fit value and the errors depend on the analysis technique employed ) . following this",
    ", considerable effort is spent in constructing models , both numerical @xcite and semi - analytical @xcite , analyzing the feasibility of such a high @xmath5 . in this context",
    ", it was shown that an early population of metal - free stars , with reasonably low values of star - forming efficiency and escape fraction @xcite , is sufficient to produce such a high @xmath5 .    in this paper",
    "we want to emphasize another aspect of this result and investigate the compatibility of cosmological and astrophysical data with a very extended reionization process i.e. @xmath6 .",
    "as we illustrate in the next section , the parameter extraction made by the wmap team has not considered this case , since a top - hat prior of @xmath7 has been included in their analyses ( see and ) .",
    "given the fact that the reionization process is still to be fully understood , one could wonder about the robustness of this assumption . in the next section",
    "we will indeed show that @xmath8 is compatible with the data and , as already pointed out in @xcite , letting @xmath5 to vary freely up to @xmath9 more than doubles the error bars on cosmological parameters . studying the astrophysical feasibility of a very extended reionization is therefore not only important for the theoretical understanding of the process but also for determining the cosmological parameters with highest possible accuracy and reliability .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we analyze current cmb and large scale structure data to show that high values of the optical depth are not excluded and discuss the implications of having @xmath2 on cosmological parameters . in section 3 , we verify whether models with @xmath2 violate any observational constraints related to the ionization and thermal history of the universe .",
    "the final section presents our conclusions .",
    "in this section we investigate the possibility of having a high optical depth @xmath2 by analyzing current cmb and large scale structure data .",
    "the method we adopt is based on the markov chain monte carlo package ` cosmomc ` @xcite .",
    "we use individual chains and we adopt the raftery and lewis convergence diagnostics we sample the following 6 dimensional set of cosmological parameters , adopting flat priors on them : the physical baryon and cdm densities , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the ratio of the sound horizon to the angular diameter distance at decoupling , @xmath12 , the scalar spectral index and the overall normalization of the spectrum , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and , finally , the optical depth to reionization , @xmath5 . furthermore , we consider purely adiabatic initial conditions , we impose flatness and we do not include gravitational waves .",
    "relaxing flatness does not affect @xmath5 in a very significant way ; however , it does alter the values of the other basic parameters and thus , may further change the interpretation and astrophysical implications of the overall results .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the case of 3 massless neutrino families .",
    "we include the first - year temperature and polarization data @xcite with the routine for computing the likelihood supplied by the wmap team @xcite as well as the cbi @xcite and acbar measurements of the cmb .",
    "in addition to the cmb data , we also consider the constraints on the real - space power spectrum of galaxies from the sdss @xcite .",
    "we restrict the analysis to a range of scales over which the fluctuations are assumed to be in the linear regime ( @xmath15 ) . when combining the matter power spectrum with cmb data , we marginalize over a bias @xmath16 , constant with scale and redshift , considered as an additional nuisance parameter .",
    "the results of our analysis are reported in table 1 and displayed in figures 14 . in figure 1",
    "we show the likelihood distribution function obtained by analyzing the wmap data only . as we can see",
    "the data does not provide strong constraints on @xmath5 and values as large as @xmath17 are compatible with the data . as a further example , we plot in figure 2 the @xmath18 likelihood distribution on the @xmath19-@xmath5 plane after marginalization over the remaining _ nuisance _ parameters .",
    "as we can see there is a clear degeneracy between the two parameters and the value of the hubble constant is not constrained by the wmap data alone .",
    "the claimed constraint in of @xmath20 at @xmath21 c.l . is mostly due to the top prior on @xmath5 . for comparison",
    ", we report in table 1 the results from a similar analysis but with now the inclusion of an external top - hat prior of @xmath7 as in the analysis made by the wmap team @xcite .",
    "as we can see , the inclusion of the optical depth prior more than halves the error bars and greatly improves the constraints on the hubble parameter , the spectral index and the baryon density to values in agreement with those reported by the wmap team .",
    "it is useful to compare the wmap constraints derived in the case of @xmath22 with independent cosmological probes .",
    "if we assume a high value of @xmath23 , then the likelihood best fit values are @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "a value of @xmath27 is still in reasonable agreement with the hst constraint of @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "values of @xmath29 are difficult to reconcile with abundances of primordial light elements and standard big bang nucleosynthesis which provide @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "however , neutrino physics is still rather unknown and deviations from the standard model , like inclusion of neutrino chemical potential or extra relativistic degrees of freedom could be present and larger values of @xmath31 may be possible ( see e.g. ) .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the high @xmath5 case is in agreement with the wmap data and that the best fit cosmological model with @xmath8 is in reasonable agreement with several other observables .       including the sdss data , as we do in figure 3 ,",
    "breaks several degeneracies , mainly between the spectral index @xmath13 and @xmath5 , and improves the constraints .",
    "however , as we can see from figure 4 , models with @xmath8 are still inside the 2-@xmath32 level and are not strongly disfavoured . in the wmap+sdss analysis , the best fit model under the assumption of @xmath23",
    "has @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "these results are close to those from the previous wmap analysis further confirming the reasonable agreement between the sdss data and @xmath8 .    including acbar and cbi experiments to wmap+sdss",
    "improves the constraints on @xmath5 and we get an upper limit of @xmath37 .",
    "while this disfavours the @xmath2 hypothesis , one should also note that other effects like massive neutrinos ( see ) , running spectral index and a scale - dependent bias , just to name a few , could all be present and improve the agreement between models with high @xmath5 and the data .",
    "for example , including a running spectral index in the primordial spectrum , which may be motivated by inflation and/or by a scale dependent bias in galaxy clustering , enlarges the constraints again to @xmath38 . in the case of running spectral index and @xmath39",
    "the best fit parameters are @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44",
    ".    an accurate determination of @xmath45 may be the best way to determine @xmath5 .",
    "unfortunately there is a large scattering in the constraints on @xmath45 from current observations .",
    "a value of @xmath46 is compatible with the determinations inferred from the local cluster x - ray temperature function ( see e.g. ) and cosmic shear data @xcite , but incompatible with other analysis ( see e.g. ) .",
    "recent measurements of galaxy clustering at redshift @xmath47 from the combo-17 survey gives @xmath48 at zero redshift @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to point out that , if the small - scale cmb anisotropy excess measured by the cbi experiment ( see ) is indeed due to integrated sunyaev - zeldovich effect , this would be compatible with a value of @xmath49 @xcite therefore in agreement with a very extended reionization scenario .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : modpar ]",
    "a potential challenge to models with high values of @xmath5 can come from the astrophysical constraints . to address this issue",
    ", we study the implications of a high value of @xmath2 on reionization history of the universe . for this purpose",
    ", we use a semi - analytical model @xcite developed for studying cosmic reionization and thermal history of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "the model implements most of the relevant physics governing these processes , such as the inhomogeneous igm density distribution , three different classes of ionizing photon sources ( massive popiii stars , popii stars and qsos ) , and radiative feedback inhibiting star formation in low - mass galaxies .",
    "the main advantage of the model is that it can be constrained quite well by comparing its predictions with various observational data , namely , the redshift evolution of lyman - limit absorption systems @xcite , gunn - peterson @xcite and electron scattering optical depths @xcite and cosmic star formation history @xcite ; in addition the model also includes constraints obtained by on near infra red background ( nirb ) data @xcite . in this paper , we extend the above model of to include the possibility of a high @xmath5 along with high values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , as discussed in the previous section and reported in table 1 .",
    "the most crucial difficulties in admitting such a high value of @xmath5 within standard reionization scenarios can be divided into two parts . in the first part",
    ", we discuss whether it is possible to have sources which can produce a high number of ionizing photons so as to produce a large @xmath5 .",
    "a common mechanism for obtaining a large @xmath5 is through metal - free popiii stars , which has been used widely ( see , for example , ) , and is in agreement with various set of observations @xcite including the nirb data @xcite . in such scenarios , popiii stars with a photon production efficiency @xmath52 ( where @xmath53 is the star - forming efficiency and @xmath54 is the escape fraction of ionizing photons ) are able to produce a @xmath55 ( the best - fit value obtained by fitting the temperature - polarization cross power spectrum to @xmath56cdm models in which all parameters except @xmath5 assume their best fit values based on the temperature power spectrum ; ) .",
    "one might then expect that a considerable higher value of @xmath57 must be required to produce a @xmath5 of 0.3 .",
    "however , one should also keep in mind that the model with @xmath1 has higher values of @xmath58 and @xmath51 compared to the standard one , which means that ( i ) the number of collapsed haloes is higher and ( ii ) the baryonic mass within the collapsed haloes is larger .",
    "in fact , the value of @xmath57 required to match the high @xmath5 is @xmath59 , which is similar to the value in standard scenarios .",
    "so we conclude that production of a large number of ionizing photons at high redshift does not pose any serious difficulty for models with high @xmath5 .",
    "various other mechanisms for early reionization have been suggested in order to produce a high @xmath5 , most notably being an early population of accreting black holes @xcite .",
    "the accretion of gas onto these black holes or miniquasars would produce a background of hard photons , which have a large mean free path and can ionize large regions of the igm .",
    "however , the constraints from the present - day soft x - ray background imply that these sources can , at most , produce @xmath60 photons per hydrogen atom @xcite , which is much less than the requirement for fully ionizing the igm  hence the reionization from these sourced would be partial . while the nature of reionization ( topology of the ionized regions , thermal state of the igm etc ) would be quite different if it is achieved by the black holes rather than popiii stars , whether the photons from the miniquasars can produce a high value of @xmath61 without violating any other observational constraints needs to be verified .",
    "the second difficulty regarding high values of @xmath5 is whether such a high number of photons at high redshift violate any observational constraints ( see figure [ zt11 ] ) .",
    "the first set of such constraints come from the observations related to the igm .",
    "since there are virtually no observational data on igm at @xmath62 , the most severe constraints on the model comes from the lyman-@xmath63 gunn - peterson optical depth @xmath64 at @xmath65 . in the standard scenario ,",
    "@xmath64 observations are very well matched by the flux from normal popii stars with an efficiency @xmath66 along with a population of qsos as required by data on optical luminosity function .",
    "it is thus necessary that the popiii stars do not have a significant flux at @xmath65 . for the models studied in this paper ,",
    "this provides a mild constraint on the transition redshift of popiii stars @xmath67 .",
    "however , there is another physical process which affects @xmath64 and thus provides further constraints .",
    "this has to do with the mean free path @xmath68 of hydrogen - ionizing photons . at high redshifts ,",
    "the high flux from popiii stars create huge ionized regions , thus producing high values of @xmath69 6080 mpc . once the popiii stars disappear at @xmath70 , these ionized regions start becoming neutral over a recombination time - scale resulting in a gradual decrease of @xmath68 .",
    "however , the constraints on @xmath64 ( taking into account the uncertainty in the value of the slope of the igm temperature - density relation @xmath71 ) imply that @xmath72 few mpcs at @xmath65 . to obtain such low values of @xmath68",
    ", one has to make sure that the popiii stars start disappearing around @xmath73 .",
    "once this condition is satisfied , the model is consistent with various available observations , namely , the redshift evolution of lyman - limit systems , the temperature corresponding to the mean igm density , the cosmic sfr and @xmath64 , as shown in figure [ zt11 ] .",
    "the second set of observational consequence is related to the nirb which is believed to be due to the popiii stars .",
    "the observations of nirb constrain the combination @xmath74 and @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "first , note that the value of @xmath5 is sensitive only to the combination @xmath75 ; hence , it is not difficult to match the nirb constraints on @xmath74 by suitably choosing the values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "second , the decline of the nirb at wavelengths below the j band constrains @xmath76 , whereas the @xmath64 constraints at @xmath77 require that @xmath78 ( as discussed in the previous paragraph ) .",
    "however , the constraint from nirb is not too strong mainly due to lack of reliable data at wavelengths shortwards of the j band .",
    "it is thus difficult to rule out models where the popiii star formation rate starts decreasing gradually from @xmath79 with substantial contribution remaining till @xmath80 .    in conclusion , current observations , related to the igm and nirb",
    ", are not able to rule out models with @xmath2 , though they are only marginally consistent in some cases .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the feasibility of a very extended reionization .",
    "we can summarize our results in    * the first year wmap data is in perfect agreement with an thomson scattering optical depth parameter as high as @xmath9 . not considering this possibility in parameter extraction analysis may bias the results on several quantities like the hubble constant , the baryon density and @xmath45 . * including galaxy clustering data from sdss disfavours models with @xmath81 but not at high significance . similarly ,",
    "inclusion of the cmb data from cbi and acbar improves the constraints to @xmath37 . on the other hand ,",
    "if additional parameters like a running spectral index or scale dependent bias are considered , high @xmath5 models are found to be in better agreement with observations .",
    "* we have therefore studied the astrophysical feasibility of such a high value of @xmath5 , particularly with respect to the observations related to the reionization history of the universe . using a simple semi - analytical model @xcite",
    ", we find that an early population of massive metal free popiii stars with photon production efficiency @xmath82 is sufficient to produce such a high @xmath5 .",
    "however , in order that the photon flux does not violate the lyman-@xmath63 gunn - peterson optical depth constraints at @xmath77 , the popiii star formation rate should start decreasing around @xmath73 .",
    "this value of @xmath70 is marginally consistent with the observations of nirb .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the possibility of a very extended reionization epoch is still not completely ruled out by current data and should be taken into account , especially when deriving reliable @xmath83 constraints from cmb anisotropy measurements . in future ,",
    "more accurate cmb polarization measurements , such as those expected from the planck satellite experiment , together with high accuracy measurements of @xmath45 from weak lensing and galaxy surveys , will be able to verify or rule out this interesting possibility .",
