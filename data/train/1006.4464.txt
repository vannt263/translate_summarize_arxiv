    "in order to determine the physical properties we need the light curve parameters determined above , the velocity amplitude of the star ( @xmath5kms@xmath6 ; @xcite ) , and one additional constraint .",
    "we supply this extra constraint by forcing the physical properties of the star to match predictions from theoretical stellar models , guided by the observed effective temperature ( @xmath7k ; @xcite ) and metallicity ( @xmath8}}= -0.08 \\pm 0.08 $ ] ; @xcite ) . for the parameter",
    "which governs the solution process we use the velocity amplitude of the _ planet _ , @xmath9 .    for the theoretical models we use five different sets of tabulations : _ claret _",
    "@xcite , _ teramo _",
    "@xcite , _ vrss _ @xcite and _ dsep _ @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of this solution process can be found in @xcite and a discussion of the five stellar models and the alternative empirical mass  radius relation is given by @xcite .",
    "the use of five different model sets allows the assessment of their interagreement and thus the systematic error engendered by relying on theoretical predictions . in reality",
    "this will yield only a lower limit on the systematic errors , as the different models have a lot of commonality in their input physics .",
    "there are two parameters which do not depend on the stellar model tabulations  the surface gravity and equilibrium temperature of the planet @xcite  and one for which the dependence is negligible  the stellar density @xcite .",
    "the results of the above analysis are estimates of the physical properties of the wasp-2 system , given in table[tab : model ] for each stellar model set and for the empirical stellar mass  radius relation defined by @xcite .",
    "the mass , radius , surface gravity and density of the star are denoted by @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and of the planet by @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the orbital semimajor axis ( @xmath19 ) , equilibrium temperature surrogate @xmath20 and @xcite number ( @xmath21 ) are also determined .",
    "table[tab : fmodel ] contains the final physical properties from this work , calculated as the unweighted mean of the individual results for the five stellar models .",
    "the statistical error for each parameter is the largest from the models , and the systematic error the standard deviation of the individual model results .",
    "table[tab : fmodel ] also contains results from published studies of wasp-2 , which are in good agreement with our results but are less precise .",
    "obtaining a high - precision light curve is a crucial part of measuring the physical properties of transiting extrasolar planets . in this work we have presented photometric observations obtained through a heavily defocussed telescope and covering three transits of wasp-2 .",
    "the first of these observing sequences has a scatter of only 0.42mmag around the best - fitting model , which to our knowledge is a new record for a ground - based light curve of planetary transit .",
    "these data were analysed with the jktebop code , taking into account the contaminating light from a fainter companion star within 0.76@xmath22  of the sky position of the wasp-2 system . with the addition of the observed effective temperature , metallicity and velocity amplitude of the host star , plus several sets of theoretical stellar model predictions ,",
    "we have obtained the physical properties of the system .",
    "the planet wasp-2b has a mass of @xmath23@xmath1  ( statistical and systematic errors ) and a radius of @xmath24@xmath3 , which is typical for transiting gas giants .",
    "its host star is a 0.8@xmath25  and 0.8@xmath26  k1 dwarf with a large and largely unconstrained age .",
    "the equilibrium temperature of the planet , @xmath4k , puts it firmly into the pl class @xcite .",
    "the high precision of our mass and radius measurements for wasp-2b means this planet is now one of the best - understood teps .",
    "this is partly due to the small scatter in our light curves , but also to the physical configuration of the system .",
    "transiting planets with relatively low orbital inclinations suffer from less correlation between inclination and the stellar radius , resulting in better - defined light curve solutions .",
    "low - inclination teps also spend a larger fraction of their time in the partial phases of their eclipses , making transit timings more accurate .",
    "we find uncertainties of as little as 8s in the times of the three transits presented here : wasp-2 would be an excellent candidate for a transit timing study , and such data would further improve measurements of the physical properties of this planetary system .",
