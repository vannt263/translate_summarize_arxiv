    "a fundamental issue of recent interest is the development of renormalization group ( rg ) methods in nonequilibrium.@xcite besides the discovery of new power law exponents for the conductance induced by nonequilibrium occupation probabilities,@xcite an interesting question was raised whether voltage - induced decay rates provide additional cutoffs of the rg flow.@xcite in this context , the nonequilibrium kondo model has been discussed , which can be realized by a single - level quantum dot ( qd ) in the coulomb - blockade ( cb ) regime coupled via spin exchange processes @xmath10 to two reservoirs @xmath11 . in the isotropic case and above all cutoff scales ,",
    "the exchange couplings @xmath12 are all the same and are enhanced by reducing the band width @xmath13 of the reservoirs according to the poor man s scaling equation @xmath14 , @xcite with @xmath15 ( @xmath16 denotes the inital band width ) .",
    "the enhanced screening of the dot spin leads to the kondo effect with unitary conductance below the kondo temperature @xmath17 $ ] ( ref .  )",
    "( for experiments in quantum dots see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "however , for voltages @xmath18 , it was argued that the system can not reach the strong coupling fixed point since the nondiagonal coupling constants , @xmath19 , are cut off by the voltage @xcite and the diagonal ones , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , by the voltage - induced decay rate @xmath22.@xcite this has raised the fundamental question how decay processes can be implemented in nonequilibrium rg . applying flow equation methods to the isotropic kondo model without magnetic field ,",
    "it was shown within a two - loop formalism in ref .   that the inclusion of a third - order term @xmath23 in the rg equation leads to a cutoff of the rg flow at the scale @xmath24 .",
    "in this paper , we will analyze this problem from a more general point of view and will show within a microscopic one - loop rg formalism that relaxation and dephasing rates will always cut off the rg flow for an arbitrary quantum dot in the coulomb blockade regime .",
    "this confirms the conjecture of refs .   and   and generalizes the analysis of ref .",
    "to an arbitrary qd ( including orbital and spin fluctuations , many levels , interference effects , etc . ) .",
    "we propose to use the real - time rg ( rtrg ) formalism of ref .   with a cutoff defined in frequency space since this approach directly discusses the time evolution of the reduced density matrix of the dot via a kinetic equation .",
    "within this formalism , the decay rates occur naturally as the negative imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of the kernel determining the dissipative part of the kinetic equation .",
    "this has already been demonstrated previously by applying rtrg to the calculation of steady - state transport through quantum dots in the charge fluctuation regime @xcite and to the study of the real - time evolution of the occupation probabilities within the spin boson model.@xcite another advantage of the rtrg approach is the fact that the kernel can easily be inserted self - consistently into the one - loop rg equations of the coupling parameters ( analogous to self - energy insertions within green s function techniques ) , providing the unique possibility to obtain the physical decay rates within a nonequilibrium one - loop rg formalism .",
    "in addition , we also provide a microscopic formalism from which all other standard cutoff scales , such as temperature , energy excitations ( e.g. , magnetic fields ) , frequencies , and voltages , can be deduced analytically .",
    "the original rtrg @xcite was formulated with a cutoff defined in time space for the reservoir correlation function .",
    "this makes it technically difficult to apply the formalism to problems where the interaction between dot and reservoirs is nonlinear as it is the case for quantum dots in the cotunneling regime , where orbital and spin fluctuations dominate transport .",
    "therefore , we use in this work a cutoff defined in frequency space but adapt the same formalism to set up the rg equations as in ref .  .",
    "this leads to a combined time - frequency formalism since the time - ordering of the renormalized vertices is needed due to their operator nature ( the degrees of freedom of the dot are not integrated out within rtrg , and therefore all coupling vertices are operators acting on the dot degree of freedom ) .",
    "the only disadvantage of the analytic formalism presented in this work is still the fact that the irrelevant prefactors of the various decay rates cutting off the rg flow can not be determined unambigiously ; this has to be left for future developments .",
    "first , we apply the formalism to quantum transport through single molecular magnets ( smm ) .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the study of kondo physics can be used for transport spectroscopy of smm,@xcite i.e. , the various anisotropy parameters determining the spin excitation spectrum can be identified . in the regime where the kondo temperature is smaller than the distance to the next spin excitation",
    ", it has been shown that a pseudo - spin-1/2 model can be derived which can be mapped onto the fully anisotropic kondo model with three different exchange couplings @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "interestingly , this model reveals a quantum phase transition by changing the sign of @xmath5 , separating the flow to the weak and strong coupling regimes .",
    "since the exchange couplings depend on the transverse anisotropy parameters , which in turn depend on the coupling of the smm to the leads , this phase transition can be tuned in an experimental setup . using rtrg",
    ", we calculate the differential conductance @xmath25 as function of bias voltage at finite magnetic field and show that the kondo - enhanced conductance at @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the level spacing between the ground state and the first excited state , disappears by tuning the system through the phase transition .",
    "second , we calculate the quantum noise @xmath6 as function of frequency for the isotropic kondo model at finite bias and zero magnetic field . we find that the dephasing rate can be identified by studying the derivative of the noise near @xmath9 .",
    "specifically , it turns out that the noise has a dip at @xmath28 ( see also ref .  , where the noise has been calculated for the toulouse point ) , whereas the derivative @xmath8 shows a characteristic shoulder with a height depending on the dephasing rate .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we set up the general model and show the relation to the nonequilibrium kondo model .",
    "section [ sec : perturbation_series ] summarizes the diagrammatic language in liouville space .",

    "in this work , we have discussed a fundamental model of dissipative quantum mechanics : a local quantum system at fixed particle number coupled via spin or orbital exchange to several electronic reservoirs ( the generalization to bosonic reservoirs is straightforward and goes along similiar lines ) .",
    "we have proposed that a microscopic derivation of cutoff scales from decay rates should be based on a formulation in terms of the reduced density matrix of the local system , since the decay rates occur naturally by their definition , namely , as the negative imaginary part of the eigenvalues of the kernel determining the time evolution of the reduced density matrix .",
    "we have shown that a complete description of decay rates in rg formalism is only possible if one considers the full keldysh structure , since relaxation and dephasing essentially arise from diagrams connecting the upper with the lower part of the keldysh contour . therefore , projecting the rg equation from the very beginning on only one part of the keldysh contour , one can not obtain a microscopic description of decay rates .",
    "although energy broadening terms might still lead to a cutoff of the projected rg flow in this case , the physics of relaxation and dephasing is not included .",
    "therefore , our approach provides a consistent nonequilibrium rg formulation which can identify the generation of energy broadening , relaxation , and dephasing at the same time , together with their influence on the rg flow of the vertices .    within our formalism , a particular problem arises due to the existence of an eigenvector with zero eigenvalue ( the stationary state , which is always present and unique , at least in the absence of symmetry - breaking ) .",
    "it is a nontrivial technical issue to show that this eigenvector does not induce a flow to strong coupling .",
    "we have achieved this for a generic quantum dot in the coulomb blockade regime by analyzing the one - loop rg equations in leading order , including all kinds of boundary vertices determining the dot distribution , the current , and the noise in frequency ( laplace ) space . from a pure physical point of view",
    ", one does not expect that the presence of a stationary state is correlated to the presence of a strong coupling fixed point , since the former is generic and the latter model - specific .",
    "therefore , we believe that our leading - order analysis will hold in all orders but a general technical proof for this is still lacking .",
    "nevertheless , we have demonstrated within a one - loop formulation that decay rates cut off the rg flow generically .",
    "the precise prefactor of the various decay rates can not be determined by our analytic formulation so far , since certain irrelevant contributions of higher - order terms have been included in the one - loop equations , arising from the @xmath324-factors in the definition of the interaction picture [ see , e.g. , eq .  ( [ g_intpic ] ) ] .",
    "these factors are essential to provide a cutoff scale for the generic case , but lead also to the unwanted effect that certain combinations of decay rates occur which prohibit an unambigious determination of the correct prefactor . also here , further developments of nonequilibrium rg are needed to provide generic schemes for problems where the prefactor of the decay rates plays an important role , e.g. , for problems with several decay rates differing by many orders of magnitude .",
    "the formulation of this work is useful for problems which stay in the weak - coupling regime with decay rates of the same order of magnitude . in this case",
    ", the different prefactors will only lead to very weak logarithmic corrections .",
    "we have obtained the physically very natural result that decay rates are only generated when the band width reaches the cutoff scales , defined by voltage , temperature , frequencies , or dot excitations . however , considering the kondo model , when all these cutoff scales are zero , the only energy scale left is the kondo temperature @xmath325 , and we enter the strong - coupling regime for @xmath326 .",
    "an interesting issue for future research is the investigation of the influence of decay rates in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "how or whether decay rates will cut off the rg flow also in this case is an open question and has so far not been analyzed . due to the generic presence of decay rates ,",
