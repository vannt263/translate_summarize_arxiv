    "dna - binding proteins can either be bound specifically , i.e. , such that the structure of the bound proteins exactly matches the entire dna sequence it covers , involving gibbs free energies of some 10 kcal / mol and above ; or it can be bound non - specifically with lower gibbs free energies .",
    "non - specific binding occurs when the bound protein matches only part of the covered dna sequence .",
    "a recent study showed that the repressor protein in @xmath2-infected e.coli bacteria is bound non - specifically with a gibbs free energy of some 4 kcal / mol , causing under typical conditions nearly 90 per cent of the repressor proteins to be bound non - specifically @xcite .",
    "in such a weak binding state , the protein can slide along the dna , performing a 1d diffusion process .",
    "one of the primary tasks of dna - binding proteins is the regulation of gene expression , i.e. , to determine whether ( or not ) a certain gene on the genome is going to be transcribed by rna polymerase . having such processes in mind , we refer to these binding proteins as transcription factors ( tfs ) in what follows .",
    "the typical target search time of such a tf has received renewed attention @xcite , after the detailed investigations by berg and von hippel @xcite .",
    "one - dimensional sliding motion of dna - binding proteins along the dna molecule is an important ingredient in addition to three - dimensional volume diffusion in the efficient specific target search that is observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "there exist , however , situations when the complete target search process of dna - binding proteins occurs while being non - specifically attached to the dna molecule , i.e. , without detaching from the dna before hitting the target .",
    "this could be recently proved for bacteriophage t4 single - stranded dna binding protein gp32 @xcite .",
    "gene regulation is a highly relevant example of a first passage time process , that can , in addition , be probed experimentally on the single molecule level . while one usually considers the first passage of a single random walker , or an ensemble of phantom random walkers , the sliding proteins on the dna",
    "are clearly mutually excluding .",
    "to understand their target search quantitatively , one needs a theoretical model for the first passage of non - phantom particles .",
    "surprisingly , there have been studied only a few cases of diffusion processes of mutually excluding particles , for instance , the diffusivity of particles on a line @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that while some of the results below are known per se for the case of one - particle diffusion or for phantom particles @xcite , in the present case they are based on a mapping of the case of impenetrable particles , a problem that , to our knowledge , has not been studied so far .",
    "we also note that the problem pursued here is therefore also of a more generic interest , pertaining to the modeling of charge carrier motion in effectively one - dimensional geometries ( nanowires , etc . ) or traffic flow , among others .    in what follows ,",
    "we establish a theory for the first passage dynamics of mutually excluding particles along a line ( `` dna '' ) .",
    "we explicitly take adsorption of particles to and desorption from the dna into account , mimicking possible volume excursions of the proteins . apart from the dilute case",
    ", we also address the dense case and the possibility of having more than one species of particles .",
    "our analytical findings are corroborated by simulations .",
    "in the simplest case when @xmath0 identical , mutually excluding particles of size @xmath2 diffuse along a line of length @xmath3 , we can obtain insight into the associated first passage process from scaling arguments . to be precise , the first passage is considered for a target placed at the origin ( @xmath4 ) for particles , that are initially randomly distributed along the line @xmath3 .",
    "we first address the dilute case when the length @xmath5 occupied by the sliding particles can be neglected in comparison to the length @xmath3 .",
    "finite size effects are regarded at the end of this section .     in a one - sided system , as function of the density @xmath6 of excluding walkers that can not occupy the same lattice site .",

    "if there are @xmath0 identical particles placed randomly over the line @xmath3 , they are separated by an average length @xmath15 , i.e. , each of them has a free diffusion length @xmath15 .",
    "for the first of these particle to hit the target site , this requires a characteristic target search time @xmath16 with @xmath17 being the concentration of particles .",
    "the index is meant to distinguish the dilute result from the result ( [ tfull ] ) when finite size effects come into play .",
    "we performed a simulation of particles on a line during which each particle attempts a jump to its left or right nearest neighbor lattice point per unit time . in case the corresponding site is occupied , the step is forbidden , and the particle remains at its original site .",
    "the associated ( dimensionless ) diffusion coefficient of a _ single _ particle per unit length square and unit time is @xmath9 .",

    "we can express the diluteness condition through @xmath21 . to include finite size effects when this limit is not fulfilled in our scaling approach ,",
    "we only need to consider the reduced length of the line available to the random walking particles .",
    "this reduced length is @xmath22 , so that we obtain @xmath23 for the scaling of the mean target search time with the number @xmath0 of particles .",

    "the time evolution of the number concentration @xmath29 at position @xmath38 at time @xmath39 on the semi - infinite interval is then given by the diffusion - reaction equation @xmath40 apart from diffusion , in this equation we take into account adsorption ( with rate @xmath30 ) and desorption ( with rate @xmath31 ) of the tfs , where the desorption is proportional to the number concentration of tfs on the dna .",
    "apart from real physical absorption / desorption processes , this approach might mimic other nonlocal processes such as macrohops ( 3d volume sojourns ) and intersegmental transfer ( hopping from one segment of the dna to another , chemically remote segment , that is close by in geometric space due to looping of the dna ) in a mean field sense . following smoluchowski s approach to diffusion - controlled reactions , we represent the target site by an absorbing boundary condition at @xmath4 , i.e. , when a diffusing particle hits this site , it will be removed .",
    "the possibility of double occupation of sites is disregarded , as it represents a higher order effect proportional to @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , the fact that particles are impenetrable to each other does not change the behavior at low concentrations , since , neglecting the excluded volume , on encounter of two particles it does not matter whether the right particle always stays to the right of the other particle ( impenetrable particles ) , or whether they change roles and the right particle becomes the left one ( phantom particles ) , as long as the particles are indistinguishable , in contrast to the case of distinguishable particles addressed below .",
    "finite size effects due to high occupation , violating the diluteness condition @xmath33 will also be addressed below .",
    "finding the target corresponds to the event when the first particle hits the target site .",
    "mathematically , this is equivalent to the first passage time of a particle from a site @xmath42 to @xmath4 , given by the particle flux into the reaction center , @xmath43 .",

    "we concentrate on the situation without adsorption - desorption processes ( @xmath100 ) . for noninteracting particles , the probability density @xmath162 to find a particle at site @xmath38",
    "is described by the same equation ( [ rde ] ) , however now with the initial condition @xmath163 corresponding to the normalization of the probability density .",
    "the overall survival probability of a given particle in the interval is simply given by @xmath164 .",
    "performing integration over @xmath38 in equation ( [ concentr ] ) giving now ( for @xmath165 , @xmath100 ) the laplace - transformed @xmath166 @xmath167 for exactly @xmath0 particles , the survival probability of the reaction center is @xmath168 : it only survives if none of the particles arrived at it up to the time @xmath39 , and the mean survival time @xmath169 . for @xmath170",
    "one has @xmath171 , so that the mean waiting time diverges . for whatever finite @xmath0",
    "the mean waiting time is finite .",
    "it follows from the fact that the function @xmath172 , which is non - negative and monotonously non - growing , is integrable , and its time integral @xmath173 .",
    "this means that for @xmath174 this function decays faster than as @xmath175 , and thus its powers decay even faster , and are integrable .",
    "for @xmath0 small the value of @xmath27 has to be calculated explicitly . for large @xmath0",
    "a simple asymptotic expression arises : in this case the mean waiting time is much smaller than @xmath176 , with small times corresponding to large @xmath177 . for such",
    "@xmath178 one has @xmath179 \\rightarrow 1 $ ] so that one can put down @xmath180 the inverse laplace transform of this function gives us the small-@xmath39 behavior of @xmath181 , namely @xmath182 for @xmath0 large enough one then has @xmath183 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\approx & \\exp \\left(-\\frac{n}{l } \\sqrt{\\frac{4d_{\\mathrm{1d}}t}{\\pi } } \\right ) , \\label{canonic}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is exactly our equation ( [ pnoad ] ) with @xmath17 .",
    "the approximation is reasonably good starting from @xmath184 particles .",
    "the canonical mean waiting time ( i.e. , the mean waiting time with _ exactly _ @xmath0 particles in the interval ) is then given by the same equation ( [ tau ] )",
    ".    the grand - canonical result can be obtained from the canonical one by simply noting that the grand - canonical expression for @xmath44 corresponds to a weighted sum of the corresponding canonical waiting times : @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the probability to find exactly @xmath0 particles within the interval . taking this probabilities to follow a poisson distribution , @xmath187\\exp(-n_0l)$ ]",

    "we again arrive at equation ( [ canonic ] ) .",
    "however , some care is required when interpreting this result .",
    "since @xmath172 is integrable and thus @xmath189 for @xmath190 , @xmath44 tends for @xmath191 to a constant value , @xmath192 , which is exactly the probability to have no tfs in the interval . in this case , of course , no reaction takes place at all . the mean waiting time , being the time - integral of @xmath44 , clearly , diverges .",
    "if we separate the first , constant , term in equation ( [ grandcan ] ) , we get an expression for @xmath44 which ( for @xmath193 ) is asymptotically the same as equation ( [ canonic ] ) , and calculate the mean waiting time , we again arrive at equation ( [ tau ] ) .",
    "this mean waiting time has however to be interpreted as the mean waiting time for the reaction , provided that it happens at all .",
    "the probability that it never happens is equal to @xmath194 , and is small but finite ."
