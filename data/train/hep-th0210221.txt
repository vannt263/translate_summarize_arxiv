    "after the discovery of tachyon condensation@xcite of non - bps d - branes or brane - antibrane pairs , much studies have been done to investigate the physics of unstable branes@xcite .",
    "some possible roles of rolling tachyons on cosmology in relation to inflation are also discussed by many authors@xcite .",
    "recently sen proposed a new way to quantum gravity by interpreting tachyon field as world lines of non - interating , non - rotating dust@xcite .",
    "the important ingredient of his proposal is that after sufficient rolling down of tachyon to vacuum , tachyon field is almost the same as the time , thus making it possible to identify the elusive intrinsic time in general gravity with tachyon field .    in this paper",
    "we use the hamiltonian formalism while solving the equations of motion to obtain a precise form of time evolution of tachyon field .",
    "we first assume homogeneous tachyon configuration in space , and then generalize it to a more realistic brane - antibrane configuration . in this case",
    "we take the ansatz that near the vacuum tachyon field @xmath0 can be written as a summation of a function of time and a linear function of one of the spatial coordinate @xmath1 it will be proved in section 3 that this kind of ansatz is valid only if the tachyon potential around the vacuum looks like @xmath2 with some constant @xmath3 this is consistent with string theoretic calculations that the tachyon potential should indeed be of that form@xcite .",
    "the potential around the region where d - branes reside is more complicated , and this fact is related to the fact that it is not easy to guess any specific form of the potential around @xmath4 but as long as one is far from the branes , one is able to have a precise form of the time evolution of @xmath5    in section 2 , we briefly introduce the hamiltonian formalism for the usual tachyon lagrangian .",
    "the canonical equations of motion are solved for homogeneous field configuration .",
    "this way of solving the equations of motion is more intuitive and readily applicable to more realistic systems such as brane - antibrane pairs than the lagrangian formalism@xcite . in section 3",
    ", we assume a specific ansatz for tachyon field corresponding to a pair of brane - antibrane . by solving the hamiltonian equation of motion",
    "we obtain a precise form of time evolution of tachyon around the vacuum .",
    "the lagrangian density for tachyon field @xmath6 on a space - filling d - brane system in a flat @xmath7 dimensional space is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 and we use the convention @xmath10 the tachyon potential @xmath11 is known to be maximum at @xmath12 and vanishes as @xmath0 goes to infinity .",
    "instead of using the usual lagrangian formalism for solving the equations of motion , we choose the hamiltonian formalism@xcite which we briefly discuss .",
    "first of all , we compare ( [ cal - l ] ) with the usual lagrangian of a relativistic particle of mass @xmath13 which is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the usual velocity .",
    "when one rewrites ( [ cal - l ] ) in the following form @xmath17 it is clear that there are formal correspondences between tachyonic quantities and relativistic particle quantities such as @xmath18    using the facts @xmath19 @xmath20 and the formal correspondences ( [ ll]-[vt ] ) one may infer that @xmath21 this means that from @xmath22 one obtains @xmath23 in fact one may prove this from the very definition @xmath24 note that whenever @xmath25 @xmath26 and @xmath27 have the same signs .",
    "it is clear that the correspondence rule between @xmath28 and the hamiltonian density @xmath29 is the following , @xmath30 this implies that the tachyonic counter part of the relativistic energy relation @xmath31 is @xmath32 one may prove this directly from the definition of @xmath33 and @xmath34 here , ( [ eq_t ] ) can be proven by using either ( [ definition - of - pi ] ) or @xmath35 another useful relation is the following , @xmath36 which is the tachyonic version of @xmath37    now we solve the equations of motion . instead of solving the usual hamiltonian equations of motion",
    "we solve @xmath38 where the energy - momentum tensor is given by @xmath39 by using the relations @xmath40 and @xmath41 where @xmath42 it is easy to show that @xmath43 reduces to @xmath44    to simplify the problem , we consider first the spatially homogeneous case such as @xmath45 for all @xmath46 in this case the funny factor @xmath47 which appears in ( [ ll ] ) , ( [ vt ] ) , and ( [ eh ] ) is just unity .",
    "the equation ( [ eq - h ] ) now reduces to @xmath48 this means that @xmath49 which is the tachyonic form of @xmath50 is constant during the rolling of the tachyon . using ( [ definition - of - pi ] ) , @xmath51 can be written as @xmath52 this is reminiscent of the energy - momentum relation , @xmath53 of a relativistic particle of mass @xmath54 and velocity @xmath55 the crucial difference is that for usual particles masses are constant , but for tachyons @xmath11 vanishes rapidly as time goes on .    equation ( [ em - relation ] ) can be solved formally as @xmath56 where we assumed that the rolling of tachyon starts at @xmath57 with initial value @xmath58 even though it is not easy to perform the integration explicitly , it can easily be done for the following potential @xmath59 which is known to be an asymptotic form of the tachyon potential . here , @xmath60 is 1 for bosonic strings , and @xmath61 for superstrings .",
    "the relevant useful relation is the following , @xmath62 the explicit solution is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 when @xmath65 is related to @xmath33 by @xmath66    using the asymptotic form @xmath67 for large @xmath68 one finds that @xmath0 approaches rapidly to @xmath69 as @xmath70 in fact it is consistent with the result obtained from lagrangian formalism@xcite .",
    "the advantage of our formalism is that it is more convenient when applied to a complex case such as a pair of brane - antibrane which will be considered in the next section .",
    "instead of homogeneous configuration of tachyon field in space , we consider more realistic one by assuming the following special form of solution @xmath71 here , @xmath72 is one of spatial @xmath73 coordinate , and @xmath74 @xmath75 are finite positive numbers .",
    "this type of configuration corresponds to the tachyon vacuum for large @xmath76    it is known from string theoretic calculations@xcite that the potential around the tachyon vacuum looks like ( [ potential - form ] ) .",
    "it is interesting that this type of ansatz , on the other hand , is valid only if the potential is of type ( [ potential - form ] ) .",
    "we will prove this fact later .",
    "this means that our ansatz is consistent with the general argument of the potential . for @xmath77",
    "the ansatz may not be valid , and may need a cross term of functions of @xmath72 and of @xmath78 this term may be related to the possible modification of the potential ( [ potential - form ] ) for small @xmath5 physical importance of the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) , according to the interpretation of @xcite , is that it corresponds to the tachyon configuration of a brane - antibrane pair .    to solve the equation of motion for the given form ( [ ansatz ] )",
    ", we start from the energy - momentum conservation relation ( [ eq - h ] ) , @xmath79 where @xmath80 corresponds to the sign of @xmath1 this can easily be solved when one makes use of @xmath81 which comes from ( [ definition - of - pi ] ) .",
    "then ( [ eq - h - pm ] ) reduces to @xmath82 using the fact that @xmath83 one may rewrite ( [ eq - h - log ] ) as @xmath84 this can further be simplified by using @xmath85 which can be proven from either ( [ h]-[eq_t ] ) or @xmath86 it means that ( [ d0log ] ) reduces to @xmath87 where @xmath88    from the relation @xmath89 one may guess that @xmath33 is proportional to @xmath90 in fact , by using ( [ definition - of - pi ] ) and ( [ h ] ) , or equivalently by making use of ( [ vt ] ) and ( [ eh ] ) in @xmath91 @xmath33 can be written in terms of @xmath92 in the following way @xmath93 then ( [ eq - h - gen ] ) reduces to @xmath94 the left hand side of this equation dependents only on @xmath95 while the right hand side of it depends on @xmath96 this means that the only possibility is @xmath97 this shows that the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) is consistent with the potential of type ( [ potential - form ] ) .    by introducing a new variable @xmath98",
    "the resulting equation @xmath99 can be written as @xmath100 to solve this we use @xmath101 the final solution is the following @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are integration constants .",
    "note that as @xmath105 @xmath106 which is quite different from the usual one plotted in figure 2 .    by comparing the result to the homogeneous case ,",
    "it becomes clear that the decay mode of the rolling tachyon of a brane - antibrane pair is similar to that of an unstable brane given by ( [ the - solution ] ) .",
    "the only difference is the characteristic decay time which is enhanced by the factor @xmath107",
