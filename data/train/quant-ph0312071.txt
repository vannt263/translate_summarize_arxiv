    "when john bell , then a theoretical physicist at cern , published his now famous theorem in 1964 , it was at first hardly noticed by the scientific community . only within the subsequent decade",
    "the fundamental character of its content was truly appreciated @xcite : in a sense , it fleshed out the notion of entangled quantum systems being potentially correlated in a way that classical systems can",
    "not . entanglement can indeed be viewed as the furthest and most radical departure of quantum mechanics from classical physics . in recent years , yet another shift in the way quantum correlations are perceived has taken place : entanglement has been recognized as a resource that may be exploited to perform completely novel information processing tasks or enhance the efficiency of known tasks . as for any resource , a detailed understanding of its properties and the resulting possibilities and limitations for its manipulation are an important pre - condition for the full exploitation of its potential .",
    "quite naturally , the systematic investigation of quantum entanglement in particular is a major goal of theoretical research in quantum information science @xcite .    this program of research has been initiated with the investigation of the entanglement properties of bi - partite quantum systems prepared in pure quantum states @xcite . today , most characteristics of pure state entanglement are in fact well understood @xcite .",
    "however , our understanding of mixed state entanglement is much less complete .",
    "most proven results are restricted to situations where the constituent parts are qubits , quantum two - level systems , which is due to a whole range of special mathematical properties only satisfied by qubit systems @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the study of bi - partite entanglement between higher - dimensional systems is much more involved .",
    "indeed , new types of entanglement emerge such as bound entanglement @xcite , and one encounters a rich and complex proliferation of types of entanglement with growing dimension of its constituent parts .    considering the complex structure that is emerging even in the case of low - dimensional quantum systems",
    ", one may be tempted to come to the conclusion that to say anything meaningful about the entanglement of infinite - dimensional quantum systems such as field modes of light or harmonic oscillators is an enterprise doomed to failure .",
    "this is , however , not so : it has become clear in recent years that generic statements on the entanglement of such quantum systems can indeed be made .",
    "most importantly , for a large class of states many exact results on entanglement theory can be found , even in cases where there is no finite - dimensional counterpart . a brief description of the development of this theory will be the main subject of this article .",
    "it should be noted that in this article , a certain emphasis is put on the results that the research groups at imperial college and in potsdam have contributed to this area @xcite .    this article will be structured in the following way . after a short introduction to some key notions of entanglement that are valid for any dimensions we",
    "will then move on to outline the key questions that any theory of entanglement will aim to answer when it addresses the resource character of quantum entanglement . some major results and definitions from the theory of entanglement for finite dimensional systems will be presented .",
    "from there we will move on to prepare the ground for the study of the entanglement properties of infinite - dimensional systems by introducing some basic notions that are helpful for the description of states and dynamics .",
    "then we will exhibit some of the problems that occur when one attempts to study entanglement of infinite - dimensional systems without any restrictions",
    ". this will serve as a motivation to restrict entanglement theory to so - called gaussian states . again",
    ", basic results are presented ; we will then ask the experimentally motivated question of the manipulation of gaussian states by gaussian operations . we will outline results that have been obtained on this question , including a no - go theorem concerning entanglement distillation of gaussian states and gaussian operations , and results on general entanglement manipulation for gaussian states . in the conclusions we will outline further developments and applications of the theory of gaussian entanglement in other areas of quantum information science .",
    "the power of entanglement manifests itself particularly clearly in quantum communication tasks that have to be performed over large distances .",
    "such tasks will typically require that , say , two parties involved in the communication protocol establish a shared entangled state of two quantum particles between them . this",
    "may for example be accomplished by one party preparing two entangled particles locally followed by the transmission of one of these particles through a physical channel such as an optical fiber to the other party . for large distances",
    "this task is complicated by the unavoidable presence of unwanted interactions with the environment causing decoherence and dissipation that will tend to destroy entanglement .",
    "the two distant parties that wish to create a shared entangled state between them will therefore generally end up with a partially entangled mixed state .",
    "consequently , in order to be able to implement an quantum communication protocol , they will need to be able to repair the partially entanglement state .",
    "this aim will be hampered by the fact that the parties are spatially separated , as this implies that they can only implement general quantum operations in their respective local laboratories and coordinate their respective actions by classical communication .",
    "global quantum operations affecting particles in separate laboratories are not available to them .",
    "the set of local operations and classical communication is usually abbreviated locc and forms the basis for much of the study of quantum entanglement , though more general classes of operations can also be relevant @xcite .",
    "the very notion of entanglement is actually tied to the set of locc : a state is called disentangled if it can be prepared using locc only .",
    "indeed , the most general two - party state that can be generated from a product state employing locc is a mixture of product states of the form @xmath0 where the tensor product refers to the parties @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "such a state , usually called a separable state , may exhibit correlations , but they are not of genuinely quantum mechanical nature as , again , this state may be created using locc @xcite .",
    "a separable state allows for a description in terms of a local classical model .",
    "any state that can not be cast into the form eq.([separable ] ) ( or appropriately approximated by such a state for infinite dimensional systems ) will be called entangled .",
    "the development of a theory of entanglement , or in other words the study of what can and can not be achieved under locc , is a key concern in the field .",
    "such a theory will generally aim to answer the following three central questions :      while the definition of separability is easy to formulate , it is very difficult to decide in practice whether a given state is separable or not . following eq.([separable ] ) , in order to show that a state is separable , it appears that one has to construct explicitly a decomposition of the state into tensor products .",
    "this is a very difficult and potentially lengthy task especially for high dimensional systems . for low dimensional systems , however",
    ", the separability question can be decided in a different and more efficient way using the theory of positive but not completely positive maps .",
    "in fact , a simple necessary and sufficient criterion for the separability of a quantum state can be based on the properties of the transposition and its application on a single sub - system .",
    "clearly , the transposition is a positive map in the sense that it maps any positive operator onto a positive operator , i.e. , if @xmath3 is positive then so is @xmath4 .",
    "the same then applies when the transposition is applied to one sub - system , say system @xmath2 , of a separable state , because @xmath5 is again a valid state .",
    "however , when we apply this so - called partial transposition to an inseparable state , then there is no guarantee that the result is again a positive operator , i.e. , a physical state . indeed , when applying the partial transposition to the state with state vector @xmath6 ) , we find @xmath7 , which is evidently not positive any more .",
    "this observation gave rise to the conjecture that a state is inseparable exactly if the partial transpose is not a positive operator .",
    "it has indeed been proven that this conjecture is correct for systems composed of two qubits or a qubit and a qutrit @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the partial transposition on qubits corresponds to time reversal .",
    "this observation already suggests the appropriate application of the partial transposition criterion for infinite dimensional systems . in systems with larger dimension that six",
    "the situation is fairly different , and the question of separability is far more complicated : one encounters for example inseparable states whose partial transposition is nevertheless positive again  a phenomenon commonly referred to as bound entanglement @xcite .",
    "while there is a systematic strategy for deciding the separability of a state @xcite , it is known that the problem has a computational complexity that lies in np - hard @xcite",
    ".      a natural next question would be : given a quantum state of which one knows that it is entangled , how can it be manipulated by locc ? one may envision , for example , the situation that an experimental procedure generates a particular state @xmath3 , but that a state @xmath8 different from @xmath3 is actually required . is it possible to achieve the transformation @xmath9 employing locc only ?",
    "in general , this is a extraordinarily difficult question to answer , but some results have been achieved for finite dimensional systems .",
    "most progress has been made for pure quantum states for which the basic structures are known .",
    "there are two regimes which may fruitfully be considered .",
    "firstly , one may study the situation where a single copy of a quantum state is held by two parties ( the multiple copy case is a special case of this setting ) . in this case , the mathematical structure underlying the manipulation of quantum states by locc is provided by the theory of majorization , and both necessary and sufficient conditions for the interconversion between two states are known , together with protocols that achieve the task @xcite .",
    "let us write the initial and final state vectors as @xmath10 and @xmath11 in their schmidt - basis , @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the dimension of each of the quantum systems .",
    "we can take the schmidt coefficients to be given in decreasing order , i.e. , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the question of the interconvertability between the states can then be decided from the knowledge of the real schmidt coefficients only .",
    "one finds that a locc transformation that converts @xmath16 to @xmath17 with unit probability exists if and only if the @xmath18 are majorized @xcite by @xmath19 , that is , exactly if for all @xmath20 @xmath21 various refinements of this result have been found that provide the largest success probabilities for the interconversion between two states by locc together with the optimal protocol where a deterministic interconversion is not possible @xcite .",
    "these results allow in principle to decide any question concerning the locc interconversion of pure state by employing techniques from linear programming @xcite .",
    "although the basic mathematical structure is well understood , surprising and not yet fully understood effects such as entanglement catalysis are still possible @xcite .",
    "secondly , further to the study of the locc transformation of single copies , a fruitful area is the study of the asymptotic regime ie the limit of a very large number of identical quantum states .",
    "while this may be viewed as a limiting case of the above theorem , it has indeed predated it .",
    "it turns out that in this case , a single number , the entropy of entanglement , will determine what is possible and what is not .",
    "the entropy of entanglement for a pure state with state vector @xmath22 is defined as @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the von - neumann entropy defined as @xmath25 $ ] and @xmath26 denotes the partial trace over subsystem b. with this quantity , we find that in the asymptotic limit of a large number of identically prepared systems , the transformation from @xmath27 copies of @xmath28 under locc to @xmath29 copies of @xmath30 will be possible with fidelity that approaches unity in the limit of @xmath27 approaching infinity .      for mixed states",
    "no comparable set of theorems is available .",
    "indeed , even very simple questions concerning the interconvertability of states can not be provided with necessary and sufficient conditions for their availability .",
    "the quest for such conditions together with the questions of the best efficiencies for procedures of salient interest that are available has led to the development of the theory of the quantification of entanglement .",
    "an entanglement measure grasps this notion of quantifying entanglement : it is a mathematical quantity that captures the essential properties that we would associate with the amount of entanglement and that is ideally related to some operational procedure . any function @xmath31 mapping the state space on positive real numbers that deserves the name entanglement measure should satisfy the subsequent list of requirements : @xcite    1 .   @xmath32 vanishes if the state @xmath3 is separable . 2 .",
    "@xmath31 is invariant under local unitary transformations , i.e. , local basis changes .",
    "3 .   @xmath31 does not increase on average under locc , i.e. , @xmath33 where in a locc the state @xmath34 with label @xmath35 is obtained with probability @xmath36 .",
    "4 .   for pure state @xmath37",
    "the measure reduces to the entropy of entanglement @xmath38    a function @xmath31 mapping state space on positive numbers that satisfies the first three conditions is called an entanglement monotone while an entanglement measure also satisfies condition ( 4 ) .",
    "often , convexity of @xmath31 or asymptotic continuity are taken as additional reasonable properties ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "in fact , conditions ( 13 ) together with asymptotic continuity uniquely specify the entanglement measure to be the entropy of entanglement on pure states ( 4 ) , up to a real number that is merely a scaling of the quantity @xcite .",
    "these conditions alone , yet , do not uniquely specify a measure of entanglement on mixed states .",
    "the extremal measures @xcite giving bounds for all others are the distillable entanglement @xcite , quantifying the degree to which maximally entangled states can be extracted under locc from a given supply of identically prepared states , and the entanglement cost @xcite , quantifying the resources in terms of maximally entangled states necessary in a preparation procedure of a state under locc .",
    "the entanglement cost is in fact nothing but the asymptotic version of the entanglement of formation @xcite .",
    "the relative entropy of entanglement quantifies to which extent a given state can be distinguished from a separable state @xcite . in its asymptotic version",
    "@xcite it provides moreover a tight upper bound for distillable entanglement .",
    "practically most straightforward to use is probably the negativity @xcite , which is known to be an entanglement monotone @xcite , and whose logarithm ( up to a constant ) has an interpretation as an asymptotic entanglement cost @xcite .",
    "the very recently developed squashed entanglement @xcite is a convex entanglement monotone that is moreover additive , a property that it shares with the relative entropy of entanglement with reversed arguments @xcite , but it remains finite on pure states .",
    "the same set of questions namely , characterization , manipulation and quantification will have to be addressed in the development of a theory of entanglement . in the remainder of this article",
    "we will outline what has been achieved in this respect in the infinite dimensional setting .",
    "all the above results concern bi - partite entanglement for systems comprising finite dimensional sub - systems such as qubits or qutrits . more recently",
    ", however , considerable effort has been directed towards the study of infinite dimensional quantum systems such as the photon number degree of freedom of light modes @xcite or nano - mechanical harmonic oscillators @xcite , or the state of cold atomic gases @xcite . at first sight",
    ", one would expect the theory of entanglement to become extraordinarily complicated due to the fact that now the hilbert space is no longer finite - dimensional .",
    "indeed , without imposing certain restrictions on the set of states under consideration , one even loses such elementary properties as the continuity of entanglement and its measures @xcite and questions such as distillability become difficult to answer @xcite . in this subsection",
    "we will demonstrate some of the counterintuitive properties @xcite of entanglement measures in the infinite dimensional setting and use them to motivate possible restrictions on the set of states that one wishes to consider .    to clarify this issue ,",
    "let us again consider the joint system to be bi - partite , consisting of parts labeled @xmath1 and @xmath2 , each of which having a finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "both @xmath39 and @xmath40 of the joint hilbert space @xmath41 are taken to be infinite - dimensional , as in case of two modes of light .",
    "we will consider trace - norm continuity , where the trace norm @xmath42 is defined as @xmath43= \\mbox{tr}[(a^\\dagger a)^{1/2}]$ ] for trace - class operators @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it is now quite straightforward to see that the entropy of entanglement ( [ entropyofentanglement ] ) is no longer trace - norm continuous .",
    "the following sequence of states exemplifies this property of the entropy of entanglement : the entropy of entanglement may be very different from zero or even infinite for states that are arbitrarily close to pure product states . in this example , let @xmath44 with @xmath45 as a sequence of pure states @xmath46 defined by @xmath47 and @xmath48 . here ,",
    "@xmath49 and @xmath50 are orthonormal basis that are dense in @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "the sequence of states @xmath53 in fact converges to @xmath54 in trace - norm , i.e. , @xmath55 while @xmath56 . obviously , @xmath31 is not continuous around the state @xmath54 .",
    "in fact , the states with infinite von - neumann entropy is trace - norm dense in state space @xcite . as can readily be verified",
    ", the set of pure states with infinite entropy of entanglement is also dense in the set of all pure states , and hence , the entropy of entanglement is almost everywhere infinite .",
    "that is to say , the assignment of a value which represents the degree of entanglement to an infinite - dimensional quantum system is not entirely unambiguous .",
    "this apparent counterintuitive pathology can nevertheless be tamed to a significant degree .",
    "the key observation here is concerned with the mean energy of the states .",
    "let @xmath57{0.3ex}{0.1ex } } } } + { { { \\sf 1 \\hspace{-0.3ex } \\rule{0.1ex}{1.52ex } \\rule[-.02ex]{0.3ex}{0.1ex } } } } \\otimes h_b$ ] be the hamiltonian of the bi - partite quantum system .",
    "it may appear to some extent unusual in the field of quantum information theory to refer to the hamiltonians of the actual physical systems carrying the quantum states .",
    "we do not require much from @xmath58 at all , however , only that for any finite temperature @xmath59 we have @xmath60<\\infty\\ ] ] for all @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "this is a very natural demand on the spectrum on @xmath58 .",
    "it merely means that there can be no limiting points in the spectrum of @xmath58 : what it physically implies is that the gibbs state , the state of the canonical ensemble , exists",
    ". systems such as the photon number degree of freedom of field modes of light , have this property .",
    "what are the implications for the discontinuity of the entropy of entanglement ?",
    "we observe with @xmath63 that in the above example the mean energy of the sequence of states diverges , @xmath64 & = & \\lim_{k\\rightarrow\\infty}\\sum_{n=1}^{k }         \\frac{1}{\\log(n)^{2}}= \\infty.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this divergence of the mean energy is actually generic for sequences of states with divergent entropy of entanglement @xcite , and is hence not an accident .",
    "this observation suggests how to tame the unwieldy infinities .",
    "after all , the energy that can be invested in the preparation of a state by means of physical devices is in all instances limited .",
    "this does not mean that the resulting states have a finite - dimensional carrier .",
    "it only means that their _ mean _ energy must be bounded .",
    "in fact , it turns out that for the set of states with mean energy which is bounded from above by a positive number @xmath65 , @xmath66 \\leq { e_{max}}\\},\\ ] ] the entropy of entanglement regains its ( trace - norm ) continuity @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath67 denotes the state space , i.e. , the set of all density matrices , which is the set of all positive normalized trace - class operators .",
    "the set eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) is technically speaking nowhere dense in state space as @xmath58 is an unbounded operator , but it is a reasonable subset of the state space : it simply reflects the practically natural requirement that the mean energy is bounded from above .",
    "moreover , restricting the mean energy of the states under consideration recovers a number of asymptotic continuity properties of the entropy of entanglement .",
    "this strengthens the interpretation as the entanglement cost and the distillable entanglement also in the infinite - dimensional setting @xcite .",
    "similar conclusions can be reached for the entanglement of formation and the relative entropy of entanglement @xcite . in a nutshell",
    ", one may say that on subsets of state space corresponding to bounded mean energy , entanglement measures often regain trace - norm continuity .",
    "nevertheless , one has to keep in mind that the actual minimization problems involved in the evaluation of meaningful entanglement measures are often not feasible in the infinite - dimensional setting .",
    "this may again be taken as a very discouraging observation .",
    "however , in many situations of practical interest , where the semantics of the term practical may range from meaningful in mathematical physics to preparable in a quantum optical experiment , it turns out that one does not encounter all possible states from state space . instead",
    ", a most relevant class of quantum states can be described in very simple terms using ( small ) finite - dimensional matrices only , without the need of a description that is overburdened with the technicalities of infinite - dimensional hilbert spaces : this is the set of gaussian quantum states .",
    "this set of states that is of utmost practical importance will be dealt with in most of the remainder of the present article .",
    "gaussian quantum states play a key role in several fields of theoretical physics . in quantum optics , for example , they are often encountered as states of field modes of light , for reasons that will be elaborated on below .",
    "ground states of systems with canonical coordinates ( position and momentum ) where the hamiltonian is quadratic in the positions and momenta are also gaussian states @xcite .",
    "the term has been coined because the defining property is that the characteristic function associated with the state is a gaussian in phase space . for such gaussian states",
    "the theory of entanglement as well as a framework of how these states may be manipulated is well developed .",
    "typical questions in a theory of entanglement , e.g. , concerning the separability of given states , or the interconvertability of pairs of states under local operations can often be answered in full .",
    "this is true even in cases where the finite dimensional equivalent , whenever such an equivalent can be formulated , remains unsolved .",
    "one key reason for these successes is the fact that gaussian states are completely specified by their first and second moments so that questions concerning properties of gaussian states can be translated into properties of ( comparatively small ) finite - dimensional matrices .",
    "therefore the instruments of matrix theory @xcite , so useful in the study of entanglement for finite - dimensional systems such as qubits and qutrits , once more become a useful tool .",
    "the systems that will subsequently be discussed are quantum systems with @xmath13 canonical degrees of freedom .",
    "these could represent @xmath13 harmonic oscillators , or @xmath13 field modes of light .",
    "the canonical commutation relations ( ccr ) between the @xmath68 canonical self - adjoint operators corresponding to position and momentum of such a system with @xmath13 degrees of freedom , may be written in a particularly convenient form employing the row vector , @xmath69 in terms of the familiar creation and annihilation operators of the modes choosing @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 can be expressed as @xmath73 then the canonical commutation relations ( ccr ) take the form @xmath74=i \\sigma_{j , k } \\ ; , \\ ] ] where the skew - symmetric block diagonal real @xmath75-matrix @xmath76 given by @xmath77,\\ ] ] is the so - called symplectic matrix .",
    "the phase space , isomorphic to @xmath78 , then becomes what is known as a symplectic vector space , equipped with the scalar product corresponding to this symplectic matrix .",
    "instead of referring to states , i.e. , density operators , one may equivalently refer to functions that are defined on phase space .",
    "there are many common choices of such functions in phase space , such as the wigner function , the @xmath79-function or the @xmath80-function , to name just a few @xcite .",
    "each of them is favorable in a particular physical context . for later purposes it is most convenient to introduce the characteristic function , which is the fourier transform of the wigner function . using the weyl operator @xmath81 for @xmath82",
    ", we define the ( wigner- ) characteristic function as @xmath83.\\ ] ] in quantum optics , the weyl operator is typically referred to as phase space displacement operator or glauber operator , but with a different convention concerning its arguments . for a single mode ,",
    "let the complex number @xmath84 be defined as @xmath85 , then the phase space displacement operator @xmath86 of quantum optics @xcite is most commonly taken as @xmath87 .",
    "each characteristic function is uniquely associated with a state , and they are related with each other via a fourier - weyl relation .",
    "the state @xmath3 can be obtained from its characteristic function according to @xmath88 in turn , the wigner function as commonly used in quantum optics is related to the characteristic function via a fourier transform , i.e. , @xmath89 gaussian states are , as mentioned before , defined through their property that the characteristic function is a gaussian function in phase space @xcite , i.e. , @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a @xmath75-matrix and @xmath92 is a vector . as a consequence , a gaussian characteristic function can be characterized via its first and second moments only , such that a gaussian state of @xmath13 modes requires only @xmath93 real parameters for its full description , which is polynomial rather than exponential in @xmath13 .",
    "the first moments form a vector , the displacement vector @xmath94 , where @xmath95,\\ ] ] @xmath96 .",
    "they are the expectation values of the canonical coordinates , and are linked to the above @xmath97 by @xmath98 .",
    "they can be made zero by means of a translation in phase space of individual oscillators . as a consequence the first moments do not carry any information about the entanglement properties of the state .",
    "the second moments are embodied in the real symmetric @xmath75 covariance matrix @xmath99 defined as @xmath100 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with this convention , the covariance matrix of the @xmath13-mode vacuum is simply @xmath101{0.3ex}{0.1ex } } } _ { 2n}$ ] .",
    "again , the link to the above matrix @xmath91 is @xmath102 .",
    "clearly , not any real symmetric @xmath75-matrix can be a legitimate covariance of a quantum state : states must respect the heisenberg uncertainty relation . in terms of the second moments",
    "the latter can be phrased in compact form as the matrix inequality @xmath103 in turn , for any real symmetric matrix @xmath99 satisfying the uncertainty principle ( [ res ] ) there exists a gaussian state the second moments of which are nothing but @xmath99 .",
    "so eq.([res ] ) implies the only restriction on legitimate covariance matrices of gaussian quantum states .",
    "this observation has quite significant implications concerning the question of separability of two - mode gaussian states shared by two parties : it has earlier been pointed out that partial transposition is a positive , but not completely positive map .",
    "hence , partial transposition must map separable states onto separable states , but there exist states for which the partial transpose is no longer positive . in fact , for bipartite qubit systems the positivity of the partial transpose is a necessary and sufficient criterion for separability . a necessary condition for separability of gaussian states",
    "can be formulated immediately , once it is understood how partial transposition is reflected on the level of covariance matrices .",
    "indeed , it has been pointed out earlier that the partial transposition on qubits is in fact time - reversal .",
    "time reversal in a system with canonical degrees of freedom is characterized by the transformation that leaves the positions invariant but reverses all momenta , @xmath104 let us now consider a system made up of @xmath68 oscillators , where @xmath13 are held by each party . applying the time reversal operation to the @xmath13 oscillators held by one of the parties , the covariance matrix will be transformed to a real symmetric matrix @xmath105 given by @xmath106 , with @xmath107 .\\ ] ] the matrix @xmath108 is the matrix collecting the second moments of the partial transpose @xmath109 of @xmath3 . as the positivity of @xmath109 is equivalent to @xmath108 satisfying the heisenberg uncertainty principle",
    ", one may now merely check whether @xmath110 if @xmath111 is not positive , then the state @xmath3 must in fact be entangled . for two - mode systems , one mode held by each party , the criterion ( [ crit ] ) is both necessary and sufficient for separability of the gaussian state .",
    "one direction of the proof has been exemplified above , the converse has been proven in refs .",
    "hence , the two - mode gaussian state with covariance matrix @xmath99 is separable exactly if the covariance matrix @xmath112 obtained via partial time - reversal in one sub - system also represents a valid physical state , i.e. , if @xmath113 .",
    "it is remarkable that the above theorem can be extended considerably .",
    "in fact , for a bi - partite system the partial time - reversal also provides a necessary and sufficient criterion for the distillability of a bi - partite gaussian state of two party holds one mode and the other party holds @xmath27 modes , positivity of the partial transpose is still a necessary and sufficient criterion for separability @xcite .",
    "this result together with the discovery of bound entanglement in gaussian systems rely on an alternative criterion for the separability of gaussian states .",
    "in fact , a gaussian state represented by the covariance matrix @xmath99 is separable if and only if there exist covariance matrices @xmath114 and @xmath115 such that @xmath116 this formulation is a very useful tool to prove the validity of statements , but does not serve as a practical criterion for separability , as it is generally not straightforward to find the matrices @xmath114 and @xmath115 ( but note that this may be checked in form of a semi - definite program ) .",
    "in general , given two parties , one holding @xmath117 and the other @xmath27 oscillators , both the question of separability @xcite and distillability can be decided efficiently , although the questions of distillability requires a more sophisticated approach @xcite .",
    "these results are very encouraging but they come with one caveat . while the states have been restricted to be gaussian , no such restriction has been applied to the set of allowed operations . the result concerning the distillability for example only holds when arbitrary operations in infinite - dimensional systems are permitted , even practically very complicated ones such as the distinction between @xmath118 and @xmath119 photons in field modes of light . in the light of this observation",
    ", one should not forget that much of the significance of the gaussian states stems from the fact that the gaussian operations are so important .",
    "this is by no means a tautology : the gaussian operations are those operations that change the state , but preserve the gaussian character of any gaussian input state .",
    "this set of operations is singled out from both a theoretical perspective , but most significantly also from the perspective of practical experimental implementation .",
    "a most relevant question is then what tasks can be accomplished with gaussian states , but not under _ all _ physically available operations , but under gaussian operations only .",
    "this observation motivates the approach described in the next section , namely the investigation of what can and can not be achieved when one restricts attention to gaussian states and the so - called gaussian operations .",

    "it should be noted however , that we will not proceed along the historical lines of development . while the program of the study of gaussian states under gaussian operations has originated in ref .",
    "@xcite for mixed gaussian states , we will begin with an exposition of the state of knowledge for pure states .",

    "in other words , by means of local unitary gaussian operations the pure gaussian state described by @xmath99 can be transformed into a tensor product of two - mode squeezed states @xmath165 characterised by squeezing parameters @xmath166 ( see fig.[figure3 ] ) .",
    "=    as a consequence the non - local properties of a pure gaussian state of @xmath167 modes can be characterised by a vector @xmath168 of two - mode squeezing parameters , which we will always assume to be given in descending order .",
    "this vector will play a role closely analogous to that of the schmidt - coefficients in the majorization criterion for pure state entanglement transformations under general locc operations .",
    "the criterion for pure - state transformations under glocc can now be stated in a very simple manner in terms of this vector of two - mode squeezing parameters .",
    "we write @xmath169 iff @xmath170 for all @xmath171 , in descending order .",

    "in other words , a pure state @xmath3 can be transformed into another pure state @xmath8 if and only if the reduction to one part of the joint system is initially more mixed than finally in the sense of majorisation theory .",
    "this criterion for finite - dimensional systems can be immediately carried over to the infinite - dimensional case , when appropriate care is taken when extending the definition of locc convertibility : one then writes @xmath175 under locc if there exists a sequence of locc , such that the images of the maps approximate @xmath3 in trace - norm .",
    "it is then instructive to compare the restrictions imposed by the majorisation criterion with the constraints under gaussian locc . to start with , under locc , catalysis of entanglement manipulation",
    "is possible @xcite : there exist pure states of finite - dimensional bi - partite quantum systems @xmath3 , @xmath8 and @xmath176 such that @xmath177 the state @xmath176 serves as a `` catalyst '' , as the entanglement inherent in the state is not consumed in the course of the transformation .",
    "such an effect is not possible under glocc and pure gaussian states , as collective operations are never more powerful than operations on pairs of quantum systems at a time .",
    "this notably refers to entanglement transformations only , as one can think of procedures estimating certain properties of gaussian states where collective operations are superior to product operations .",
    "it should moreover be noted that the theorem governing interconvertability under glocc also covers the stochastic interconversion of pure gaussian under glocc , as it has been pointed out in the previous section that any gaussian transformation can be lifted to a trace - preserving operation .",
    "this is again in contrast to the finite - dimensional case @xcite .",
    "it is also an immediate but remarkable consequence of the above criterion that under gaussian local operations with classical communication , one can not `` concentrate '' two - mode squeezing of pure gaussian states . in particular , @xmath178 for any @xmath179 and any @xmath180 , where @xmath181 denotes a two - mode squeezed state with squeezing parameter @xmath182 .",
    "this is very much in contrast to the situation when general operations are allowed for : for any @xmath182 there exists a @xmath180 such that @xmath183 as has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . that is to say , this criterion already points towards the impossibility of distilling gaussian states with gaussian operations .      for mixed states , both",
    "the number of parameters characterizing the state increases and the structure of state transformations becomes far more involved . to start with , a simple normal form such as the schmidt decomposition or the vector of two - mode squeezing parameters",

    "the simplest normal form that can be obtained for two harmonic oscillators is given by the simon normal form for the covariance matrix @xcite .",

    "this latter fact has also been made use of in the proof of the key statement of ref .",
    "@xcite . nevertheless , under certain restrictions on the available protocols and with the help of the simon normal form it is possible to obtain some statements concerning the interconvertability of mixed states and one can find necessary and sufficient criteria for a transformation to be possible .",
    "one such restriction is that to local gaussian channels as have been discussed above : they can be realized by adding an ancilla system , followed by a joint unitary transformation and the subsequent discarding of the ancilla ( see fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] for illustration ) .    for such local gaussian channels , one may write @xmath187 for gaussian two - mode states @xmath3 and @xmath8 , if there exists local gaussian channels @xmath188 and @xmath189 such that @xmath190 ( log stands for local gaussian channel ) .",
    "in fact , both necessary and sufficient conditions for the interconvertability under log can then be proven .",
    "for details we refer the reader to the literature , in particular ref.@xcite and for generalizations for example to a three - party version of the above statement @xcite .",
    "the availability of distillation protocols will be of crucial importance in the infinite - dimensional setting when we wish to implement long - distance quantum communication based on continuous variables .",
    "in fact , such distillation protocols must be performed at the beginning of any procedure that relies on the availability of highly entangled approximately pure shared entangled states .",
    "noise due to unwanted coupling to an environment is never entirely avoidable , and protocols have to be devised that effectively reverse this process . in the finite",
    "dimensional setting , distillation protocols are known , and using the polarization degrees of freedom of light , they can be implemented optically ( although they require photon counters in an iterative procedure that distinguish with great efficiency different numbers of photons ) @xcite .    at the time it seemed fairly natural to expect that such distillation schemes can also be constructed in the case of gaussian states and gaussian operations .",
    "let us hence for a moment assume that pure gaussian two - mode squeezed states have been transmitted through lossy optical systems such as optical fibers .",
    "the resulting states are still gaussian , provided that the noisy channel was a gaussian channel , as is a good assumption in case of optical fibers . in order to distill the entanglement in an iterative procedure , one would take two pairs of identically prepared systems @xmath191 and would feed them into one step of the procedure : the output",
    "could then be taken as the input of the next step .",
    "the states are identical if they underwent the same losses .",
    "the corresponding modes will from now on be denoted as @xmath192 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 , and @xmath195 . a feasible iterative distillation protocol preserving the gaussian character of an input state would look as follows ( see fig .

    "as has been discussed before , this set includes the passive transformations embodying those operations that can be implemented in optical systems using beam splitters and phase shifts .",
    "it however also includes squeezing operations .",
    "for the two - mode case , the set of local unitary transformation is a 20-dimensional manifold .",
    "note that it is not required that both parties implement the same operation . * a homodyne measurement on the modes @xmath193 and @xmath195 .",
    "* finally , the parties communicate classically about the outcome of the measurement , and perform postprocessing of the states of modes @xmath192 and @xmath194 with unitary gaussian operations .",
    "=    it was expected that gaussian operations would be sufficient to provide for such an entanglement purification protocol .",
    "it was however proven in ref .",
    "@xcite that this is not the case . later this proof was extended to demonstrate that entanglement distillation of gaussian state with gaussian operations is not possible in general , allowing in particular for a @xmath68-mode input @xcite .",
    "this is after all quite an astonishing result : no matter how the gaussian local operation with classical operation is chosen , the degree of entanglement can not be increased .",
    "whatever operation is implemented , it will result in a loss rather than in an increase of entanglement .",
    "the optimal procedure is simple : not to even try to distill with gaussian operations alone .",
    "this remarkable result also implies that quantum error correction is not feasible if one is restricted to gaussian states and gaussian operations .",
    "hence , it becomes clear that is necessary to add some non - gaussian resource to the repertoire to ensure that interesting quantum information processing tasks can be carried out in the presence of noise .",
    "the statement has been based on the quantification on the degree of entanglement in terms of the logarithmic negativity that has been mentioned before , which is defined as @xmath199 for a state @xmath3 , where @xmath42 again denotes the trace norm , and @xmath200 is the partial transpose of @xmath3 . for gaussian states it has an interpretation in terms of a certain asymptotic entanglement cost @xcite . in the meantime , it should be noted , the entanglement of formation is also available for the case of symmetric two - mode gaussian states , i.e. , states for which the two reductions of the covariance matrix are identical up to local symplectic transformations @xcite . for pure ( and for symmetric mixed ) gaussian states the logarithmic negativity",
    "is related to the degree of squeezing in a monotone way ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "these considerations , hence , imply again that with gaussian operations alone two identically prepared two - mode squeezed states can not be transformed into a single two - mode squeezed state with a higher degree of squeezing , as has already been pointed out in eq .",
    "( [ maincrit ] ) .      this difficulty sketched in this section  the impossibility of distilling gaussian states with gaussian operations  can however be overcome .",
    "it has been known for quite some time that the unlimited availability of arbitrary non - gaussian operations essentially requiring quantum computation allow for example for entanglement distillation of gaussian states @xcite to finite - dimensional singlets .",
    "this is an important result from the perspective of the theory of entanglement . yet , not only from a practical point of view it would be crucially important to find solutions that make merely use of minimal extensions of the set of operations into the non - gaussian regime , including only those additional operations that are to a high extent feasible in quantum optical settings .    in a nutshell",
    ", it turns out that it _ is _ possible indeed to distill continuous - variable entanglement yielding highly entangled approximately gaussian states , and this can be done in optical systems using passive optical elements and photon detectors only .",
    "such procedures have been introduced and investigated in detail in refs .",
    "the key idea is to leave the gaussian setting in a first non - gaussian step which involves a single measurement only ( corresponding to the positive outcome of a photon detector ) , and then apply gaussian operations only .",
    "the philosophy of the protocol is sketched in the following : some source provides a two - mode squeezed state which is transmitted through fibers whose imperfections turn the states into symmetric noisy but still gaussian states . at that stage",
    "a single non - gaussian operation is carried out which takes the states out of the gaussian state space and may perhaps also increase entanglement .",
    "subsequent to that only gaussian operations are applied in an iterative scheme which serve two aims .",
    "firstly , they further increase the amount of entanglement and secondly , they make the states progressively more gaussian .",
    "asymptotically the states may then have a higher degree of entanglement than the original supply and at the same time approach gaussian states as closely as possible .",
    "=    surprisingly indeed , such a scheme exists using as the only non - gaussian resource a photo - detector that can distinguish between the presence and absence of photons but is not able to count the precise number of photons ( yes - no detector ) @xcite .",
    "the first non - gaussian step takes two identical copies of two - mode squeezed states , and measurements are performed on two of the four modes .",

    "it is an iterative protocol , and it is event - ready , in the sense that one has a classical signal at hand which indicates whether the procedure was successful or not .",
    "no further post - processing has to be performed .",
    "generic weak convergence to two - mode gaussians can indeed be proven , and it can be demonstrated that the procedure often leads to highly entangled and squeezed states . remarkably indeed , the scheme turns out to be fairly robust with respect to detector imperfections @xcite .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to present details of this procedure , however , and the reader is referred to the literature here .",
    "the previous considerations were concerned with the local manipulation of gaussian states .",
    "this is a meaningful approach if one has a distributed system , where the necessity of local operations is simply dictated by the set - up . but how does one prepare the entangled states in the first place ? experimentally , there are several ways to do it , and again , it would be beyond the scope of this paper to present these possibilities ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) . instead , to exemplify the formalism developed before , we concentrate on the optimal creation of entanglement of gaussian states using passive transformations only @xcite . so in this subsection",

    "we have formulated the basic questions that any theory of entanglement aims to answer when we consider entanglement as a resource for quantum information processing protocols .",
    "these key questions are those of characterization , ( local ) manipulation , and quantification of the entanglement resource .",
    "we then pointed out that entanglement theory in finite dimensional systems such as qubits generally requires the availability of arbitrary local operations .",
    "statements concerning the feasibility or efficiency of a particular local state transformation may require the use of operations that are extraordinarily difficult to realize in practice .",

    "this restricted set of operations is of particular importance in quantum optics where it can be shown that gaussian operations are in one - to - one correspondence to the set of operations that can be implemented by simple optical tools such as phase plates , beam - splitters , and squeezer together with the addition of vacuum modes and homodyne detection . in the remainder of the article we then outlined the recent development of this theory and stated some of its key results . in particular",
    "it became clear that processes such as quantum error correction , entanglement distillation and efficient quantum computation are not possible under this restricted set of operations but require some resources that lie outside the gaussian regime .",

    "however , the choice of trace norm is quite natural as two states that are close in the trace norm will yield close expectation values for bounded observables or , in other words , the more difficult it is to operationally distinguish the states with generalized measurements in the non - asymptotic regime ."
