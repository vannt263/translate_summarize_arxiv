    "[ fig : fig2 ] appears blueshifted from the lower polariton minimum by an amount comparable to one - half of the rabi splitting .",
    "this suggests that the emission at the source comes from polaritons with a strong excitonic character .",

    "the emission from the propagating states and collector region , at lower energy , is clearly a polaritonic emission .",
    "it is also important to note that the duration over which the condensate is present greatly exceeds the polariton lifetime .",
    "this is because the condensate is continuously fed by high energy excitons ( not visible in the spectrum and distinct from the excitonic states emitting at the source ) excited by the non - resonant pulse .",
    "the emission at _ s _ is determined by repulsive interactions with hot excitons which contribute a blueshift to the potential energy . as hot excitons decay from the system , either through recombination or condensation ,",
    "this potential energy decreases over time .",
    "once the polariton condensate has formed , due to the low density of polaritons , there are minimal energy relaxation processes , such that the propagating polaritons tend to conserve their energy as they spread out from the source ( see fig .",

    "we define the switch on time , @xmath68 , as the temporal delay between the _ s _ maximum intensity and that of the @xmath0 . it is clearly observed that @xmath68 decreases , and the shape of the @xmath0 time - evolutions becomes more asymmetric with increasing @xmath19 . the asymmetry of the @xmath0 temporal evolution ( see fig .

    "similarly , @xmath70 ( down triangles ) is given by the time interval in which the intensity falls from a value of 1 to 0.5 .",
    "a non monotonic dependence of @xmath70 on power is observed with a sharp raise at low @xmath19 values and a gradual fall for high ones : if the aim is to create a long lived on state , the optimal power corresponds to @xmath71 , where @xmath72 ps . on its own hand , the raise time , @xmath69 , decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath19 , reaching a minimum value of @xmath73 ps : a marked dependence at small powers , followed by an almost negligible decay at high ones , results in an optimum power to create a fast response transistor at similar powers than those required for a long lived on state .",

    "( @xmath74 , open diamonds ) . the monotonous decrease of @xmath68 with power ( increase of switching rate ) is linked to the increase of @xmath74 , due to the enhanced polariton acceleration from _ s _ to _ c _ produced by the augmented photo - generated repulsive excitonic potential , but other contributions as , for example , increase of stimulated scattering processes in the creation of @xmath0 are also responsible for the quickening of @xmath68 .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath68 , @xmath75 ps , corresponds to a polariton propagation speed of @xmath76  @xmath8m / ps in agreement with the values of @xmath42 obtained from the horizon established by @xmath31 in the energy maps of fig  [ fig : fig8 ] ( a - c ) .",
    "finally , we should mention that our results indicate that the optimal conditions for gating are obtained for @xmath77 , in agreement with the previous results of ref .  .",
    "at this power , the maximum attenuation of the @xmath0 condensate is obtained yielding the highest contrast for the off state ; at lower values of @xmath22 the traveling polaritons are not gated efficiently and at higher values the gate starts feeding @xmath0 .",
    "to model our experimental results theoretically , we make use of a phenomenological treatment of polariton energy - relaxation processes taking place in the system . such processes are not only responsible for the relaxation of hot excitons ( injected by the pump ) into polaritons in the form of a condensate , but also for the further relaxation in energy of the polariton condensate as it propagates .",
    "this latter energy relaxation process can be strongly influenced by a spatially dependent potential coming from repulsion from the hot excitons .",
    "let us first introduce the description of the polariton condensate , which we will later couple to a description of higher energy excitons .",
    "a fundamental feature of bose - einstein condensates is their spatial coherence that allows them to be well described with a mean - field approach .",

    "@xmath83 represents the strength of polariton - polariton interactions .",
    "being repulsive ( @xmath84 ) , these interactions allow both a spatially dependent blueshift of the polariton condensate energy and energy - conserving scattering processes .",
    "our analysis shows , however , that neither of these effects play a dominant role in our experiments .",
    "the effective potential acting on polaritons caused by repulsive interactions between polaritons and higher energy excitons is more significant , and is responsible for the blocking of polariton propagation in the presence of a gate pump .",
    "the effective potential @xmath85 can be divided into a contribution from three different types of hot exciton states , which will be described shortly , as well as a static contribution due to the wire structural potential , @xmath86 : @xmath87\\notag\\\\ & \\hspace{5mm}+v_0(x)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 correspond to density distributions of  active \" ,  inactive \" and dark excitons , respectively , as described below .",

    "@xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 define the strengths of interaction with the various hot exciton states .",
    "@xmath88 represents the density distribution of an `` active '' hot exciton reservoir .",
    "@xcite these excitons have the correct energy and momentum for direct stimulated scattering into the condensate and so appear as an incoherent pumping term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gp ] ) with @xmath94 the condensation rate . to describe the dynamics of the system , it is important to note that not all excitons in the system are in this active form .",
    "in fact , the non - resonant pumping creates excitons with very high energy and they must first relax in energy before becoming active .",
    "we can thus identify an `` inactive '' reservoir of hot excitons that is excited by the non - resonant pump but not directly coupled to the condensate .",
    "the dynamics of the exciton densities are described by rate equations : @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 when solving the equations we start from the initial condition @xmath98 , @xmath99 and introduce a density proportional to the pump intensity profile in the inactive reservoir , @xmath100 .",
    "this represents an instantaneous injection by the non - resonant ultra - short pulse used in the experiment .",
    "the inactive reservoir is coupled by both linear and non - linear terms to the active reservoir , described by @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively",
    ".    we also account for a linear coupling to a dark exciton reservoir , @xmath103 , described by coupling rate @xmath104 .",
    "dark excitons are long - lived states that are optically inactive yet can nevertheless be populated as high energy excitations from the non - resonant pump relax in energy .",
    "the dark excitons introduce a long - lived repulsive contribution to the effective polariton potential , @xmath85 , and are thus efficient at gating propagating polaritons at long - times .",
    "@xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 describe the decay rates of each of the reservoirs .",
    "the feeding of dark excitons from the inactive reservoir represents processes where higher energy electron - hole pairs relax in energy forming dark exciton states .",
    "we have neglected any further conversion between bright and dark excitons .",
    "nonlinear conversion has been shown to generate oscillations between bright and dark excitons .",
    "@xcite however , these processes require coherent excitation of exciton - polaritons near the dark exciton resonance . in our case",
    ", we do not expect accumulation of exciton - polaritons at such an energy .",
    "furthermore , the fact that no oscillations in the polariton condensate density were observed , suggests that any coupling between bright and dark states is slower than the condensation rate .",
    "it is worthwhile mentioning that we have also considered hot - exciton diffusion along the wire when solving eqs .",

    "the final term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gp ] ) accounts for energy relaxation processes of condensed polaritons .",
    "polaritons are expected to condense at the source into the lowest energy state , where they have zero kinetic energy and potential energy given by @xmath85 ( and an additional blueshift due to polariton - polariton interactions ) .",
    "while this is the lowest energy state available at the source , one notes that the potential energy can be reduced if polaritons propagate away from the source ( @xmath85 decreases away from the source , where the reservoir densities are weaker ) .",
    "if polaritons were to conserve their energy , then they would convert this potential energy into kinetic energy as they move away from the source , accelerating down the potential gradient .",
    "however , the polariton kinetic energy can be lost as polaritons scatter with acoustic phonons  @xcite or hot excitons .",
    "@xcite surface scattering could be also responsible for this loss ; however since we have considered a phenomenological energy relaxation , the actual mechanism that causes that relaxation does not play a direct role in our calculations .",
    "previous methods to introduce energy relaxation into a description of polariton condensates have been based on the introduction of an additional decay of particles depending on their energy  @xcite ( occasionally known as the landau - khalatnikov approach ) .",

    "[ fig : time_2 ] shows the onset of stimulated energy relaxation processes .",
    "as in the experimental case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) the relaxation takes place in two subsequent stages : first there is relaxation from the source state into the extended state with energy set by the ridge potential , followed by relaxation into the @xmath0 condensate at low energy .    at @xmath46 , fig .",

    "[ fig : fig12 ] ( c ) , the blueshift of the condensate at the source position does not increase linearly with the pump power .",
    "this is because even though the injected hot exciton population can be expected to increase linearly , the increased carrier density results in a faster condensation rate due to the stimulation of scattering processes ( hot exciton relaxation processes as well as processes that cause excitons to relax into condensed polaritons ) .",
    "polaritons decay much faster than uncondensed hot excitons , such that a high intensity pumping of hot excitons is quickly depleted giving rise to a limited blueshift of polaritons at the source .",

    "this behaviour is in qualitative agreement with the experimental result , however , it can be noted that the speed of propagation appears overestimated in the theory .",
    "this is because the theory neglects changes in the shape of the polariton dispersion caused by the hot - exciton induced blueshift , which can be particularly important at early times when the particles are strongly excitonic with a larger effective mass and slower group velocity .",
    "figures  [ fig : peak ] ( b ) and ( c ) show the peak emission energy maps for increasing source intensity , where the relaxation into an extended state with lower energy than the source can be identified . the relaxation is stronger at the highest pump power , due to increased stimulated energy relaxation processes .",

    "the energy of the collector state is low , although it should be noted that it is populated with a negligible density , panel ( d ) .",
    "the weak tunneling of particles across the gate is better evidenced by the increase of the collector state energy , since the tunneling particles have higher energy than the collector ground state . at these low gate powers , the theory appears to predict a high number of polaritons passing the gate .",
    "these polaritons have relatively high momentum and are expected to be less visible experimentally due to reduced photonic fractions .",

    "the short lifetime of the condensate for pumping at threshold ( fig .",

    "the nonlinearity of energy - relaxation processes throughout the system , those causing relaxation between polariton states as well as relaxation between higher energy exciton states , is necessary to explain features of the experimental results . approximating the system as a 1d system , we are able to describe the main qualitative features of the experiment .",
