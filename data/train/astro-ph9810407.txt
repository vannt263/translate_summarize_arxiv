    "the type ii linear supernova ( sn ii - l ) sn 1980k in ngc 6946 reached a peak brightness of v = 11.4 in november 1980 ( see barbon , ciatti , & rosino 1982 ; @xcite and references therein ) . despite a steadily declining flux through 1982 ( @xcite ) , faint h@xmath1 emission from sn 1980k was detected in 1987 through narrow passband imaging ( @xcite , hereafter fb90 ) .",
    "low - disperson optical spectra obtained in 1988 and 1989 showed broad , 6000 km s@xmath0 h@xmath1 and [ o  i ] 6300,6364   emission , along with weaker line emission from [ ca  ii ] 7291,7324    and/or [ o  ii ] 7319,7330  , [ o  iii ] 4959,5007  , and [ fe  ii ] 7155   ( fb90 ; @xcite ; leibundgut et al .",
    "monitoring of its optical flux from 1988 through 1992 indicated a nearly constant luminosity ( leibundgut , kirshner , & porter 1993 ; fesen , & matonick 1994 , hereafter fm94 ) .",
    "following the optical recovery of sn  1980k , a handful of other sne ii - l have been optically detected 7  25 yr after maximum light .",
    "these include sn  1986e in ngc  4302 ( @xcite ) , sn  1979c in m100 ( @xcite ) , and sn  1970",
    "g in m101 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the late - time optical spectra of all these sne show broad h@xmath1 and forbidden oxygen emission lines , and these characteristics have been exploited in searching for fainter , late - time sne",
    "ii - l ( e.g. , sn 1985l in ngc  5033 ; fesen 1998 ) .    of",
    "the few sne ii - l recovered at late times , sn  1979c in m100 ( ngc 4321 ) is particularly noteworthy .",
    "this sn was exceptionally bright at outburst for a type ii event , with a peak @xmath10 of 20 mag ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and became bright in the radio as well , eventually reaching a 6 cm luminosity more than 200 times that of cas a ( weiler et al . 1989 ) .",
    "it also exhibits among the highest , late - time h@xmath1 luminosity ( @xmath11 @xmath12 10@xmath13 erg s@xmath0 ) and shows radio emission variability which may be due to a periodic modulation of the progenitor s pre - sn mass loss ( @xcite ) .",
    "late - time optical sn ii emission lines are thought to arise from interactions with surrounding circumstellar mass loss material ( csm ) .",
    "these interactions lead to the formation of a reverse shock moving back into the expanding ejecta which then subsequently ionizes , either by far - uv or x - ray emission , a broad inner ejecta region from which the optical lines are produced ( chevalier & fransson 1994 , hereafter cf94 ) .",
    "this model is also consistent with the presence of accompanying nonthermal radio emission in all optically recovered sne ii - l , with radio light curves like those predicted from the `` mini - shell '' model involving shock generated synchrotron emission from the forward shock ( chevalier 1982 ; weiler et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "late - time sn ii emission lines are important for the information they can provide on sne ejecta abundances , late - time shock emission processes , and the mass - loss history and evolutionary status of sn progenitors ( leibundgut et al . 1991 ; @xcite , montes et al .",
    "1998 ) . unfortunately ,",
    "optical emission lines from old sne ii - l are quite faint ( @xmath14 10@xmath15 erg @xmath5 s@xmath0 @xmath0 ) , making accurate measurements difficult even using 4-m class telescopes .",
    "consequently , much is still uncertain about their spectra , even for sn  1980k , the best and longest studied object .",
    "for example , virtually nothing is known about sn ii - l spectra below 5000  , and uncertainties remain as to whether [ ca  ii ] or [ o  ii ] is chiefly responsible for the strong emission commonly seen near 7300  .",
    "sn  1980k s current optical properties are of special interest due to a recently reported sharp decline in nonthermal radio flux in the interval 19941997 ( montes et al .",
    "1998 ) .    here",
    "we present a 1995 keck spectrum of sn 1980k which shows the region below 5000   for the first time , and a november 1997 mdm spectrum useful for investigating its recent h@xmath1 flux .",
    "we then compare these sn  1980k data to a 1993 mmt spectrum of sn  1979c at a similar age to the keck sn  1980k spectrum .",
    "we also present a 1997 _ hst _ uv spectrum of sn  1979c which reveals several strong uv and near - uv lines which help clarify the nature of the observed emission .",
    "finally , we outline some general observed properties of late - time sne ii - l and compare them with young galactic supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "two consecutive low - dispersion spectra of sn 1980k were obtained on 28 november 1995 with the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; @xcite ) at the cassegrain focus of the keck - i telescope .",
    "the duration of each exposure was 30 minutes .",
    "conditions were not photometric , and the seeing was about 1@xmath16 .",
    "the position angle of the slit ( of width @xmath17 ) was 128.5 degrees , through two stars that are known to be colinear with the supernova position ; this was also close to the parallactic angle at the time of observation .",
    "we used a tektronix 2048 x 2048 pixel ccd with a scale of @xmath18 per binned pixel in the spatial direction , a gain of 1.1 e@xmath19/count , and a readout noise of 6 e@xmath0/pixel .",
    "cosmic rays were eliminated from the two - dimensional spectra through a comparison of the pair of exposures .",
    "the background sky was measured in regions adjacent to the supernova , and subtracted from the extracted spectrum .",
    "spectra of hg - kr - ne - ar comparison lamps were used to determine the wavelength scale and resolution ( @xmath20   ) .",
    "flux calibration and removal of telluric absorption lines were achieved with a spectrum of the sdf star bd+174708 ( @xcite .",
    "a spectrum of sn  1980k was also obtained on 3 november 1997 using the 2.4 m hiltner telescope at the mdm observatory on kitt peak . a modular spectrograph like that in use at las campanas observatory",
    "was employed with a n - s aligned @xmath21 slit , a 600 line mm@xmath0 5000   blaze grating , and a 1024 x 1024 tektronics ccd detector . a single 6000 s exposure covering the spectral region 4000  8500",
    "  was taken with a spectral resolution of about 5  .",
    "cosmic rays were removed using standard iraf routines for pixel rejection and replacement . observing conditions were photometric but due to slit light losses caused by variable seeing during the long exposure , absolute fluxes are reliable only to @xmath22% .",
    "a spectrum of sn  1979c was obtained on 21 may 1993 using the red channel long - slit ccd spectrograph ( schmidt , weymann , & foltz 1989 ) on the 4.5-m multiple mirror telescope ( mmt ) .",
    "three 1200 s exposures were taken using a @xmath23 slit and covering a spectral range 3800  9900   with 12   resolution .",
    "a strong blue continuum , possibly from o and b stars near sn  1979c s location in ngc 4321 ( m100 ) , was removed in the final reduction and an arbitrary zero flux level set .",
    "because of the greatly increased noise level redward of 8000  , we show here only the region 4000 to 8000  .    an _ hst _ spectrum of sn 1979c was obtained using the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) on 30 january 1997 . three g270h exposures ( 2200  3275  ) were taken for a total time of 7170 s , plus one g400h spectrum ( 3250  4750  ) with an exposure of 2410 s. both the g270h and g400h data shown here have been smoothed by a 5 point average .",
    "the keck and mdm spectra of sn  1980k are shown in figures 1 and 2 respectively .",
    "though the keck spectrum has significantly higher s / n , both show broad h@xmath1 and [ o  i ] 6300,6364   lines plus emission near 7100   and 7300  .",
    "these features have been seen in earlier sn  1980k spectra with roughly the same relative strengths and widths as seen here .",
    "however , the line profiles are better defined in the keck data and the spectrum reveals other fainter emission lines not previously seen .",
    "* h@xmath1 : * sn 1980k s late - time optical flux was first detected in 1987 via its strong h@xmath1 emission and it remains among the strongest optical lines observed a decade later . the 1995 keck spectrum shows the h@xmath1 line profile with an expansion velocity of 5700 to + 5500 km s@xmath0 with a strong asymmetry toward the blue , in good agreement with earlier 1992 and 1994 measurements ( fm94 ; fesen , hurford , & matonick 1995 , hereafter fhm94 ) .",
    "a comparison of sn  1980k s h@xmath1 line profile and strength changes over the last ten years is shown in figure 3 using the lick june 1988 spectrum ( fb90 ) and our november 1997 mdm data .",
    "besides illustrating a drop in h@xmath1 flux over this time period ( see section 4 below ) , one also sees a substantial decrease in the line width , most noticeable toward the blue edge . in 1988 ,",
    "the fwhm of h@xmath1 was around 220  , compared to 190   in 1997 .",
    "this decrease is consistent with earlier measurements ( fm94 ) and is predicted by sn ",
    "csm interaction models ( cf94 )",
    ". however , the asymmetric profile of h@xmath1 appears not to have changed much during the last ten years , with a sharp blue emission edge and an emission peak near 6500   visible in both the 1988 and 1997 line profiles .",
    "a faint , unresolved line is seen on top of the broader h@xmath1 emission around zero radial velocity .",
    "a narrow h@xmath1 emission feature was evident in the 1988 lick spectrum , but much less so in subsequent data ( fm94 ; fhm95 ) . well detected again here , this narrow h@xmath1 emission may be due to a small h  ii region near the sn site or ionized wind material associated with the progenitor ( fb90 ; fhm95 ) .    from the 1997 mdm spectrum",
    ", we estimate a broad emission h@xmath1 flux of @xmath4 erg @xmath5 s@xmath0 .",
    "this is close to the 1.4 @xmath24 10@xmath25 erg @xmath5 s@xmath0 value reported by fhm95 for a 1994 spectrum and supports the conclusion of a @xmath7 25% fading from flux levels observed in the late 1980s and early 1990s .",
    "* h@xmath26 : * there is broad emission near 4850  , some of which may be due to h@xmath26 4861  . its line strength , however , is difficult to disentangle from other possible emission lines between 4800 and 5000   ( see below ) .",
    "nonetheless , the observed h@xmath1/h@xmath26 line ratio must be @xmath27 6 , suggesting , after correcting for a foreground reddening of e(b  v ) = 0.40 mag ( @xcite ) , an intrinsic value @xmath27 4 .",
    "* h@xmath28 : * weak emission near 4350   may be attributable in part to h@xmath28 emission , blended with [ o  iii ] 4363  .    *",
    "[ o  i ] : * the broad [ o  i ] 6300,6364   emission is asymmetric towards the blue with a steep blue edge and a more gradual decline toward the red . the line s full velocity range is 6000 km s@xmath0 if attributed to 6300   on the blue side , and @xmath27 + 1700 km s@xmath0 if attributed to 6363   on the red .",
    "the blueward velocity is larger than the 4800 km s@xmath0 estimated by fm94 , probably due in part to weaker emission detected due to the higher s / n in the keck spectrum .",
    "in addition , a prominent emission peak at 6280    suggests strong clumping of the o - emitting material in the sn s facing expanding hemisphere .    * [ o ii ] : * one of the strongest emission features in the spectrum , rivaling h@xmath1 and [ o  i ] , lies near 7300  , and extends from 7180 to 7420  .",
    "it has been alternatively identified as [ ca ii ] 7291,7324   ( @xcite ; fhm95 ) , [ o  ii ] 7319,7330 (in sn1979c ; fm93 ) , or a combination of the two ( fb90 ; fm94 ) .",
    "cf94 suggest it is likely to be solely [ ca ii ] since these [ o  ii ] lines are weak in a variety of sn  csm models and in a variety of photoionized objects .",
    "however , these models also predict appreciable ca  ii infrared triplet emission ( 8498 , 8542 , 8662  ) which is absent in sn  1980k s near - ir spectrum ( fm94 ; fhm95 ) .",
    "figure 4a shows sn  1980k s [ o  i ] 6300,6364   line profile in terms of expansion velocity relative to 6300   compared to the 7300   feature if identified as the [ o  ii ] line blend at 7325   ( top panel ) , or [ ca  ii ] using the stronger",
    "7291   [ ca  ii ] line ( bottom panel ) . the [ o  ii ] blend interpretation is seen to provide a better match to [ o  i ] s line width and its emission substructure than a [ ca  ii ] interpretation .",
    "for instance , the 6280   emission peak in the [ o  i ] line profile matches well with the 7300   feature s emission feature at 7300   if interpretated as an [ o  ii ] blend . in addition , the velocity of the 7300   feature s fwhm blueward edge agrees within measurement uncertainties to those of [ o  i ] and h@xmath1 using the 7319   [ o  ii ] line : namely , 4750 , 4500 , and 4600 km s@xmath0 for [ o  i ] , h@xmath1 , and 7300 respectively , compared to 3450 km s@xmath0 using [ ca  ii ] 7291  .    a possible complication is an atmospheric absorption band at 7190   which might have affected the 7300   feature s blue emission .",
    "this telluric absorption band is not especially strong , however , and though it could help to explain the poor [ ca  ii ] profile match to that of [ o  i ] at large negative velocities ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , there still would remain the discrepancy along the line s red end .",
    "we therefore conclude that [ o  ii ] 7319,7330   emission is the dominant cause for the 7300   emission feature .    * [ o iii ] : * previous sn 1980k spectra detected broad emission near 5000 with an emission peak near 4955  .",
    "the broad emission was initially identified as [ o  iii ] 4959,5007   emission ( fb90 ; @xcite ; fm94 ) although @xcite suggested it might be a blend of permitted fe  ii lines . as seen in figure 1 ,",
    "broad emission extends from 4750 to 5020 and from 5100 to 5400  , with little emission between 5020 and 5100  .",
    "absence of strong emission just redward of 5007   is hard to reconcile with a broad , 5000 km s@xmath0 [ o  iii ] line profile like seen for [ o  i ] , [ o  ii ] , and h@xmath1 unless the [ o  iii ] emission is weak and has a strong blue asymmetry .",
    "in fact , the sharp cutoff of emission at 5020   places an expansion limit on strong [ o  iii ] 5007   emission of @xmath29 km s@xmath0 . nonetheless , [ o  iii ] appears a much more likely identification than either permitted or forbidden fe  ii and fe  iii lines ( cf .",
    "fhm95 ) , especially in view of the clear [ o  iii ] emission in other sne ii - l ( e.g. , sn 1979c ; see section 3.2 ) .",
    "the far blue side of the feature is probably due to h@xmath26 4861  .",
    "finally , weak emission near 4350   may be a blend of [ o  iii ] 4363   and h@xmath28 .",
    "the keck spectrum also shows two narrow lines at 4957 and 5005  .",
    "these are probably related to the narrow h@xmath1 emission observed .",
    "however , in many earlier spectra , only one emission spike , around 4950  4960  , could be clearly seen ( fb90 ; @xcite ; fm94 ) and was interpreted as possible evidence of emission substructure in the 4959,5007 [ o",
    "iii ] blend .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the narrow 4959   line emission happens to coincide with a @xmath30 km s@xmath0 emission feature in the broad [ o  iii ] line , like that seen in the [ o  i ] and [ o  ii ] line profiles .    *",
    "[ fe ii ] : * emission near 7100   which merges into the red wing of the 7300   line is likely [ fe  ii ] 7155   ( fb90 ; fm94 ) .",
    "adopting a line center of 7100   gives an emission centroid velocity of 2300 km s@xmath0 .",
    "emission extends toward the blue as far as @xmath7 7010   suggesting a maximum velocity of 6000 km s@xmath0 . due to the blend with the [ o  ii ] 7300   feature , little can be determined regarding its maximum recession velocity .",
    "however , the line extends at least to 7175   ( + 800 km s@xmath0 ) .    broad weak emission from 5020 to 5400   can be understood in terms of blends of several [ fe  ii ] lines  specifically the 5112 ( 19f ) , 5158 ( 18f ) , 5159 ( 19f ) , 5262 ( 19f ) , 5269 ( 18f ) , 5273 ( 18f ) , and 5334 ( 19f )   lines .",
    "these represent all of the stronger [ fe  ii ] lines from the multiplets 18f and 19f typically seen in shocked supernova remnant emissions ( cf . fesen & hurford 1996 ) .",
    "adopting a line center shift of 2300 km s@xmath0 and a velocity width of 6000 to + 3500 km s@xmath0 like that seen for the [ fe  ii ] 7155   line , a blend of [ fe  ii ] lines can explain the 50205400   emission : specifically , its width , peak intensity near the strong 5158 and 5159 [ fe  ii ] lines , and the lack of emission longward of 5400   and shortward of 5050  .",
    "* [ s ii ] : * the weak emission feature near the blue end of the keck spectrum appears to be [ s  ii ] 4069,4076  . adopting this identification ,",
    "sulfur has a velocity range of @xmath31 to + 4000 km s@xmath0 , comparable to the broad h and o lines . as with other lines , the [ s  ii ] profile also shows a strong blue asymmetry , with a line center shifted to the blue at least 2000 km s@xmath0 .",
    "finally , we note there is no obvious emission from the nebular [ s  ii ] 6716,6731 lines in either the keck or mdm spectra , and previous sn  1980k studies have failed to detect any [ s  iii ] 9069,9531   emission ( fhm95 ) .        a 1993 mmt spectrum of sn  1979c taken 14 yr after maximum light , or roughly the same age as sn  1980k when the 1995 keck spectrum was obtained , is shown in figure 5 .",
    "the spectrum is similar to those presented by fm93 but with much improved s / n especially in the blue .",
    "* h@xmath1 : * broad h@xmath1 emission is detected with an expansion velocity of @xmath32 km s@xmath0 .",

    "we measure peaks at 6230 and 6320    ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 km",
    "s@xmath0 if attributed to just the 6300   line ) , whereas fm93 found peaks at 6214 and 6329    ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 km s@xmath0 ) .",

    "a june 1998 2.4 m mdm [ o  i ] image of sn  1979c taken using the same filter used by fm93 indicates a 10% increase in [ o  i ] luminosity between 1991.5 and 1998.5 .    *",
    "[ o ii ] : * fm93 identified the emission near 7300   as [ o  ii ] 7319,7330   based upon the excellent match of the feature s double - peaked velocity profile with the [ o  i ] emission peaks .",

    "these correspond to @xmath41 and @xmath42 km s@xmath0 in m100 s rest frame , in agreement with the above measured [ o  i ] peak velocities .",
    "this is graphically shown in figure 4b and helps validate the [ o  ii ] identification made for the sn  1980k spectrum .",
    "we note that the [ o  ii ] 7319,7330   emission appears stronger in 1993 relative to [ o  i ] when compared to 1991/1992 data ( fm93 ) , making it now the strongest feature in sn  1979c s optical spectrum .    * [ o iii ] : * the mmt spectrum of sn  1979c also shows broad , strong [ o  iii ] emission centered at 4965   and spanning 4880 to 5060  , which translate to @xmath39 to + 1600 km s@xmath0 .",

    "these lines show clumpy and strongly asymmetric profiles with the blueward peaks about twice as bright as those along the redward side , suggestive of internal dust extinction of the receding emission regions .",
    "sharp blue emission peaks in these lines match well those seen in the optical lines from the mmt spectrum ; specifically , the c  ii ] , [ o  ii ] and mg  ii emission peaks at 2297  , 2440  , and 2767   correspond to the @xmath44 km s@xmath0 peaks in the [ o  i ] 6300   and [ o  ii ] 7325    optical lines .",

    "this should be a reasonable estimate of the foreground extinction ( both galactic and in m100 ) for sn  1979c .",
    "however , it is larger than the previous total reddening value of @xmath52 estimated toward sn  1979c ( @xcite ) and may indicate that some weak [ ca  ii ] 7291,7330   emission contributes to the 7300   feature s strength .",
    "this would make the 2470/7325 ratio appear smaller and hence the reddening larger .",

    "one can also estimate the internal dust extinction in the young , developing remnant by comparing the red emission spikes in the [ o  ii ] 2470 and 7325 lines .",
    "the observed 2470/7325 ratio of 0.15 suggests e(b  v ) = @xmath53 implying an internal reddening of e(b  v ) = @xmath6 in addition to the foreground e(b  v ) of @xmath54 .",
    "although the evidence for internal extinction is strong due to the consistently weaker red emission spikes in the uv line profiles , our measurement is not very accurate from this single measurement .",
    "although the red emission peak is comparable or slightly stronger than the blue in the optical lines of [ o  i ] 6300,6364 and [ o  ii ] 7319,7330 , much greater variation in blue / red peak strengths is seen for the uv lines in the _ hst _ data .",
    "for example , the red emission peak in the [ o  ii ] 2470   line is about 45% as strong as the blue emission peak , around 65% in the c  ii ] 2324   line , and less than 35% for the mg  ii 2800   line .",
    "emission features detected between 3000 and 4600   in the short g400h exposure are considerably weaker and consequently have less certain identifications but appear to be [ ne iii ] 3869  , [ s  ii ] 4068,4076  , and [ o  iii ] 4363  .",
    "the strength of the temperature sensitive [ o  iii ] 4363 line is surprisingly large relative to the [ o  iii ] 4959,5007 lines and suggests electron densities @xmath55 10@xmath56 @xmath3 .",
    "the only other viable line identification for the 4335   emission is h@xmath28 .",
    "this seems unlikely , however , due to the weakness of the h@xmath1 emission .",
    "finally , our detection of [ s ii ] 4068,4076    is tentative but would be consistent with the sn  1980k spectrum .",
    "to date , five papers have been published on the late - time optical spectrum of sn  1980k plus one each on sn  1970 g , sn  1979c , and sn  1986e .",
    "none of these , however , presented spectra of sufficient s / n or covered a wide enough wavelength range to constrain several basic physical parameters such as densities or internal extinction , or test current late - time emission models .",
    "the new sn  1979c and sn  1980k spectra do provide some of this information and give a much clearer picture for late - time optical and uv properties of sne ii - l .",
    "in addition , because sn  1979c and sn  1980k were observed at comparable ages , they can be used to gauge the spread of sn ii - l late - time emission properties .",
    "table 1 lists the observed emission properties of four type ii - l sne having detected late - time optical emission .",
    "they can be seen to exhibit several spectral similarities . from @xmath11 8",
    "yr and extending at least to 17 yr , the strongest optical emission lines in sne",
    "ii - l are h@xmath1 , [ o  i ] 6300,6364 , [ o  ii ] 7319,7330 , and [ o  iii ] 4959,5007 .",
    "these lines show similar expansion velocities , @xmath11 5000  6000 km s@xmath0 , often with roughly equal line strengths .",
    "several of these lines also have emission profiles showing evidence for dust formation by virtue of diminished flux from the receding emission portions .",
    "the presence of this dust extinction creates both blueshifted line centers and asymmetric blue line profiles .",
    "in addition , all four sne show narrow emission lines ( e.g. , h@xmath1 and [ o  iii ] ) which could imply similar interstellar environments for the progenitors such as local h  ii regions .    however , significant spectral differences also exist .",
    "luminosities cover more than an order of magnitude , with a factor of six difference between objects of similar age ( e.g. , 79c and 80k ) .",
    "sn  1970 g and sn  1986e exhibit little if any broad [ o  iii ] emission , sn  1980k some , while in sn  1979c [ o  iii ] is stronger than h@xmath1 .",
    "conversely , sn  1980k has fairly strong [ fe  ii ] emission , both at 7155   and the blend at 51005300  , whereas sn  1979c and the other two do not .",
    "in addition , the very broad , unidentified emission near 5750   in sn  1979c is not seen in sn  1980k .",
    "bright optical emission appears correlated with the presence of strong late - time radio nonthermal emission and inferred high mass loss rates ( see table 1 ) in the sense that h@xmath1 luminosity tracks fairly well the peak 6 cm radio luminosity and the derived mass loss rate from late - time radio data .",
    "for example ,",
    "sn  1979c is the brightest radio and optical sn and has the largest estimated mass loss rate while sn  1970 g is optically the faintest with the lowest estimated mass loss rate .",
    "however , this correlation is not a particularly tight one .",
    "sn  1986e is nearly as bright optically as sn  1979c , yet it is quite faint in the radio .",
    "moreover , strong radio emission is also not always a predictor of bright optical emission .",
    "two of us ( fesen & filippenko ) have been unsuccessful in detecting late - time optical emission from sn  1968d in ngc 6946 ( the same parent galaxy as sn  1980k ) as a follow - up to its late - time radio emission recovery ( hyman et al .",
    "the lack of detectable optical emission may be related to sn  1968d s location closer to ngc  6946 s center and in a dustier region ( see @xcite and @xcite ) which may be attenuating faint , late - time optical emission below the detection threshold .",
    "late - time , optical emission lines from sne ii - l appear surprisingly steady over time spans of many years .",
    "our 1993 spectrum of sn  1979c indicated no decrease in h@xmath1 flux compared to 1990/1991 data ( fm93 ) and actually showed a slight increase as does a comparison of 1991/1998 [ o  i ] images .",
    "recent radio measurements indicate a flattening of its radio light curve ( van dyk et al .",
    "1998b ) and new optical measurements should be undertaken .",
    "sn  1980k s h@xmath1 flux remained nearly constant from 1987 through 1994 , decreasing only recently . in figure 7 , we show the h@xmath1 light curve over one decade : from 1987 through 1997 .",
    "the data indicate no change between 1987 and 1992.5 .",
    "spectra taken in 1991.4 and 1992.5 , though indicating possibly a slow fading , were of lower quality than one obtained in 1992.6 which indicated no significant drop in h@xmath1 strength ( fm94 ) . moreover , broadband photometric studies covering the years 1990  1992 indicated sn 1980k s optical flux level remained virtually unchanged from that seen in 1987 , especially in the r band which is sensitive to h@xmath1 emission ( r = 21.9 @xmath57 0.1 mag ; leibundgut et al .",
    "1993 ) .    a more recent spectrum taken in 1994 , however , showed an h@xmath1 emission flux of @xmath58 erg @xmath5 s@xmath0 ( fhm95 ) , about 25% less than the @xmath59 erg @xmath5 s@xmath0 found earlier .",
    "our 1997 measurement of @xmath60 erg @xmath5 s@xmath0 supports a fading h@xmath1 strength which may have started during the last several years , possibly in 1994 with the fhm95 reported decline . while this optical fading would roughly coincide with a drop in radio emission ( montes et al .",
    "1998 ) , we can not completely rule out a small , steady decline in h@xmath1 over the 19871997 period from the spectroscopic data .    during t = 10  20 yr ,",
    "sn  1980k s broad h@xmath1 line profile gradually narrowed , changing from a fwhm = 220   in 1988.6 to 190   in 1997.9 ( see fig .",
    "this trend has been noted earlier ( fm94 ) and is predicted by sn ",
    "csm interaction models ( cf94 ) . however , h@xmath1 appears to be the line most affected , with the [ o i ] 6300,6364 line profile changing little during this time interval .    with the notable exception of h@xmath1 , all the broad emission lines",
    "exhibit a spiky profile suggestive of clumpy emission regions at particular velocities .",
    "this is perhaps most clearly seen in sn  1979c where emission peaks at @xmath41 and @xmath61 km s@xmath0 can be seen in the [ o  i ] 6300 , [ o  ii ] 2470 , [ o  ii ] 7325 , c  ii ] 2324 , and mg  ii lines .",
    "the less blueshifted emission peaks are always weaker in the uv lines compared to the red or near infrared lines , consistent with the presence of internal extinction . in a similar fashion ,",
    "sn  1980k also exhibits strong emission peaks in the [ o  i ] 6300 and [ o  ii ] 7325 lines .",
    "the fact that the h@xmath1 profile in both sn  1979c and sn  1980k does not show such emission peaks suggests that the o , c , mg - rich emitting material is coming mostly from ejecta and is physically separate from the dominant h@xmath1 emitting material which includes the swept - up shell .",
    "our new spectra also allow one to get a handle on the electron density and temperature .",
    "in sn  1980k , we detected [ s  ii ] 4068,4076   lines but not [ s  ii ] 6716,6731   emission .",
    "the [ s  ii ] 4068,4072 lines have a critical density , n@xmath62 , of @xmath63 @xmath3 , whereas the 6731   line has n@xmath62 = @xmath64 @xmath3 .",
    "this suggests collision de - excitation of the [ s  ii ] 6716,6731 lines due to electron densities near 10@xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "an upper limit of @xmath11 10@xmath65 @xmath3 is suggested by the presence of strong [ o  i ] 6300,6364   emission ( n@xmath62 = @xmath66 @xmath3 ) and [ o  ii ] 7319,7330 (n@xmath62 = @xmath67",
    "@xmath3 ) , although [ o  i ] 6300,6364   emission can be strong even at high densities because it is an important coolant for low ionization gas . for example , [ o  i ] emission is an important for the cool shell in the cf94 models even though @xmath68 @xmath3 . if sn  1979c s densities were similar to those of sn  1980k , we would predict little [ o  ii ] 3726,3729   emission which has n@xmath62 = @xmath69 @xmath3 , and this agrees with observation .",
    "indeed , the fos spectrum of sn  1979c reveals strong [ o  ii ] 2470   emission but virtually no [ o  ii ] 3727   emission .",
    "as shown in table 2 , only those emission lines with critical densities above 10@xmath70 @xmath3 are detected in both 79c and 80k .",
    "consequently , we conclude that all lines with critical densities below 10@xmath70 @xmath3 are collisionally suppressed relative to lines having higher critical densities",
    ". electron densities of @xmath71 @xmath3 would also explain the observed low ratio of [ o  iii ] ( 4959 + 5007)/4363 .",
    "the [ o  iii ] 4959,5007   lines have n@xmath62 = @xmath72 @xmath3 . if the electron densities were a bit above @xmath73 @xmath3 , then the normally strong [ o  iii ] lines would be suppressed relative to [ o  iii ] 4363    line intensity ( n@xmath62 = @xmath74 10@xmath65 @xmath3 ) .",
    "furthermore , the [ o  iii ] electron temperature must be greater than @xmath11 15,000 k ( i.e. , i(4959 + 5007)/i(4363 ) @xmath7 4 assuming n = @xmath75 @xmath3 ) in order to generate sufficient 4363   emission to be detected given the s / n of the data .    a very broad emission feature seen in sn 1979c s spectrum near 5800   may be partially due to the temperature sensitive [ n  ii ] 5755 line .",
    "if correct , this would also indicate a [ n  ii ] temperature above 10@xmath76 k. the overall weaker [ o  iii ] emission seen in the sn  1980k spectrum might be due to low ejecta ionization as indicated by the presence of of strong [ fe  ii ] 50505400   and 7155   emission .",
    "late - time optical observations of sne ii - l can be used to test emission predictions in cf94 s recent sn  csm models . in table 1 , we list cf94 s predicted relative line intensities for t = 10 and 17.5 yr arising from sn  csm interactions assuming either a power law or red supergiant ( rsg ) density gradient .",
    "there is a general agreement with the observed line list , although there are significant differences with the relative line intensities .",
    "the observed line widths are approximately those expected and the general picture of emission from circumstellar interaction is supported , but cf94 present two detailed models that appear not to be well matched to the conditions in sn 1980k and sn 1979c .",
    "the models are based on the explosion of a @xmath77 red supergiant with two variations for the outer density profile .",
    "although not ideal , these models do provide a starting point for discussing the current observations .",
    "the rsg model predicts about the right h@xmath1 luminosity but weaker [ o  i ] and stronger [ o  iii ] ( relative to h@xmath1 ) than observed in all four cases . on the other hand , the 10 and 17.5 yr old power law models predict about the right h@xmath1/[o  i ] ratio , but less [ o  ii ] 7319,7330   emission , too much [ o  iii ] 4959,5007 , and much weaker h@xmath1 luminosity than observed .",
    "larger discrepancies between observations and models are seen for several uv lines .",
    "both rsg and power law models predict mg  ii 2800   to be the dominant uv / optical line ( after ly@xmath1 ) at a strength @xmath78 times more than h@xmath1 . however , the sn  1979c spectrum shows mg  ii to be slightly weaker than h@xmath1 , with the strongest line actually being c  ii ] 2324,2325 .",

    "other notable differences involve the [ o  ii ] lines .",
    "we find strong [ o  ii ] 7319,7330   emission in both sn  1979c and sn  1980k and suspect its presence in sn  1986e where it may have been mis - identified as [ ca  ii ] 7291,7330 ( @xcite ) . but [ o  ii ] 7319,7330   emission is weak in all cf94 models , due to the high excitation energy of the upper [ o  ii ] level and its small collision strength . because of this cf94 argued that [ ca  ii ] was the chief source of line emission observed near 7300  .",
    "however , in view of the new spectra , it now appears quite likely that the majority of the 7300   emission is due to [ o  ii ] .",
    "the presence of strong [ o  ii ] 2470 supports this conclusion .",
    "since cf94 do not predict a 2470   line strength we can not do a direct comparison . but based upon the theoretical [ o  ii ] 2470/7325 ratio of 0.78 , the model prediction should be about an order of magnitude too low .",
    "although [ o  ii ] 7319,7330   lines are weak in most photoionized nebulae , the presence of strong [ o  ii ] emission in young snrs is not uncommon . in almost all young , o - rich snrs such as cas",

    "strong [ o  ii ] emission has been successfully modeled by sutherland and dopita ( 1995 ) using a mixture of shock and photoionized emissions zones in o - rich ejecta .",
    "additional model - observation differences involve the the ca  ii ir triplet and the [ s iii ] 9069,9531   lines .",
    "these emission lines are predicted to be strong in the power law models but are not detected in the published near - ir spectrum of sn 1980k ( fhm95 ) .",

    "as noted above , the presence of strong [ o  iii ] 4363   emission indicates densities of @xmath79 @xmath3 .",
    "high oxygen gas densities would also account for the lack of any [ o  iii ] 4959 and 5007 line discrimination in the [ o  iii ] profile for sn  1979c . at densities above 10@xmath56 @xmath3",
