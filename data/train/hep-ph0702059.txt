    "in the years that have passed since neutrino oscillations were first observed at the super - kamiokande experiment in 1998 @xcite , there has been a remarkable experimental development in neutrino physics .",
    "for example , from the results of solar @xcite and long - baseline reactor @xcite neutrino experiments , we now know that the solution to the solar neutrino problem is given by the large mixing angle ( lma ) solution with @xmath5 ev@xmath6 and @xmath7 , and from atmospheric @xcite and accelerator @xcite neutrino experiments , we know that @xmath8 ev@xmath6 and that @xmath1 is close to maximal ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath9 ) .",
    "in addition , analyses of the @xmath10 binned super - kamiokande @xcite and kamland @xcite data even show the oscillatory behavior of the neutrino flavor conversion probability .",
    "the fact that neutrino oscillations occur implies that neutrinos have non - zero masses , which requires physics beyond the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) .",
    "thus , neutrino physics seems to be a viable window to explore physics beyond the sm .",
    "a feature of many extensions of the sm is the existence of non - standard interactions ( nsi ) ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) between neutrinos and other fermions , including the first generation fermions which make up most of the matter that we experience in everyday life . in particular ,",
    "effective four - fermion operators arising from such nsi will inevitably affect the dispersion relations for neutrinos propagating in matter through coherent forward scattering similar to that of the mikheyev  smirnov ",
    "wolfenstein ( msw ) effect @xcite , which is usually considered in neutrino oscillation analyses and responsible for the conversion of solar @xmath11 into @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "with new generations of neutrino oscillation experiments in the planning stages , we expect to probe the yet unknown parts of the parameter space for neutrino oscillations and to decrease the experimental uncertainty in the parts where we have only pinpointed certain regions . in such precision experiments , it may happen that even small contributions of nsi to the matter effects can play a role in distorting the measurements of the standard neutrino oscillation parameters or , more excitingly , that nsi can even be observed through the very same effects @xcite .",
    "the main injector neutrino oscillation search ( minos ) @xcite is an accelerator based neutrino oscillation experiment with a baseline of 750 km reaching from fermilab , illinois to the soudan mine , minnesota in the united states .",
    "it is an experiment designed to measure the neutrino oscillation parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 , but it may also improve the bound on the leptonic mixing angle @xmath2 . in this paper , we discuss the implications of including nsi in the analysis of the minos data .",
    "we focus on how the introduction of nsi affects the experimental bounds on the standard neutrino oscillation parameters , but also discuss what bounds minos itself could put on the parameters @xmath14 , which describe the nsi on a phenomenological level .",
    "non - standard interactions in the minos experiment have been previously studied by friedland and lunardini in ref .",
    "while they focus on constraints which are put by the combination of minos and atmospheric neutrino oscillation experiments , we focus on the constraints that can be inferred from the minos experiment alone . in particular , we consider the @xmath15 appearance channel and its implications for the leptonic mixing angle @xmath2 and the effective nsi parameter @xmath3 in detail .",
    "also in ref .",
    "@xcite , the effects of nsi on the @xmath11 appearance channel at minos were studied , focusing on the oscillation probability @xmath16 .",
    "one of the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite was that , in the most optimistic case , the oscillation probability will be so large that it can not be described by the standard neutrino oscillation scenario alone , and thus , implying the existence of nsi .",
    "our numerical simulations will show that @xmath17 ( which is above the current experimental bound ) would be needed to establish nsi unless further external constraints can be put on @xmath18 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nsioscillations ] , we introduce the framework of neutrino oscillations including the effects of nsi .",
    "section [ sec : analytic ] deals with analytic considerations for the neutrino oscillation channels relevant to the minos experiment , while sec .",
    "[ sec : numeric ] presents the results of our numerical treatment using the globes software @xcite . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] , we summarize our results and give our conclusions .",
    "in this paper , we will use the standard three - flavor neutrino oscillation framework with an effective vacuum hamiltonian given by @xmath19 in flavor basis . here",
    "@xmath20 is the neutrino energy , @xmath21 are the neutrino mass squared differences , @xmath22 is the leptonic mixing matrix @xcite @xmath23 @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 are the leptonic mixing angles , and @xmath27 is the _ cp_-violating dirac phase .",
    "in addition , the standard matter effect on neutrino oscillations is implemented through the effective contribution @xcite @xmath28 to the vacuum hamiltonian , where @xmath29 is the fermi constant and @xmath30 is the electron number density .",
    "we are interested in examining the effects of introducing nsi between neutrinos and other fermions that reduce to effective four - fermion interactions .",
    "these nsi can be described by a lagrangian density of the form @xmath31[\\overline f \\gamma_\\mu ( 1+a\\gamma_5 ) f],\\ ] ] where the @xmath32 give the strength of the nsi . in analogy with the msw effect , terms of this type",
    "will give an effective contribution to the neutrino oscillation hamiltonian , which will be of the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 @xmath35 is the number density of fermions of type @xmath36 , and we have assumed an unpolarized medium . for bounds on the parameters @xmath32 , see refs .",
    "generally , the nsi involving @xmath12 are quite well constrained , while the bounds on the other nsi ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath37 , @xmath3 , and @xmath38 ) are of order unity .",
    "thus , we will focus on nsi which do not involve @xmath12 interactions . in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we will work with the effective parameters @xmath14 , assuming them to be constant , which is a good approximation as long as the matter composition does not change significantly along the neutrino baseline .",
    "the full hamiltonian is then given by @xmath39 effects of this type have been previously studied in refs .",
    "in this section , we present some analytic considerations which are valid mainly for weak nsi . these will prove useful in understanding the numeric results in the next section .",
    "the main objective of the minos experiment is to measure the neutrino oscillation parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the neutrino oscillation channel used is the @xmath12 disappearance channel , which is sensitive to the @xmath12 survival probability @xmath40 .",
    "the leading terms in the expression for @xmath40 are @xmath41 where three - flavor effects due to @xmath42 and @xmath2 have been neglected .",
    "equation ( [ eq : pmm ] ) can be easily derived using the effective two - flavor hamiltonian of the @xmath12@xmath13 sector , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath43 for the base - line and matter potential relevant to the minos experiment , the off - diagonal nsi parameters will not be sufficient to introduce large transitions to @xmath11 , and therefore , the nsi can be effectively discussed in the same two - flavor framework , where their contribution to the effective neutrino oscillation hamiltonian is @xmath44 the stringent way of treating this situation is to introduce the parameter @xmath3 as a perturbation .",
    "it is then easy to show that the two - flavor approximation holds for @xmath45 , or @xmath46 in the case of the minos experiment .",
    "we note that neutrino oscillations with the effective hamiltonian @xmath47 are equivalent to standard two - flavor neutrino oscillations in matter with the substitutions @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , for which we know that the effective neutrino oscillation parameters are given by @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 ^ 2 + \\sin^2(2\\theta_{23})}.\\ ] ] thus , for a fixed energy @xmath20 , it is always possible to choose @xmath38 in such a way that @xmath53 , leading to @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , we expect , when including the effects of nsi , a degeneracy between the standard oscillation parameters @xmath0 and @xmath56 and the nsi parameter @xmath38 , _",
    "i.e. _ , if we measure @xmath57 and @xmath55 , then this could just as well be produced from a smaller mixing angle and larger mass squared difference by the effects of the nsi .",
    "the fact that different @xmath38 will be needed in order to reproduce this effect at different energies implies that this degeneracy can be somewhat resolved by studying the neutrino oscillation probability at different energies ( as in the case of an actual neutrino oscillation experiment measuring the neutrino energy , _",
    "e.g. _ , the minos experiment ) .",
    "however , if the energy range is not broad enough , then the degeneracy will still manifest itself in the form of an extension of the sensitivity contours when including nsi into the analysis . in fig .",
    "[ fig : analyticdisappearence ] , we show the neutrino survival probability @xmath40 as a function of energy @xmath20 for different choices of @xmath56 and @xmath0 which are on the nsi degeneracy .     as a function of the neutrino energy @xmath20 for different values of @xmath56 and @xmath58 on the nsi degeneracy involving @xmath38 ( only the value of @xmath56",
    "is displayed in the figure ) in the two - flavor scenario .",
    "the nsi parameter @xmath38 has been chosen in order for the effective parameters to coincide at @xmath59  gev .",
    "[ fig : analyticdisappearence],width=453 ]    note that this figure is only provided for illustrative purposes in order to show the degeneracy and that the values of @xmath38 needed for @xmath60 and 0.75 are relatively large ( about @xmath61 for @xmath60 ) .",
    "however , the degeneracy does not need to be exact in order to extend the sensitivity countours and also smaller values of @xmath38 will be enough for this purpose .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that , including the first - order correction in @xmath14 , the effective three - flavor mixing matrix element @xmath62 is given by ( to zeroth order in the ratio @xmath63 ) @xmath64 which is valid as long as the individual contributions remain small ( from the chooz bound @xcite @xmath65 is known to be small and the absolute value of the nsi contribution is of the order of @xmath66 for @xmath67 ) .",
    "as the oscillation probability @xmath16 is expected to be sensitive to the effective mixing angle @xmath68 , this will lead to an additional degeneracy between the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the effects of the other nsi parameters are suppressed by @xmath69 or @xmath70 .",
    "for our numeric simulations , we used the globes software @xcite which was extended in order to accommodate the inclusion of nsi .",
    "the abstract experiment definition language ( aedl ) files used to describe the minos experiment were modified versions of the minos aedl files provided in the globes distribution and they were based on refs .",
    "these aedl files correspond to a minos running time of five years with @xmath71 protons on target per year .",
    "the neutral- and charged - current cross - sections were taken from refs .  @xcite as provided by the globes distribution .",
    "the disappearance and appearance channels were simulated in a neutrino energy interval of 1 - 6  gev , since the majority of the neutrinos in the numi beam are in this range .",
    "for the simulations , the neutrino energy interval was binned into 30 equal bins .",
    "the matter density was assumed to be constant with a value corresponding to the matter density of the earth s crust , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath72  km@xmath73 .",
    "the simulated neutrino oscillation parameters are shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : real_values ] .",
    "the choices for @xmath58 and @xmath56 are inspired by the preliminary minos results @xcite , which are almost equivalent to the k2k results @xcite , and the simulated values of all nsi parameters are zero , in order to possibly obtain useful sensitivities for nsi detection . in all simulations , we have used the full numeric three - flavor framework and the parameters not presented in the figures ( including nsi parameters such as the phase of @xmath3 ) have been marginalized over unless stated otherwise .",
    "it should also be noted that normal mass hierarchy , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath74 , was assumed for the simulations shown .",
    "the results for inverted mass hierarchy are similar and no distinction can be made between the hierarchies .",
    "furthermore , @xmath75 and @xmath76 were kept fixed at the values given in tab .",
    "[ tab : real_values ] for the simulations , since minos is not sensitive to these parameters .",
    "in addition , the _",
    "cp_-violating phase @xmath27 was kept fixed for the simulations of the parameters governing the disappearance channel , since its effect in this channel is small .",
    "however , for the simulations of the parameters governing the appearance channel ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , we marginalize over @xmath27 , since it is important to include the effects of a possible relative phase between @xmath65 and @xmath3 . the explicit choice of @xmath77 for the simulated value of @xmath27 does not affect the results of our simulations significantly . in all figures , we show the combined results of the disappearance and appearance channels .",
    "furthermore , when the standard neutrino oscillation parameters are marginalized , then we assume 20  % external error ( 1@xmath78 ) for @xmath0 and @xmath1 and an external error of @xmath79 for @xmath2 ( corresponling roughly to the chooz bound ) .",
    ".the neutrino oscillation parameters used in the simulations . [ cols=\">,<,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the nsi parameters , we assume external errors in accordance with direct bounds @xcite and with the results of high - energy atmospheric neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "the high - energy sample of atmospheric @xmath12 events indicate that muon neutrinos oscillate also at higher energies . if the second eigenvalue @xmath80 of the matter interaction part of the full hamiltonian ( including both nsi and the standard matter effect ) is too large ( such that @xmath81 ) , then matter effects will entirely dominate the neutrino flavor propagation . since we have assumed @xmath82 , this would mean that muon neutrinos would be fully decoupled in contrast to experiments .",
    "the resulting constraint in the nsi parameter space has the shape of a parabola in the @xmath38@xmath4-plane as @xmath83 corresponds to @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "however , the study of high - energy events of different flavors ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) may provide further information such as the composition of the state which muon neutrinos oscillate into , which in turn will be related to the nsi parameters .",
    "the atmospheric constraints were implemented by setting a prior of @xmath85 for the second eigenvalue .",
    "the results are not particularly sensitive to the specific prior chosen .",

    "the reason why the contours do not extend to @xmath88 is based on the fact that the minos experiment is not using a single neutrino energy , but rather has a continuous energy spectrum . for a fixed @xmath38 , @xmath53",

    "we can also clearly observe the @xmath18@xmath4 degeneracy discussed in the previous section .",

    "the current chooz bound , the bound that could be put by the minos experiment is @xmath99 , which is not competitive with the current direct bounds on the specific nsi .",
    "if the @xmath18 bound is improved by an order of magnitude ( _ e.g. _ ,  by future reactor experiments @xcite ) , then the minos bound on @xmath4 could be improved to @xmath100 , which is still of the same order of magnitude as the direct nsi bounds .",
    "thus , it seems that in order to put constraints on nsi from neutrino oscillation experiments , we would need an experiment with better sensitivity than minos .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : s13-et ] , we show the results for @xmath92 ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "again , we can observe the degeneracy in the @xmath18@xmath4 plane along the direction of @xmath102 . in this case",
    ", minos will be able to tell us that @xmath62 is non - zero , but not whether this is the effect of non - zero @xmath2 or non - zero @xmath3 ( or a combination ) .",
    "because of this degeneracy , the result is very similar if considering non - zero @xmath3 while @xmath103 .",
    "when considering @xmath2 and @xmath3 which are simultaneously non - zero , the resulting sensitivity contours depend on the magnitude of the simulated @xmath62 [ _ e.g. _ , if the two terms in eq .",

    "the dashed curves correspond to an increased running time of 15 years , whereas the dotted curves correspond to five years of running time , but with external bounds which have been improved by a factor of four .",
    "the nsi parameter @xmath37 has been chosen along the parabola allowed by atmospheric neutrino experiments @xcite.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    as can be seen from this figure , the current situation is such that minos will not be sensitive to any of the nsi parameter values which are not already excluded ( the excluded regions are @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 in accordance with ref .",
    "@xcite ) . increasing the minos running time to 15 years",
    "does not improve significantly upon this result .",
    "however , if the external bounds on the standard neutrino oscillation parameters are improved by a factor of four , then minos will be able to detect @xmath4 of about one at a confidence level of 90  % .",
    "this is due to the improved bound on @xmath2 leading to a breaking of the @xmath18@xmath4 degeneracy .",
    "the improvement in the external bound on @xmath2 used in the figure corresponds to an upper limit of @xmath108 , which is slightly below the double chooz sensitivity limit @xcite ( note that the reactor neutrino experiments are not sensitive to nsi , since they operate at very low energies ) .",
    "the asymmetry of the figure with respect to @xmath109 is a result of how @xmath38 affects the effective @xmath62 .",
    "since we are not in the perturbative regime , we treat the case with @xmath103 exactly in @xmath38 and perturbatively in @xmath3 .",
    "the result of this is an equation similar to eq .",

    "the main influence on the nsi sensitivity is given by the appearance channel , with no or only a small contribution from the disappearance channel .",
    "with the advent of new precision measurements of the neutrino oscillation parameters , it is important that we understand the phenomenology of the physics that could affect these measurements and give rise to erroneous interpretations if not taken properly into account .",
    "in addition , putting constraints on such physics from neutrino oscillation experiments alone is also an intriguing idea . in this paper",
    ", we have studied the influence of including nsi into the analysis of the minos experiment by analytic arguments and by using the globes software in order to simulate how the sensitivity to the ordinary neutrino oscillation parameters is affected by the introduction of nsi .",
    "we have also studied the prospects of putting bounds on the effective nsi parameters directly from the minos data .",
    "our analytic results show that the disappearance channel ( @xmath110 oscillations ) is mainly affected by the effective nsi parameter @xmath38 , while the appearance channel ( @xmath111 ) is mainly sensitive to @xmath3 .",
    "the effect of including nsi into the analysis of the disappearance channel is that the sensitivity contours are extended to larger @xmath0 and lower @xmath56 by the introduction of a degeneracy due to @xmath38 as described in the analytic treatment .",
    "these analytic considerations are supported by our numerical simulations , which are performed using the full three - flavor framework .    in the numeric analysis of the appearance channel , the degeneracy between the leptonic mixing angle @xmath2 and the effective nsi parameter @xmath3 described in refs .",
    "@xcite introduces difficulties in placing bounds on either of these parameters unless a stringent bound for the other parameter is imposed by external measurements . with an external bound on @xmath4 of the order of @xmath112 , the minos experiment would be sensitive to values of @xmath18 down to about 0.07 , to be compared with the present bound of approximately 0.13 from the chooz experiment",
    "however , this sensitivity rapidly deteriorates with less stringent bounds on @xmath4 and the @xmath18 sensitivity for the nsi parameters , which are phenomenologically viable today , is clearly worse than the chooz bound . on the other hand , if external measurements show that @xmath113 , then the minos experiment should be able to place a bound on @xmath4 of the order of unity , which is of the same order as the present bounds from interaction experiments . with",
    "the current chooz bound , the bound that could be put on @xmath4 from the minos experiment is about a factor of 2.5 larger than this , even with an increased running time of 15 years . however",
    ", a signal in the minos appearance channel would indicate that either @xmath2 , @xmath3 , or both are non - zero as this would imply @xmath114 .",
    "it should also be noted that the results presented here do not depend on the neutrino mass hierarchy ( _ i.e. _ , if @xmath115 or @xmath116 ) , or whether or not we try to make a fit with the same mass hierarchy as the one used in the simulation .    in conclusion",
