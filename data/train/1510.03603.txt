    "when a fermion multiplicity ( flavor ) exceeds a critical value @xmath7 in non - abelian gauge theories , a quantum phase transition from a chiral broken phase to the conformal window is anticipated to take place . in the conformal window ,",
    "strong coupling gauge theories are asymptotically - free in ultra violet ( uv ) region , while dominated by a non - trivial infrared fixed point ( irfp ) in infrared ( ir ) region .",
    "the irfp - conformal dynamics can be probed via a response to a small fermion mass ( @xmath8 ) perturbation , which gives rise to a bound state with a mass gap ( @xmath9 ) satisfying the conformal hyperscaling relation with a mass anomalous dimension @xmath2 . in the chiral broken phase near to the conformal window @xmath10 , it is advocated that the system shows an approximate conformality ( walking ) with a `` would - be '' @xmath2 , which is of great interest in physics beyond the standard model @xcite . in recent lattice studies ,",
    "the precise determination of @xmath2 in many flavor qcd is reported , while there exist tensions among the values @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy presumably originates to scale violations by uv / ir cutoffs ( lattice spacing and finite box size ) as well as a probe fermion mass . in this proceedings ,",
    "we focus on the ir cutoff effects by using schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equation .",
    "we consider the sd equation for the fermion propagator @xmath11^{-1}$ ] within improved ladder approximation in the landau gauge . after integrating over angular degrees of freedom in a momentum space ,",
    "the sd equation is expressed as @xmath12\\alpha(p^{2}+q^{2})}{4\\pi } \\left [   \\frac{q^{2}}{p^{2}}\\theta_{p^{2 } - q^{2}}+\\theta_{q^{2}-p^{2}}\\right ]   \\frac{\\sigma(q^{2})}{q^{2}+\\sigma^{2}(q^{2 } ) } , \\label{sdeq}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 $ ] represent a bare fermion mass , step function , running coupling constant in the two - loop perturbation theory , and quadratic casimir operator , respectively .",
    "the uv / ir cutoffs @xmath16 are introduced in the momentum space integral . for a given fermion mass @xmath8 and in the presence of @xmath16 , we numerically solve the sd equation ( [ sdeq ] ) and evaluate the physical pole mass @xmath0 and pion decay constant @xmath1 as @xmath17 we take account of full momentum dependences of the two - loop running coupling without recourse to the usual step - function type approximation for the coupling .",
    "we then perform the hyperscaling fit analyses for the obtained numerical data similarly to analyses in lattice gauge theories .",
    "moreover , we derive the sd - based finite - size hyperscaling formula ( fss ) , which allows us to handle the ir cutoff artifacts , even in the case of @xmath18 .",

    "we shall now derive a sd - based fss which allows us to handle the ir cutoff artifacts explained above . to this end , we further approximate the sd equation ( [ sdeq ] ) with a linearized fermion propagator and @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the running coupling at irfp , and obtain the analytic expression of the renormalization factor @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath41 is a function of dimensionless variables , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , and the analytic expression allows us to derive the sd - based fss formula @xcite : @xmath46 the equation ( [ eq : fss0 ] ) is same as what dictated by the renormalization group equation @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the sd predicts another fss formula ( [ eq : fssir ] ) which is characterized by the scaling variable @xmath47 rather than @xmath48 for larger @xmath3 .",

    ", we adopt the ansatz ( [ eq : fss0 ] ) .",
    "the fit works well ( blue - solid line ) and we obtain @xmath50 which is fairly consistent to @xmath35 obtained in the previous section for the smallest ir cutoff @xmath51 .",

    "thus , the right fss formula in the right place recovers the approximate universality @xmath56 , or equivalently , the approximate data alignments in the whole mass region including both @xmath49 and @xmath53 .",
    "then , two scaling variables , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , are responsible for two slopes of the alignments . in lattice studies , indeed , the formula ( [ eq : fss0 ] ) is widely used in lattice study , but the formula ( [ eq : fssir ] ) is rarely used @xcite . however , these result are of the case without paying attention to the scope of application , and opposed to each other @xcite .",
