    "quantum cosmology is the application of quantum theory to the universe as a whole .",
    "since the dominating interaction in the cosmological realm ( on the largest scales ) is gravity the extrapolation of quantum theory to the whole universe immediately has to address the problem of quantizing the gravitational field ( e.g. @xcite ) . at first glance",
    "such an attempt seems surprising since one is used to apply quantum theory to microscopic systems .",
    "nevertheless one can put forward many arguments in favour of the quantization of gravity :    * _ unification _ ( as a logical necessity and to avoid inconsistences ) .",
    "all particles are the sources of the gravitational field .",
    "if their gravitational fields were really classical , then measuring all the components of these fields simultaneously it would be possible to determine the coordinates and velocities of the particles at once , so that uncertainty principle will be violated .",
    "since the gravitational field is coupled to all other fields , it would be appear strange , and even inconsistent , to have a drastically different framework for this one field . * _ singularity theorems of general relativity_. under very general conditions , the occurrence of a singularity ( where the theory breaks down ) is unavoidable . therefore a more fundamental theory is needed .",
    "it is expected that a quantum theory of gravity will be such a fundamental theory . * _ initial conditions in cosmology_. since the singularity theorems predict the existence of an initial state with infinite energy density which can not be described by general relativity , a quantum theory should supply a classical theory of gravity with appropriate initial conditions . *",
    "_ field - theory speculations_. it is believed that gravity can play the role of a regulator which can automatically eliminate the divergences in ordinary quantum field theory . *",
    "_ experiment - theory concordance_. a situation in theoretical physics is reflected in the diagram @xcite : @xmath0 in which the theoretical components are linked to the physical data . in the case of quantum gravity it was accepted that the data which can be unambiguously interpreted as a result of quantum effects are absent , so that the diagram is shortened @xmath1 this opinion originates from the fact that the planck length @xmath2 cm is extremely small and lies beyond the range of .",
    "but it should be noticed that quantum effects are not a priori restricted to certain scales .",
    "rather the process of decoherence @xcite through the environment can explain why quantum effects are negligible or important for the object under consideration .",
    "+ in the present contribution we show that the original diagram can be restored if one will consider the whole and take into consideration the new astrophysical data from supernovae type ia observations , cmb anisotropy measurements ( wmap and others ) , hst key project , which have tremendously increased in volume during the last decade .",
    "observations indicate that overwhelming majority ( about 96% ) of matter / energy in the universe is in unknown form .",
    "the observed mass of stars gives the following values @xmath3 @xmath4 for the density of visible ( optically bright ) baryons .",
    "observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) and abundances of the light elements in the universe suggest that the total density of baryons is about 4  % of the total energy density ( e.g. @xcite ) @xmath5 this value is one order greater than the observed mass of stars .",
    "it means that most of baryonic matter today is not contained in stars and is invisible ( dark ) .",
    "the cmb anisotropy measurements allow to determine the total energy density @xmath6 and the matter component @xmath7 .",
    "the recent data give the strong evidence that the present - day universe is spatially flat ( or very close to it ) : @xmath8 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , + @xcite , @xcite and the mean matter density equals about 30  % of the total energy density .",
    "the independent information about the mean matter density @xmath7 extracted from the high redshift supernovae ia data on the assumption that the universe is spatially flat gives the close values : @xmath9 the discrepancies between the matter density @xmath7 and the density of baryons @xmath10 on the one hand and the total energy density @xmath6 and the matter density @xmath7 on the other hand are signs that there must exist non - baryonic dark matter with the density @xmath11 and some mysterious cosmic substance ( so - called dark energy ) with the density @xmath12 the origin and composition of both dark matter and dark energy are unknown .",
    "dark matter manifests itself in the universe through the gravitational interaction .",
    "its presence allows to explain rotation curves for galaxies and large - scale structure of the universe in the models with standard assumption of adiabatic density perturbations .",
    "as regards dark energy it is worth mentioning that its expected properties are unusual .",
    "it is unobservable ( in no way could it be detected in galaxies ) and spatially homogeneous .",
    "the observed faintness of the type ia supernovae ( sne ) at the high redshift attracts cosmologists attention in connection with the hypothesis of an accelerating expansion of the present - day universe proposed for its explanation .",
    "such a conclusion assumes that dimming of the supernovae is hardly caused by physical phenomena non - related to overall expansion of the universe as a whole , such as unexpected luminosity evolution , effects of contaminant gray intergalactic dust , gravitational lensing , and others ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore it is supposed that matter component of energy density in the universe @xmath13 , which includes visible and invisible ( dark ) baryons and dark matter , varies with the expansion of the universe as @xmath14 ( that is it has practically vanishing pressure ) , where @xmath15 is a cosmological scale factor , @xmath16 while dark energy is described by the following equation of state @xmath17 parameter @xmath18 can be constant , as e.g. in the models with the cosmological constant ( @xmath19cdm - models ) , or may vary with time as in the rolling scalar field scenario ( models with quintessence ) .",
    "even if regarding baryon component one can assume that the pressure of baryons may be neglected due to their relative small amount in the universe , for dark matter ( whose nature and properties can be extracted only from its gravitational action on ordinary matter ) such a dependence on the scale factor may not hold in the universe taken as a whole ( in contrast to local manifestations , for example in large - scale structure formation ) . since the contribution from all baryons into the total energy density",
    "does not exceed 4  % the evolution of the universe as a whole is determined mainly by dark matter and dark energy .",
    "subject of this contribution is to demonstrate that the observed dimming of the supernovae at the high redshift can be considered as a manifestation of _ quantum effects _ at cosmological scales .",
    "just as in ordinary quantum nonrelativistic and relativistic theories one can assume that the problem of evolution and properties of the universe as a whole in quantum cosmology should be reduced to the solution of the functional partial differential equation determining the eigenvalues and the eigenstates of some hamiltonian - like operator ( in space of generalized variables , whose roles are played by the metric tensor components and matter fields ) .    for simplicity",
    "we restrict our study to the case of minimal coupling between geometry and the matter . considering that scalar fields play a fundamental role both in quantum field theory and in the cosmology of the early universe we assume that",
    ", originally , the universe is filled with matter in the form of a scalar field @xmath20 with some potential energy density @xmath21 .",
    "let us consider homogeneous and isotropic universe with positive spatial curvature .",

    "the hamiltonian @xmath29 is following @xmath30 \\equiv n\\ , { \\cal r } , \\label{2}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is a function that specifies the time - reference scale . here and",
    "below we use the modified planck units : @xmath32 @xmath33 the function @xmath34 plays the role of a lagrange multiplier , and the variation with respect to @xmath34 leads to the constraint equation @xmath35 the structure of the constraint is such that true dynamical degrees of freedom can not be singled out explicitly . in the model being considered , this difficulty is reflected in that the choice of the time variable is ambiguous ( so called problem of time ) . for the choice of the time coordinate to be unambiguous",
    ", the model must be supplemented with a coordinate condition .",
    "when the coordinate condition is added to the field equations , their solution can be found for chosen time variable .",
    "however , this method of removing ambiguities in specifying the time variable does not solve the problem of a quantum description .",
    "therefore we shall use another approach and remove the above ambiguity with the aid of a coordinate condition imposed prior to varying the action functional .",
    "the invariance of action is restored by parametrizing the action .",
    "this approach formally agrees with the procedure of transformation from the wheeler - dewitt equation to a functional schrdinger equation ( from the arnowitt , deser and misner to the kucha description ) widely discussed in literature ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we will choose the coordinate condition in the form @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the privileged time coordinate , and include it in the action functional with the aid of a lagrange multiplier @xmath38 @xmath39 , \\label{4}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 \\label{5}\\ ] ] is the new hamiltonian .",
    "the constraint equation reduces to the form @xmath41 parameter @xmath37 can be used as an independent variable for the description of the evolution of the universe .    in quantum theory",
    ", the constraint equation comes to be a constraint on the wave function that describes the universe filled with a scalar field and radiation .",
    "the time - dependent equation has a following form @xmath42 with a hamiltonian - like operator @xmath43 the wavefunction @xmath44 depends on the cosmological scale factor @xmath15 , scalar field @xmath20 , and time coordinate @xmath37 .",
    "one can introduce , at least formally , a positive definite scalar product @xmath45 and specify the norm of a state .",
    "this makes it possible to define a hilbert space of physical states and to construct quantum mechanics for model of the universe being considered .",

    "this function can be normalized and used in calculations of expectation values .",
    "such an approximation does not take into account exponentially small probability of tunneling through the barrier @xmath62 .",
    "it is valid for calculation of observed parameters within the lifetime of the universe , when the quasistationary states can be considered as stationary ones with @xmath75 .",
    "we shall assume that the average value of the scale factor @xmath94 in the state with large quantum numbers determines the scale factor of the universe in classical approximation .",
    "then the time - independent equation ( [ 10 ] ) can be reduced to the form of the first einstein - friedmann equation in terms of average values ( for details see @xcite ) @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the mean total energy density .",
    "the quantum state of the universe depends on the form and the value of the potential @xmath21 . just as in classical cosmology which uses a model of the slow - roll scalar field in quantum theory based on the time - independent equation ( [ 10 ] ) it makes sense to consider a scalar field @xmath20 which slowly evolves ( in comparison with a large increase of the average value of the scale factor @xmath94 ) into a vacuum - like state with zero energy density , @xmath97 , from some initial state @xmath98 with planck energy density , @xmath99 .",
    "the latter condition allows us to consider the evolution of the universe in time in classical sense .",
    "reaching the vacuum - like state @xmath100 the scalar field @xmath20 begins to oscillate about the equilibrium vacuum value due to the quantum fluctuations . here",
    "the potential @xmath21 of the scalar field can be well approximated by the potential of harmonic oscillator @xcite @xmath101 where @xmath102 .",

    "170 objects of the survey we have drawn only a few dozens of typical supernovae which allow to follow the general tendency .      we may conclude that our quantum model is entirely consistent with the data of observations .",
    "this conclusion agrees with the result of data processing by @xcite who demonstrate that the model with lower value of the contribution from dark energy in the form of cosmological constant ( the green line in figures 2 and 3 ) may be preferred .",
    "deviations of the coordinate distances @xmath151 from the logarithmic law ( [ 35 ] ) towards both larger and smaller distances for some supernovae can be explained by the local manifestations of quantum fluctuations of scale factor about its average value @xmath94 .",
    "such fluctuations arose in the planck epoch ( @xmath152 ) due to finite widths of quasistationary states .",

    "practically all supernovae fall within the shown limits .",
    "thus the observed faintness of the sne ia can in principle be explained by the logarithmic - law dependence of coordinate distance on redshift in generalized form ( [ 36 ] ) which takes into account the fluctuations of scale factor about its average value .",
    "these fluctuations can arise in the early universe and grow with time into observed deviations of the coordinate distances of separate supernovae at the high redshift .",
    "they produce accelerating or decelerating expansions of space subdomains containing such sources whereas the universe as a whole expands at a steady rate .",
    "one can come to a conclusion that the universe as a whole expands at a steady rate analyzing the information about the expansion rate extracted directly from the data on coordinate distances to supernovae and radio galaxies .    in figure 5",
    "the derived values of the dimensionless expansion rate @xmath158 obtained by @xcite are shown .",
    "the inaccuracy of measurements and uncertainties in data processing do not allow to take this plot as a final outcome , but only look at the global trends .",
    "these trends are supported by the results of our calculations drawn in figure 5 as an area between the red lines .      the proposed approach to the explanation",
    "of observed dimming of some sne ia may provoke objections in connection with the problem of large - scale structure formation in the universe , since the energy density @xmath113 in the form ( [ 30 ] ) can not ensure an existence of a growing mode of the density contrast @xmath159 ( see e.g. @xcite ) . as we have already mentioned above the density @xmath113 ( [ 30 ] )",
