    "in one - dimensional function theory there is a general philosophy which supposedly goes back to a.  bloch ( see e.g.  @xcite,@xcite ) : if @xmath0 is a sufficiently reasonable class of holomorphic maps or functions , then the following statements should be equivalent :    1 .",
    "every map in class @xmath0 defined on the complex line @xmath1 is constant .",
    "the set of all maps in class @xmath0 defined on the unit disk @xmath2 is a _",
    "normal family_.    ( a family of maps is called a `` normal family '' if every sequence in it is either compactly divergent or contains a subsequence which converges uniformly on compact sets .",
    "a sequence of maps @xmath3 between topological spaces is `` compactly divergent '' , if for every pair of compact subsets @xmath4 , @xmath5 there are only finitely many @xmath6 with @xmath7 . )    for example , every bounded holomorphic function on @xmath1 is constant by liouville s theorem and due to montel s theorem the family of all bounded holomorphic functions on @xmath8 is a normal family .",
    "thus the bloch principle is valid for the family @xmath0 of all bounded holomorphic functions with values in @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath9 be a complex manifold .",
    "it is called `` taut '' if the family of all holomorphic maps @xmath10 is a normal family .",
    "let us from now on assume that @xmath9 is compact . then being `` taut ''",
    "is easily seen to be equivalent with hyperbolicity in the sense of kobayashi .",
    "the theorem of brody ( see @xcite ) states that this is furthermore equivalent with the property that every holomorphic map from @xmath1 to @xmath9 is constant .",
    "in other words : brody s theorem states that the bloch principle hold for the class of holomorphic maps with values in a ( fixed ) compact complex manifold @xmath9 .",
    "now we may raise the question : what about holomorphic maps to a compact complex manifold fixing some given base points ? given a compact complex manifold @xmath9 and a point @xmath11 ,",
    "let us consider the following two statements :    * every holomorphic map @xmath12 with @xmath13 is constant .",
    "* the family of all holomorphic maps @xmath10 with @xmath13 is a normal family .",
    "are they equivalent ?    using the notion of the infinitesimal kobayashi - royden pseudometric",
    "as introduced in @xcite this can be reformulated into the following question : _ `` if the infinitesimal kobayashi - royden peusdometric on a compact complex manifold @xmath9 degenerates for some point @xmath11 , does this imply that there exists a holomorphic map @xmath12 with @xmath14 ? '' _    thanks to brody s theorem it is clear that there exists some non - constant holomorphic map @xmath12 if the kobayashi - royden pseudometric is degenerate at some point @xmath15 of @xmath9 .",
    "but it is not clear that @xmath16 can be chosen in such a way that @xmath15 is in the image or at least in the closure of the image .",
    "of course , at first it looks absurd that degeneracy of the kobayashi - royden pseudometric at one point @xmath15 should only imply the existence of a non - constant holomorphic map to some part of @xmath9 far away of @xmath15 and should not imply the existence of a non - constant map @xmath12 whose image comes close to @xmath15 .",
    "thus one is led to postulate    let @xmath17 be a compact complex manifold , @xmath18 .",
    "assume that the infinitesimal kobayashi - royden pseudometric is degenerate on @xmath19 .",
    "then there exists a non - constant holomorphic map @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath17 be a complex manifold equipped with a hermitian metric @xmath22 .",
    "for each holomorphic map @xmath20 and each point @xmath23 we may now calculate the norm of the derivatie @xmath24 at @xmath25 with respect to the euclidean metric on @xmath1 and @xmath22 on @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a class of holomorphic maps @xmath26 with bounded derivatives ( i.e.  for every @xmath27 there is a number @xmath28 such that the inequality @xmath29 holds for all @xmath23 ) .",
    "let @xmath20 be a non - constant map in this class @xmath0 . via @xmath30",
    "this map @xmath16 yields a non - normal family of maps @xmath31 .",
    "now let @xmath32 denote the set of those maps in @xmath0 for which the derivative ( calculated with respect to the euclidean metric on @xmath1 resp .",
    "@xmath8 and the hermitian metric on @xmath17 ) is bounded . for each of the @xmath6 defined above the derivative",
    "is clearly bounded , since @xmath8 is relatively compact in @xmath1 , and @xmath33 extends through the boundary .",
    "thus @xmath6 is a non - normal family in @xmath32 .",
    "if the bloch principle holds for @xmath32 , this implies the existence of a non - constant holomorphic map @xmath34 in @xmath0 .",
    "thus : _ if the bloch principle holds for @xmath32 , the existence of a non - constant holomorphic map @xmath16 in @xmath0 implies the existence of a non - constant holomorphic map @xmath35 in @xmath0 with the additional property that @xmath36 is bounded .",
    "_    brody s theorem implies that this is indeed true if , given a compact complex manifold @xmath17 , we consider the set @xmath0 of all holomorphic maps with values in @xmath17 .",
    "however , we will give an example of a compact complex manifold @xmath17 , an open subset @xmath37 and a point @xmath38 such that this property does not hold if @xmath0 is chosen as the family of all holomorphic maps @xmath16 with image contained in @xmath37 and @xmath21 .      the key method for proving a bloch principle is the following : let @xmath39 be a non - normal family .",
    "then we look for an increasing sequence of disk @xmath40 which exhausts @xmath1 ( i.e. @xmath41 ) and a sequence of holomorphic maps @xmath42 such that a subsequence of @xmath43 converges ( locally uniformly ) to a non - constant holomorphic map from @xmath1 to @xmath9 .    for the proof of his theorem brody used this idea , taking combinations of affine - linear maps with automorphisms of the disk for the @xmath44 .",
    "zalcman ( @xcite ) investigated other reparametrizations where the @xmath44 themselves are affin - linear maps , a concept which has the advantage that it can also be applied to harmonic maps .",

    "let @xmath46 denote the union of all translates of complex subtori of @xmath45 which are contained in @xmath17 .",
    "it is known that this union is either all of @xmath17 or a proper algebraic subvariety ( @xcite ) .    since @xmath45 is a compact complex torus",
    "there is a flat hermitian metric on @xmath45 induced by the euclidean metric on @xmath47 via @xmath48 . a holomorphic map @xmath49 has bounded derivative with respect to this metric if and only if it is induced by an affine - linear map from @xmath1 to @xmath47 .    from this",
    ", one can deduce that @xmath50 for every holomorphic map @xmath20 with bounded derivative . given the previous considerations about the bloch principle",
    ", it is thus natural to conjecture :    for every non - constant holomorphic map @xmath20 the image is contained in @xmath46 .",
    "the kobayashi - pseudodistance on @xmath17 is a distance outside @xmath46 .",
    "for example , this statement is a consequence of the more general conjecture viii.i.4 by s. lang in @xcite . in the context of classification theory",
    "the above statement has also be conjectured by f. campana ( @xcite,9.3 ) .    in the spirit of the analogue between diophantine geometry and entire holomorphic curves as pointed out by vojta @xcite , the conjecture above is also supported by the famous result of faltings ( @xcite ) with which he solved the mordell conjecture .",
    "this result states the following : if we assume that @xmath45 und @xmath17 are defined over a number field @xmath51 , then with only finitely many exceptions every @xmath51-rational point of @xmath17 is contained in @xmath46 .",
    "we construct an example of the following type : there is a compact complex manifold @xmath17 , equipped with some hermitian metric , an open subset @xmath37 and a point @xmath52 .",
    "there exists a non - constant holomorphic map @xmath53 with @xmath54 . via @xmath55",
    "this yields a non - normal family of holomorphic maps @xmath56 with bounded derivatives such that @xmath57 .",
    "but there is no non - constant holomorphic map @xmath53 with @xmath54 _ and bounded derivative_.",
    "we construct an example which shows that brody reparametrization sometimes necessarily changes the image of the curve .",

    "recall that brody s method , starting from any holomorphic map from @xmath1 to @xmath62 , yields a holomorphic map from @xmath1 to @xmath62 with bounded derivative .",
    "thus this examples provides a picture in which brody s method really changes the properties of @xmath66 fundamentally .    responding to some additional questions which may be asked , we prove a little bit more .",

    "we remark that this implies in particular that the infinitesimal kobayashi - royden pseudometric vanishes identically on @xmath61 .",
    "furthermore , it provides examples of holomorphic maps from @xmath1 into a compact complex torus with a rather `` bad ''   and thus a set with non - empty interior such that the complement has also non - empty interior .",
