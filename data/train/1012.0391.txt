    "it suffices to show that every differentiable simply - connected closed 3-manifold is homeomorphic to the 3-dimensional sphere @xmath14 as proving the claim for differentiable 3-manifolds proves it for all .",
    "as @xmath2 is simply - connected it is orientable , so we start by proving some lemmas for closed , orientable and differentiable 3-manifolds .",
    "we do not change the manifold @xmath2 in the proof but construct different morse functions on it .",
    "first we recall from a theorem of smale that it is possible to find a morse function which has only one critical point of index 0 and of index 3 . in lemma 2",
    "we show , that we can change the morse function in a closed tubular neighborhood of a path so , that in the new morse function critical point of index 2 are on a higher level .",
    "we say , that a 2-handle is moved up by changing the morse function . in a similar way we can construct a new morse function where a selected critical point of index 1 is on a lower level .",
    "we say , that a 1-handle is moved down by changing the morse function .",
    "the modification to the morse function for moving a 2-handle up or a 1-handle down requires changes only in a closed tubular neighborhood of a path .",
    "the modification changes morse levels in the way that is illustrated in figure 2 by showing a 2-dimensional section .",
    "the modification , given precisely in lemma 2 , is radially symmetric with respect to the y - axis in figure 2 .",
    "figure 2 .    by moving all 2-handles up and all 1-handles down we get to the situation where every critical point of index one is on a lower level than any critical point of index two .",
    "let the lowest level of a critical point @xmath25 of index 2 be @xmath21 and the highest level of a critical point of index 1 be @xmath65 .",
    "let @xmath60 satisfy @xmath66 .",
    "then @xmath60 is a regular level , that is , not a level where there are critical points .",
    "we show that @xmath67 and @xmath68 are both handlebodies .",
    "that is , 3-manifolds with a boundary obtained by attaching handles to a 3-ball .",
    "this is not automatically true , we must show that the manifolds do not contain embedded exotic homotopy balls , i.e. , 3-manifolds , which have the boundary @xmath69 and which are simply - connected but not homeomorphic to 3-balls .    in lemma 9 we show that inside @xmath70 and @xmath71 there are no exotic homotopy balls .",
    "this is so because if there is an exotic homotopy ball after the addition of a 1-handle , there already was an exotic homotopy ball before the addition of the 1-handle . figure 3 illustrates this : if the blackened part is a part of an exotic ball , then there already existed an exotic ball before adding the 1-handle because we can connect the parts also by a tube that does not go through the 1-handle .",
    "figure 3 .",
    "let us notice that this is only true for the level @xmath60 such that all 2-handles are above the level @xmath60 and all 1-handles are below the level @xmath60 .",
    "on other levels we can not conclude that there are no embedded exotic balls .",
    "we can not even conclude that both sides are handlebodies with possible embedded exotic homotopy balls , since they may have nontrivial fundamental groups .",
    "we can show these things only for the level @xmath60 . in order to show that @xmath70 does not contain exotic balls we use induction by adding 1-handles one by one and",
    "conclude that no exotic ball exists .",
    "we can show the same for @xmath71 by making a similar induction with the morse function @xmath28 .",
    "a heegaard split is a general way of expressing 3-manifolds by glueing two handlebodies at their boundaries .",
    "the genus @xmath0 of the split is the number of handles in the handlebodies . in lemma 10",
    "we show that we have a special kind of heegaard split @xmath70 , @xmath71 . there are homeomorphisms @xmath72 and @xmath73 such that @xmath74 and @xmath75 are handlebodies embedded in @xmath18 , and a boundary homeomorphism @xmath76",

    "standard noncontractible generators @xmath77 and contractible generators @xmath78 can be defined for @xmath79 .",
    "similarily , the loops @xmath80 , @xmath81 are standard generators for @xmath82 .",
    "figure 4 shows these generator loops .",
    "figure 4 .",
    "the boundary homeomorphism @xmath83 induced by a morse function has the property , that @xmath84 and @xmath85 map loops to loops .",
    "the following example for the genus @xmath86 shows another important thing .",
    "not all combinations of standard generators can be represented as loops but only as closed curves that have self - intersections .",
    "in particular , if a contractible generator wraps several times around , there is needed a noncontractible generator to provide a shift , or the curve is not a loop but has self - intersections . in figure 5",
    "a ) the surface of a torus @xmath87 is divided into four squares with side length 4 .",
    "there are identications in the horizontal boundaries @xmath88 and in the vertical boundaries @xmath89 making it a 2-dimensional torus .",
    "figure 5 .",
    "let us stretch the part above @xmath90 into a strip of length 16 and width 2 , stretch the part below @xmath90 into a strip of length 4 and width 2 and wrap the strip 5 times around a torus as in figure 5 b ) .",
    "a loop drawn in figure 5 a ) maps to a loop drawn in figure 5 b ) .",
    "notice , that we need the shift in figure 5 a ) .",
    "we can define the standard generators on the surface of the handlebody @xmath91 as follows : @xmath92 is the loop from @xmath93 to @xmath94 , and @xmath95 is the loop from @xmath96 to @xmath97 in figure 5 b ) , and we can define the standard generators on the surface of the other handlebody @xmath98 as follows : @xmath99 is the loop from @xmath100 to @xmath101 , and @xmath102 is the loop from @xmath103 to @xmath104 in figure 5 a ) . the loop drawn to figure 5 a ) is @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the offset the loop advances in each round , the necessary shift needed to make a loop .    instead of fundamental groups of @xmath91 and @xmath98",
    "we will consider the first homology groups @xmath107 and @xmath108 with integer coefficients .",
    "the boundary map @xmath109 induces a linear map between the homology groups .",
    "the first homology group is abelian , so the loop can be expressed more simply as @xmath110 as the group is abelian , we can also use the additive notation : @xmath111    clearly , we can use linear algebra for solving the generators @xmath95 and @xmath102 , and if the manifold is simply - connected , we will manage to solve @xmath95 and @xmath102 as linear combinations of @xmath92 and @xmath99 .",
    "however , this is not only linear algebra with rational coefficients but there are the properties that loops map to loops and not every closed curve can be modified to be a loop . with these two properties we manage to show in lemma 13 that a loop @xmath112 can be associated with a loop @xmath6 which is homotopic to it in @xmath74 and @xmath6 bounds an embedded disc in @xmath75 .",
    "there is a critical point of index 2 in this disc , which we will move down .",
    "what we want to do with this result is to reduce the genus of the heegaard split by canceling one 2-handle and 1-handle pair .",
    "then induction on the genus yields the result .",
    "the tricky thing is that in order to cancel a pair we should move a 2-handle down .",
    "the modification that is needed for the morse function in order to move a 2-handle down is the inverse modification to the one in figure 2 .",
    "the difficult part is that in order to move a 2-handle down ( or 1-handles up , which is the same thing for @xmath28 ) we need a closed cylinder neighborhood of a disc . in order to move a 2-handle up ( or 1-handles down , which is the same thing for @xmath28 ) we only needed a closed tubular neighborhood of a path .",
    "topologically these are the same and that is why the modification is the same , but while it is easy to find a 1-dimensional path which does not meet any critical points , it is not easy to find a large disc which is avoiding critical points .",
    "it is where we need the simply - connectedness of @xmath2 .",
    "we can of course find an embedded disc from @xmath71 that bounds any contractible loop on @xmath113 , but this loop has to be moved down to a low morse level .",
    "we have to find an embedded collar that has the same boundary as this embedded disc .",
    "if we get such a collar then we can construct a morse function where the critical point of index 2 is on a level just above the level of the lowest critical point of index 1 .",
    "we can try to push down a loop that is contractible in @xmath71 and see what happens .",
    "let us take the loop @xmath114 on @xmath59 and try to push it down by a family of loops @xmath115 parametrized by @xmath116 where @xmath117 at the beginning ,    we can move the loop @xmath115 towards the gradient of the morse function @xmath28 so that the morse level of @xmath22 decreases",
    ". thus , at each level @xmath116 holds @xmath118 . in the beginning the loop @xmath115 creates an embedded collar when @xmath116 decreases but if @xmath115 meets a critical point of index 1 there may happen several things - the loop may get knotted , get self - intersections , split , merge and so on .",
    "this creates a complicated situation , and we try to avoid hitting any critical points if possible .    in order to avoid critical points , we try to find a loop that goes around one 1-handle only in @xmath70 , so that the loop can be pushed down creating a collar that does not go through any other critical points .",
    "thus , we need a loop on @xmath91 that has only one noncontractible generator @xmath95 . if the genus @xmath86 this is of course true , but if @xmath119 we need to find a suitable loop in lemma 13 . by using linear algebra and the two properties that loops map to loops and not all closed curves can be represented as loops we find a suitable loop that has only one noncontractible generator @xmath95 .",
    "then we can push the collar down all the way without hitting critical points because meeting these critical points means going around a 1-handle that is created in a critical point .",
    "our collar goes around the 1-handle that is created on the first critical point of index 1 .",
    "we will not continue the collar to this level but stop just before the level on some regular level .",
    "thus , our collar avoids all critical points and stays as an embedded collar .",
    "the embedded collar formed by moving the loop @xmath115 down can be connected the the disc in order to form a larger disc .",
    "we take a closed cylinder neighborhood of the disc . inside the neighborhood we can the change of the morse function , using the inverse of the change in figure 2 , and move the 2-handle to a lower level .",
    "the change does not affect the morse function outside the neighborhood and will not change the levels of other critical points . in this way we can move the 2-handle to a so low level",
    "that the two first critical points after the 0-handle are a 1-handle and a 2-handle and the 2-handle is a disc contracting the 1-handle .",
    "together they make a 3-ball .",
    "we can replace the morse function by such a morse function where these two critical points do not appear at all . in lemma 14",
    "we show that this results to a reduction of the genus of the heegaard split , which proves by induction that there are no exotic homotopy 3-spheres .",

    "proceed as follows .",
    "consider figure 4 and notice that we could add any number of handles to the torus in the center of figure 4 .",
    "thus , we have the generator @xmath380 and a number of generators @xmath371 . take a loop where @xmath380 appears one time only and @xmath371 appears @xmath381 times where @xmath382 .",

    "this loop is mapped to a loop and because of 3 ) every nonzero @xmath377 after multiplying by @xmath130 is @xmath386 .",
    "it follows that the integer @xmath130 is @xmath386 .",
    "let @xmath2 and @xmath22 be as in lemma 10 and let @xmath2 have a heegaard split of genus @xmath0 induced by @xmath22 .",
