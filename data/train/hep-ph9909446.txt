    "both massive lepton - pair production , @xmath3 , and prompt real photon production , @xmath4 are valuable probes of short - distance behavior in hadron reactions .",
    "the two reactions supply critical information on parton momentum densities , in addition to the opportunities they offer for tests of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "spin - averaged parton momentum densities may be extracted from spin - averaged nucleon - nucleon reactions , and spin - dependent parton momentum densities from spin - dependent nucleon - nucleon reactions .",
    "an ambitious experimental program of measurements of spin - dependence in polarized proton - proton reactions will begin soon at brookhaven s relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) with kinematic coverage extending well into the regions of phase space in which perturbative quantum chromodynamics should yield reliable predictions .",
    "massive lepton - pair production , commonly referred to as the drell - yan process  @xcite , provided early confirmation of three colors and of the size of next - to - leading contributions to the cross section differential in the pair mass q. the mass and longitudinal momentum ( or rapidity ) dependences of the cross section ( integrated over the transverse momentum @xmath0 of the pair ) serve as laboratory for measurement of the _ antiquark _ momentum density , complementary to deep - inelastic lepton scattering from which one gains information of the sum of the quark and antiquark densities .",
    "inclusive prompt real photon production is a source of essential information on the _ gluon _ momentum density . at lowest order in perturbation theory",
    ", the reaction is dominated at large values of the transverse momentum @xmath5 of the produced photon by the  compton \" subprocess , @xmath6 .",
    "this dominance is preserved at higher orders , indicating that the experimental inclusive cross section differential in @xmath5 may be used to determine the density of gluons in the initial hadrons  @xcite .    in two previous papers  @xcite",
    ", we addressed the production of massive lepton - pairs as a function of the transverse momentum @xmath0 of the pair in unpolarized nucleon - nucleon reactions , @xmath7 , in the region where @xmath0 is greater than roughly half of the mass of the pair , @xmath2 .",
    "we demonstrated that the differential cross section in this region is dominated by subprocesses initiated by incident gluons .",
    "correspondingly , massive lepton - pair differential cross sections in unpolarized nucleon - nucleon reactions are a valuable , heretofore overlooked , independent source of constraints on the spin - averaged gluon density .    turning to longitudinally polarized proton - proton collisions in this paper , we study the potential advantages that the drell - yan process may offer for the determination of the spin - dependence of the gluon density . to be sure",
    ", the cross section for massive lepton - pair production is smaller than it is for prompt photon production .",
    "however , just as in the unpolarized case , massive lepton pair production is cleaner theoretically since long - range fragmentation contributions are absent as are the experimental and theoretical complications associated with isolation of the real photon .",
    "moreover , the dynamics of spin - dependence in hard - scattering processes is a sufficiently complex topic , and its understanding at an early stage in its development , that several defensible approaches for extracting polarized parton densities deserve to be pursued with the expectation that consistent results must emerge .",
    "there are notable similarities and differences in the theoretical analyses of massive lepton - pair production and prompt real photon production . at first - order in the strong coupling strength , @xmath8 , the compton subprocess and the annihilation subprocess @xmath9 supply the transverse momentum of the _",
    "directly _ produced prompt photons .",
    "identical subprocesses , with the real @xmath10 replaced by a virtual @xmath11 , are responsible at @xmath12 for the transverse momentum of massive lepton - pairs . an important distinction , however , is that fragmentation subprocesses play a very important role in prompt real photon production at collider energies . in these long - distance fragmentation subprocesses ,",
    "the photon emerges from the fragmentation of a final parton , e.g. , @xmath13 , followed by @xmath14 .",
    "the necessity to invoke phenomenological fragmentation functions and the infrared ambiguity  @xcite of the isolated cross section in next - to - leading order raise questions about the extent to which isolated prompt photon data may be used for fully quantitative determinations of the gluon density .",
    "it is desirable to investigate other physical processes for extraction of the gluon density that are free from these systematic uncertainties .",
    "fortunately , no isolation would seem necessary in the case of virtual photon production ( and subsequent decay into a pair of muons ) in typical collider or fixed target experiments .",
    "muons are observed only after they have penetrated a substantial hadron absorber .",
    "thus , any hadrons within a typical cone about the direction of the @xmath11 will have been stopped , and the massive lepton - pair signal will be entirely inclusive .",
    "another significant distinction between massive lepton - pair production and prompt real photon production is that interest in @xmath7 has been drawn most often to the domain in which the pair mass @xmath1 is relatively large , justifying a perturbative treatment based on a small value of @xmath15 and the neglect of inverse - power high - twist contributions ( except near the edges of phase space ) .",
    "the focus in prompt real photon production is directed to the region of large values of @xmath5 where @xmath16 is small .",
    "interest in the transverse momentum @xmath0 dependence of the massive lepton - pair production cross section has tended to be limited to small values of @xmath0 where the cross section is largest .",
    "fixed - order perturbation theory  @xcite is applicable for large @xmath0 , but it is inadequate at small @xmath0 , and all - orders resummation methods  @xcite have been developed to address the region @xmath17 .",
    "as long as @xmath0 is large , the perturbative requirement of small @xmath18 can be satisfied without a large value of @xmath1 .",
    "we therefore explore and advocate the potential advantages of studies of @xmath19 as a function of @xmath0 for modest values of @xmath1 , @xmath20 to 3 gev , below the range of the traditional drell - yan region .",
    "there are various backgrounds with which to contend at small @xmath1 such as the contributions to the event rate from prompt decays of heavy flavors , e.g. , @xmath21 .",
    "these heavy flavor contributions may be estimated by direct computation  @xcite and/or bounded through experimental measurement of the like - sign - lepton distributions .    in sec .",
    "ii , we review perturbative qcd calculations of the transverse momentum distribution for massive lepton - pair production in the case in which the initial nucleon spins are polarized as well as in the spin - average case . in sec .",
    "iii , we present next - to - leading order predictions for the transverse momentum dependence of the cross sections for massive lepton - pair and real prompt photon production in unpolarized proton - proton collisions at energies typical of the rhic collider .",
    "predictions for spin dependence are provided in sec .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "in inclusive hadron interactions at collider energies , @xmath22 with @xmath23 , lepton pair production proceeds through partonic hard - scattering processes involving initial - state light quarks @xmath24 and gluons @xmath25 . in lowest - order qcd , at @xmath26 , the only partonic subprocess is @xmath27 . at @xmath12 , both @xmath28 and @xmath29 participate , with the recoil of the final parton balancing the transverse momentum of the lepton - pair .",

    "while the full next - to - leading order qcd calculation exists for massive lepton - pair production in the case of unpolarized initial nucleons , only a partial calculation is available in the polarized case  @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , we present spin - averaged differential cross sections at next - to - leading order , but we calculate spin asymmetries at leading order .",
    "spin asymmetries are obtained by dividing the spin - dependent differential cross section by its spin - averaged counterpart . for prompt photon production , comparisons of asymmetries computed at next - to - leading order with those at leading order show only modest differences  @xcite , whereas the cross sections themselves are affected more significantly .",

    "the maximum value @xmath116 7.5 gev attainable at @xmath117 gev argues for a larger @xmath115 .",
    "it is instructive to compare our results with those expected for prompt real photon production . in fig .  6 , we present the predicted differential cross section for prompt photon production for three center - of - mass energies .",
    "we display the result with full fragmentation taken into consideration ( upper line ) and with no fragmentation contributions included ( lower line ) . comparing the magnitudes of the prompt photon and massive lepton pair production cross sections in figs .  5 and  6 , we note that the inclusive prompt photon cross section is a factor of 1000 to 4000 greater than the massive lepton - pair cross section integrated over the mass interval 2.0 @xmath111 3.0 gev , depending on the value of @xmath0 .",
    "this factor is attributable in large measure to the factor @xmath118 associated with the decay of the virtual photon to @xmath119 .",

    "the significantly smaller cross section in the case of massive lepton - pair production means that the reach in @xmath112 is restricted to about a factor of two to three less , depending on @xmath115 and @xmath1 , than that potentially accessible with prompt photons in the same sample of data .",
    "nevertheless , it is valuable to be able to investigate the gluon density with a process that has reduced experimental and theoretical systematic uncertainties from those of the prompt photon case .    in our previous papers",
    "@xcite we compared our spin - averaged cross sections with available fixed - target and collider data on massive lepton - pair production at large values of @xmath0 , and we were able to establish that fixed - order perturbative calculations , without resummation , should be reliable for @xmath2 .",
    "the region of small @xmath0 and the matching region of intermediate @xmath0 are complicated by some level of phenomenological ambiguity . within the resummation approach , phenomenological non - perturbative functions play a key role in fixing the shape of the @xmath0 spectrum at very small @xmath0 , and matching methods in the intermediate region are hardly unique .",
    "for the goals we have in mind , it would appear best to restrict attention to the region @xmath122 .",
    "given theoretical expressions derived in sec .",
    "ii that relate the spin - dependent cross section at the hadron level to spin - dependent partonic hard - scattering matrix elements and polarized parton densities , we must adopt models for spin - dependent parton densities in order to obtain illustrative numerical expectations .",
    "for the spin - dependent densities that we need , we use the three different parametrizations suggested by gehrmann and stirling ( gs )  @xcite .",
    "we have verified that the positivity requirement @xmath123 is satisfied .    the current deep inelastic scattering data",
    "do not constrain the polarized gluon density tightly , and most groups present more than one plausible parametrization . gehrmann and",
    "stirling  @xcite present three such parametrizations , labelled gsa , gsb , and gsc .",
    "in the gsa and gsb sets , @xmath124 is positive for all @xmath125 , whereas in the gsc set @xmath126 changes sign .",
    "after evolution to @xmath127 gev@xmath128 , @xmath129 remains positive for essentially all @xmath125 in all three sets , but its magnitude is small in the gsb and gsc sets .    in this section , we present two - spin longitudinal asymmetries for massive lepton - pair production as a function of transverse momentum .",
    "results are displayed for @xmath130 collisions at the center - of - mass energies @xmath131 50 , 200 , and 500 gev typical of the brookhaven rhic collider .    in figs .",
    "8(a - c ) , we present the two - spin longitudinal asymmetries , @xmath87 , as a function of @xmath0 . as noted earlier , these asymmetries are computed in leading - order .",
    "more specifically , we use leading - order partonic subprocess cross sections @xmath132 and @xmath133 with next - to - leading order spin - averaged and spin - dependent parton densities and a two - loop expression for @xmath8 . the choice of a leading - order expression for @xmath133 is required because the full next - to - leading order derivation of @xmath133 has not been completed for massive lepton - pair production .",
    "experience with prompt photon production indicates that the leading - order and next - to - leading order results for the asymmetry are similar so long as both are dominated by the @xmath103 subprocess .",
    "results are shown for three choices of the polarized gluon density .",
    "the asymmetry becomes sizable for large enough @xmath0 for the gsa and gsb parton sets but not in the gsc case .",
    "comparing the three figures , we note that @xmath87 is nearly independent of the pair mass @xmath1 as long as @xmath0 is not too small",
    ". this feature should be helpful for the accumulation of statistics ; small bin - widths in mass are not necessary , but the @xmath104 and @xmath134 resonance regions should be excluded .",
    "as noted above the @xmath103 subprocess dominates the _ spin - averaged _ cross section .",
    "it is interesting and important to inquire whether this dominance persists in the spin - dependent situation . in figs .  9 and 10",
    ", we compare the contribution to the asymmetry from the polarized @xmath103 subprocess with the complete answer for all three sets of parton densities .",
    "the @xmath103 contribution is more positive than the full answer for values of @xmath0 that are not too small ; the full answer is reduced by the negative contribution from the @xmath135 subprocess for which the parton - level asymmetry @xmath136 . at small @xmath0 , the net asymmetry may be driven negative by the @xmath135 contribution , and based on our experience with other calculations  @xcite , from processes such as @xmath137 that contribute in next - to - leading order .",
    "for the gsa and gsb sets , we see that once it becomes sizable ( e.g. , 5% or more ) , the total asymmetry from all subprocesses is dominated by the large contribution from the @xmath103 subprocess .    as a general rule in studies of polarization phenomena",
    ", many subprocesses can contribute small and conflicting asymmetries .",
    "asymmetries are readily interpretable only in situations where the basic dynamics is dominated by one major subprocess and the overall asymmetry is sufficiently large . in the case of massive lepton - pair production that is the topic of this paper ,",
    "when the overall asymmetry @xmath87 itself is small , the contribution from the @xmath103 subprocess can not be said to dominate the answer . however , if a large asymmetry is measured , similar to that expected in the gsa case at the larger values of @xmath0 , figs .  9 and 10",
    "show that the answer is dominated by the @xmath103 contribution , and data will serve to constrain @xmath129 . if @xmath129 is small and a small asymmetry is measured , such as for the gsc parton set , or at small @xmath0 for all parton sets , one will not be able to conclude which of the subprocesses is principally responsible , and no information could be adduced about @xmath129 , except that it is small .    in figs .",

    "<S> we calculate the transverse momentum distribution for the production of massive lepton - pairs in longitudinally polarized proton - proton reactions at collider energies within the context of perturbative quantum chromodynamics . for values of the transverse momentum </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 greater than roughly half the pair mass @xmath1 , @xmath2 , we show that the differential cross section is dominated by subprocesses initiated by incident gluons , provided that the polarized gluon density is not too small . </S>",
    "<S> massive lepton - pair differential cross sections should be a good source of independent constraints on the polarized gluon density , free from the experimental and theoretical complications of photon isolation that beset studies of prompt photon production . </S>",
    "<S> we provide predictions for the spin - averaged and spin - dependent differential cross sections as a function of @xmath0 at energies relevant for the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven , and we compare these with predictions for real prompt photon production . </S>"
