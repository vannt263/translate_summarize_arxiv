    "observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) have confirmed a now ` standard ' cosmological model @xcite .",

    "the non - gaussianity is parametrized in these models by a non - gaussian amplitude @xmath0 to be defined more precisely below .",

    "however , @xmath46 , the coefficient of the second term in the expansion  that obtained from measurement of the kurtosis  can be obtained with the variance given above .",
    "thus , in this case , estimation of @xmath46 via measurement of the kurtosis , provides a more sensitive probe of a departure from the null hypothesis @xmath13 than does estimation of @xmath12 from measurement of the skewness , as long as @xmath54 .",
    "note that the cramer - rao bound is not violated in this case , as measurement of @xmath46 , which does not discriminate between positive and negative values of @xmath12 , does not provide any further information on @xmath55 .",
    "the _ apparent _ violation of the cramer - rao bound arises in this case because one of the conditions for the validity of the cramer - rao bound  that @xmath56 be non - zero at @xmath13 ( under the null hypothesis)is becoming invalid as the numerical coefficient of @xmath12 in @xmath57 is made smaller . had we chosen that coefficient to be zero , rather than @xmath58 , then the cramer - rao inequality would have given a nonsensical bound for @xmath55 .",

    "care must be taken in interpreting results of measurement of @xmath46 from @xmath62 , to note that the distribution of the @xmath62 estimator for @xmath46 is gaussian in @xmath46 , not @xmath12 .",

    "the correlation between the bispectrum and trispectrum estimators should thus decrease as the number of @xmath116 modes increases in the same way that the means @xmath166 and @xmath167 measured with a large number @xmath3 of data points @xmath168 will become uncorrelated as @xmath3 becomes large .",
    "of course since @xmath169 is linear in @xmath123 , the covariance between @xmath169 and @xmath158 will be zero .",
    "however , the correlation between @xmath170 and @xmath158 will be nonzero .",

    "some other useful relations include , @xmath176 @xmath177 @xmath178 @xmath179 also , since @xmath180 is a sum over ( approximately ) gaussian random variables , it is also well approximated by a gaussian random variable , and so @xmath181 .    from these relations",
    ", it follows that @xmath182,\\ ] ] and thus that @xmath183^{-1}. \\label{eqn : cccoeff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , if @xmath157 is small , then the correlation will be large .",
    "however , the correlation coefficient decreases as @xmath184^{-1}$ ] , and it will become negligible in the limit that @xmath157 is large .    strictly speaking ,",
    "the @xmath160 are not entirely statistically independent , as we have assumed here , as many are constructed from the same measurements .",
    "they are also not perfectly gaussian , as we have assumed .",
    "however , as we discuss in appendix [ sec : appendixb ] , we have checked with a full numerical calculation of the correlation coefficient that the basic conclusions  and particularly the scaling of the correlation coefficient @xmath185 with @xmath157are sound .",
    "a large body of recent work has focused on tests of the local model for non - gaussianity that can be performed with measurement of the cmb trispectrum and bispectrum .",
    "here we have clarified how the bispectrum and trispectrum may provide statistically independent information on the local - model non - gaussianity parameter @xmath0 , even if the bispectrum estimator for @xmath0 saturates the cramer - rao bound .",
    "the basic point is that the cramer - rao inequality puts a lower limit to the variance with which a given parameter can be measured .",
    "if the likelihood function is precisely gaussian , then the likelihood is described entirely by the variance . however , if the likelihood function is not precisely gaussian , then there is more information in the likelihood beyond the variance ( see , e.g. , section vi in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the current problem",
    ", this is manifest in that a statistically - independent measurement of @xmath4 can be obtained from the trispectrum without contributing to the variance of @xmath0 .",
    "we then built on an observation of ref .",
    "@xcite to illustrate the nature of the correlation between the bispectrum estimator for @xmath0 and the trispectrum estimator of @xmath4 .",
    "this analysis demonstrates that the two estimators do indeed become statistically independent in the large-@xmath70 limit .    throughout",
    "we have made the null hypothesis @xmath65 to estimate the variances with which @xmath0 can be measured from the bispectrum and with which @xmath4 can be measured from the trispectrum .",
    "this is suitable if one is simply searching the data for departures from the null hypothesis .",
    "however , as emphasized by ref .",
    "@xcite , the minimum - variance estimators constructed under the null hypothesis are no longer optimal if there is a strong signal .",
    "if so , then forecasts of signal - to - noise made with the null hypothesis are no longer valid in the limit of large signal - to - noise , and this calls into question claims @xcite that the trispectrum will provide a better probe of the local model in the large - s / n limit . in this limit , a new bispectrum estimator can be constructed to saturate the cramer - rao bound @xcite , and an analogous optimal trispectrum estimator can in principle be found .",
    "still , the observation that the bispectrum and trispectrum estimators in the local model are constructed from the same sums of triangles suggests that the precisions with which @xmath0 can be measured , in the high - s / n limit , from the bispectrum and trispectrum will be roughly comparable .    although we assumed the null hypothesis to argue that the bispectrum and trispectrum estimators for @xmath0 are independent , the same arguments should also apply in the high - s / n limit .",
    "for example , if the bispectrum estimator finds @xmath0 to be different from zero , with best - fit value @xmath186 , then the likelihood can be re - parametrized in terms of a quantity @xmath187 that quantifies the departure from the new null hypothesis @xmath188 .",
    "measurement of @xmath12 with the trispectrum can then be used to provide a statistically independent consistency check of the model . or , in simpler terms , the skewness and kurtosis are still two statistically independent quantities that can be obtained from a measured distribution , even if the skewness ( or kurtosis ) of that distribution is nonzero .    throughout , we have made approximations and simplifications to make the basic conceptual points clear , and we have restricted our attention simply to the local model , which we have here defined to be @xmath189 .",
    "however , inflationary models predict a wider range of trispectra @xcite .",
    "likewise , analysis of real data will introduce a number of ingredients that we have excised from our simplified analysis .",
    "still , we hope that the points we have made here may assist in the interpretation and understanding of experimental results and perhaps elucidate statistical tests of other , more general , non - gaussian models .",
    "mk thanks the support of the miller institute for basic research in science and the hospitality of the department of physics at the university of california , berkeley where part of this work was completed .",
    "mk was supported at caltech by doe de - fg03 - 92-er40701 , nasa nnx10ad04 g , and the gordon and betty moore foundation .",
    "in this paper we have chosen to work with discrete fourier transforms where the calculations of variances and covariances are more straightforward . here",
    "we show how to derive the expressions for power spectra , bispectra , and trispectra for this discrete formalism to the continuum analysis discussed in most of the theoretical literature .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , we note that @xmath190 where @xmath191 is the area of sky ( in steradians ) surveyed , from which we infer the correspondence @xmath192 .",
    "likewise , @xmath193 from which we infer the correspondence @xmath194 .",
    "the dirac delta function is then written in the discrete formalism as a kronecker delta as follows : @xmath195 the definitions in section  [ sec : definitions ] of the power spectrum , bispectrum , and trispectrum follow from this relation .",
    "one advantage of this formulation is that equations can be checked for consistency using dimensional analysis . recalling that @xmath196 has units @xmath197=$]sterad and that temperature has units @xmath198$]=k , it follows , for example , that @xmath199=$]k - sterad , @xmath200 = $ ] k@xmath201-sterad , @xmath202=$]k@xmath203 , @xmath204=$]k@xmath205-sterad@xmath201 , and @xmath206=$]k@xmath207-sterad@xmath205 . as another check , the variance and covariances should have an appropriate scaling with @xmath208 if factors of @xmath209 are carried properly through the calculation .",
    "as discussed in the text , the minimum - variance bispectrum and trispectrum estimators for @xmath96 are given by @xmath210 where @xmath211 are the variances of the bispectrum and trispectrum estimator .",
    "here we sum over all triangles and quadrilaterals ( not just those with no equal sides ) , and the factors of @xmath212 and @xmath213 take into account double counting of degenerate terms in the sum and permutation factors for triangles and quadrilaterals with equal sides . in sec .",
    "[ sec : crosscorrelation ] we used the squeezed - limit approximation to estimate the correlation coefficient between @xmath214 and @xmath158 . in this appendix we derive the full expression for this correlation coefficient and verify that the approximations made in sec .",
    "[ sec : crosscorrelation ] are valid .",
    "the covariance will consist of a weighted sum of the 10-point function .",
    "however , because of the fact that no two indices in the trispectrum or each bispectrum estimator can add to zero we know that two of the bispectrum indices must combine . the rest of the covariance will then be diagonal leading to @xmath215    finally , we need to compute the variance of @xmath216 . to do this",
    "we must compute the 12-point function @xmath217 where all temperatures within each group of three separated by a ` @xmath218 ' have zero covariance .",
    "the variance takes the form @xmath219 where @xmath220 numerically evaluating the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : varbsq ] ) shows that for @xmath221 the second ( non - gaussian ) term contributes less than 1% to the variance of @xmath216 .",
    "we have moreover numerically evaluated the exact expression for the correlation coefficient and verified that , as our estimates indicate , the correlation is of order @xmath222 for @xmath223 and @xmath221 .",
