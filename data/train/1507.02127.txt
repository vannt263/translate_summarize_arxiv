    "the present article proposes a theory that predicts the formation of habit plane normals very close to @xmath0 , observed in steels with low carbon content ( less than @xmath1 @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , _ all _ the predicted habit plane normals are almost exactly with @xmath2 and + @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes the euclidean distance . ] @xmath5 . widely accepted models that result in @xmath0 habit planes are double shear theories , e.g. @xcite , and some of the most accurate explanations are due to the algorithm developed by kelly @xcite .",
    "these can be seen as generalisations of the so - called phenomenological theory of martensite most notably developed by wechsler , liebermann & read @xcite to explain the @xmath6 habit planes in plate martensite and bowles & mackenzie @xcite who applied their theory to explain the @xmath7 and @xmath8 habit planes also in plate martensite .",
    "a short - coming of single / double shear theories is the lack of a selection mechanism that picks the right lattice invariant shearing systems ( see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 1 ) ) , in turn leading to a large number of input parameters . to overcome this ,",
    "one approach is to only allow shearing systems that arise from mechanical twinning , cf .  . indeed , in the context of single shear theories @xcite and @xcite made this assumption and proposed that the martensite plates consist of a _",
    "`` stack of twin - related laths''_. as pointed out in @xcite , tem investigations in @xcite showed that even though _ `` under the optical microscope there is little sign that this is the case , when such steels are examined with the transmission electron microscope , arrays of very thin @xmath9 twins are indeed found '' _ - marking a significant success from a theoretical prediction to an observed feature in plate martensite .",
    "regarding @xmath0 habit planes in lath martensite , it can be shown that for any reasonable choice of lattice parameters ( see also figure  [ figsimplnormals ] ) , a single shear theory with shearing systems arising from twinning in bcc crystals can not give rise to them .",
    "however , in this paper we show that by introducing another level of twinning ( `` twins within twins '' ) we are not only able to explain @xmath10 habit planes but also predict them by showing that it is the only possible family of habit planes that satisfies a condition of maximal compatibility and a condition of small overall atomic movement . under this interpretation",
    "each lath may be seen as a region of twins within twins . in other materials , twins within twins",
    "have commonly been observed purely in martensite @xcite as well as along interfaces with austenite @xcite .",
    "moreover for lath martensite it has been observed in @xcite that _ `` twinning within a lath may be heavy . in any event , whenever an exact twin relationship was identified , it was found to be a result of twinning within a given lath and not of a twin relation between adjacent laths .",
    "it is believed that the existence of heavily twinned local regions of laths , which may appear as separate laths in contrast images , may have caused some misinterpretation in earlier work on lath martensite . '' _    as in single shear theories , twinning of twins is macroscopically equivalent to a simple shear of a simply twinned system ( cf .",
    "text below ) and thus the step from twins within twins is in analogy with the step from a single to a double shear theory .",
    "the strength of the theory presented here is that it enables one to predict @xmath0 habit planes only assuming the lattice parameters of austenite and martensite .",
    "this is particularly striking when compared to the double shear theory in @xcite where the _ `` calculation strategy was to select one of the possible @xmath11 systems and then perform calculations for the @xmath12 systems over a range of values of @xmath13 .",
    "the sign of @xmath13 was selected by trial and error depending on whether the habit plane moved towards or away from @xmath0 . '' _",
    "the theory proposed in this article is derived from the ball - james model @xcite - based on nonlinear elasticity and energy minimisation - and expands on previous work by ball & carstensen @xcite on the possibility of nonclassical austenite - martensite interfaces .",
    "even though lath martensite is commonly associated with a high dislocation density , slip and plasticity the present model does not take such effects into account ( see also section [ secconcl ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the ball - james model recovers the results of the phenomenological theory of martensite , as can be seen through a comparison of the derived formulae for the habit planes between twinned martensite and austenite ( cf .",
    "* eq . ( 5.89 ) ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 33)-(34 ) ) ) .",
    "for a self - contained account of the phenomenological theory or of the ball - james model the reader is referred to the monographs @xcite and @xcite , respectively , both addressed to non - specialists .    in the ball - james model , which neglects interfacial energy ,",
    "microstructures are identified through minimising sequences @xmath14 , @xmath15 , for a total free energy of the form @xmath16 here , @xmath17 is a region representing the reference configuration of undistorted austenite at the transformation temperature and @xmath18 denotes the deformed position of particle @xmath19 in @xmath17 .",
    "we remark that passing to the limit in these minimising sequences , corresponds in a very precise way to passing from a micro- to a macroscale , so that the limits themselves can be identified with the macroscopic deformations .",
    "the energy density @xmath20 depends only on the deformation gradient @xmath21 , a 3@xmath223 matrix with positive determinant , and the temperature @xmath23 .",
    "also @xmath24 is assumed frame indifferent , i.e. @xmath25 for all rotations @xmath26 - that is , for all 3@xmath223 matrices in @xmath27 and must respect the symmetry of the austenite , i.e. @xmath28 for all rotations @xmath29 leaving the austenite lattice invariant .",
    "for cubic austenite there are precisely 24 such rotations . below the transformation temperature , @xmath24 is minimised on the set @xmath30 of martensitic energy wells , that is @xmath20 is minimal for @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath32 , positive - definite , symmetric matrices @xmath33 are the pure stretch components of the transformation strains mapping the parent to the product lattice . for example , in the case of fcc to bcc or fcc to bct , these are given by the three bain strains @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "here @xmath37 is the lattice parameter of the fcc austenite and @xmath38 , @xmath39 are the lattice parameters of the bct martensite ( @xmath40 for bcc ) .",
    "the notation @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 has been chosen to emphasise that we are in the bain setting and to stay consistent with the literature .",
    "we remark that the bain transformation @xcite is widely accepted as the transformation from fcc to bct / bcc requiring least atomic movement ; for a rigorous justification see @xcite .    a convenient way to understand the relation between microstructures and minimising sequences is illustrated by the following example ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "( austenite - twinned martensite interface)[example1 ] +    suppose that a region of martensite is occupied by an array of twin related variants @xmath44  and  @xmath45 with relative volume fractions @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the strains @xmath44 and @xmath45 in general can not be invariant plane strains ( ips ) , equivalently , they can not form a fully coherent interface with austenite , represented in this model by the identity matrix @xmath48 . however , for specific volume fractions @xmath49 ( given by for the bain strain ) , the average deformation strain of the twinned region @xmath50 may indeed become an ips . in terms of the nonlinear elasticity model , this inability to form a fully coherent interface at the microscopic level , implies that the austenite - twinned martensite configuration can not exactly minimise the energy .",
    "nevertheless , one can construct an energy minimising sequence @xmath14 , @xmath15 , with gradients @xmath51 as in figure  [ fig : laminate ] .",
    "the limit of this sequence is precisely the average strain / total shape deformation @xmath52 that is an ips .",
    "although this average strain does not minimise the energy , it can be interpreted as a minimiser of a corresponding macroscopic energy . at the microscopic level",
    ", one would observe some specific element of the above minimising sequence rather than the limit , due to having neglected interfacial energy .",
    "the set of all matrices that can arise as limits of minimising sequences for the energy is referred to as the quasiconvex hull of the martensitic energy wells @xmath30 , denoted by @xmath53 .",
    "hence , the set @xmath53 corresponds to all possible homogeneous total shape deformations that are energy minimising at the macroscopic level .",
    "then , the requirement that ( up to an overall rotation @xmath26 ) a martensitic microstructure with a total shape deformation @xmath54 is a strain leaving the plane with normal @xmath55 invariant , amounts to finding a vector @xmath56 such that @xmath57 here , @xmath58 denotes the 3@xmath223 matrix @xmath59 . writing @xmath60 , yields the equivalent expression @xmath61 , implying that @xmath62 is the ips given by a shear on the plane with normal @xmath55 , with shearing direction @xmath63 and shearing magnitude @xmath64 . in particular , if the transformation from parent to product phase is volume - preserving",
    ", @xmath65 is a simple shear , corresponding to the vectors @xmath56 and @xmath55 being perpendicular .",
    "we note that equivalently says that @xmath62 can form a fully coherent planar interface with austenite of normal @xmath55 . also by frame - indifference",
    ", the austenite can be represented by any rotation .",
    "hence , a further rotation @xmath66 of the martensite results in @xmath67 , so that the rotated martensite can still form a fully coherent interface with austenite of the same normal @xmath55 . that is , rotations from the left can not change the habit plane normal .",
    "a common feature in both the phenomenological theory and the ball - james model is to construct ( up to an overall rotation @xmath26 ) a total shape deformation @xmath65 that is an ips . in the literature ,",
    "various algorithms have been proposed for the calculation of the corresponding elements of the shear , i.e. the magnitude , direction and normal ( cf . ) .",
    "for example , see @xcite in the context of twinning / single shear theories and @xcite for double shear theories .    in general , the problem of finding an overall rotation @xmath26 and shearing elements such that @xmath68 can be simplified by only considering the cauchy - green strain tensor @xmath69 and thus factoring out the overall rotation @xmath26 .",
    "the following proposition ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4 ) ) , allows one to calculate the shearing elements @xmath56 and @xmath55 in terms of the principal stretches and stretch vectors of @xmath65 .",
    "the overall rotation @xmath26 can then be found by substituting @xmath56 and @xmath55 back into equation .",
    "[ propbj ] let @xmath70 be a symmetric @xmath32 matrix with ordered eigenvalues @xmath71",
    ". then @xmath72 can be written as @xmath73 for some @xmath74 if and only if @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "then , there are at most two solutions given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a normalisation constant , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the ( normalised ) eigenvectors of @xmath72 corresponding to @xmath81 and @xmath82 .      in the material science literature twins",
    "are often described as two phases related by a specific @xmath83 degree rotation or , equivalently , a reflection . in the mathematical literature a twin is usually characterised by the existence of a rank - one connection between the two deformation strains @xmath44 , @xmath45 corresponding to the two phases , i.e. the existence of vectors @xmath84 and @xmath85 such that @xmath86 a fully coherent interface between the two phases is then given by the plane of normal @xmath85 .",
    "this is because for any vector @xmath87 on that plane , i.e. @xmath88 , we obtain @xmath89 .",
    "also , note that @xmath90 so that the lattice on the one side of the interface can be obtained by shearing the lattice on the other side along the twin plane @xmath91 , in the shearing direction @xmath92 with shearing magnitude @xmath93 .",
    "the latter expression enables one to calculate the vectors @xmath84 and @xmath85 by proposition  [ propbj ] through the identification @xmath94 , that is the relative deformation between the two phases is an ips . in view of single shear theories",
    ", the above expression can equivalently be written as @xmath95 and thus @xmath45 can be obtained as a shear of the parent lattice , followed by @xmath44 .",
    "hence , in the case of twins between two martensitic energy wells @xmath96 and @xmath97 one needs to solve the equation @xmath98 for the rotation matrix @xmath66 and the twinning elements @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "if the transformation strains @xmath33 and @xmath99 are related by a @xmath83 rotation , this calculation simplifies significantly by mallard s law ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* result 5.2 ) or below ) .",

    "we conclude this interlude by remarking that twins described by the first solution in mallard s law are _ type i _ twins and the corresponding lattices are related by a 180@xmath110 rotation about the twin plane @xmath111 .",
    "the second solution in mallard s law describes _ type ii _",
    "twins and the lattices are related by a 180@xmath110 rotation about the shearing direction @xmath92 .",
    "it may happen , and it does for the bain strains , that there are two rotations by 180@xmath110 relating @xmath102 and @xmath103 . in this case",
    ", there are seemingly four solutions from mallard s law , however , proposition  [ propbj ] says that there can not be more than two .",
    "indeed , the type i solution using one 180@xmath110 rotation is the same as the type ii solution using the other 180@xmath110 rotation and vice versa .",
    "in particular , the lattices on either side of the interface are related by both a 180@xmath110 rotation about the twin plane and a 180@xmath110 rotation about the shearing direction .",
    "solutions of this type are _ compound _ twins .",
    "henceforth , we only consider the bain strains @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 for the fcc to bct / bcc transformation in steel .",
    "in single shear theories the total shape deformation is assumed to be decomposable into @xmath112 where @xmath26 is a rotation , @xmath113 is one of the bain strains and @xmath114 is a shear whose specific form varies in the literature . in the ball - james theory ,",
    "the total shape deformation @xmath65 must be macroscopically energy minimising , thus restricting the form of the shear @xmath115 .",

    "we then obtain all crystallographically equivalent normals .",
    "for the volume - preserving bain strain , the habit plane normals that can arise from the family @xmath179 are visualised in figure  [ figfirstsolline ] .",
    "however , due to algebraic complexity , it is difficult to write down a formula for the habit plane normals with an explicit dependence on @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath127 .",
    "it is natural to assume that the observed total shape deformation @xmath65 requires small overall atomic movement ( see also @xcite ) relative to the parent phase of austenite .",
    "a measure of this distance is the _ _ strain energy _ _ which yields the same results . ] given by @xmath182 where @xmath183 denotes the frobenius norm and @xmath184 the principal stretches of @xmath65 .",
    "it can be shown that any microstructure with small strain energy must necessarily involve all three bain variants in roughly similar volume fractions .",
    "in particular , this can not be the case for an array of twin related variants and we ought to consider at least twins within twins ( see also fig .",
    "[ figdis ] ) .",
    "although , introducing even further levels of twinning can reduce the strain energy , one could argue that interfacial energy contributions , which are not accounted for in this model , may inhibit such behaviour .",
    "combining the fact that @xmath10 can not result from simple twinning ( cf .",
    "[ figsimplnormals ] ) and that twins within twins are preferable in terms of strain energy , we build a theory that predicts @xmath10 habit plane normals solely based on energy minimisation and geometric compatibility .",
    "firstly , the one - parameter families of habit plane normals obtained from twins within twins ( see section  [ secdoubleshear ] ) , contain normals very close to any @xmath10 .",
    "this is at least the case for lattice parameters close to @xmath185 , @xmath186 corresponding to a volume - preserving transformation from fcc to bcc .",

    "the resulting one - parameter families of habit plane normals , along with their crystallographically equivalent ones , are shown in figure  [ fignorm ] .",
    "we stress that the only free parameter in the generation of these normals is @xmath127 which fixes the choice of the shearing systems , based only on the energy minimising property of the microstructure .",
    "secondly , out of these one - parameter families of normals , our theory can identify the @xmath10 habit plane normals as those satisfying a criterion of maximal compatibility . to this end , revisiting our construction of twins within twins there is a choice ( cf . ) of using either @xmath187 as an average strain , corresponding to the type i solution from mallard s law , or @xmath188 corresponding to type ii .",
    "figure  [ figdis ] shows the strain energy associated with the two macroscopic strains as a function of @xmath127 .",
    "it is clear that the strain energy of @xmath187 is significantly smaller than that of @xmath188 and is thus preferable .",
    "we also note that , in agreement with the previous section , the strain energies of both @xmath189 and @xmath190 increase rapidly as the volume fraction of @xmath41 approaches @xmath191 or @xmath192 , that is as the microstructure reduces to a single twinning system .",
    "further , we remark that the @xmath188 with minimal strain energy result in habit plane normals which are very nearly @xmath193 ( see also fig .  [ fignorm ] ) . nevertheless , the strain energies of any of the @xmath187 that give rise to @xmath10 normals are lower ( cf .",

    "]    even though , the strains resulting in @xmath10 habit plane normals do not minimise the strain energy , they satisfy a strong criterion of compatibility . to understand",
    "this one must think in terms of the dynamic process of nucleation .",
    "as austenite is rapidly quenched , the martensite phase nucleates at various sites .",
    "the strain in a given nucleation site may need to be an ips but otherwise , has no reason to be the same as the strain in any other site . nevertheless , there are essentially only three distinct families of systems of twins within twins and these can be classified by the bain variant which is present in both of the simple twinning systems that comprise the overall microstructure . in figure",
    "[ fignorm ] , these three families are distinguished by colour . as the nuclei grow and approach other nuclei , they need to remain compatible with each other .",
    "remarkably , the only habit plane normals that arise from deformations with low strain energy and can be reached by all three families are @xmath10 . in figure",
    "[ fignorm ] , this can be seen from the fact that all differently coloured curves intersect close to @xmath10 .",
