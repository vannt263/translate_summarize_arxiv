    "r0.5    the design luminosity of the future high - energy electron - positron colliders requires transverse beam sizes at the nanometre level at the interaction point ( ip ) , as well as stabilisation of the electron and positron beam collision overlaps at the sub - nanometre level .",
    "static and dynamic imperfections of the machine generate beam jitter , which can dramatically degrade the luminosity .",
    "[ bbdeflection ] shows an example of luminosity loss versus the relative offset of the colliding beams for both ilc @xcite and clic @xcite with nominal beam parameters .",
    "the red curve is the geometric luminosity analytically calculated .",
    "the blue and green curves correspond to the luminosity loss for ilc and clic , respectively , computed using the code guinea - pig @xcite .",
    "for instance , in order to maintain the luminosity 10% of nominal the electron and positron beam vertical position overlap needs to be stabilised to within @xmath0 for ilc and @xmath1 for clic .    in order to achieve the required beam stability goals , beam - based feedback ( fb ) systems , operating at different timescales ,",
    "are designed to be distributed in the linac and the beam delivery system ( bds ) . in this paper",
    "we concretely study the luminosity performance with fast intra - train beam - based fb systems at the ip in presence of dynamic imperfections , e.g. ground motion ( gm ) .",
    "simulation results are presented and discussed in section  [ simula ] for both ilc and clic .    to illustrate the train structure of linear colliders table  [ tableparams ] shows some relevant design parameters of ilc and clic .",
    "the ilc is an example of cold-rf based design ( superconducting rf cavities ) @xcite .",
    "the ilc repetition frequency is 5 hz , and the bunch train comprises 2820 bunches with a nominal inter - bunch separation of 308  ns .",
    "this time structure would allow the bunch - to - bunch feedback correction using digital fb processors .",
    "clic is based in a so - called warm-rf design ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) , with beam time structures much shorter than for the ilc . for clic with a nominal inter - bunch separation of 0.5  ns and a nominal train length of 156",
    "ns the design of an ip intra - pulse fb system is very challenging .",
    "r0.5        the beam - beam jitter induced by imperfections of the machine can be counteracted by using fast intra - train feedback systems near the ip .",
    "the ip - fb systems could be considered as the last weapon of defence against , for example , transverse jitters of the final focus magnets .",
    "a fast ip - fb system for linear colliders is based on the measurement of the incoming trajectories of the early bunches in the electron or positron trains .",
    "this information is then used as the input to the feedback system for steering the later bunches into collisions at the ip .",
    "[ basicschematic ] shows a basic scheme of a beam - based ip - fb system .",
    "the key components of the system are a beam position monitor ( bpm ) for registering the beam orbit , and a kicker for applying a position ( or angle ) correction to the beam .",
    "additional hardware components , such as bpm signal processor board , fb circuit and fast amplifier , are described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we have developed a beam transport model for linear colliders based on the tracking code placet @xcite .",
    "sliced bunches are tracked along the main linac .",
    "the linac simulations include both short and long - range transverse and longitudinal wakefield effects of the accelerating cavities .",
    "for the tracking through the bds each bunch is binned in a certain number of macro - particles ( here we have used 50000 macro - particles ) .",
    "survey alignment errors and dynamic imperfections ( ground motion ) can be included in the model .",
    "the code guinea - pig @xcite is used to evaluate the luminosity and the beam - beam deflection for electron - positron beam collisions at the ip .",
    "r0.5        intra - train ip position fb corrections can be applied using a stripline kicker located near the ip in the incoming beamline between the sextupole sd0 and the final quadrupole qf1 . at @xmath2 phase advance downstream of the ip a bpm measures the beam positions to determine the deflection angle of the beams .",
    "usually bpm resolutions of @xmath3 m are sufficient for these measurements . on the other hand , to correct the angle , a stripline kicker is located at the entrance of the final focus system with a downstream bpm at @xmath2 phase advance . for the simulations we use a fb loop based in a proportional and integral ( pi ) control algorithm @xcite .",
    "we have studied the performance of the fb system in terms of correcting the position jitter generated by ground motion . using the gm models  @xcite , 0.2 s of gm",
    "is applied to both e@xmath4 linac+bds and e@xmath5 linac+bds .",
    "the resulting luminosity for a single seed of gm as a function of bunch number in a train is shown in fig .",
    "[ ilcluminosity ] , where different scenarios of gm are compared . for the noisiest site ( model c ) , applying fast position fb stabilisation , a recovery of the luminosity up to 85% of the nominal value is obtained .",
    "on the other hand , for quiet sites ( models a and b ) practically 100% of the nominal luminosity would be achievable with the ip - fb correction .",
    "latency times of about 20  ns have experimentally been demonstrated by the font3 system @xcite using an analogue fb processor .",
    "therefore , for the clic simulations we have considered a correction iteration every 20  ns . taking into account the clic nominal bunch separation of 0.5  ns , this system performs approximately a correction every 40 bunches ( @xmath6 iterations per pulse ) .    for the clic ip position fb simulations , the kicker or corrector has been located in the incoming beamline immediately downstream of the final quadrupole qd0 . at @xmath2 phase advance downstream of the ip a bpm , with @xmath7 m resolution ,",
    "measures the beam positions . in this case",
    "we have employed a fb control loop based in a simple proportional control algorithm . unlike the angle bunch - to - bunch fb system for ilc , due to latency constraints no angle intra - train fb system has been designed for clic .    in this case , applying the model c of gm , simulations of clic ( fig .",
    "[ clicluminosity ] ) has shown a recovery of about @xmath8 of the nominal luminosity using the intra - train position fb system at the ip . with model",
    "k the fb system manages to recover about @xmath9 of the nominal luminosity . for quiet sites ( models a and b )",
    "practically 100% of the nominal luminosity would be achievable .",
    "beam - based feedback systems will be mandatory to achieve the required luminosity goals of the future electron - positron linear colliders .",
    "in particular we have simulated the performance of intra - train beam - based fb systems at the ip .",
    "these fb systems reduce the transverse beam - beam jitters and steer the electron and positron beams into collision .",
    "simulation results are presented for ilc and clic in terms of correcting the transverse vertical jitters generated by ground motion . for quiet sites ( models a and b )",
    "practically 100% of the nominal luminosity would be achievable using the ip - fb systems .",
    "however , assuming the most severe scenario ( gm model c ) , intra - train fb systems at the ip are not enough to achieve the nominal luminosity .",
    "this is due to remaining uncorrected pulse - to - pulse jitter , which could in principle be corrected with additional upstream slower fb systems in the bds .",
