    "blazars are known for their highly variable broadband emission .",
    "they are characterized by a doubly humped spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , attributed to non - thermal emission , and spectral variability .",
    "the sed and variability patterns can be used as key observational features to place constraints on the nature of the particle population , acceleration of particles , and the environment around the jet that is responsible for the observed emission .",
    "conversely , incorporating the nature of the particle population and the jet environment , as accurately as possible , in modeling such observational features can enable us to reach a better agreement between theoretical and observational results .",
    "thus , exploring the environment of a blazar jet in an anisotropic and time - dependent manner is important for connecting the pieces together and putting tighter constraints on the origin of @xmath1-ray emission .",
    "blazars , a combination of bl lacertae ( bl lac ) objects and flat spectrum radio - loud quasars ( fsrqs ) , are divided into various subclasses depending on the location of the peak of the low - energy ( synchrotron ) sed component .",
    "the synchrotron peak lies in the infrared regime , with @xmath2 hz , in low - synchrotron - peaked ( lsp ) blazars comprising fsrqs and low - frequency peaked bl lac objects ( lbls ) . in the case of",

    "the high - energy ( he ) component of blazars can be a result of inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of synchrotron photons internal to the jet resulting in synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission @xcite",
    ". it could also be due to upscattering of accretion - disk photons @xcite , and/or photons initially from the accretion disk being scattered by the broad - line region ( blr ) @xcite , and/or seed photons from a surrounding dusty torus ( dt ) @xcite . in the case of hbls",
    ", the he component is usually well reproduced with a synchrotron / ssc leptonic jet model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas an additional external compton ( ec ) component is almost always required to fit the high - energy spectra of fsrqs , lbls , and ibls ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "detailed numerical calculations for compton scattering processes have been carried out for many specific models of blazar jet emission that involve their environment .",
    "@xcite have calculated compton scattering of target photons in the thomson regime from an optically thick and geometrically thin , thermal accretion disk based on the model of @xcite .",
    "quasi - isotropic seed photon fields due to blr or dt have also been considered to obtain compton - scattered high - energy spectra in the thomson limit by several authors @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "extensive calculations involving anisotropic accretion - disk and blr seed photon fields have been considered as well @xcite .",
    "anisotropic radiation fields of the disk , the blr , and the dt have been studied previously by @xcite , but primarily in the context of @xmath0 interaction of these photons with the gev and tev photons produced in the jet .",
    "anisotropic treatment of blr and dt photons , focussing on jet emission and rapid non - thermal flares , was carried out by @xcite .",
    "these authors studied parameters describing the properties of blr and dt that govern the interplay between the dominance of ssc and ec emission and their subsequent impact on seds , as well as relative time delays between light curves at different frequencies . for the purposes of their study",
    ", they used an integrated intensity - instead of considering line and continuum intensities separately - of the incident emission from the blr .",
    "the emitting plasma was assumed to be located at parsec scales and the evolution of he emission at sub - pc distances was ignored .",
    "recently , anisotropic treatment of disk and blr target radiation fields has been considered by @xcite .",
    "the authors have calculated accurate @xmath1-ray spectra due to inverse comptonization of such seed photon fields throughout the thomson and klein - nishina ( kn ) regimes to model fsrq blazars , although in a one - zone scenario .",
    "also , these authors evolve the system to only sub - pc distances along the jet axis , limiting themselves to locations within the blr .",
    "in addition to this , one - zone leptonic jet models were recently shown @xcite to have severe limitations in attempts to reproduce very high energy ( vhe ) flares , such as that of 3c  279 detected in 2006 @xcite .    in a more recent approach , @xcite has considered an anisotropic seed photon field of the dt to calculate the resultant ec component of he emission from blazar jets , in a turbulent extreme multi - zone scenario .",
    "while the @xmath1-ray spectra are calculated throughout the thomson and kn regimes , the energy loss rates are limited to only the thomson regime . for the problem that work addresses ,",
    "the system is located _ beyond _ the blr , at parsec - scale distances from the central engine .    here ,",
    "we extend the previous approach of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper 1 ) , which calculated the synchrotron and ssc emission from blazar jets , to address some of the limitations of the models mentioned above .",
    "we use a fully time - dependent , 1-d multi - zone with radiation feedback , leptonic jet model in the internal shock scenario , shortened to the multi zone radiation feedback , muzorf , model .",
    "we evolve the system from sub - pc to pc scale distances along the jet axis .",
    "we consider anisotropic target radiation fields to calculate the he spectra resulting from ec scattering processes .",
    "the entire spectrum is calculated throughout the thomson and kn regimes , thereby making it applicable to all classes of blazars .",
    "we include the attenuation of jet @xmath1-rays through @xmath0 absorption ( described in paper 1 ) due to the presence of target radiation fields inside the jet , in a self - consistent manner .",
    "the generalized approach of our model lets us account for the constantly changing contribution of each of the seed photon field sources in producing he emission in a self - consistent and time - dependent manner .",
    "this is especially relevant for understanding the origin of @xmath1-ray emission from blazar jets .    in a number of previous analyses",
    ", the region within the blr has been considered the most favorable location for @xmath1-ray emission , with a range limited to between 0.01 and 0.3 pc @xcite .",
    "the reason behind this is the short intra - day variability timescales observed in some @xmath1-ray flares , which indicated on the basis of light crossing timescales that the emission region is small and hence not be too far away from the central engine @xcite . at the same time , the emission region can not be too close to the central engine without violating constraints placed by the @xmath0 absorption process @xcite . as a result",
    ", an emission region location closer to the blr was considered the most favorable position due to the strong dependence of the scattered flux on the level of boosting and the energy of incoming photons @xcite .",
    "contrary to the above scenario , recent observations have shown coincidences of @xmath1-ray outbursts with radio events on pc scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this seems to suggest a cospatial origin of radio and @xmath1-ray events located at such distances . as a result",
    ", some authors conclude that the @xmath1-ray emitting region could also lie outside of the blr @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to understand the origin of @xmath1-ray emission , it is important to let the system being modeled evolve to beyond the blr and into the dt , and to include its contribution to the production of @xmath1-ray emission . here , we focus our attention toward understanding the dependence of @xmath1-ray emission on the combination of various intrinsic physical parameters .",
    "we explore this aspect by including various components of seed photon fields in order to obtain a complete picture of their contribution in producing @xmath1-ray emission and understand their effects on the dynamic evolution of seds and spectral variability patterns .    in  [ method ] , we describe our ec framework of including anisotropic seed photon fields from the accretion - disk , the blr , and the dt .",

    "appendix [ loseqns ] delineates the details of line - of - sight calculations for the blr line and diffuse continuum emission used in obtaining the intensity of incoming blr photons .",
    "we consider a multi - zone time - dependent leptonic jet model with radiation - feedback scheme as described in paper 1 .",
    "we extend our previous model of synchrotron / ssc emission to include the ec component in order to simulate the sed and spectral variability patterns of blazars .",
    "we consider three sources of external seed photon fields , namely the accretion disk , the blr , and the dt .",
    "we evolve the emission region in the jet from sub - pc to pc scales ( within the dt ) and follow the evolution of the sed and spectral variability patterns over a period of @xmath8 1 day , corresponding to the timescale of a rapid nonthermal flare .",
    "such a comprehensive approach can be used as an important tool for connecting the origin of @xmath1-ray emission of a flare to its multiwavelength properties .    as in paper 1",
    ", we consider a cylindrical emission region for our current study .",
    "we assume the emitting volume to be well collimated out to pc distances , which is a safe assumption to make based on the work of @xcite , and hence do not consider the effects of adiabatic expansion on the evolution of the strength of the magnetic field or the electron population in the emission region .",
    "the size of the emission region is assumed to be small in comparison to the sizes of and distances to the external seed photon field sources .",
    "this way , the external radiation can be safely assumed to be homogeneous throughout the emitting plasma , although it is still highly anisotropic in the comoving frame of the plasma . in our current framework , we do not simulate radio emission as the calculated flux is well below the actual radio value .",
    "this is because we follow the early phase of @xmath1-ray production corresponding to a shock position upto @xmath8 1 pc in the lab frame . during this phase ,",
    "the emission region is highly optically thick to ghz radio frequencies .",
    "the angular dependence of the incoming radiation and the amount to which it contributes toward ec emission is determined by the geometry of all three seed photon field sources and the location of the emission region along the jet axis .",
    "in addition , the anisotropy is further enhanced due to relativistic aberration and doppler boosting or deboosting in the plasma frame . we assume the external radiation to be constant in time over the period of our simulation .",

    "this in turn , lowers the cdf to 6.35 and shifts the locations of the transition and peak - ec - component frequencies leftward . since the high - frequency end of the synchrotron compoent no longer extends into the x - ray range in this case , the sh of the sed in this regime increases to @xmath297 . on the other hand , the fermi range sh , with @xmath298 , is higher than that of run 1 but lower in comparison to run 6 .",
    "this is because , in this case , the 10 gev emission comes from the softer part of the he component , which is well below the peak of the ec component , compared to that of run 6 . in addition to this , there is weaker radiative cooling of particles due to ec processes compared to that of run 1 . as a result ,",

    ", the r - band light curve continues to rise for as long as the fs is in the system .",
    "but , as explained in section [ varz ] for the case of run 4 , since higher energy electrons are responsible for the optical synchrotron pulse than those for the 10 kev pulse , the optical pulse declines quickly enough to match the declining pulse profile of that of run 1 , once the fs shock crosses the system at @xmath300 53 ks .",
    "the 1 mev pulse , in the case of run 5 , is dominated by the rising but softer part of the ecdt component .",
    "this implies that lower energy particles are responsible for producing this pulse , compared to those of run 1 , thereby causing it to peak later . on the other hand ,",
    "in the case of run 6 , the r - band pulse exhibits exactly the opposite effect to that of run 5 due to an increased compton cooling rate owing to a higher value of @xmath194 . as a result",

    "is dominated by the low - frequency end of the ecdt process . as a result ,",
    "the corresponding spectrum is softer because low - energy electrons are responsible for producing this pulse .",
    "this is why the pulse peaks later than that of run 1 , but at the same time as that of run 5 . the 1 mev pulse , on the other hand , is dominated by the rising part of the ecblr component and is due to higher energy electrons in the region , which is why the pulse starts to peak sooner , undergoes a gradual buildup , and declines faster compared to that of run 1 .",
    "as far as the 100 gev pulse for runs 5 and 6 is concerned , it follows the same profile as that of run 1 because of reasons explained in section [ baseset ] .      the impact of decreasing ( run 7 ) or increasing ( run 8) the covering factor of the dt on the time - averaged sed and light curves of a generic blazar is shown in fig .",
    "[ 178sedlcs ] .",

    "hence , the synchrotron emission rises , slightly decreasing the cdf to 10.1 .",

    "contrary to the above scenario , increasing @xmath237 to 0.9 and shrinking the dt such that @xmath308 cm ( run 8) enhances the emission of the torus as received by the emission region .",
    "this makes the contribution of the ecdt component comparable to that of the ecblr emission , as can be seen from fig .",

    "this has the opposite effect to that of run 7 , although the overall change in the sed , in this case , is not as significant and closely follows that of run 1 . to summarize the impact , the cdf increases slightly to 14.6 and the peak ec - component frequency shifts slightly to lower frequencies .",
    "the sh in the x - ray regime decreases slightly compared to that of run 1 , while the sh at 10 gev increases slightly such that @xmath309 .",
    "this is because , in this case , the contribution of the ecblr component decreases slightly compared to that of run 1 , which implies comparatively less cooling and the presence of more higher - energy electrons , which gives rise to a harder spectra at that energy range .    the right side of fig .",
    "[ 178sedlcs ] compares light curves for runs 7 , and 8 against those of run 1 .",

    ", the synchrotron - dominated r - band pulse lasts for a slightly longer duration due to a decreased compton cooling rate and consequently an increased amount of synchrotron emission . as a result , it peaks later than that of run 1 but lasts only for as long as the fs is inside the emission region and declines afterwards due to the reasons given in section [ baseset ] . at 10 kev , the pulse of run 7 peaks at the same time and has a similar profile as that of run 1 , but lasts a bit longer due to an increased contribution from the ssc emission . on the other hand , unlike the case for run 1 , the 1 mev emission in run 7 is dominated by the rising part of the ecblr component involving comparatively lower - energy electrons . as a result , the corresponding pulse peaks later before declining along with those of runs 1 and 8 .",
    "we would like to point out here that the 1 mev light curve for run 7 has really only one peak .",
    "the slight depression seen at around 63000s is more of a numerical artifact resulting due to the not - so - high resolution of the electron and photon energy grid . as is seen in the other cases , the 100 gev pulse for runs 7 and 8 follows the same profile as that of run 1 because of reasons explained in section [ baseset ] .",
    "we have extended the scope of the multi - zone time - dependent leptonic jet model , with radiation feedback scheme , in the internal shock scenario , of @xcite ( known for short as the multi zone radiation feedback , muzorf , model ) to include the ec component by considering anisotropic target radiation fields .",
    "the current model is now applicable to a broader class of blazars , including fsrqs , lbls , and ibls , and allows us to distinguish and quantify the contribution of each of the seed photon fields in producing high - energy emission of blazars out to @xmath8 pc scales .    in our approach ,",
    "we consider three sources of seed photon fields , namely the accretion disk , the blr , and the dt .",
    "we let the system evolve to beyond the blr and into the dt , and calculate the corresponding distance- and time - dependent ec emission according to the prescription described in sections [ disksec ] to [ dtsec ] .",
    "in our current work , we have not considered detailed spectral fitting and analysis to compare against the multiwavelength seds and light curves of blazars available through campaigns involving the _ fermi gamma ray space telescope _ , which we leave to future work .",
    "instead , we have carried out a parameter study of rapid variability , on timescales of @xmath8 1 day , between optical , x - ray , and @xmath1-ray energies .",
    "we point out that the muzorf model is applicable to ec emission up to only a few parsecs .",
    "this is because currently it does not include adiabatic cooling , which is relevant for evolving the system out to several parsecs .",
    "this is a work in progress that we plan to address in the future .",
    "we have carried out a parameter study to understand the effects of varying input parameters relevant to the ec emission on the dynamic evolution of the sed and light curves of a generic blazar .",
    "a number of input parameters , such as the location of the emission region along the jet axis ( @xmath263 ) , the covering factor of the blr ( @xmath310 ) , and that of the dusty torus ( @xmath237 ) were varied .",
    "the goal of the study was to understand the dependence of the contribution of each of the target photon field components on such parameters in producing he emission of blazars .",
    "anisotropic target radiation fields were considered from each of the seed photon field components in order to enable the system to evolve beyond the blr and allow the contribution of each of the three components to be incorporated as accurately as possible . as has been demonstrated in  [ dtsec ] , the range of angles covered by incoming dt photons , in the anisotropic case , is quite narrow . for the cases considered here , the dt played an important role in contributing toward @xmath1-ray emission in the mev range , while the blr contributed mostly in the high mev - low gev range .",
    "for the value of @xmath51 and @xmath263 considered in all of our cases , the emission due to the ecd process was found to be negligible for the level of fluxes considered here .",
    "this is because of the amount of de - boosting of disk photons when entering the jet from behind or from the side at those positions",
    ". similar evolution of the ecd emission with @xmath263 was also found by @xcite .    for all cases , the 100 gev light curves always led the x - rays and mev emission , while for some cases they either led or peaked at the same time as the optical light curves , depending on the parameter that was varied for those simulations .",
    "more symmetric pulse profiles were obtained for higher frequency light curves than those for lower frequency ones .",
    "similar behavior of pulse profiles were also found by @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated , that for the case where the emission region was placed beyond the blr , the he emission was primarily due to ecdt and ssc processes .",
    "this can be extrapolated to conclude that as the distance of the emitting plasma from the central engine increases , ssc starts to dominate over ec emission due to a substantially reduced amount of doppler boosting of incoming seed photon fields .",
    "the ec losses then become a fraction of the synchrotron losses , and ssc flux exceeds the ec flux @xcite .",
    "similar results are achieved if the energy density of the blr or dt radiation is reduced , which also introduces an optical lag relative to the he @xmath1-ray variations @xcite .",
    "in addition to these input parameters , another factor that plays an important role in deciding the duration of he pulses and the range of the location of @xmath1-ray emission is the time of exit of shocks from their respective emitting regions .",
    "this is because , as discussed in  [ paramstud ] , @xmath1-ray emission is produced by highly energetic leptons , which , in turn , are produced in the system for as long as the shocks are present and accelerating particles to such high energies .",
    "therefore , analyzing the effects of the combination of the factors discussed above on the evolution of the system is crucial to understanding the origin of @xmath1-ray emission and its relationship with emission at lower frequencies .",
    "understanding of the sources of seed photons is imperative in order to comprehend the he emission of blazars in general . at the same time",
    ", it is important to realize that at distances of several parsecs from the central engine , the target photon field from these components is quite weak . in that case",
    ", these three conventional sources might not explain the high @xmath1-ray luminosity and correlation between @xmath1-ray and radio events that have been observed at such distances @xcite .",
    "in such a scenario , considering possible new sources of seed photon fields or modifying the placement of the existing ones becomes important .",
    "the latter might include , ( 1 ) a variable location of the @xmath1-ray emitting zone @xcite , ( 2 ) an outflowing blr serving as a source of external seed photons at parsec scales @xcite , ( 3 ) the presence of some stray blr material surrounding the radio core that could produce required density of target photons at those distances @xcite , or ( 4 ) an additional but internal source of seed photons , such as a mach disk , in tandem with dt photon field @xcite .",
    "such possibilities should be explored in producing the @xmath1-ray luminosity at those length scales .",
