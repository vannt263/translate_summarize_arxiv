    "the intercluster media ( icm ) of several clusters of galaxies , in addition to the well studied thermal bremssstrahlung ( tb ) emission in the 2 to 10 kev soft x - ray ( sxr ) region , show growing evidence for nonthermal activity , first observed in form of diffuse radio radiation ( classified either as relic or halo sources ) and more recently , at extreme ultraviolet ( 0.07 - 0.4 kev ; euv ) and hard x - ray ( 20 to 80 kev ; hxr ) regions . in the next section i will give a brief review of the status of these observations and present new yet unpublished hxr observation of another cluster , and in  3 i will compare the merits of different emission mechanisms proposed for production of these radiation .",
    "even though the presence of nonthermal electrons in the icm was established decades ago very little theoretical treatment of the acceleration mechanism was carried out ( see e.g. schlikeiser , siervers & thiemann 1987 ) until the discovery of the euv and hxr radiations . given the meager amount of the data , detailed calculations of the energy sources and the exact mechanisms of the acceleration may be premature .",
    "consequently , i will emphasize the general physical characteristics and not the numerical details of the problem .",
    "it turns out that one can put significant and meaningful constraints on the general aspects of the acceleration mechanism .",
    "i will describe these in  4 .",
    "the first cluster observed to have * diffuse radio emission * was the coma cluster and recent systematic searches have identified more than 30 cluster with halo or relic sources .",
    "the rate of occurrence of these sources increases with cluster redshift @xmath0 , sxr luminosity or temperature @xmath1 ( giovannini & feretti 2000 ) .",
    "there is little doubt that this radiation is due to synchrotron emission in a magnetic field of strength @xmath2 by a population of relativistic electrons of lorentz factor @xmath3 . in the case of coma",
    "the electron spectra may be represented by a broken power law ( rephaeli 1979 ) or a power law with an exponential cutoff ( schlikeiser et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "* extreme uv * ( 0.07 to 0.4 kev ) radiation was detected by the _ extreme ultraviolet explorer _ from coma ( liu et al .",
    "1966 ) and some other clusters . a cooler ( @xmath4 ) component and inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons by relativistic ( @xmath5 ) electrons are two possible ways of producing this excess radiation . some of the observations and the emission process are still controversial ( see asp proc .. 301 , 2003 , eds .",
    "stewart bowyer & chorng - yuan hwang ) .",
    "i will not discuss this emission any further here .",
    "the third evidence for nonthermal activity comes from the observations of excess * hxr * emission in the 20 to 80 kev range by instruments on board _ beppo_sax and _ rxte _ satellites .",
    "each of these observatories has detected hxr excess from abell 2256 once and coma twice , although the second _ beppo_sax observation shows a weaker signal ( fusco - femiano et al .",
    "1999 and rephaeli et al . 1999 , 2002 ) .",
    "hxr detections have also been reported in abell clusters 754 , 2199 , 2319 and 3667 all in the redshift range @xmath6 .",
    "most of these excesses can be best fitted with a fairly hard spectrum ( photon power - law index @xmath7 ) .",
    "recently , detection of nonthermal x - rays ( albeit at lower energies ) have been reported from a cluster ic 1262 ( hudson et al .",
    "2003 ) . in figure 1",
    "i show the hxr spectrum and its characteristics from cluster rx - j0658 with a considerably higher redshift ( @xmath8 ) obtained by _",
    "rxte_. these observations encompass a wide range of temperature , redshift and luminosity , indicating that hxr emission may be a common property of all clusters with significant diffuse radio emission .",
    "figure 2 ( left panel ) shows the photon flux at all wavelengths from coma , where in addition to the above mentioned radiations , we show the gamma - ray upper limit from egret on board _ cgro _ ( sreekumar et al . 1996 ) , and the equivalent flux for the cmb and optical radiation density present in the cluster .",
    "( to these should be added the contribution from far ir background radiation . ) similarly , an equivalent flux has been indicated for the static magnetic field of @xmath9 g , which is the size of the field strength deduced in several clusters ( eilek 1999 , clarke et al .",
    "the observed faraday rotation of the coma cluster can be interpreted as indicating a uniform magnetic field along the line of sight of @xmath10 g . however , the field lines are most likely chaotic .",
    "kim et al ( 1990 ) and clarke et al . ( 2003 ) estimate a mean magnetic field of @xmath11 g . it should be however noted that the interpretation of these observations is controversial ( see rudnick & blundell 2002 ) .",
    "the hxr emission could be produced via ic scattering of cmb photons by the same population of relativistic electrons responsible for the radio emission ( see e.g. sarazin & lieu 1998 ) shown by the solid lines in figure 2 ( right panel ) .",
    "however , simple arguments show that this scenario requires a field strength @xmath12 g , which is much smaller than values of several @xmath13 g deduced from faraday rotation mentioned above and equipartition arguments .",
    "consequently , several workers have proposed nonthermal bremsstrahlung ( ntb ) for the hxr emissions ( enlin et al .",
    "1999 , sarazin & kempner 2000 , blasi 2000 ) .",
    "the dotted line in figure 2 ( right panel ) shows the spectrum of the required electrons .",
    "however , as shown by petrosian ( 2001 , * p01 * ) , the ntb process faces a serious difficulty , which is hard to circumvent .",
    "this is because compared to coulomb losses the bremsstrahlung yield is very small ; @xmath14 ( see petrosian 1973 ) .",
    "thus , for a hxr luminosity of @xmath15 erg s@xmath16 ( for coma ) , a power of @xmath17 erg s@xmath16 is fed into the icm , increasing its temperature to @xmath18 k after @xmath19 yr or to @xmath20 k in a hubble time !",
    "therefore , _ the ntb emission phase , if any , must be very short lived_.    this inefficiency of the ntb appears more serious than the inefficiency of the ic relative to the synchrotron process .",
    "there are several arguments which indicate that a higher @xmath21 field can be tolerated in the ic model ( see * p01 * ) .",
    "briefly , this discrepancy can be alleviated by i ) a more realistic electron spectral distribution ( e.g. exponential spectral break beyond @xmath22 ) ; ii ) a non - isotropic pitch angle distribution ( epstein 1973 ) ; and iii ) spatial inhomgeneities ( goldschmidt & rephaeli 1993 , govoni et al .",
    "finally , the faraday rotation measures may give a somewhat biased view of the @xmath21 field by selecting clusters with the highest values of @xmath21 while the euv or hxr observations favor clusters with low values of @xmath21 .",
    "the cluster rx - j0658 was chosen for observations because it was estimated that it should have relatively high ic flux of @xmath23 erg @xmath24 s@xmath16 which is what is observed .",
    "this increases our confidence in the validity of the ic model .",
    "it turns out that the acceleration mechanism of electrons can also be constrained significantly , even though we have very limited data .",
    "this mechanism should produce the relativistic electron spectra shown in figure 2 ( right panel ) .",
    "the lifetimes of these electrons are longer than their crossing time , @xmath25 yr .",
    "therefore , these electrons will escape the cluster and radiate most of their energy outside it unless there exists some scattering agent with a mean free path @xmath26 kpc to trap the electrons in the icm for at least a timescale of @xmath27 yr , for cluster size @xmath28mpc .",
    "* turbulence * can be this agent and can play a role in stochastic acceleration directly , or indirectly in acceleration by * shocks*. both shocks and turbulence can presumably be produced during merger events .",
    "several lines of arguments point to an icm which is highly turbulent .",
    "the possible scenarios of acceleration by turbulence and/or shocks are explored in * p01 * leading to the following conclusions : i ) the seed electrons can not be the icm thermal electrons for the same reason that the ntb fails as a source of hxrs , namely because it will lead to excessive heating of the icm .",
    "therefore , we require injection of high energy ( @xmath29 mev ) electrons into the icm , presumably from galaxies or agns .",
    "ii ) the short lifetimes of the relevant electrons with respect to @xmath30 and the small @xmath31 imply a continuous and _ in situ _ acceleration process .",
    "iii ) a _ steady state _ model seems natural but it leads to a flatter spectrum than required unless the turbulence has an unreasonably steep spectrum .",
    "iv ) _ time dependent models _ can produce the desired spectra but only for a short period ( @xmath32 to @xmath33 yr ) implying an _ episodic acceleration process _ induced by merger activity .",
