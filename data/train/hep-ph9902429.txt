    "large rapidity - gap events observed recently at hera @xcite provide additional impetus to qcd calculation of diffractive scattering and total cross section . at virtuality @xmath3 , the qcd fine structure constant @xmath4 is small",
    ", near - forward parton - parton scattering is in principle calculable in perturbation theory , and total cross section can be obtained via the optical theorem . to be sure ,",
    "such calculation is very complicated at high c.m .",
    "energy @xmath5 , as the effective expansion parameter for the problem is @xmath6 and not just @xmath7 .",
    "the former could be large at high @xmath8 even though the latter may be small . as a result",
    ", multi - loop diagrams must be included .    to make multi - loop calculations feasible , _ leading - log approximation _ ( lla ) is usually employed .",
    "this consists of keeping only the highest power of @xmath9 at each order .",
    "equivalently , if the scattering amplitude ( divided by @xmath8 ) is considered as a function of the two variables @xmath7 and @xmath6 , then only the lowest power of @xmath7 is kept .",
    "when the resulting amplitude is of the form @xmath10 for some function @xmath11 , we will abbreviate it simply as @xmath12 .",
    "the lla result for high - energy near - forward scattering is known , though not completely .",
    "the dominant parton - parton scattering amplitude occurs with the exchange of a colour - octet object called the reggeon ( or the reggeized gluon ) , and is @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the reggeon amplitude is actually proportional to @xmath14 , with @xmath15 the square of the momentum transfer , and @xmath16 a known function of @xmath17 proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "note that @xmath18 is of the form @xmath19 , so the reggeon amplitude is indeed @xmath13 , as claimed .",
    "although the reggeon amplitude is the dominant result for summing _ all _ diagrams in lla , it can be obtained just from the @xmath20-channel ladder diagrams and their gauge partners , because all the other diagrams are subdominant .",
    "we may therefore think of the reggeon as a composite object made up of gluons , bundled up together roughly in a ladder configuration .",
    "diffractive scattering occurs via a colour - singlet exchange .",
    "two or more reggeons are required to form a colour - singlet object in the @xmath20 channel .",
    "since each reggeon carries a small factor @xmath13 , the dominant singlet amplitude comes from two interacting reggeons , giving a magnitude @xmath21 .",
    "this is the bfkl pomeron @xcite .",
    "unfortunately this amplitude is not known too precisely , though one does know that in the forward direction and extremely high energies it behaves like @xmath22 , with @xmath23 a known number .",
    "this gives rise to a total cross section with energy variation @xmath24 , which violates the froissart bound @xmath25 .",
    "present data from hera @xcite on @xmath1 total cross section are consistent with a power growth in @xmath8 , though with an observed exponent smaller than @xmath26 computed from the bfkl pomeron .",
    "to satisfy unitarity and obey the froissart bound , the exponent must eventually decrease to zero at very high energies , and that can be achieved theoretically only by including subleading - log contributions that have been hitherto neglected .",
    "the first subleading correction to the bfkl pomeron have been computed @xcite , with the encouraging result of a smaller @xmath27 , but also with a pathological behaviour that has not yet been fully resolved . in any case",
    "the froissart bound is still violated .    from the @xmath8-channel unitarity relation 2im@xmath28 ,",
    "one expects all multiple - reggeon exchanges to have to be included before we can restore full unitarity and the froissart bound . as each additional reggeon brings in an extra factor of @xmath13 , they provide the required subleading - log contributions to all orders .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss a formalism whereby this scenario can be implemented in pqcd . for other approaches",
    "see for example @xcite .    to clarify what we have in mind ,",
    "let us first pretend the partons to be scattered through a two - body instantaneous potential @xmath29 .",
    "born amplitude alone violates unitarity , but that can be fixed up by including all higher - order corrections . for small @xmath30 , these higher - order terms are the analogs of the subleading contributions discussed above . these amplitudes can be summed up at high energy into an eikonal formula ( see eq .  )",
    "@xcite where unitarity is restored .",
    "dynamics is now specified by the phase shift @xmath31 , which is a function of the impact parameter @xmath32 , and is linear in @xmath30 .",
    "higher - order amplitudes can be recovered by expanding the exponential into powers of the phase shift .",
    "a very similar scenario emerged if the two partons interacted through a multiple exchange of photons . in that case",
    "the interaction is no longer instantaneous , and cross diagrams are present . in terms of the unitarity relation",
    ", this means photons are present in the intermediate states and the inelastic channels in which they are produced must be included in the unitarity sum .",
    "however , the eikonal form can still be established with the help of the ` eikonal formula ' @xcite , and the phase shift is still given by the born approximation amplitude ( the coulomb phase shift ) @xcite .",
    "there is nothing new about using the eikonal form to implement unitarity .",
    "in fact , a very large amount of phenomenology of two - body scattering has been carried out in that framework .",
    "the modern challenge is whether , and if so how , pqcd amplitudes can be unitarized that way . for on - shell near - forward hadronic scatterings , confinement is presumably important and we may not even be able to use pqcd . however , @xmath1 total cross section at large virtuality is expected to be calculable in pqcd , and the bfkl pomeron is an attempt to do so .",
    "unfortunately it violates the froissart bound , so the implementation of unitarity in pqcd remains unsolved .",
    "this is the area where we hope to make some progress on .",
    "the main difficulty comes from the fact that terms with all powers of @xmath7 ( with fixed @xmath6 ) are needed to restore unitarity , but these are small terms extremely difficult to obtain from feynman diagrams in the calculable regime @xmath33 .    the following physical picture @xcite may help to visualize how the froissart bound is restored .",
    "the rise of total cross section @xcite predicted by the bfkl pomeron @xcite may be attributed to an increased production of gluon jets at higher energies .",
    "when the energy gets really high , there are so many gluons around that they tend to overlap one another .",
    "when that happens , coherent effect becomes important and a destructive interference sets in to reduce the power growth , to a rate that eventually satisfies the froissart bound @xmath25 .",
    "this mechanism suggests that whatever formalism we use to restore the froissart bound , interference effects ought to be a central part of it .",
    "the ` nonabelian cut diagrams ' we propose to use to solve this problem fits into this category , because they can be viewed as a way to organize the summation of feynman diagrams to heighten the bose - einstein interference effects of identical gluons @xcite .",
    "returning to the formal mechanism to unitarize qcd , the first thought would be to try to imitate potential scattering and qed by including multiple exchanges of reggeons and/or pomerons .",
    "this is indeed the general idea but there are non - trivial problems to be solved with this approach .",
    "unlike the photon in qed or the potential , reggeon and pomeron are composite objects , themselves made up of gluons and possibly quark pairs .",
    "it is therefore not clear whether we are allowed to exchange them as if they were elementary .",
    "for example , should we include diagrams where reggeons are crossed ? or equivalently , can reggeons be produced from the partons so that inelastic channels involving their production must be included in the unitarity sum like qed ? can these composite objects overlap and merge ? if an effective theory of reggeon / pomeron equivalent to qcd existed without gluons , then presumably we would be able to answer all these questions once its precise dynamics is known .",
    "however , since gluons can be produced off reggeons and pomerons , they must be included in any effective theory @xcite , in which case it is hard to exclude them from being exchanged as well .",
    "if we have to exchange gluons anyhow , we might as well go back to the original qcd theory which exchanges nothing but gluons and quarks , and whose dynamics is precisely known .",
    "at least we can avoid potential double counting if we do it that way .",
    "nevertheless , gluon self - interaction and non - commutativity of colour matrices have no analog in the potential or the qed problem , so it is not clear how the very complicated qcd feynman diagrams can be handled .",
    "it is even less certain that the results can be mimicked by the exchange of reggeons and/or pomerons which we hope to see .",
    "worst of all , feynman diagrams can hardly be calculated beyond lla , but we need subleading contributions to build up the eikonal form and unitarity .",
    "how can we possibly get them without going through the impossible task of computing feynman diagrams to highly subleading orders ?    fortunately these questions can be answered and difficulties overcome , if we use the nonabelian cut diagrams introduced elsewhere @xcite instead of the conventional feynman diagrams .",
    "reggeons and pomerons emerge naturally , and phase shifts can be calculated using only the leading - log approximation . due to the possibility of gluon production from reggeons ,",
    "phase shift is generally no longer linear in the ( reggeon ) exchange , as was the case in potential scattering and qed .",
    "nonabelian cut diagrams will be reviewed in secs .  3 and 4 .",
    "they are feynman diagrams with slightly different ` feynman rules ' .",
    "a permuted sum of feynman diagrams can be shown to be equal to a permuted sum of ( nonabelian ) cut diagrams , which is why we may calculate amplitudes using either of them .",
    "the main advantage of cut diagram is that identification with reggeon becomes natural .",
    "in fact , each cut amplitude is given by a product of reggeon ( fragment ) amplitudes .",
    "this factorization allows the eikonal form to be built up , and subleading terms to be computed just in the leading - log approximations .",
    "we have used the word _ reggeon fragment amplitudes _ to mean finite - order amplitudes whose sum builds up the full reggeon amplitude . hence the word ` fragment ' .",
    "there may be many distinct fragments even at a given order . for brevity ,",
    "the word ` fragment ' will often be dropped .    in sec .  2 ,",
    "the impact - parameter representation of a high - energy two - body amplitude is reviewed .",
    "a physical argument is given to show how the froissart bound is restored when the bound - violating born approximation is iterated and summed up into an eikonal form . in sec .",
    "3 , nonabelian factorization formula @xcite and nonabelian cut diagrams @xcite for tree amplitudes are reviewed ; nonabelian cut diagrams are simply feynman diagrams with the factorization formula built in .",
    "it is important to note that this factorization has nothing to do with the usual factorization of hard physics from soft physics @xcite .",
    "the present one goes along the @xmath8-channel , whereas the usual one goes along the @xmath20-channel . in sec .  4 ,",
    "the technique is applied to two - body scattering amplitudes .",
    "the advantage of using cut diagram over feynman diagram to compute a permuted sum is discussed .",
    "the connection with reggeons is identified .",
    "the question of factorizability of these amplitudes into irreducible parts is discussed in sec .",
    "this factorization allows the eikonal form to be built up and phase shifts computed from the irreducible amplitudes .",
    "diffractive scattering is considered in sec .",
    "6 . in that case phase shift may be restricted to those obtained from one and two irreducible reggeon exchanges , and can be computed from the lla - reggeon and bfkl - pomeron amplitudes . by using phase shifts in the eikonal form unitarization of the diffractive amplitude",
    "is achieved . to illustrate the details of previous sections , quark - quark scattering amplitudes and phase shifts",
    "are given to the three - loop order in sec .",
    "8 is devoted to the observed @xmath1 total cross sections .",
    "we argue that the dependence of the energy - growth exponent on virtuality @xmath0 , as well as the size of the bfkl exponent compared to the observed ones , can be taken as indications that the softening of energy growth towards the froissart - bound limit is already happening .",
    "correct energy dependence at various virtuality @xmath0 can be reproduced with the formulae of sec .",
    "7 . finally , appendix a contains some colour - algebra calculations .",
    "let @xmath34 be a parton - parton scattering amplitude at centre - of - mass energy @xmath5 and momentum transfer @xmath35 . at high energies",
    "@xmath36 is transverse , and conjugate to the impact - parameter @xmath37 .",
    "bold letters like @xmath36 and @xmath37 are used to describe vectors in the transverse plane .",
    "the two - dimensional fourier transform of @xmath34 defines the impact - parameter amplitude @xmath38 by the eikonal formula a(s,)=2isd^2e^i.(s , b)2isd^2e^i.@xmath39 . for large @xmath40 ,",
    "angular momentum is given by @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is just the phase shift at that angular momentum . for qcd parton scatterings , the initial and final partons may contain different colours , so the amplitudes @xmath34 and @xmath38 , as well as the phase shift @xmath43 , should be treated as colour matrices .",
    "only the diagonal matrix elements arising from a colour - singlet exchange are truly elastic amplitudes .",
    "we shall denote them by @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in terms of them , the total cross section @xmath46 is given by the optical theorem to be _ t(s)=1sim@xmath47 .",
    "no approximation has been made to arrive at , so unitarity is exact and the froissart bound is satisfied . if @xmath42 is small , the exponential may be expanded and only the term linear in @xmath43 kept .",
    "this gives the ` born amplitude ' and allows the phase shift to be thought of as the ` potential ' .",
    "thus if the interaction causing the scattering has a range @xmath48 , then we expect @xmath49 . at large impact parameters",
    ", @xmath50 may be taken to be approximately independent of @xmath32 . in the region",
    "@xmath51 , the phase shift is small and the impact amplitude @xmath38 in ceases to contribute .",
    "the effective radius @xmath52 of interaction may therefore be estimated from the condition @xmath53 .",
    "if @xmath50 is an increasing function of @xmath8 , then @xmath52 and hence @xmath54 also increase with @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath55 has a power growth , caused for example by the exchange of a spin @xmath23 pomeron or elementary particle , then @xmath56\\ln s$ ] , and @xmath57 , which is the froissart bound .",
    "this conclusion is general and is qualitatively independent of the magnitude of @xmath27 and the range @xmath48 .",
    "unless @xmath50 increases faster than a power of @xmath8 , the froissart bound is guaranteed when total cross - sections are calculated from the phase shift . on the other hand ,",
    "if we used the ` born approximation ' throughout , then the total cross section would have grown like @xmath24 all the way , and the froissart bound would be violated .",
    "this is essentially what happens to the bfkl pomeron @xcite .",
    "the cure , very roughly speaking , is to use it as a phase shift rather than an amplitude .",
    "this is the general idea but details are more complicated .",
    "they will be discussed in sec .",
    "6 .    to make use of this unitarization mechanism we must find a way to calculate the phase shift",
    "this is not simple for several reasons . according to ,",
    "even when @xmath42 is computed just to the lowest order , the resulting @xmath34 contains terms of all orders .",
    "this suggests that a proper understanding of phase shifts can not be obtained until we know how to sum an infinite number of feynman diagrams . to put it differently",
    ", we have to learn how to deal with @xmath58 , which consists of an infinite sum of all powers of the matrix amplitude @xmath38 .    moreover , according to , to be successful a certain product structure must emerge out of the sum .",
    "if the phase shift is expanded in powers of the coupling constant @xmath59 , @xmath60 , then the @xmath61th order contribution to @xmath38 is given by a sum of products of the phase shifts @xmath62 , with @xmath63 .",
    "individual feynman diagrams certainly do not factorize in this manner , and it is not immediately clear why sums of feynman diagrams have this structure either .",
    "but unless we can get the sum into this factorized form there would seem to be no simple way to extract the phase shift from feynman diagrams .    in the next two sections we shall lay down the foundation which enables us to build up such a factorized form .",
    "the decomposition of sums of feynman diagrams into sums of products of reggeon amplitudes , or of phase shifts , is based on a nonabelian _ factorization formula _ @xcite .",
    "this formula for tree amplitudes is the nonabelian generalization of the _ eikonal formula _",
    "@xcite used in high - energy scattering in qed .",
    "it can be conveniently embedded into feynman diagrams to turn them into _ nonabelian cut diagrams _",
    ". these items will be reviewed in the present section .",
    "the formula deals with a sum of tree amplitudes like fig .  1",
    ", in which a fast particle of final momentum @xmath64 emerges from an initial particle with momentum @xmath65 after the emission of @xmath66 gluons of momenta @xmath67 .",
    "spins and vertex factors are ignored in this section but they will be incorporated later . the gluons concerned need not be on shell .",
    "this allows the tree diagram to be a part of a much larger feynman diagram , so that formulae developed for trees here are also useful for more complicated diagrams later .",
    "we shall assume the energy @xmath68 of the fast particle to be much larger than its mass @xmath69 , its transverse momentum @xmath35 , the square - root virtuality @xmath70 in case it is present , and all the components @xmath67 of every gluon momentum ; in short , larger than any other energy scale involved .",
    "it is convenient to use a somewhat unconventional system in which the final particle moves along the z - axis . in the light - cone coordinates defined by @xmath71 , the final four - momentum of the energetic particle can then be written as @xmath72 , where terms of @xmath73 have been dropped .",
    "the initial momentum @xmath65 of the fast particle then carries a transverse component @xmath74 . in the _ eikonal approximation _",
    "outlined above , = 12pk+k^2+i can be made on all propagators of the fast particle , provided @xmath75 is the sum of any number of the @xmath76 s .",
    "the factor @xmath77 in is irrelevant for the rest of this section so it will be dropped and the propagators taken simply to be @xmath78 .    the tree amplitude in fig .  1",
    "is then given by the product of a momentum factor @xmath79 $ ] and a colour factor @xmath80 $ ] , where a[]&=&-2i@xmath81 _ i=1^n-11_j=1^ik^-_i+i , + t[]&=&t_1t_2t_3t_n .",
    "the @xmath82-function in @xmath79 $ ] is there to ensure the initial - state momentum @xmath83 to be on shell , for in the eikonal approximation its square is @xmath84 .",
    "since this @xmath82-function is not explicitly contained in the t - matrix , it should be removed at the end , but for the sake of a simple statement in the factorization formula below it is convenient to include it in @xmath79 $ ] for now .",
    "the colour factor @xmath80 $ ] is given by a product of @xmath85 colour matrices @xmath86 in the representation appropriate to the fast particle .",
    "since gluons obey bose - einstein statistics , we must sum over all their permutations to obtain the complete tree amplitude .",
    "let @xmath87=[\\s_1\\s_2 \\cdots\\s_n]$ ] indicate the ordering of gluons along the fast particle from left to right .",
    "this symbol will also be used to denote the corresponding tree diagram . in this notation fig .",
    "1 corresponds to @xmath87=[\\tilde\\s]\\equiv[123\\cdots n]$ ] .",
    "the tree amplitude for the diagram @xmath87 $ ] will be denoted by @xmath88t[\\s]$ ] ; they are given by with appropriate permutation of the gluon momenta .",
    "the complete tree amplitude is given by the sum of individual tree amplitudes over the @xmath89 permutations @xmath87 $ ] of the permutation group @xmath90 .",
    "the _ factorization formula _",
    "@xcite states that this permuted sum can be replaced by a similar sum of the _ nonabelian cut amplitudes _ : _ [ ] s_na[]t[]=_[]s_na[_c]t[_c ] .",
    "just like the amplitudes on the left - hand side which can be obtained from feynman diagrams , the ( nonabelian ) cut amplitudes @xmath91t[\\s_c']$ ] on the right - hand side can be obtained from _",
    "nonabelian cut diagrams_@xcite .",
    "the ( nonabelian ) cut diagrams are feynman diagrams with cuts inserted at the appropriate propagators .",
    "the ` feynman rules ' for cut diagrams are the usual ones except at and around the cut propagators , as we shall explain .",
    "the position of the cuts depends on @xmath87 $ ] , and is given by the following rule . _",
    "a cut is placed just to the right of gluon @xmath92 if and only if @xmath93 for all @xmath94_. we shall label a cut by a vertical bar , either on the diagram itself or in the corresponding permutation symbol @xmath87 $ ] .",
    "the resulting nonabelian cut diagram will be denoted by @xmath95 $ ] .",
    "for example , if @xmath87=[32145]$ ] , then @xmath95=[321|4|5]$ ] .",
    "if @xmath87=[12354]$ ] , then @xmath95=[1|2|3|54]$ ] .",
    "the momentum factor of a cut amplitude , @xmath91 $ ] , is obtained from the momentum factor @xmath88 $ ] of the feynman amplitude by replacing the feynman propagator @xmath78 of every cut line by the cutkosky propagator @xmath96 .",
    "there is then a superficial similarity between a cutkosky cut diagram and a nonabelian cut diagram .",
    "however , they are completely different and the cut diagrams referred to in this paper are exclusively nonabelian cut diagrams .    from",
    ", it follows that @xmath91 $ ] is factorized into products of @xmath50 s separated by cuts , which is why the formula is called the _ factorization _ formula .",
    "for example , if @xmath95=[321|4|5]$ ] , then @xmath91=a[321]a[4]a[5]$ ] .",
    "we mentioned below eq .   that the @xmath82-function appearing in the amplitude must be removed at the end",
    "this can be carried out by putting in cutkosky propagators _ only _ where a vertical bar occurs .",
    "the overall @xmath82-fucntion for the sum of the ` @xmath97 ' components of momenta then disappears because no cut is ever put after the last entry @xmath98 of @xmath87=[\\s_1\\s_2\\cdots\\s_n]$ ] .",
    "the _ complementary cut diagram _ ( or c - cut diagram for short ) @xmath99 $ ] of a cut diagram @xmath95 $ ] is one in which every cut line in @xmath95 $ ] becomes uncut , and vice versa .",
    "if no cuts appear in @xmath100 $ ] , the colour factor @xmath101 $ ] is simply the product of colour matrices , as in a feynman diagram .",
    "when cuts are present , the product straddling an isolated cut is replaced by its commutator .",
    "if consecutive cuts occur , then the product is replaced by nested multiple commutators .",
    "for example , if @xmath87=[32145]$ ] , then @xmath95= [ 321|4|5]$ ] , @xmath100=[3|2|145]$ ] , and @xmath101=[t_3,[t_2,t_1]]t_4t_5 $ ] .    for @xmath102 ,",
    ".   reads @xmath103t[12]+a[21]t[21]= a[1|2]t[12]+a[21]t[2|1]=a[1]a[2]t_1t_2+a[21][t_2,t_1]$ ] .",
    "this can easily be checked by direct calculation .",
    "explicit check for @xmath104 is also possible @xcite , but for larger @xmath66 a direct verification becomes very complicated .",
    "the factorization formula is combinatorial in nature , and is true whatever the matrices @xmath105 are . in particular ,",
    "if all the matrices @xmath105 commute , as in qed , then the only surviving term on the right - hand side of is the one where no commutator occurs , which means that @xmath100 $ ] contains no cuts , and @xmath95 $ ] has a cut at each propagator .",
    "this implies factorization of the tree amplitude into a single product @xmath106 $ ] , which is the usual eikonal formula @xcite used in qed scatterings .",
    "it is this factorization that allows exponentiation to occur and the phase shift to be computed .",
    "in qcd , colour matrices do not commute , = if_abct_c , but their commutators generate other colour matrices .",
    "this allows the nested multiple commutator of colour matrices to be interpreted as a source for a new _ adjoint - colour _ object , which we call a _",
    "reggeon fragment_. for parton - parton scattering in the weak coupling limit , they turn out to be the constituents of the reggeon as we know it from the regge - pole theory , hence the name .",
    "the word ` fragment ' is there to clarify that this object is just part of the reggeon , not the whole thing , but for brevity this word is often dropped .",
    "this algebraic characterization of a reggeon is valid even in the strong coupling limit , or physical situations other than two - parton scatterings . unlike a gluon which is a point - like particle",
    ", a reggeon is an extended object made up of a bundle of gluons , each interacting with the energetic particle at a different point .",
    "later we may also introduce interactions between gluons to tie them together .",
    "note that there are at least as many distinct reggeon fragments as there are nested multiple commutators . with this interpretation ,",
    "the cut amplitude @xmath91t[\\s_c']$ ] is nothing but a product of @xmath107 such reggeon amplitudes , with @xmath108 being the number of cuts in @xmath95 $ ] .    two final remarks .",
    "first , the rule of inserting cuts explained above depends on how the gluons are labelled , though at the end of the calculation it should clearly not matter how it is done .",
    "we may adopt the labelling which is most convenient for our purpose .",
    "secondly , we have assumed the fast particle to carry a large ` + ' component of the light - cone momentum , but we may equally well construct cut diagrams if it had a large ` @xmath97 ' component instead . for parton - parton scattering , both are required .",
    "we will study two - body amplitudes in this section using cut diagrams .",
    "cut diagrams are easier to compute than the corresponding feynman diagrams , @xmath9 cancellations occuring in permuted sum of feynman diagrams do not happen in this case , and they are directly related to the reggeon ( fragment ) amplitudes",
    ". these are some of the advantages of using cut diagrams .",
    "2 depicts a qcd feynman diagram for the scattering of two energetic partons .",
    "the upper one carries an incoming momentum @xmath109 in light - cone coordinates , and the lower one carries an incoming momentum @xmath110 .",
    "suppose there are @xmath111 gluons attached to the upper parton and @xmath112 to the lower , then the @xmath113 diagrams obtained by permuting the position of attachment forms a _ permuted set _ of diagrams .",
    "the sum of amplitudes for diagrams in the permuted set will be called a _ premuted sum of amplitudes_. if we replace the feynman tree attached to each energetic parton by the corresponding cut tree , as in sec .  3",
    ", then we have a cut diagram .",
    "according to , a permuted sum of feynman amplitudes is equal to a permuted sum of cut amplitudes , which is why we may use cut diagrams instead of feynman diagrams for computation .",
    "however , when _ both _ parton trees are permuted we may overcount , in which case the final result has to be divided by a symmetry factor @xmath114 .",
    "this for example will happen to a permuted sum of @xmath8-channel ladder diagrams .",
    "if @xmath66 gluons are exchanged between the two energetic partons , then there are @xmath89 distinct diagrams by permutation .",
    "the permuted set however contains @xmath115 diagrams , because each distinct diagram appears @xmath89 times in the set .",
    "hence a symmetry factor @xmath116 is required for this case .",
    "the scattering amplitude depends on the centre - of - mass energy @xmath5 and the coupling constant @xmath117 , as well as the momentum transfer @xmath35 , and the virtuality @xmath0 if it is involved in deep inelastic scatterings .",
    "let us concentrate on its dependence on @xmath117 and @xmath8 for the moment .",
    "the born amplitude is @xmath118 .",
    "an @xmath119-loop feynman diagram is proportional to @xmath120 , but each loop may also ( though may not ) produce a factor of @xmath9 upon integration . in this way the amplitude may grow with energy as fast as @xmath121 , and there are diagrams doing so . in the notation of the introduction",
    ", this means that all amplitudes are bounded by @xmath13 .",
    "multi - loop feynman diagrams can usually be computed only in lla .",
    "when they are summed , their leading power of @xmath9 unfortunately cancels in most @xmath20-channel colour configurations .",
    "e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite for concrete examples .",
    "sometimes many subleading powers are cancelled as well . in the case of qed with multi - photon exchanges ,",
    "_ all _ @xmath122 powers are cancelled .",
    "this simply means that a non - zero sum can be obtained for these colour configurations only when individual feynman diagrams are computed to the appropriate subleading - log accuracy , which is generally quite an impossible thing to do .",
    "this disaster is avoided in cut diagrams @xcite .",
    "this is so because all cancellations to occur have already taken place in building the individual cut diagrams . at a cut line ,",
    "the feynman propagator is replaced by the cutkosky propagator @xmath96 .",
    "if a @xmath9 factor is to occur in the loop involving this feynman propagator , it comes from its singularity at @xmath123 through the integral @xcite _",
    "^2/sdk^-k^-+i~(s/^2 ) , where @xmath124 is determined by a mixture of the other scales ( @xmath125 ) in the problem , and can be either positive or negative . in lla the @xmath126 factor is dropped so its precise dependence becomes immaterial . when this feynman propagator is replaced by a cutkosky propagator , the integral becomes a constant , and the @xmath9 factor disappears .",
    "this corresponds to the cancellation of @xmath9 factors when feynman diagrams are summed , but here the cancellation has already taken place once the feynman propagator is changed into the cutkosky propagator , even before the high - energy limit is calculated .",
    "this is why it is sufficient to calculate each cut amplitude in lla .",
    "in contrast , if we first compute the high - energy limit from individual feynman diagrams before summing them , then cancellation occurs afterwards and each diagram has to be computed to a subleading - log accuracy .    by symmetry",
    "the same thing happens on the lower parton line .",
    "since a @xmath9 factor is lost for each cut on the upper parton line , or the lower ( but not both ) , the @xmath117 and @xmath8 dependence of a nonabelian cut amplitude with @xmath119 loops , @xmath127 cuts on top , and @xmath128 cuts at the bottom , is bounded by g^2ms(g^2s)^-m+1 , where @xmath129 . in other words , it is bounded by @xmath130 . since @xmath131 is also the number of adjoint - colour reggeons emitted from the upper ( lower ) parton ( see the discussion at the end of sec .",
    "3 ) , bounds with different @xmath107 apply to different reggeon ( or colour ) channels .",
    "it is this ability of the cut diagram to extract small contributions from large - colour channels that makes it so valuable for unitarization . with this extraction",
    "we can now afford to throw away even smaller contributions at the same colour .",
    "this is what we mean by the _ extended leading - log approximation _ (",
    "it differs from lla in that it keeps the leading contribution at every colour , no matter how small that is .    with ella and @xmath20-channel colour conservation ,",
    "reggeon number is conserved . in other words",
    ", we can ignore diagrams with @xmath132 .",
    "this is so because the colour being exchanged must be contained both in the product of @xmath133 adjoint colours , _ and _ the product of @xmath134 adjoint colours .",
    "if @xmath135 , say , then there is another diagram , with @xmath136 , that possesses all these colours that are allowed , but with an amplitude @xmath137 which dominates over the present one whose amplitude is @xmath138 . hence diagrams with @xmath132 can be dropped in ella .",
    "this cut amplitude , with magnitude @xmath130 and generated by the exchange of @xmath107 adjoint - colour objects , is just the @xmath107-reggeon ( fragment ) amplitude .",
    "when all the fragments are summed up it becomes the usual @xmath107-reggeon amplitude .",
    "in particular , this shows that the most dominant comes from a one - reggeon exchange and is @xmath13 , agreeing with what we know by direct calculation @xcite .",
    "we shall discuss in the next section the factorization of reggeon ( fragment ) amplitudes .",
    "we shall consider in this section factorization of reggeon ( fragment ) amplitudes into irreducible amplitudes .",
    "this factorization enables all amplitudes to be summed up into an eikonal form , and phase shift expressed as the sum of all irreducible reggeon ( fragment ) amplitudes .",
    "we will call a feynman diagram _ reducible _ , if it falls into @xmath139 disconnected parts after the two energetic - parton lines are removed .",
    "for example , both fig .  3 and fig .",
    "4 are both reducible .",
    "they have @xmath140 irreducible parts if each of a , b , c is irreducible .",
    "a similar definition will be used for cut diagrams , except that all consecutive uncut gluon lines must be merged into single reggeon lines before the two energetic partons are removed .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "5 has three irreducible parts but fig .",
    "6 has only two .",
    "every member in a permuted set of feynman diagrams has the same number @xmath141 of irreducible components , but this is not so in a permuted set of cut diagrams as evident from the example above .    in every permuted set",
    "there is at least one member diagram which is _ uncrossed_.",
    "this means the gluon lines from different irreducible components do not cross one another . for example , figs .",
    "3 and 5 are uncrossed diagrams , and figs .  4 and 6 are crossed .",
    "for reducible diagrams with @xmath141 distinct components , there are actually @xmath142 uncrossed diagrams obtained by permuting the relative positions of these components .    to discuss factorization we must first discuss how to construct and to organize the cut diagrams in a systematic way .",
    "we will do so by induction on the order @xmath66 , assuming that we already know how to do it for all orders less than @xmath66 .    in this connection",
    "the remark made in the last paragraph of sec .",
    "3 about the labelling of gluon lines is relevant .",
    "the labelling can be assigned arbitrarily for one diagram in a permuted set , after which the location of cuts in any other diagram of the set is completely determined .",
    "we shall choose our labellings to facilitate factorization .",
    "consider any permuted set of diagrams .",
    "if @xmath143 , there is no question of factorization so we just label the gluon lines anyway we want to .",
    "if @xmath139 , we will choose to fix the labelling from an uncrossed diagram , such as figs .",
    "3 . if there are @xmath144 gluons in part a , @xmath145 in part b , etc . , then label the gluons in part a by the numbers 1 to @xmath144 , and those in part b by the numbers @xmath146 to @xmath147 , etc .",
    "this labelling ensures cuts to occur between any two irreducible components , as in fig .",
    "the labelling within each irreducible component is assumed to have been fixed before , and it is correlated with the location of cuts inside these components .",
    "5 shows one labelling that gives rise to the cuts shown .    with cuts between irreducible components ,",
    "the amplitude of the uncrossed cut diagram factorizes in the impact - parameter space , ( s , b)=-2is_j@xmath148 , where @xmath149 is the colour factor of the @xmath150th irreducible component .",
    "the order of @xmath149 in the product follows the order of the irreducible components in the uncrossed diagram . to see why we have to go to the impact - parameter space for factorization , and to understand the detailed numerical factors appearing in ,",
    "let us briefly review the feynman rules used to construct the @xmath151-matrix .",
    "feynman propagators are taken to be @xmath152 , with @xmath153 respectively for scalars , spinors , and gauge bosons .",
    "vertex factors are taken directly from the coefficients of the interacting lagrangians .",

    ", we have a factor @xmath157 per loop .",
    "let @xmath158 be the loop momentum of any loop containing a cut on top and a cut at the bottom .",
    "the loop integration for the impact - parameter amplitude , taken the top and the bottom cutkosky propagators into account , becomes -ie^i*q*. ( -2i)^2(q^- ) ( q^+)=i2s e^i .. the factor @xmath159 in the denominator of is cancelled by the factor @xmath159 from a pair of vertices . since there is one less loop than pairs of vertices present , an extra factor @xmath159 remains , which is shown in in front of the product sign .",
    "this leaves the factor @xmath154 per loop in , which accounts for all the @xmath154 factors in .",
    "finally , transverse momentum conservation links the irreducible components together , preventing factorization to occur .",
    "but if we fourier - transform it into impact - parameter space , then the exponential factors @xmath160 separate , enabling factorization to take place as shown in .",
    "once the labelling of gluon lines is fixed this way in the uncrossed diagram , the location of cuts in any other cut diagram within the permuted set is completely determined .",
    "a diagram in this set may come from permutation of lines within irreducible components , in which case it involves only lower - order diagrams and by the induction hypothesis we do not have to worry about it .",
    "that leaves diagrams whose gluon lines from different components cross one another , as in fig .",
    "such crossed lines always fuse together some irreducible components and reduce their total number from @xmath141 to a number @xmath161 . if @xmath162 , this is simply a new irreducible component .",
    "if @xmath163 , then each irreducible component is of order @xmath164 , so it must have been included already in a lower - order consideration . in any case , the factorization formula is still valid , so every cut amplitude can be factorized into a product of irreducible reggeon amplitudes .",
    "a permuted set of feynman diagrams with @xmath141 irreducible components has @xmath142 uncross diagrams , corresponding to the different ordering of the components .",
    "we could have fixed the labelling using any of these .",
    "for example , we could fix the labelling from fig .",
    "7(a ) , getting the cuts shown there , ( the thick lines are reggeon lines , _ i.e. , _ a group of gluon lines with no cuts between them ) , or we could have fixed the labelling from fig .",
    "7(b ) . the former factorize into something proportional to @xmath165 , and",
    "the latter is proportional to @xmath166 . since the colour matrices do not commute these two are not the same",
    ". which one should we use ?",
    "it turns out that within ella it does not matter . either will do and they give effectively the same amplitude , because their difference is an amplitude that can be neglected in ella",
    "this is so because the difference is proportional to the commutator @xmath167 $ ] .",
    "using jacobi identity , commutator of two nested multiple commutators can be written as sums of nested multiple commutators .",
    "so the difference of figs .",
    "7(a ) and 7(b ) is given by cut diagrams with one less reggeon line , say @xmath108 instead of @xmath107 , which means that the spacetime amplitude @xmath130 of these diagrams is negigible compared to the leading contribution @xmath168 for amplitudes with @xmath108 reggeons .    summing up all permuted sets of cut diagrams of all orders",
    ", we obtain the complete impact - space amplitude in ella to be ( s , b)=2is@xmath169 , where the sum is taken over all irreducible reggeon fragment amplitudes . by comparing this with the formula in ,",
    "we deduce immediately the formula for phase shift to be 2(s , b)=_jh_j(s , b)_j .",
    "we may combine all the irreducible amplitudes with the same @xmath20-channel colour @xmath50 to write the phase shift as 2(s , b)=_ad_a(s , b)_a , where @xmath170 is the colour factor for irreducible colour @xmath50 .",

    "let @xmath176 be the smallest integer required for irreducible colour @xmath50 to appear in the product of @xmath176 adjoint representations ( @xmath177 , etc . ) .",
    "then @xmath178 , and contribution to this colour from larger number of reggeons can be omitted .    for quark - quark scattering",
    "only adjoint and singlet colours can be exchanged , its phase shift is therefore given by ( s , b)=_8(s , b)+_1(s , b)=d_8(s , b)+d_1(s , b)1 .",
