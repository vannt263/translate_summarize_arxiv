    "in the droplet model of spin glasses ( sg)@xcite , the equilibrium dynamics is governed by low energy excitations from the ground state ( droplets ) .",
    "if a weak magnetic field - weak enough not to affect the system - is applied , the equilibrium system is magnetized via polarization of droplets of ever increasing size . however , the droplet model sg phase is chaotic@xcite in the sense that the equilibrium configuration is unstable to any temperature change @xmath5 ( or change in the distribution of the interaction ) and thus has to rearrange after such a perturbation .",
    "for example , after a quench from the paramagnetic phase into the spin glass phase the system is trapped in a random non - equilibrium spin configuration which slowly equilibrates ( ages ) .",
    "the aging occurs via droplet excitations which equilibrate the spin configuration on larger and larger length scales , causing the spin glass correlation length to grow .",
    "also , the equilibrium configurations at two different temperatures @xmath6 and @xmath7 are only different on large length scales , outside an overlap region . + it is observed experimentally that if an equilibrium sg configuration is imprinted up to a certain length scales ( age ) by keeping the spin glass a certain time at constant temperature , this length scale is conserved even though new configurations on shorter length scales are imprinted at other ( lower ) temperatures .",
    "manifestations of memory and chaos in spin glasses have been observed in the relaxation and temperature dependence of the low frequency ac - susceptibility in thermal protocols containing halts at constant temperature@xcite , as well as in temperature cycling experiments@xcite .",
    "in addition , signatures of memory and chaos have been demonstrated in simple dc - magnetization vs. temperature measurements@xcite on a standard rkky spin glass , ag(mn ) . in the present",
    "report the model 3d ising spin - glass , fe@xmath0mn@xmath1tio@xmath2 , is investigated using dc - magnetization experiments .",
    "the temperature dependence , as well as the relaxation of the zero field cooled ( zfc ) magnetization is recorded after specific cooling protocols . the results evidence memory and chaos phenomena in agreement with the predictions from the droplet model for the chaotic sg phase .",
    "the zfc magnetization of a single crystal of fe@xmath0mn@xmath1tio@xmath2 was recorded versus temperature and time in a non - commercial low - field squid magnetometer@xcite .",
    "this spin glass is considered as a canonical short - range ising spin - glass@xcite , with a sg transition temperature @xmath8 @xmath9 22 k. in the experiments , the cooling of the sample was interrupted by stop(s ) at constant temperature . in the case of single stop experiments ( sse ) ,",
    "the sample was first rapidly cooled in zero magnetic field from a reference temperature @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath8 down to the stop temperature @xmath3 @xmath12 @xmath8 , where it was kept for @xmath13=3000s ( and other durations ) .",
    "the cooling was then resumed down to the lowest temperature where the magnetic field @xmath14=1 oe was applied , and the magnetization recorded on re - heating . in the double stops experiments ( dse ) case , an equally long second temperature stop was made at @xmath4 @xmath12 @xmath3 .",
    "a reference curve was recorded after direct cooling of the sample to the lowest temperature .",
    "+ the same cooling protocols were employed in the relaxation measurements . after re - heating to the measurement temperature @xmath15 , and a wait time of @xmath16=10s , a magnetic field @xmath17=2 oe was applied , and the magnetization recorded vs. time elapsed after the field application . in the sse protocol , a 3000s stop was made a @xmath3=@xmath15 - the experiment is thus comparable to a short negative temperature cycling - while in the dse , two 3000s stops were made at @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xmath12 @xmath3 , and the relaxation measured at both @xmath15=@xmath3 and @xmath15=@xmath4 .",
    "reference measurements ( re ) were performed at @xmath15 by cooling the sample directly to the lowest temperature , and recording @xmath18 vs. time in @xmath17=2 oe after re - heating the sample to @xmath15 and employing the wait time of @xmath16=10s .",
    "`` conventional '' zfc relaxation measurements , in which the sample was only rapidly cooled to @xmath15 , with @xmath16=3000s , were performed for comparison and to ensure that the magnitude of the field was low enough to give a linear response@xcite from the system .",
    "+ the dc magnetic field was applied along the @xmath19-axis of the single - crystal .",
    "it is generated by a small superconductive solenoid coil working in persistent mode during measurements .",
    "the time constant of the superconducting magnet is of order 1 ms , but the whole procedure to change the field from @xmath14 to @xmath20 and re - establish persistent mode in the magnet takes @xmath9 0.2 s which also determines the shortest observation time in the relaxation experiments . apart from the stops at constant temperature , the cooling rate was @xmath9 4k / min , and the heating rate of the order of 1k / min .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] illustrates the effects on the zfc magnetization of a stop at constant temperature during the cooling . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , the curve corresponding to the sse experiments lies significantly below the reference one .",
    "this shows that when the system is left unperturbed at constant temperature @xmath3 it rearranges its spin configuration toward the equilibrium one for this temperature .",
    "the equilibrated state becomes frozen in on further cooling , and is retrieved on re - heating . in other terms , the system remembers its age or shows a memory phenomenon .",
    "it should be mentioned that the weak magnetic field only acts as a weak perturbation and has basically no influence on the intrinsic equilibration ( aging ) of the spin configuration at @xmath3 .",
    "similar effects would be obtained for example with an ac - field@xcite ( as in conventional memory experiments ) or when keeping a non - zero magnetic field when performing the stop@xcite .",
    "this will also be evidenced in the relaxation measurements described below .",
    "[ fig1](b ) presents the difference curves obtained by subtracting from the reference the sse curves obtained for different stop times @xmath13 .",
    "the stop times are chosen logarithmically spaced , and one immediately observes that the minimum of the different curves are closely equidistant from each other in magnitude , indicating logarithmic relaxation . the advantage of the dc - method to expose fundamental sg features in this simple way has also been demonstrated for other glassy systems@xcite .",
    "+ the effects of two stops during cooling are now studied .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the results of dse at @xmath21=21k and @xmath22=17k .",
    "the main frame shows the difference plots for the dse , as well as the corresponding sse .",
    "the inset depicts the original zfc magnetization curves before subtraction from the reference . comparing the dse curve with the corresponding sse ones in the main frame ,",
    "it is clear that the relaxation at @xmath21=21k is not affected by the second stop at lower temperature and reciprocally , the aging at @xmath22 is not influenced by the first equilibration at the higher temperature .",
    "this illustrates again the memory and temperature chaos features . during the first stop , the system reaches a characteristic age - or length scale",
    "this age is conserved on further cooling , even if the system is again aged at lower temperature toward its equilibrium state at this temperature@xcite .",
    "the state equilibrated at the higher temperature thus survives the spin re - configuration occurring at lower temperature on shorter length scales , and the system remembers its initial high temperature state on re - heating .",
    "of course , if the stop at lower temperature is performed for a much longer time , allowing the correlations to develop on longer length scales , a partial re - initialization of the spin configuration would occur , unmasking the two different length scales characteristic of the two aging processes@xcite .",
    "it is of interest to note that recent theoretical work@xcite based on the droplet picture in a chaotic landscape can reproduce the experimentally observed rejuvenation and memory phenomena .",
    "+ for comparison , the relaxation of the zfc magnetization is investigated using the same cooling protocols as in the @xmath18 vs. @xmath6 measurements .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the relaxation curves obtained at @xmath15=19k ( to compare with the single stop depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ) .",
    "the different curves are measured in an applied field of 2 oe according to the following protocols : * 1 * , no stop was made during cooling to the lowest temperature and the magnetic field was applied 10 s after @xmath15 was reached on re - heating ; * 2 * , additionally to procedure * 1 * a stop was made for 3000 s at @xmath15 during cooling and * 3 * , a conventional relaxation experiment at @xmath15 employing a wait time of 3000 s before applying the field .",
    "one notices that at observation times of @xmath910 - 30s ( corresponding to the effective observation time of the magnetization measurement on heating ) and longer , curve * 2 * lies significantly below curve * 1 * as is also the case for the sse magnetization compared to the no stop magnetization in fig .  [ fig1](a ) ) .",
    "it also shows that the sse curve is almost indistinguishable from the curve recorded on a 3000s old system in a `` conventional '' zfc relaxation measurement ( curve * 3 * ) . to illustrate the relative non - importance of the measurement field , the relaxation measurements illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) are repeated , but cooling the system in the field @xmath23=1 oe , and recording the magnetization with @xmath23 + 2 oe=3",
    "the additional field cooled ( fc ) relaxation is small@xcite , and as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , the results are virtually unaffected by the presence of an initial field during the cooling and equilibration time . + the dse shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] can also be mimicked by relaxation measurements , as illustrated in fig .",
    "curve * 1 * and * 2 * ( resp * 1b * and * 2b * ) correspond to sse at ( a)@xmath3=@xmath15=21k and ( b)@xmath3=@xmath15=17k .",
    "curve * 3 * and * 3b * correspond instead to the dse case , with stops at @xmath21=21k and @xmath22=17k , measuring the relaxation at ( a)@xmath15=21k or ( b)@xmath15=17k . as indicated in the @xmath18 vs. @xmath6 measurements , the relaxation after the sse and dse protocols are virtually identical , illustrating again chaos and memory characteristics of the spin glass phase .",
    "+ note on the relaxation measurements .",
    "looking again at fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , one notices that the relaxation dips created in the @xmath24 vs. @xmath6 curves are rather broad , which makes it difficult to repeat dse with closer stop temperatures . in that case , the relaxation experiments which are here used mainly to confirm the temperature dependent magnetization measurements , would yield more information on the interference and overlap effects@xcite .",
    "using simple dc - magnetization measurements , performed after specific cooling protocols , memory and temperature chaos features are revealed in an ising spin glass .",
    "the results are confirmed by relaxation measurements .",
    "it would be of interest to overcome the large@xcite overlap observed in monte carlo simulations and reproduce these results by studying the correlation function at some temperature , after equilibration at a higher one .",
