    "the classical nucleation theory ( cnt ) is the most widely used model for describing homogeneous nucleation and provides the nucleation rate as a function of the supersaturation ratio and the surface tension of a condensed phase@xcite .",
    "however , many studies have reported that the cnt fails to describe experimentally obtained results@xcite . in the case of water , the deviations between the nucleation rates predicted by the classical nucleation theory and the experimental values are in the order of @xmath6-@xmath7@xcite .",
    "the nucleation rates obtained by molecular dynamics ( md ) and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations also significantly differ from the predictions of the cnt@xcite .",
    "the nucleation rate is governed by the formation free energy of a critical cluster , which is the smallest thermodynamically stable cluster . in the classical nucleation theory ,",
    "the formation free energy is simply evaluated using the surface energy of the bulk material .",
    "since the critical clusters are considered to be nano - sized , the error in the classical theory is thought to come from the difference in the properties of such a small cluster and a bulk material .    in previous studies",
    ", there have been significant advances in theoretical models of homogeneous nucleation .",
    "one of the most successful and useful models is the semi - phenomenological ( sp ) model@xcite , which corrects the evaluation of the formation energy of a cluster in the cnt by using the second virial coefficient of a vapor . the predictions of the sp model agree well with experimental data for various substances including water@xcite . by performing md simulations of nucleation for lennard - jones systems , tanaka et al.@xcite tested the sp model and found that it also agrees well with their md simulations .",
    "however , only large supersaturation ratios were possible in their md simulations .",
    "recent large scale simulations by diemand et al.@xcite found some deviations in the nucleation rate from the sp model in the case of a small supersaturation ratio .    besides lennard - jones systems , many other md simulations examining the nucleation process of water molecules have been carried out .",
    "yasuoka and matsumoto@xcite investigated homogeneous nucleation for the first time using md simulations of water molecules .",
    "the nucleation rate they obtained at 350 k was two orders of magnitude less than that predicted by the classical theory .",
    "matsubara et al.@xcite carried out md simulations at various temperatures and supersaturation ratios , using a simple point charge / extended ( spc / e ) water model@xcite .",
    "they measured the nucleation rate , the critical nucleus size , and the formation free energy of a cluster and compared them with the various theoretical models .",
    "they showed that all theoretical models ( cnt , sp model , and the scaled model ) predict the nucleation rates obtained by the simulations to within one or two orders of magnitude . on the other hand ,",
    "the formation free energy of a cluster derived by the simulations was considerably larger than that obtained with the theoretical models .",
    "they showed that the deviations in the formation free energy can be explained by the larger growth rate of clusters than that assumed by the theories .",
    "recently , zipoli et al.@xcite developed a new coarse - grained model for water to study nucleation from the vapor and obtained smaller nucleation rates than the previous studies .",
    "in addition to the formation free energy of a cluster , the sticking probability @xmath8 of vapor molecules to clusters is another important factor for determining the nucleation rate .",
    "the sticking probability is usually assumed to be unity , despite the fact that the nucleation rate is proportional to @xmath8 in the nucleation theory . in the previous studies@xcite ,",
    "the sticking probability in a lennard - jones type system was examined through md simulations , by observing the growth rate of stable clusters larger than the critical size .",
    "they showed that the sticking probability decreases with decreasing supersaturation ratio ; however , the validity of their findings has not been confirmed .",
    "therefore , it is worthwhile investigating the sticking probability for various materials .    in the present study ,",
    "we performed md simulations of water molecules for a wide range of initial supersaturation ratios and temperatures .",
    "we observed the nucleation rates and derived the formation free energy by using the size distribution of the clusters . by comparing these numerical results with theories",

    "we also obtained the sticking probability from the md simulations based on the previous method@xcite .",

    "initially , the molecules are located randomly without being overlapped with others and the system is relaxed to be in the equilibrium state at 1000 k. using this initial condition , we started the simulations . in our simulations , the number of water molecules was not so large . in order to improve the statistical accuracy",

    "the simulation box contained 4000 water molecules and 4000 ( or 8000 ) argon carrier gas molecules to control the temperature . to compute the long - range electrostatic interactions",
    ", we adopted the reaction field - zero method@xcite in which a dielectric constant of infinity and a group - based cutoff are employed . in this study we set the cutoff radius to 3.5 nm .",

    ", we set the initial number density of molecules or the initial supersaturation ratio @xmath11 . the supersaturation ratio is defined as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the partial pressure of the monomers and the pressure in a saturated vapor .",
