    "while all attention is now focused on the large hadron collider ( lhc ) as a possible _ gold mine _ of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , one should not lose sight of other territories rich with new physics , e.g. , lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) rare decays , which could provide complementary information .",
    "ever since neutrino flavor mixing was established , interests for observing flavor violation in charged lepton decays have boomed .",
    "while in the neutrino sector flavor violation could be rather large ( maximal between @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) , in the charged lepton decays there is no sign of flavor violation as yet .",
    "the sm contributions to charged lfv decays are quite small , orders of magnitude below the current experimental sensitivity , due to the smallness of neutrino mass . hence , any observation of lfv processes in the charged lepton sector , which are being probed with ever increasing sensitivity , would unambiguously point to non - standard interactions . indeed",
    ", such indirect observations taken in isolation may not imply much on the exact nature of new physics .",
    "but a study of possible correlations of its effects on different independently measured charged lfv observables might provide a powerful cross - check and lead to identification of new physics through lhc / lfv synergy . in this paper",
    ", we consider @xmath0-parity violating ( rpv ) supersymmetry @xcite and perform a correlation analysis of its numerical impact on different lfv @xmath6 decays .",
    "we also study at tandem the rpv contribution to @xmath5 , an observable which continues to provide a @xmath20 room for new physics despite significantly improved theoretical and experimental accuracies .",
    "@xmath0-parity is a discrete symmetry , which is defined as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are the baryon number , lepton number and spin of a particle , respectively .",
    "@xmath0 is @xmath25 for all sm particles and @xmath26 for their superpartners .",
    "the usual assumption of @xmath22 and @xmath23 conservation in supersymmetric models are not supported by any deep underlying principle .",
    "the @xmath23-violating @xmath27-type superpotential is written as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 stands for su(2 ) doublet lepton superfields , @xmath30 for su(2 ) doublet quark superfields , @xmath31 for su(2 ) singlet down - type quark superfields , and @xmath32 are generation indices .",
    "there are 27 such @xmath27 couplings , on each of which and also on many of their combinations exist strong constraints @xcite .",
    "we select _ only two _ of them , namely @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and consider only them to be large and the rest to be either vanishing or negligibly small .    _",
    "why @xmath33 and @xmath34 _ ?",
    "it has been observed that these two couplings ( each with a magnitude of @xmath35 and for superparticle masses around 300 gev ) can justify the recently observed large @xmath3",
    "@xmath36 branching ratios that the sm can not explain @xcite . on top of that , if we turn on even a small @xmath37 , then together with @xmath38 , one can _ also _ explain the large phase in @xmath39@xmath40 mixing @xcite . turning our attention to the neutrino sector , we recall that generation of neutrino masses and mixing by @xmath27-type couplings usually require a specific combination of indices , namely , the @xmath41 product couplings @xcite .",
    "but if we take @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( together with @xmath42 as the only non - vanishing and large rpv couplings , a phenomenologically acceptable pattern of neutrino masses and mixing emerge at two - loop level @xcite . to sum up , we consider four non - vanishing rpv couplings : two of them @xmath33 and @xmath34 large ( @xmath35 ) and relevant for the present analysis , the other two @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( from charged - current universality @xcite ) not to be used in the present analysis but implicitly present to justify our choices of @xmath33 and @xmath34 through the correlated phenomena mentioned above .",
    "now , motivated by the observation of maximal mixing between @xmath18 and @xmath19 , we make a further assumption @xmath45 . keeping all these in mind",
    ", we outline our agenda as follows : consider @xmath33 and @xmath34 as the only two _ relevant _ rpv couplings ( the other two , viz .",
    "@xmath46 and @xmath47 , optional and small ) , assume them to be real , set their magnitudes equal and just enough to explain the @xmath3 anomaly , predict its effect on @xmath5 , and estimate its numerical impact on different lfv @xmath6 decays ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) .",
    "for simplicity , we assume all squark and slepton masses to be degenerate , and denote the common mass by @xmath52 .",
    "we derive various one - loop effective flavor violating vertices , which we have often referred to as _ form - factors_. we display their exact as well as approximate expressions . while for numerical plots we use the exact formulae , the approximate expressions serve to provide an intuitive feel of the numerical impact .",
    "the branching fraction of the leptonic decay @xmath3 ( @xmath54 ) is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the lifetime of @xmath8 . the decay constant is defined as @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the momentum of @xmath8 .",
    "the branching ratio has a helicity suppression factor characterized by @xmath59 on account of a spin - zero particle decaying into two spin - half particles .",
    "monte - carlo simulations of qcd on lattice predict @xmath60 mev @xcite .",
    "the experimental average is somewhat higher : @xmath61 mev @xcite .",
    "the enhancements are @xmath62 in the muon channel , @xmath63 in the tau channel , and @xmath64 on average . on the other hand , the lattice estimate and the experimentally obtained value for @xmath65 seem to be in perfect agreement around 206 mev @xcite .",
    "the latter suggests that the discrepancy in @xmath53 may very well be influenced by new physics contributing in a _ flavor specific way _ to @xmath8 decay .",
    "note that @xmath3 in the sm proceeds at tree level and it is cabibbo - allowed .",
    "hence , loop suppressed new physics is an unlikely candidate to account for the discrepancy .",
    "leptoquark or charged higgs interactions have been advocated in this context as they provide new tree amplitudes for the above decay @xcite .",
