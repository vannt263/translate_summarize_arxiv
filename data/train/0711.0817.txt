    "at leading twist , the internal structure of the nucleon can be described by three fundamental distribution functions .",
    "they are the unpolarized , the longitudinal and the transversity distribution functions .",
    "the former two have been well known , but the last one  transversity  @xcite , is less known both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "the difficulty lies in its chiral - odd property , which makes it inaccessible in inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) process .",
    "however , transversity can manifest itself through collins mechanism  @xcite in single hadron production where the chiral - odd distribution function ( df ) couples with an also chiral - odd fragmentation function ( ff ) , the so called collins function . by observing the single spin asymmetry ( ssa ) phenomena",
    ", we can extract the information on the transversity and the collins function .",
    "hermes collaboration  @xcite and compass collaboration  @xcite have already published their data , reporting their observation of the non - zero ssa .",
    "some work  @xcite has been done to extract the transversity and collins function from the data . in future , jlab ( jefferson laboratory ) has also planned to measure the transversity through the same process but with the @xmath0he target  @xcite .",
    "we expect further exploration to give more information .",
    "however , difficulty still exists for reliable measurements of transversity .",
    "since the transversity and the collins function always appear together in the single hadron production case , they in fact can not be directly measured independently .",
    "an alternative way to measure transversity is to detect two unpolarized leading hadrons in the final state , which was suggested first by collins , ladinsky , heppelmann  @xcite and then by jaffe , jin and tang  @xcite . in two hadron leptoproduction process",
    ", the transversity gets factorized at leading twist through a new chiral - odd ff , usually called the interference ff .",
    "the new introduced ff is still unknown yet , but it can be cleanly measured in @xmath1 annihilation at belle . until now ,",
    "hermes  @xcite and compass  @xcite have already published their preliminary data on two hadron production process with unpolarized beam and transversely polarized proton or deuteron target , which made a first step in understanding the new ff . on the theoretical side , some models have been put forward to calculate the interference ff for @xmath2 pair production  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , bacchetta and radici also gave their prediction at hermes and compass kinematics , using different parametrizations of transversity .",
    "in this paper , we will also give predictions on ssa both at hermes and compass kinematics and with various targets .",
    "for the interference ffs , we will adopt the parametrization provided by ref .",
    "@xcite , while for the transversity , we will use two different models , the su(6 ) quark - diquark model and the pqcd based counting rule analysis .",
    "the asymmetry measured by the experiment is defined as : @xmath3 where @xmath4 refers to unpolarized beam and transversely polarized target .",
    "the asymmetry is evaluated as a function of the angles @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 denotes the azimuthal angle of the detected two hadron plane with respect to the lepton plane , and @xmath6 denotes the azimuthal angle of the polarization vector @xmath9 with respect to the lepton plane .",
    "@xmath7 is the polar angle of the first hadron in the hadron pair s center - of - mass frame with respect to the direction of the summed hadron momentum in the lab frame .",

    "a quark with initial momentum @xmath17 changes to a state with momentum @xmath18 after the photon hit it .",
    "we define the light - cone variable @xmath19 , which represents the fraction of target momentum carried by the quark .",
    "the detected two hadrons have momenta @xmath20 and @xmath21 , masses @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and total invariant mass @xmath24 .",
    "we introduce the vectors @xmath25 and @xmath26 , i.e. , the total and relative momenta of the hadron pair , respectively .",
    "we have @xmath27 if only @xmath2 pairs are considered now .",
    "similar to @xmath28 , we define @xmath29 , which represents the fraction of fragmenting quark momentum carried by the produced hadrons .",
    "we will also introduce a light - cone fraction @xmath30 , which describes how the total momentum of the pair is split into the two hadrons , @xmath31    with the definitions above , the cross section up to leading twist can be expressed as :  @xcite @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 . here ,",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath36 denote the unpolarized and the transversity distribution functions respectively . @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the new introduced interference ffs , describing a quark fragmenting to a pair of hadrons , for example , @xmath2 pairs . after integration of @xmath8 , @xmath6 and @xmath39 , we define the weighted asymmetry : @xmath40 more details on the interference ffs will be given in the next section .",
    "in this paper we will adopt two models : the su(6 ) quark - diquark model  @xcite and the pqcd based counting rule analysis  @xcite to get the transversity distributions .",

    "but two models behave differently when @xmath41 : the su(6 ) quark - spectator - diquark model  @xcite predicts @xmath42 , while the pqcd based counting rule analysis  @xcite predicts @xmath43 . in a recent literature  @xcite , anselmino _",
    "_ extracted the transversity distribution for @xmath44 and @xmath45 quarks from the now available data , and showed some evidence that @xmath46 and @xmath47 to be opposite in sign , with @xmath48 smaller than @xmath49 .",

    "the factor @xmath66 appearing due to the jacobian can be absorbed in the definition of integrated interference ffs .",
    "the explicit expressions for @xmath67 and @xmath68 can be found in ref .",
    "we present the final formula for calculating the asymmetry : @xmath69 by integrating through various ways on the numerator and denominator , we can get the asymmetry depending on different kinematical variables . in this paper , the dependencies on @xmath70 , @xmath28 and @xmath71 are calculated .    for each target , we will perform the numerical calculations under both hermes and compass experiment cuts . in the hermes experiment ,",
    "the kinematical cuts are : @xmath72 for the @xmath73 and @xmath74 used in the integration over @xmath75 and @xmath28 , we use the relations @xmath76 with @xmath77 in the hermes experiments .    for compass ,",
    "the kinematics are : @xmath78 we notice first that the beam energy is extremely high ( @xmath79 beam with 160gev ) that the compass experiment can detect very small @xmath28 region , so for convenience , we will adopt the logarithm coordinate .",
    "second , compass can reach a higher @xmath70 than hermes , but the model for the interference ffs does not consider the contributions from resonances with higher masses .",
    "we argue that the parametrization should be modified for higher invariant mass of the pair system , so here we only present the calculation up to the hermes cut for @xmath70 .",
    "the numerical result for proton target are shown in fig .",
    "[ phermes ] and fig .",
    "[ pcompass ] .    , but at compass kinematics ]    , but at compass kinematics ]    from fig .",
    "[ phermes ] and fig .",
    "[ pcompass ] , we can see that different models for the transversity give almost the same predictions on the asymmetry for the proton target .",
    "this is because the proton target is dominated by @xmath44 quarks , and the two models give similar predictions on @xmath44 quark distributions  @xcite . besides this",
    ", the contribution from @xmath44 quarks should be magnified by 4 times due to the charge .",
    "so we conclude that the result is insensitive to the models of transversity for proton target , thus from this experiment , we can not distinguish the two models .",
    "however , in the mediate @xmath28 region , this gives us a chance to measure the unknown interference ffs , which is helpful to explore the new domain .",
    "now , different models give different predictions on the interference ffs . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the ff was anticipated to change sign around @xmath80 mass , while in ref .",
    "@xcite , they predicted a peak at @xmath80 mass . even between the results in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite , there are also slightly differences . if the conclusion that the asymmetry is insensitive to different approaches of the transversity holds , we expect the experiments to publish more data on proton target to clarify the details on the interference ffs .",
    "the result for deuteron target is shown in fig .",
    "[ dhermes ] and fig .",
    "[ dcompass ] .    , but for deuteron target . ]    , but for deuteron target . ]    inside the deuteron , the @xmath44 and @xmath45 quarks have the same distribution , and because of the charge , @xmath44 quarks still dominant here , and the asymmetry is still not so sensitive to different models of the transversity .",
    "so the deuteron target can also be used to measure the interference ffs . combining the experiment data from the proton and deuteron targets",
    ", we can get abundant information not only on the interference ffs but also the transversity distributions , especially for @xmath44 quarks .",
    "although from the data on deuteron target , we can get a first glance at the transversity distribution for @xmath45 quarks , we suggest a directly measurement using the neutron target .",
    "[ nhermes ] and fig .",
    "[ ncompass ] show the result on the neutron target .    , but the neutron target is assumed here . ]    , but the neutron target is assumed here . ]    due to the fact that the information on @xmath71-dependence and @xmath70-dependence is only contained in the interference ffs , two models should give nearly the same prediction on the @xmath71 and @xmath70 dependence of the asymmetry , which is similar to the proton and deuteron targets .",
    "but for @xmath28-dependence , because @xmath45 quarks dominate in the neutron target , and two models give quite different predictions on the @xmath45 quark distributions  @xcite , the two models might exhibit their differences here , even if the contribution from @xmath45 quarks is suppressed by a factor of 4 originated from the square of the electric charge compared with @xmath44 quarks .",
    "as the figures show , different models for the transversity predict differently on the asymmetry when @xmath28 increases , thus this is helpful for us to distinguish the two models .",
    "however , we should notice that this effect is apparent only in the large @xmath28 region .",
    "both hermes and compass did the experiment in the relative low @xmath28 region , and this difference is not so obvious there .",
    "so we expect further experiments will reach higher @xmath28 region to help us distinguish the models .",
    "another problem is that it is difficult to acquire free neutron target , so @xmath0he target is suggested , which can be considered as an effectively free neutron , because two protons inside the nucleus form a spin singlet .",
    "jlab has planned measurements on the @xmath0he target , so we look forward to the result from jlab .",
    "careful analysis with data from both proton and deuteron targets may also provide an extraction of neutron result .",
    "this can be done by combining both hermes and compass experiments , or compass perform precision measurements on both proton and deuteron targets respectively .    unlike the case in single pion production where the the predictions on the neutron are insensitive to different models  @xcite , the double pion production are ideal to distinguish between different model predictions .",
    "the first reason is that there is no dilation caused by unfavored fragmentation functions as in the single pion case , so that the contribution from the @xmath45-distribution of the nucleon ( in fact it is @xmath44-distribution in the neutron ) can manifest itself more clearly in double pion interference fragmentation .",
    "another important reason is that the two pion interference fragmentation function causes the @xmath45-quark contribution to have an opposite sign compared to that of the @xmath44-quark contribution in the single spin asymmetry formula  @xcite , so that the calculated single spin asymmetries are always negative in both the two models for the neutron case .",
    "more explicitly , we can predict the large @xmath28-behavior @xmath81 at @xmath82 for the single spin asymmetry .",
    "this provides a strong motivation to do experiments on extracting the neutron result of single spin asymmetry in double hadron production .",
    "transversity distribution is the less known piece in understanding the spin structure of the nucleon due to its chiral - odd nature .",
    "single spin asymmetry of single hadron production in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) provide a way accessing the transversity , in which the transversity distribution couples with an also chiral - odd fragmentation function ( ff ) , the collins function .",
    "another interesting way to measure the transversity is through observing single spin asymmetry ( ssa ) in double hadron production , where transversity gets factorized with the so called interference ff .",
    "one advantage for this method is that the interference ff can be measured separately in the @xmath1 annihilation process , so that we can get a clean result on transversity .",
    "hermes has already finished the experiment and will publish their data in near future .",
    "compass has also published their preliminary data and is still accumulating data . in this paper , we present numerical calculation for the proton , deuteron and neutron target respectively at the hermes and compass kinematic region , using two models for transversity and a set of parametrization of interference ffs provided by ref .",
    "we found that two models , the su(6 ) quark - diquark model and the pqcd based counting rule analysis give quite similar prediction at hermes and compass kinematics for the proton and deuteron target , i.e. , the result is insensitive to different approaches of the transversity .",
    "thus we argue that the hermes and compass experiment can provide rich information on the interference ffs . for the neutron target",
    ", we found that the two models give different predictions at large @xmath28 region , which is helpful to distinguish them .",
    "so we suggest doing experiments with @xmath0he target ( an effective neutron target ) at large @xmath28 region to give more information , especially that on the transversity of @xmath45 quarks .",
    "maybe jlab will bring us exciting results .",
    "careful analysis of data from both proton and deuteron targets by hermes and compass might be also useful to extract the neutron result , for the sake to confront different theoretical predictions on transversity .",
