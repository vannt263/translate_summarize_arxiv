    "semileptonic kaon decays have the potential to provide information on the @xmath2 ckm matrix element . in principle @xmath3",
    "decays offer the most simple setting , but the fact that these are driven by the axial - vector qcd current , hence the kaon decay constant , diminish their capability  : @xmath4 is not given by symmetry and has to be input from theory , e.g. lattice .",
    "something analogous happens in @xmath0 processes where another parameter guided by strong interactions , i.e. the vector form factor at zero transfer of momentum , has to be determined .",
    "however several fortunate features happen together in the later decays that convert them in an excellent system to extract information on @xmath1  : i ) only the qcd vector current contributes to @xmath0 decays .",
    "due to the conservation of this current in the @xmath5 limit ( cvc ) , the normalization at zero transfer of momentum is known in this limit ; ii ) corrections to the above result only start at second order in the symmetry breaking parameter , i.e. @xmath6 $ ] for three flavours @xcite .",
    "the form factors of the vector current in @xmath0 decays are defined by  : @xmath7 & + &     f_{0}^{k^0 \\pi^-}(t ) \\frac{\\delta_{k \\pi}}{t } q_{\\mu } \\nonumber , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 are known as the vector and scalar form factors , respectively .",

    "as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) , the determination of @xmath1 from @xmath0 decays relies essentially in our ability to ascertain an accurate value for @xmath19 .",
    "we have some basic model - independent knowledge on @xmath19 . in the @xmath20 limit",
    ", cvc establishes that @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , a known sum rule @xcite asserts that @xmath22 and , consequently , flavour breaking corrections given by the ademollo - gatto theorem @xcite should be negative . given this setting our goal in order to provide a close determination of @xmath19",
    "is to evaluate @xmath20 breaking corrections to @xmath0 decays . the appropriate framework to perform",
    "this task is chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath23pt ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath20 breaking contributions span the deviation of @xmath19  from unity  : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is of @xmath27 in the chiral expansion .",
    "the @xmath28 correction amounts to a pure one - loop calculation ( there is no local contribution from counterterms ) and then it is essentially free from uncertainties , giving @xmath29 @xcite . at @xmath24",
    "the situation is more complex .",
    "the first estimate was obtained by relating @xmath19  to the matrix element of the vector charge between a kaon and a pion in the infinite - momentum limit @xcite .",
    "this procedure understates chiral log contributions and gives  : @xmath30 that essentially coincides with the result provided by the light - front quark model @xcite .    within @xmath23pt all kind of possible contributions",
    "appear @xcite  : @xmath31 loop terms can be evaluated with small uncertainty @xcite obtaining  : @xmath32 while the tree ",
    "level part is , a priori , unknown and can be expressed in terms of chiral low - energy couplings ( lecs ) of the chiral lagrangian both at @xmath28 @xcite and @xmath24 @xcite  : @xmath33 \\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the pion decay constant . while the @xmath35 couplings are rather well known both from direct phenomenology @xcite and on more theoretical grounds @xcite , our knowledge on the @xmath24 @xmath36 lecs is still rather poor . as a consequence",
    "it is difficult to provide a determination for the @xmath24 contribution to @xmath19 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors did combine their loop evaluation together with the leutwyler & roos ( lr ) result @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lr ] ) , assuming that the later stands for the @xmath36 contribution . as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite it is more natural to presume that @xmath37 indicates the full tree contribution @xmath38 . this would give  : @xmath39 several strategies to determine @xmath40 have been developed  : on one side lattice quenched and unquenched evaluations are now at hand @xcite , on the other there are theoretical tools that may provide a determination of the unknown lecs .",
    "the latter are usually encoded as analytical evaluations and will be considered in the following .",
    "the @xmath24 determination of the @xmath0 form factors shows that the scalar form factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fff ] ) depends on the same @xmath24 lecs than @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "it can be written as  : @xmath42 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 , @xmath44 receives contributions from @xmath28 and @xmath24 and its only dependence in lecs involves @xmath35 at @xmath24 .",
    "moreover @xmath45 .",
    "hence it is possible to extract the @xmath36 lecs from data if a good knowledge on the slope and curvature of the scalar form factor is available  : @xmath46 this procedure has been addressed in ref .",
    "the @xmath41 scalar form factor was reconstructed from a coupled - channel dispersion relation analysis from @xmath41 scattering data @xcite and then employed to obtain information on the lecs using eq .",
    "( [ eq : slocur ] ) above . by adding @xmath47 to the chiral logs they obtain  :",
    "@xmath48 where most of the error arises from the determination of the @xmath36 lecs .",
    "this tiny value comes from an almost complete cancellation between the loop and tree contributions .",
    "the determination of the @xmath41 scalar form factor from @xmath41 scattering data shows that , in order to solve the coupled channel dispersion relations , two integration constants are required .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have input @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "accordingly their evaluation can be viewed more as a consistency check of the fact that @xmath51 than a pure determination of the @xmath36 lecs .",
    "a systematic procedure to account for the resonance contributions to chiral lecs involves the construction of a lagrangian theory in terms of @xmath20 ( pseudo - goldstone mesons ) and @xmath52 ( heavier resonances ) flavour multiplets as active degrees of freedom . this is called resonance chiral theory ( r@xmath23 t ) .",
    "the method was applied in ref .",
    "@xcite to evaluate the resonance contributions to @xmath28 chiral lecs and has recently been extended @xcite to look upon the @xmath24 lecs .",
    "the scheme relies in two key premises  : i ) the most general possible lagrangian , including all terms consistent with assumed symmetry principles provides the most general possible s - matrix amplitude consistent with analyticity , perturbative unitarity , cluster decomposition and the specified principles of symmetry @xcite ; ii ) it has been suggested that large-@xmath53 qcd , embodied in an effective local lagrangian for the study of meson dynamics , shows features that resemble , both qualitatively and quantitatively , the @xmath54 case @xcite .",
    "the procedure that has been devised amounts to construct the lagrangian theory by imposing the chiral symmetry constraints on the pseudo - goldstone mesons and unitary symmetry on the resonance fields .",
    "this guarantees the proper chiral limit .",
    "in addition short - distance dynamics is enforced on the couplings of the theory by demanding either the appropriate asymptotic behaviour for green functions that are order parameters of the chiral symmetry breaking or the high - energy smoothing of form factors of qcd currents @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the phenomenological value of @xmath28 lecs is saturated by the lightest spectrum not included in @xmath23pt , i.e. resonances .",
    "this result seems to persist at one - loop in r@xmath23 t @xcite .",
    "an analogous result for the @xmath24 lecs has still not been reached though there is no hint that indicates it could happen otherwise  : resonance saturation seems to be an underlying property stemming from non - perturbative qcd .",
    "the analysis , along the lines outlined above , of the @xmath55 green function give us the following contributions of scalar and pseudoscalar resonances to the relevant lecs in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fp6tree ] ) @xcite  : @xmath56 where @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) is the mass of the lightest multiplet of scalar ( pseudoscalar ) resonances . substituting these values into @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fp6tree ] ) we get  : @xmath59 as can be seen in figure  [ fig : ftree ] there is an almost complete cancellation between the two different counterterm contributions .",
    "this is a fortunate feature because the resulting dependence in the scalar resonance mass happens to be tiny . for @xmath60 and",
    "adding the chiral logs we get  : @xmath61 notice that the sign of the central value is opposite to previous predictions above .",
    "however this is not significant because , as in @xmath62 or @xmath63 , the result is compatible with zero .",
    "( 300,175 ) ( 105,65)(50,50 ) ( 190,0 ) @xmath64 ( 2,165 ) @xmath65 ( 130,130 ) @xmath66 ( 130,60 ) @xmath67",
    "lattice results , both quenched @xcite or unquenched @xcite are available . in table  [ tab : uno ] we compare these with the results from analytical determinations reviewed above .",
    "two trends are easily revealed  : i ) lattice results , both quenched and unquenched , are in excellent agreement with the result by lr ; ii ) analytical determinations driven by chiral logs and evaluations of the @xmath24 chiral lecs show a clear tension with the lattice ones , namely when lecs are determined by resonance saturation .",
    ".[tab : uno ] comparison of different predictions for @xmath68 . [ cols= \" <",
    ", < \" , ]     the lr prediction plays down @xmath24 chiral logs hence it may be an accurate prescription as long as these are not important .",
    "however the chiral determination ( [ eq : op6loop ] ) shows that part of them are indeed large and positive , hence the addition of chiral logs and lr produces a cancellation that manifests in the @xmath69 result of table  [ tab : uno ] .",
    "if the lr prediction stands for the local @xmath24 contribution it can be compared with @xmath47 showing a clear discrepancy  : all lec determinations conclude that the final result for @xmath47 is tiny ( consistent with zero ) while @xmath37 is comparatively large .    there is also a point to be understood with the lattice analyses .",
    "the latter unquenched result @xcite agrees fully with the quenched determination from ref .",
    "this could be expected if chiral logs were definitely small but eq .",
    "( [ eq : op6loop ] ) shows that this is not the case .",
    "the unquenched determination could miss the curvature provided by the chiral logs in the necessary extrapolation performed to reach the physical values of the masses and then its tiny error should be indeed larger .",
    "finally there is another recourse .",
    "lattice evaluations determine @xmath70 , i.e. they cover all chiral @xmath20 symmetry breaking corrections except the first one .",
    "though it would be most rare , if chiral corrections higher than @xmath24",
    "were large these could bring an explanation to the discrepancy between the chiral and lattice results .",
    "however at present there is no expectation for an estimate of chiral @xmath71 contributions .",
    "determinations of @xmath1 from @xmath0 using the values of @xmath19  in table  [ tab : uno ] could also have a say to discern in the discussion just sketched .",
    "taking into account the later published value @xmath72 @xcite , the _ lr _ value gives @xmath73 , _",
    "@xmath69 _ lowers it to @xmath74 while _ resonance saturation _ brings it down to @xmath75 .",
    "all of them are away from the value obtained by the unitarity constraint @xmath76 @xcite though , within errors , the latter is compatible with the _ lr _ evaluation .",
    "the study of @xmath19  is an all - important key to obtain an accurate value of @xmath1 from @xmath0 decays .",
    "driven by @xmath20 breaking contributions its determination is , however , tampered by the non - perturbative nature of these corrections . as we have seen , and though the errors are still large , there is essentially no agreement between lattice evaluations and lr on one side , and chiral evaluations on the other .",
    "several points need to be asserted on the @xmath24 contributions  : i ) the size of the chiral logs has to be confirmed .",
    "if they stand as at present then unquenched lattice results should revise their extrapolation and error estimate .",
    "in addition the lr prediction should also be amended ; ii ) local contributions have also to be analysed .",
    "though all lec determinations agree that their contribution is tiny , this conclusion is at odds with the lr evaluation .    in conclusion",
    "more work is needed in order to disentangle the @xmath24 contributions to @xmath19 .",
    "a check of the size of the chiral logs would be very much welcome and , moreover , whether there is a failure of the resonance saturation hypothesis , employed in the determination of @xmath24 chiral lecs , or of the other models appointed to evaluate these local contributions , the situation deserves closer attention .",
