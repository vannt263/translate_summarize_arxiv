    "the study of the four nucleon ( @xmath6 ) system is interesting from a number of different perspectives .",
    "first of all , many reactions involving four nucleons , like @xmath7(@xmath8,@xmath9)@xmath10 , @xmath7(@xmath8,@xmath11)@xmath12 , or @xmath13 ( the @xmath14 process ) , are of extreme astrophysical interest , as they play important roles in solar models or in big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "the @xmath14 process , for instance , is the source of the highest energy neutrinos from the sun .",
    "moreover , @xmath6 systems have become increasingly important as testing grounds for models of the nuclear force .",
    "while not the nuclear - structure `` imbroglio '' of heavy nuclei , the @xmath15 system is the simplest system that presents the complexity  thresholds and resonances  that characterize nuclear systems , and therefore is a very good testing ground of modern few - body techniques  @xcite .",
    "similarly , since the @xmath6 bound state is ( to a very good approximation ) a @xmath16 state , it is a good `` laboratory '' for the study of the strange quark components of the nucleon via parity - violating electron - scattering experiments  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical description of @xmath17 systems still constitutes a challenging problem from the standpoint of nuclear few - body theory . only recently , with the near - constant increase in computing power and the development of new numerical methods , has the study of the @xmath18-particle bound state reached a satisfactory level of accuracy ; the @xmath6 bound - state has been calculated to a few tenths of kev @xcite .",
    "the study of @xmath6 scattering states , on the other hand , is less satisfactorily developed .",
    "the same increases in computational power , however , have opened the possibility for accurate calculations of the @xmath6 observables using realistic models for nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath4 ) and three - nucleon ( @xmath5 ) forces .",
    "these calculations have been performed mainly by means of the faddeev - yakubovsky ( fy ) approach  @xcite and the kohn variational principle  @xcite . in spite of this progress",
    ", some disagreements still exist between theoretical groups , as for example , in the calculation of the _ n_-@xmath10total cross section in the peak region ( around @xmath19 mev )  @xcite .    to make matters worse , even in cases where the theoretical calculations agree , they are often strongly at variance with the experimental data . for example , the proton analyzing power @xmath1 in",
    "p_-@xmath12elastic scattering is underestimated by theory at the peak of the angular distribution by about 40% @xcite .",
    "other disagreements are discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the existing data in the literature for 4@xmath20 scattering are of lesser quality , when compared with the excellent and abundant data that exists for the @xmath4and @xmath5 ( scattering ) systems .",
    "the intensely studied @xmath21 system is ( unfortunately ) very difficult to describe theoretically due to the presence of the bound state and many higher - energy resonances  @xcite .",
    "this leads us to investigate _ p_-@xmath12scattering states .",
    "this paper will focus on _",
    "p_-@xmath12elastic scattering at low energies , which is simpler than the @xmath21 system to investigate theoretically .",
    "however , the situation for the closely related _",
    "n_-@xmath10elastic scattering case is worth briefly discussing first .",
    "the quantities of interest in _ n_-@xmath10zero - energy scattering are the zero - energy total cross section @xmath22 and the coherent scattering length @xmath23 .",
    "experimentally , only the total cross section @xmath24 has been measured with high precision for a large range of energies .",
    "the extrapolation of the measured @xmath24 to zero energy is straightforward and the value obtained is @xmath25 b  @xcite .",
    "the coherent scattering length has been measured by neutron - interferometry techniques .",
    "the most recent value reported in the literature is @xmath26 fm  @xcite .",
    "an additional estimation of @xmath27 fm has been obtained from _",
    "p_-@xmath12data by using an approximate coulomb - corrected r - matrix theory  @xcite .",
    "these values should be compared with those obtained theoretically : @xmath28 b and @xmath29 fm  @xcite",
    ".    as already mentioned , at higher energies ( specifically in the `` peak '' region ) there exist sizable discrepancies between different theoretical predictions .",
    "the @xmath24 calculations by fonseca @xcite and pfitzinger , hofmann , and hale  @xcite are in good agreement with the experimental data , while the calculations by the grenoble  @xcite and pisa groups  @xcite are well below the data .",
    "the origin of this disagreement is still not clear .",
    "let us consider now the situation for _",
    "p_-@xmath12elastic scattering .",
    "the zero - energy quantities for this case are more difficult to evaluate .",
    "approximate values of the triplet and singlet scattering lengths have been determined from effective range extrapolations @xcite to zero energy of data taken mostly above 1 mev , and therefore suffer large uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "this problem has been reconsidered recently by george and knutson  @xcite ; this new phase - shift analysis ( psa ) gave two possible sets of scattering - length values , both of which are at variance with the theoretical estimates ( see the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite . )    the world database of existing _",
    "p_-@xmath12scattering data can be divided in three energy regions .",
    "there is a set of cross section and proton analyzing power @xmath1measurements at very low energies , from @xmath30 to @xmath31 mev  @xcite .",
    "another energy region is for @xmath32 to @xmath33 mev which includes the recent @xmath1measurements at @xmath34 and @xmath35 mev @xcite .",
    "however , these @xmath1data are not very precise .",
    "the cross - section data in this region are similarly imprecise and sparse in number .",
    "they are also very old , being the very first published cross - section data for _ p_-@xmath12elastic scattering found in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the third group of measurements ( for @xmath36 mev ) includes differential cross sections , proton and @xmath12 analyzing power measurements , and spin correlation coefficients of good precision .",
    "references for all these measurements can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the calculations performed so far for _ p_-@xmath12scattering have shown a glaring discrepancy between theory and experiment in the proton analyzing power  @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy is very similar to the well known `` @xmath1puzzle '' in scattering .",
    "this is a fairly old problem , already reported almost 30 years ago  @xcite in the case of and later confirmed also in the case  @xcite .",
    "all theoretical calculations based on realistic @xmath4potentials ( even including @xmath5 forces ) underestimate the measured nucleon vector analyzing power @xmath1by about @xmath37 % .",
    "the same problem also occurs for the vector analyzing power of the deuteron @xmath38  @xcite , while the tensor analyzing powers @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are reasonably well described  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of standard models of the @xmath5 force have little effect on calculations of these observables . to solve this puzzle , speculations about the deficiency of the @xmath4potentials in @xmath42 waves ( where the spectroscopic notation @xmath43 has been adopted )",
    "have been suggested .",
    "looking at @xmath4scattering data only , this possibility does not seem to be ruled out  @xcite .",
    "however , after taking theoretical constraints into account  @xcite , this solution was considered unlikely , and has been confirmed by recent calculations which show that this puzzle is not solved even when new @xmath4potentials derived from effective field theory are used  @xcite .    consequently , attention has focused on exotic @xmath5 force terms not contemplated so far .",
    "the best solution seems to be given by the inclusion of a spin - orbit @xmath5 force  @xcite ; such a force has a negligible effect on the observables already well reproduced by standard @xmath5 potential models ( such as the binding energies , unpolarized cross sections and tensor analyzing powers ) but it is very effective for solving  or at least for noticeably reducing  the discrepancy .",
    "other explanations have been proposed in refs .  .",
    "it should be noted that the current understanding of the 3n interaction is rather poor  @xcite , and new terms in the @xmath5 interactions derived from chiral perturbation theory have very recently been proposed  @xcite .",
    "these new models have to be tested primarily in the @xmath5 system , but the @xmath6 system could also play an important role .",
    "in fact , @xmath5 force effects are expected to be sizeable in the @xmath6 system @xcite ; in the scattering system @xmath5 force effects are small  @xcite and masked in part by the contribution of the coulomb potential  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the system is essentially a pure isospin @xmath44 state .",
    "tests of the @xmath45 channel in any @xmath5 force can only be satisfactorily performed in a @xmath6 system such as _ p_-@xmath12 .    seeking to explore potential three - nucleon force effects in a different system , and to investigate this new @xmath17 @xmath1puzzle , a series of proton- @xmath12 elastic scattering measurements",
    "have been made .",
    "angular distributions of the differential cross section @xmath0and proton analyzing power @xmath1have been measured at several energies below 5 mev ; the analyzing power experiments were performed with a gas - cell target and the @xmath0measurements were performed using a supersonic gas - jet target .",
    "the nominal proton energy @xmath3at which each experiment was performed is listed in table [ table : exp : energies ] .",
    "these energies were chosen to maximize the improvement in the low energy database , and because theoretical calculations are tractable in this region .",
    "in addition , we present new theoretical calculations for the _ p_-@xmath12system .",
    "they are performed via an expansion of the wave functions of the scattering states in terms of a hyperspherical harmonic ( hh ) basis and using the complex form of the kohn variational principle  @xcite .",
    "these new calculations reach a much higher degree of accuracy than those performed previously using the correlated hyperspherical harmonic ( chh ) functions  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present calculations based on the argonne @xmath46 ( av18 )  @xcite @xmath4potential , which represents the @xmath4interaction in its full richness , with short - range repulsion , tensor and other non - central components and charge symmetry breaking terms .",
    "the calculations are performed without and with the inclusion of the urbana ix ( uix ) @xmath5 force  @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : theory ] , a brief description of the hh technique is reported ; in section [ sec : exp ] , the experimental setup and methods are discussed ; the cross section @xmath0and proton analyzing power @xmath1measurements are compared with the theoretical results in section [ sec : compare ] ; finally , section [ sec : conclusions ] is devoted to the conclusions and broader context of the present work .",

    "are included first ( i.e. those with @xmath150 ) , then those correlating three particles are added and so on .",
    "the calculation begins by including in the expansion of the wave function the hh states of the first class c1 having grand angular quantum number @xmath151 and studying the convergence of a quantity of interest ( for example , the phase - shifts ) by increasing the value of @xmath152 .",
    "once a satisfactory value of @xmath153 is reached , the states of the second class with @xmath154 are added in the expansion , keeping all the states of the class c1 with @xmath153 . then @xmath155 is increased until the desired convergence is achieved and so on .",

    "( [ eq : psia ] ) , namely @xmath159 , @xmath160 . consequently , for this wave the s - matrix reduces to a value which is parametrized ( as usual ) as @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is known as the `` elasticity parameter '' .",
    "note that in the application of the kohn principle given in  ( [ eq : kohn ] ) the value @xmath163 is not guaranteed : it is achieved only when the corresponding internal part @xmath164 is well described by the hh basis .",
    "we have used the value of @xmath162 as a check of the convergence of the hh expansion . in cases of poor convergence ,",
    "the value of @xmath162 has been found to depend very much also on the choice of @xmath165 , the function used to regularize the coulomb function @xmath71 .",
    "this function has been chosen to depend on a non - linear parameter @xmath166 , and thus a test of the convergence is performed by analyzing the dependence of @xmath162 on the parameter @xmath166 . at the beginning of the calculation , when the number of hh functions is not large enough to get convergence , @xmath162 is extremely dependent on the value of @xmath166 .",
    "the phase shift @xmath167 , however , depends less critically on @xmath166 . by increasing the number of hh components in the internal wave function we observe that @xmath168 , and that the dependence on @xmath166 becomes negligible .",
    "notice that the convergence rate has been found to depend on the value of @xmath166 ; some critical values of this parameter exist where the convergence can be very slow .",
    "however , it is not difficult to find ranges of values of @xmath166 where the convergence is fast and smooth and the final results are independent of @xmath166 . since we are interested in the convergence of the hh function , we have chosen @xmath166 in one of the `` favorable '' regions , where the convergence is achieved in a smooth and fast way .",
    "a detailed study on this subject will be reported elsewhere .",
    "let us now briefly discuss the choice of the classes of hh states for the @xmath169 case .",
    "note that , since the wave under consideration is of negative parity , only hh functions with odd values of @xmath112 and @xmath170 have to be considered .",
    "moreover , we consider in this work only states with total isospin @xmath171 , as the effect of the states with @xmath172 should be negligible .",
    "the criteria used to select the appropriate classes of hh functions require that the states with lowest @xmath173 be considered first .",
    "a few of the channels considered in the calculation have been reported in table  [ table : theory : chan0m1 ] .",
    "the final choice of classes for the case @xmath169 is detailed below .       as can be seen in table [ table : extra ] ,",
    "@xmath175 is estimated to be rather small at @xmath176 and @xmath35 mev . however",

    "analogous problems have been found for the @xmath178 and @xmath179 states , whereas for the other states the convergence did not present any difficulty .    since at the moment",
    "the inclusion of a greater number of states would require a significant increase in computing time , we have preferred to use the extrapolation outlined above for obtaining estimates for the converged phase - shifts and mixing parameters for the @xmath169 , @xmath178 and @xmath179 states . to show the effect of the extrapolation on the observables , we present in fig .",

    "the other phase - shift were taken with their final values ( in particular , for the @xmath178 and @xmath179 phase - shifts , we used the extrapolated values obtained using a similar procedure as described above ) .",
    "the four observables considered in the figure are : the differential cross section @xmath0 , the proton analyzing power @xmath1 , the @xmath12 analyzing power @xmath185 , and the spin correlation coefficient @xmath186 .",
    "as can be seen , there is a good convergence for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath186 .",
    "the observable @xmath185is more sensitive to @xmath167 , and the convergence is more critical . in any case , however , the thick solid curves are rather close to the thin solid curves , showing that the convergence has been nearly reached .",
