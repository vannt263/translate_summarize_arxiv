    "they have not taken into account the radial drift of dust , but the dust condensation may occur in their scenario in the same manner as in @xcite .",
    "therefore , this also possibly supports the present scenario .",
    "the numerical simulation of secular gi that include these effects may enable the analysis on the interplay between these mechanisms , which will be our future work .",
    "since secular gi concentrates the dust , planetesimals could be formed in rings .",

    "the growth timescales of secular gi in the outer regions ( @xmath125au ) are comparable to the estimated age of the central star and the disk .",
    "therefore natural interpretation is that the outer region is in the early growth phase of secular gi .",
    "in contrast to the outer region , however , the inner region may have gone to the non - linear stages of secular gi because the growth timescales of secular gi in the inner regions are smaller than those in the outer regions .",
    "therefore , we speculate that the non - linear growth of secular gi may have resulted in the formation of planets that make gaps observed at @xmath1 au and @xmath2 au ( fig .",

    "we can simply expect the missing dust mass in the gap corresponds to the mass of heavy elements in the hypothetical planet in the gap .",
    "since we adopt the dust - to - gas mass ratio @xmath128 for our disk model that causes the secular gi , we should expect that the actual total mass of the planet in the gap can be about 50 times larger than the heavy element mass of the planet , if all the gaseous components of the disk in the gap accrete onto the planet .",
    "this argument means that we set the expected ranges of masses of the planets in the inner two gaps are @xmath129 and @xmath130 , for d1 and d2 , respectively .",
    "when dust grains grow sufficiently in a high density region , the opacity of the ring decreases and the dust thermal radiation may remain weak in the ring .",
    "even after the formation of planetesimals or protoplanets , the ring may remain as an invisible planetesimal belt . in this scenario , we expect to have a chance to observe the outcome of planet formation only after the mass of a planet increases sufficiently .    on the other hand , various authors estimated the masses of the hypothetical planets in the gaps by assuming the structure in the disk is created by hypothetical planets in the gap .",
    "for example , @xcite provided an approximate relation of the gap depth / width and the planet mass . according to their relation",
    "we can obtain the hypothetical planet mass in the gap : @xmath131 for d1 and @xmath132 for d2 .",
    "this may mean that gaseous components in the disk do not perfectly accrete onto the planet in the gap . despite the simplification in our argument , the - order - of - magnitude agreement between the maximum planet mass expected from the formation mechanism and",
    "the mass estimated from the resultant gap structure is reasonable and may motivate further investigation in this line of research .",
    "one of the differences between the present paper and other papers on hl tau is in the connection of planet formation mechanism to the ring structure in the disk .",
    "papers on gap opening dynamics simply assumed the existence of planets and did not discussed their origins ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , other papers on the mechanism to create multiple rings without embedded planets did not directly link the ring formation to mechanisms of planet formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) partly because the ring formation in the disk is regarded as a transient phenomenon @xcite .",
    "to theoretically verify the discussion in this section , we need to investigate the nonlinear growth of secular gi in the realistic situation taking into account the dust growth and radial drift .",
    "in this work , we perform linear stability analyses of secular gi adopting the physical values obtained from observation of hl tau as background state . we calculated the radial distributions of the most unstable wavelength and the growth timescale of secular gi and verify that secular gi can form the ring structures observed in hl tau .",
    "we use two background states : exponentially cutoff disk model and power - law disk model .",
    "both models give similar results .",
    "we showed that secular gi grows in the outer region @xmath133 au when we adopt the dust surface density , temperature , and a turbulent viscosity coefficient obtained from the observation . around a radius of 100au ,",
    "the most unstable wavelength is about 10 au , and growth timescale is about @xmath87 yr and @xmath113 yr for exponentially cutoff and power - law disk model respectively .",
    "the wavelength is consistent with the observed separations of the rings .",
    "when we adopt a turbulent viscosity coefficient @xmath134)^2 $ ] , secular gi grows in the region @xmath135 au .",
    "thus , secular gi forms all rings whose width is about 10 au .",
    "moreover , in the case that we adopt a turbulent viscosity coefficient @xmath134)^3 $ ] , secular gi grows in the whole disk . since the growth timescale in the inner region",
    "@xmath136 au is about an order of magnitude smaller than that of in the outer region @xmath137 au , secular gi can rapidly grow in the inner region .",
    "if the rings formed in the outer region move inward with the disk accretion , secular gi can naturally form the equi - separation rings if the separations remain the same in the accretion process .",
    "since secular gi concentrate the dust , it supports the dust growth .",
    "because the growth timescale of secular gi in the inner region may be smaller than the estimated age of hl tau , plant could be formed in rings in the inner region . in this case , resulting objects are expected to create the gaps at @xmath1 au and @xmath138 30 au . if the scenario described in this article is indeed realized in hl tau , it means that we are witnessing both the early stage of planet formation and the stage after the planet formation : early growth of the most unstable mode of secular gi and the gap structure carved by resulting planets .",
    "therefore , further observation of hl tau would give more detailed information for various stages of planet formation .",

    "<S> when a turbulent viscosity coefficient @xmath0 remains small in inner region of the disk , secular gi grows in the whole disk . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the formation of planetary mass objects should occur first in the inner region as a result of gravitational fragmentation after the non - linear growth of secular gi . in this case , resulting objects are expected to create the gaps at @xmath1 au and @xmath2 au . as a result , </S>",
