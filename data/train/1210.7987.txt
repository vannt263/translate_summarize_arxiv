    "<S> our analysis is at least relevant in defining the correct expression for the effective mass value of neutrinos used in the confront with the cosmological data . from the phenomenological point of view , some of the most recent neutrino mass claims provide us with some effective mass values given in terms of @xmath88 @xcite and @xmath89 @xcite . the mass fractional error , @xmath77 , that we have addressed through the results from fig .  [ an7 ] </S>",
    "<S> are correspondingly given by , @xmath90 for both hierarchies . </S>",
    "<S> notice that at mass scales @xmath91 , normal and inverted hierarchies lead to corrections of the same magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> as one can notice , for the non - relativistic regime the corrections does not reach 1% of the phenomenological values . </S>",
    "<S> the corrections increase exponentially for smaller values of the mass scale .    </S>",
    "<S> the consistency of our approach with previous quantum mechanics predictions and its theoretical support provided by the fundamentals of the generalized theory of quantum measurements have shown that the correct interpretation of flavor associated energies demands for a statistical description through density matrices . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to emphasize that without determining the measurement procedure that should be connected to the phenomenology , our analysis does not provide the definitive answer to which energy should be used to set the cosmological neutrino mass bounds . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , at first glance , our manuscript concerns with introducing the problem of defining observable quantities from a single particle quantum system approach and comparing them with those obtained from a composite quantum system framework .    to summarize , our aim was to establish a debugged correlation between _ averaged_/_weighted _ energy definitions and _ selective_/_non - selective _ quantum measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> generically speaking , it arises when one considers either an ensemble of systems , or a composite quantum system defined when its preparation history is uncertain and one does not know whether it is a pure quantum state or a statistical mixture . </S>",
    "<S> an ensemble of neutrino flavor eigenstates in the cosmological scenario was the example that we have discussed here .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , as it has been extensively discussed , the closure fraction of cold dark matter at present substantially modifies the matter power spectrum , even for neutrinos behaving like hot dark matter at higher redshifts @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that the amount of cold dark matter at earlier epochs should be reduced , suppressing the formation of large scale structures , when it is compared to a situation without massive neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> such a suppression is attenuated at intermediate scales @xcite if neutrinos are treated as hot dark matter . using the correct expression for </S>",
    "<S> neutrino masses can slightly modify the characterization of neutrinos as cold or hot dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore a relevant aspect that has to be included in the procedures for determining the fraction of the neutrino energy density at late times . </S>",
    "<S> our results provide conditions for understanding the background quantum mechanics of such procedures that lead to more accurate phenomenological predictions for the analysis where cosmological neutrino masses are considered .    </S>",
