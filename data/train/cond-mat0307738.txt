    "in view of numerous technological applications and a large variety of phenomena , recent scientific work repeatedly focused on glassy ion conductors . on the one hand",
    ", it is well known that the macroscopic charge transport in these materials results from the diffusion of mobile ions in a basically rigid glassy matrix , on the other , a detailed microscopic picture of this dynamical process is still lacking . one key feature of the dynamics in glassy ion conductors is the non - exponential relaxation of the mobile ions , indicating the complexity of the motion .",
    "for instance , broad loss peaks are found in dielectrical and mechanical relaxation experiments @xcite .",
    "moreover , when the dynamics of the mobile ions are studied by means of advanced nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) techniques , non - exponential correlation functions are observed @xcite . in general , the origin of non - exponential relaxation can be twofold @xcite . in the homogeneous scenario ,",
    "the dynamics of all particles are characterized by the same relaxation function that is intrinsically non - exponential due to a specific mechanism of the motion , e.g. , correlated back - and - forth jumps .",
    "contrarily , in the heterogeneous scenario , all particles relax exponentially , i.e. , there are no correlated back - and - forth jumps , but a distribution of correlation times @xmath1 exists . in our case of a complex motion , one may expect that both homogeneous and heterogeneous dynamics contribute to the non - exponential relaxation .",
    "a strong frequency dependence of the electrical conductivity @xmath2 of ion conductors indicates that back - and - forth motions occur during ionic diffusion @xcite . however , to study a complex motion in detail , it is not sufficient to probe the dynamics at two times , but one has to resort to multi - time correlation functions @xcite .",
    "for example , three - time correlation functions can be used to quantify the extent to which the non - exponential relaxation results from the homogeneous and the heterogeneous scenario , respectively @xcite .",
    "four - time correlation functions allow one to measure the lifetime of dynamical heterogeneities , i.e. , the timescale of exchange processes between fast and slow ions .",
    "two methods have recently proven well suited to record multi - time correlation functions for glassy ion conductors .",
    "while ion dynamics on the @xmath3 timescale can be studied in molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations @xcite , multi - dimensional nmr techniques probe jumps on a timescale of @xmath4 .",
    "specifically , multi - dimensional @xmath5ag nmr experiments showed that a broad rate distribution governs the jumps of silver ions in silver phosphate based glasses @xcite .",
    "hence , both correlated back - and - forth jumps and dynamical heterogeneities indeed contribute to the non - exponentiality .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge the relevance of both contributions has not yet been quantified for glassy ion conductors .",
    "md simulations are an ideal tool to investigate dynamical processes on a microscopic level .",
    "prior work on the origin of the non - exponential relaxation in glassy ion conductors has focused on alkali silicate glasses . for",
    "lithium silicate glasses , it was reported that dynamical heterogeneities contribute to the non - exponential relaxation of the lithium ions where the lifetime of these heterogeneities is limited @xcite .",
    "further , back - and - forth motions on various length scales were observed , including a backward correlation beyond the first neighbor shell at low temperatures @xcite . for sodium",
    "silicate glasses , no evidence for back - and - forth jumps between adjacent sodium sites was found at higher temperatures @xcite .",
    "moreover , several workers demonstrated that , though there is no micro - segregation , the sodium ions follow preferential pathways in the glassy matrix @xcite .",
    "the sodium ions inside these channels show a higher mobility than the ones outside and , hence , dynamical heterogeneities exist @xcite .",
    "in addition , studying examples of ionic trajectories the mechanism of alkali ion migration in silicate glasses was described as  vacancy - like process  @xcite . during a correlated motion of two cations ,",
    "an alkali site is left by one ion an occupied by another .    in the present work ,",
    "we use md simulations to analyze the complex mechanism of ion dynamics in an alkali phosphate glass . in this way , we intend to complement the prior studies on silicate glasses and to compare the nature of ion diffusion in different amorphous materials .",
    "moreover , based on an analysis of novel higher - order correlation functions , new information about this dynamical process is revealed . in detail , the dynamics of non - crystalline lipo@xmath0 is investigated in a temperature range where the motions of the various atomic species strongly decouple upon cooling . while the lithium ionic subsystem can be equilibrated at all chosen temperatures , the diffusion of the phosphorus and the oxygen particles freezes in on the ns - timescale of the simulation .",
    "in other words , the dynamics in the melt and in the glass are studied .",
    "our main goal is to identify the temperature dependent origin of the non - exponential relaxation of the lithium ions . for this purpose , we calculate multi - time correlation functions that link the positions of single ions at subsequent points in time . in this way , we quantify the homogeneous and the heterogeneous contributions to the non - exponential relaxation and measure the lifetime of the dynamical heterogeneities .",
    "since the multi - time correlation functions observed in nmr experiments on solid ion conductors and some of the quantities computed in the present study have a similar information content , a future comparison of the respective results is very promising .",
    "the potential used to describe the interaction of the ions in lipo@xmath0 can be written as the sum of a coulomb and a born - mayer - huggins pair potential @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the distance between two ions of type @xmath8 and type @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the potential parameters , except for @xmath10 , are adopted from the work of karthikeyan et al.@xcite . here , @xmath10 is reduced to obtain a more realistic interatomic distance @xmath11 , cf .  below .",
    "in detail , we use effective charges @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 as well as @xmath15",
    ". the parameters @xmath16 are listed in tab .  1 .",
    "most simulations are performed in the nev ensemble for @xmath17 particles . to take into account the thermal expansion of phosphate glasses , the density is fixed at @xmath18 as compared to @xmath19 observed in experiments at room temperature @xcite .",
    "this approximation for the density at higher temperatures is obtained based on the linear expansion coefficient of lipo@xmath0 glass @xcite .",
    "in addition , we consider systems with @xmath20 and @xmath21 to check for finite size effects .",
    "moreover , some simulations are performed at  constant pressure  to enable a comparison with experimentally determined activation energies .",
    "strictly speaking , we continue doing runs in the nev ensemble , but the size of the simulation box is adjusted so that a pressure @xmath22 is obtained at all temperatures .",
    "this procedure results in a decrease of the density from @xmath23 at @xmath24 to @xmath25 at @xmath26 .",
    "the equations of motion are integrated using the velocity form of the verlet algorithm with a time step of @xmath27 .",
    "further , periodic boundary conditions are applied and the coulombic forces are calculated via ewald summation . in doing so , consistent results are obtained when computing the trajectories with the programme moldy @xcite and an own md simulation programme , respectively .",
    "while the whole system can be equilibrated at @xmath28 , the phosphate glass matrix is basically frozen on the timescale of the simulation at lower temperatures . in the latter cases , we pay attention that the lithium ionic subsystem is still in equilibrium . for example",
    ", the sample is equilibrated for @xmath29 at @xmath30 before recording the data .",

    ", we found that the non - uniformities of the motion are short - lived . in",
    "what follows , we summarize and discuss our results in more detail where the quantities that lead to the respective conclusion are indicated in brackets .",
    "the dynamical heterogeneities at @xmath74 show the following features : ( i ) the distribution of jump rates contributes more to the non - exponentiality the lower the temperature ( @xmath106 , @xmath258 ) .",
    "( ii ) for a given temperature , its contribution is maximum when the lithium ions successfully escape from their sites ( @xmath259 ) .",
    "( iii ) the exchange between the fast and the slow ions of the distribution takes place on the same timescale as the lithium jumps , i.e. , the dynamical heterogeneities are short - lived ( @xmath129 , @xmath260 ) .",
    "in particular , both processes show a similar temperature dependence ( @xmath261 ) .",
    "( iv ) the timescale of the exchange depends on the dynamical state itself ( @xmath260 ) .",
    "( v ) the dynamical heterogeneities mainly result from different jump rates at neighboring sites , but there are also non - uniformities of the motion on a length scale @xmath262 ( @xmath263 ) .",
    "the back - and - forth jumps of the lithium ions in the glass can be characterized as follows : ( i ) correlated back - and - forth jumps occur for the fast ions of the distribution , but not for the slow ions , i.e. , the back - jump probability depends on the initial dynamical state ( @xmath264 , @xmath177 ) .",
    "( ii ) for highly mobile ions , there is a backward correlation even beyond the first neighbor shell ( @xmath177 ) .",
    "well above @xmath75 , dynamical heterogeneities and back - and - forth motions on the length scale @xmath192 are absent ( @xmath177 , @xmath263 ) .",
    "however , due to the temporary caging of the lithium ions by the neighboring particles , anisotropic dynamical heterogeneities and a backward correlation exist on short length- and timescales .",
    "we conclude that the formation of well - defined lithium sites is accompanied by the emergence of correlated back - and - forth jumps and dynamical heterogeneities on a length scale @xmath265 . at the lower temperatures , the non - exponential depopulation of the lithium sites results to a large extent from the dynamical heterogeneities and , hence",
    ", the distribution of jump rates is broad .",
    "the short lifetime of the dynamical heterogeneities implies that sites featuring fast and slow lithium dynamics , respectively , are intimately mixed .",
    "in particular , the absence of long - lived heterogeneities excludes a micro - segregation of the glass into extended clusters in which the lithium ions are mobile and immobile , respectively .",
    "instead , we suggest that the broad distribution of jump rates in lipo@xmath0 glass results from a diversity of the local glass structure at neighboring sites , e.g. , from varying coordination numbers . in this basically random energy landscape , fast ion migration occurs along pathways connecting low energy barriers .",
    "the presence of such channels is not only indicated by the appearance of the lithium trajectories , but also by the existence of long - range dynamical heterogeneities and by the backward correlation beyond the first neighbor shell for the fast ions .",
    "some of our findings are recovered when analyzing the dynamics resulting from schematic models such as the random - barrier and the random - energy model where the particles move in a time - independent , external energy landscape .",
    "for example , the particles migrate along preferential pathways in these models and percolation approaches have been applied to describe the dynamics at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "moreover , the back - jump probability depends on the dynamical state of a particle , e.g. , for the random - barrier model , many back - and - forth jumps occur over low energy barriers , whereas slow ions cross high barriers so that a backward motion is unlikely .",
    "however , other features of the lithium dynamics in lipo@xmath0 glass are not reproduced in schematic models . at variance with our findings , cf .",
    "[ h ] , a straightforward calculation shows that @xmath266 is obtained for these models .",
    "furthermore , we observe that the first maximum of @xmath208 lies at @xmath267 and shifts towards shorter distances when @xmath48 is increased , cf .",
    "fig.[sigma ] .",
    "this means that , in contrast to what is captured in simple models , the energy barriers crossed by the fast lithium ions of the distribution are located at larger distances than the ones overcome by the slow ions .",
    "we speculate that simple hopping models are suited to study the time - independent effects of the glassy matrix on the lithium ionic diffusion , but they fail in modelling the influence of the time - dependent li - li interactions . for example , we want to demonstrate that our findings for the position of the energy barrier can be explained when assuming that the li - li interaction decreases with the waiting @xmath165 at a site due to the adjustment of the neighboring lithium ions . for simplicity , we consider a lithium ion that occupies a site at @xmath268 and experiences a potential @xmath269 . here , the first and the second term are meant to mimic the contribution from the glassy matrix and from the repulsion due to other lithium ions ( @xmath270 ) , respectively . a taylor expansion for @xmath271 shows that the maximum of this potential lies at @xmath272 .",
    "hence , for @xmath273 , this simple model yields a maximum at @xmath274 that is located at smaller distances the larger the value of the waiting time as observed in our simulations .    comparing the results of md simulation studies on phosphate and silicate glasses several similar features of cation dynamics are striking : ( i ) it is widely accepted that cation diffusion at sufficiently low temperatures can be described as a sequence of hopping processes @xcite .",
    "( ii ) @xmath71 consistently shows non - exponential decays that are well described by kww functions with stretching parameters @xmath275 @xcite .",
    "( iii ) dynamical heterogeneities with a limited lifetime exist @xcite that become more pronounced when the temperature is decreased @xcite .",
    "( iv ) fast ion transport along preferential pathways takes place @xcite .",
    "( v ) a high back - jump probability exists for the fast ions of the distribution , but not for the slow ions @xcite . on the other hand , in previous work on sodium silicate glasses @xcite ,",
    "correlated back - and - forth jumps were not observed at somewhat higher temperatures .",
    "however , since , a high back - jump probability exists only for the fast ions at sufficiently low temperatures , the percentage of ions showing correlated back - and - forth jumps may have been too small to be detected in the study by sunyer et al .",
    "@xcite . altogether , though it is to be further clarified to which extent the findings of md simulations reflect the dynamics in a specific system at lower temperatures , the similarity of the simulation results for various interaction potentials suggests that the mechanism of cation dynamics in various glassy ion conductors is highly comparable .    finally , we compare our results with experimental findings .",
    "first , it can be noted that two - time correlation functions of lithium dynamics obtained in experiments and simulations for lipo@xmath0 glass show a similar non - exponentiality .",
    "specifically , the stretching parameter @xmath73 found here compares well to @xmath276 observed in electrical and mechanical relaxation studies @xcite and in multi - dimensional @xmath277li nmr experiments @xcite .",
    "further , in these measurements , an activation energy @xmath278 was obtained for the lithium dynamics . comparing this value with the results of our constant pressure simulations good agreement",
    "is found for @xmath279 , but significant differences must be noted for @xmath65 .",
    "for the moment , it is not clear where the difference between @xmath82 and @xmath83 results from . since",
    "similar deviations were reported in md simulation studies of lisio@xmath35 glass @xcite , one may speculate that they are a consequence of the complexity of ion dynamics in glasses .",
    "in addition , our findings are useful for the interpretation of experimental results on the origin of the non - exponential relaxation of the mobile ions in solid ion conductors .",
    "multi - dimensional @xmath5ag nmr experiments on glassy and crystalline silver ion conductors @xcite showed that the non - exponential silver ionic relaxation is due to the existence of a broad distribution of jump rates rather than to correlated back - and - forth jumps .",
    "on the other hand , the presence of correlated back - and - forth motion is indicated by a frequency dependence of the electrical conductivity @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "we suggest that this apparent discrepancy can be cleared up based on the present results .",
    "specifically , we found that , first , the back - jump probability depends on the dynamical state , see also @xcite , and , second , the contribution of the dynamical heterogeneities to the non - exponentiality increases upon cooling . since @xmath2 is dominated by the fast ions , we expect a disproportional contribution from the correlated back - and - forth jumps of ions in this dynamical state .",
    "in contrast , multi - dimensional nmr experiments probe the behavior of non - fast ions at low temperatures and , hence , if at all , back - and - forth jumps should be of minor relevance .    in summary",
    ", various techniques have to be applied simultaneously to obtain a complete picture of a complex dynamical process such as ion dynamics in solids .",
    "in particular , a further comparison of results obtained in md simulations and in multi - dimensional nmr experiments is very promising since both techniques allow one to study a dynamical process on a microscopic level .",
    "for such a comparison , the multi - time correlation functions @xmath280 , @xmath106 and @xmath260 can be particularly useful , because their information content is similar to the one of the corresponding quantities in nmr experiments .",
    "the author thanks s.  c.  glotzer , a.  heuer and j.  kieffer for a generous grant of computer time and many stimulating discussions .",
    "founding by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( dfg ) in the frame of the emmy - noether programm is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "it is well established for supercooled liquids that , for purely homogeneous and purely heterogeneous relaxation , three - time correlation functions comparable to @xmath106 can be expressed by the corresponding two - time correlation functions @xcite . here , @xmath226 ^ 2 $ ] follows , because no selection is possible for purely homogeneous dynamics .",
    "hence , the dynamics during @xmath130 and @xmath125 , respectively , are statistically independent so that the joint probability for an escape in neither time interval can be written as a product .",
    "if this was not true a dynamically diverse subensemble could be selected based on the motion in the first time interval and , thus , dynamical heterogeneities would exist . for purely heterogeneous dynamics",
    ", the correlation functions result from a superposition of the contributions of exponentially relaxing subensembles . for the subensemble characterized by a correlation time @xmath281",
    ", one has @xmath282 the second equals sign is due to the definition of the exponential function , and the third results , because the relation for purely homogeneous dynamics holds for the exponentially relaxing , undecomposable subensembles .",
    "since @xmath283 is valid for all subensembles , @xmath227 follows .",

    "<S> three - time correlation functions show that the non - exponential relaxation of the lithium ions results from both correlated back - and - forth jumps and the existence of dynamical heterogeneities , i.e. , the presence of a broad distribution of jump rates . a quantitative analysis yields that the contribution of the dynamical heterogeneities to the non - exponential depopulation of the lithium sites increases upon cooling . </S>",
    "<S> further , correlated back - and - forth jumps between neighboring sites are observed for the fast ions of the distribution , but not for the slow ions and , hence , the back - jump probability depends on the dynamical state . </S>",
    "<S> four - time correlation functions indicate that an exchange between fast and slow ions takes place on the timescale of the jumps themselves , i.e. , the dynamical heterogeneities are short - lived . </S>",
    "<S> hence , sites featuring fast and slow lithium dynamics , respectively , are intimately mixed . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a backward correlation beyond the first neighbor shell for highly mobile ions and the presence of long - range dynamical heterogeneities suggest that fast ion migration occurs along preferential pathways in the glassy matrix . in the melt , we find no evidence for correlated back - and - forth motions and dynamical heterogeneities on the length scale of the next - neighbor distance . </S>"
