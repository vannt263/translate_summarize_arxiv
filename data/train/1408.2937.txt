    "however , many interesting dynamical systems which do not preserve lebesgue admit a `` physical '' invariant probability measure : the _ ergodic basin _ of an @xmath19-invariant probability measure @xmath22 is the set of those initial conditions for which time averages converge to the space average for every continuous function @xmath27 , i.e. , the set @xmath28 an invariant probability measure @xmath22 is called _ physical _ if its ergodic basin has positive lebesgue measure .",

    "if the transfer operator has a nonnegative fixed point @xmath87 , then @xmath88 is an absolutely continuous invariant probability measure for @xmath1 and thus ( if ergodic ) a physical measure . in this case , if the eigenvalue @xmath25 for @xmath86 is simple and isolated , ruelle s formula and integration by parts give , @xmath89 note that the residue of @xmath90 at @xmath80 vanishes , because lebesgue measure is the fixed point of @xmath91 , and the manifold is boundaryless , so that @xmath92 , by integration by parts",

    "the result and proof are well known ( and simpler than the analogous arguments in @xcite ) , but we are not aware of any reference .    let @xmath97 be the unit circle , and let @xmath98 be a @xmath99 map which is _ @xmath100-locally expanding , _",

    "to conclude , we justify the three steps :    * proof of step 1 : * we must show that the operators defined for @xmath144 by @xmath145 satisfy @xmath146 .",
    "we start by observing that the number of branches of @xmath73 ( which is just its degree ) does not depend on @xmath122 .",
    "so for any fixed @xmath3 and any @xmath18 , each inverse branch for @xmath147 , for @xmath122 close enough to @xmath3 , can be paired with a well - defined nearby inverse branch @xmath148 . for two such paired branches ,",

    "more open questions are listed in @xcite and @xcite . in particular , the results in @xcite give hope that linear response or its breakdown ( see @xcite and @xcite ) can be studied for ( the two - dimensional ) hnon family , which is transversal , and where continuity of the srb measure in the weak-@xmath337 topology was proved by alves et al .",

    "* ( 17 ) , ( 19 ) ) , we also give candidates for the notion of horizontality for piecewise expanding maps in higher dimensions and piecewise hyperbolic maps .",
    "the main tool in the proof of theorem  [ last ] is a _ tower construction : _ we wish to compare the srb measure of @xmath333 to that of @xmath1 for small @xmath375 . just like in @xcite , we use transfer operators @xmath376 acting on towers , with a projection @xmath377 from the tower to @xmath378 so that @xmath379 , where @xmath86 is the usual transfer operator , and @xmath380 with @xmath88 ( here , @xmath381 is the fixed point of @xmath382 , and @xmath93 is the invariant density of @xmath1 ) . in @xcite , we adapted the tower construction from @xcite ( introduced in @xcite to study random perturbations , for which this version is better suited than the otherwise ubiquitous young towers @xcite ) .",
    "this construction allows in particular to work with banach spaces of continuous functions .",
    "another idea imported from @xcite is the use of operators @xmath383 acting on truncated towers , where the truncation level @xmath11 must be chosen carefully depending on @xmath375 . roughly speaking , the idea is that @xmath1 is comparable to @xmath333 for @xmath11 iterates ( corresponding to the @xmath11 lowest levels of the respective towers ) , this is the notion of an _",

    "we now move to the differences between @xcite and @xcite : using a tower with exponentially decaying levels as in @xcite or @xcite would provide at best an upper modulus of continuity @xmath390 for @xmath391 , and would not yield any lower bound . for this reason , we use instead `` fat towers '' with _ polynomially decaying _ sizes in @xcite , working with polynomially recurrent maps . in order to construct the corresponding parameter set",
