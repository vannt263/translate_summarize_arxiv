    "since theoretical arguments and observational data suggest that the universe passed through an early - times inflationary stage and resulted in a late - times accelerated phase , a large amount of research was devoted to explain this behavior . in general , one can follow two ways to achieve it .",
    "the first direction is to alter the universe content by introducing additional fields , canonical scalar , phantom scalar , both scalars , vector fields etc , that is introducing the concepts of the inflaton and/or the dark energy , which can be extended in a huge class of models ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the second way is to modify the gravitational sector instead ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "note however that one can in principle transform from one approach to the other , since the important point is the number of degrees of freedom beyond standard model particles and general relativity ( gr ) @xcite",
    ".    in modified gravitational theories one usually extends the curvature - based einstein - hilbert action .",
    "however , a different and interesting class of gravitational modification arises when one extends the action of the equivalent torsional formulation of general relativity .",
    "in particular , since einstein s years it was known that one can construct the so - called `` teleparallel equivalent of general relativity '' ( tegr ) @xcite , that is attributing gravity to torsion instead of curvature , by using instead of the torsion - less levi - civita connection the curvature - less weitzenbck one .",
    "in such a formulation the gravitational lagrangian results from contractions of the torsion tensor and is called the `` torsion scalar '' @xmath1 , similarly to the general relativity lagrangian , i.e. the `` curvature scalar '' @xmath6 , which is constructed by contractions of the curvature tensor . hence , similarly to the @xmath7 extensions of general relativity @xcite",
    ", one can construct @xmath8 extensions of tegr @xcite . the interesting feature in this extension",
    "is that @xmath8 does not coincide with @xmath7 gravity , despite the fact that tegr coincides with general relativity . since it is a new gravitational modification class , its corresponding cosmological behavior and black hole solutions have been studied in detail @xcite .",
    "however , apart from the simple modifications of curvature gravity , one can construct more complicated actions introducing higher - curvature corrections such as the gauss - bonnet combination @xmath9 @xcite or arbitrary functions @xmath10 @xcite , weyl combinations @xcite , lovelock combinations @xcite etc .",
    "hence , one can follow the same direction starting from the teleparallel formulation of gravity , and construct actions involving higher - torsion corrections .",
    "indeed , in our recent work @xcite we first constructed the teleparallel equivalent of the gauss - bonnet term @xmath11 ( which is a new quartic torsional scalar which reduces to a topological invariant in four dimensions ) , and then , using also the torsion scalar @xmath1 , we constructed @xmath0 gravity ( see @xcite for different constructions of torsional actions ) .",
    "this is a new class of gravitational modification , since it is different from both @xmath8 gravity as well as from @xmath12 gravity .    since @xmath0 gravity is a novel modified gravity theory , in the present work we are interested in investigating its cosmological applications . in particular , after extracting the friedmann equations , we define the effective dark energy sector and the various observables such as the density parameters and the dark energy equation - of - state parameter .",
    "then , considering specific @xmath0 ansatzes we investigate the inflation realization and the late - times acceleration .",
    "the plan of the work is as follows : in section [ model ] we review @xmath0 gravity . in section [ fcosmo ]",
    "we apply it in a cosmological framework , extracting the corresponding equations and defining the various observables , while in section [ speccases ] we analyze some specific cases .",
    "finally , section [ conclusions ] is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "let us give a brief review of @xmath0 gravity @xcite .",
    "although in this manuscript we are interested in its cosmological application , we will present the formulation in @xmath13-dimensions where it is non - trivial , and then discuss @xmath0 gravity in @xmath14 . in the teleparallel formulation of gravity theories , the dynamical variables are the vielbein field @xmath15 and the connection 1-forms @xmath16",
    "which defines the parallel transportation ... run over all space - time coordinates , while latin indices @xmath17 ... run over the tangent space . ] .",
    "we can express them in components in terms of coordinates as @xmath18 and @xmath19 , while we define the dual vielbein as @xmath20 .",
    "the vielbein commutation relations read @xmath21=c^{c}_{\\,\\,\\,ab}e_{c}\\ , , \\label{ghw}\\ ] ] where the structure coefficients functions @xmath22 are written as @xmath23 with a comma denoting differentiation .",
    "thus , we can define the torsion tensor , expressed in tangent components as @xmath24 while the curvature tensor is @xmath25 furthermore , we use the metric tensor @xmath26 to make the vielbein orthonormal @xmath27 , where @xmath28 , and thus we obtain the useful relation @xmath29 and indices @xmath30 are raised / lowered with the minkowski metric @xmath31 .",
    "finally , it proves convenient to define the contorsion tensor as @xmath32    we now impose the condition of teleparallelism , namely @xmath33 , which holds in all frames .",
    "one way to realize this condition is by assuming the weitzenbck connection @xmath34 defined in terms of the vielbein in all coordinate frames as @xmath35 , or expressed in the preferred tangent - space components as @xmath36 .",
    "the ricci scalar @xmath37 corresponding to the usual levi - civita connection can be expressed as @xcite @xmath38 where we have defined the `` torsion scalar '' @xmath1 as @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "one can now clearly see that the lagrangian density @xmath41 of general relativity , that is the one calculated with the levi - civita connection , and the torsional density @xmath42 differ only by a total derivative .",
    "hence , the einstein - hilbert action @xmath43 up to boundary terms is equivalent to the action @xmath44 in the sense that varying ( [ genrelaction ] ) with respect to the metric and varying ( [ teleaction ] ) with respect to the vielbein gives rise to the same equations of motion ( @xmath45 is the @xmath13-dimensional gravitational constant ) @xcite .",
    "that is why the above theory , where one uses torsion to describe the gravitational field and imposes the teleparallelism condition , was dubbed by einstein as teleparallel equivalent of general relativity ( tegr ) .",
    "the recipe of the construction of tegr was to express the ricci scalar @xmath6 corresponding to a general connection as the ricci scalar @xmath37 calculated with the levi - civita connection , plus terms arising from the torsion tensor .",
    "then , by imposing the teleparallelism condition @xmath46 , we obtained that @xmath37 is equal to a torsion scalar plus a total derivative .",
    "hence , we can follow the same steps , but using the gauss - bonnet combination @xmath47 instead of the ricci scalar . in @xcite",
    "we have derived the teleparallel equivalent of gauss - bonnet gravity characterized by the new torsion scalar @xmath2 , as well as the equations of motion of the modified gravity defined by the function @xmath3 . in the following ,",
    "we give the corresponding expressions when restricted to the weitzenbck connection @xmath48 ( the tildes are withdrawn for notational simplicity ) .",
    "it is @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the gauss - bonnet term calculated by the levi - civita connection , and @xmath51 with the generalized @xmath52 being the determinant of the kronecker deltas .",
    "thus , @xmath11 is the teleparallel equivalent of @xmath50 , in the sense that the action @xmath53 varied in terms of the vielbein gives exactly the same equations with the action @xmath54 varied in terms of the metric .",
    "having constructed the teleparallel equivalent of curvature invariants , one can be based on them in order to build modified gravitational theories .",
    "thus , one can start from an action where @xmath1 is generalized to @xmath4 , resulting to the so - called @xmath4 gravity @xcite .",
    "similarly , one can extend @xmath11 to @xmath55 in the action , and since @xmath11 is quartic in torsion then @xmath55 can not arise from any @xmath4 .",
    "hence , in @xcite we combined both possible extensions and we constructed the @xmath0 modified gravity @xmath56 which is clearly different from both @xmath4 theory as well as from @xmath5 gravity @xcite , and therefore it is novel gravitational modification .",
    "we mention that tegr ( and therefore gr ) is obtained for @xmath57 , while the usual einstein - gauss - bonnet theory arises for @xmath58 , with @xmath59 the gauss - bonnet coupling .",
    "let us now give the equations of motion in @xmath14 which is our main interest in the present paper .",

    "we close this section by making some comments on @xmath0 modified gravity itself , before proceeding to its cosmological investigation .",
    "the first has to do with the lorentz violation .",
    "in particular , as we discussed also in @xcite , under the use of the weitzenbck connection the torsion scalar @xmath1 remains diffeomorphism invariant , however the lorentz invariance has been lost since we have chosen a specific class of frames , namely the autoparallel orthonormal frames .",
    "nevertheless , the equations of motion of the lagrangian @xmath69 , being the einstein equations , are still lorentz covariant . on the contrary , when we replace @xmath1 by a general function @xmath8 in the action ,",
    "the new equations of motion will not be covariant under lorentz rotations of the vielbein , although they will indeed be form - invariant , and the same features appear in the @xmath0 extension .",
    "however , this is not a deficit ( it is a sort of analogue of gauge fixing in gauge theories ) , and the theory , although not lorentz covariant , is meaningful .",
    "definitely , not all vielbeins will be solutions of the equations of motion , but those which solve the equations will determine the metric uniquely .",
    "the second comment is related to possible acausalities and problems with the cauchy development of a constant - time hypersurface .",
    "indeed , there are works claiming that a departure from tegr , as for instance in @xmath8 gravity , with the subsequent local lorentz violation , will lead to the above problems @xcite . in order to examine",
    "whether one also has these problems in the present scenario of @xmath0 gravity , he would need to perform a very complicated analysis , extending the characteristics method of @xcite for this case , although at first sight one does expect to indeed find them .",
    "nevertheless , even if this proves to be the case , it does not mean that the theory has to be ruled out , since one could still handle @xmath8 gravity ( and similarly @xmath0 one ) as an effective theory , in the regime of validity of which the extra degrees of freedom can be removed or be excited in a healthy way ( alternatively one could reformulate the theory using lagrange multipliers ) @xcite .",
    "however , there is a possibility that these problems might be related to the restricting use of the weitzenbck connection , since the formulation of tegr and its modifications using other connections ( still in the `` teleparallel class '' ) does not seem to be problematic , and thus , the general formulation of @xmath0 gravity that was presented in @xcite might be free of the above disadvantages .",
    "these issues definitely need further investigation , and the discussion is still open in the literature .",
    "in this section we apply @xmath0 gravity in a cosmological framework .",
    "firstly , we add the matter sector along the gravitational one , that is we start by the total action @xmath70 where @xmath71 corresponds to a matter energy - momentum tensor @xmath72 and @xmath73 is the four - dimensional newton s constant . secondly , in order to investigate the cosmological implications of the above action",
    ", we consider a spatially flat cosmological ansatz @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the scale factor and @xmath76 is the lapse function ( the hat indices run in the three spatial coordinates ) .",
    "this metric arises from the diagonal vierbein @xmath77 through ( [ metrdef ] ) , while the dual vierbein is @xmath78 , and its determinant @xmath79 .",
    "considering as usual @xmath80 and inserting the vierbein ( [ vierbeincosmo ] ) into relations ( [ tscalar ] ) and ( [ tg ] ) , we find @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the hubble parameter and dots denote differentiation with respect to @xmath83 . additionally , inserting ( [ vierbeincosmo ] ) into the general equations of motion ( [ genequations ] ) , after some algebra we obtain the friedmann equations @xmath84 @xmath85 where the right hand sides arise from the independent variation of the matter action , considering it to correspond to a perfect fluid with energy density @xmath86 and pressure @xmath87 ( it is @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) . in the above expressions it is @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , with @xmath94 , @xmath95 , ... denoting multiple partial differentiations of @xmath96 with respect to @xmath1 , @xmath2 .",
    "finally , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , @xmath100 are obtained by differentiating ( [ tcosmo ] ) and ( [ tgcosmo ] ) respectively with respect to time .",
    "let us make a comment here on the derivation of the above friedmann equations .",
    "we mention that we followed the robust way , that is we first performed the general variation of the action resulting to the general equations of motion ( [ genequations ] ) , and then we inserted the cosmological ansatz ( [ vierbeincosmo ] ) , obtaining ( [ eqmn ] ) and ( [ eqma ] ) .",
    "this procedure in principle does not give the same results with the shortcut procedure where one first inserts the cosmological ansatz ( [ vierbeincosmo ] ) in the action and then performs variation with respect to @xmath101 and @xmath102 , since variation and ansatz - insertion do not commute in general , especially in theories with higher - order derivatives @xcite .",
    "this shortcut method is a sort of minisuperspace procedure since the ( potential ) additional degrees of freedom other than those contained in the scale factor are frozen .",
    "however , as we show in the appendix , following the shortcut procedure in the cosmological application of the scenario at hand leads exactly to the two friedmann equations ( [ eqmn ] ) and ( [ eqma ] ) of the robust procedure .    setting @xmath103 in equations ( [ eqmn ] ) , ( [ eqma ] ) , we get the standard cosmological equations of general relativity without a cosmological constant . for @xmath104",
    "we get @xmath105 @xmath106 which are recognized as the standard equations of @xmath4 gravity .",
    "however , note that due to the various conventions adopted in the literature in the definitions of the riemann tensor , the torsion tensor and the minkowski metric , which may differ by a total sign , our function @xmath4 may correspond to @xmath107 in some other works ( for instance @xcite ) .    in order to parametrize the deviation of the theory @xmath3 from gr , we write @xmath108 .",
    "thus , the modification of gr ( for instance the effective dark energy component ) is included in the function @xmath109 . equations ( [ eqmn ] ) , ( [ eqma ] )",
    "are then written as @xmath110 @xmath111 the friedmann equations ( [ vgy ] ) , ( [ gyw ] ) can be rewritten in the usual form @xmath112 where the energy density and pressure of the effective dark energy sector are defined as @xmath113\\ , .",

    "in the previous section we extracted the friedmann equations of general @xmath3 cosmology , and we defined the effective dark energy sector .",
    "thus , in this section we proceed to the investigation of some specific @xmath3 cases , focusing on the evolution of observables such as the various density parameters @xmath119 and the dark energy equation - of - state parameter @xmath120 .    [",
    "[ ftt_g - tbeta_1sqrtt2beta_2t_galpha_1t2alpha_2tsqrtt_g ] ]      since @xmath11 contains quartic torsion terms , it will in general and approximately be of the same order with @xmath122 . therefore , @xmath1 and @xmath123 are of the same order , and thus , if one of them contributes during the evolution the other will contribute too .",
    "therefore , it would be very interesting to consider modifications of the form @xmath124 , which are expected to play an important role at late times .",
    "note that the couplings @xmath125 are dimensionless , and so , no new mass scale enters at late times .",
    "nevertheless , in order to describe the early - times cosmology , one should additionally include higher order corrections like @xmath126 .",
    "since the scalar @xmath2 is of the same order with @xmath126 , it should be also included .",
    "however , since @xmath2 is topological in four dimensions it can not be included as it is , and therefore we use the term @xmath127 which is also of the same order with @xmath126 and non - trivial .",
    "thus , the total function @xmath96 is taken to be @xmath128 in summary , when the above function is used as an action , it gives rise to a gravitational theory that can describe both inflation and late - times acceleration in a unified way .    in order to examine the cosmological evolution of a universe governed by the above unified action",

    "however , as it is usual in modified gravity @xcite , the model at hand can describe the phantom regime too , for a region of the parameter space , which is an additional advantage .",
    "in particular , in fig . [ darkenergy.phantom ] we depict the cosmological evolution for a parameter choice that leads @xmath120 to the phantom regime , while the density parameters maintain their observed behavior .",
    "similarly , note that the scenario can also exhibit the phantom - divide crossing @xcite too .",
    "finally , note that one can use dynamical - systems methods in order to examine in a systematic way the late - times cosmological behavior of the scenario at hand , independently of the initial conditions of the universe @xcite .",
    "one can go beyond the simple model of the previous paragraph .",
    "in particular , since as we already mentioned @xmath11 contains quartic torsion terms , it will in general and approximately be of the same order with @xmath122 . therefore , it would be interesting to consider modifications of the form @xmath155 .",

    "the significant advantage is that the exponential expansion is obtained without an explicit cosmological constant term in the action .",
    "again , this was expected since we can easily extract analytical solutions of the friedmann equations ( [ fr1a22 ] ) , ( [ fr2s22 ] ) with @xmath139 const ( in which case @xmath1 and @xmath11 as also constants ) .",
    "additionally , note that in this case the inflation realization is more efficient comparing to the model of the previous subsection , since it leads to more e - foldings in less time , as expected since now higher - order torsion terms are considered .    in the above analysis we showed that @xmath173 cosmology can be very efficient in describing the evolution of the universe at the background level .",
    "however , before considering any cosmological model as a candidate for the description of nature it is necessary to perform a detailed investigation of its perturbations , namely to examine whether the obtained solutions are stable .",
    "furthermore , especially in theories with local lorentz invariance violation , new degrees of freedom are introduced , the behavior of which is not guaranteed that is stable ( for instance this is the case in the initial version of hoava - lifshitz gravity @xcite , in the initial version of de rham - gabadadze - tolley massive gravity @xcite , etc ) , and this makes the perturbation analysis of such theories even more imperative .",
    "although such a detailed and complete analysis of the cosmological perturbations of @xmath173 gravity is necessary , its various complications and lengthy calculations make it more convenient to be examined in a separate project @xcite .",
    "however , for the moment we would like to mention that in the case of simple @xmath8 gravity , the perturbations of which have been examined in detail @xcite , one does obtain instabilities , but there are many classes of @xmath8 ansantzes and/or parameter - space regions , where the perturbations are well - behaved .",
    "this is a good indication that we could expect to find a similar behavior in @xmath173 gravity too , although we need to indeed verify this under the detailed perturbation analysis .",
    "in this work we investigated the cosmological applications of @xmath0 gravity , which is a modified gravity based on the torsion scalar @xmath1 and the teleparallel equivalent of the gauss - bonnet combination @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath0 gravity is different from both the simple @xmath4 theory , as well as from the curvature modification @xmath5 , and thus it is a novel class of gravitational modification .",
    "first , we extracted the general friedmann equations and we defined the effective dark energy sector consisting of torsional combinations .",
    "then , choosing specific @xmath0 ansatzes we performed a detailed study of various observables , such as the matter and dark energy density parameters and the dark energy equation - of - state parameters .    amongst the huge number of possible ansatzes , an interesting option is",
    "the construction of terms of the same order as @xmath1 or @xmath122 using @xmath11 , for instance new combinations of the form @xmath174 or @xmath175 can participate in the @xmath0 function .",
    "the resulting cosmology leads to interesting behaviors .",
    "firstly , the scenario can describe the inflationary regime , without an inflaton field .",
    "secondly , at late times it provides an effective dark energy sector which can drive the acceleration of the universe , along with the correct evolution of the density parameters , without the need of a cosmological constant .",
    "furthermore , the dark energy equation - of - state parameter can be quintessence or phantom - like , or experiences the phantom - divide crossing , depending on the parameters of the model .",
    "another possible ansatz is the @xmath155 , the simplest application of which can also easily lead to inflationary behavior .",
    "these features make the proposed modified gravity a good candidate for the description of nature .",

    "in this appendix we follow the shortcut procedure in order to derive the field equations of @xmath0 cosmology . in particular , instead of performing the variation of the action ( [ fgbtelaction ] ) in terms of the general vierbein , obtaining the general field equations ( [ genequations ] ) , and then insert into them the cosmological vierbein ansatz ( [ vierbeincosmo ] ) , we will first insert the cosmological vierbein ansatz into the action and then perform the variation in terms of the scale factor @xmath75 and the lapse function @xmath76 .",
    "although in principle the shortcut procedure is not guaranteed that it will give the same results as the first robust method @xcite , especially when the action involves higher - order derivatives , in this specific example it proves that we do obtain the same results indeed .",
