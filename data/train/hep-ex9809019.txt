    "an important goal in the study of high energy hard collision properties is the detailed understanding of the hadronic final state and its characteristic jet structure .",
    "perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) calculations have been used to describe the production of jet final states .",
    "however , the jet structure still relies on phenomenological models to describe how the partonic cascade evolves into the final state of hadrons .    in the picture implemented in monte carlo ( mc )",
    "simulations , it is assumed that first the primarily produced partons from the hard scatter evolve via softer gluon and quark emission according to pqcd into jets of partons .",
    "this process continues until a cut - off @xmath4 scale ( @xmath5  gev ) is reached as pqcd calculations are valid for @xmath6 . after this phase , non - perturbative processes take over which  cluster \" the final partons into color singlet hadronic states via a mechanism described by phenomenological fragmentation models , like the lund ",
    "string\"@xcite or the  cluster\"@xcite fragmentation model .",
    "these models usually involve quite a number of _ a priori _ unknown parameters that need to be tuned to the data .    a different and purely analytical approach giving quantitative predictions of hadronic spectra",
    "is based on the concept of  local parton hadron duality \" ( lphd)@xcite . the key assumption of this hypothesis is that the particle yield is described by a parton cascade where the conversion of partons into hadrons occurs at a low virtuality scale , of the order of hadronic masses ( @xmath7  mev ) , independent of the scale of the primary hard process , and involves only low - momentum transfers ; it is assumed that the results obtained for partons apply to hadrons as well .",
    "this correspondence of the partonic properties to the hadronic ones should only be considered in an inclusive and average sense .",
    "lphd may be connected to pre - confinement properties of qcd which ensure that color charges are compensated locally@xcite . according to the preconfinement idea ,",
    "color singlet clusters are formed during that phase .",
    "these clusters evolve into hadronic clusters via a smooth transformation such that local properties remain conserved in an average sense . with lphd ,",
    "only two essential parameters are involved in the perturbative description : the effective qcd scale @xmath8 and a ( transverse momentum ) cut - off parameter @xmath9 , resulting in a highly constrained theoretical framework ; non - perturbative effects are essentially reduced to normalization constants . within the lphd approach ,",
    "pqcd calculations have been carried out in the simplest case ( high energy limit ) in the double log approximation ( dla)@xcite , or in the modified leading log approximation ( mlla)@xcite , which includes higher order terms of relative order @xmath10 ( e.g. , finite energy corrections ) that are essential for quantitative agreement with data at present energies .",
    "coherence phenomenon is an intrinsic property of qcd ( and in fact of any gauge theory ) .",
    "its observation is important in the study of strong interactions and in the search for deviations from the standard model .",
    "color coherence phenomena in the final state have been very well established from early 80 s in @xmath0 annihilations@xcite , in what has been termed the `` string''@xcite or `` drag''@xcite effect .",
    "particle production in the region between the quark and antiquark jets in @xmath11 events is suppressed . in pqcd",
    "such effects arise from interference between the soft gluons radiated from the @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 . while quantum mechanical interference effects are expected in qcd , it is important to investigate whether such effects survive the non - perturbative hadronization process , for a variety of reactions over a broad kinematic range , as predicted by lphd .",
    "it is instructive to separate the color coherence phenomena into two regions : the intjet and intjet coherence@xcite .",
    "the intrajet coherence deals with the coherent effects in partonic cascades , resulting on the average , in the angular ordering ( ao ) of the sequential parton branches which give rise to the _ hump - backed _ shape of particle spectra inside qcd jets .",
    "the interjet coherence is responsible for the string / drag effect and deals with the angular structure of soft particle flows when three or more energetic partons are involved in the hard process .",
    "the ao approximation is an important consequence of color coherence .",
    "it results in the suppression of soft gluon radiation in the partonic cascade in certain regions of phase space . for the case of outgoing partons",
    ", ao requires that the emission angles of soft gluons decrease monotonically as the partonic cascade evolves away from the hard process .",
    "the radiation is confined to a cone centered on the direction of one parton , and is bounded by the direction of its color  connected partner . outside this region",
    "the interference of different emission diagrams becomes destructive and the azimuthally integrated amplitude vanishes to leading order .",
    "mc simulations including coherence effects probabilistically by means of ao are available for both initial and final state evolutions .",
    "another way to incorporate coherence effects in parton shower event generators is by using the color dipole cascade model , implemented in the ariadne@xcite mc program .",
    "the ao is an important element of the dla and mlla analytic pqcd calculations , which provides the probabilistic interpretation of soft - gluon cascades .",
    "in fact beyond the mlla a probabilistic picture of the parton cascade evolution is not feasible due to @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 is the number of colors ) suppressed soft interference contributions that appear in the higher - order calculations@xcite .    in this report",
    "we present current experimental results on observables that test the lphd hypothesis in the context of color coherence phenomena from @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and  collisions .",
    "the study of multiparticle production in hard collision processes can yield valuable information about the characteristic features of the partonic branching processes in qcd and the transition from colored partons to colorless hadrons .",
    "it is of great importance to know whether a smooth transition exists between a purely perturbative regime and the soft momentum region .",
    "recent results on particle production are discussed in this section .      a striking prediction of the perturbative approach to qcd jet physics is the depletion of soft particle production and the resulting approximately gaussian shape of the inclusive distribution in the variable @xmath17 for particles with momentum @xmath18 in a jet of energy @xmath19the famous `` hump - back plateau '' ( see ref . [ 18 ] and earlier references therein ) . due to the _ intrajet _ coherence of gluon radiation ( resulting on the average in the ao of sequential branching ) , not the softest partons but those with intermediate energies ( @xmath20 ) multiply most effectively in qcd cascades .    according to the expectations of the mlla+lphd the inclusive momentum spectra of hadrons produced",
    "is given by :    @xmath21    where    @xmath22    the function @xmath23 is the mlla formula for the number of final state partons per unit @xmath24 per event and is approximately gaussian in @xmath24 .",
    "to check the validity of the mlla+lphd approach , it is interesting to study the energy evolution of the maximum , @xmath25 , of the @xmath24 distribution .",
    "the prediction of the dependency of @xmath25 on the center of mass energy can be expressed as ( see ref . [",
    "17 ] and earlier references therein ) :    @xmath26    where    @xmath27    with @xmath28 the number of quark flavors and @xmath29 a function that depends on the hadron type , @xmath30 , through the ratio @xmath31 :    @xmath32    the shapes of the measured particle energy spectra in @xmath0 annihilation from early 90 s have been surprisingly close , over the whole momentum range down to momenta of a few hundred mev , to the mlla+lphd predictions .",
    "these observations can be taken as evidence that the perturbative phase of the cascade development indeed leaves its imprint on the final state hadrons supporting the hypothesis that color coherence effects survive the hadronization process as suggested by lphd .",
    "recently , new data on charged particle spectra , exploring higher energy regimes , have become available from lep , hera , and tevatron .",
    "the hera experiments concentrate on the  current \" fragmentation region in dis ( fragmentation products of the outgoing quark ) and perform the analysis in the breit frame , where the exchanged boson is completely spacelike .",
    "the dis current fragmentation functions at a momentum transfer @xmath33 are analogous to the @xmath0 fragmentation functions at center of mass energy equal to @xmath33@xcite .",
    "the new data confirm with much increased statistical significance the features observed in @xmath0 : approximately gaussian shape of the @xmath24 spectra with peak - position and width increasing with @xmath33 as predicted in mlla .",
    "figure  [ zeus_frag]a shows preliminary @xmath24 distributions for charged particles in the current fragmentation region of the breit frame as a function of @xmath33 from zeus .",
    "these distributions are approximately gaussian in shape with mean charged multiplicity given by the integral of the distributions . as @xmath33 increases the multiplicity increases and the peak of the distribution shifts to larger values of @xmath24 ( i.e. , smaller values of momenta ) .",
    "figure  [ zeus_frag]b shows this peak position , @xmath34 , as a function of q for the zeus data and of @xmath35 for the @xmath0 data . over the range shown the peak moves from @xmath36  1.5 to 3.3 .",
    "the zeus data points are consistent with those from tasso and topaz and a clear agreement in the rate of growth of the zeus points with the opal data at higher @xmath33 is observed . from fig .",
    "[ zeus_frag]b it is clear that the zeus data are incompatible with the assumption of an incoherent branching picture or a simple phase - space model ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "zeus also fitted the mlla predictions ( eq .  [ eq3 ] ) to their @xmath25 evolution data , assuming @xmath38 , and extracted a value of @xmath39  mev which is in agreement with a similar value obtained from h1 , cdf , or combined @xmath0 data . notice that decreasing @xmath9 means extending the responsibility of the perturbative stage beyond its formal range of applicability .",
    "however , in mlla calculations this limit is smooth yielding a finite result even if the coupling gets arbitrarily large .",
    "figures  [ h1_frag ] and [ l3_frag ] show similar distributions from the h1 and l3 experiments",
    ". a simultaneous mlla fit to the peak and width values obtained from the present h1 data alone yields a value of @xmath40  gev@xcite . from fig .",
    "[ l3_frag]b we see that the dla calculations clearly disagree with the @xmath0 data .",
    "the finite energy corrections included in the mlla predictions seem important .",
    "we also notice that the value of @xmath25 at the @xmath41 corresponds to the rather low momenta @xmath42 or @xmath43  gev ( fig .",
    "[ l3_frag]a ) .",
    "confirmation of the mlla+lphd approach has also been presented by cdf .",
    "this experiment studies charged particle momentum distributions in subsamples of dijet events . for fixed dijet masses in the range @xmath44 gev / c@xmath45 , the @xmath24 distribution of tracks , within cones of various opening angle @xmath46 ( with respect to the jet axis ) , is studied ( see fig .",
    "[ cdf_frag]a ) . as dijet mass @xmath47 jet opening angle increases , the peak of the spectrum , @xmath48 , shifts towards larger values of @xmath24 in perfect agreement with the @xmath0 data , as shown in fig .",
    "[ cdf_frag]b .",
    "the mlla fit ( superimposed in fig .",
    "[ cdf_frag]b ) is in excellent agreement with the data and yields @xmath49  mev , confirming that in this approximation the domain of pqcd extends down to @xmath50 .",
    "similar analyses should be possible in dis and photoproduction at hera but have not yet been attempted .",
    "the @xmath24-spectra for a variety of identified particles / resonances has been studied at the @xmath41 pole at slac and at lep .",
    "recently the sld collaboration has reported measurements of the differential production cross sections as a function of @xmath51 of several identified hadron and antihadron species in inclusive hadronic @xmath41 decays , as well as separately for @xmath41 decays into light ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 flavors@xcite .",
    "these results have been compared to mlla as well as the predictions of three fragmentation models .",
    "the fitted peak positions @xmath25 for the various particles are plotted as a function of the hadron mass in fig .",
    "[ sld_frag ] , along with averages of similar measurements from experiments at lep@xcite , with which they are consistent .",
    "the distribution for pions peaks at a higher @xmath24 value than those of the other hadron species , but otherwise there is no obvious mass - dependence .",
    "indicates that the peak position @xmath25 decreases as a function of mass differently for baryons and mesons .",
    "these results may provide additional insights concerning the lphd concept .",
    "] we notice that within the framework of the mlla+lphd picture there is no recipe for relating the @xmath9 cut - off parameter to the masses of the produced hadrons and their quantum numbers .",
    "the delphi collaboration has recently reported preliminary results on the production of charged and neutral kaons , protons , and @xmath8s at center of mass energies above the @xmath41 pole.@xcite .",
    "the data are found to be in good agreement with the mlla predictions .",
    "this comparison confirms the perturbative expectation ( eq .",
    "[ eq3 ] ) that for different particle species the energy dependence of @xmath25 is universal .",
    "the fit of the data points to expression ( [ eq3 ] ) , where @xmath57 was taken as a free parameter and @xmath8 was fixed to 150 mev ( this value comes from the description of the pion spectra with @xmath58 ) yielded a value for @xmath9 of about 330  mev consistent for the different particle types .",
    "the analytical perturbative approach allows one to predict the limit of the one - particle invariant density in qcd jets @xmath59 at very small momenta @xmath18 or , equivalently , in the limit of vanishing rapidity and transverse momentum@xcite .",
    "if the dual description of hadronic and partonic states is adequate down to very small momenta , a finite , energy - independent limit of the invariant hadronic density , @xmath60 , is expected .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the color coherence in soft gluon branching . indeed ,",
    "long wavelength gluons are emitted by the total conserved color current , which is independent of the internal structure of a jet and its energy .",
    "a possible rise of @xmath60 with center - of - mass energy would indicate that either coherence or the lphd ( or both ) break down . since color coherence is a general property of qcd as a gauge theory , it is the lphd concept that is tested in measurements of the soft hadrons .",
    "the @xmath0 annihilation data on charged and identified particle inclusive spectra have been found to follow the mlla prediction surprisingly well , also at low center - of - mass energies .",
    "the invariant spectra at low momentum scale approximately ( within 10% ) between 1.6 and 161  gev and agree with perturbative calculations which become very sensitive to the strong running of @xmath61 at small scales  @xcite .",
    "the h1 collaboration has reported the first breit frame measurements of the invariant energy spectra in dis as a function of @xmath33@xcite .",
    "for sufficiently high @xmath33 , the data show that the low - momentum limit in that region of phase space is essentially independent of @xmath33 and indeed similar to that in @xmath0 annihilation .",
    "the study of coherence effects in hadron ",
    "hadron collisions is considerably more subtle than that in @xmath0 annihilations due to the presence of colored constituents in both the initial and final states . during a hard interaction , color",
    "is transferred from one parton to another and the color  connected partons act as color antennae , with interference effects taking place in the initial or final states , or between the initial and final states .",
    "gluon radiation from the incoming and outgoing partons forms jets of hadrons around the direction of these colored emitters .",
    "the soft gluon radiation pattern accompanying any hard partonic system can be represented , to leading order in @xmath62 as a sum of contributions corresponding to the color  connected partons . within the perturbative calculations ,",
    "this is a direct consequence of interferences between the radiation of various color emitters , resulting in the qcd coherence effects @xcite .",
    "both the cdf@xcite and d@xcite collaborations have measured spatial correlations between the softer third jet and the second leading-@xmath63 jet in @xmath64 events to explore the initial - to - final state coherence effects in interactions .    in the 0  analysis",
    "the jets were reconstructed using a fixed - cone clustering algorithm with 0.5 cone radius .",
    "the corrected transverse energy of the highest-  jet of the event was required to be above 115 gev while the third jet was required to have @xmath65 gev .",
    "the interference between the second and the third jet is displayed using the polar variables @xmath66 and @xmath67 ; where @xmath68 and @xmath69 , in a search disk of @xmath70 .",
    "( pseudorapidity @xmath71 $ ] , where @xmath72 is the polar angle of the jet with respect to the proton beam . )",
    "figure  [ pl_fig4 ] shows the ratio of the @xmath73 distributions for the 0  data relative to several mc predictions for both central ( @xmath74 ) and forward ( @xmath75 ) regions .",
    "detector position and energy resolution effects have been included in the mc simulations .",
    "the absence of color interference effects in isajet@xcite results in a disagreement with the 0  @xmath73 distributions .",
    "the data show a clear enhancement of events compared to near the event plane ( i.e. , the plane defined by the directions of the second jet and the beam axis , @xmath76 ) and a depletion in the transverse plane ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation from initial  to  final state color interference that the rate of soft jet emission around the event plane be enhanced with respect to the transverse plane .",
    "however , 5.8@xcite which contains initial and final state interference effects implemented by means of the ao approximation of the parton cascade , agrees well with the data .",
    "the 0  data have also been compared to 5.7@xcite which also simulates the color interference effects with the ao approximation .",
    "the predictions include string fragmentation .",
    "without ao the distributions are significantly different from the data , while with ao turned on there is much better agreement , although there are still some residual differences in the `` near beam '' region .",
    "finally , the @xmath78 tree - level qcd prediction from jetrad@xcite describes the coherence effects seen in the data in both @xmath79 regions .      in @xmath81 events ,",
    "the angular distribution of soft gluons about the colorless @xmath80 boson is expected to be uniform , while the distribution around the jet is expected to have structure due to the colored partons in the jet .",
    "0  studies these effects by comparing the distributions of soft particles around the @xmath80 boson and opposing jet directions .",
    "this comparison reduces the sensitivity to global detector and underlying event biases that may be present in the vicinity of the @xmath80 boson and the jet .",
    "once the @xmath80 boson direction has been determined in the 0  detector , the opposing jet is identified by selecting the leading@xmath63 jet in the @xmath82 hemisphere opposite to the @xmath80 boson .",
    "annular regions are drawn around both the @xmath80 boson and the jet in @xmath83 space .",
    "the angular distributions of towers ( @xmath84 ) above the 250  mev threshold are measured in these annular regions using the polar variables @xmath66 and @xmath85 ; where @xmath86 and @xmath87 , in a search disk of @xmath88 .",
    "color coherence effects are expected to manifest themselves as an enhancement in the energetic tower distribution around the tagged jet in the event plane relative to the transverse plane ( when compared with the @xmath80 boson distribution ) .",
    "these coherence effects are similar to the string / drag effects observed in the @xmath11 events .",
    "0  has analyzed @xmath89 events requiring at least one jet with @xmath90  gev , @xmath91 , and @xmath80 boson rapidity @xmath92 .",
    "additionally , the @xmath93 component of the event vertex was restricted to @xmath94  cm to retain the projective nature of the calorimeter towers .",
    "the data angular distributions are compared to three mc samples , generated with different levels of color coherence effects , using the pythia 5.7 parton shower event generator and passed through a full detector simulation .",
    "pythia , with both ao and string fragmentation ( sf ) implemented , accounts for color coherence effects at both the perturbative and non - perturbative levels . turning off",
    "ao removes the perturbative contribution , and using independent fragmentation ( if ) eliminates the non - perturbative component .",
    "finally , a comparison to a mlla+lphd pqcd calculation of khoze and stirling@xcite is also presented .",
    "figure  [ cc_wjet]a shows the ratio of the tower multiplicity around the jet to the tower multiplicity around the @xmath80 as a function of @xmath73 .",
    "the number of towers is greater for the jet than for the @xmath80 boson and the excess is enhanced in the event plane ( @xmath95 ) and minimized in the transverse plane ( @xmath96 ) , consistent with the expectation from initial  to  final state color interference effects .",
    "the errors include only statistical uncertainties , which are significantly larger than all systematic uncertainties considered .",
    "a measure of the observed color coherence effect is obtained by calculating the jet/@xmath80 tower multiplicity enhancement of the event plane ( @xmath97 ) to the transverse plane ( @xmath98 ) , which would be expected to be unity in the absence of color coherence effects .",
    "this ratio of ratios is insensitive to the overall normalization of the individual distributions , and mc studies have shown that it is relatively insensitive to detector effects .",
    "figure  [ cc_wjet]b compares the data to the various pythia predictions and to the mlla+lphd calculation .",
    "there is good agreement with pythia with ao on and string fragmentation , and disagreement with ao off and string fragmentation or ao off and independent fragmentation .",
    "these comparisons imply that for the process under study , string fragmentation alone can not accommodate the effects seen in the data .",
    "the ao approximation is an element of parton - shower event generators that needs to be included if color coherence effects are to be modeled successfully",
    ". finally , the analytic predictions by khoze and stirling are in agreement with the data , giving additional evidence supporting the validity of the lphd hypothesis .",
    "most implementations of qcd coherence effects are based on a probabilistic scheme ( e.g. , ao approximation ) where interference terms of relative order @xmath15 are ignored ( the so - called large @xmath16 approximation ) . in this picture the way the partons are connected to form color singlet states is uniquely specified .",
    "for example , in @xmath99 events , in which two gluons are radiated against a @xmath100 pair from a @xmath41 decay , the quark is color - connected to one of the gluons , this gluon is connected to the second gluon , and the second gluon is connected to the antiquark .",
    "thus , the entire event consists of a color singlet state .    beyond the large @xmath16 approximation ,",
    "the color configurations that the partons follow when connected to each other is not longer specified uniquely . in our example , the possibility that the @xmath12 and @xmath101 form a color singlet by themselves , with the two gluons @xmath102 forming a separate color singlet , is suppressed by a factor of @xmath103 relative to the leading configuration described above . the possibility to connect the partons in this latter manner",
    "is often called color  reconnection \" or recoupling . color",
    " reconnection \" is , however , an unfortunate terminology since the partons have not been physically * re*-connected .",
    "color reconnection effects are of fundamental importance for our understanding of the confinement mechanism .",
    "does nature select a particular configuration at random or some configuration is dynamically favored in forming color singlet states ? recently there has been a lot of interest on color reconnection due to the possibility that higher order color rearrangement diagrams could affect the @xmath80 mass measurement at lep - ii .",
    "so far there has not been any experimental evidence on this expectation suggesting that these effects might be small in @xmath104 pair events@xcite .",
    "the opal collaboration has performed a search for color reconnection effects in @xmath105 events , in which the @xmath12 and @xmath101 are identified quark ( and antiquark ) jets which appear in the same hemisphere of an event .",
    "the object @xmath106 , taken to be the @xmath14 jet , is defined by all particles observed in the hemisphere opposite to that containing the @xmath12 and @xmath101 jets . in the limit that the @xmath12 and @xmath101 are collinear",
    "the gluon jets are produced from a color singlet point source , corresponding to the definition of gluon jets in the theoretical calculations .",
    "the ariadne mc program with and without reconnection effects is compared to the opal preliminary data .",
    "the version of ariadne with reconnection predicts fewer ( more ) particles at small ( large ) rapidities and energies than are observed in either the data or other standard mc programs .",
    "furthermore , ariadne with reconnection predicts a smaller charged particle multiplicity for the @xmath106 hemisphere than the other standard mc simulations or the multiplicity measured in data ( see fig .",
    "[ opal_reco ] ) .",
    "figure  [ opal_reco ] also shows the multiplicity distributions for light quark ( @xmath107 ) jets in @xmath108 decays , which appear to be insensitive to reconnection effects .",
    "opal performed two quantitative tests to assess the difference between the data and the predictions of ariadne .",
    "the first test is based on the comparison of the ratio of the mean gluon to light quark jet charged particle multiplicity between the data and the various mc predictions , and the second one is based on the probability for a @xmath106 jet to have five or fewer charged particles with @xmath109 .",
    "both tests showed that the ariadne reconnection model is disfavored by the data , whereas the standard qcd mc programs ( herwig , jetset , and ariadne without reconnection ) reproduce the experimental results well .",
    "the high precision data from hera , lep , sld , and tevatron have provided a detailed testing ground for the strong interactions .",
    "beautiful agreement of the data , from @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and  collisions , with analytic pqcd calculations , based on mlla and lphd , has been seen in several inclusive observables sensitive to color coherence phenomena .",
    "although the support of the lphd from the current data is strong , it is important to continue investigating the limitations of this picture , since it is not clear _ a priori _ for which observables and in which kinematic regions it applies .",
    "finally , the traditional parton shower event generators which incorporate color coherence effects at the perturbative and non - perturbative stages seem to describe well the interjet coherence phenomena observed in  collisions .",
