    "neutrino oscillation is widely accepted as a solution to the solar and atmospheric neutrino problems . however , in spite of the remarkable progress made in the studies of solar and atmospheric neutrinos , there are some ambiguities about neutrino mass spectrum and mixing . then neutrino emission from collapse - driven supernova attracts a significant attention because the supernova neutrinos can probe whole neutrino mass and their studies will help to identify the pattern of neutrino mass and mixing .",
    "@xcite in fact , the direct observations of neutrinos from sn1987a by the kamiokande @xcite and the imb detectors @xcite have provided rich information not only on the mechanism of supernova but also on the neutrino physics @xcite and paved the way for a new phase in the neutrino astrophysics .",
    "@xcite    the neutrinos , which are produced in the high dense region of the iron core , @xcite interact with matter before emerging from the supernova .",
    "the presence of non - zero masses and mixing in vacuum among various neutrino flavors results in strong matter dependent effects , including conversion from one flavor to another .",
    "hence , the observed neutrino flux in the detectors may be dramatically different for certain neutrino flavors and for certain values of mixing parameters , due to neutrino oscillation .",
    "@xcite    similar matter effects occur in the earth , too ( in connection with solar neutrino and sn1987a , see @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) . the neutrino trajectory inside the earth before reaching the detector",
    "depends on the direction of the supernova relative to the earth and the time of the day .",
    "the comparison of signals from different detectors would allow one to reveal the earth matter effects .",
    "also certain features of the energy spectra can reveal the earth matter effect even from the observations in one detector . in this paper",
    ", we study numerically the earth matter effects on supernova neutrino spectra with all three active neutrinos considered .",
    "we show that some ambiguities in the solar neutrino solutions and in @xmath0 can be resolved by the earth effect of supernova neutrino .",
    "we consider three - flavor mixing among active neutrinos .",
    "the three flavor eigenstates are related to the three mass eigenstates in vacuum through a unitary transformation , @xmath3 where @xmath4 are flavor eigenstates with flavor @xmath5 and @xmath6 are mass eigenstates with mass @xmath7 .",
    "a convenient parameterization for @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",
    "the quantities @xmath13 are the vacuum mixing angles . we have here put the cp phase equal to zero in the ckm matrix .",
    "experimental evidence suggests @xcite that both solar and atmospheric neutrinos display flavor oscillations , and hence that neutrinos have mass .",
    "all the existing experimental results on the atmospheric neutrinos can be well described in terms of the @xmath14 vacuum oscillation with mass squared difference and the mixing angle given by @xcite    @xmath15    in contrast , the current ( mean event rate ) solar neutrino data admit three types of msw solutions if the solar @xmath16 undergo two - neutrino transitions into active neutrinos , @xmath17 @xcite : the sma , the lma and the so - called `` low '' solution .",
    "we use sma and lma parameters as samples . @xmath18",
    "these ambiguities mentioned above can be resolved by supernova data including the earth effects .",
    "the calculations of the energy spectra of neutrinos performed in this paper are based on the time - evolution - operator method developed by ohlsson and snellman .",
    "@xcite this method provides the time evolution operator in terms of the mass squared differences and the vacuum mixing angle without introducing the auxiliary matter mixing angles .",
    "the evolution operator @xmath19 is a @xmath20 matrix whose components are functions of the length @xmath21 of the neutrino trajectory , the matter density parameter @xmath22 and the neutrino energy @xmath23 .",
    "the neutrino conversion probability amplitude is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the fermi constant , @xmath28 is the nucleon mass , and @xmath29 is the matter density .",
    "when the neutrinos travel through a series of matter densities with matter density parameters @xmath30 and thicknesses @xmath31 , the total evolution operator is simply given by @xmath32 we use the following values as the matter density parameter of the earth core and mantle , respectively ; @xmath33    when neutrinos from such a distance as in the case of supernova arrive at the earth , they are not coherent and interference between the different mass eigenstates does not occur @xcite .",
    "this effect can be included in our calculation by time - averaging the conversion probabilities at the surface of the earth .    in order to compute the neutrino energy spectra , we used energy spectra of neutrinos arriving at the surface of the earth ( fig.[fig:1 ] ) calculated by watanabe et al .",
    "@xcite they have been studying the future detection of a supernova neutrino burst taking the three - flavor neutrino oscillation inside the star into account .",
    "the system has two resonances : one at higher density ( h - resonance ) and the other at lower resonance ( l - resonance ) .",
    "adiabaticity at these resonances significantly influences on not only the neutrino flux outside the star but also the magnitude of the earth effects .",
    "we computed energy spectra of @xmath16 and @xmath34 for the following sets of mixing parameters , @xmath35 where @xmath36 ( normal hierarchy ) and @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "the value of @xmath0 determines the adiabaticity at the h resonance .",
    "@xcite the conversion is adiabatic and nonadiabatic for @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively . @xmath41 and @xmath42 correspond to the solutions to the solar neutrino problem lma and sma , respectively .    in terms of the classification by dighe and smirnov @xcite , the parameters ( a ) ,",
    "( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) correspond to i - lma , i - sma , iii - lma and iii - sma , respectively .",
    "they predict that the earth effect would be observed in spectra of @xmath34 of ( a ) , both @xmath16 and @xmath34 of ( c ) and @xmath16 of ( d ) . in our calculation , on the contrary , significant earth effects ( @xmath43 ) can be seen in three among @xmath44 spectra stated above : @xmath34 of ( a ) and both @xmath16 and @xmath34 of ( c ) , not @xmath16 of ( d ) .",
    "the flux reaching the detector from a supernova at a distance @xmath45 from the earth is reduced by an overall geometric factor of @xmath46 .",
    "we used @xmath47 kpc as the value of @xmath45 .",
    "we computed the flux of neutrinos at 130 discrete energies in a mantle - core - mantle step function model of the earth s matter density profile . for each neutrino flux with specific energy",
    ", we performed a sequence of energy averaging operations as follows .",
    "first we compute the @xmath48 conversion probabilities @xmath49 at @xmath50 mev intervals .",
    "then the flux at @xmath23 mev at the detector @xmath51 is , @xmath52,\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the @xmath54 flux just arriving at the earth .",
    "we take the energy width @xmath55 mev taking a rough energy resolutions of detectors into account .",
    "in fact , the energy resolutions of detectors depend on energy it self .",
    "but the rough estimation of energy resolution is sufficient , since our purpose is to see overall shapes of the spectra .",
    "we calculated energy spectra of neutrino which traveled through the mantle(@xmath56 km)-core(@xmath57 km ) -mantle(@xmath56 km ) , which correspond to zero nadir angle .",
    "significant earth effects were seen in the flux of @xmath58 with mixing parameter ( c ) and @xmath59 with mixing parameter ( a ) and ( c ) .",
    "then we converted the fluxes in which the earth effects can be seen to energy spectra at sno and superkamiokande . in calculating the energy spectra at sno ,",
    "two charged current interactions , @xmath60 are taken into account . for the cross sections for these reactions ,",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "the detection efficiency is taken to be one .",
    "fig.[fig:2 ] shows the time - integrated energy spectra of @xmath58,@xmath59 and @xmath61 at sno with mixing parameters ( c ) with and without the earth effects .    in calculating the energy spectra at superkamiokande",
    ", the reaction , @xmath62 which dominates the total event number , is taken into account .",
    "for the cross section of this reaction , we refer to @xcite .",
    "the appropriate detection efficiency curve is also taken into account @xcite .",
    "fig.[fig:3 ] shows the time - integrated energy spectra at superkamiokande with mixing parameters ( a ) and ( c ) with and without the earth effects .",
    "we do nt show the energy spectra at sno with mixing parameter ( a ) because the earth effects on @xmath58 and @xmath59 are negligible and small , respectively , and the number of event coming from @xmath58 is dominant . for mixing parameter ( b ) and ( d ) , no significant earth effect can be seen .",
    "the flux of the neutrino passing through the earth oscillates with respect to the energy .",
    "this behavior can be explained as follows . for simplicity",
    ", we assume the density of the earth be homogeneous .",
    "the dashed line in fig.[fig:4 ] shows the flux of @xmath16 which traveled @xmath63 km through the earth core .",
    "probability of neutrino conversion , for example , @xmath64 can be expressed as a function of the length the neutrino trajectory in matter and the neutrino energy , @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the matter oscillation length which can be written with the vacuum oscillation length @xmath67 , vacuum mixing angle @xmath68 , and the neutrino - electron interaction length @xmath69 as @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 is the electron number density .",
    "substituting , @xmath74 we obtain the argument of the second factor of @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "this function decreases from @xmath77 to @xmath78 as @xmath23 increases from @xmath79 mev to @xmath80 mev and takes an almost constant value @xmath78 for @xmath81 mev : the oscillation length asymptotically approaches a constant value .",
    "[ fig:5 ] )    on the other hand , the difference between the @xmath16 flux @xmath82 at the detector and the @xmath16 flux @xmath83 before traveling the earth is proportional to , @xcite @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the original fluxes of , respectively , @xmath16 and @xmath87 at the center of the supernova , which vanish at @xmath88 mev .",
    "@xcite fig.[fig:1 ] shows the original fluxes : the solid , dashed and dotted lines show @xmath85 , @xmath89and @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "the shapes of spectra can be understood roughly by the latter factor . at lower energy @xmath90 , then @xmath91 .",
    "@xmath92 at @xmath88 ev , then @xmath93 . at higher energy @xmath94 , then @xmath95 .",
    "the small oscillation can be understood as the oscillation of @xmath75 .",
    "fig.[fig:6 ] shows the @xmath16 flux inside the earth with parameters ( c ) which travel the mantle , core , and mantle .",
    "the length of the mantle and core are set to be @xmath56 km and @xmath57 km , respectively .",
    "if averaging operations are performed , flux oscillations damp because @xmath96 flux of different energies have different oscillation lengths and cancel the oscillation behavior while traveling long distance .",
    "since the oscillation lengths are comparable to the radius of the earth , the earth effects are strongly dependent on the neutrino path inside the earth .",
    "so the magnitude of the earth effects will be different at each detector .",
    "significant earth effects can be seen in the energy spectra at sno for mixing parameter ( c ) ( fig.[fig:2 ] ) .",
    "there are a large dip at 30 mev and a peak at 37 mev . binning appropriately , ( for example @xmath97 mev and @xmath98 mev , etc . ) we can tell whether the earth effects exist . since the energy value of dip and peak change if zenith angle of neutrino path changes , appropriate binning will change accordingly .",
    "the earth effects in fig.[fig:3 ] are very small .",
    "this smallness comes partly from the smallness of @xmath99 ( fig.[fig:1 ] ) .",
    "although the expected number of events at superkamiokande is very large ( @xmath100 counts)@xcite and then statistical error would be small , it would be difficult to detect the earth effect on neutrinos from supernova at 10kpc from the earth due to the uncertainties in supernova model . in this case",
    "we suggest as a criterion of the earth effect the ratio of events at lower energy ( @xmath101 mev ) to that at higher energy ( @xmath102 mev ) .",
    "these subjects need quantitative and statistical argument , which we plan to study in great detail elsewhere.@xcite    if we observe a supernova and detect neutrinos in future , whether the earth effects exist can help to determine the neutrino parameters .",
    "* when the earth effects are observed at both superkamiokande and sno , the neutrino parameter is ( c ) .",
    "* when the earth effects are observed at superkamiokande only , the neutrino parameter is ( a ) .",
    "recent result of solar neutrino analysis at superkamiokande favor lma rather than sma .",
    "@xcite if the solution of the solar neutrino problem would turn out to be lma , the earth effects on supernova neutrino can distinguish parameter ( a ) from ( c ) : we could determine @xmath103 , which is only loosely constrained by the other current experiment .",
    "k.takahashi would like to thank g.watanabe and s.nagataki for useful discussions .",
