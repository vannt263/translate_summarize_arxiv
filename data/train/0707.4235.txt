    "as the dimensions of solid state devices are scaled down , it is becoming increasingly necessary to improve the performance of the interconnects and their electrical characteristics .",
    "metal silicides have some advantages over pure metal contacts due to their low - electrical resistivity and good thermal stability and these silicides are extensively used in microelectronic devices as contact materials to the source / drain areas to control the schottky barrier height @xcite .",
    "energetic ion beams , when penetrate through the interface of different materials , produce massive atomic transport across the interface which results in many stable , unstable or even thermodynamically non - equilibrium phase formation around the interface . due to improved electrical and chemical properties of the ion irradiated materials , mixing of metal - metal or metal - semiconductor systems using ion beam is frequently used to tailor different suitable contact materials for electronic devices @xcite .",
    "ion bombardment induced composite formation in au - ni bilayer or multilayer films deposited on si @xcite or iii - v nitride semiconductors@xcite have been proved to be an effective method to fabricate contacts having low resistivity ( typically , @xmath2 6 @xmath3 10@xmath4 @xmath5-cm @xcite ) .",
    "rutherford backscattering ( rbs ) technique is an easy and efficient tool to study the dynamics and atomic rearrangement around the interface .",
    "analysis of rbs data and extraction of elemental depth profiles are mostly done using some standard codes @xcite which are based on matching of experimental spectra with the theoretically simulated spectra of hypothetical sample structures having multiple layers of different compositions .",
    "this type of indirect depth profiling is a difficult and time - consuming job sometimes leads to ambiguous results .",
    "even for rbs spectra showing well separated peaks of constituent elements , this type of indirect method to synthesize atomic depth profiles is not always a trivial issue specially when the number of layers in the hypothetical sample is large or when one investigates the accumulation / depletion of a particular element over a small region inside the sample .",
    "the aim of the present study is to implement a direct method to extract the depth profiles of the constituents from the rutherford backscattering spectra and to get insight of the interactions between thin co - sputtered au - ni film and si substrate during ion bombardment .",
    "the extracted concentration profiles of such a system and its analysis allows investigation of the mass transport of material across the interface during ar ion irradiation , which may be important in the field of interconnects and contacts in the electronic device fabrication .",
    "specially , relatively lower concentration of ni in the system introduces control over the interface dynamics and formation of au(ni)si alloy generated due to ion irradiation . in this study , we have shown the nature of impurity spreading into the matrix and subsequent broadening of interface due to 160 kev ar@xmath1 ion impact .",
    "thin metallic films of co - sputtered au and ni were grown on cleaned and polished si(100 ) substrates in ar atmosphere by dc magnetron sputtering . prior to the deposition",

    "ar introduction in the deposition chamber to create plasma necessary for sputtering the base pressure of the chamber was 8 @xmath3 10@xmath6 mbar .",
    "the deposition was carried out at room temperature and the pressure of the chamber during deposition was 9 @xmath3 10@xmath7 mbar . during deposition ,",
    "both the au and ni sources were operated simultaneously with same power to get uniformly mixed single layer of au and ni over the substrates . however , different sputtering rates of these elements gave rise to unequal stoichiometric composition within the films with 90 at% au and 10 at% ni .",
    "thickness of the deposited layer was @xmath2 30 nm as measured using x - ray reflectivity technique .",
    "the deposited samples were then irradiated with 160 kev @xmath0ar@xmath1 ions using high current ion implanter ( danfysik ) facility of saha institute of nuclear physics . a schematic diagram and details of the facility can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the fluences of the implanted ions were varied from 5 @xmath3 10@xmath8 to 5 @xmath3 10@xmath9 ions/@xmath10 and the pressure in the target chamber was 3 @xmath3 10@xmath6 mbar .",
    "homogeneous irradiation was achieved by means of a magnetic _ x - y _ beam scanning system .",
    "no special arrangement was made to control the temperature of the samples during implantation but the beam current was kept low to avoid beam heating induced atomic transport within the sample .",
    "depending on the attainable ion fluences , the ion beam fluxes were kept around 400 na/@xmath10 .",
    "the projected range of ar ions in the target was determined using srim2006 code .",
    "the irradiated samples were analyzed by means of rutherford backscattering spectrometry ( rbs ) using 2.05 mev he@xmath11 ions obtained from the pelletron of institute of physics , bhubaneswar .",
    "the backscattered data was collected using a silicon surface barrier detector with 16 kev resolution placed at 160@xmath12 .",
    "corresponding depth profiles were extracted from the rbs spectra by direct method described in the following section .",
    "the depth profiles of the constituent elements have been extracted directly from the backscattering data by a computer program written using matlab package .",
    "the method is particularly suitable for this system as the peaks corresponding to different elements are separated and well resolved .",
    "the direct determination of stoichiometry of the ion irradiation induced atomically mixed layer ensures accurate determination of elemental composition at various depths compared to other indirect simulation based standard codes .",
    "however , using both the above - mentioned procedures for a given analysis could be very convenient and helpful to avoid misinterpretation of the results .    under this data analysis scheme ,",
    "different elemental edges for the incident he@xmath11 ion energy @xmath13 , which is 2.05 mev in this case , are calculated and tracked in the experimental spectra using the relation @xmath14 , where @xmath15 s are the kinematic factors with @xmath16 representing the major elements present in the sample , namely , au , ni and si . the signal height ( @xmath17 ) of an element @xmath16 (= au , ni or si ) at its respective edge is given by @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the differential rutherford scattering cross sections of element @xmath16 at energy @xmath14 , @xmath20 is total amount of charge accumulated on the sample due to he@xmath11 incidence during the backscattering experiment , @xmath5 is the solid angle subtends by the solid - state detector at the sample and @xmath21 is the angle subtends by the incident he beam with the surface normal ( in the current setup @xmath21 * * * * = 0@xmath22 ) .",
    "@xmath23 is the atomic density of element @xmath16 in the mixture of au , ni and si at the surface and @xmath24 is the thickness of the imaginary surface layer inside the sample which is so chosen that the energies of he particles backscattered from this layer after colliding with atoms of element @xmath16 fall within the energy window @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the energy width of one channel of the detector .",
    "it is evident from the above fact that the depths @xmath27 for different constituents will be different depending on the concentration of a particular element in that mixture , respective kinematic factor and scattering cross section .",
    "the atomic density of the mixture @xmath28 is given by the relation @xmath29 where @xmath30 s are the atomic densities of elements indicated by the subscripts and _ m _ , _ n _ and _ p _ are relative fractions of au , ni and si respectively .",

    "can be treated as unity in the first approximation and using the tabulated values of @xmath40s@xcite , relative concentration of each element has been estimated .",
    "as the concentrations of all the elements within the depth @xmath27 can be calculated using the above approximation , the values of @xmath39_{au}^{mix}/\\left[\\varepsilon(e_{0})\\right]_{ni}^{mix}$ ] and @xmath39_{au}^{mix}/\\left[\\varepsilon(e_{0})\\right]_{si}^{mix}$ ] can be extracted using the expression of stopping cross section factor of element @xmath16 : @xmath41_{x}^{mix}=\\left[\\frac{k_{x}}{\\cos\\theta}\\varepsilon^{mix}(e_{0})+\\frac{1}{\\cos\\phi}\\varepsilon^{mix}(k_{x}e_{0})\\right]\\label{eq : epsilon_mix_x}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 (= @xmath43 , in this experimental setup ) is the complement of scattering angle and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the stopping cross sections of the mixture at energies @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "the expressions of stopping cross section of the mixture for any given energy @xmath46 is represented by @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are individual stopping cross sections of au , ni and si respectively which are evaluated by the polynomial fit expressions @xcite @xmath51 with @xmath52 being constants for a particular element when @xmath46 is expressed in mev .",
    "using equations ( [ eq : epsilon_mix_x ] ) and ( [ eq : epsilon_mix ] ) , the stopping cross section factors for different elements are calculated and fed in equations ( [ eq : m / n ] ) and ( [ eq : m / p ] ) to calculate exact values of atomic fractions which values are again used in equations ( [ eq : epsilon_mix_x ] ) and ( [ eq : epsilon_mix ] ) in iterative manner to produce more accurate values of elemental concentrations in the layer .",
    "as the thickness @xmath53 and composition @xmath54 of the first layer is known , the energy , loses by the penetrating he ion while traveling through that layer can also be estimated and the energy of the ion just before entering the next layer @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 represents the energy of the ion at the point of entering into the previous layer (= @xmath13 , when dealing with second layer starting from surface ) . simultaneously , signal heights of each element in the next lower channels starting from the corresponding elemental edges are also extracted .",
    "the ratios of atomic fractions in the second layer are given by @xmath58_{au}^{mix}}{\\left[\\varepsilon(e)\\right]_{ni}^{mix}}\\frac{\\varepsilon(e_{ni } ) } { \\varepsilon(e_{au})}\\frac{\\varepsilon(k_{ni}e)}{\\varepsilon(k_{au}e)}\\right\\ } \\label{eq : m / n depth}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath59_{au}^{mix}}{\\left[\\varepsilon(e)\\right]_{si}^{mix}}\\frac{\\varepsilon(e_{si } ) } { \\varepsilon(e_{au})}\\frac{\\varepsilon(k_{si}e)}{\\varepsilon(k_{au}e)}\\right\\ } \\label{eq : m / p depth}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the height of au signal in the channel preceding to that which corresponds to au edge and @xmath61 is the energy equivalent of that particular channel . similarly , @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the heights for ni and si signals respectively at channels next to ni and si edges towards the lower energy side . @xmath64 and @xmath65 _ etc . _ are stopping cross sections at energies @xmath61 and @xmath66 and so on .",
    "@xmath67_{x}^{mix}$ ] is the stopping cross section factor for element @xmath16 present in the mixture and expressed by the same relation as equation ( [ eq : epsilon_mix_x ] ) with energy @xmath13 replaced by @xmath46 .",
    "when treating the second layer , the approximation applied to the surface layer for determining the elemental composition is also valid which treats the values of the quantities within curly braces in equations ( [ eq : m / n depth ] ) and ( [ eq : m / p depth ] ) as unity .",
    "so , first estimation of the concentrations can be figured out using that approximation which , in turn , can be used along with equation ( [ eq : epsilon ] ) and tabulated values of @xmath40s@xcite in iterative manner to determine accurate values of elemental concentrations in that layer .",
    "subsequent determination of @xmath28 and @xmath27 for the layer can be done using equations ( [ eq : n_mix ] ) , ( [ eq : elemental tau ] ) and ( [ eq : tau ] ) . for estimating elemental concentrations of third , forth and subsequent deeper layers , same formalism and expressions as applied to second layer can be followed .",
    "it should be noted that experimentally obtained rbs spectra are convoluted with the apparatus function which contains initial beam energy dispersion , energy resolution of the detector , energy loss and energy - loss straggling in the detector as well as in the sample .",
    "but the determination of deconvoluted spectra using the normal deconvolution process is not trivial and sometimes introduces unwanted undulations in the spectra which may yield negative concentration of an element at some depth .",
    "so some other approaches described in ref.@xcite or bayesian probability theory @xcite are suitable for recovering the true spectra .",
    "since the final aim of this paper is to investigate the relative broadening of au and si profiles with increased ion fluence in case of co - sputtered au - ni system , the effect of apparatus function causes unidirectional change in the rbs spectra and hence nullified .",
    "figure 1 represents rutherford backscattering spectra of as deposited and samples irradiated with ar ions at different fluences .",
    "it can be observed from the figure that the au signal height decreases with increasing dose which signifies sputter erosion of the films . on the other hand , ni signals do not decrease significantly with increasing dose .",
    "this is due to the fact that higher sputtering yield of gold triggers preferential sputtering of au atoms within the mixture of au and ni . as a result ,",
    "ni signal heights decrease less rapidly than that of au . along with diminution of au and ni peaks , tailing of these signals towards lower energy side can also be observed representing ion irradiation induced atomic diffusion of constitutes in the direction of sample interior .",
    "the accumulation of ar atoms which penetrate into the samples during ion irradiation , show no considerable change in the spectra until a dose of 1 @xmath3 10@xmath9 ions/@xmath10 beyond which a strong peak of ar emerged between ni and si peaks .",
    "in contrast to the spreading of au and ni signals towards si side , ar peak at a fluence of 5 @xmath3 10@xmath9 ions/@xmath10 shows symmetry around its maximum position implying gaussian type distribution commonly observed in case of implanted ions in solids at relatively low doses .",
    "variation of total counts enveloped by the au signals in the rbs spectra with ion dose have been showed in figure 2 .",
    "the total count for as deposited sample has been taken as unity and other counts are normalized with respect to that .",
    "the counts decrease rapidly at the initial stage of ion irradiation and after achieving a dose of 1 @xmath3 10@xmath9 ions/@xmath10 it becomes monotonous which is in accordance with the previously reported result regarding sputter erosion of thin films@xcite .",
    "the data has been fitted using exponential decay function@xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the normalized and saturated counts respectively and @xmath71 , @xmath72 are constants .",
    "the fit gives the values of different parameters as @xmath73 0.62 @xmath74 0.03 , @xmath75 0.36 @xmath74 0.04 and @xmath76 ( 27.98 @xmath74 11.09 ) @xmath3 10@xmath8 ions/@xmath10 .",
    "the exponential decay of the au counts with ion dose suggests that sputtering of thin films is different from that of bulk material . at the early phase of ion bombardment the sputtering is to some extent analogous to bulk sputtering and the sputtering yields of au and ni for an ion - target combination as the present one are @xmath2 4.0 and @xmath2 0.5 atoms / ion respectively , as calculated using srim code . the outcome of larger yield for au is a ni - rich top layer along with surfacing of si due to ion induced cascade mixing of the components which produces a saturated region in figure 2[fig : au counts ] above a critical dose of 1 @xmath3 10@xmath9 ions/@xmath10 .",
    "the depth profiles of as deposited and irradiated samples as shown in figure 3 reveal the possible cause of exponential type decaying of integrated au counts represented in figure 2 .",
    "the depth profiles of as deposited and sample irradiated at a dose of 5 @xmath3 10@xmath8 ions/@xmath10 show no significant difference with a presence of @xmath2 90% au and @xmath2 10% ni at the surface . after achieving a fluence of 1 @xmath3 10@xmath77 ions/@xmath10 ,",
    "the sputter erosion of top surface layer is visible in the au profile which is more noticeable at the next dose by the advancement of si profile towards the surface .",
    "the si concentration at the surface has reached around 15% for ion dose of 5 @xmath3 10@xmath77 ions/@xmath10 , with a reduction of the amount of au . at higher doses",
    "the effect of preceding of si profile is more dominant .",
    "moreover , at a fluence of 1 @xmath3 10@xmath9 ions/@xmath10 , a surface layer of 10 nm having an approximate composition of au@xmath78ni@xmath79si@xmath80 covering another layer of au@xmath81ni@xmath79si@xmath82 which spreads over @xmath2 20 nm has emerged . at the next higher ion dose , _",
    "i.e_. at 5 @xmath3 10@xmath9 ions/@xmath10 , the buried compound layer has been exposed leaving completely mixed surface layer having a thickness of @xmath2 20 nm .",
    "the formation of mixed layers at the surface and subsurface regions at higher irradiation doses are responsible for saturation of au signal count represented in figure 2 . however , the ni profiles at various fluences show very little observable changes due to irradiation .    the extracted atomic profiles has been used to quantify the growth of the mixed region due to ion irradiation .",
    "au and si profiles are fitted with error function to deduce the change in variance @xmath83 as a function of ion dose .",
    "the relative change in variances ( @xmath84 ) for various doses with respect to the variance of au profile for as deposited sample is represented in figure 4 .",
    "a linear growth of the variance with the ion fluence had been observed previously in many metal / semiconductor systems due to ion irradiation@xcite .",
    "but for the present system , the linear variation of @xmath84 with ion dose seems to be valid only up to a fluence of 1 @xmath3 10@xmath9 ions/@xmath10 . beyond that @xmath84 for both au and si profiles",
    "decrease to a lower value .",
    "the linear fit of present data up to 1 @xmath3 10@xmath9 ions/@xmath10 give the mixing rates @xmath85 = 6.88 @xmath74 0.77 nm@xmath86 for au and 9.34 @xmath74 0.43 nm@xmath86 for si .",
    "the difference in mixing rates is probably due to the diffusion of ni atoms in si layer which occurs simultaneously with au",
    ". the lower heat of compound formation ( 16 kj / g at . ) for ni and si and hence ready creation of different ni - si phases forms a physical barrier before the au atoms to spread at an equal rate of si .",
    "the decrease in @xmath84 beyond 1 @xmath3 10@xmath9 ions/@xmath10 can be explained with the help of figure 2 and 3 .",
    "the srim simulated range of impinging ar ions is @xmath2 125 @xmath74 65 nm which is sufficient to deposit considerable energy on both sides of the interface and produces collision cascades .",
    "collision cascades both in film and substrate regions set off recoil implantation , cascade mixing and radiation enhanced diffusion processes .",
    "simultaneous preferential surface sputtering and cascade mixing not only form a au - depleted surface but also an accumulation of si around the near - surface region at and beyond 1 @xmath3 10@xmath9 ions/@xmath10 ar dose ( figures 3(e ) and 3(f ) ) .",
    "eventually , the evolution of homogeneously mixed layer of au@xmath81ni@xmath79si@xmath82 which has been already discussed , contributes towards the sputtering process .",
    "the notable fact about these mixed layers is the absence of preferential sputtering of any species due to ion impact .",
    "the major components of the mixture , namely au and si are sputtered at the same rates which is supported by the srim simulation of similar kind of target composition - ion combination .",
    "the simulation provides the erosion yields of both au and si as @xmath2 1.5 atoms / ion and as a result , not any single component but the whole surface is sputtered away with ion impact .",
    "this fact is further supported by figure 2 which shows a flat region past a threshold dose .",
    "thus , the bulk si is becoming exposed which gives rise to lower values of @xmath84 at an ion fluence of 5 @xmath3 10@xmath9 ions/@xmath10 .",
    "in this study , an efficient analytical method to analyze rbs data has been presented . using that method ,",
    "depth profiles of different components of co - sputtered and ion irradiated au - ni thin films on si has been investigated .",
    "it has been observed that variation of @xmath84 with dose follows a linear relationship up to a certain ion fluence which yields mixing rates of 6.88 @xmath74 0.77 and 9.34 @xmath74 0.43 nm@xmath86 for au and si , respectively .",
    "the lowering of @xmath84 values ahead of a critical dose can be explained by the formation of au - ni - si composite at the surface from which elements are sputtered out evenly which is further supported by variation of au counts in rbs spectra with ion dose .",
