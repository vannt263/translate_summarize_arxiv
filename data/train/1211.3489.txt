    "we presently interpret the c - n , o - na and mg - al abundance anticorrelations in globular cluster ( gc ) stars as a result of two - generation star formation and stellar - mode ( i.e. , supernova - free ) chemical feedback ( e.g. , carretta et al .",
    "2010 ; dercole et al .",
    "2008 ) . the present - day ratio of second- to first - generation stars in gcs is roughly 1:1 , which leads to what is known as the `` mass budget problem '' : there is simply not enough mass in stellar winds from the first generation to produce an equally massive second generation .",
    "proposed solutions have included a top - heavy imf for the first generation ( decressin et al .",
    "2007 ) and a truncated mass function for the second generation ( dercole et al . 2008 ) , but currently favored models require that the first generation was originally more massive ( by a factor of 10 - 20 ) than it currently is .",
    "these massive gc formation models then require that the excess first - generation stars be preferentially removed from the cluster to reduce the ratio of second- to first - generation stars to its present - day level .",
    "there are gcs that are currently losing stars to the halo field through extended tidal tails ( e.g. , palomar 5 , odenkirchen et al .",
    "2003 ; ngc 5466 , belokurov et al .",
    "2006 ) , and there is a theoretical expectation that many more gcs should have dissolved at earlier times as a result of tidal interactions with the galaxy , internal 2-body interactions , and stellar evolution ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) . if these globular clusters contained second - generation stars at the point of dissolution , then some fraction of halo field stars should carry the second - generation light - element abundance pattern .",
    "to look for halo field stars with second - generation abundances , martell & grebel ( 2010 ) and martell et al .",
    "( 2011 ) searched the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) segue and segue-2 low - resolution spectroscopic databases , respectively .",
    "selecting red giants with @xmath0 [ fe / h ] @xmath1 , reasonably well - determined stellar parameters and clean spectra , they identified a total of 2519 halo giants , 65 of which ( @xmath2 ) appear to have second - generation carbon and nitrogen abudances . for these stars ,",
    "the @xmath3 cn band is strong and the @xmath4 ch g - band is weak , relative to other field stars at similar metallicity and evolutionary phase .    ongoing work ( carollo et al . , in prep . )",
    "is finding that these cn - strong field giants , presumably second - generation globular cluster stars that have been lost to the halo , have orbits and kinematics consistent with the inner halo population ( carollo et al . 2007 ; 2010 ) .",
    "in that work , we are also finding that globular clusters with proper motion measurements available in the literature have orbits and kinematics similar to the inner halo population , making them a reasonable potential source for _ in situ _ formation of the inner halo .",
    "the fraction of stars in the galactic halo with light - element abundances similar to second - generation globular cluster stars is small , roughly @xmath5 , but high - mass models for globular cluster formation require that they should be accompanied by several times as many first - generation stars , chemically indistinguishable from halo stars that formed outside gcs .",
    "this implies that globular clusters , as a major site of star formation 12 gyr ago , are a significant contributor to galactic halo assembly .",
