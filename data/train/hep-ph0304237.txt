    "b physics studies are exploiting a unique laboratory for testing the standard model in the fermion sector , for studying the qcd in the non - perturbative regime and for searching for new physics through virtual processes .",

    "the @xmath10 hadrons were known and their properties were under study .",
    "new weakly decaying b hadrons have been observed ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) for the first time and their production and decay properties have been measured .",
    "new strongly decaying hadrons , the orbitally ( l=1 ) excited b ( @xmath4 ) mesons have been also observed and their mass and production rates measured .",
    "+ in this paper we will focus on the measurements of the ckm matrix elements  : @xmath11 and @xmath12 through b decays and @xmath13 and @xmath14 using @xmath15 oscillations . on the other hand many additional measurements on b meson properties ( mass , branching fractions , lifetimes ... ) are necessary to constrain the heavy quark theories ( operator product expansion ( ope ) /heavy",
    "quark effective theory ( hqet ) /lattice qcd ( lqcd ) ) to allow for precise extraction of the ckm parameters .",
    "we finally show how these measurements constrain the standard model in the fermion sector , through the determination of the unitarity triangle parameters .",
    "+ in this paper we try to compare the lep / sld results with those obtained from other collaborations ( cleo at cornell , cdf at tevatron and the asymmetric b - factories : babar and belle ) and to present , when available , the world average result .",
    "a detailed description of the results and of the averaging techniques can be found in @xcite .",
    "at the @xmath16 resonance , b hadrons are produced from the coupling of the @xmath16 to a @xmath17 quark pair .",
    "the production cross section is of @xmath18 6 nb , which is five times larger than at the @xmath19 . because of the specific ( v - a ) behaviour of the electroweak coupling at the @xmath16 pole , hadronic events account for about 70@xmath20 of the total production rate ; among these , the fraction of @xmath21 events is @xmath22 . because of the energy available only @xmath10 and @xmath23 mesons can be produced at the @xmath19 .",
    "the b particles are produced almost at rest ( the average momentum is of about 350 mev / c ) , with no accompanying additional hadrons , and the decay products of the two b particles are spread isotropically over the space . at the z pole , the primary @xmath17 pair , picks up from the vacuum other quark - antiquarks pairs and hadronizes into b hadrons plus few other particles .",
    "therefore not only @xmath24 and @xmath9 mesons are produced , but also @xmath25 mesons or @xmath26 baryons can be present in the final state .",
    "the @xmath0 and the @xmath27 hadronize almost independently .",
    "@xmath0 quarks fragment differently from light quarks , because of their high mass as compared with @xmath28 .",
    "b hadrons carry , on average , about 70@xmath20 of the available beam energy , whereas the rest of the energy is distributed among the other fragmenting particles . as a consequence ,",
    "the two b hadrons fly in opposite directions and their decay products form jets situated in two opposite hemispheres .",
    "+ the hard fragmentation and the long lifetime of the b quark make that the flight distance of a b hadron at the z pole , defined as @xmath29 , on average of the order of 3 mm . as decay products have a mean charged multiplicity of 5,-quark fragmentation and from b decay . ]",
    "it was possible to tag b hadrons using a lifetime tag .",
    "most of the precision measurements in b physics performed at lep / slc , tevatron and b factories , would not have been possible without the development of silicon micro vertex detectors . in practice",
    "the averaged flight distance of the b hadrons becomes measurable thanks to the precision of silicon detectors , located as close as possible to the beam interaction point .",
    "these detectors determine with a precision better than 10 @xmath30 , the position of a charged particle trajectory .",
    "in particular the separation between @xmath0 quarks and other quarks is mainly based on the use of vertex detectors .",
    "charged particles produced at the b vertex ( secondary vertex ) can be separated from those produced at the interaction point ( primary vertex ) using the precise tracking information . in spite of the relatively small statistics collected by the sld experiment , it gave very important and competitive contributions to b physics , because of its silicon vertex detectors , which is located very close to the interaction point .",

    "+ semileptonic decays benefit of a large branching ratio ( of the order of 10@xmath20 ) and of clean and easily distinguishable final states .",

    "<S> in the last decade , the lep and sld experiments played a central role in the study of b hadrons ( hadrons containing a @xmath0 quark ) . </S>",
    "<S> new b hadrons have been observed ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) and their production and decay properties have been measured . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we will focus on measurements of the ckm matrix elements  : @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we will show how all these measurements , together with theoretical developments , have significantly improved our knowledge on the flavour sector of the standard model . </S>"
