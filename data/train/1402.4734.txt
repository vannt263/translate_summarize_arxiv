    "it is observed from experience , that the phenomenon of fluid flow through porous media is not uniform in every direction , on the contrary , preferential paths are developed .",
    "the problem of preferential flow has been extensively studied in recent years from several points of view and at different scales of modeling , due to its remarkable importance in different fields such as oil extraction , water supply , pollution of subsurface streams and soils , waste management , etc . at the pore scale ,",
    "the presence of solutes and colloids , chemical reactions , high viscosity of the fluid and saturation level have been included in different theoretical and/or empirical models ; see @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , upscaling this effects to that of the geological medium , or _ field scale _ , has proved to be an extremely difficult task .",
    "a different approach emphasizes on the multiple scale aspects of the problem , when preferential flow occurs because of the presence of large pores ( connected or not ) or geological strata ; which generates regions of fast and slow flow exchanging fluid .",
    "hence , several models of coupled systems of partial differential equations have been proposed , such as dual @xcite and multiple porosity models @xcite , microstructure models @xcite and the coupling of laws at different scale : see @xcite for an analytic approach of a darcy - stokes system and see @xcite for a numerical treatment to a darcy - brinkman system . on a different line",
    "there are several works , numerical @xcite or numerical / analytical @xcite , dealing with the discretization and numerical aspects as well as the assessment and simulation of the proposed models .",
    "yet another approach lies on a probabilistic point of view @xcite based on principles of conductivity . in this work we focus on the impact that the _ geometry _ of the cracks in a fissured medium has on this phenomenon .",
    "[ fig geological fissured medium ]        [ fig average velocity on fissure portion ]       [ fig fissured system ] fissured media are common geological structures , here the fast flow occurs on the cracks while the rock matrix constitutes the slow flow region . for small values of the reynolds number it is intuitive to see that the saturated flow on the fissures is predominantly parallel to the surface hosting it , see figure [ fig fissured system ] ( a )",
    "this fact has been shown in several rigorous mathematical works , see @xcite for homogenization techniques and @xcite for asymptotic analysis . in the present work",
    "we exploit this fact to compute the `` average direction '' of tangential velocity fields hosted on a surface to predict the _ likely preferential flow directions _ of the system . in figure [ fig fissured system ] ( b )",
    "a region of the fissured system is isolated in a way that contains only one crack . assuming the flow is isotropic on the rock matrix",
    ", it follows that the preferential flow direction in this region strictly depends on the flow field hosted on the surface , i.e. its `` average '' behavior . in this work",
    "we assume the medium has one single fissure @xmath0 and state that its preferential flow is the  average \" tangential flow hosted on the surface @xmath0 of the crack . towards the end of the exposition ( section [ closing remarks ] ) , it will be clear how to extend the method to a system with multiple fissures .    describing the exact flow field on the fissures on one hand , has a complexity level essentially equivalent to solving the problem of preferential direction itself , on the other hand for computational purposes it is always necessary to discretize the surface together with the flow fields .",
    "consequently we choose a different approach : first we assume the medium has one single car we construct idealized flow fields related to finite triangulations of a surface , defined only by certain aspects of the geometry of the surface .",
    "such fields are not realistic for describing the flow configuration on the manifold , however they are useful to compare quantities of mechanical energy dissipation . hence , in order to find the preferential flow directions amongst all the possible aforementioned flow fields , we apply the reasoning line of the arquimedian weight comparison method .",
    "as it turns out , in most of the cases the preferential flow direction is not unique , and a probabilist treatment must be adopted .",
    "next , we introduce the notation , vectors in @xmath1 and @xmath2 will be denoted with bold characters and @xmath3 stands for the euclidean norm . if @xmath4 we denote @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "the notation @xmath7 indicates computation of average according to the context .",
    "the unitary circle in @xmath1 is denoted by @xmath8 and the unitary sphere in @xmath9 is denoted by @xmath10 . for a given set @xmath11",
    "we denote @xmath12 its 2-d or 1-d lebesgue measure in both cases , since it will be clear from the context and @xmath13 stands for its cardinal .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sections 2 , 3 and 4 the preferential flow phenomenon is analyzed from the perspectives of curvature , gravity and friction respectively .",
    "all of them are based on comparing mechanical energy dissipation , therefore each section begins constructing adequate flow fields to quantify these losses .",
    "next , the exposition moves to a rigorous discussion of mathematical aspects of the model ; most of them necessary for a successful construction of the _ preferential flow directions probability space_. section 5 shows how to assemble the effects previously analyzed and defines the entropy of the preferential flow information ; then closes with final remarks and future work . in the reminder of this section we present the geometric setting and the minimum necessary background from fluid mechanics .",
    "this work will be restricted to the treatment of surfaces @xmath0 coming from a piecewise @xmath14-function @xmath15 defined on an open bounded simply connected set @xmath16 of @xmath1 .",
    "in particular the piecewise @xmath14 2-d manifold @xmath0 has an atlas containing one element .",
    "the approximation of surfaces will be done by piecewise linear affine triangulations . however , the triangulation has to meet certain geometric conditions in order to be suitable for later quantifications of mechanical energy losses .",
    "those conditions are consistent with the concept of _ admissible mesh _ in the sense of @xcite ( definition 9.1 page 762 ) ; we have    [ def admissible mesh ] let @xmath17 be an open bounded polygonal subset of @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",

    "in particular , the condition on the interior angles assures that the orthogonal bisectors intersect inside each triangle , thus naturally defining the points @xmath54 .",
