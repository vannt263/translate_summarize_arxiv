    "as a bright , nearby seyfert  1 galaxy [ z = 0.00976 , @xcite ] , ngc  3783  is one of the best studied active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . in the x - rays , observations with _ rosat _",
    "@xcite and _ asca_@xcite revealed a highly - ionized absorber , but lacked the spectral resolution required for kinematic measurements .",
    "lately , the rich absorption line spectrum of ngc  3783  has been readily measured with the grating spectrometers on board the x - rayobservatories _ chandra _",
    "@xcite and _ xmm - newton _",
    "@xcite , telling us that the highly - ionized gas is outflowing at velocities of a few 100 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "these spectra of ngc  3783  feature numerous absorption lines by k - shell ions of c , n , o , ne , mg , si , and s , as well as by l - shell ions of fe . many inner - shell absorption lines formed by lower ionization states are also found in ngc  3783  @xcite indicating a broad range of ionization .",
    "@xcite used the high resolving power ( @xmath5 up to 1000 ) of the _ chandra _  high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs which covers the 1.6  - 23.4  wavelength range ) to determine the mean outflow velocity of @xmath6590 @xmath7 150 km  s@xmath4  and a mean fwhm  of 820 @xmath7 280 km  s@xmath4  for the absorber in ngc  3783 .",
    "the unprecedented small errors are due to an integrated observing time of 900  ks .",
    "both velocities are consistent with a blend of known uv  absorption systems . @xcite employed a short 40  ks observation of ngc  3783  with the reflection grating spectrometers ( rgs , @xmath8 up to 400 ) on board _ xmm - newton _  to construct a plasma model with two ionization phases in the x - ray  absorber that reproduced the rgsspectrum between 6 and 38   quite well . however , as was also pointed out by @xcite , the wide range of observed charge states is indicative of a broad distribution of ionization within each phase . despite the extensive x - ray  measurements ,",
    "the location , form , and energetic significance of the outflow in ngc  3783  have remained much of a mystery .",
    "the connection of the x - ray  absorber to agn  constituents observed in other wavebands is a long standing puzzle .",
    "the broad - line region ( blr ) in ngc  3783  is inferred from the optical time lag measurements of @xcite to cover a range of distances from approximately 10@xmath9 to 10@xmath10  cm ( not along the line of sight ) . combining x - ray  and uv  observations , @xcite",
    "favor the interpretation by which the uv  and x - ray  absorbers constitute a single medium .",
    "their analysis implies an upper limit of about 30  pc for the separation between the nucleus and the absorbing plasma .",
    "recently , four velocity components have been resolved by @xcite in the uv  absorption spectrum of ngc  3783 . interpreting absorption of at 1175    as arising from a metastable level ,",
    "@xcite estimate the electron density in the high - velocity component to be @xmath11 10@xmath2 @xmath3  and , hence , the absorber to be located at a distance @xmath12 8  @xmath13  10@xmath14  cm away from the central source and with a typical size of @xmath15 10@xmath16  cm , i.e. , numerous highly - clumped cloudlets .",
    "conversely , a narrow line component with a centroid velocity of 0  km  s@xmath4  was estimated by @xcite to originate about 40  pc away from the nucleus .    in december 2001 , _ xmm - newton _  observed ngc  3783  for 280  ks .",
    "the high effective area of the rgs  makes this data set comparable in statistical quality to that obtained in 900  ks with the hetgs  in the respective wavebands . in this paper , we present the rgsspectrum from this long observation .",
    "the main goal is to further characterize the x - ray  absorbing and emitting gas and particularly to constrain its geometry and physical conditions .",
    "ngc  3783  was observed by _ xmm - newton _  for a total of 280  ks from december 17 - 21 as part of the rgs  guaranteed time program .",
    "the data obtained with the epic  x - ray  cameras and with the optical monitor ( om ) will be discussed elsewhere ( blustin et al . , in preparation ) . here",
    "we focus on the rgs  spectrum .",
    "the rgs  data were processed using custom software developed at columbia university , which operates on the observation data files ( odf ) .",
    "this software is similar in origin and in function to the rgsbranch of the science analysis system ( sas ) , but is more flexible and includes recent calibration of the instrumental o - edge region based on accumulated data from long observations of mrk  421 @xcite .",
    "it corrects for the effect of aspect drift on the dispersion angles and includes background subtraction using off - target ccd  regions .      the rgs  light curves are shown in fig .",
    "it is evident that the soft x - ray  flux varies fitfully and by as much as a factor of 2 on time scales of hours .",
    "the light curves obtained with the epic cameras , which are more sensitive to hard x - rays , show very similar behavior .",
    "the uv  light curve obtained with the optical monitor ( om ) resembles the curve in fig .  1 , only it is somewhat smoother ( blustin et  al .",
    ", in preparation )",
    ". observed variations in the ionization state of the absorber due to changes in the continuum flux could potentially shed light on the location of the absorber through ionization and recombination times . with that goal in mind",
    ", we divide the 280  ks observation into four temporal segments , seeking variations in the absorption spectrum .",
    "the four segments are labeled in fig .  1 as the `` low '' , `` rise '' , `` high '' , and `` peak '' phases .",
    "the spectra obtained for each segment separately are presented in fig .  2 .",
    "each segment by itself suffers from limited statistics .",
    "consequently , disparities in narrow features such as emission or absorption lines , which have limited counts in a few bins , are very difficult to detect unambiguously . on the other hand",
    ", it is clearly seen that the broad absorption features in the spectrum , such as the fe m - shell 2p  - 3d unresolved transition array ( uta ) between 16 and 17   and the and photoelectric bound - free k - edges ( just noticeable at 14.2  & 16.8   ) do not vary significantly from one time segment to the other . indeed , calculated ratios of spectra among the various time segments show mostly noise around the flat ratio of the continua to within the data errors , i.e. , @xmath1710% .",
    "for example , the ratio of the `` high '' and `` low '' segments is plotted in fig .",
    "the plot is rather noisy , but no clear bound - free edge features are observed .",
    "the only statistically significant deviations from the mean in fig .  3 are well localized around strong emission / absorption lines ( e.g. , at 13.48   ) . since emission lines are not expected to disappear in the ratio plot and since ratios at deep absorption troughs are unreliable , we interpret the lack of bound - free features as evidence for no detectable variation in absorption .",
    "the position and shape of the fe - m 2p-3d uta  are expected to be particularly sensitive to the ionizing flux as several m - shell charge states of the same element are observed at the same time . during the present observation , the ionizing flux overall increased gradually by almost a factor of 2 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "an average increase of about 50% occurs from the `` low '' state to the `` high '' state .",
    "such an increase in the ionization parameter @xmath18 [ @xmath18  = @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the ionizing luminosity ] would have shifted the uta  towards shorter wavelengths by about 0.4   , if the gas had reached a new equilibrium state .",
    "such a shift would have been surely detectable with the rgs . carefully examining fig .",
    "3 , it is possible to visualize a slight , statistically insignificant , shift in the uta  around 16   .",
    "however , this is exactly where the ly@xmath21 line falls and in any event the effect is smaller than would be expected from new equilibrium conditions . together with the lack of edge features in fig .  3 ,",
    "this makes for strong evidence that the ionization state in the absorber does not have ample time to reach a new equilibrium state and , thus , it is hardly affected by the rapidly varying continuum .",
    "since the ionization time depends directly on the absolute ionizing flux seen by the absorber ( i.e. , its distance from the source ) , we can use the lack of ionization despite the increase in flux to place a lower bound to the separation between the source and the absorber . for a detailed discussion of ionization in winds , see @xcite .",
    "we take the average power - law ionizing flux density @xmath22 with @xmath23 = 1  kev and @xmath24 1.7 .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath25 scales with @xmath26 and reaches its observed value of about 0.015 photons  s@xmath4  @xmath27  kev@xmath4 at the telescope at a distance of 41.8  mpc ( assuming @xmath28  = 70 km  s@xmath4  mpc@xmath4 ) . to first order and as an upper limit , the equilibration time is the reciprocal of the photoionization ( pi ) rate @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the pi cross section . for , we get a time of 4.6  @xmath31}^2 $ ] days , where @xmath31}$ ] is the distance of the absorber from the source in parsecs .",
    "the unnoticeable change in ionization observed over more than a day following the rise of the continuum implies that the absorber is at least 0.46  pc away from the source . extrapolating the power law continuum down to the ionization energy of ( @xmath32  0.23  kev ) , which is dominant in the fe - m uta ( at about 16.6   ) , but also representative of the other m - shell ions , we get an even shorter ionization time of about 0.13  @xmath31}^2 $ ] days",
    ". consequently , the absorber must be at least 2.8  pc away from the source to not be affected .",
    "although only crude lower limits , these estimates already clearly exclude the blr , which is approximately 0.003  pc away from the source @xcite . for comparison with previous estimates , @xcite place emission by highly - ionized species ( e.g. , ) just outside the blr , while @xcite give an upper limit of 30  pc for the x - ray  and uv  gas .    note",
    "that despite the fluctuations over time scales of days , the average x - ray  flux in ngc  3783  has remained steady over the past few years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . under these conditions and at a distance @xmath33  0.5",
    "pc , the ionization state of the absorber does not react to the short time - scale fluctuations , but instead it is governed entirely by the mean flux .",
    "indeed , @xcite point out that the shape of the x - ray  absorption spectrum of ngc  3783is unchanged since 1996 when it was measured with _ asca _ , although the continuum level has clearly varied during that period .",
    "a study of spectral variability on intermediate time scales of a few months using fractions of the 900  ks hetgs  observation is bound to shed new light on the behavior of ngc  3783  in time ( netzer  et  al . , in preparation ) .",
    "the fact that the absorption in the spectrum does not vary significantly during the course of our observation justifies the treatment of the 280  ks time integrated spectrum as a whole for studying the absorption .",
    "furthermore , when we compare the present average spectrum with earlier observations @xcite , we still find no significant discrepancies .",
    "consequently , for the most part the best - fit model proposed by @xcite describes the current spectrum rather well .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "4 where the slab model from @xcite is compared with the current 280  ks spectrum .",
    "no adjustment whatsoever has been applied to the model , including no re - normalization .",
    "noticeable discrepancies between data and model occur in the details around the o k@xmath34 region between 14  and 24   .",
    "these could not have been modeled properly with the first 40  ks exposure due to lack of counts in the narrow lines present in this range .",
    "in this work , we focus on the  - complex in the wavelength range 17.3  - 24.7  .",
    "the goal is to measure individual emission and absorption line fluxes . due to considerable blending ,",
    "a simultaneous fit of many spectral features is required .",
    "we fit the spectrum locally with a power - law plus an ensemble of individual - ion absorption models and a few ( unabsorbed ) emission lines .",
    "subsequently , galactic absorption ( @xmath35  = 8.7@xmath1310@xmath36  @xmath27 ) is applied to the entire spectrum .",
    "the models are based on atomic data calculated with hullac  @xcite and include all of the inner - shell atomic transitions and their autoionization widths for all ions and elements that appear in the spectrum .",
    "a similar method has been successfully applied to several previous agn  spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "out of four velocity components resolved in the uv  ( e.g. , for ) , of which two are marginally resolved with hetgs  in lines of and @xcite , the rgsreveals only one blended trough .",
    "indeed , the blueshifts measured here ( @xmath37600 km  s@xmath4 ) are consistent with the mean velocity of the two dominant ( & slowest ) components in the uv  and are in agreement with the velocity measured with hetgs",
    ". thus , in the model , we use only one velocity component for each ion .",
    "we fit for the turbulent velocity width and obtain @xmath38  km  s@xmath4(i.e .",
    ", @xmath39  = 120  km  s@xmath4 , fwhm  = 280   km  s@xmath4 ) .",
    "this width is very close to the value of 150  km  s@xmath4  used by @xcite .",
    "both here and in @xcite , this velocity width was used because it enables the fitting of entire series of lines with a single kinematic component .",
    "however , it should be clear that the actual absorption troughs comprise more than one intrinsic velocity component and are broader .",
    "in fact , @xcite measured directly @xmath40  = 500 @xmath7  170  km  s@xmath4 . in fitting the spectrum , we assume a covering factor of unity , which is an approximation for the value of 0.8 obtained by @xcite , who fit for the covering factor of the x - ray  observed components in the uv  spectra .",
    "the present velocity - blended spectrum is not sensitive to this difference .",
    "emission lines are modeled by gaussians .",
    "none of these approximations hamper the good estimates we get for the total column density in each ion and for the total flux in each emission line , which are the physical quantities of interest here .    the best - fit spectral model for the o region",
    "is given in figs .",
    "5 and  6 , highlighting respectively the k@xmath34 and k@xmath21 ( and higher ) transition regions .",
    "the good fit , including that for the high - order lines of the he - like series below 19   , is apparent in the figures .",
    "absorption by all charge states from down to is clearly detected .",
    "it is obvious from the figures that it is crucial to fit all charge states simultaneously , including both absorption and emission , in order to obtain the correct physical measurements .",
    "the various ions are found outflowing at ( indistinguishable ) centroid velocities of @xmath6470  - @xmath6800 km  s@xmath4  with respect to the systemic velocity of ngc  3783 .",
    "the fitted parameters for each of these ions are given in table  1 .    evidently , the broad range of charge states observed along the line of sight is ubiquitous to seyfert outflows @xcite .",
    "it is also observed in seyfert  2 galaxies @xcite .",
    "if all charge states are present at similar distances from the central source , as observed directly in seyfert  2 s , it implies a strong density gradient of 3 - 4 orders of magnitude ( e.g. , for to ) over relatively short distances . in turn ,",
    "comparable column densities together with a strong density gradient would imply that the highly - ionized gas occupies a much larger volume than the less - ionized gas .",
    "this picture is consistent with a wind that emanates from a dense object ( e.g. , accretion disk or bloated stars ) .",
    "it then accelerates , expands and becomes hotter and more ionized .",
    "pressure equilibrium also favors the hotter gas being more tenuous and therefore more extended .",
    "in addition to the high charge states , weak absorption by and may also take place in ( the rest frame of ) ngc  3783  as indicated in fig .",
    "5 . however",
    ", blending with other ions hampers an unambiguous detection . the k@xmath34 line in ngc  3783  overlaps with the strongest absorption lines of at 23.529    @xcite",
    ". the k@xmath34 line in ngc  3783  can not be resolved from the local galactic k@xmath34 line in our own galaxy . is not detected .",
    "nevertheless , since we simultaneously fit many lines from each ion , we are able to overcome the problem of blending to some extent and to provide upper limits to the ionic column densities . of course , these constrains are not as tight as those provided by uv  measurements for the same ions , when those are available @xcite .",
    "the errors on the outflow velocities are relatively large due to the wavelength channel widths of the rgs . estimating the uncertainty to be bound by 3 channels implies an error range of @xmath7  16.5 m  corresponding at 22    to @xmath7  230  km  s@xmath4  as quoted in table  1 .",
    "the best - fit column densities are also given in table  1 .",
    "the column densities of and are constrained most tightly by their detected photoelectric edges .",
    "an additional constraint is imposed by fitting entire series of lines ( see also fig .  6 ) .",
    "the values of ( 1.0 @xmath7  0.3 ) and ( 4.0 @xmath7  1.0 )  @xmath13  10@xmath41  @xmath27  obtained for the column densities of and , respectively , are in excellent agreement with the values of 1.1 and 4.3  @xmath13  10@xmath41  @xmath27  obtained by @xcite .",
    "the ion is of particular interest for the possible connection between the uv  and x - ray  absorbers .",
    "inner - shell absorption can be observed in the present spectrum although only marginally .",
    "we detect the k@xmath34 line at a significance of about 2 sigma over a total of 4 wavelength channels , but the errors on the data points are still too large to see the line profile clearly ( compare data with continuum model in fig .  5 ) .",
    "the feature at 19.33    can be associated with the k@xmath21 line , although it is mostly due to k@xmath42 ( see fig .",
    "the derived column density of is much higher than that of .",
    "this is due to the closed shell structure of and to the pervasively low fractional abundance of the li - like species ( @xmath43  0.25 , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "to that end , and li - like ions in general are perhaps the least favorable vestige for probing the ionized outflow in agn .",
    "the precise restframe wavelengths of the k@xmath34 inner - shell transitions in o ions have yet to be measured in the laboratory and are still somewhat in debate @xcite . here",
    ", we use wavelength values for k@xmath34 and k@xmath21 of 22.01 and 19.34  , respectively . with a fitted turbulent velocity of 170  km  s@xmath4",
    ", we obtain only an upper limit to the column density of 2.0 @xmath13 10@xmath10  @xmath27 .",
    "this is loosely consistent with @xcite , who find a lower limit of 0.63@xmath13 10@xmath10  @xmath27for the total column density in the two corresponding uv  components .",
    "we note that there was a hint to the k@xmath34 line of in the 900  ks hetgs  spectrum @xcite , but there , the lower statistical quality did not allow for a definite identification .",
    "the present high - quality spectrum reveals an absorption feature at 21.64    ( 21.43    in fig .  5 at the rest frame of ngc  3783 ) .",
    "we identify it tentatively as absorption by in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . given this interpretation ,",
    "the gas would be at a redshift of @xmath44  = 0.0018 @xmath7  0.0008 .",
    "the absorption parameters deduced for this line are given in table  1 .",
    "another possible identification for this line could be ( 21.49    in the rest frame ) in the outflow of ngc  3783 , but lines by neighboring charge states of ca are not as obvious in the spectrum , which casts doubt on the identification of ca .",
    "since this feature may not be related to ngc  3783 , we defer a more careful analysis of it to a separate paper .",
    "there is a hint of this line in the 900  ks hetgs  spectrum , but there it seems to be at 21.60   ( as opposed to 21.43   ) , where local would be expected . in any event , due to the lower statistical quality of the hetgs  observation in this spectral band , @xcite conclude that it is insignificant .",
    "in addition to the numerous absorption lines , a few bright , narrow emission lines are present in the spectrum . in the o region of the spectrum ,",
    "the brightest emission lines are ly@xmath34 at @xmath17  19    and the he@xmath34 triplet of at @xmath17  22    ( the resonance , intercombination , and forbidden lines - @xmath45 ) .",
    "the radiative recombination continuum ( rrc ) of is also detected , although its location at 16.8   in the midst of the fe - m 2p  - 3d uta  makes a precise determination of its flux rather difficult .",
    "in fact , it is much better resolved with hetgs  ( fig .  6 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the weaker and k@xmath21 as well as higher - order emission lines have been identified with hetgs  @xcite , but here the lower spectral resolution impedes the measurement of their flux .",
    "the measurable o emission features are listed in table  2 .",
    "fitting for a uniform velocity width for all emission lines , we obtain a turbulent velocity of 740 @xmath7 140  km  s@xmath4  ( fwhm  1220 @xmath7  230  km  s@xmath4 ) .",
    "@xcite measured a fwhm  of 930 @xmath7 350  km  s@xmath4  for the most isolated @xmath46-line .",
    "previous optical measurements by @xcite of narrow , forbidden emission lines of highly - ionized species in ngc  3783  show a consistent linear increase in velocity width with ionization energy . the presently measured width of 1220  km  s@xmath4  fwhm  for fits that trend perfectly ( see their fig .",
    ", we are not able to provide an independent measurement of the emission line width , because there are no non - absorbed ( forbidden ) lines in the spectrum .    as evident from figs .  5 and  6",
    ", the emission / absorption model fits the data ( including the intricate line profiles ) remarkably well .",
    "this gives confidence in the individual ( de - blended ) line fluxes obtained .",
    "all of the measured emission lines are slightly redshifted by about 300 @xmath7  230  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "owing to the large errors , this is still consistent with the mean shift of 130 @xmath7  290  km  s@xmath4  measured for the emission lines with hetgs@xcite .",
    "these redshifts together with the complex p - cygni type profiles seen for the resonance lines are suggestive of a bipolar outflow as discussed in detail below .",
    "also presented in table  2 are the line fluxes measured with hetgs .",
    "the current values are in good agreement with the hetgs  values .",
    "the largest discrepancies are found for the resonance lines , which have complicated p - cygni type profiles [ ly@xmath34 and he@xmath34(@xmath47 ) ] .",
    "this is due to the different methods used for measuring the line fluxes .",
    "for example , @xcite did not fit for overlapping absorption and did not require the widths of the three lines to be uniform .",
    "nonetheless , the general agreement between the two measurements implies no time variation as expected for the narrow line region ( nlr ) .",
    "to summarize the x - ray  outflow kinematics in the rest frame of the agn  as manifested by the absorption and emission lines : the emission lines are redshifted by about 300  @xmath7  230  km  s@xmath4  and have fwhm  of 1220  @xmath7  230  km  s@xmath4  ( present work ) .",
    "the absorption lines are blueshifted by about @xmath6600  @xmath7  150  km  s@xmath4  and have a fwhm  of 820  @xmath7  280  km  s@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "although it is impossible to constrain the exact shape of the x - ray  line profiles and in particular their broad wings , due to the crowded nature of this waveband and the overlapping emission and absorption , it is obvious that high - velocity gas ( up to @xmath171000  km  s@xmath4 ) is both emitting and absorbing x - rays . for the resonance lines ,",
    "p - cygni type profiles are observed ( figs .  5 & 6 ) .",
    "these line profiles are characteristic of a bipolar , non - collimated outflow in conjunction with absorption by the outflow along the line of sight .",
    "it is important to point out that we have only approximated these profiles by emission and ( slightly offset ) absorption lines , but the comparable velocity widths obtained for the absorption and emission lines already supports the biconical interpretation .",
    "we wish to further compare the x - ray  line emission and absorption in ngc  3783 . in the context of seyfert  2 galaxies",
    ", it has been shown that intensity ratios among the he - like emission lines can be used to decisively determine the column density through the emitting plasma @xcite even when the absorption spectrum is not available to us directly due to orientation &  obscuration effects .",
    "the present emission line fluxes give ratios of @xmath48 = 1.5 @xmath7  0.3 and @xmath49 = 0.5 @xmath7  0.2 . with the velocity width of 740  km  s@xmath4 , this @xmath48 value is obtained in our model at an ionic column density of ( 1.1 @xmath7  0.35 ) @xmath13 10@xmath41  @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath49 ratio provides just a lower limit of 1.3  @xmath13  10@xmath41  @xmath27 .",
    "these ranges are both in good agreement with the ionic column density of ( 1.0 @xmath7  0.3 ) @xmath13  10@xmath41  @xmath27  measured directly from the absorption lines and edge of .",
    "next , it would have been useful to compare the fractional ionic abundances derived from the emission lines with those derived from the absorption . however , direct comparison is not available since recombination - driven lines are due to the next ionized state ( e.g. , for ly@xmath34 ) .",
    "hence , the & emission line intensities reflect the @xmath50 abundance ratio , while the absorption column densities reflect @xmath51 .",
    "nevertheless , the comparable emission line fluxes and column densities of and suggest that all highly - ionized states are fairly abundant in the emitting plasma , just as they are in the absorbing plasma .",
    "moreover , it is possible to find an ionization parameter @xmath18  =  30  erg  s@xmath4  cm that reproduces just the right amount of and emission and absorption , which we observe .",
    "clearly , we are seeing a very broad distribution in @xmath18 , but for simplicity , this single value can be used to describe the & spectral features . in summary ,",
    "the velocity widths , the column densities , and the fractional abundances all make it tempting to interpret the x - rayemitter and absorber as arising from the same gas .",
    "the measured emission line flux @xmath52 ( e.g. , of an o  ion ) can be related to the volume ( @xmath53 ) emission measure @xmath54 as follows :    @xmath55    the computed line power @xmath56 is defined through the line emissivity @xmath57 ( i.e. , number of line photons emitted in the plasma per unit time and per unit volume ) . here , @xmath58 is the number density of ions with charge @xmath59 .",
    "the line power takes into account all line - driving mechanisms and in particular recombination , radiative cascades , and photoexcitation .",
    "the fraction of ions with charge  @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) is denoted by  @xmath61 . for recombination - driven emission lines such as the present ones ,",
    "the most relevant fraction is @xmath62 . in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , @xmath63 represents the oxygen elemental abundance relative to hydrogen .",
    "the distance to the source @xmath64 is taken , for the case of ngc  3783 , to be 41.8  mpc . in a fully ionized cosmic plasma",
    ", we can also relate the electron density to the hydrogen density by @xmath65  = 1.2  @xmath66 . on the other hand ,",
    "the column density @xmath35 can be written as follows :    @xmath67    the measured ionic column densities @xmath68 are related to @xmath35 by @xmath68=  @xmath69 .",
    "the minimal and maximal distances for absorbing gas in the outflow are denoted by @xmath70 and @xmath71 . to obtain the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we used @xmath65  = @xmath72 .",
    "we focus here on the and spectral features as the tracers of the very highly - ionized gas simply because they exhibit the best measurable features in our spectrum .",
    "however , since seyfert  2 observations show that all charge states co - exist and overlap in space along the outflow , we expect the present analysis of o  ions to be applicable to the entire highly - ionized plasma .",
    "we choose an ionization parameter of @xmath18  = 30  erg  s@xmath4 cm , where ionization balance calculations give @xmath73  1.7 ( in accord with the emission line ratio ) and @xmath74  4 ( in accord with the absorption column densities ) .",
    "this implies @xmath61 values of 0.14 , 0.57 , and 0.29 , respectively for , , & .",
    "again , a single value of @xmath18 is assumed in this section just for simplicity .",
    "the observed broad distribution in @xmath18 makes it clear that each ion exists mostly around its typical range of @xmath18 .",
    "equations  ( 1 ) &  ( 2 ) can not be solved for the most general case and some approximations need to be made . in the following",
    "we explore the two extreme scenarios : @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "first , we explore the possibility of a well localized x - ray  plasma , i.e. , one in which the typical size @xmath77 is much smaller than the average distance @xmath47 from the ionizing source . in that case",
    ", the localization in @xmath47 immediately imposes a narrow distribution in @xmath65 ( through @xmath18 ) .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) can then be rewritten simply as : @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "even now , these equations can not yet be solved separately . however , if one identifies the emitter with the absorber , both equations can be solved simultaneously .",
    "indeed , by using eqs .",
    "( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and the definition of @xmath18 to solve for @xmath47 , @xmath80 , and @xmath65 one would expect to obtain a rough idea of these quantities . however , using the present measurements for the forbidden line and for the ly@xmath34 line , in both cases , we obtain values of @xmath81  10  pc .",
    "this suggests that the confined geometry ( @xmath82 ) is inadequate for describing the highly - ionized outflow of ngc  3783 , at least as long as the line emission and absorption are due to the same outflow constituent .",
    "all of the measured and derived quantities are summarized in table  3 .      inspired by the _",
    "chandra _",
    "x - ray  images of seyfert  2 galaxies @xcite , we propose an alternative geometry of two ionization cones with an opening solid angle @xmath83 . in ngc  1068 ,",
    "agn  driven x - rays  are detected as far as 500  kpc away from the nucleus @xcite .",
    "furthermore , young et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) & @xcite show that the x - ray  nlr  in ngc  1068 overlaps on the plane of the sky with the optical nlr .",
    "extended ionization cones in seyfert  1 s , only oriented along the line of sight , would substantiate the unified theory of agn  @xcite in the x - ray  regime .",
    "unfortunately , it is impossible to distinguish between clumpy clouds and ionization cones in ngc  3783  by means of x - ray  imaging , as even the best angular resolution available with _",
    "chandra_(0.5 ) corresponds to 100  pc at the distance of ngc  3783 .",
    "therefore , we have to make use of the spectrum .    in the ionization cones scenario ,",
    "the plasma covers a large range of distances ( and densities ) and it is necessary to revert to the integral forms of @xmath54 and @xmath35 in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) with @xmath84 .",
    "note that even within the framework of the extended geometry and even when @xmath85 , for a given @xmath18 most of the absorption occurs close to @xmath70 , while the actual size of the cones ( i.e. , @xmath71 ) can not be well constrained by the observation .",
    "indeed , eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) can now be rewritten as :    @xmath86    and    @xmath87    in this scenario , since eq .",
    "( 3 ) is attained from the column density alone without the emission measure , the result for @xmath70 is independent of the emission .",
    "thus , it is independent of the assumption that the x - ray  emitter and absorber represent the same plasma .",
    "( 3 ) &  ( 4 ) demonstrate the dependence of the derived values on the assumption for @xmath18 .",
    "thus , if actually forms at @xmath18-values somewhat lower than we assume ( 30  erg  s@xmath4  cm ) , we would be slightly underestimating @xmath70 and overestimating @xmath83 , and vice versa .",
    "we stress that the focus on a certain ion or on a specific value of @xmath18 constitutes a complementary and totally consistent approach with the observation of a broad range of charge states .",
    "again , analogous to the seyfert  2 case , each charge state could be present throughout the cone , only at different densities , while at the same time different charge states are co - located thanks to the steep density gradients at each point in the cone .",
    "the x - ray  observation simply traces and wherever they are along the cone .",
    "we now substitute the measured values into eqs .",
    "( 3 ) & ( 4 ) using the data for the forbidden line and for the ly@xmath34 line .",
    "these values as well as the results for @xmath70 and for @xmath83 are summarized in table  3 .",
    "the electron density is again @xmath88 , but here it decreases rapidly ( @xmath89 ) along the cone . in table",
    "3 we give the maximal @xmath65 value attained at @xmath70 .",
    "it can be seen that the results for both and for suggest consistently that the x - ray  emitter / absorber lies at @xmath90  10  pc .",
    "the maximal densities are of the order of 600 @xmath3 .",
    "these results are not very different from those obtained by @xcite , who do not assume a cone geometry , but give values of @xmath1  50  @xmath3  and @xmath91  30  pc .",
    "the typical opening angle @xmath83/2@xmath92 we get for each of the two cones is about 15  - 25  % , fully consistent with the fraction of seyfert galaxies that show a highly - ionized absorbing outflow ( @xmath1750% of the seyfert  1 s ) .",
    "the presently proposed geometry with the high @xmath70 and @xmath83 values makes for a large scale outflow that from our perspective would entirely blanket the central agn  region including the blr , provided that the ionization cone is uniformly filled .",
    "since @xcite find that at some radial velocities the blr  is only partially covered by the uv  outflow , identifying the uv  absorber with the extended x - ray  ionization cone would require that some of the blrbe observed directly , i.e. , through ( velocity - specific ) holes in the cone .",
    "we note that @xcite estimate for ngc  5548 much smaller opening angles , @xmath83/2@xmath93  0.5% .",
    "however , that result was obtained by assuming a mass loss rate that is equal to the mass accretion rate ( with a luminosity efficiency of 5% ) .",
    "if this assumption is relaxed , extended ionization cones may be applicable for ngc  5548 as well .",
    "indeed , the high values for @xmath83 in ngc  3783  imply that the outflow mass loss rate exceed the accretion rate as discussed in the following section .      by integrating the mass density @xmath94 ( where @xmath95  =  1.3 is the average atomic weight for a solar - abundance plasma ) over the ionization cone ( or clouds ) , it is possible to estimate the total mass @xmath96 and similarly the mass loss rate @xmath97 in the outflow .",
    "these quantities are listed in table  3 for both the localized and ionization cone models . in the ionization cone model ,",
    "the total mass depends on @xmath98 , which is not well constrained by the observation .",
    "therefore , the mass in table  3 is normalized to @xmath99 . taking an outflow velocity of @xmath6600  km  s@xmath4",
    ", we obtain a total mass loss rate of up to a few solar masses per year .",
    "we compare this with an estimate of the mass accretion rate . with a bolometric luminosity of 4.5@xmath1310@xmath100  erg s@xmath4  @xcite and a gravitation - to - light conversion efficiency of @xmath101 )  =  5% , ngc  3783  would be accreting about 0.2 solar masses per year .",
    "if all these numbers are correct , then ngc  3783  is accreting only about 10% of the mass it is ejecting .",
    "although this is a surprisingly low accretion efficiency , we are not aware of any hard evidence against it . furthermore , ultra - high velocity outflows ( @xmath170.1c ) have been discovered recently in several agn .",
    "it has been postulated that the high mass loss rate observed in these sources is due to their high accretion rate @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "narrow line seyfert 1 s such as ngc  3783  could be the low - mass facet of this phenomenon .",
    "it is worth stressing that the errors given in table  3 reflect only those due to the presently measured @xmath68 & @xmath52 values .",
    "indeed , the present mass estimates should be treated with more caution as the x - ray  outflow of ngc  3783  is undoubtedly more complex than a simple , continuous cone , which was assumed here .",
    "nonetheless , these estimates are good enough to rule out radically different scenarios , such as the highly - localized one .",
    "most likely , the true picture for ngc  3783  is somewhat less extreme than @xmath76 and therefore @xmath70 could be somewhat less than 10  pc , but certainly not much less , given the timing constrains obtained in sec .",
    "2.2 of @xmath103 0.5  pc for o - k and @xmath103 2.8  pc for fe - m .",
    "the extended ionization cones stand in contrast with interpretations of two other seyfert  1 galaxies .",
    "@xcite , based on observed recombination times , place the ionized absorber in ngc  3516 about 0.2  pc away from the nucleus . @xcite and",
    "@xcite even suggest that part of the ionized absorber in ngc  7469 is closer to the nucleus than the blr . in both of these cases ,",
    "the observers find that the uv  and x - ray  absorbers are connected .",
    "more importantly , the present results are in stark contrast with the parameters derived by @xcite for ngc  3783  based on uv  absorption , which according to those authors occurs at sub - parsec distances in tiny clouds the size of @xmath104  10@xmath16  cm . at the heart of the argument of @xcite",
    "lies the absorption by the multiplet at 1175   detected in the high - velocity uv  component ( -1300  km  s@xmath4 ) . following @xcite , @xcite take this feature as evidence for high - density gas ( @xmath33  10@xmath2  @xmath3 ) in this component , which inevitably restricts it to clumps very close to the source .",
    "we wish to point out that the 2s2p triplet complex from which those lines are absorbed , can in fact be populated at lower densities . only one fine - structure level in the triplet",
    "requires high densities ( see , e.g. , fig . 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but absorption from the other two levels of the triplet may be possible at low densities and might be producing the lines at 1175    observed by @xcite .    on the other hand , it may also be possible that dense clouds reside at the base of the ionization cone where the outflow is clumpy , less ionized , and thus absorbs uv  light . further out in the outflow , perhaps , the ejecta evaporate , become much more tenuous and consequently more highly - ionized . these more extended parts of the outflow might then constitute the x - rayabsorbing / emitting gas .",
    "however , following @xcite and @xcite , we note that the very similar velocity structure in the x - ray  and uv  absorption systems strongly suggests that the two coincide and most likely are two different manifestations of the same outflow . finally , based on uv  variability and recombination times ,",
    "@xcite also arrive at the conclusion that the x - ray  and uv  absorbers are more than 10  pc away from the ionizing source .",
    "a paramount difference between the uv - derived and x - ray - derived parameters of the outflow lies in the corresponding @xmath96 and @xmath97 values . in the @xcite picture ,",
    "the calculated @xmath96 and @xmath97 values are more than 10 orders of magnitude smaller than the values derived here from the x - ray  measurement ( see table  3 ) . according to the uv  interpretation",
    ", the outflow carries insignificant mass and energy out of the agn  system , while according to the present x - ray  analysis , the outflow must play a major role in the mass and energy budgets of the agn .",
    "the present 280  ks observation of ngc  3783  leads to a few interesting conclusions , which can be summarized as follows :    1 .   despite the continuum increasing by up to a factor of 2 during the 280  ks observation ,",
    "no significant effect on the absorption structure has been detected .",
    "the fact that the absorbing plasma did not respond to the increase in flux within , say , 1  day places it at least 0.5  pc ( o - k ) to 2.8  pc ( fe - m ) away from the continuum source , regardless of its geometry or physical situation ( e.g. , density ) .",
    "the interpretation of the x - ray  line absorbing and emitting plasma being closely connected , or actually being manifestations of the same outflow , is very tempting given the p - cygni type profiles as well as the similar velocity widths , inferred column densities , and ionization distributions .",
    "3 .   assuming that the two components are connected rules out the localized geometry ( @xmath105 and @xmath106  @xmath3 ) for the x - ray  plasma .",
    "this geometry was suggested by @xcite for the uv  absorbing outflow .",
    "4 .   instead",
    ", we propose diffuse gas in the form of ionization cones .",
    "these cones may not be closer than about 10  pc from the ionizing source and must therefore have much lower densities ( a few 100 @xmath3  and decreasing with distance ) . in this case , we find that the mass loss rate in the outflow is significant , of the order of a solar mass per year",
    "the conflict with the clumpy cloudlet description of @xcite could possibly be due to erroneous use of the multiplet at 1175    as a density diagnostic , but it could also be resolved if the uv  absorber lies at the base of the ionization cone in the form of clouds .",
    "this constituent then represents a transient phase of the gas as it expands , ionizes , and transforms into the much more extended and more tenuous x - ray  plasma .",
