    "this is mainly because millimeter observations can not trace warm ( @xmath5 40 k ) and dense ( @xmath5 6 @xmath3 10@xmath8 @xmath7 ) regions of envelopes due to the contamination from extended low - density ( @xmath1 10@xmath6 @xmath7 ) and cold ( @xmath1 10 k ) gas .",

    "the inclination angle of the associated outflow from the plan of the sky in l483 is estimated to be @xmath1 45@xmath4 and there appears a weak redshifted outflow component at the western side ( @xcite ) , whereas the inclination angle in b335 is derived to be @xmath1 10@xmath4 and there are also redshifted and blueshifted outflow components at the east and west of the protostar , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "although the main outflow component of the blueshifted and redshifted gas locates at the west and east of the central source of l483 ( @xcite ) and and at the east and west of b335 ( @xcite ) , it is possible that the observed submillimeter emission trace those other outflow components incidentally . in such a case ,",
    "the velocity gradient in the submillimeter emission shows the opposite sense to that of the main velocity gradient traced by the millimeter lines .",
    "the observed elongation of the submillimeter emission along the outflow axis in l483 favors this interpretation , and the higher - temperature ( @xmath5 40 k ) gas at the western extension in l483 discussed in the previous subsection may reflect the shock interaction between the outflow and the ambient dense gas ( @xcite ) .    another possible and more interesting interpretation of the observed velocity structures in the submillimeter lines is an expanding gas motion which is perpendicular to the outflow axis , as shown in figure 11 .",
    "this figure demonstrates that the submillimeter lines trace molecular gas at the surface of the flattened disklike envelope , which is being stripped away by some mechanism such as the stellar wind , while the millimeter lines trace infalling gas at the midplane of the envelope . here , on the side of the blueshifted outflow",
    "the expanding gas is observed as a redshifted component and on the side of the redshifted outflow as a blueshifted component , while the infalling gas components show the same velocity gradient as that of the outflow .",
    "hence , this configuration can explain the different velocity gradient observed in the submillimeter lines from that of the outflow components or infalling gas traced by the millimeter lines .",
    "similar velocity structures along the perpendicular direction to the polar outflow have also been found in near - infrared observations of young stellar objects .",
    "pyo et al . (",
    "2005 ) have observed lower - velocity [ fe ii ] winds with a wide opening angle of @xmath1 100@xmath4 in l1551 irs5 , as well as well - collimated higher - velocity jets along the polar axis .",
    "comparable results were also obtained for the young t tauri star dg tau ( @xcite ) .",
    "they suggest that such a wind with a wide opening angle will be effective in sweeping up envelope material from the close vicinity of its driving source .",
    "the observed velocity structures in the submillimeter lines may trace such a gas motion in the envelope , although the spatial scale in the submillimeter results ( @xmath10 2000 au ) is much larger than that of the infrared observations ( @xmath1 100 - 400 au ) . in l483 , the line core emission in the hco@xmath18 ( 32 ) line",
    "does show the same velocity gradient as our submillimeter results , while the hco@xmath18 ( 32 ) line wing emission traces the bipolar outflow itself ( see figure 15 in @xcite ) . at the surface of the flattened disklike envelopes molecular gas",
    "is irradiated by the stellar photons and hence the gas temperature is likely to be higher than that at the midplane .",
    "then , the warmer surface regions are selectively traced by the submillimeter observations whereas the colder , infalling regions at the midplane are traced by the millimeter lines alone .",
    "in fact , spaans et al .",
    "( 1995 ) proposed that the narrow @xmath47co and @xmath20co @xmath0=65 emission observed toward many low - mass young stellar objects is produced at the surface of the circumstellar envelope surrounding the cavity evacuated by the bipolar outflow , heated by the radiation field generated in the inner part of the accretion disk .",
    "recent two - dimensional radiative transfer models in protostellar envelopes have also revealed that at the surface of the flattened disklike envelope the gas temperature becomes higher than that predicted from spherically symmetric models ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observed submillimeter hcn and cs emission may have such an origin .",
    "the interpretation of the expanding flattened envelope , however , has one weak point , that is , in l483 the observed submillimeter emissions are elongated @xmath48 the outflow direction .",
    "if the submillimeter lines trace expanding gas motion at the surface of the disklike envelope , the elongation should be perpendicular to the axis of the associated outflow . in order to compensate for this contradiction , non polar - symmetric geometry and/or the flared shape of the envelope must be incorporated . with the present data , we can not determine which scenario , the incidental projection effect or the expanding flattened envelope with the flared and/or non polar - symmetric shape , is more plausible .    on the other hand ,",
    "we have also found an opposite velocity gradient in the submillimeter lines to that in the millimeter lines across the outflow axis in b335 .",
    "the origin of the difference is less clear , but the expanding gas traced by the submillimeter lines may have a different rotational motion . in any sense ,",
    "our new submillimeter mapping observations have presented us an implication that submillimeter lines trace different kinematics from that traced by millimeter lines , and that there is another velocity structure which previous millimeter observations could not find in low - mass protostellar envelopes .",
    "we have made mapping observations of low - mass protostellar envelopes of l483 and b335 as well as a single - point observation of l723 in the hcn ( @xmath0=43 ) and cs ( @xmath0=76 ) lines with aste .",
    "main results of our new submillimeter observations are summarized as follows .",
    "* we have detected both the hcn and cs lines toward all the sources .",
    "typical intensities and line widths are 0.5 k and 2.0 km s@xmath24 in the hcn line and 1.0 k and 1.5 km s@xmath24 in the cs line , respectively .",
    "the cs - to - hcn intensity ratio is similar across the three samples ( 2.1 - 2.5 ) , and there may be a correlation between the source luminosity and the intensity of the submillimeter lines . *",
    "mapping observations of l483 in the hcn and cs lines show that the submillimeter emissions are extended to the west of the protostar , consistent with the distribution of the dust continuum emission , and that the deconvolved size is @xmath1 5500 au @xmath3 3700 au ( p.a .",
    "= 78@xmath4 ) in the hcn emission .",
    "the extent of the submillimeter emissions in l483 implies the presence of higher - temperature ( @xmath5 40 k ) or higher - density ( @xmath5 6 @xmath3 10@xmath8 @xmath7 ) gas at 4000 au away from the central protostar .",
    "the existence of such high - temperature or high - density gas at 4000 au away from the protostar is unlikely to be explained via heating from the central protostar with the spherically symmetric geometry in the envelope . * both in l483 and b335 , we found velocity gradients in the submillimeter lines along and across the axis of the associated molecular outflow .",
    "the sense of the velocity gradient traced by the submillimeter lines along the outflow direction is opposite to that of the results from the previous millimeter observations or the associated molecular outflow itself , both in l483 and b335 .",
    "one possible interpretation of the different velocity gradient is that the submillimeter lines trace the other side of the conical shape of the outflow incidentally , where the outflow axis is close to the plane of the sky . alternatively ,",
    "expanding gas motions at the surface of the flattened disklike envelopes , or gas motions to strip off the envelope , irradiated from the central star directly , can explain the observed submillimeter velocity structure .",
