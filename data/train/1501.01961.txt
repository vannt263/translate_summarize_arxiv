    "explosions of 2d models , however , start late and their energies tend to be fairly low ( except for those of @xcite , whose results still need better explanation and confirmation by detailed comparisons with other recent simulations ) .",

    "turbulent fragmentation by energy cascading from large to small scales , however , seems to disfavor and delay explosions in 3d , because it destroys the biggest convective plumes , which were recognized as helful for 2d explosions @xcite .",
    "therefore @xcite are worried about even less favorable explosion conditions when resolution shortcomings of all current 3d models can be overcome , and @xcite advocate pre - collapse progenitor - core asymmetries as possible solution of the dilemma .    here",
    "we present the first successful 3d simulation of a neutrino - driven sn explosion of a 9.6@xmath0 iron - core star computed fully self - consistently with the neutrino - hydrodynamics code prometheus - vertex .",
    "we identify , for the first time , consequences of 3d turbulence in the convective gain layer that enhance the explosion energy and accelerate shock expansion in 3d relative to 2d . while so far in more massive progenitors 3d turbulence appears less supportive for the initiation of explosions than 2d flows ( cf .",

    "we used the prometheus - vertex hydrodynamics code with three - flavor , energy - dependent , ray - by - ray - plus ( rbr+ ) neutrino transport including the full set of neutrino reactions and microphysics @xcite applied in 3d also by @xcite and @xcite , in particular the high - density equation of state of @xcite with a nuclear incompressibility of @xmath5mev .",
    "our simulations were conducted with a 1d gravity potential ( which is unproblematic for nearly spherical explosions ) including general relativistic corrections @xcite .",
    "for the first time we employed the newly implemented axis - free yin - yang grid @xcite .",

    "the radial grid had a reflecting boundary condition at the coordinate center and an inflow condition at the outer boundary of @xmath8 cm .",
    "it had 400 nonequidistant zones initially and was refined in steps up to @xmath2600 zones , providing an increasingly better resolution of @xmath90.01 ... 0.004 around the gain radius .",
    "for the neutrino transport 12 geometrically spaced energy bins with an upper bound of 380mev were used .",
    "the relatively steep density gradient above the iron core enables a neutrino - driven explosion of the 9.6@xmath0 star at roughly 300ms after bounce even in 1d ( left panels in fig .",

    "the energy of such a late explosion , however , remains low , only @xmath10erg ( fig .",
    "[ fig : explosion ] ) , because it is provided mainly by the recombination of free nucleons to @xmath11-particles and iron - group nuclei in the gain layer ( see @xcite ) and the corresponding mass at @xmath12ms is only 2.2@xmath13 in 1d .",
    "of course , the subsequent neutrino - driven wind from the proto - neutron star ( pns ) will increase the power of the explosion .",

    "[ fig : mass_shells ] ) and mass shells leaving the pns surface indicate that the compact remnant begins to lose material in the low - density , high - entropy baryonic wind driven by neutrino heating above the neutrinosphere .    in our multi - dimensional simulations the shock stagnates only for @xmath1120130ms and then expands to @xmath27 km at 400ms postbounce ( p.b .",

    "the diagnostic energy reaches @xmath30 in 3d with an increase at a rate of @xmath1(0.75 ... @xmath31ergs@xmath26 due to the pns wind for the cases of minimal and maximal energy , respectively , whereas it is only @xmath1(0.67 ... @xmath32erg in 2d with a similar growth rate by the pns - wind power as in 3d4% variations of @xmath33 . ] .",

    "while the onset of the explosion in multi - dimensions is aided by buoyant convection , the steeper rise of the explosion energy in 3d can be understood by a smaller net energy - loss rate , @xmath34 , in the neutrino - cooling layer during 100ms@xmath35ms ( fig .",
    "[ fig : explosion ] ) .",
    "@xmath34 is evaluated between the mean gain radius , @xmath36 , and an inner radius @xmath37 , which is ( somewhat arbitrarily ) defined at an optical depth of 3 for @xmath38 ( all quantities are evaluated on angle - averaged profiles ) . in contrast , the integrated net neutrino - heating rate in the gain layer , @xmath39 , and the heating efficiency , @xmath40 ( with @xmath41 being the direction - averaged luminosities of @xmath38 and @xmath42 ) , do not exhibit any significant 3d-2d differences ( fig .",
    "[ fig : explosion ] ) .",
    "the reduced energy - loss rate in the cooling layer for 100ms@xmath35ms is associated with a systematically lower specific internal energy , @xmath43 , averaged over the cooling - layer mass @xmath44 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : explosion ] ) .",
    "this suggests lower temperatures in the cooling layer , less efficient neutrino emission , and therefore an inward shift of the gain radius in 3d compared to 2d : @xmath45 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : explosion ] ) .    consequently , the mass of the gain layer , @xmath46 , is larger and , correspondingly , the mass in the cooling layer , @xmath47 , smaller in 3d .",
    "while the 3d-2d difference of @xmath47 varies with time because the definition of @xmath48 depends on model - specific details , the gain - mass difference grows to @xmath49 between 100ms and 200ms and remains essentially constant afterwards .",
    "the nuclear recombination energy of this mass difference , @xmath50 for @xmath51ergg@xmath26 ( depending on whether free nucleons recombine to @xmath11-particles or iron - group elements ) can easily account for the 3d-2d differences of the explosion energy in fig .",
    "[ fig : explosion ] .",
    "turbulent pressure in the gain layer is understood to be supportive for the onset of neutrino - driven explosions @xcite . however , for our low - mass sn progenitor this effect can not be crucial for the observed 2d-3d difference . despite the faster and more energetic explosion ,",
    "the 3d model exhibits a _",
    "lower _ turbulent kinetic energy in the gain layer during the crucial period 100ms@xmath52ms , visible by the nonradial contribution @xmath53 in fig .",
    "[ fig : explosion ] .",
    "taking into account the larger mass in the gain layer , it means that the nonradial fluid motions are much less vigorous in the 3d case .",
    "in contrast , the nonradial kinetic energy in the cooling layer , @xmath54 , is smaller in the 2d simulation despite the higher mass of this layer in 2d .",
    "this suggests that nonradial motions are much more efficiently damped by dissipation in stronger deceleration shocks and due to symmetry constraints ( reflective axis boundaries ) in the cooling layer of the 2d model .",
    "the reason for more favorable explosion conditions in 3d becomes clearer through radial profiles of the turbulent accretion flow in the gain and cooling layers ( figs .",
    "[ fig : downflows ] and [ fig : vex ] ) . here , angular averages of quantities @xmath28 over infalling matter , i.e. , over regions with radial velocity @xmath55 , are computed according to @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the heaviside function with @xmath58 for @xmath59 and @xmath60 otherwise .",
    "radial velocity profiles of @xmath61 , angle - averaged over convective downdrafts in the postshock accretion layer , exhibit stronger local variations with higher extrema and pronounced intermittency - like behavior in 2d , whereas the angle - averaged infall velocities in the 3d model appear smoother and show less extreme fluctuations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : downflows ] , left ) .",
    "this points to a larger number of smaller - scale convective structures , thus reducing the statistical variance , and suggests less vigorous radial mass motions in the 3d model , which is compatible with the lower nonradial kinetic energy in the gain layer between 100ms and 200ms p.b .",
    "[ fig : explosion ] ) .",
    "this conclusion is supported by cross - sectional cuts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vex ] ) , where narrow convective downflows in 2d possess higher velocities , in agreement with radial profiles of @xmath61 averaged over inflows and time - averaged over 100ms@xmath62ms ( fig .",
    "[ fig : downflows ] ) . the higher infall velocities in 2d in the gain layer and a fair part of the cooling layer",
    "are associated with a greater mass - accretion rate around the gain radius ( fig .",
    "[ fig : downflows ] ) .",
    "moreover , in 2d a larger fraction of the sphere in the gain layer is subtended by downflows , which is expressed by the `` downflow filling factor '' , @xmath63 in fig .",
    "[ fig : downflows ] .",
    "in contrast , in the cooling layer @xmath64 .",
    "all these findings are in line with higher kinetic energies of radial and nonradial flows in the gain layer and slightly lower nonradial kinetic energy in the cooling layer for the 2d model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : explosion ] ) .    at first glance",
    ", the higher mass - accretion rate around @xmath36 in 2d seems to contradict the 2d-3d differences of the flow geometry visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : vex ] : in 2d one counts one or two prominent convective downdrafts , consistent with a convective cell pattern characterized by low spherical - harmonics modes , i.e. , large - scale structures with few downflows .",
    "in contrast , many more downflow funnels exist in 3d , although with smaller infall velocities .",
    "nevertheless , the 2d model channels more mass per time through the gain radius . obviously , the total volume of toroidal `` sheets '' formed by axi - symmetric ( 2d ) downflows is bigger than the volume encompassed by 3d accretion funnels .",
    "exactly this is expressed by the larger @xmath65 in the gain layer , which , together with bigger infall velocities , accounts for the higher mass - accretion rate in 2d .",
    "the reduced rate and less powerful infall of mass through the gain radius is therefore the fundamental reason for more favorable explosion conditions in 3d .",
    "higher downflow velocities in 2d lead to more violent deceleration of the accretion downdrafts in shocks as they penetrate into the cooling layer ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vex ] and the more dramatic decrease of @xmath66 in 2d in fig .",
    "[ fig : downflows ] ) . on the one hand",
    "this causes stronger gravity - wave activity below @xmath36 , which can be recognized by larger angular variations of @xmath61 for the 2d model in this region in fig .",
    "[ fig : vex ] . on the other hand",
    "the impact of downflows dissipates kinetic energy , for which reason the 2d simulation shows a lower kinetic energy of nonradial mass motions in the cooling layer despite its higher nonradial kinetic energy in the heating layer ( fig .  [",
    "fig : explosion ] ) .",
    "more important , however , is the enhanced shock heating of the cooling layer , which leads to higher temperatures in this region in 2d ( fig .",
    "[ fig : downflows ] ) .",
    "estimates confirm that this difference of the angle - averaged temperature of several @xmath8k ( or several percent of the local angle - averaged temperature ) is responsible for the larger net cooling rate of the 2d model just below @xmath36 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : downflows ] ) , because local temperature fluctuations are considerably bigger than the relative differences of the angular averages and neutrino emission rates by @xmath67-captures and @xmath68-pair annihilation scale with @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "consequently , one finds @xmath71 during 170ms@xmath72220ms ( fig .",
    "[ fig : downflows ] , bottom left ) .",
    "since the temperature in the gain layer is only marginally higher in 3d , the net heating rates between @xmath36 and shock are hardly distinguishable for 2d and 3d ( fig .",
    "[ fig : downflows ] , bottom right ) .",
    "the 2d-3d differences in the convective postshock layer , in particular higher downflow velocities and larger mass - infall rate in 2d , can be attributed to well - known differences of 2d and 3d turbulence discussed previously ( e.g. , @xcite ) : turbulent energy cascading leads to fragmentation of large - scale flows to smaller - scale vortices in 3d , whereas the inverse energy cascade in 2d tends to enhance kinetic energy on the largest possible scales .",
    "the turbulent fragmentation ( e.g.through kelvin - helmholtz instability ) of the postshock accretion flow affects the flow characteristics most strongly near the gain radius , for which reason 2d-3d differences of @xmath73 increase as the infalling gas approaches @xmath36 ( fig .  [ fig : downflows ] ) .",
    "because of enhanced turbulent energy in small - scale vortices , the 3d flow becomes less coherent , and turbulent small - scale structures keep mass in the gain layer and reduce @xmath73 , while in 2d the mass - infall rate continues to grow all the way towards @xmath36 .",
    "performing simulations of neutrino - driven explosions for a 9.6@xmath0 star with the prometheus - vertex code in 1d and multi - d , we found significant 2d-3d differences of the accretion flow in the convective postshock layer .",
    "turbulent fragmentation to small - scale vortices keeps more matter in the gain layer in 3d and decreases the rate and velocity of mass accretion into the cooling layer .",
    "this reduces the dissipation of kinetic energy in the cooling region , lowers the temperature there and decreases the energy loss by neutrino emission . the corresponding inward shift of the gain radius leads to an increase of the mass in the gain layer",
    ", whose higher nucleon recombination energy accelerates shock expansion in 3d and boosts the explosion energy by @xmath7410% to @xmath210@xmath3erg with a steeper rise at the beginning of the explosion .",
    "we thus presented the first successful neutrino - driven explosion in a fully self - consistent 3d simulation and , for the first time , identified effects that foster and strengthen neutrino - driven explosions in 3d compared to 2d .",
    "in contrast to the unfavorable influence of 3d turbulence observed in previous studies of more massive stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the decrease of the mass inflow rate through the gain radius and reduced neutrino - energy loss in the cooling layer below @xmath36 have a healthy influence on the explosion in our 9.6@xmath0 progenitor in 3d .",
    "it is difficult to speculate whether these effects could play an important role also for more massive stars , in particular when convection dominates the postshock dynamics @xcite and current numerical resolution deficiencies ( see , e.g. , discussions by @xcite ) have been overcome .",
    "we emphasize that our present grid resolution is insufficient to achieve convergence and to capture fully developed turbulence .",
    "however , we attribute our 2d-3d differences to generic differences of convective downflow dynamics , which are likely to remain valid even for higher resolution . we have identified turbulent fragmentation of 3d flows in the gain layer as helpful for stronger explosions than in 2d , in sharp contrast to disadvantageous consequences of 3d effects for the onset of explosions reported for more massive progenitors in previous works .",
    "higher resolution might even enhance our described effects and their explosion - facilitating consequences rather than endangering them .",
