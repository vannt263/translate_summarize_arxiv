    "one of the ways to study the response of baryons to an external electromagnetic field is through compton scattering , which allows us to extract fundamental response structure parameters , such as polarizabilities , and thus obtain information about the internal degrees of freedom .",
    "electric ( @xmath1 ) and magnetic ( @xmath2 ) polarizabilities enter the effective hamiltonian @xmath3 and the induced electric ( @xmath4 and magnetic @xmath5 dipole moments , respectively , as response coefficients to the electric and magnetic fields .",
    "their values , as well as some insight regarding which internal degrees of freedom of baryons define these values , can certainly shed more light on the internal structure of baryons . for instance , a positive or negative value of the magnetic polarizability already reflects whether a baryon has a paramagnetic or diamagnetic structure , respectively .",
    "the nucleon polarizabilities have been addressed many times in the literature , but their evaluation still remains a challenging task for both theory and experiment .",
    "the world - average experimental values for the nucleon given in @xcite are based on a very broad spectrum of experimental results .",
    "theoretical predictions of the polarizabilities are also have a broad range of values and approaches @xcite .",
    "since we are dealing with low - energy qcd here , we have no choice but rely on phenomenological approaches . in this paper",
    ", we chose an approach based on the effective chiral theory , chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) , where quark - gluon degrees of freedom are replaced by baryon - meson ones .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that it allows us to identify the sources responsible for shaping specific values of the polarizabilities by separately analyzing contributions from the baryon s pion and kaon clouds .",
    "baryon resonance excitations certainly have an impact as well , but since resonances enter into the calculations in the form of rarita - schwinger fields which complicate the calculations tremendously , we leave this for future projects . although polarizabilities enter as the static coefficients in eq.([eq : a1 ] ) , we can expect that the baryon s meson cloud could respond to the external electromagnetic field in a non - linear fashion so polarizabilities can depend on the energy of an incoming photon .",
    "the energy dependence of the dynamical polarizabilities is particularly visible at energies relevant to the various meson production channels .",
    "the main objective of this work is to study the impact of the baryon meson clouds on the electric and magnetic polarizabilities and analyze the energy dependence up to @xmath0 , covering the majority of the meson photo production channels .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we start with a brief outline of the formalism we use to describe the dynamics of the strong interactions , su(3 ) chpt , and our computational hadronic model ( chm ) which allowed us to semi - automatize calculations and thus expand applicability of chpt . the details of the calculations of the compton structure functions are shown in section iii .",
    "numerical results along with the extensive analysis of the dynamical polarizabilities for the entire octet of baryons are shown in section iv .",
    "our findings are summarized in the conclusion ( section v ) .",
    "the lagrangian describing the spontaneous symmetry breaking of @xmath6 due to the pseudo - goldstone scalar bosons into @xmath7 is given by @xmath8.\\label{a00}\\ ] ] which represents the first term of the effective lagrangian from @xcite , the only allowed term with two derivatives .",
    "here , @xmath9 is the pion decay constant and the @xmath10 field is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the pseudo - goldstone boson octet : @xmath13 the covariant derivative is given by@xmath14,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the electromagnetic vector field potential and @xmath16 is the charge operator . the chiral symmetry transformation for the pseudo - goldstone boson field is defined as @xmath17 . to introduce the baryon field into the effective lagrangian uniquely , the new field @xmath18 is defined as @xmath19 . according to @xcite",
    ", the chiral symmetry transformations for the field @xmath18 can be determined in a new basis @xmath20 as @xmath21 the unitary matrix @xmath20 is implicitly defined from eq.([a1 ] ) in terms of @xmath22and @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the chiral transformation for the baryon field is unique , and chosen to be @xmath23 for the effective lagrangian with baryons , this choice of basis is preferable because in this case pions have only derivative - type coupling .",
    "consequently , the effective lagrangian for the baryons can be written in terms of the vector field @xmath24 and the axial - vector field @xmath25 : @xmath26+\\frac{1}{f_{\\pi}^{4}}\\left[p , p\\left(\\partial_{\\mu}p\\right)p\\right]+ ... ,\\nonumber \\\\ \\\\a_{\\mu } & = \\frac{i}{2}\\left(\\xi d_{\\mu}\\xi^{\\dagger}-\\xi^{\\dagger}d_{\\mu}\\xi\\right)=\\frac{1}{f_{\\pi}}\\partial_{\\mu}p+\\frac{1}{f_{\\pi}^{3}}p\\left(\\partial_{\\mu}p\\right)p-\\frac{1}{2f_{\\pi}^{3}}\\left\\ { \\partial_{\\mu}p , p^{2}\\right\\ } .\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] following @xcite , we take the leading - order baryon lagrangian as @xmath27,\\label{a2}\\ ] ] with @xmath28 an @xmath29 octet of baryons given by @xmath30 and the covariant derivative defined as @xmath31.$ ] the strong coupling constants @xmath32 of the lagrangian from eq.([a2 ] ) have been determined in @xcite to be @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the effective chiral perturbation theory of the strong interactions has been quite successful in the description of the hadronic interactions in the non - perturbative regime of qcd .",
    "applying this theory towards compton scattering , we can calculate all the necessary structure functions from the scattering amplitude and then extract the electromagnetic polarizabilities .",
    "however , to extract the polarizabilities successfully , according to the low energy theorem ( let ) , we must include at least next - to - the - leading - order ( nlo ) contributions . to deal with this rather non - trivial problem",
    ", one can either simplify calculations and include only the leading parts of the nlo contribution , or rely on some degree of automatization with computer - based packages . in this work",
    ", we employ the computational hadronic model ( chm ) which allows calculations to be completed up to nlo with the octet of mesons and baryons and the decuplet of resonances participating in the loop calculations .",
    "the renormalization is done using the modified minimal subtraction scheme .",
    "chm extends the feynarts @xcite package , designed for particles of the standard model only , into the hadronic sector , and can be used along with the formcalc , looptools @xcite and form @xcite packages giving results first in analytical and then in numerical form .",
    "a more detailed description of chm can be found in @xcite .",
    "for a baryon without a structure , the compton amplitude is derived from the leading - order ( lo ) perturbation expansion and is represented by the tree - level graphs ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig : compton - tree ] ) ) by :    @xmath35    if we consider a baryon with structure , the spin - independent compton scattering amplitude has the following form @xcite:@xmath36 here , @xmath37 are the polarization vector , frequency and momenta of the incoming photon , respectively .",
    "primed quantities denote the outgoing photon .",
    "the two structure constants @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the electric and magnetic polarizabilities of the baryon , correspondingly .    ]    in order to satisfy the gauge invariance of the electromagnetic current @xmath40 this amplitude is not renormalized , and is expressed through the set of physical observables such as charge and mass . recalling the well - known let , in the thomson limit ( @xmath41 ) , the compton amplitude in eq.([a7 ] )",
    "should take the form of @xmath42 in eq.([a6 ] ) .",
    "hence , when soft photons are considered , the compton scattering is sensitive only to the charge of the baryon and not to the internal structure .",
    "this means that the two structure constants , the electric and magnetic polarizabilities , can be determined only through the nlo loop calculations . a generic set of one - loop diagrams representing types of topologies allowed in compton scattering",
    "is shown in fig.([fig : loop - su2 ] ) .",
    "the full set of graphs includes crossed diagrams and wave function renormalization graphs absorbed into counterterms .    ]    the polarizabilities in eq.([a7 ] ) are normally called static and defined in the limit of zero energy of the incoming photon , @xmath43 .",
    "however , the experiments providing their values were performed in the kinematic region of 55 to 800 mev photons @xcite .",
    "thus , to determine the static polarizabilities by extrapolation to zero energy , one requires additional theoretical information about the energy dependence of the baryon s structure parameters . to construct the energy dependence for the baryon polarizabilities ,",
    "we follow the approach of @xcite which offers an analysis of the dynamical polarizabilities in the energy domain up to the one - pion production threshold . taking into account that polarizabilities in eq.([a7 ] ) now depend on the photon energy",
    ", we can rewrite the nlo compton amplitude using the two energy - dependent structure functions @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "for @xmath46 we have : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the photon s scattering angle in the center of mass reference frame .",
    "multipole expansion for the spin - independent structure functions implemented in @xcite allows us to relate our computer - generated amplitude in the chm to the dynamical electric and magnetic polarizabilities of the baryon .",
    "if we consider only dipole contributions in the multipole expansion of the structure functions , the two compton structure functions of eq.([ca2 ] ) read:@xmath49 here , @xmath50 is the center of mass energy and @xmath51 is the mass of the baryon .    the compton amplitude generated in the chm",
    "is represented using the basis of the dirac spinor chains .",
    "our calculations are spin - independent , and the nlo amplitude takes the form of eq.([ca2 ] ) after traces are taken .",
    "simple extraction of the coefficients in front of @xmath52 and @xmath53 points to the structure functions @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively .    solving the system of eq.[[ca3 ] ] for @xmath54 using the zero momentum transfer approximation ( @xmath55 ) ,",
    "we obtain@xmath56 although the chm does produce analytic expressions for both structure functions , they are extremely lengthy and cumbersome and therefore are excluded from this article .",
    "our results are presented in the form of numerical simulations of the dependencies of @xmath57 on photon energy in the next section .",
    "since experimental results are only available for the nucleon , let us first provide an analysis of the polarizabilities of the neutron and proton .",
    "the world average values for the polarizabilities of the proton and neutron based on a broad spectrum of experimental values are given in @xcite :    @xmath58    theoretical predictions of the polarizabilities also have a broad range of values and approaches ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "for example , @xcite who used the su(2 ) heavy baryon @xmath59 to @xmath60 obtained the following:@xmath61 if we take @xmath62 for the mass of the pion and @xmath63 for the mass of the nucleon and extrapolate central values of the su(3 ) dipole electric and magnetic polarizabilities to the zero photon energy ( see fig.([leading - nlo - chpbth ] ) ) , we obtain:@xmath64        and @xmath34 [ leading - nlo - chpbth],title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath34 [ leading - nlo - chpbth],title=\"fig : \" ]    the uncertainties come from the uncertainties in the strong coupling constants @xmath65 and @xmath66 . within these uncertainties ,",
    "our results are in rather good agreement with the values of @xcite .    according to our calculations",
    ", the electric polarizability clearly shows a resonance - type structure at the pion production threshold , for both proton and neutron ( see fig.([leading - nlo - chpbth ] ) ) . for the proton",
    ", there is a small additional peak at the energy defined by the kaon production threshold .",
    "the magnetic polarizability has a visible change in the slope at the pion production energy .",
    "as expected , all polarizabilities tend to go to zero ( relaxation mechanism ) with the growth of the photon energy .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that as the energy of the photon increases , the nucleon can no longer respond to the high - frequency external electromagnetic field .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]  , title=\"fig : \" ]    as one can see from fig.([nlo - low - energy ] ) , @xmath67 is nearly constant for the energies up to @xmath68 , which means that in that range we can treat the electric polarizabilities as static .",
    "the dependencies given in fig.([nlo - low - energy ] ) for the electric polarizabilities are in agreement with the result of @xcite ( which gives isoscalar values of the polarizabilities defined as an average between proton and neutron polarizabilities ) .",
    "unlike the electric , the magnetic polarizability of the proton shows a relatively strong energy dependence .",
    "@xcite shows similar behavior but our numerical results disagree .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that our calculations are completed in the framework of the chpt model where the next - to - nlo results may contribute .",
    "additionally , we did not include any resonances , and , as was discussed in @xcite , @xmath69 resonance can have a sizable impact on the values of the magnetic polarizabilities .",
    "the detailed studies of the impact of the decuplet of resonances on the baryon polarizabilities will be a subject of our next work .",
    "for now , let us concentrate on finding out which specific degrees of freedom are responsible for such a dynamical behavior of the polarizabilities of the proton .",
    "the idea is to separate contributions coming from the diagrams with neutral pions and etas , charged pions , and kaons , which allows us to determine which of the proton meson clouds gives a dominant and defining contribution into the polarizabilities .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]  , title=\"fig : \" ]    it is evident from fig.([nlo - low - energy - clouds ] ) ( left ) that the charged pion cloud defines the dynamical behavior of the proton electric polarizability , and the neutral pion and kaon clouds do not have any impact .",
    "as for the magnetic polarizability , shown in fig.([nlo - low - energy - clouds ] ) ( right ) , dynamical behavior appears to be defined by the interplay between a relaxation mechanism coming from the neutral pion cloud and a rather strong excitation mechanism from the charged pion cloud .",
    "although the positive value of the magnetic polarizability comes mostly from the neutral pions degree of freedom , the rapid increase of magnetic polarizability with energy is coming from the charged pions .",
    "it is also interesting to observe that for the energy of the photon up to pion production threshold , the neutral pion cloud exhibits paramagnetic properties only . for the charged pion cloud",
    ", we observe diamagnetic behavior up to @xmath68 and a flip into paramagnetic behavior after that .",
    "finally , the impact of the kaon cloud on the overall value of the magnetic polarizability is only static and almost negligible .",
    "we conclude that the dynamics of the pion clouds is most important and requires further analysis in different models .",

    "the baryon magnetic polarizability shows different slope before and after the meson production threshold .",

    ", we find the relaxation mechanism in magnetic polarizability explained by the dominant impact coming from the kaon and neutral pion clouds .",

    ". for the charged pion clouds , magnetic polarizability starts as a diamagnetic type and then flips to paramagnetic behavior at the @xmath93 range of photon energies .",
    "apparently the physics of the dynamical polarizabilities , in addition to resonance excitations , is driven by the dynamics of the separate meson clouds .",
    "experimental studies of these dependencies would help us to understand baryon intrinsic degrees of freedom . from the experiment point of view , the best tool in the studies of the internal baryon dynamics is offered through virtual compton scattering ( vcs ) , which includes polarized - target experiments on nucleons in the forward / backward direction and offers an excellent way to study spin structure parameters of the nucleon .",

    "we believe that with the chm , calculations of the spin - dependent dynamical polarizabilities should be possible in the near future .",
    "although our calculations are done for nlo only , they still generated an interesting set of results for the dynamical polarizabilities .",
