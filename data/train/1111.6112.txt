    "this text is a provisional version of a chapter on macdonald - koornwinder polynomials for volume 5 of the askey - bateman project , entitled `` multivariable special functions '' .",
    "the aim is to introduce nonsymmetric and symmetric macdonald - koornwinder polynomials and to present their basic properties : ( bi-)orthogonality , norm formulas , q - difference(-reflection ) equations , duality and evaluation formulas .",
    "symmetric @xmath0 type macdonald polynomials were introduced by macdonald @xcite as a two - parameter family of orthogonal multivariate polynomials interpolating between the jack polynomials and the hall - littlewood polynomials .",
    "root system generalizations were subsequently defined by macdonald in @xcite .",
    "they were labelled by so called admissible pairs of root systems . recasting these data in terms of affine root systems ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) it is natural to speak of an untwisted theory and a twisted theory of macdonald polynomials associated to root systems .",
    "an important further extension for nonreduced root systems was constructed by koornwinder @xcite . in @xcite important steps",
    "were undertaken to develop a general theory covering all these cases . in this text",
    "we pursue this further .",
    "we call the corresponding polynomials macdonald - koornwinder polynomials .",
    "the symmetric macdonald - koornwinder polynomials are root system generalizations of classical one - variable @xmath1-orthogonal polynomials from the @xmath1-askey scheme @xcite . before giving the contents of this chapter in more detail",
    ", we first illustrate this point of view for the symmetric @xmath0 macdonald polynomials and the symmetric koornwinder polynomials .",
    "the symmetric @xmath2 type macdonald @xcite polynomials form a linear basis of the space of symmetric laurent polynomials in @xmath3 variables @xmath4 , depending on two parameters @xmath5 .",
    "they form an orthogonal basis of the hilbert space @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the normalized haar measure on @xmath8 and with weight function @xmath9 explicitly given by @xmath10 ( the @xmath1-shifted factorial is defined by ) .",
    "in addition , the symmetric @xmath2 type macdonald polynomials are common eigenfunctions of the commuting trigonometric ruijsenaars - macdonald @xcite @xmath1-difference operators @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the @xmath13-vector with @xmath14 s at the entries labelled by @xmath15 and ones elsewhere .",
    "the eigenvalue equation for @xmath16 is equivalent to a homogeneity condition for the symmetric macdonald polynomials . up to a monomial factor",
    "the symmetric @xmath2 macdonald polynomials thus only depend on the @xmath17 variables @xmath18 . for @xmath19",
    "the macdonald polynomials are essentially the continuous @xmath1-ultraspherical polynomials in the variable @xmath20 .",
    "the above results then reduce to the orthogonality relations and the second order @xmath1-difference equation satisfied by the continuous @xmath1-ultraspherical polynomials , see subsection [ gln ] for further details .",
    "the symmetric koornwinder @xcite polynomials form a linear basis of the space of laurent polynomials in @xmath17 variables @xmath21 which are invariant under the hyperoctahedral group ( acting by permutations and inversions of the variables ) , depending on six parameters @xmath22 .",
    "they form an orthogonal basis of the hilbert space @xmath6 with @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "the symmetric koornwinder polynomials are eigenfunctions of koornwinder s @xcite multivariable extension of the askey - wilson @xcite second order @xmath1-difference operator @xmath25 for @xmath19 the @xmath26-dependence drops out and the symmetric koornwinder polynomials are the askey - wilson polynomials from @xcite .",
    "see subsection [ ccheckc ] for further details .",
    "most literature on macdonald - koornwinder polynomials deals with one out of the above mentioned four cases of macdonald - koornwinder type polynomials ( the @xmath0-case , the untwisted case , the twisted case and the koornwinder case ) .",
    "cherednik @xcite treats the first three cases separately .",
    "macdonald s @xcite exposition covers the last three cases , but various steps still need case by case analysis .",
    "we develop the theory in such a way that it naturally unifies the above four cases , but in addition contains a new class of rank two macdonald - koornwinder type polynomials ( see subsection [ except2 ] ) .",
    "the setup will be close to haiman s @xcite approach , which allowed him to give a uniform proof of the duality of the macdonald - koornwinder polynomials .",
    "it is tempting to believe that the initial data for the macdonald - koornwinder polynomials should be similarity classes of irreducible affine root systems @xmath27 together with a choice of a deformation parameter @xmath1 and a multiplicity function ( playing the role of the free parameters in the theory ) .",
    "in such a parametrization the untwisted and twisted cases should relate to the similarity classes of the irreducible reduced affine root systems of untwisted and twisted type respectively , the @xmath0 case to the irreducible reduced affine root system of type @xmath28 with a `` reductive '' extension of the affine weyl group , and the koornwinder case with the nonreduced irreducible affine root system of type @xmath29 ( we refer here to the classification of affine root systems from @xcite , see also the appendix ) .",
    "it turns out though that a more subtle labelling is needed to capture all fundamental properties of the macdonald - koornwinder polynomials .",
    "we take as initial data quintuples @xmath30 with @xmath31 a finite reduced irreducible root system , @xmath32 an ordered basis of @xmath31 , @xmath33 ( @xmath34 stands for untwisted and @xmath35 stands for twisted ) , and @xmath36 , @xmath37 two lattices satisfying appropriate compatibility conditions with respect to the ( co)root lattice of @xmath31 ( see ) .",
    "we build from @xmath38 an irreducible affine root system @xmath27 and an extended affine weyl group @xmath39 .",
    "the extended affine weyl group @xmath39 is simply the semi - direct product group @xmath40 with @xmath41 the weyl group of @xmath31 .",
    "the affine root system @xmath27 is constructed as follows .",
    "we associate to @xmath31 and @xmath42 the reduced irreducible affine root system @xmath43 of type @xmath42 with gradient root system @xmath31 .",
    "then @xmath27 is an irreducible affine root system obtained from @xmath43 by adding @xmath44 if @xmath45 has the property that the pairings of the associated coroot @xmath46 to elements of @xmath36 take value in @xmath47 ( see ) .",
    "the macdonald - koornwinder polynomials associated to @xmath38 are the ones naturally related to @xmath27 in the labelling proposed in the previous paragraph .    in the literature",
    "the terminology macdonald polynomials is used when the underlying affine root system @xmath27 is reduced , while the terminology koornwinder polynomials or macdonald - koornwinder polynomials is used when @xmath27 is nonreduced and of type @xmath29 . in this text",
    "we will use the terminology macdonald - koornwinder polynomials when dealing with arbitrary initial data @xmath38 .",
    "we will speak of macdonald polynomials if the underlying affine root system @xmath27 is reduced and of koornwinder polynomials if @xmath27 is of type @xmath29 .",
    "duality is related to a simple involution on initial data , @xmath48 with @xmath49 the coroot system @xmath50 if @xmath51 and the root system @xmath31 if @xmath52 .",
    "this duality is subtle on the level of affine root systems ( it can for instance happen that the affine root system @xmath53 associated to @xmath54 is reduced while @xmath27 is nonreduced ) .",
    "the reason that the present choice of initial data is convenient is the fact that the duality map @xmath55 on initial data naturally lifts to the duality antiisomorphism of the associated double affine braid group ( see @xcite and section [ 4 ] ) .",
    "this duality antiisomorphism is the key tool to prove duality , evaluation formulas and norm formulas for the macdonald - koornwinder polynomials .",
    "we do not discuss the shift operators for the macdonald - koornwinder polynomials ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , leading to the explicit evaluations of the constant terms ( generalized selberg integrals ) .",
