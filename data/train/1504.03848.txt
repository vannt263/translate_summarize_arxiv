    "<S> we present a resonant x - ray diffraction study of the magnetic order in ndfe@xmath0(bo@xmath0)@xmath1 and its coupling to applied electric fields . </S>",
    "<S> our high - resolution measurements reveal a coexistence of two different magnetic phases , which can be triggered effectively by external electric fields . </S>",
    "<S> more in detail , the volume fraction of the collinear magnetic phase is found to strongly increase at the expense of helically ordered regions when an electric field is applied . </S>",
    "<S> these results confirm that the collinear magnetic phase is responsible for the ferroelectric polarization of ndfe@xmath0(bo@xmath0)@xmath1  and , more importantly , demonstrate that magnetic phase coexistence provides an alternative route towards materials with a strong magnetoelectric response .    </S>",
    "<S> frustrated magnetic materials exhibit a large variety of intriguing physical phenomena , including the concomitant appearance of coupled ferroelectric and magnetic orders@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , interlinked magnetic and ferroelectric orders are very rare in nature . </S>",
    "<S> their discovery in variety of frustrated magnets was therefore a surprise and generated a lot of excitement@xcite , not only because these phenomena are very interesting from the viewpoint of basic research . </S>",
    "<S> there is also a significant technological potential@xcite . especially since a strong magnetoelectric coupling enables to store information in an extremely energy efficient way@xcite </S>",
    "<S> indeed , earlier experiments could demonstrate modifications of a magnetic order related to the reversal of the electric polarization@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these studies , however , were concerned with electric field induced changes within a single magnetic phase or the manipulation of phase stability close to a magnetic transition@xcite .    in the present study </S>",
    "<S> we consider a different situation , where frustrated magnetic interactions cause two distinct ordered states to be metastable well below the observed critical temperatures , even in the absence of any first order transition . as a specific example </S>",
    "<S> , we investigated the electric field dependence of the magnetic order in ndfe@xmath0(bo@xmath0)@xmath1 , which is a frustrated magnetic material with a large magnetoelectric response@xcite . we show that a small perturbation created by an applied _ electric _ field allows controlling the stability of the coexisting collinear and helical _ magnetic _ orders . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that phase coexistence driven by magnetic frustration underlies the magnetoelectric response of ndfe@xmath0(bo@xmath0)@xmath1 , providing an alternative route towards large magnetoelectric effects .    </S>",
    "<S> the rhombohedral lattice structure of this material is illustrated in fig.[fig : struc ] , where , for the sake of simplicity , only the two magnetic sublattices of fe and nd are shown . </S>",
    "<S> these two sublattices are magnetically coupled and undergo two magnetic phase transitions as a function of temperature@xcite : upon cooling , commensurate magnetic ( cm ) order sets in first at @xmath2  @xmath3{k}$ ] . in this phase </S>",
    "<S> the spins are ordered in a collinear fashion , forming ferromagnetic ( fm ) @xmath4-planes , which are coupled antiferromagnetically ( afm ) along the @xmath5-direction . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic modulation vector is commensurate , causing magnetic superlattice peaks at @xmath6= @xmath7 with integer @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> below @xmath9  @xmath10{k}$ ] , a continuous transition into an incommensurate magnetic ( icm ) phase occurs , where the fm moments of the @xmath4-planes form helices propagating along the @xmath5-direction . </S>",
    "<S> the helical order is signaled by magnetic superlattice peaks at @xmath11= @xmath12 , where @xmath13 increases continuously with further cooling due to a dramatically decreasing period of the spin helix ranging from @xmath14 at down to @xmath15 at .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , applying an external magnetic field @xmath16{t}$ ] at @xmath17{k}$ ] along the @xmath18-direction induces an electric polarization @xmath19@xmath20 of up to @xmath21{\\mu c / m^2}$ ] along the same axis@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this strong magnetoelectric coupling sparked significant interest in ndfe@xmath0(bo@xmath0)@xmath1  and immediately raised the question about its microscopic origin . </S>",
    "<S> recent x - ray diffraction experiments already provided microscopic insight and implied that the finite @xmath19@xmath20 is related to the magnetic field - induced cm order@xcite . in principle , the strong magnetoelectric coupling discovered in previous studies should also enable to alter the magnetic order of ndfe@xmath0(bo@xmath0)@xmath1  by applying external electric fields . yet </S>",
    "<S> no experimental studies of this effect have been available up to now . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore performed high - resolution magnetic resonant x - ray diffraction ( rxd ) in applied electric fields in order to close this gap .    </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic rxd has been performed at the resonant scattering beamline of the european synchrotron radiation facility ( esrf ) in grenoble , france ( formerly installed at id20)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a liquid helium orange cryostat equipped with an @xmath22-field stick in - house built by one of us ( c.m.) was mounted on a six circle diffractometer as described in refs . , using an horizontal scattering geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the sample with a thickness of @xmath23{mm}$ ] along the @xmath18-direction was mounted between two vertical electrodes , leaving an additional gap of @xmath24{mm}$ ] between the top electrode and the ndfe@xmath0(bo@xmath0)@xmath1  crystal . by applying a voltage across the two electrodes , electric fields up to @xmath25@xmath26{v / m}$ ]   parallel to the crystallographic @xmath18 axis </S>",
    "<S> were generated . </S>",
    "<S> we set the photon energy to the nd@xmath27  edge at @xmath28{kev}$ ] in order to probe directly the magnetic order of the nd - sublattice , which , in turn , also reflects the magnetic order of the fe - sublattice@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for the @xmath29-scans shown in the following , the incoming light was horizontally ( @xmath30 ) polarized and no polarization analyzer was used .    in fig.[fig : </S>",
    "<S> e - leff ] , @xmath29-scans through the magnetic superlattice reflections measured at @xmath31{k}$ ] are presented . </S>",
    "<S> prior to these measurements the state of the sample was prepared by cooling down to @xmath31{k}$ ] without electric field . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath29-scan obtained for this zero field cooled state is shown in fig.[fig : e - leff](a ) . in agreement with previous results both the ( 0 , 0 , 4.5 ) of the cm phase as well as the icm - satellites at ( 0,0,4.5@xmath32 ) </S>",
    "<S> are observed , revealing the coexistence of the cm minority and the icm majority phase under the present conditions . </S>",
    "<S> it is likely that the observed residual intensity at ( 0 , 0 , 4.5 ) is due to pinned cm - domains that survive deep inside the icm phase . </S>",
    "<S> this observation already indicates that both phases have very similar free energies and that small perturbations suffice to drive the magnetic system from one phase to the other .    </S>",
    "<S> the effect of an electric field on this phase coexistence can be observed in fig.[fig : e - leff](b ) . applying @xmath33 @xmath26{v / m}$ ]  </S>",
    "<S> results in a transfer of intensity from the icm satellites to the central cm - reflection . </S>",
    "<S> the application of the electric field therefore stabilizes the cm - phase and increases its volume fraction at the expense of the icm phase . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion is verified by the fact , that the sum of the scattered intensities from the ic and the cm domains stays constant within 5% . however , the transformation from the icm to the cm phase is not complete within the studied @xmath22-field range , as incommensurate reflections retain a significant intensity . </S>",
    "<S> after the @xmath22-field is switched off , the zero field state is recovered , as demonstrated in fig.[fig : e - leff](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence the effect of the applied @xmath22-field is reversible and our results do not show any significant hysteresis .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath22-field also has a corresponding effect on the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the superlattice reflections , which measures the average correlation length of the cm and icm ordered regions . in detail , the experimental resolution in reciprocal space , as determined using the neighboring ( 0,0,6 ) bragg reflection , is @xmath34 , which is equivalent to a real space resolution of about 760 nm . at 5.8k and @xmath35v / </S>",
    "<S> m the width of the icm - satellites is found to be resolution limited ( fwhm=@xmath34 ) , implying a correlation length @xmath36 nm . </S>",
    "<S> increasing the electric field to @xmath33 @xmath26{v / m}$ ]   causes a clear reduction of @xmath37 to about 476 nm ( fwhm=@xmath38 ) . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , the correlation length of the cm - ordered regions increases with @xmath39 from @xmath40 nm at @xmath35v / m to @xmath41 nm at @xmath33 @xmath26{v / m}$ ]  ( fwhm decreases from @xmath42 to @xmath43 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the comparable values for @xmath44 and @xmath37 again show that phase transformation from icm to cm is not complete at our highest electric field .    </S>",
    "<S> note also that the observed changes as a function of @xmath22 can not be caused by a heating of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> heating would result in a strong change of @xmath13 , which , however , is not observed . </S>",
    "<S> the changes in intensity and fwhm are therefore truly related to a change in the volume fractions occupied by the cm and icm domains . </S>",
    "<S> the stabilization of the cm by an applied electric field further implies that the electric moment of this phase must be larger than that of the icm phase . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the comparison to macroscopic measurements indicates that only cm - phase is ferroelectric while the icm phase does not posses a significant @xmath19@xcite .    from the present experiments it is clear that an applied @xmath22-field has a large effect on the magnetic order of ndfe@xmath0(bo@xmath0)@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the effects observed here indeed go beyond earlier observations@xcite in that the population of two distinct , but coexisting phases is altered by an electric field even far away from a magnetic transition . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the transition between the icm and the cm phases as a function of @xmath22 at constant temperature does not involve the continuous rotation of spins from the helical towards the collinear alignment ( @xmath13 remains constant ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is in stark contrast to the behavior which is observed as a function of temperature in zero applied fields .    </S>",
    "<S> when applying a magnetic field at a fixed temperature , we also find that @xmath13 remains constant , i.e. , in this respect the effect of electric and magnetic fields is the same . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , this observation is surprising and sets the present results apart from previous work : as we demonstrated earlier@xcite , upon field - cooling to a fixed t@xmath45@xmath9 , the value of @xmath13 indeed does change with the magnetic field strength . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that the magnetic state at a given ( b , t)-point in the phase diagram , depends on the path to this this point .    in order to get more microscopic information about the magnetic state under the various studied conditions </S>",
    "<S> , we performed a polarization analysis for circular right ( @xmath46 ) and left ( @xmath47 ) polarized incoming photons by means of so - called stokes scans : for these scans , the polarization of the incoming and the detected photons are both controlled . </S>",
    "<S> the incoming beam polarization was set to @xmath46  or @xmath47  using a diamond phase plate , whereas the polarization of the scattered beam was monitored using a cu220-analyzer . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization state of the incoming radiation , as characterized by the polarization parameters @xmath48@xcite , was @xmath49 and @xmath50 for circular left and circular right , respectively , showing the high degree of circular polarization . during a stokes scan , the polarization of the scattered beam in the plane perpendicular to its direction is measured as a function of the angle @xmath51 , where @xmath52 corresponds to vertical and @xmath53 to horizontal polarization . </S>",
    "<S> we integrated rocking scans of the analyzer crystal at each @xmath51 , to obtain the integrated intensity . </S>",
    "<S> examples and further details of the polarization analysis in magnetic rxd can be found in , e.g. , refs ..    in this way , we investigated four different states : ( i ) the cm phase in zero fields at 20k ( cm - t ) , ( ii ) zero field icm at 5.8k ( icm ) , ( iii ) the cm - phase induced by applied magnetic field ( cm - b ) at 2k and @xmath54 t , as well as ( iv ) the cm - phase induced by applied electric field ( cm - e ) .    the experimental data shown in fig.[fig : magnetic - configs ] was then compared to model calculations , in order to extract information about the microscopic magnetic configuration of the sample . for modelling the magnetic rxd at the afm superlattice positions we used the leading first order term of the spherical harmonic expansion of the scattering tensor , @xmath55@xcite . since the magnetic moments are parallel to the @xmath4-plane@xcite and there is a 3-fold axis along @xmath5 , only one fundamental spectrum of @xmath55 enters , allowing us to apply the usual formalism given in ref .. specifically , we use @xmath56 , with @xmath57 and @xmath58 being the totally antisymmetric 3@xmath59 rank tensor and the magnetic moment direction , respectively . employing these magnetic scattering tensors and the experimental geometry , the structure factor tensors for the different spin - configurations were calculated and compared to experiment . for the cm - t phase </S>",
    "<S> we find that the polarization dependent magnetic rxd can not be described by a mono - domain state . </S>",
    "<S> instead , 3 domains are necessary to reproduce the experimental data ( top row in fig.[fig : magnetic - configs ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> while these measurements do not allow to determine the absolute spin directions of the different magnetic domains , we find that they must be rotated by 120@xmath60 about c with respect to one another . </S>",
    "<S> this is expected because of the 3-fold axis of the unperturbed lattice structure ( neglecting the small ferroelectric distortion ) . </S>",
    "<S> the onset of the icm order is signaled by the appearance of the ic satellites , which exhibit different resonant intensities for @xmath46  and @xmath47  ( second panel from top in fig.[fig : magnetic - configs ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this difference is due to the chirality of the magnetic helix . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , our analysis yields the expected presence of left and right handed domains with volume fractions of 0.70 and 0.30 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the above findings for the cm - t and icm phase are in good agreement with neutron scattering results@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was also shown earlier that a magnetic field of 2 t applied to the cm phase suffices to create a mono - domain cm - b state@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis of the stokes scans yields the same result , using a different and independent method . </S>",
    "<S> the above comparison to previous studies hence verifies our approach and shows that the full polarization control in magnetic rxd provides a powerful means to identify and characterize magnetic multi - domain states .    turning to the cm - e </S>",
    "<S> , we find that 3 magnetic domains with a relative angle of 120@xmath60 are necessary to model the experimental data , very similar to the case of the cm - t state described above . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore find that our maximum electric field of @xmath26{v / m}$ ] does not create a mono - domain state with collinear magnetic order along one single direction . </S>",
    "<S> instead still different types of domains are found to exist . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to the mono - domain cm - b state described above .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> the key result of the present work is the observation of a delicate balance between two distinct magnetic phases , which reacts very sensitively to an applied electric field . </S>",
    "<S> more in detail , the present magnetic rxd experiments reveal a complex microscopic state , where the coexisting cm- and icm - regions also realize different domain - types , namely three 120@xmath60 cm- and two left / right handed icm - domains . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to point out that frustrated magnetic couplings result in the competition of the cm and icm order@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , this frustration also underlies the magnetic phase coexistence reported here , which occurs even deep inside the icm phase and in the absence of a first order transition . triggering the magnetic phase coexistence in frustrated materials by electric fields </S>",
    "<S> therefore provides an alternative route towards new materials with a large magnetoelectric response . </S>"
