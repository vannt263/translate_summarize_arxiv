    "the model of hot big bang cosmology has impressive successes such as explaining the light nucleosynthesis and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation . despite its considerable successes , it suffers from central problems such as the flatness problem , the horizon problem and also the magnetic monopole problem .",
    "inflation theory was proposed to solve all of these problems @xcite .",
    "inflation is not a replacement for the hot big bang cosmology , but rather an extra add - on idea which supposes that a short period of rapid accelerated expansion has occurred before the radiation dominated era .",
    "in addition to solving the problems of the hot big bang cosmology , inflation can provide a reasonable explanation for the anisotropy observed in the cmb radiation and also in the large - scale structure ( lss ) of the universe @xcite .",
    "this fact makes it possible for us to contact the late time observations to the early stages of our universe .",
    "important observational results are provided by the planck satellite from probing of the cmb radiation anisotropies in both temperature and polarization @xcite . using these observational results",
    ", we can distinguish viable inflationary models and also constrain them .",
    "the standard inflationary scenario is based on a canonical scalar field in the framework of einstein gravity .",
    "viability of different inflationary models in the framework of standard inflationary scenario in light of the observational results has been extensively investigated in the literature @xcite .",
    "so far , many inflationary models have been proposed .",
    "one important class of inflationary models are based on the extended theories of gravity .",
    "the well - known instance for this class of models is the starobinsky @xmath0 inflation @xcite . despite the fact that this model is the first inflationary model ,",
    "it is in well agreement with the observational results @xcite .",
    "inflationary models on the extended theories of gravity have been extensively studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "one important branch of the extended theories of gravity is the scalar - tensor gravity which is a general theory that includes the @xmath1-gravity , the brans - dicke gravity and the dilatonic gravity @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on the brans - dicke gravity and study inflation in this framework .    in study of inflation , the scalar field",
    "is called `` inflaton '' that can provide a negative pressure needed to have an accelerated expansion . during inflation ,",
    "the inflaton rolls slowly downward a potential and we can examine its evolution classically @xcite . at the end of inflation ,",
    "the inflaton begins to oscillate around the minimum of the potential that leads to particle production and provides for the universe to transit into the radiation dominated era .",
    "this period is known as the `` reheating '' process that its details are unknown to us so far . also",
    ", we do nt know the shape of the inflationary potential that determines the dynamics of the inflaton . in order to understand the inflationary potential , we need more advances in both theory and observations",
    ". however , by examination of different potentials in light of the observational results , we can specify some features of the original inflationary potential . in order to relate the present time observations to the inflationary era",
    ", we note that besides the classical evolution , the inflaton scalar field has some quantum fluctuations during inflation that can lead to the primordial perturbations whose we can see the imprints on the anisotropies observed in the cmb radiation and in the lss formation @xcite .    note that from the energy scale of the primordial universe , it is believed that cosmological inflation has occurred in the regime of high energy physics .",
    "also in one hand , the effective quantum field theory predicts that the high energy theory has fields with non - canonical kinetic terms @xcite . on the other hand , from the action of the brans - dicke gravity , we know that the kinetic term of this theory has a non - canonical form .",
    "this motivates us to investigate the cosmic inflation of the early universe within the framework of the brans - dicke gravity . in our work",
    ", we concentrate on the various inflationary potentials which have motivations from quantum field theory or string theory and check their viability in light of the planck 2015 observational results .",
    "to do so , first we present a brief review on the scalar - tensor gravity that it will be done in sec . [",

    "[ sec : bd ] , we will apply the results of sec . [",

    "at first , in 1950 , jordan applied a scalar field in the gravitational part of the action .",
    "then , in 1961 , brans and dicke @xcite introduced a formalism for gravity in which the metric field together with a scalar field have been invoked to describe the gravitational force .",
    "after the discovery of the present accelerated expansion of the universe in 1998 , other models on the base of the scalar - tensor gravity were proposed to explain this phenomenon @xcite . in this class of models ,",
    "a scalar field is considered to solve the cosmological constant problems .",
