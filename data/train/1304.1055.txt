    "fractional calculus modelling has recently had different developments in the applied science @xcite .",
    "the caputo derivative of real order introduces a memory formalism as it is an integro - differential operator defined by the convolution of the ordinary derivative with a power law kernel . in this note",
    "we propose an analysis of the propagation of a small density perturbation through a compressible fluid using techniques related to fractional calculus . in practice",
    "we replace the ordinary time derivative with the caputo fractional derivative in the constitutive equations aiming at furnishing the model with a memory .",
    "this approach leads to a coupled system of fractional differential equations that has to be properly treated .    from a physical point of view",
    ", this means introducing a memory formalism in a simple model of sound propagation through a one - dimensional compressible fluid . by means of this model",
    "we can take into account a time delay in the wave propagation .",
    "similar fractional generalisations in modelling sound propagation were already considered in some papers .",
    "for instance in some recent works , fellah et al .",
    "@xcite studied transient - wave propagation in porous materials using fractional modelling to take into account the frequency variability of some dynamic cofficients of the medium like tortuosity and compressibility .",
    "their approach is also validated by experimental observations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have also to notice that tarasov @xcite gave a space - fractional formulation of the hydrodynamic equations to describe fluid flow in fractal media .",
    "he also studied sound wave propagation within this conceptual framework . in our formulation",
    "we use a time - fractional generalisation of the characteristic master equations ; therefore our model is in some way similar to the one of fellah et al .",
    "@xcite concerning propagation in porous media , but more general , as we are going to discuss . as a matter of fact",
    "we want to show that by using our approach , with some specific hypotheses on the range of variability of the fractional order of differentiation , a fractional diffusion - wave equation will result by decoupling the constitutive equations .",
    "this result appears interesting because we obtain a family of equations , depending on the real order of differentiation , which includes the heat equation as a particular case .",
    "we find thus that , by introducing fractional derivatives in the constitutive equations of a one - dimensional compressible fluid , we embrace a vast phenomenology , including subdiffusive and superdiffusive processes .",
    "moreover , with our mathematical hypotesis , processes like classical diffusions , can be considered as special cases of a more general and complex phenomenology that can be treated with fractional calculus .",
    "this means that in some physical problems , a diffusive equation corresponds to a microscopic fractional process of migrating fluid particles with memory . from a mathematical point of view",
    ", we study different cases : when the semigroup property is valid for the caputo fractional derivative , we derive a fractional diffusion equation by decoupling the related system of equations ; otherwise we obtain partial differential equations with fractional sequential derivatives .",
    "the organisation of this paper is the following : in section [ doc ] we recall some basic concepts and properties related to fractional calculus ; in section [ doc2 ] , our model of propagation of a small perturbation with time fractional derivative is discussed ; in section [ doc3 ] we provide a mathematical discussion on the range of variation of the characteristic indices of differentiation ; section [ stapler ] concerns the solution of initial value problems involving fractional sequential derivatives .",
    "this is particularly important as they arise naturally for some values of the characteristic indices of fractionality ; finally , in section [ doc5 ] we give a complete discussion of the results in relation to the previous research on generalised sound propagation models .",
    "in this section we recall some definitions and basic results related to fractional calculus .",
    "let @xmath0 . the riemann ",
    "liouville fractional integral is defined as @xmath1    note that this operator is such that @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , it satisfies the semigroup property , i.e. @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "different definitions of fractional derivatives have been introduced and studied in the literature ( see for example @xcite ot @xcite ) . for the sake of our analysis and because it proved to be of practical application , we make use of the caputo fractional derivative .    [ caputo ] let @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , the caputo fractional derivative is defined by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the ordinary derivative of integer order m.    it is clear by definition [ caputo ] that the fractional derivative is a pseudo - differential operator given by the convolution of the ordinary derivative with a power law kernel . therefore the reason why fractional derivatives introduce a memory formalism becomes evident .",
    "it is simple to prove the following properties of fractional derivatives and integrals ( see e.g.  @xcite ) : @xmath10    finally , a key point for the following discussion is the limit of validity of the semigroup property for the caputo fractional derivative . in its recent book , diethelm ( see @xcite , pag.56 ) gave a sufficient condition for the validity of the semigroup property for the caputo fractional derivative .",
    "let us recall it .",
    "[ semi ] let @xmath11 $ ] , for some @xmath12 and some @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , let @xmath14 be such that there exists some @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "then @xmath18    the proof of this theorem is very simple .",
    "it proceeds by considering the definition of the caputo derivative in relation to the riemann ",
    "liouville fractional integral .",
    "this theorem highlights a constraint on the applicability of the semigroup both with respect to the request of smoothness of the function and with respect to the ranges of the real orders of differentiation @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "this means , for example , that , if @xmath21 $ ] , then the law of exponents is applicable if @xmath22 and @xmath23 , with @xmath24 .",
    "here we have also to notice that in most cases the law of exponents is not applicable for fractional caputo derivatives , but anyhow there are different techniques to handle sequential fractional derivatives ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear that in cases where the semigroup is still valid for the caputo derivative , the fractional equations are more manageable and , what is most important , the construction of a cauchy problem demands conditions with meaningful physical sense . in the following discussion",
    "therefore , we develop our analysis in the cases in which the semigroup property is valid , neglecting the analysis of the fractional sequential case for which the requested initial conditions have not a clear physical interpretation .",
    "let us consider a one - dimensional compressible fluid , initially at rest , with an homogeneous constant density @xmath25 .",
    "we study the effect of a small perturbation in the density @xmath26 .",
    "we thus deal with a perturbative theory with @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the velocity field and where @xmath26 and @xmath29 are first order terms .",
    "this is a simple way to obtain the sound wave propagation equation in a compressible fluid .",
    "we will develop this classical model replacing the ordinary derivative with the fractional caputo derivative .",
    "the equations of continuity and velocity of the fluid , linearised at the first order , are    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the sound velocity in the fluid .",
    "this is a coupled linear system of fractional equations .",
    "note that we have used the symbol @xmath32 for the caputo fractional partial derivative and in general the real order @xmath19 and @xmath20 can be different . in the following",
    "we discuss the range of variability of the fractional orders in @xmath33 .",
    "now , applying the fractional derivative of order @xmath20 to the first equation , and differentiating the second equation with respect to @xmath34 , we obtain    @xmath35    and finally @xmath36 in general this is a partial differential equation with a time fractional sequential derivative ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we are interested in the cases in which the law of exponents ( theorem [ semi ] ) is satisfied and the equation therefore becomes @xmath37 i.e.  a fractional diffusion - wave equation ( when @xmath38 $ ] ) , extensively studied in literature ( see for example @xcite for the fundamental solution ) .",
    "in fact we wish to arrive at a meaningful equation that can be treated considering initial conditions with physical meaning , differently from the case usually treated with fractional sequential derivatives . in the next section",
    "we thus discuss the cases in which this coupled system leads to a single fractional diffusion - wave equation .",
    "note also that with a symmetric manipulation we find the following equation for the velocity field @xmath29 : @xmath39",
    "in the previous section , we showed that our coupled system of fractional equations on velocity and density fields of a one - dimensional compressible fluid , is related to the fractional diffusion - wave equation , under the hypothesis that the semigroup property holds . here",
    "we discuss in detail the cases in which we can apply the law of exponents .",
    "this section is devoted to mathematical analysis ; we will return to physical meaning in the last section .",
    "we first consider equation with the constraints @xmath40,\\ ] ] i.e. the pair of parameters @xmath41 varies in region @xmath42 shown in fig .  [ tione3 ] .",
    "note that the constraints are equivalent to @xmath43 .",

    "[ tione3 ] ) .",
    "we are now going to study the possibility of arriving at a fractional diffusion equation displaying a superdiffusive behaviour . in this case , in order to maintain at least partially the semigroup property , we consider the following constraints for the fractional indices @xmath19 and @xmath20 : @xmath47 .          \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in fig .",
    "[ tione3 ] the region @xmath48 of the @xmath49-plane in which hold is shown .",
    "equation is easily retrieved .",
    "clearly , in this case @xmath50 $ ] thus furnishing the system with a superdiffusive regime .",
    "furthermore the related coupled fractional system is where hold .",
    "[ samsung ] if conditions hold , the equation related to the velocity field arising from can be determined as @xmath51 here the semigroup property is no longer valid .",
    "considerations similar to those in remark [ samsung ] in the case of @xmath52 ,              \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] lead to the following results .",
    "the semigroup validity region is pictured in fig .",
    "[ tione3 ] , region @xmath53 . in this case",
    "we obtain @xmath54 and @xmath55    the four characteristic regions in the @xmath56-plane . ]    concluding we note that the cases for which the semigroup holds , are not exactly a generalisation of the classical case ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 )",
    ". however we will give in the last section a physical interpretation of these equations in relation to the original framework , i.e.  equations of velocity and mass conservation of one - dimensional compressible fluid .",
    "here we remark that solutions to both uncoupled equations and ( or the related and ) can be determined by first solving the subdiffusion type equation and then by arriving at a solution of the sequential derivative type equation by means of the relations of the coupled system .",
    "indeed we have for example that the solution to the cauchy problem @xmath59 is well - known and reads @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the wright function @xcite . in turn , with the initial condition @xmath62 , we can write @xmath63",
    "in this section we present a possible way of addressing the problem of solving cauchy problems involving sequential fractional derivatives .",
    "we consider the region of the @xmath49-plane defined by the constraint @xmath64 ( see fig .",
    "[ tione3 ] ) .",
    "we seek to solve the following initial value problem : @xmath65 we underline that we have requested specific initial conditions involving fractional derivatives",
    ". this choice will be clear in the following discussion .",
    "here we recall that this kind of initial conditions has not a broadly accepted physical meaning , but some suggestions on its interpretation are already present in the literature ( see @xcite ) . in this section",
    "however , we are more interested in outlining a possible way to solve partial differential equations with fractional sequential equations more than in defining a precise physical meaning .    in order to solve , we consider an auxiliary function @xmath66 , solution to @xmath67 by means of and",
    ", we can construct the coupled system @xmath68 with the initial conditions @xmath69 and @xmath70 . notice that functions @xmath71 and @xmath72 are linked together . indeed",
    "from we have that @xmath73 by inserting the initial condition of into we immediately obtain @xmath74 similarly , from , @xmath75 considering and we arrive at @xmath76    summarising , the coupled cauchy problems becomes @xmath77 @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "now , the application of the fourier transform @xmath80 to leads to @xmath81 in turn , by passing to the laplace transform @xmath82 we have @xmath83 by substitution we can write that @xmath84 we now make use of the following laplace transform : ( see @xcite , formula ( 2.2.26 ) ) @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the mittag  leffler function . therefore , by inverting the laplace transform we obtain @xmath87 the inversion of the fourier transform is now only a matter of an application of relations ( 14.7 ) and ( 14.8 ) , page 27 of @xcite which leads to an explicit formula involving fox functions .",

    "shows also that the semigroup property is satisfied .",
    "we note that in the case @xmath93 ( or correspondingly , @xmath94 ) , i.e. when the problems @xmath95 and @xmath96 are taken into consideration , a reasoning similar to that of this section , leads to the same solution for @xmath97 and to the solution to the well - known fractional diffusion - wave equation for function @xmath66 , as it should be .",
    "here we discuss the main result of this paper : finding diffusive processes from the fractional generalisation of density and velocity equations of a simple one - dimensional compressible fluid .    from a physical point of view",
    "we tried to understand the consequence of using a wide generalisation of the constitutive equations on sound wave propagation in order to take into account memory effects . in this way",
    "we want to show that fractional calculus proves to be a useful analytic tool to describe a general class of phenomena beyond classical memoryless processes .",
    "moreover , our aim is to build a complete theoretical framework to justify the empirical modification of the wave equation discussed in literature . regarding this , for example , we recall the recent paper of @xcite that relates non - integer power law absorption of sound waves to fractional equations ; they justify the modification of the wave equation starting from the constitutive equations rather than considering empirical modifications due to observed attenuation and dispersion power laws .",
    "we also suggest an interpretation within the framework of fluid mechanics , recalling some relevant recent results on fractional modelling in this field . in their work fellah",
    "@xcite suggested the following constitutive equations of acoustic waves propagations in porous media :      where @xmath99 is the bulkmodulus of air , @xmath100 is the porosity , @xmath101 the density , @xmath102 is the acoustic pressure , @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the dynamic tortuosity and compressibility of the air ; clearly the symbol @xmath89 denotes the time convolution @xmath105 we refer to the original paper for an analysis of the physical model .",
    "what is most relevant is that they used fractional calculus to take into account time variability of @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the convolution with dynamical coefficients clearly implies a physical global delay in the signal propagation and the presence of memory .",
    "also the experimental variability of dynamical coefficients suggests to use the time - fractional derivative in place of the convolution considered in . this fractional model for acoustic wave propagation",
    "was also experimentally validated in @xcite . in this framework",
    "our model can be simply adapted .",
    "in fact , following @xcite , can be written as a coupled system of fractional equations on pressure and velocity fields in a one - dimensional model .",
    "the indices related to the order of differentiation are free parameters to be fit by means of experimental findings on the variability of the characteristic coefficients in the medium of propagation .",
    "furthermore there is no need to assume @xmath108 in our constitutive equations .",
    "fractional calculus in this case emerges as a natural formalism from the formulation used in @xcite .",
    "this allows us to have a family of flexible processes through which we can deal in a general way with many different physical situations depending on the properties of the media of propagation .",
    "finally , considering the results biefly reviewed here , we understand that fractional wave equations are relevant in cases of propagation in media characterised by power law frequency - dependent physical coefficients .    from a mathematical point of view , we find two interesting results .",
    "first of all , when the semigroup property holds for the caputo derivative , from the constitutive equations of the model we obtain diffusive or subdiffusive behaviours . hence we can infer anomalous diffusive processes from fractional models of fluid such as that in .",
    "on the other hand , we find a way to solve partial differential equations with fractional sequential derivatives based on analysing the related coupled system of equations ."
