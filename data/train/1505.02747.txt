    "at the present time the problem of quantization is mathematically well defined only for free fields . despite its successes , a perturbative ( p ) quantization has its own problems : ( a ) renormalization is not mathematically well - defined procedure ( in this regard feynman said that it is just sweeping the garbage under the rug ) ; ( b ) series constructed from feynman diagrams are only asymptotic series , which , strictly speaking , are not convergent series .    perturbative quantum field theory is based on the notion of interacting point particles . in this case a mathematical tool for describing the interaction of particles are feynman diagrams .",
    "they describe point particles that interact at the vertices ( points in spacetime ) and move between these interaction acts as free particles .",
    "this description can be used only for small coupling constants and leads to such a problem as the problem of renormalization . from the physical point of view",
    "this problem is explained as follows : the propagator of free particles is a distribution , and in describing loops the product of distributions is appeared which is badly defined from the mathematical point of view .",
    "fortunately , the renormalization procedure of physical quantities leads to finite results .",
    "r. feynman , one of founders of perturbative calculations , called this procedure `` sweeping the garbage under the rug . ''",
    "the renormalization procedure divides all theories into two classes : renormalizable and non - renormalizable ones . in this regard ,",
    "we note the following : when we work with feynman diagrams , physically it means that we use the concept of a particle , and vice versa , if we introduce the notion of quantum particles we have to use feynman diagrams .",
    "that is , we have a one - to - one correspondence between feynman diagrams and particles  quanta .",
    "here we must clearly understand that if we can not use the concept of quantum particles , we can not draw feynman diagrams , that is true in reverse too : if we can not draw feynman diagrams , we can not introduce the concept of quantum particles .",
    "this observation forces us to conclude that in nonperturbative ( np ) quantum field theory ( where one can not use feynman diagrams ) , we can not introduce the concept of quanta .",
    "another interesting feature in np quantum field theory is that there is no any renormalization procedure because the renormalization occurs only when we use feynman diagrams",
    ". an important consequence of this observation is that the non - renormalizable theories can be quantized at the nonperturbative level .",
    "the results of p calculations are also in conflict with gravity .",
    "the problem is that in performing p calculations one inevitably deals with zero - point quantum vacuum fluctuations with nonzero energy which , according to general relativity , are sources of a gravitational field .",
    "computation of these corrections gives rise to the appearance of a cosmological constant whose value exceeds its real value by many orders of magnitude . from the physical point of view the appearance of this energy",
    "is related to the fact that an interacting particle moves between interactions as a free particle , and a free particle in quantum field theory is an oscillator having the nonzero lowest energy value .",
    "this energy should give rise to the cosmological constant but , as mentioned above , the value calculated by using p calculations is not consistent with the one measured in astrophysical observations .",
    "the first np quantum calculations were made by w. heisenberg , see ref .",
    "he applied the np quantization method for quantizing a nonlinear spinor field .",
    "the physical motivation for his calculations was the attempt to obtain the physical theory of an electron .",
    "heisenberg s calculations allowed to evaluate some properties of an electron with some accuracy .",
    "before we proceed to a mathematical basis of np quantization , let us discuss the physical grounds of np quantum physics .",
    "we established in the introduction that a np quantum field is not a cloud of quanta . before starting the mathematical description of quantization procedure",
    ", it would be very useful to discuss the physical essence of a np quantum field . in our opinion",
    "a strongly interacting quantum field ( that must be quantized using a np quantization procedure ) is similar to a turbulent fluid . at any point",
    "we have a fluctuating field which is analogous to velocity , pressure , and so on for a turbulent fluid .",
    "green s functions of np quantum fields outside of a light cone are nonzero , in contrast to p  quantized fields .",
    "the reason is that for strongly interacting fields localized regular objects may exist .",
    "for example , such objects do exist in classical theories : non - abelian monopoles and instantons , solitons , etc .",
    "it is possible to expect the existence of such objects in quantum theory of nonlinear strongly interacting fields . in this case",
    "the correlation of quantum fields at two spatially separated points will be nonzero .",
    "now we can start the mathematical description of the procedure of np quantization .",
    "first , we want to describe briefly this approach :    1 .",
    "[ st1 ] we write down field equations where all physical quantities are written with hats , i.e. , for quantum field operators .",
    "[ st2 ] we write down the expectation value of these equations . 3 .   [ st3 ]",
    "we see that the equations couple various green s functions . for example",
    ", we have @xmath0 and @xmath1 in one equation .",
    "[ st4 ] we multiply an initial field equation by some combination of field operators to get the equation for the desired green s function .",
    "for example , multiplying the equation for @xmath2 by @xmath3 , we obtain the equation with @xmath4 .",
    "[ st5 ] after the quantum averaging we get an equation for unknown green s function .",
    "for example , we obtain the equation for @xmath1 .",
    "[ st6 ] again we see that the new equation contains a new green s function . for example",
    ", it will be @xmath5 .",
    "we repeat [ st4 ] - [ st6 ] once again , and so on _ ad infinitum_.    when we write down operator field equations it is not clear how we can work with the operator equations ?",
    "how we can describe the properties of this operator ? in the p quantization scheme , after the quantum averaging , the operator equation for a free field gives us the equation for the propagator .",
    "this equation can be solved , since it is a linear equation . as mentioned above , in our case",
    "the situation is different : as a consequence of nonlinearity , we have to write an infinite set of equations for all green s functions .",
    "we think that the properties of the field operator are described by all green s functions .",
    "this means that the operator equation is equivalent to a set of equations for all possible green s functions .",
    "simultaneously , all green s functions give us full information about the quantum state @xmath6 . here",
    "we use @xmath6 for the quantum averaging , @xmath7 .",
    "finally , we want to say that in practice we can not solve directly the field operator equations . instead of this",
    ", we have to solve the infinite set of coupled equations for all green s functions . in doing so",
    ", we see the next problem : how such infinite set of equations can be solved ?",
    "we think that the only possibility is to cut off the infinite set of equations to obtain a finite system of equations by using some physical assumptions about higher - order green s functions .",
    "similar procedure is well known in modeling turbulence ( see , for example , the textbook of wilcox  @xcite ) .",
    "the situation there is as follows ( we follow ref .",
    "@xcite in this paragraph ) : one can write a statistically averaged version of the navier - stokes equation ( the reynolds - averaged navier - stokes equation ) for an averaged velocity . this equation contains six new unknown functions @xmath8 ( the reynolds - stress tensor , where the overbar denotes statistical averaging ) .",
    "this means that our system is not yet closed . in quest of additional equations",
    ", we have to take moments of the navier - stokes equation .",
    "that is , we multiply the navier - stokes equation by a suitable quantity and statistically average the product . using this procedure",
    ", we can derive a differential equation for the reynolds - stress tensor .",
    "after such procedure we gained six new equations , one for each independent components of the reynolds - stress tensor .",
    "however , we have also generated 22 new unknown functions : @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "this situation illustrates the closure problem of turbulence modeling ( let us note that we have the similar problem for a nonperturbative quantization ) .",
    "because of the nonlinearity of the navier - stokes equation , as we have higher and higher moments , we generate additional unknown functions at each level . as written in ref .",
    "@xcite : `` the function of turbulence modeling is to derive approximations for the unknown correlations in terms of flow properties that are known so that a sufficient number of equations exists . in making such approximations , we close the system . ''",
    "following this scheme , we can rephrase the last sentence as applied to a nonperturbative quantization : _ the approximate approach for a nonperturbative quantization being suggested here is to derive approximations for unknown green s functions using the properties of the quantum system under consideration so that a sufficient number of equations exists . in making such approximations",
    ", we close an infinite set of equations for the green s functions . _    after that point , we want to say that a np quantized field has similar properties to a turbulent fluid : ( a ) at every point we have fluctuating quantity(ies ) ; ( b ) the np quantum field(s ) can not be presented as a cloud of quanta ; ( c ) the correlation between spatially separated points is nonzero .",
    "in this section we follow ref .",
    "according to [ st1 ] , we write the operator field equation @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the operator of the lagrangian density ; @xmath14 is the operator of the field ; the index @xmath15 encodes all possible indices in one .",
    "this equation is the key equation for the np quantization .",
    "according to [ st1]-[st6 ] , we have to obtain equations for all green s functions using this master equation .",
    "it is evident that this receipt works for free fields .",
    "applying the aforementioned receipt for a free field , we obtain the propagator and all higher - order green s functions as polylinear combinations of propagators .",
    "the first example : the operator yang - mills equation is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the field strength operator ; @xmath18 is the gauge potential operator ; @xmath19 are the su(3 ) color indices ; @xmath20 is the coupling constant ; @xmath21 are the structure constants for the su(3 ) gauge group ; @xmath22 is the current operator .    the second example : in gravitation theory , we have the operator einstein equation @xmath23 where all geometrical quantities are defined in the usual manner from the corresponding operators : @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the energy - momentum tensor operator .",
    "heisenberg s technique offers to use an infinite set of equations for all green s functions , which can be written as follows @xmath26",
    "it is believed within the np quantization scheme for strongly interacting fields that an interaction happens always and everywhere . on the other hand ,",
    "the p quantization scheme for weakly interacting fields assumes that the fields are free almost always and everywhere , except vertices where the interactions happen . in this sense",
    "the p quantization procedure is contradictory : we use lagrangian for free fields almost always and everywhere and only at the vertices we use full lagrangian with interacting terms .",
    "the movement of point particle in p scheme leads to the renormalization procedure .",
    "this procedure occurs by calculating of loops .",
    "the problem is that in a loop we have the product of propagators of free particles .",
    "propagators are distributions and consequently their product is not well defined mathematical procedure .",
    "we need to use the renormalization procedure to obtain physically meaningful result .",
    "we think that the renormalization procedure will not appear in np scheme .",
    "but it does not mean that in this case the life will be easier .",
    "we will have much more complicated problems : cutting off an infinite equations set for all green functions , closure problem and so on .",
    "in this section we want to compare the procedure of np quantization with turbulence modeling . in principle , the time - dependent , three - dimensional navier - stokes equation contains all of the physics of a given turbulent flow ( in this section we follow the textbook  @xcite ) @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the flow velocity , @xmath29 is the fluid density , @xmath30 is the pressure , @xmath31 is the viscous stress tensor , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is molecular viscosity .    because turbulence consists of random fluctuations of the various flow properties , a statistical approach for turbulence modeling",
    "is used . for a complete statistical description of the hydrodynamic fields of a turbulent flow",
    "it is required to have all the multidimensional joint probability distribution for the values of these characteristics in spacetime .",
    "but the definition of multivariate distributions is a very complex problem , in addition , these distributions are themselves often inconvenient for applications due to its awkwardness . therefore , in practice one can form the time average of the continuity and navier - stokes equations .",
    "the nonlinearity of the navier - stokes equation leads to the appearance of momentum fluxes that act as apparent stresses throughout the flow .",
    "after that it is necessary to derive equations for these stresses and the resulting equations include additional unknown quantities .",
    "this illustrates the issue of closure , i.e. , establishing a sufficient number of equations for all of the unknown cumulants ( moments ) .",
    "one can introduce the instantaneous velocity , @xmath34 , as the sum of a mean , @xmath35 , and a fluctuating part , @xmath36 , so that @xmath37 equation is usually referred to as the reynolds - averaged navier - stokes equation .",
    "the quantity @xmath38 is known as the reynolds - stress tensor and denoted as @xmath39 immediately we see that we have additionally six unknown quantities @xmath40 as a result of reynolds averaging .",
    "it is necessary to note that we have gained no additional equations . for general three - dimensional flows",
    ", we have four unknown mean - flow properties : pressure @xmath30 and the three velocity components @xmath28 .    along with the six reynolds - stress components",
    ", we thus have ten unknown quantities .",
    "our equations are mass conservation and the three components of equation .",
    "this means that our mathematical description of a turbulent flow is not yet closed . to close the system",
    ", we must find enough equations to solve for our unknowns .      to obtain additional equations",
    ", we can take moments of the navier - stokes equation .",
    "that is , we multiply the navier - stokes equation by a fluctuating property and average the product . using this procedure , we can derive , for example , a differential equation for the reynolds - stress tensor .",
    "one can obtain the following equation for the reynolds stress tensor @xmath41 where @xmath42 we have obtained six new equations , one for each independent component of the reynolds - stress tensor @xmath40 .",
    "however , we have also generated 22 new unknowns @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "it illustrates the closure problem of turbulence .",
    "because of the nonlinearity of the navier - stokes equation , as we take higher and higher moments , we generate additional unknowns at each level .",
    "the function of turbulence modeling is to devise approximations for the unknown correlations in terms of flow properties that are known so that a sufficient number of equations exists . in making such approximations ,",
    "we close the system .",
    "there exist a few approaches to close this infinite set of equations .",
    "some of them are : algebraic ( zero - equation ) models , one - equation models , two - equation models , and second - order closure models .      in this subsection",
    "we want to take a look over the procedure of cutting off in turbulence modeling .",
    "the simplest of turbulence models is an algebraic model .",
    "this model uses the so - called boussinesq eddy - viscosity approximation for computing the reynolds stress tensor as the product of an eddy viscosity and the mean strain - rate tensor .",
    "often the eddy viscosity , in turn , is computed in terms of a mixing length . according to the textbook @xcite , @xmath47 where the eddy viscosity @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 with prandtl s empirical mixing length , @xmath50 .",
    "let us note that it allows one to cut off an infinite system of equations to one equation .      in this approach a transport equation is considered .",
    "the equation is obtained from by tracing it @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the deviation of pressure from the averaged value , and the specific turbulence kinetic energy @xmath53 is defined as @xmath54 the dissipation per unit mass @xmath55 is defined as @xmath56 the conventional approach to close of @xmath53 equation consists in replacing unknown correlations with closure approximations .",
    "reynolds stress tensor @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the mean strain - rate tensor .",
    "the standard approximation of a turbulent transport of scalar quantities in a turbulent flow is that of gradient - diffusion . in our case",
    "it is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a closure coefficient .    to complete equation , prandtl postulated the following form for the dissipation , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a closure coefficient and the turbulence scale length remains the only indefinite parameter in this model .",
    "thus , combining equations and , the one - equation model appears as @xmath63 .",
    "\\label{4c2 - 70}\\ ] ]      the starting point for two - equation models is the boussinesq approximation and the turbulence kinetic energy equation .",
    "kolmogorov pointed out  @xcite that a second transport equation is needed to compute the specific dissipation rate , @xmath64 .",
    "there are many two - equation models .",
    "for example , we consider the @xmath65 model .",
    "kolmogorov postulated  @xcite the following equation for @xmath64 , @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are two new closure coefficients .",
    "finally , we have two equations for a turbulent fluid : @xmath69 , \\label{4d2 - 20}\\\\    \\rho \\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial t } +      \\rho u_i \\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial x_i } & = &    \\alpha \\frac{\\omega}{k } \\tau_{ij } \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_j }      - \\beta \\rho \\omega^2 +    \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j } \\left [          \\left (        \\mu + \\sigma \\mu_t      \\right ) \\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial x_j }      \\right ] , \\label{4d2 - 30}\\\\    \\mu_t & = & \\frac{\\rho k}{\\omega } , \\label{4d2 - 40}\\\\    \\epsilon & = & \\beta^ * \\omega k , \\ ;    l_{mix } = \\frac{k^{1/2}}{\\omega } , \\label{4d2 - 50}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where is the turbulence kinetic energy equation ; is the specific dissipation rate equation ; is the eddy viscosity ; @xmath70 are closure coefficients ; are auxiliary relations .",
    "it is necessary to note that there are many other two - equation models ( see the textbook  @xcite for details ) .",
    "it is important for us that in such a case      as we have seen from the above discussion , the cutoff of infinite sets of equations in turbulence modeling is performed by using physical assumptions about higher order cumulants and by introducing closure coefficients .",
    "it is written in ref .",
    "@xcite :    this statement can be directly transferred to a np quantization procedure by replacing the word `` turbulence '' by `` quantum '' .      in this section",
    "we want to discuss the connection between turbulence and quantum chromodynamics ( for details , see ref .",

    "the character of a fluid flow depends on the reynolds number @xmath71 @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the fluid density , @xmath74 is the fluid velocity , @xmath75 is the characteristic length for a given flow , and @xmath33 is the fluid viscosity . if @xmath76 then the flow is the laminar one , if @xmath77  the turbulent one .",

    "a nonperturbative quantization for @xmath81 is an open question .",
    "possible connection between hydrodynamics and quantum field theory based on a comparison between the reynolds number ( in hydrodynamics ) and a dimensionless coupling constant ( in quantum field theory ) is proposed in ref .",

    "@xmath91 : a turbulent fluid corresponds to a nonperturbative regime of quantum field theory .",
    "in this section we want to give examples how a np quantization can be applied in certain cases .      here",
    "we consider a few cases of np quantization as applied to gravity .",
    "we recall that a np quantization for gravity is the operator einstein equation @xmath92 in this subsection we want to consider a physical system where the quantum metric @xmath93 can be decomposed into two parts : the classical metric @xmath94 and the quantum metric @xmath95 ( here we follow ref .",

    "we use some physically reasonable assumptions about the expectation value @xmath101 , @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the proportionality coefficient ( closure coefficient in the language of turbulence modeling ) . with such assumptions about the expectation value of the quantum part @xmath95 of the metric @xmath104",
    "the lagrangian takes the form @xmath105    in such a physical system quantum corrections for matter are also appear .",
    "for example , the scalar field lagrangian changes as follows : @xmath106 , \\label{app - gr-80}\\ ] ] where @xmath107 is the energy - momentum tensor .      in the previous subsection [ parta ] we have considered an approximate decomposition of the quantum metric where , in the first approximation , the metric operator is decomposed into the classical part and the quantum part with zero expectation value .",

    "we want to show that in a gravitating physical system a situation may occur where a fluctuating torsion gives rise to the appearance of a cosmological constant and euclidezation of spacetime ( here we follow ref .",

    "the reason for this is that nonperturbative quantum gravitational effects are taken into account .      in this section",
    "we want to consider a few examples of applying np quantization ideas for quantum chromodynamics .",
    "a glueball is a hypothetical composite particle that consists solely of non - abelian su(3 ) gauge field , without valence quarks .",
    "the existence of a glueball is a consequence of the self - interaction of gluons within quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",

    "it is natural that the fields in such configurations are not zero everywhere . in this regard",
    "the following question makes a physical sense : whether do exist in quantum field theories somewhat similar solutions , but where a quantum average from all fields are equal to zero while the dispersion of the fields are nonzero ?",
    "if such objects would exist , it would be very strange field configurations : it would be possible to tell that it is the objects created from vacuum as quantum averages from all fields are equal to zero , but quantum averages from dispersions of the fields are not equal to zero .",
    "it is possible that such object is a glueball as it has no quarks , so there are no sources for gluon fields and therefore it is possible to assume that the gluon field in it has a zero expectation value but a nonzero expectation value of squares of the fields .",
    "it is especially interesting if such objects would exist in the gravity interacting with some fields , and special interest would be represented by a situation when such object does not exist without gravitational forces .",

    "vacuum is defined using annihilation operator @xmath201 as @xmath202 this definition explicitly uses the notion of quantum and consequently can not be used for the definition of np vacuum .",
    "physically the difference between p and np vacuums is in the following : the p vacuum is a sea of virtual quanta that appear and annihilate everywhere and always ; the np vacuum is a sea of fluctuating fields that fluctuate around a zero expectation value and the sea in a np case is not a cloud of quanta .",
    "np vacuum can have unusual properties . in ref .",
    "@xcite possible properties of np vacuum are discussed and a scalar field with log - potential for an effective description of np vacuum is introduced .",
    "one well known bad property of a p vacuum is that it has infinite energy as a consequence of the presence of zero - point fluctuations .",
    "this property leads to an incorrect value of the @xmath203-term in gravity .",
    "np quantization can give us an interesting interpretation of string theory .",

    "physical interpretation of such a situation is that there is a string which swept a sheet which is the 4-point green s function and all nonzero green s functions can be interpreted as the interaction of strings .    in the path integral",
    "language the quantization is the fourier transformation @xmath207 = \\int d \\phi_a e^{i \\left (      s\\left[\\phi_a\\right ] + j^a \\phi_a    \\right)}. \\label{string-10}\\ ] ] here @xmath208 $ ] is the generating functional ; @xmath209 $ ] is the action for the field @xmath210 ; @xmath15 is an generalized index ; @xmath211 is the source field .",

    "thus : ( a ) in such interpretation a @xcite ; ( b ) quantization of quantum object brings us back to the original classical theory .",
    "in this situation , it is not surprising that the initial classical theory has unusual properties .",
    "in particular , it exists only in a multidimensional space .",
    "we have considered a np quantization  la heisenberg @xcite .",
    "calculations within the np quantization are much more difficult than those within a p quantization scheme .",
    "the truth is that in the first case we have to find physical arguments to cut off an infinite set of equations , but in the second case only one problem exists  the renormalization of loops .",
    "this is a usual situation : linear problems are always solved much more simpler than the nonlinear ones .",
    "this can be demonstrated schematically as follows : @xmath215 np quantization procedure can be schematically written as @xmath216 let us briefly list the main features of np quantization :    * np quantization can in principle be applied for any theory .",
    "it does not depend on the renormalizability of given field theory : * green s functions are much softer on the light cone .",
    "the reason is that np theories may have regular compact objects . in such objects",
    "quantum correlations between space separated points should be nonzero .",
    "* there are common mathematical features between a np quantization and turbulence modeling : in both cases , we have an infinite system of equations for green s functions / cumulants . * for solving an infinite set of equations for all green s functions",
    "the use of some physical arguments is absolutely necessary to cut off the infinite set of equations to a finite system of equations . * _ closure problem _ :",
    "appearance of some problems associated with the cutoff procedure is not excluded . * the properties of field operators and quantum state of a given physical system",
