    "in recent years low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies have received an increasing amount of attention . with the advent of deep",
    ", large - field surveys many of these galaxies have been discovered , both in clusters and in the field ( schombert et al .",
    "1988 , 1992 [ hereafter sbsm ] , turner et al .",
    "1993 , davies et al .",
    "1994 , schwartzenberg et al .",
    "1995 , sprayberry et al .",
    "1995a ) .    the main property which distinguishes lsb galaxies from normal `` classical '' galaxies that define the hubble sequence is their low surface brightness ( @xmath4 ) and not their size .",
    "lsb galaxies are not necessarily dwarfs .",
    "many of them are disk galaxies that typically have scale lengths of several kpc , ( mcgaugh & bothun 1994 , de blok et al .",
    "1995 [ hereafter bhb95 ] ) i.e. , in the same size range as typical high surface brightness ( hsb ) galaxies .",
    "the faintest lsb disk galaxies hitherto discovered have central surface brightnesses of @xmath5 mag arcsec@xmath6 ( turner et al .",
    "1993 ; irwin et al . 1990",
    "; davies , phillips & disney 1988 ) .",
    "this is almost two orders of magnitude fainter than those of the disk galaxies that obey freeman s law ( 1970 ) , which states that most disk galaxies have a central @xmath7-band surface brightness in the range @xmath8 mag arcsec@xmath6 .",
    "the existence of lsb galaxies with central surface brightnesses deviating many @xmath9 from the freeman value indicates that this law is not a complete description of the central surface brightness distribution of disk galaxies .",
    "attempts to construct the proper distribution from extant data ( mcgaugh , bothun & schombert 1995 , mcgaugh 1996 ) suggest that lsb galaxies are numerically common , though considerable uncertainty remains .",
    "de jong ( 1995 , 1996 ) investigated the central surface brightness distribution of spiral galaxies for a range of hubble types .",
    "he concluded , on the basis of a diameter - limited , statistically complete sample of 86 face - on spiral galaxies from the ugc ( including a few lsb galaxies ) , that freeman s law should be restated as that there is no preferred single value for the central surface brightness of disks in galaxies , but only an upper limit in surface brightness which galaxies can have ( corresponding approximately to the freeman value ) ( see also allen & shu , 1979 ) . towards later types the central surface brightness systematically decreases .",
    "in general the range of properties exhibited by lsb galaxies is much larger than that of the classical freeman galaxies . the sizes and luminosities of lsb galaxies range from the very small and faint dwarfs like gr8 ( hodge 1967 ) , to the giant and luminous lsb galaxy malin 1 ( impey & bothun 1989 , sprayberry et al .",
    "lsb galaxies _ in general _ are therefore likely to be not so much a single group , different from all other types of galaxies , but rather the dim counterparts of the known `` classical '' galaxies .",
    "we have drawn our sample from the list of lsb galaxies by sbsm .",
    "the sbsm list was made by scanning by eye selected fields of the new poss - ii survey , and applying the ugc diameter selection criteria to the objects discovered .",
    "the increased depth of these new plates resulted in the discovery of many lsb galaxies that would have been in the ugc had it been compiled at present using the poss - ii plates .",
    "sbsm make no claims about completeness in their survey , but rather that `` our purpose ... is simply to increase our known sample of lsb galaxies and to offset the clear bias in apparent magnitude catalogs for the discovery of only hsb systems . ''",
    "the present paper is written in this spirit",
    ".    with this in mind it is striking that lsb galaxy surveys that have concentrated on detecting field lsb galaxies ( like e.g. sbsm ) have in general found that the large majority of the galaxies ( @xmath10 85% in the case of sbsm ) in these surveys are late - type spirals .",
    "ellipticals and early - type spiral galaxies form only a small minority . in our work",
    "we will therefore restrict ourselves to describing the properties of a subset of lsb galaxies : those of the late - type lsb disk galaxies . in the rest of the paper when we refer to lsb galaxies",
    "we will always implicitly mean this sub - group , unless noted otherwise .",
    "not included are dwarf ellipticals and spheroids , like those found in the local group .",
    "the group of late - type lsb galaxies is in many ways an extension of the hubble - type sequence towards very late types .",
    "they continue ( and are in many cases the most extreme representatives known of ) the trends defined by the hsb galaxies along the hubble sequence towards lower surface brightnesses .",
    "such trends are increasingly bluer colours ( bhb95 , mcgaugh & bothun 1994 [ hereafter mb94 ] , rnnback 1993 ) , decreasing oxygen abundances in the gas ( mcgaugh 1994 , rnnback & bergvall 1995 ) , and decreasing hi surface densities ( van der hulst et al.1993 [ hereafter vdh93 ] ) .",
    "a detailed investigation of these late - type lsb disk galaxies will therefore provide an insight into systematic changes of properties of spiral galaxies along the hubble sequence as an explicit function of surface brightness .",
    "one particular example of the trends with surface brightness was presented in zwaan et al ( 1995 ) ( cf .",
    "romanishin et al .",
    "it was shown that late - type lsb disk galaxies also lie on the tully - fisher relation ( see also sprayberry et al .",
    "1995b ) , requiring a systematic and fine - tuned relation between the surface brightness of a galaxy and its overall mass - to - light ratio .",
    "in order to hope to understand this systematic relation , and perhaps to uncover other relations important to our understanding of galaxy properties and their history , resolved hi imaging , providing detailed rotation curves , is required .",
    "we have obtained such hi imaging data for 19 lsb galaxies with the vla and wsrt synthesis radio telescopes . in this paper",
    "we present the data and a global analysis . in forthcoming papers",
    "we will present a full decomposition of the rotation curves into disc and halo components , and , in combination with optical properties , discuss the processes that regulate the rate of evolution and star formation in these dim galaxies .    in section 2",
    "we discuss the sample selection .",
    "section 3 contains technical details on the observations . in section 4",
    "we discuss the reduction of the data . in section 5 the derivation of parameters from these data",
    "are given . in section 6",
    "we present the data in tabular and graphical form .",
    "section  7 contains a discussion of the hi surface densities . in section  8",
    "the rotation curves are discussed .",
    "section 9 is devoted to the mass - to - light ratios , and finally in section 10 the main points of this paper are summarized .",
    "we present 21-cm hi synthesis radio observations of a sample of 19 lsb galaxies , taken from the catalogues of lsb galaxies by sbsm .",
    "the sbsm catalogue is not dominated by small , faded dwarf galaxies .",
    "lsb galaxies occupy the full range of types as defined by the hubble sequence , however with a strong preference towards later types .",
    "the redshift distribution is similar to those of the ugc galaxies , with only small deviations at the low and high velocity tails , where the lsb survey picks up lsb dwarfs , and lsb giants respectively .",
    "the spatial distribution shows that lsb galaxies are good tracers of the large - scale structure on scales of @xmath11 mpc ( cf .",
    "bothun et al .",
    "1993 ; mo , mcgaugh & bothun 1994 ) .",
    "they do not fill the voids .",
    "the same applies to the distribution of hi masses : apart from a slightly smaller mean for the lsb galaxies , they are similar .",
    "the large fraction of lsb galaxies that has been detected in hi shows that these galaxies are just as likely to contain hi as their hsb counterparts of similar hubble - type .",
    "we refer to sbsm for a complete discussion of the properties of the galaxies in their catalogue .",
    "the typical lsb galaxy , as listed in sbsm , is therefore a late - type spiral galaxy in our local universe , with luminosity and hi mass not significantly different from late types already present in the ugc , but typically more extreme in surface brightness .    in order to select a number of representative galaxies from the sbsm catalogue ,",
    "we have applied the following criteria .    1 .",
    "the galaxy should have been detected in hi .",
    "this necessarily limits the sample to the 171 galaxies that have been observed with arecibo , but as explained in sbsm this does not bias the sample towards objects containing much hi , as the success rate of detections for these galaxies was at least 80% ( and would have been higher if not for the limits imposed by the observable velocity range ) .",
    "2 .   as the hi masses of galaxies in sbsm are strongly peaked around @xmath12 with a spread of 0.5 dex to both sides ( cf . fig . 5 in sbsm ) , we have selected only galaxies with hi masses in the range @xmath13 .",
    "this leaves 132 galaxies .",
    "3 .   in order not to confuse true dwarfs with lsb disk galaxies",
    "we have furthermore restricted the sample to those galaxies with redshifts between 3000 and 8000 km s@xmath1 , which sbsm define as `` lsb disks '' ( cf .",
    "their fig .",
    "this leaves 95 galaxies .",
    "4 .   from this sample of 95 galaxies , we selected 16 galaxies at random .",
    "this subsample represents in our opinion a typical cross - section of the larger sample of late - type lsb disk galaxies .",
    "the sample is listed in tables 13 .    in order to compare the properties of these lsb galaxies with those of dwarf lsb galaxies and large lsb galaxies , we further supplemented the sample with examples of these two classes .",
    "the dwarf sample consists of 3 galaxies with hi masses smaller than @xmath14 @xmath15 and redshifts smaller than 3000 km s@xmath1 .",
    "these are f564-v3 , f571-v2 and f583 - 1 .",
    "we used the sample of vdh93 to represent the large lsb galaxies . although their hi masses are slightly larger , they set themselves apart from our main lsb sample mostly because of their larger optical scale lengths , and because of the fact that despite their low central surface brightness , they were included in the ugc catalogue .",
    "although our sample is not complete in a statistical sense , we have obtained a sample of galaxies which is representative of the late - type lsb disk galaxies found in the sbsm catalogue .",
    "we can use this sample to extend the range in surface brightness over which properties of disk galaxies are investigated towards lower surface brightnesses .    it should also be noted that , to the best of our knowledge , no hi - rotation curves of galaxies with central surface brightnesses fainter than 23.5 @xmath7-mag arcsec@xmath6 ( the average surface brightness of our sample ) have been published . there are only a handful of rotation curves available in the literature of lsb dwarfs ( @xmath16 ) , most of them ddo dwarfs ( carignan & beaulieu 1988 , hoffman et al .",
    "this is surprising , given the fact that these galaxies are dark - matter dominated , providing ideal cases for the study of the dynamics and density distributions of the dark matter .",
    "the discussion on whether halos are isothermal or singular ( see flores & primack 1994 ) depends very much on evidence provided by this same handful of rotation curves .",
    "the sample presented here thus greatly extends the available data on galaxies in this still ill - charted lsb area of parameter space .",
    "this is currently the largest sample of lsb galaxies for which detailed optical , radio and abundance data are available ( vdh93 , mcgaugh 1994 , mb94 , bhb95 ) .",
    "we observed 19 lsb galaxies in the 21-cm hi line .",
    "observations of 10 galaxies were performed with the vla in its 3-km ( c ) configuration using two if systems , 27 antennas and 64 channels over a 3.125 mhz bandwidth .",
    "the spectra were hanning - smoothed on - line providing a velocity resolution of 20.6 km s@xmath1 .",
    "each galaxy was observed for 5 times 40 minutes interspersed with 5 minute observations of a phase calibrator . for bandpass calibration and the flux density scale we observed 3c286 with the same correlator settings as each galaxy .",
    "the observations were performed on 10 , 16 , 17 and 21 december 1990 .",
    "further details are given in table  1 .",
    "the other 9 galaxies were observed with the wsrt .",
    "each galaxy was observed for 12 hours with 38 baselines ranging from 72 m to 2736 m with 72 m increments . both if systems were used and the correlator was set up to provide 64 channels over a bandwidth of 2.5 mhz .",
    "no on - line spectral smoothing was performed , so the highest possible velocity resolution is 9.9 km s@xmath1 .",
    "off - line hanning smoothing reduces the velocity resolution to 16.5 km s@xmath1 .",
    "amplitude / phase and bandpass calibration was performed using observations of 3c147 and 3c286 .",
    "the observations were done in june and september 1990 and may and august 1991 .",
