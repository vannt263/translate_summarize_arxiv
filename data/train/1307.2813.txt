    "the splitting between 0th and 1st ll s ( @xmath20 ) becomes larger than @xmath23 .",

    "although @xmath25 agrees with eq . 2 for @xmath12 = 0.028 and 0.035 above 15 k , @xmath25 exhibits a sudden and large increase below 15 k , deviating from eq . 2 at low temperatures .",
    "since the gradient of @xmath25 was determined by @xmath23 and @xmath24 , this low @xmath5 deviation is tied to a change in @xmath23 and @xmath24 within the framework of eq .",

    "mn substitution was found to increase the carrier number of the dirac cone , but @xmath24 remained nearly constant .",
    "it therefore appears that although the mn substitution changed the energy level of the dirac neutral point , it did not change the total carrier number due to the compensation between the parabolic bands and the dirac cones .",
    "we conclude from this that the linear dispersion of dirac cone is not disturbed by mn substitution . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath25 showed an immediate increase below 15 k for @xmath12 = 0.028 and 0.035 .",
    "this suggests that @xmath23 increases and @xmath24 decreases below 15 k. for the dirac cone , the cyclotron effective mass ( @xmath3 ) can be calculated using eq . 3 @xcite . because @xmath3 is described by these two parameters , the increase in @xmath19 may indicate a decrease in mobility ( @xmath10 ) as described by eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) . in order to confirm the above scenario",
    ", we estimated the mobility based on a two - carrier - type semiclassical approximation in the low @xmath16 limit @xcite . at this limit ,",

    "one additional constraint is necessary .",
    "it was reported by angle - resolved photo emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) that the luttinger volumes of both electron and hole fermi surfaces are comparable to each other in ba(feas)@xmath2 @xcite and that the mn substitution does not result in additional carriers @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can approximate the system as a semimetal , that is , @xmath33 = @xmath34 .",
    "we then systematically solve @xmath11 , @xmath14 and @xmath11@xmath18 using eqs .",
    "( 1)-(3 ) , where @xmath14 and @xmath11@xmath18 are quadratic and linear against @xmath16 , respectively .    for ba(feas)@xmath2",
    ", it has been theorized that the fermi surface under the sdw ordered state is composed of four pockets @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , the transport parameters in each pocket of the four carrier system can be merged into @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 within a two carrier model @xcite .",
    "we thus use the averaged mobility ( @xmath37 = ( @xmath10@xmath38 + @xmath10@xmath39)/2 ) to evaluate the dependence of mobility on the carrier number of the dirac cones .    figure 3(g ) shows the carrier mobility @xmath37 estimated in this way . below @xmath40 , @xmath37 continuously increased with decreasing @xmath5 for @xmath12 = 0 - 0.016 . it is noted that @xmath37 for @xmath12 = 0.028 and 0.035 saturate around 10 k , before decreasing at lower @xmath5s .",
    "the decrease in @xmath37 below 10k for @xmath12 = 0.028 and 0.035 is qualitatively consistent with the @xmath5 dependence of @xmath19 described by the abrikosov model @xcite .",
    "it was reported that artificial defects act as local magnetic impurities in graphene , leading to the kondo behavior @xcite .",
    "iron pnictides may exhibit a similar behavior , since magnetic impurity scattering does not break the dirac cone states due to the pseudospin chiral symmetry @xcite . as such , one might propose that the kondo effect emerges between the dirac fermions and the localized 3@xmath4-electron spins arising from the mn impurities .",
    "in fact , previous studies have recently reported the kondo effect in iron pnictides , supporting the realisity of the present assumption @xcite . in order to search for the behaviors which characterize the kondo effect",
    ", we studied the @xmath5 dependence of @xmath11 ( normalized as @xmath11/@xmath11@xmath41 ) for @xmath12 = 0.007 - 0.035 , as shown in fig.4(a ) . under the sdw",
    "states where the dirac cone forms , the normalized resistivity ( @xmath11/@xmath11@xmath41 ) shows a local minima ( @xmath11@xmath42 ) before increasing again when @xmath5 is lowered further @xcite .",
    "similar data was published by thaler et al.@xcite , but their discussion focused mainly on the differences between mn- and co- substitutions from the viewpoint of supercoductivity . in order to study the behavior of @xmath11/@xmath11@xmath41 at low @xmath5",

    "intriguingly , @xmath43@xmath11 increases logarithmically as t decreases , saturating in the low @xmath5 limit .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the picture of the kondo effect for a system consisting of dilute magnetic impurities and conduction electrons .",
    "moreover , the @xmath5 dependence of the magnetic susceptibility ( @xmath44 ) for @xmath12 = 0.035 deviates from the curie - law below 30 k as shown in the inset of fig.4 ( b ) and shoes saturation at low-@xmath5 .",
    "this is consistent with quasiparticle mass enhancement via the kondo effect .        in a kondo system with conduction electrons and localized electrons ( @xmath45 = 1/2 ) , the kondo singlet forms as the ground state , leading to an increase in @xmath3 @xcite . since the present @xmath19 was directly tied to the quantum behavior of the dirac cone , and @xmath37 is likewise influenced by the dirac cone in the rapidly quenched ba(feas)@xmath2 series @xcite , the present observations , showing that @xmath19 increases and @xmath37 decreases , can be associated with a kondo - like mass enhancement of the dirac fermions in ba(fe@xmath0mn@xmath1as)@xmath2 under the abrikosov model @xcite(fig .",
    "1(b ) ) . recently , in order to explain lmr in iron pnictides , koshelev theoretically investigated the realization of lmr under the nodal - sdw state @xcite . in his theory , koshelev notes out that @xmath19 is proportional to both the sdw gap and the inverse of the quasiparticle scattering rate , resulting in a nonmonotonic @xmath5 dependence of @xmath19 .",
    "however , @xmath25@xmath46@xmath5 has been experimentally confirmed in ba(feas)@xmath2 systems within a wide @xmath5 range @xcite , which is likewise consistent with lmr in the dirac cone @xcite . in the present work we also observe an increase in @xmath19 in the @xmath43@xmath11 saturation region below 10 k for @xmath12 = 0.028 and 0.035 samples , in disagreement with the model proposed by koshelev . it should be noted that the kondo temperature may be high ( @xmath47 20 - 30 k ) considering the @xmath5 dependence of @xmath43@xmath11 shown in fig.4(b ) , while the kondo screening can be efficiently suppressed by the fe 3d electron ordering in iron pnictides @xcite . since an anomolously high kondo temperature ( @xmath47 100 k )",
    "has also been reported in graphene @xcite , the nature of the kondo effect between the dirac fermions and the localized 3d electrons of mn provides an interesting point for scientific debate .    in order to evaluate the enhancement of @xmath3 for the dirac fermions in greater detail ,",
    "1/@xmath37 was plotted versus the square root of the dirac cone carrier number ( @xmath48 ) , as shown in fig.4(c ) .",
    "given that @xmath49 could not vary below @xmath40 it was estimated using eq.3 , from the values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 shown in fig.2(d ) . for comparison , the dependence of @xmath48 on 1/@xmath37 is also shown for ba(fe@xmath0ru@xmath1as)@xmath2 .",
    "we can easily recognize a remarkable contrast between the linear evolution of 1/@xmath37 observed for ba(fe@xmath0ru@xmath1as)@xmath2 and the positive deviation seen in ba(fe@xmath0mn@xmath1as)@xmath2 .",
    "the former has been consistently explained in terms of the dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath49 in the dirac cone @xcite .",
    "given the invariant @xmath49 of the dirac cone for ba(fe@xmath0mn@xmath1as)@xmath2 , @xmath3 at the lowest temperature of 2 k was evaluated using eqs.2 and 3 .",
