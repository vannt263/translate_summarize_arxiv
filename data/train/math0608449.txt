    "let @xmath2 be a planar , strongly - connected finite simplicial complex .",
    "the set of piecewise polynomial functions on @xmath2 of smoothness @xmath1 has the structure of a module @xmath7 over the polynomial ring @xmath8 $ ] ; the subset of @xmath9 such that @xmath10 is of degree at most @xmath0 for each two - simplex @xmath11 is a finite dimensional real vector - space , denoted @xmath12 . in @xcite , for almost all triangulations , alfeld and schumaker give a formula for the dimension of the @xmath12 in terms of combinatorial and local geometric data ( data depending only on local geometry at the interior vertices of @xmath2 ) , as long as @xmath13 . in @xcite , it was conjectured that their formula actually holds as long as @xmath5.the purpose of this brief note is to show that this conjecture is optimal ; in particular we exhibit a planar simplicial complex @xmath2 such that for _ any _ @xmath1 there exist `` special '' splines in degree @xmath6 . in other words ,",
    "the conjecture of @xcite is tight .",
    "the methods we use depend on the homological approach developed by billera in @xcite to answer a conjecture of strang .",
    "this approach was further developed by schenck and stillman in the papers @xcite , @xcite , using a chain complex different from billera s and some additonal technical tools ( local cohomology and duality ) .",
    "when @xmath2 is a planar simplicial complex , it turns out that the delicate geometry of the problem is captured by a certain local cohomology module , which as shown in @xcite has a simple description ( see below ) .",
    "for example , the geometry of the famous `` morgan - scott '' example , which shows that even for @xmath14 the formula of @xcite does not apply for @xmath15 , is captured by this local cohomology . for more results on the morgan - scott triangulation",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , and for computations of the dimension for small triangulations see @xcite . in the next section",
    "we quickly review the presentation of this module ; then we exhibit a specific @xmath2 and prove that for any @xmath1 , the dimension of this module ( which exactly captures the discrepancy between alfeld - schumaker s formula and the actual dimension ) is nonzero in degree @xmath6 .",
    "by taking the cone @xmath16 over @xmath2 , we turn the problem of computing @xmath17 into a problem in commutative algebra - compute the hilbert function @xmath18 . as shown in @xcite , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the alfeld - schumaker formula and @xmath21 is a graded @xmath22 $ ] module of finite length .",
    "lemma 3.8 of @xcite contains the following description : @xmath21 is the quotient of a free module generated by the totally interior edges ( those edges with no vertex @xmath23 ) , modulo the syzygies at each interior vertex .",
    "the generators of @xmath21 are shifted so that they have degree @xmath24 .",
    "this description seems cumbersome , but as we ll see in the example below , it is fairly easy to work with .",
    "so in the terms above , the conjecture of @xcite is that @xmath21 vanishes in degree @xmath25 .",
    "our goal is to show that this bound is the best possible , so we want to find a configuration @xmath2 such that for all @xmath1 , @xmath26 .",
    "consider the following simplicial complex ( see also @xcite )    to find @xmath21 , we begin by determining the minimal free resolutions for the ideals @xmath27 for @xmath28 and @xmath29 the interior vertices .",
    "we have : @xmath30 @xmath31 these ideals are in @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "notice that @xmath32 is the linear form vanishing on the totally interior edge . with the change of variables given by the matrix @xmath33\\ ] ]",

    "in what follows we will prove that the hilbert function of @xmath38 is nonzero in degree @xmath39 , for any positive integer @xmath1 .",
    "in other words @xmath40",
    "in the previous section we saw that the ideals @xmath41 and @xmath42 have a special form .",
    "first notice that they are symmetric ( in terms of the generators ) in @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "so replacing @xmath43 by @xmath44 in the forms of @xmath45 and @xmath46 we obtain @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "next observe that we can look at the ideal @xmath41 as an ideal in @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "similarly , @xmath42 is an ideal @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "hence @xmath51 and @xmath52 .    for @xmath53 ,",
    "the ideal @xmath54 is a complete intersection .",
    "for example , if @xmath55 is not a complete intersection , since @xmath56 and @xmath57 , then @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , there is a nonunit in @xmath59 , say @xmath60 , such that @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "hence @xmath65 . but",
    "this contradicts the fact that @xmath66 , as @xmath67 is a regular @xmath59-sequence .",
    "so the ideal @xmath55 is a complete intersection .",
    "the same argument shows that @xmath68 is also a complete intersection .",
    "let @xmath49 $ ] and @xmath70 .",
    "by @xcite , theorem 3.1 , a free resolution for @xmath41 is : .2 in @xmath71 } } { \\longrightarrow } a(-2n)^3   \\stackrel{\\tiny { \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } x^{2n}\\ , ( x+y)^{2n}\\ , y^{2n } \\end{array } \\right ] } } { \\longrightarrow }   i_1 \\longrightarrow 0 $ ] , .2 in where @xmath72 . from the observations at the beginning of this section we get the minimal free resolution for @xmath73 : @xmath74 therefore the hilbert series is @xmath75 .",
    "hence there exists a monomial @xmath76 of degree @xmath77 which is not in @xmath78 .",
    "in fact , with an easy computation we can see that this monomial is actually @xmath79 .",

    "@xmath78 is a complete intersection so the minimal free resolution for @xmath73 is : @xmath96 therefore the hilbert series is @xmath97 .",
    "hence there exists a monomial @xmath76 of degree @xmath98 which is not in @xmath78 . as in 3.1 .",
    ", the same argument gives us that in fact this monomial is not in @xmath99 .",
