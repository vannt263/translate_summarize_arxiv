    "<S> by doping rh to the fe sites in srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 , superconductivity is induced when the antiferromagnetic ( af ) order is suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum superconducting transition temperature was found at about 22 k with the doping level of x = 0.25 . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the resistivity anomaly associating with the af order reveals a sharp drop for the parent phase and the samples with low doping ( x = 0.05 ) , while it evolves into an uprising at a higher doping level ( x @xmath1 0.1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a general phase diagram is depicted which exhibits the similarity with that of co doping . regarding the close maximum superconducting transition temperatures in doping co , rh and ir , we argue that the superconductivity is intimately related to the suppression of the af order , rather than the electron - phonon coupling .    </S>",
    "<S> since the material lafeaso@xmath2f@xmath3@xcite with superconductivity at 26 k was found , the feas - based systems have received tremendous attention . just in a short period </S>",
    "<S> , many materials with this unique feas - base planes were found , and very soon , the superconducting transition temperature was promoted above 50 k. it was carried out that most of the parent phase of the feas derivative compounds have an antiferromagnetic ( af ) order with a surprisingly small ordered magnetic moment.@xcite it is now widely accepted that the superconductivity can be induced when this af order is suppressed or destroyed by either doping electrons , holes or applying a pressure . @xcite . among many systems , </S>",
    "<S> the ( sr , ba)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( feas-122 ) family has received special attention since it can be fabricated easily by taking the cation doping , for example doping the sr or ba sites by k , na etc.,@xcite or substituting the fe with co or ni.@xcite in addition , large scale crystals can be grown in this structure . the early substitution of fe ions were all accomplished with the 3d - transition metals nearby fe , such as co , ni and mn . very recently , new superconductors were discovered with the substitution of fe ions with ru , ir , and pd@xcite . as a complete story , it is worth to substitute fe ions with other transition metals such as rh which locates just below co and above ir in the periodic table of elements . in this paper , we report the successfully fabrication of the new system srfe@xmath4rh@xmath5as@xmath6 with a maximum t@xmath7 of 21.9 k at about x = 0.25 . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray diffraction pattern ( xrd ) , resistivity , dc magnetic susceptibility , and upper critical field will be presented in pursuing a general phase diagram for srfe@xmath4rh@xmath5as@xmath6 .    the polycrystalline samples srfe@xmath4rh@xmath3as@xmath0 were synthesized by using a two - step solid state reaction method . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , sras , rhas and feas powders were obtained by the chemical reaction method with sr pieces , rh powders ( purity 99.95% ) , fe powders ( purity 99.99% ) and as grains . </S>",
    "<S> then they were mixed together in the formula srfe@xmath4rh@xmath5as@xmath6 , ground and pressed into a pellet shape . </S>",
    "<S> all the weighing , mixing and pressing procedures were performed in a glove box with a protective argon atmosphere ( both h@xmath0o and o@xmath0 are limited below 0.1 ppm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pellet was sealed in a silica tube with 0.2 bar of ar gas and followed by heat treatment at 900 @xmath8c for 50 hours . </S>",
    "<S> then it was cooled down slowly to room temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) measurement was performed at room temperature using an mxp18a - hf - type diffractometer with cu - k@xmath9 radiation from 10@xmath10 to 80@xmath10 with a step of 0.01@xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of x - ray powder diffraction data was done by using the software of powder - x@xcite , and the lattice constants were derived by having a general fitting ( see below ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dc magnetization measurements were done with a superconducting quantum interference device ( quantum design , squid , mpms7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the zero - field - cooled magnetization was measured by cooling the sample to 2 k at zero field , then a magnetic field was applied and the data were collected during the warming up process . </S>",
    "<S> the field - cooled magnetization data was collected in the warming up process after the sample was cooled down to 2 k at a finite magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the resistivity measurements were done with a physical property measurement system ppms-9 t ( quantum design ) with the four - probe technique . </S>",

    "<S> all main peaks of the samples can be indexed to the tetragonal structure very well . in the sample of x=0.30 , there are some tiny peaks arising from the impurity phase . for all other samples , </S>",
    "<S> the impurity phases are negligible . by fitting the xrd data to the structure calculated with the software powder - x,@xcite we get the lattice constants of srfe@xmath4rh@xmath5as@xmath6 . in figure 2 , </S>",
    "<S> the a - axis and c - axis lattice parameters for the srfe@xmath4rh@xmath5as@xmath6 samples were shown . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the c - axis lattice constant shrinks , while the a - axis one expands when more rh content are doped into the system . </S>",
    "<S> this feature general resembles that in doping ir , ru and pd into the system.@xcite normally a smaller a - axis and larger c - axis lattice constants would mean that the bond angle of as - fe - as is smaller </S>",

    "<S> the resistivity anomaly is indicated by the arrow for each doping.,width=302 ]    in figure 3 , we present the temperature dependence of resistivity for samples srfe@xmath4rh@xmath5as@xmath6 and the temperature dependence of the dc magnetization for the sample srfe@xmath13rh@xmath14as@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the parent phase exhibits a sharp drop of resistivity ( resistivity anomaly ) at about 215 k. as we can see , with more rh doped into the srfe@xmath4rh@xmath5as@xmath6 , the temperature of this anomaly was suppressed ( see , for example the sample x=0.05 ) . while the anomaly appears still as a sharp drop of resistivity . </S>",
    "<S> when x increases to 0.1 or a higher value , superconductivity appears , while the anomaly still exists . </S>",
    "<S> but now the resistivity anomaly shows up as uprising . </S>",
    "<S> this is slightly different from the case in co doping , where a very small amount of co doping will convert this sharp drop to an uprising . in the sample of x = 0.2 , </S>",
    "<S> the the resistivity anomaly disappeared completely . with </S>",
    "<S> x = 0.25 , the maximal t@xmath7 with 21.9 k was found . </S>",
    "<S> the maximal transition temperature appears at a higher doping level here ( x=0.25 ) compared with the case of doping co ( x=0.10 - 0.16 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying reason is unknown yet . </S>",
    "<S> however it is interesting to mention that in the ir - doped case , the maximal t@xmath7 appears at about x=0.45 . </S>",
    "<S> it is yet to be understood whether this is due to the evolution from doping with 3d ( co ) , 4d ( rh ) and 5d ( ir ) transition metals . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting transition temperatures in this paper were determined by a standard method , i.e. , using the crossing point of the normal state background and the extrapolation of the transition part with the most steep slope . </S>",
    "<S> a typical example is given in fig.5 by the dashed lines for the sample x=0.25 at zero field . </S>",
    "<S> the inset of figure 3 shows the temperature dependence of the dc magnetization for the sample srfe@xmath13rh@xmath14as@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement was done under a magnetic field of 20 oe in zero - field - cooled and field - cooled modes . in an enlarged view near t@xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> , a clear diamagnetic signal appears below 21@xmath15k , corresponding to the middle transition temperature of the resistivity data .    </S>",
    "<S> rh@xmath5as@xmath6 within the range of x = 0 to 0.3 . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature of resistivity anomaly represents the onset of kink in resistivity - temperature curve , which corresponds to the antiferromagnetic order / strctural transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the superconductivity starts to appear at x = 0.1 , reaching a maximum t@xmath7 of 21.9 k at about x = 0.25 . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line provides a guide to the eyes for the possible af order / strctural transitions near the optimal doping level.,width=302 ]    based on the measurements described above , we can get an electronic phase diagram for srfe@xmath4pd@xmath5as@xmath6 within the range of x = 0 to 0.3 , which is shown in figure 4 . both t@xmath16 and </S>",
    "<S> t@xmath17 was defined as the temperature at which the anomaly appears in resistivity and the superconductivity transition , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> just like other samples in feas-122 phase , with increasing rh - doping , the temperature of the anomaly is driven down , and the superconducting state emerges at x = 0.1 , reaching a maximum t@xmath7 of 21.9 k at x = 0.25 . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting state even appears at the doping level of 0.3 . </S>",
    "<S> however , from the xrd data , we can see that slight impurities are showing up in this overdoped sample . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , from the diamagnetization measurements , we found that this sample has a much smaller superconducting volume compared with that of x=0.25 . </S>",
    "<S> as one can see , there exists a region in which the antiferromagnetic and superconductivity coexists in the underdoped side . </S>",
    "<S> this general phase diagram looks very similar to that of co - doping@xcite . since rh locates just between co and ir in the periodic table of elements </S>",
    "<S> , we would conclude that the superconductivity induced by rh doping shares the similarity as that of co and ir doping .    </S>",
    "<S> rh@xmath14as@xmath6 at different magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line indicates the extrapolated resistivity in the normal state . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the superconductivity seems to be robust against the magnetic field and shifts slowly to the lower temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the inset gives the upper critical field determined using the criterion of 90%@xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> a slope of -dh@xmath19/dt = 3.8 </S>",
    "<S> t / k near t@xmath7 is found here . </S>",
    "<S> the irreversibility line h@xmath20 taking with the criterion of 0.1% @xmath18 is also presented in the inset.,width=302 ]    in figure 5 we present the temperature dependence of resistivity under different magnetic fields . just as many other iron pnictide superconductors , the superconductivity is also very robust against the magnetic field in the present sample . </S>",
    "<S> we used the criterion of @xmath21 to determine the upper critical field and show the data in the inset of figure 5 . a slope of -dh@xmath19/dt = 3.8 </S>",
    "<S> t / k can be obtained here . </S>",
    "<S> this is a rather large value which indicates a rather high upper critical field in this system . by using the werthamer - helfand - hohenberg ( whh ) formula@xcite @xmath22 </S>",
    "<S> , the value of zero temperature upper critical field can be estimated . </S>",
    "<S> taking @xmath23k , we can get @xmath24 roughly . </S>",
    "<S> this is a very large upper critical field as in k - doped@xcite and co - doped samples@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the superconductivity mechanism in the feas - based superconductors remains unclear yet . </S>",
    "<S> however , our present work and that with the co and ir doping may give some hints on that . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , the three kind of dopants ( co , rh and ir ) reside in the same column in the periodic table of elements . </S>",
    "<S> the relative atomic mass of these ions are quite different : 58.9 for co , 102.9 for rh and 192.2 for ir . </S>",
    "<S> since these atoms are doped into the feas - planes , they are certainly playing important roles in governing the superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that doping the three different atoms into the system leads to quite close maximum t@xmath7s : 24 k for co - doping , 22 k for rh - doping and 23 k for ir - doping . in the simple picture concerning the electron - phonon coupling as the mechanism for the pairing , the ir - doped sample should have the lowest t@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we can even have a brief estimate on t@xmath7 based on the electron - phonon coupling picture . </S>",
    "<S> for the co - doped sample , the maximal t@xmath7 appears at about x=0.16 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , we have a average mass ( 1.84 * 55.8 + 0.16 * 58.9)/(2fe ) = 56/fe . </S>",
    "<S> similarly in the rh doped case , the maximal t@xmath7 appears at about x=0.25 , the average mass is 61.7/fe . for ir - doping </S>",
    "<S> , the maximal t@xmath7 appears at about x=0.43 , the average mass is 85.1/fe . using the relation of the isotope effect @xmath25 and taking @xmath26 </S>",
    "<S> , we would have t@xmath7 ( co - doping):t@xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> ( rh - doping):t@xmath7 ( ir - doping ) = 1 : 0.95 : 0.81 . </S>",
    "<S> this is certainly far away from the experimental values . </S>",
    "<S> although the phonon spectrum as well as the electron band structure will change with doping co , rh and ir , above argument should be qualitatively valid . in this sense , </S>",
    "<S> the experimental data suggest that the three elements with very different mass lead to negligible effect on the superconducting transition temperatures . actually our experiment naturally supports the picture that the superconductivity is established by suppressing the af order . </S>",
    "<S> the related and widely perceived picture is that the pairing is through the inter - pocket scattering of electrons via exchanging the af spin fluctuations.@xcite by doping electrons or holes into the parent phase , the af order will be destroyed gradually . instead the short range af order will provide a wide spectrum of spin fluctuations which may play as the media for the pairing between electrons . </S>",
    "<S> this picture can certainly give a qualitative explanation to the occurrence of superconductivity in the cases of doping co , rh and ir .    in summary , superconductivity has been found in srfe@xmath2rh@xmath5as@xmath0 with the maximum t@xmath7 = 21.9 k. the phase diagram obtained is quite similar to that by doping co or ir to the fe sites . regarding the close maximal superconducting transition temperatures in doping co </S>",
    "<S> , rh and ir although they have very different masses , we argue that the superconductivity is closely related to the suppression of the af order , rather than the electron - phonon coupling .    </S>",
