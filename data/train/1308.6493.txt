    "the supersymmetric ( susy ) extension of the standard model ( sm ) is a leading candidate for physics beyond the sm . so far , however , the weak - scale susy models have been severely restricted since no evidence for new physics has been found yet ; for instance , the latest results from the lhc experiments have imposed stringent limits on the masses of the susy particles , especially those of colored particles @xcite .",
    "in addition , the higgs boson with a mass of @xmath8  gev @xcite , which was recently discovered at the lhc  @xcite , might also indicate that the susy particles are well above @xmath9  tev , since in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) sufficient radiative corrections are required in order to realize the mass of the higgs boson @xcite . unless the higgs sector is modified nor the left- and right - handed stops adequately mix with each other , such a large quantum effect is only provided with heavy stops having masses of much higher than the electroweak scale .",
    "the current situation motivates us to study models with a high susy breaking scale .",
    "such models assume that susy is broken at a scale of @xmath10  tev to yield the 126  gev higgs boson @xcite . in this case ,",
    "scalar particles except the lightest higgs boson acquire masses of the order of the susy breaking scale .",
    "fermionic superpartners , on the other hand , may be much lighter than the other sparticles since their masses are protected by chiral symmetries .",
    "indeed , such a mass spectrum is realized with a simple susy breaking mechanism in which susy is broken by a non - singlet field and the breaking effects are transmitted to the visible sector via a generic khler potential . in this framework ,",
    "the gaugino masses are induced by the anomaly mediation @xcite and suppressed by one - loop factors compared with the scalar mass . with the susy breaking scale being @xmath10  tev",
    ", gauginos may lie around the tev scale .",
    "the neutral wino turns out to be the lightest susy particle in this model , and may make up a main component of the dark matter in the universe @xcite .",
    "further , it is found that the gauge coupling unification is not only preserved but improved in the scenario @xcite .",
    "thus , the high - scale susy models have interesting features from a phenomenological point of view @xcite , and recently attract a lot of attention especially after the early lhc runnings @xcite .",
    "although it is difficult to investigate the high - scale susy scenario at high - energy collider experiments , the low - energy precision experiments might catch up the susy signature . without any flavor symmetries ,",
    "soft susy breaking parameters in general give rise to extra sources of flavor and/or cp violation @xcite .",
    "these effects , such as the flavor - changing neutral currents and the hadronic and leptonic electric dipole moments ( edms ) , are suppressed by sfermion masses , and thus the high - scale susy models do not conflict with the current experimental results for these quantities . among such experiments , the measurement of the edms offers a promising way to look for the signature of the susy particles @xcite . since in the sm",
    "the edms induced by the cp phase in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix are considerably below the sensitivities of the present and near future experiments @xcite , the edm measurement is free from the sm background , thus provides a clean environment to detect a sign of high - energy physics beyond the sm .",
    "the effective interactions which give rise to the edms are expressed in terms of the flavor - conserving cp - violating effective operators . in susy models ,",
    "such operators are induced by diagrams in which susy particles run in the loop . in the case of the high - scale susy scenario",
    ", however , one needs to pay particular attention to the calculation of the diagrams ; as mentioned above , there exists a large difference between the mass scales of scalar and fermionic susy particles and this hierarchy causes large logarithmic factors which may spoil the perturbation theory . to evade the difficulties , we need to evaluate the effective operators by means of the renormalization - group equations ( rges ) .",
    "the renormalization corrections are particularly important for the operators including colored particles because of the large value of the strong coupling constant .    in this paper , we study the qcd effects on the flavor - preserving cp - odd quark and gluon operators generated by the squark - gluino interactions . among the operators , the edms and the chromoelectric dipole moments ( cedms ) of quarks have the lowest mass - dimensions , and thus sensitive to the susy contribution .",
    "we focus on these two operators and study the contribution of the quark - gluino four - fermi operators to the quantities .",
    "the calculation is divided into two steps ; first , by integrating out squarks , we construct an effective theory with quarks , gluons , photons , and gluinos .",
    "then , the effective operators are evolved down to the gluino threshold according to the rges . during the rge flow , the cedms",
    "are radiatively generated from the dimension - six quark - gluino operators .",
    "the resultant edms and cedms evaluated in this way are compared with the results based on the computation of the one - loop diagrams .",
    "possible ways of improvement of the calculation are also discussed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we write down the cp - violating effective operators involving quarks , gluons , photons , and gluinos which we consider in the following discussion , and present the anomalous dimension matrix for the operators .",
    "the wilson coefficients of the effective operators are evaluated in the mssm with and without the assumption of the minimal flavor violation in the sections [ mfv ] and [ generic ] , respectively .",
    "evolving them down according to the rges , we obtain the edms and cedms of light quarks at the hadron scale , and compare them with the explicit one - loop calculation .",
    "section  [ conclusion ] is devoted to conclusion and discussion .",
    "to begin with , we write down the cp - violating effective operators at the hadron scale ( @xmath11  gev ) which consist of the flavor - diagonal operators of light quarks , photons , and gluons up to dimension - five : @xmath12 here , @xmath13 are the quark masses , @xmath14 is the strong coupling constant ( @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are the generators of the su(3)@xmath17 . @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the field strength tensors of photon and gluon , and their dual fields are defined by , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "the second term of the above expression is the effective qcd @xmath22 term , which is connected with the first term through the chiral rotation .",
    "these two terms are suppressed in the presence of the peccei - quinn symmetry @xcite .",
    "the third and fourth terms represent the edms and the cedms for light quarks , respectively .",
    "they are dimension - five operators , and thus quite sensitive to the high - scale physics beyond the sm .",
    "apart from the sm contribution , these operators are induced by diagrams where susy particles run in the loop . in this paper , we focus on the susy contribution and discuss the qcd effects on it at the leading order in @xmath23 . in particular , we consider the case where a large mass difference between the scalar particles and gauginos exists .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , such a hierarchical mass spectrum often shows up in the high - scale susy models . to appropriately include the qcd corrections in the presence of the large mass hierarchy , we evaluate them based on the method of the effective field theory as well as the rges .",
    "first , by integrating out squark fields , we obtain the effective lagrangian below the susy breaking scale , which involves only gluinos and the sm fields .",
    "the short - distance effects , which reflect the cp - violation due to the susy particles , are included into the wilson coefficients of the effective operators matched at the susy breaking scale .",
    "next , the effective operators are evolved down to the gluino threshold according to the rges .",
    "then , at the threshold , the gluino fields are integrated out to give the effective theory which contains only the sm fields . after this step",
    ", the ordinary procedure is applied to estimate the effects of the cp - violating operators on the low - energy physics such as the neutron edm .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to formulate the first two steps in terms of the operator product expansions and the rges .",
    "the effective lagrangian below the susy breaking scale is given as follows : @xmath24 where @xmath25 here , @xmath26 are the electric charges for light quarks with @xmath27 .",
    "the covariant derivative for quarks is defined as @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) with @xmath30 and @xmath31 the u(1)@xmath32 and su(3)@xmath17 gauge fields , respectively .",
    "@xmath33 denotes gluinos , which are majorana fermions and form an adjoint representation under the su(3)@xmath34 transformations .",
    "the totally symmetric factor @xmath35 is defined by @xmath36 , while @xmath37 is the structure constant of the su(3 ) group with @xmath38=if_{abc}t_c$ ] .",
    "the wilson coefficients of the operators , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , are obtained by integrating out squark fields at the susy breaking scale .    in eq .",
    "we only keep the operators which give significant corrections to the quark edms and cedms .",
    "let us comment on the operators which we ignore in the following analysis .",
    "first , we do not consider the dimension - four operators in eq .",
    "since they do not contribute to the rges for the dimension - five operators . especially , when the peccei - quinn symmetry is imposed , these dimension - four operators are suppressed and the edms and cedms give dominant contributions to the hadronic and atomic edms .",
    "also , we ignore the dimension - five gluino cedm , @xmath42 , since it does not affect the running of the operators in eq .   at the leading order in @xmath23 .",
    "as for the dimension - six operators , the weinberg operator @xmath43 @xcite , four - quark operators , and four - gluino operators might also yield sizable effects on the radiative corrections to the operators above .",
    "these dimension - six operators are , however , generated at @xmath44 in the case of the mssm , and thus safely neglected in the leading order calculation .",
    "next , we evaluate the anomalous dimensions of the operators in eq .   at the leading order .",
    "the rge for the wilson coefficients in eq .   is written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a column vector defined by @xmath47 then , we obtain the following anomalous dimension matrix at one - loop level : @xmath48   \\frac{1}{(4\\pi)^2}\\gamma_{q\\tilde{g } } &   \\frac{\\alpha_s}{4\\pi}\\gamma_{\\tilde{g } }   \\end{pmatrix } ~,\\ ] ] with @xmath49 @xmath50 and @xmath51 here , @xmath52 is the number of colors , @xmath53 is the quadratic casimir invariant for the fundamental representation , and @xmath54 is the mass of gluino . the anomalous dimension matrix for the dimension - five operators @xmath55 is readily obtained from that for the dipole - type operators relevant to the @xmath56 process @xcite .",
    "note that the coefficient of @xmath57 is not suppressed by the strong coupling constant @xmath23 .",
    "in this case , the scale - dependence arises from a mismatch in the dimension between the dimension - five and -six operators @xcite .",
    "a similar feature is found in the case of four - quark operators mixing into the quark edms and cedms , as discussed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "now all we have to do is to compute the wilson coefficients in eq .   by integrating out squarks in a certain model .",
    "then , by evolving them down according to the rge , we obtain the quark edms and cedms in the low - energy region . in the following discussion , we take up the mssm as an example . also , in this section , we focus on the case with the so - called minimal flavor violation @xcite , which assumes that the ckm matrix is the only source for all of the flavor - violating terms in the mssm .    in the present case ,",
    "the tree - level squark exchanging diagrams give rise to the cp - odd quark - gluino four - fermi operators , which are to induce the quark cedms radiatively .",
    "the squark mass matrix has the following form : @xmath58 m_qx^*_q & m^2_{\\tilde{q}^{}_r } \\end{pmatrix } \\begin{pmatrix }   \\tilde{q}^{}_l\\\\[6pt ] \\tilde{q}^{}_r \\end{pmatrix } ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath59 and @xmath60 represent the left- and right - handed squarks , respectively , and @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) for up - type ( down - type ) quarks .",
    "here we assume that the trilinear soft scalar couplings ( the so - called @xmath63-terms ) @xmath64 are proportional to the corresponding yukawa couplings . in @xmath65",
    ", @xmath66 is the higgsino - mass parameter and @xmath67 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the mssm higgs fields . throughout this article",
    "we take a convention where the gaugino masses are set to be real parameters , without loss of generality . on the assumption of the minimal flavor violation ,",
    "the flavor - mixings in the squark mass matrix are considerably suppressed , so we neglect them in the present discussion .",
    "we also take @xmath68 and @xmath69 , for simplicity .",
    "then , by evaluating the squark exchanging diagrams , we readily obtain the wilson coefficients at the scalar mass scale @xmath70 : @xmath71 and @xmath72 notice that the quark edms and cedms vanish at tree - level .",
    "they are induced radiatively through the mixing terms in rges and also from the short - distance contribution , as will be shown below .    by using eqs .   and",
    "as initial conditions , we solve the rge to evaluate the wilson coefficients at the gluino threshold .",
    "especially , in the leading - logarithmic approximation , the quark cedms are generated as @xmath73 while the edms vanish at the leading order .",

    "<S> recent results from the lhc experiments , both for the higgs mass measurement and the direct search for supersymmetric ( susy ) particles , might indicate that the susy breaking scale is much higher than the electroweak scale . </S>",
    "<S> although it is difficult to investigate such a scenario at collider experiments , the measurement of the hadronic electric dipole moments is one of promising ways to detect the effects of the susy particles . </S>",
    "<S> these effects are expressed in terms of the cp - violating effective operators defined at the susy breaking scale , which involve quarks , gluons , photons , and gluinos . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss the qcd corrections to the effective operators in the high - scale susy scenario . to appropriately evaluate the radiative corrections in the presence of large mass hierarchy among the susy particles , we exploit an effective theoretical approach based on the renormalization - group equations . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that the low - energy quark electric and chromoelectric dipole moments may differ from those evaluated in previous works by @xmath0 % and @xmath1 % , respectively .    </S>",
