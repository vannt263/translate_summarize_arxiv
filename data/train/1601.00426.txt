    "techniques involving laser cooling and trapping of neutral atoms are of immense interest for many scientific applications , including those that are capable of probing new physics @xcite and searching for exotic quantum phase transitions using ultracold atoms  @xcite . in particular , trapping atoms using optical lattices have many advantages since they offer long storage time  @xcite and their energy levels can be easily accessed using lasers @xcite .",
    "it is conducive to carry out measurements in a transition of an optically trapped atom without realizing the stark shifts due to the applied laser field .",
    "one can achieve this by trapping the atom at the wavelengths for which the differential stark shift of the transition gets nullified .",
    "these wavelengths are popularly known as magic wavelengths ( @xmath3s )  @xcite .",
    "they play crucial role in state - insensitive quantum engineering to set - up many high precision experiments .",
    "they are useful in the atomic clock experiments to acquire relative uncertainty as small as @xmath4  @xcite , in the quantum information and communication studies @xcite , investigating fundamental physics @xcite , so on .",
    "alkali atoms are mostly preferred for performing experiments using laser cooling and trapping techniques .",
    "the reason being that the low - lying transitions in these atoms are conveniently accessible by the available lasers .",
    "since cs atom has wider hyperfine splittings in its ground state , it has been considered for making microwave clock and for quantum computation . for laser cooling of these atoms ,",
    "its @xmath5-@xmath2 transitions are mainly being used .",
    "owing to a large number of applications of trapped cs atoms , it would be imperative to find out all plausible magic wavelengths of these transitions such that lasers can be appropriately chosen at these wavelengths to reduce systematics significantly in the above possible measurements due to the stark shifts .",
    "had experimentally demonstrated @xmath3 at 935.6 nm for the @xmath5-@xmath2 transition in cs @xcite using linearly polarized light . following this , magic wavelengths for many alkali atoms including cs atom",
    "were determined using linearly polarized light by arora _",
    "_  @xcite by evaluating the dynamic polarizabilities of these atoms using the relativistic coupled cluster ( rcc ) method .",
    "the estimation of ac stark shifts using circularly polarized light may be advantageous to look for magic wavelengths owing to the predominant role played by the vector polarizabilities .",
    "since the vector polarizability contribution is absent in the use of linearly polarized light , this can open - up new windows to manipulate the magic wavelengths for a wide range of applications .",
    "recently , we had investigated magic wavelengths in the lighter alkali atoms for circularly polarized light and realized many possible magic wavelengths , especially for the @xmath6-@xmath7 transitions with the ground state principal quantum number @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "however , magic wavelengths for circularly polarized light in the cs atom have not been explored sufficiently .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     to reduce the uncertainties in the evaluation of these polarizability values , we use e1 matrix elements for @xmath9 transitions extracted from the very precisely measured lifetimes of the @xmath2 and @xmath1 states of cs by rafac _",
    "et al_. @xcite .",
    "we also use e1 matrix elements for the @xmath10 transitions compiled in ref .",
    "@xcite , which are derived from the measured lifetime of the @xmath11 state .",
    "similarly , the e1 matrix element of @xmath12 transition has been derived by combining the measured differential stark shift of the d1 line with the experimental value of the ground state dipole polarizability of amini _ et al_. @xcite .",
    "we adopt a procedure similar to that is given in ref .",
    "@xcite to determine the e1 matrix elements from the measured stark shifts .",
    "the values of these matrix elements along with their experimental uncertainties are listed in table  [ pol1 ] .",
    "otherwise , the required e1 matrix elements for considered transitions up to @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 states are obtained by employing sd method as described in the previous section .",
    "the uncertainties in these matrix elements are calculated by comparing matrix elements for the @xmath9 and @xmath10 transitions calculated using our method and available experimental values .",
    "the maximum difference between the experiment and our results for these matrix elements is 6% .",
    "therefore , we assign maximum a 10% uncertainty to all the matrix elements given in table  [ pol1 ]",
    ". we have used 70 b - spline functions confined within a cavity of radius @xmath16 a.u . to construct the single - particle orbitals .",
    "we use experimental values of the excitation energies of these transitions from the national institute of science and technology ( nist ) database @xcite to reduce further the uncertainties in the evaluation of the polarizabilities .",
    "our calculated value of @xmath17 for the ground state is 399.5 a.u . , which matches very well with other theoretical values 399 a.u . and 399.9 a.u",
    "estimated by borschevsky _",
    "_ @xcite and derevianko _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , using the other variants of rcc method , respectively .",
    "these results are also in very good agreement with the experimental result 401.0(6 ) a.u . measured by amini _",
    ". _ @xcite using the time - of - flight technique .",
    "similarly our calculation gives @xmath17 of the @xmath18 state to be 1335 a.u .",
    ", which is slightly larger than the other calculated value 1290 a.u . of wijngaarden _",
    "@xcite but agrees quite well with another calculated value 1338 a.u . reported by arora _",
    "_ @xcite and the measured value 1328.4(6 ) a.u . reported in ref . @xcite . in the work of wijngaarden _",
    "et al . _ , polarizabilities were evaluated using the oscillator strengths from the method of bates and damgaard @xcite .",
    "the scalar and tensor polarizabilities of the @xmath19 state using our method are obtained to be 1644 a.u . and @xmath20 a.u .",
    ", respectively .",
    "they are also in very good agreement with the experimental values reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and are in reasonable agreement with the theoretical values reported by arora _",
    "_ @xcite and wijngaarden _ et al .",
    "the above analysis shows that we have obtained very accurate values of the dipole polarizabilities using our method of evaluation .",
    "this justifies that determining dynamic polarizabilities using the same procedure can also provide competent results .",
    "hence , @xmath21 values of the @xmath22 transitions in cs can be determined without any ambiguity using these accurate values of the dipole polarizabilities .",
    "we now proceed to determine @xmath21s for the @xmath22 transitions in the cs atom . for this purpose ,",
    "we plot the dynamic dipole polarizabilities of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 states in figs .",
    "[ magiccirc4 ] , [ magiccirc3 ] , [ magiccirc1 ] and [ magiccirc2 ] .",
    "they are shown in the upper and lower halves for linearly and circularly polarized light respectively .",
    "we use left circularly polarized light ( @xmath25 ) while determining the magic wavelengths .",
    "note that it is not required to produce results for right circularly polarized light ( @xmath26 ) separately , because the results for @xmath21s will be same as that for left circularly polarized light with the counter sign of @xmath27 sublevels .",
    "for this purpose we consider only left handed circularly polarized light with all positive and negative @xmath27 values .",
    "we consider all possible @xmath27 values of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 states .",
    "it is evident from the above plots that for the considered wavelength range , the dynamic polarizability for the @xmath23 state is generally small except in the close vicinity of the resonant @xmath28 and @xmath29 transitions .",
    "on the other hand , polarizabilities of the @xmath30 states have significant contributions from several resonant transitions .",
    "thus , the polarizability curves of the @xmath30 states cross with the polarizability curve of the @xmath23 state in between these resonant transitions .",
    "the wavelengths at which intersections of these polarizability curves take place are recognized as @xmath31s in the above figures for both linearly and circularly polarized light .",
    "we have also tabulated these values for the @xmath22 transitions in tables [ magic3 ] ,  [ magic1 ] , [ magic2 ] and [ magic22 ] along with their respective uncertainties in the parentheses .",
    "these uncertainties are estimated by considering maximum possible errors in the estimated differential polarizabilities between the involved states in a transition .",
    "the corresponding values of the dynamic polarizabilities are also mentioned in the above tables to provide an estimate of the kind of trapping potential required at those magic wavelengths .",
    "we also list the resonant wavelengths ( @xmath32 ) in the tables to highlight the respective placements of these @xmath33s .",
    "as seen from table [ magic3 ] , we find @xmath34s for the @xmath35 transition around 630 nm , 660 nm and 760 nm for both linearly and circularly polarized light .",
    "other @xmath33s are located at 1522 nm for the linearly polarized light and around 1966 nm with @xmath18(@xmath27=1/2 ) for the circularly polarized light .",
    "@xmath33s at 632 , 756.1 and 1966 nms does not support state - insensitive trapping for @xmath36 sublevel of the @xmath18 state and hence switching trapping scheme as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite can be used here . in this approach",
    ", the change of sign of @xmath37 will lead to the same result for the positive values of @xmath27 sublevels of the @xmath30 state .",
    "@xmath33s at 1522 nm and 1966.1 nm support the red detuned trap , while the other above mentioned @xmath33s support the blue detuned traps .",
    "values of @xmath34s for the linearly polarized light are also compared with @xmath33s of arora _ et al . _",
    "reported in ref .",
    "both findings agree with each other , as the method of calculation in both is almost similar .",
    "similarly , we tabulate @xmath33s for the @xmath38 transition in same table .",
    "it can be evidently seen from the table that @xmath33s are red shifted from the @xmath33s for @xmath35 .",
    "we have also determined an extra @xmath33 at 880.79 nm , which supports a red detuned trap .",
    "we list @xmath33s for the @xmath39 transition for linearly and circularly polarized light separately in tables [ magic1 ] and [ magic2 ] respectively . in case of the linearly polarized light",
    ", at least ten @xmath33s are systematically located between the resonant transitions with @xmath40 , while only seven @xmath33s are located for the @xmath41 sublevel .",
    "it , thus , implies that use of linearly polarized light does not completely support state insensitive trapping of this transition and results are dependent on the @xmath27 sublevels of the @xmath19 state .",
    "this is also in agreement with the results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . the experimental magic wavelength at 935.6 nm , as demonstrated by mckeever _ et .",
    "@xcite , matches well with the average of the last two magic wavelengths obtained at 933 nm ( for @xmath40 ) and 941.7 nm ( for @xmath41 ) . as shown in table",
    "[ magic2 ] , we get a set of ten magic wavelengths for circularly polarized light in between the eleven @xmath19 resonances lying in the wavelength range 600 - 1600 nm .",
    "those magic wavelengths for which the values corresponding to @xmath42 sublevels are absent , do not support state - insensitive trapping , and we recommend the use of a switching trapping scheme for this transition as proposed in @xcite . for the @xmath43 transition , we enlist the @xmath33s in table [ magic22 ] .",
    "these @xmath33s are slightly red shifted to those demonstrated for @xmath43 transition .",
    "we have investigated possible magic wavelengths within the wavelength range 600 - 2000 nm for the @xmath22 transitions in the cs atom considering both linearly and circularly polarized light .",
    "our values for linearly polarized light were compared with the previously estimated values and they are found to be in good agreement . with circularly polarized light , we find a large number of magic wavelengths that are in the optical region and would be of immense interest for carrying out many precision measurements at these wavelengths where the above transitions are used for the laser cooling purposes .",
    "we have used very precise electric dipole matrix elements , extracting from the observed lifetimes and evaluating using the relativistic coupled - cluster method , to evaluate the dynamic polarizabilities of the cs atom very precisely .",
    "these quantities are used to determine the above magic wavelengths . by comparing static values of the polarizabilities with their respective experimental results , accuracies of",
    "the polarizabilities and magic wavelengths were adjudged . in few situations",
    ", we found it would be advantageous to use the magic wavelengths of circularly polarized light over linearly polarized light .",
    "as an example , magic wavelengths for circularly light are missing for some @xmath44 sublevel but they are present for the corresponding @xmath45 sublevel or vice - versa . in this case",
