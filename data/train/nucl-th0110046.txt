    "a considerable amount of work has been done both in the experimental and the theoretical aspects of the physics of single and double @xmath3 hypernuclei  @xcite .",
    "because of the lack of targets , the data on @xmath0 hypernuclei provide a unique method to learn details on the strangeness @xmath4 sector of the baryon - baryon interaction .",
    "ground state energies of three ( the production of @xmath5h has been recently reported  @xcite ) @xmath0 hypernuclei , @xmath6he , @xmath7be and @xmath8b , have been measured .",
    "the experimental binding energies , @xmath9 $ ] , are reported in table  [ tab : bll ] .",
    "note that the @xmath6he energy has been updated very recently  @xcite in contradiction to the old one , @xmath10= 10.9@xmath110.8 mev  @xcite .",
    "the scarce hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath12 ) scattering data have been used by the nijmegen ( njg ) , bonn - jlich ( bj ) and tbingen groups  @xcite to determine realistic @xmath12 and thus also some pieces of the @xmath13 interactions . in ref .",
    "@xcite an effective @xmath0 interaction , with a form inspired in the one boson exchange ( obe ) bj potentials  @xcite , was fitted to data , and the first attempts to compare it to the free space one were carried out .",
    "similar studies using obe njg potentials  @xcite have been also performed in ref .",
    "@xcite and the weak decays of double @xmath3 hypernuclei have been studied in ref .",
    "short range correlations ( src ) play an important role in these systems  @xcite , but despite of their inclusion the effective @xmath0 interaction , fitted to the @xmath14hypernuclei data , significantly differs from the free space one deduced in ref .",
    "@xcite from scattering data . in this letter",
    "we consider the new datum for he and , importantly , the effect of the long range nuclear correlations ( rpa ) is also incorporated .",
    "starting from the free space bj interactions , we find a good description of the masses of he , be and b @xmath0 hypernuclei .",
    "this has never been achieved before despite the use of different @xmath0 free space interactions  @xcite .",
    "the bj set of potentials used here and the new njg ( nsc97e , b  @xcite ) interactions are similar in shape , though the latter ones are shifted around 0.2 fm to larger distances as compared to the bj potentials . due to the difficulty of including rpa effects in njg models and",
    "since both sets of interactions give similar energies in absence of nuclear effects , in this work we have used bj - type potentials .",
    "following the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , we model the @xmath0 hypernuclei by an interacting three - body @xmath15nuclear core system . thus , we determine the intrinsic wave  function , @xmath16 , and the binding energy @xmath17 , where @xmath18 are the relative coordinates of the hyperons respect to the nucleus , from the intrinsic hamiltonian .",
    "@xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the nuclear core and the @xmath3-core reduced masses respectively .",
    "the @xmath3-nuclear core potential , @xmath23 , is adjusted to reproduce the binding energies , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , of the corresponding single@xmath3 hypernuclei  @xcite , and @xmath26 stands for the @xmath0 interaction in the medium . due to the presence of the second @xmath3 a dynamical re - ordering effect in the nuclear core",
    "is produced . both the @xmath0 free interaction and this re - ordering of the nuclear core ,",
    "contribute to @xmath27 .",
    "however , the latter effect is suppressed with respect to the former one by at least one power of the nuclear density , which is the natural parameter in all many body quantum theory expansions .",
    "we assume the nuclear core dynamical re - ordering effects to be around 0.5 mev , as the findings of the @xmath28cluster models of ref .",
    "@xcite suggest , for he , be and b @xmath0 hypernuclei , and negligible for medium and heavy ones .",
    "this estimate for the size of the theoretical uncertainties is of the order of the experimental errors of @xmath17 reported in table  [ tab : bll ] .",
    "furthermore , the rpa model used below to determine @xmath26 accounts for particle - hole ( @xmath29 ) excitations of the nuclear core and thus it partially includes some nuclear core reordering effects .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , both hartree - fock ( hf ) and variational ( var ) , where src can been included , schemes to solve the hamiltonian of eq .  ( [ eq : sch ] ) were studied . in both cases ,",
    "the nuclear medium effective @xmath0 interactions fitted to data were much more attractive than that deduced from the free space @xmath12 scattering data .",
    "since the @xmath0 interactions obtained by @xmath30 exchanges behave almost like a hard - core at short distances , the var energies are around 30 - 40% lower than the hf ones ( see fig . 4 and table 9 of ref .",
    "hence , trying to link free space to the effective interaction , @xmath26 , requires the use of a variational approach where @xmath31correlations ( src ) are naturally considered .",
    "we have used a family of @xmath32 @xmath14wave functions of the form : @xmath33 , with @xmath34 the spin - singlet , @xmath35 and @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are free parameters to be determined by minimizing the energy , @xmath40 is a normalization factor and @xmath41 is the @xmath42wave @xmath43function in the single@xmath3 hypernucleus @xmath44 .",
    "this var scheme differs appreciably to that used in ref .",
    "there , @xmath45 was expanded in series of hylleraas type terms whereas here we have adopted a jastrow  type correlation function .",
    "hylleraas src , though suited for atomic physics , are not efficient to deal with almost hard core potentials , as it is the case here .",
    "thus , to achieve convergence in ref .",
    "@xcite a total of 161 terms ( 161 unknown parameters ) were considered .",
    "the ansatz of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ans ] ) , which has only seven parameters and thus it leads to manageable wave functions , satisfactorily reproduces all var results of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the potential @xmath26 represents an effective interaction which accounts for the dynamics of the @xmath0 pair in the nuclear medium , but which does not describe their dynamics in the vacuum .",
    "this effective interaction is usually approximated by an induced interaction  @xcite ( @xmath46 ) which is constructed in terms of the @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) , @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) @xmath53matrices , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : medium ] . the induced interaction , @xmath46 combines the dynamics at short distances ( accounted by the effective interaction @xmath48 ) and the dynamics at long distances which is taken care of by means of the iteration of @xmath29 excitations ( rpa series ) through the effective interactions @xmath50 and @xmath52 . near threshold ( @xmath54 )",
    ", the @xmath55 baryon - baryon interaction might be described in terms of only two coupled channels @xmath0 and @xmath56 . for two @xmath3 hyperons bound in a nuclear medium and because of pauli - blocking",
    ", it is reasonable to think that the ratio of strengths of the @xmath57 and the diagonal @xmath47 ( with no @xmath56 intermediate states ) transitions is suppressed respect to the free space case .",
    "this is explicitly shown for @xmath6he in ref .",
    "@xcite , though a recent work  @xcite , using a njg model , finds increases of the order of 0.4 mev in the calculated @xmath17 values , for he , be and b @xmath0 hypernuclei , due to @xmath56 components . in any - case 0.4",
    "mev is of the order of the experimental and other theoretical uncertainties discussed above , and we will assume that the data of @xmath0 hypernuclei would mainly probe the free space , @xmath58 , diagonal @xmath0 element of the @xmath59 potential .",
    "hence @xmath48 might be roughly approximated by @xmath58 , and the interaction @xmath26 can be splited into two terms @xmath60 , where the first one accounts for the first diagram of the rhs of fig .",
    "[ fig : medium ] and @xmath61 does it for the remaining rpa series depicted in this figure . let us examine in detail each of the terms .",

    "@xmath70 symmetry is used to relate the couplings of the @xmath67 and @xmath68mesons to the @xmath3 hyperon to those of these mesons to the nucleons .",
    "we adopt the so - called `` ideal '' mixing angle ( @xmath71 ) for which the @xmath72 meson comes out as a pure @xmath73 state and hence one gets a vanishing @xmath74 coupling  @xcite .",
