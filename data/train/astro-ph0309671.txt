    "if so , one could hopefully ease the cosmic coincidence problem , i.e. that dm and de densities , after being different by orders of magnitude for most of the cosmic history , approach equal values only in today s universe .",
    "the simplest way to deal with this idea amounts to admit an interaction between dm and de @xcite . in a number of papers @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that , at the linear level , this causes no apparent conflict with lss or cbr data .",

    "other models that propose a direct link between dm and de invoke a unified model ( e.g. @xcite ) or condensation mechanisms @xcite .    an open question , then , concerns the emergence of non  linear structures in these models and how easy it is to fit observed lss data with predictable features . in this work",

    ", @xmath15 gradually increases and , eventually , approaches and exceeds @xmath65 ; then , the world enters the _ tracking phase _ , whose details depend on the potential shape ; for most potentials , such phase ends up into a _ global attractor _ , when de density overwhelms dm and any other densities .    along the expansion history ,",
    "the scaling of @xmath67 ( dm density ) is modified with respect to the uncoupled case and reads @xmath68 here the subscript @xmath69 indicates value at the present time @xmath70 , while we take @xmath71",
    ". meanwhile the baryon density grows as @xmath72 , as usual .    in the next section",

    "all along these stages , however , according to the friedman equations , the following relation holds @xcite : @xmath76 therefore , once the @xmath29 dependence of the baryon density parameter is given , all derivatives in respect to time can be easily converted into derivatives in respect to the scale factor .",
    "this relation will be used in the implementation of the art program .",

    "shall then be used to obtain the dependence on time .",
    "we shall omit here the general form of these equations ( see @xcite ) , and will write them in the newtonian limit , i.e. for small scales ( in comparison with the horizon scale @xmath90 ) and small velocities ( in respect to @xmath91 ) .",
    "the former condition tells us to consider the lowest order terms in @xmath92 ; in this limit , the gravitational potential fulfills equations that can be written in a simpler form by defining the function @xmath93 according to @xmath94,\\ ] ] as well as the functions @xmath95 notice that this is no restriction on the potential shape .",
    "then @xmath96 while the scalar field fulfills the equation @xmath97 these expressions have been simplified by using the variables @xmath98 ( kinetic density parameter ) and @xmath99 ( potential densiity parameter ) .",
    "it follows that if the de kinetic ( or potential ) energy density gives a substantial contribution to the expansion source , @xmath100 ( or @xmath101 ) is @xmath102(1 ) .    in the newtonian limit",

    "( [ velocity ] ) yields @xmath119 where dots yield differentiation in respect to ordinary time , @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "we can integrate this equation , taking into account that the acceleration is radial , as the attracting particle lays in the origin .",
    "it will then be @xmath122 @xmath123 being the modulus of the ( radial ) acceleration ( in the second term @xmath124 ) .",
    "accordingly , for a cdm particle , the desired expression of the radial acceleration reads @xmath125 ( @xmath126 is a unit vector in the radial direction ; @xmath127 ) which has various peculiarities and ought to be suitably commented .",
    "to this aim it is important to compare it with the radial acceleration @xmath128 of a baryon particle . in the expression ( [ finalc ] ) , notice first the velocity term .",
    "this is a peculiar acceleration that exist even in the absence of particles displaying their attraction ; its presence means that cdm matter is not expanding in a comoving way , due to the extra gravity it feels .",
    "accordingly , its particles do not follow geodesics , because their mass changes in time , and their ordinary ( not comoving ) linear momentum obeys the equation @xmath129    baryon particles , instead , safely follow geodesics , although feeling that cdm particle masses are varying .",
    "let us conclude this section by summarising its specific findings : ( i ) the mass assigned to cdm particles does vary in time , being @xmath130 , while baryon particles do keep a constant mass .",
    "( ii ) when interacting between them , cdm particles feel an effective gravitational constant @xmath131 ; any other particle  particle interaction occurs with the ordinary newtonian interaction constant @xmath2 .",
    "particle mass variations and different interaction constants ought to be taken into account in performing n ",
    "body simulations .",
    "they will be based on the adaptive refiniment tree code ( art ) @xcite that has been suitably modified to deal with coupled de models . the art code starts with a uniform grid , which covers the whole computational box .",
    "this grid defines the lowest ( zeroth ) level of resolution of the simulation .",
    "the standard particle - mesh algorithms are used to compute density and gravitational potential on the zero - level mesh .",
    "the art code reaches high force resolution by refining all high density regions using an automated refinement algorithm .",
    "the refiniments are recursive : the refined regions can also be refined , each subsequent refinement meshes of different resolution , size , and geometry covering regions of interests .",
    "because each individual cubic cell can be refined , the shape of the refinement mesh can be arbitrary and match effectively the geometry of the region of interest .",
    "the criterion for refinement is the local density of particles : if the number of particles ina a mesh cell ( as estimated by the cloud - in - cell method ) exceeds the level of @xmath132 , the cell is split (  \" refined  \" ) in 8 cell of the next refinement level .",
    "the refinement threshold depends on the refinement level .",
    "for the zero s level it is @xmath133 .",
    "for the higher level it is set to @xmath134 .",
    "the code uses the expansion parameter @xmath29 as the variable tiome . during the integration , spatial refinement",
    "is accompanied by temporal refinement .",
    "namely , each level of refinement , @xmath135 , is integrated with its own time step @xmath136,where @xmath137 is the global time step of the zeroth refinement level .",
    "this variable time stepping is very important for the accuracy of the results .",
    "as the force resolution increases , more steps are needed to integrate the trajectories accurately .",
    "extensive tests of the code and comparison with other numerical n - body codes can be found in @xcite .",
    "let us now describe the three main modifications we made to handle coupled de .",
    "a first step amounts to distinguish between baryons and dm particles , which feel different gravitational forces .",
    "therefore , the potential on the grid is to be calculated twice , so to fix the different forces that baryon and dm particles feel .",
    "all particles act on baryons through the usual gravitational constant @xmath2 , which sets also the action of baryons on dm particles .",
    "dm particles instead , act on dm particles through a different interaction constant @xmath131 .",
    "the gravitational force is then computed through the usual fft approach .",
    "a second step amounts to take into account that the effective mass of dm particles is time varying .",
    "aside of the acceleration due to gravitation , each dm particle will therefore undergo an extra acceleration @xmath138 .",
    "besides of these two changes , peculiar of coupled de models , we ought to take into account the right relation between @xmath29 and @xmath139 , as shown in eq .  ( [ chi ] ) , where @xmath140 is given . by solving the background equations , in a suitable file we provide @xmath141 in @xmath142 scale factor values @xmath143 , that we than interpolate .",
    "the models listed in table 1 were first simulated in a @xmath144mpc box .",
    "we then selected the same halo in all simulations and magnified it .",
    "the low  resolution simulation , performed with a force resolution of @xmath145 mpc and a mass resolution @xmath146 , allowed us to evaluate the halo mass function .",
    "the high  resulution simulation , performed with a force resolution of @xmath147kpc and a mass resolution of @xmath148 , magnified a sphere with a radius of @xmath149mpc , centered on the halo , allowing us to compare halo profiles down to a radius @xmath150kpc .",
    "besides of the above points , we could also test the non  linear evolution of the _ bias _ between the amplitudes of inhomogeneities in baryons and dm .",
    "such bias is one of the most peculiar features of coupled de models and we shall describe how non  linearity modifies it .",
    "we identify halos in simulations by using a so algorithm , that we shall now describe in more detail . as first step ,",
    "candidate halos are located by a fof procedure , with linking length @xmath151 ( @xmath152 is the average particle separation ) and keeping groups with more than @xmath153 particles ( @xmath154 and @xmath153 fixed herebelow ) .",
    "we then perform two operations : ( i ) we find the point , @xmath155 , where the gravitational potential , due to the group of particle , has a minimum ; ( ii ) we determine the radius @xmath156 of a sphere , centered in @xmath155 , where the density contrast is @xmath157 ( we use the virial density contrast found in the absence of dark  dark coupling @xcite ) . taking all particles within @xmath156 we perform again the operations ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "the procedure is iterated until we converge onto a stable particle set .",
    "the set is discarded if , at some stage , we have less than @xmath153 particles . if a particle is a potential member of two groups it is assigned to the more massive one . in this work",
    "we use @xmath158 and take @xmath153 so to have a mass threshold @xmath159m@xmath50 .",
    "[ fig : mf ] shows the mass function for isolated halos for models with different values of @xmath25 and @xmath30 .",
    "let us remind that the simulations have the same initial phases and the same value @xmath37 .",
    "thus , the differences between models are only due to different couplings or @xmath160 .",
    "remarkably , at @xmath161 the mass - functions are practically indistinguishable : a mass - function has no  \" memory  \" of the past evolution . the mass - function obtained in this way",

    "[ fig : den ] and approaches -1 already at redshifts @xmath754 . as far as the state parameter is concerned , therefore , these models are quite close to @xmath9cdm and , in a sense , could be considered a variant of @xmath9cdm models , for which de is coupled to dm .    in spite of the lack of improvement for what concerns slopes ,",
    "n  body simulations lead to really significant results .",
    "first of all , the parameter space for coupled de models is restricted to couplings @xmath198 , however leaving a wide room for significant couplings .",
    "apart of the question of profiles , the halo mass function has been tested and found consistent with other de models and with observations . its evolution has been predicted and can be tested against future data . from this point of view , therefore , coupled de passed the non  linear test .    performing n ",
    "body simulations was also important to test the evolution of the _ bias _ , between baryon and dm fluctuations , which is one of the main characteristics of coupled de models at the linear level .",
    "here we showed that the bias still exists , and actually increases , in the non  linear structures and studied its evolution .",
    "these results are open to an accurate comparison with data , that shall be deepened elsewhere .",
    "let us however conclude these comments with a further observation .",
    "coupled de apparently leads to higher halo concentration essentially because of the evolution of the mass of dm particles and of the coupling constant between them . in the simulations we run ,",
    "such mass depends on time and gradually decreases , as is predicted by coupled de theories at the newtonian approximation level .",
    "accordingly , each dm particle mass was greater than today , in the past .",
    "its gravity was therefore stronger .",
    "this is the reason why , although normalizing all models to the same @xmath202 at @xmath161 , we produce more concentrated halos : the forces which bound them were stronger in the past than today .    after appreciating this point",
    ", one can tentatively propose a way out for the halo concentration problem : a coupled de model leading to dm particle masses which increase in time .",
    "this increase should also be fast enough to beat the higher gravity constant binding dm particels .",
    "this takes us back to the selection of a suitable self  interaction potential @xmath15 , which has no immediate obvious solution .",
    "this problem shall be therefore deepened in future work .",
