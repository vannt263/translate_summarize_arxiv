    "the in - sample model calibration starts in august 1 , 2007 and reaches to december 31 , 2011 .",
    "the considered high - frequency wind data exhibit several of the aforementioned wind speed characteristics .",

    "therefore , we primarily estimate the intercept , trend and the seasonal coefficients as well as the parameter @xmath54 for the generalised sine and cosine functions by generalised least squares estimation .",
    "these values are only used as starting values . in the next step",

    "moreover , it is related to the weight @xmath123 which model is the best method to make predictions of the wind power .",
    "in particular , the persistent model is a good benchmark for wind power prediction , but for our wind speed prediction , it is outperformed .",
    "an onshore wind park operator who is interested in a lower bound of wind power prediction has to use the second model .",
    "recent research has covered a wide range of wind speed forecasting approaches . in this paper ,",
    "two novel statistical approaches for high - frequency wind speed data are described .",
    "several extensions are implemented to cover the specific structure of the data set .",
    "the mean part takes annual and diurnal interactions into account .",
    "moreover , we distinguish between a first model with classical fourier series and a second model with p - generalised sine and cosine functions .",
    "the autocorrelation and the heteroscedasticity of both approaches is modeled by an arfima - aparch process with skew - t distributed residuals .",
    "the models are suitable to make three hour forecasts for wind speed and can be used for wind power prediction as well .    according to rmse and mae ,",
    "the developed approaches outperform common models .",
    "the generalised trigonometrical functions provide the smallest accuracy measures according to the three hour ahead forecasts .",
    "furthermore , we comprise the pce which provides ambiguous results .",
    "the overall pce provides the best results for the first model , if we consider a small weight .",
    "nevertheless , the second model derives the best results if the weight is @xmath136 or @xmath137 .",
    "finally , we remark that the pce is also depending on the previously specified turbine type . in this article , the models are applied to four stations situated at the german - polish border . for this reason ,",
    "the power production function of a fuhrlnder md 77 is used to calculate the pce .",
    "the fuhrlnder md 77 is a small turbine which is often used onshore , especially in plain regions in germany .",
    "the model robustness which is briefly discussed in the end , shows that some changes within the power curve function lead to different best prediction models .    in practice ,",
    "only the wind speed data set is needed .",
    "therefore , such a statistical wind speed prediction model is cost saving compared to other modelling approaches that require a set of possibly many more variables . clearly , there are further improvements of this approach possible .",
    "an idea is to analyse the variance in more detail and to consider meteorological regressors .",
    "finally , the wind speed model might include spatial informations .",
