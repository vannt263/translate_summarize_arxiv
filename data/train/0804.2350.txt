    "half a century ago johnson and teller  @xcite suggested the need for a scalar - isoscalar meson with a mass @xmath3 to provide saturation and binding in nuclei . in a way this was the starting point for one - boson - exchange ( obe ) potentials",
    "where , in addition to the pion , all possible resonances would be included  @xcite . despite their undeniable success describing nn scattering data ,",
    "there has always been some arbitrariness on the scalar meson mass and coupling constant to the nucleon , partly stimulated by a lack of other sources of information , definitely helping the fits .",
    "the relation of the ubiquitous scalar meson in nuclear physics and nn forces in terms of correlated two pion exchange has been pointed out many times  @xcite ( see e.g. @xcite for a discussion in a chiral context ) .    the quest for the existence of the @xmath4 resonance ( commonly denoted by @xmath5 ) has finally culminated with its inclusion in the pdg  @xcite as the @xmath6 seen as a @xmath2 resonance , where a spread of values ranging from @xmath7 for the mass and a @xmath8 for the width are displayed  @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties have recently been sharpened by a determination based on roy equations and chiral symmetry  @xcite yielding the value @xmath9 ; the lowest resonance in the hadronic spectrum .",
    "it is mandatory and perhaps possible to scrutinize its role in hadronic phenomenology all over . here ,",
    "we approach the problem from nn scattering in the @xmath1 channel from a renormalization viewpoint as applied to the obe potential ( without explicit inclusion of @xmath10 exchange ) and try to see the connection to @xmath2 scattering .",
    "the field theoretical obe model of the nn interaction  @xcite includes all mesons with masses below the nucleon mass , i.e. , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , in addition with a scalar - isoscalar boson . dropping @xmath12 and @xmath15 because of their small couplings , the @xmath16 nn potential is @xmath17 as is well known  @xcite any perturbative determination of a potential suffers from off - shell ambiguities ( even in the born approximation ) , particularly because of relativistic finite mass corrections which may be smoothly shifted between entirely energy dependent and local potentials or energy independent and nonlocal potentials .",
    "this trading between retardation and nonlocality may become sizable at short distances scales , where the interaction is unknown anyhow , and the particular choice is completely arbitrary",
    ". our renormalization scheme will be such that , as suggested by partovi and lomon we ignore both retardation and nonlocality in the long distance limit  @xcite , as well as the exponentially @xmath18 suppressed @xmath19 cut .",
    "relativistic effects are only kept by renormalization of the couplings , but the effect is small   and @xmath20 .    in any case , one should bear in mind that nn scattering in the elastic region below pion production threshold involves cm momenta @xmath21 mev .",
    "given the fact that @xmath22 we expect heavier mesons to be irrelevant , and @xmath23 itself to be marginally important , even in s - waves , which are most sensitive to short distances . in order to illustrate this , we take @xmath24mev , @xmath25mev , @xmath26mev and @xmath27 , which seem firmly established , and treat @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , as fitting parameters . as we show now",
    ", this vector meson irrelevance has not been fulfilled in the conventional approach to nn scattering , forcing too large @xmath31 couplings .",
    "actually , in the standard approach the scattering phase - shift @xmath32 is computed by solving the ( s - wave ) schrdinger equation * r*-space @xmath33 with a regular boundary condition at the origin @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , for a short range potential such as the one in eq .",
    "one also has the effective range expansion ( ere ) @xmath35 where the _ scattering length _ @xmath36 and the _ effective range _",
    "@xmath37 are defined by the asymptotic behavior of the zero energy wave function . in the usual approach",
    "@xcite everything is obtained from the potential assumed to be valid for @xmath38 .",
    "in addition , due to the _ unnaturally large _",
    "nn @xmath1 scattering length ( @xmath39 ) , any change in the potential @xmath40 has a dramatic effect on @xmath36 , since one obtains @xmath41 and thus the potential parameters _ must be fine tuned _ , and in particular the short distance physics .",
    "a fit to the np data of ref .",
    "@xcite yields two possible but incompatible scenarios : @xmath42mev , @xmath43 , @xmath44 with @xmath45 and @xmath46mev , @xmath47 , @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "the small errors should be noted .",
    "the ambiguity in this solution is a typical inverse scattering one ; note that despite the @xmath23 being repulsive , the total potential is not repulsive at short distances , and the corresponding couplings and scalar mass are determined to high accuracy but incompatible .",
    "this is just opposite to our expectations and we may regard these fits , despite their success in describing the data , as unnatural .",
    "to overcome the unphysical short distance sensitivity we implement the renormalization viewpoint ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the simplest version one proceeds as follows    * for a given @xmath36 integrate in the zero energy wave function @xmath50 down to the cut - off radius @xmath51 .",
    "this is the renormalization condition .",
    "@xmath52 * impose self - adjointness to get the finite energy wave function @xmath53 , @xmath54 * integrate out the finite energy wave function @xmath55 , eq .",
    ", to determine the phase shift @xmath32 from eq .  .",
    "* remove the cut - off @xmath56 to ensure _ model independence_.",
    "this procedure allows us to compute @xmath32 ( and hence the next order s parameters @xmath37 ,  @xmath57 ) from @xmath58 and @xmath36 as independent information .",
    "note that this is equivalent to consider , in addition to the regular solution , the irregular one .",

    "@xcite using the renormalization method gets @xmath59mev , @xmath60 , @xmath61 with @xmath62 .",
    "note that @xmath31 is , not only small but mostly irrelevant , so we consider this fit natural .",
    "a consequence of this is that we could take the su(3 ) value @xmath63 which on the basis of the ozi rule , @xmath64 , sakurai s universality @xmath65 and the ksfr relation @xmath66 yields @xmath67 for which we get @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 with a strong linear correlation ( see fig .
