    "instabilities of the magnetized shear flows play an important role in enhancing transport processes in various astrophysical bodies and laboratory experiments .",
    "shear flows are rather common in astrophysics , and the study of their stability properties is important for the understanding of many phenomena in stars , jets , accretion flows , galaxies , etc .",
    "likely , the best studied shear flow is differential rotation .",
    "it is well known since the classical papers by velikhov @xcite and chandrasekhar @xcite that a differentially rotating flow with a negative angular velocity gradient and a weak magnetic field can be subject to the magnetorotational instability .",
    "this instability has been analyzed in detail in several astrophysical contexts ( @xcite ) because it can be responsible for transport of the angular momentum in various objects . in accretion disks ,",
    "this instability is also well studied by numerical simulations in both linear and non - linear regimes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "astrophysical applications rise great interest in trying to study this instability in laboratory @xcite . the experiments , however , are complicated because very large rotation rates should be achieved .",
    "the plane couette flow is another example of shear flows well studied in laboratory conditions .",
    "the pioneering work on the stability of a magnetized plane couette flow has been done by velikhov @xcite who obtained that a longitudinal magnetic field with the strength @xmath2 has to stabilize the flow ; @xmath3 is the velocity in the center of the channel and @xmath4 is the fluid density .",
    "a sufficient condition of the ideal instability in a parallel magnetic field has been considered by chen & morrison @xcite .",
    "they argued that the magnetic field can provide a destabilizing effect such as the flow , which is stable in the absence of a magnetic field , can be driven unstable by a relatively weak magnetic field .",
    "also , they found that although strong magnetic shear can stabilize shear flow , there exist a range of magnetic shear that causes destabilization .",
    "the linear stability properties of dissipative shear flow in a parallel magnetic field have been considered by lerner & knobloch @xcite .",
    "the authors argued that misaligned linear perturbations can exhibit enhanced decay in such dissipative flows .",
    "stability of incompressible flow in a transverse magnetic field has been studied by takashima @xcite who found that there exist both the stationary and traveling modes of instability .",
    "note that many previous stability analyses have adopted the boussinesq approximation , and have therefore neglected the effect of compressibility .",
    "this is allowed if the magnetic field strength is essentially subthermal , and the sound speed is much greater than the alfvn velocity , @xmath5 but often this can not be realized in real astrophysical conditions and in many numerical simulations . as it was shown by bonanno & urpin @xcite , the compressibility profoundly alters the stability properties of shear flows .",
    "the number of new instabilities may occur in a compressible flow if the magnetic field has a component perpendicular to the flow .",
    "bonanno & urpin @xcite have considered the particular case of differentially rotating flows but , likely , the shear - driven instabilities are typical for other shear flows as well . in this paper , we show that the same sort of mhd instabilities can occur also in a plane couette flow if the magnetic field has a transverse component .",
    "the instability can arise even in a sufficiently strong magnetic field that suppresses other mhd instabilities .",
    "stability analysis done in this paper will hopefully prove to be a useful guide in understanding various numerical simulations that explore the nonlinear development of instabilities and their effects on the resulting turbulent state of shear flows .",
    "consider a plane couette flow with the velocity @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are the cartesian coordinates ; @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are the unit vectors . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we assume shear to be linear , @xmath13 , where @xmath3 and @xmath14 are constant .    we restrict ourselves to an inviscid fluid .",
    "the equations of compressible mhd read in this case @xmath15",
    "@xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 our notation is as follows : @xmath4 and @xmath20 are the density and fluid velocity , respectively ; @xmath21 is the gas pressure ; @xmath22 is the magnetic field , @xmath23 is the magnetic diffusivity , and @xmath24 is the adiabatic index ; @xmath25 is a scalar force introduced in order to provide hydrostatic equilibrium in the basic state . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", the flow is assumed to be isothermal .",
    "the basic state on which the stability analysis is performed is assumed to be quasi - stationary with the magnetic field that has non - vanishing components in all directions , @xmath26 .",
    "generally , a quasi - stationary basic state in such a magnetic shear flow can be achieved only if dissipative effects are taken into account . in the basic state",
    ", the magnetic field @xmath22 should satisfy the stationary induction equation @xmath27 since @xmath22 depends only on the @xmath9-coordinate , we have @xmath28 integrating this equation , we obtain @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are constant .",
    "we can choose the boundary conditions in such a way that @xmath32 that corresponds to the absence of electric currents at the low boundary @xmath33 .",
    "we will assume that the longitudinal magnetic field at the low boundary is much stronger than @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the thickness of the couette flow .",
    "then , @xmath36 , and one can neglect the change of @xmath37 across the basic flow when considering the behaviour of small perturbations .",
    "we assume also that the basic state satisfies the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium in the @xmath7- and @xmath9-directions . in the @xmath7-direction ,",
    "this condition is satisfied always . for the chosen magnetic field , hydrostatic equilibrium in the @xmath9-direction yields @xmath38 eq .",
    "( 9 ) can be satisfied if @xmath39const and the vertical component of the lorentz force is balanced by a scalar force in the basic state , @xmath40 note that , generally , there is no hydrostatic equilibrium in the @xmath8-direction in our model , but departures from equilibrium are small and can lead only to a very slow change of the basic state .",
    "for example , the lorenz force changes the basic velocity profile @xmath41 in accordance with the @xmath8-component of the momentum equation , @xmath42 where @xmath43 . integrating this expression ,",
    "we obtain @xmath44 the lorentz force changes essentially the initial velocity profile on the timescale @xmath45 ( we assume @xmath46 ) .",
    "therefore , one can neglect this departure from hydrostatic equilibrium if the growth rate of instability , @xmath47 , is greater than @xmath48 , or @xmath49 under this condition , the chosen basic state can be considered as quasi - stationary .",
    "we will show that this condition is satisfied in many cases of interest .",
    "we consider the stability of perturbations with the spacetime dependence @xmath50 .",
    "small perturbations will be indicated by subscript 1 , while unperturbed quantities will have no subscript .",
    "then , the linearized mhd - equations read @xmath51 \\nonumber \\\\ - \\frac{\\nabla p_{1}}{\\rho } \\ ! + \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\rho } [ ( \\nabla \\times \\vec{b}_{1 } ) \\times \\vec{b } + ( \\nabla \\times \\vec{b } ) \\times \\vec{b}_{1 } ] ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 this set of equations determines the behaviour of small perturbations .",
    "a general set of eqs .",
    "( 15)-(19 ) can be substantially simplified under our assumptions regarding the basic state .",
    "as it was mentioned , small departures from hydrostatic equilibrium in the basic state can not influence the behavior of perturbations if inequality ( 14 ) is satisfied .",
    "therefore , the term proportional to @xmath56 on the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( 15 ) can be neglected since it is proportional to small departures from hydrostatic equilibrium . from eq .",
    "( 19 ) , we have @xmath57 and , hence , @xmath58 .",
    "then , the @xmath7- , @xmath8- , and @xmath9-components of the momentum equation are @xmath59 eq .  ( 23 ) yields for the @xmath7- and @xmath8-components of the magnetic field @xmath60 combining now eqs .",

    "this equation can be solved easily since all coefficients are approximately constant in our model .",
    "to solve eq .",
    "( 25 ) , one needs the boundary conditions .",
    "note that the eigenvalues are not very sensitive to the boundary conditions .",
    "therefore , we choose the simplest model conditions and assume that @xmath65 at @xmath33 and @xmath66 .",
    "then , @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 is integer . from eq .",
    "( 25 ) , we have the following dispersion equation for the fundamental mode ( @xmath70 ) @xmath71 where @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 ; @xmath77 .",
    "this equation describes fast and slow magnetosonic waves modified by shear .",
    "the conditions under which eq .",
    "( 26 ) has unstable solutions can be obtained by making use of the routh - hurwitz theorem ( see @xcite , @xcite ) . in the case of the dispersion equation of a fourth order ,",
    "the routh - hurwitz criteria are written , for example , in @xcite . according to these criteria , eq .",
    "( 26 ) has unstable solutions if one of the following inequalities is fulfilled @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "two conditions ( 27 ) never apply because @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 are positive . in the limit of small magnetic diffusivity , eqs .",
    "( 28)-(29 ) are equivalent to @xmath83 that is the generalization of the condition derived by bonanno and urpin @xcite for differentially rotating flows .",
    "apart from shear , condition ( 30 ) requires non - vanishing @xmath8- and @xmath9-components of the magnetic field .",
    "the direction of @xmath22 and the sign of @xmath14 are insignificant , and the instability may occur for both positive and negative @xmath14 . note that the instability given by eq .",
    "( 30 ) can arise even in a very strong field .",
    "consider criteria ( 28)-(29 ) in the case when dissipation can not be neglected .",
    "condition ( 28 ) can be rewritten as @xmath84 as it was mentioned , our consideration is valid only if the condition @xmath85 is satisfied ( see eq .",
    "( 8) ) that is equivalent to @xmath86 since inequalities ( 31 ) and ( 32 ) are incompatible in the chosen longitudinal field , criterion ( 28 ) can not be fulfilled and , hence , @xmath87 .    since @xmath88 in the considered flow",
    ", we can transform criterion ( 29 ) into @xmath89 taking into account eq .",
    "( 32 ) , we can estimate @xmath90 .",
    "then , the last term on the l.h.s .",
    "is of the order of @xmath91 and can be neglected compared to the second term .",
    "hence , criterion ( 33 ) is approximately equivalent to @xmath92 this condition can be fulfilled only if @xmath93 that is the necessary condition of instability . in accordance with this condition",
    ", the imposed longitudinal field should have the same direction as the field stretched from @xmath94 .",
    "if inequality ( 35 ) is satisfied , then the instability arises if @xmath95 , or @xmath96 this inequality can be fulfilled in a wide variety of strongly magnetized flows where the magnetic pressure is greater than the thermal pressure .",
    "( 35 ) and ( 36 ) determine the necessary and sufficient conditions of shear - driven instability in a couette flow .",

    "( 35 ) , we consider the roots of eq .",

    "( 26 ) ( see @xcite , for details ) .",
    "moreover it is not difficult to see that in order to satisfy the constrain eq.(8 ) we must choose @xmath101 .",

    "one unstable root is rather large with the growth rate @xmath110 , and another one is typically about 10 times smaller . for these roots ,",
    "the growth rate varies very slowly with the parameter @xmath102",
    ". only if the alfven frequency is smaller than the characteristic shear frequency and @xmath111 , the growth rate of the most unstable mode decreases .",

    "the right panel shows the behavior of roots at the top left region of the left panel where roots are small . comparing with fig .",
    "1 , it is seen that a decrease of the ratio @xmath119 results naturally in a smaller growth rate .",
    "this dependence is qualitatively clear since the considered instability is due to the presence of a transverse field component in a flow and , therefore , a decrease of this component leads to a weaker instability . in the considered range of @xmath102 , both oscillatory and non - oscillatory",
    "modes can arise .",
    "two non - oscillatory modes are unstable if @xmath120 . after merging ,",
    "this couple forms a pair of complex conjugate modes that are unstable if @xmath121 . the growth rate of one non - oscillatory is larger than that of oscillatory modes and can reach @xmath122 .",

    "we show only three roots in this figure since the fourth root has a large negative value , @xmath128 .",

    "after merging at @xmath131 , these real roots form a couple of complex conjugate roots that are unstable at @xmath132 .",

    "5 shows the growth rate of instability for a very small value of @xmath136 .",
    "this @xmath137 corresponds to the magnetic pressure approximately three orders of magnitude greater than the gas pressure . despite a very high magnetic pressure",
    ", the instability can still occur .",
    "this is in an agreement with our analytic result that the instability should not be suppressed by a strong magnetic field .",
    "the dependences in fig",
    ".  5 are qualitatively very similar to those shown in fig .",
    "two non - oscillatory modes are unstable in this case as well .",
    "one unstable mode has a very small growth rate @xmath122 , but another one grows much faster , @xmath138 .",
    "the growth rate of the fastest growing mode is even higher than in the case @xmath108 despite a strong magnetic field .",
    "to summarize then , we have considered the instability caused by shear in a compressible magnetized gas . to illustrate the main qualitative features of the instability associated to compressibility and shear",
    ", we analyzed a particular case of perturbations that depend on the vertical coordinate alone .",
    "the plane couette flow with a non - vanishing transverse magnetic field turns out to be unstable even in this simplest case .",
    "the necessary condition of instability is @xmath139 , and it can be easily satisfied in laboratory flows . since the shear flow in the presence of a transverse magnetic field always stretches the longitudinal field satisfying the necessary condition ( 35 ) , one can expect that the instability likely operates if @xmath140 is entirely generated by shear and @xmath141 in eq .",
    "we consider this case elsewhere .",
    "the newly found instability is relatively slow : its growth rate reaches @xmath142 and is small compared to the shear timescale , @xmath143 .",
    "however , even this growth rate can be sufficient to generate hydrodynamic motions in many real flows , for example , in astrophysics . basically , the growth rate is larger for non - oscillatory modes which are unstable at relatively not very large @xmath102 .",
    "the growth rate depends on the ratio of the magnetic and gas pressure , being smaller for a low ratio .",
    "the considered instability is related basically to shear and compressible properties of a magnetized gas . in the incompressible limit that corresponds to @xmath144",
    ", we have from eq .  ( 26 ) @xmath145 and the instability does not occur for the chosen perturbations .",
    "it can be not the case , however , for perturbations of a more general form which depend also on the @xmath7- or @xmath8-coordinates",
    ".    this new instability can be either oscillatory or non - oscillatory , depending on the value of the ratio @xmath146 .",
    "typically , the considered instability is non - oscillatory if @xmath102 is not large and oscillatory in the opposite case .",
    "the critical @xmath102 that determines the transition between oscillatory and non - oscillatory regimes depends strongly on the parameters @xmath129 , @xmath113 , and @xmath137 and can vary within a wide range .",
    "one more important feature of the instability is associated with the dependence on the magnetic field strength .",
    "generally , a sufficiently strong magnetic field can suppress instabilities of a shear flow . on the contrary",
    ", the instability discovered in our study can not be suppressed even in very strong magnetic fields as it is seen from the criterion ( 40 ) .",
    "all this comparison allows us to claim that our analysis demonstrates the presence of the new instability in compressible shear flows .",
