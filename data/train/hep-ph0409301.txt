    "the production of electron - positron pairs under the action of electromagnetic field ( schwinger effect ) attracts great attention because it is a nonlinear effect that lies beyond the limits of perturbation theory .",
    "the study of this effect can shed light on the nonlinear properties of the quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) vacuum .",
    "this effect was first predicted for the case of a constant electric field more than 60 years ago @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that a plane electromagnetic wave can not produce electron - positron pairs because both its electromagnetic invariants , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , are equal to zero .",
    "for this reason this effect was first considered in the case of a constant electric field , in which case the first invariant @xmath0 does not vanish .",
    "later , this analysis was extended to the case of a spatially homogeneous time - varying electric field @xcite , but these results were long believed to be of academic interest only , because the power of the laser systems available at that time was far below the limit for pair production to become experimentally observable@xcite . however the recent development of laser technology has resulted in the increase of the power of optical and infrared lasers by many orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "presently , lasers systems are available that can deliver pulses with intensities of the order of @xmath2 w/@xmath3 in the focal spot",
    ". such intensities are still much smaller than the characteristic intensity for pair production @xmath4 w/@xmath3 , which corresponds , for a laser pulse with wavelength @xmath5 , to an electric field equal to the critical schwinger field @xmath6 v / cm",
    ". nevertheless , there are projects that aim to reach intensities as high as @xmath7 w/@xmath3 already in the coming decade .",
    "in addition , several methods for reaching the critical intensity with presently available systems have been proposed recently .",
    "one of these schemes was demonstrated in the experiments at slac where @xmath8 w/@xmath3 laser photons , back - scattered by a @xmath9 gev electron beam , interacted with the laser pulse and several electron - positron pairs were detected @xcite .",
    "another scheme for reaching critical intensities was suggested in ref.@xcite , where the interaction of the laser pulse with electron density modulations in a plasma , produced by a counterpropagating breaking wake plasma wave , results in the frequency up - shift and pulse focusing . in this",
    "scheme intensities of the order of the critical density can be obtained using @xmath8 w/@xmath3 laser pulses .",
    "hence , a more detailed study of the schwinger effect in time - varying electromagnetic fields and of all the processes that accompany it has become an urgent physical problem from an experimental point of view also .    the process of electron - positron pair production by electromagnetic fields that are solutions of the maxwell equations in a plasma and in vacuum was studied recently in refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that already for intensities of the laser pulse smaller than the critical intensity , the energy loss due to pair production is of the same order of the energy storied in the pulse .",
    "therefore it is no longer possible to consider the electromagnetic field in the pulse as an external field and the energy loss by the electromagnetic field due to pair production and particle acceleration must be taken into account .",
    "the problem of the backreaction of the produced particles on the background field was discussed extensively in a number of papers on the particle formation process in high energy hadronic interactions @xcite as well as under the action of electric fields @xcite . in the former case",
    "this process can be viewed as the quantum tunneling of quark - antiquark and gluon pairs in the presence of the background color - electric field of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "such a color field is formed between two receding nuclei which are color charged by the exchange of soft gluons at the time of collision .",
    "this leads to the formation of a very strong color - electric field and , hence , to more copious pair production .",
    "it was understood that , in solving a dynamical problem with a strong initial electric field , the effect of the produced particles on the electric field ( the back reaction ) should be taken into consideration .",
    "the quark - gluon plasma emerging through tunneling in nucleus - nucleus collisions will change the color - electric field due to the appearance of conduction and polarization currents .",
    "the first current is due to the particle motion in the field while the latter arises from the process of pair creation .",
    "a kinetic equation coupled to maxwell equations was used to solve this problem .",
    "the pair production process was considered as if occurring in qed , and the color - electric field was assumed to be abelian , spatially homogeneous and time - dependent .",
    "however a spatially homogeneous time dependent electric field is not a solution of maxwell equations in vacuum .",
    "we also note that in refs.@xcite special attention was paid to the properties of the emerging plasma , while the properties of the background field were not studied in detail .    in the present paper",
    ", we consider the process of electron - positron pair production in a cold collisionless plasma , under the action of an electromagnetic field which is an actual solution of the maxwell equations , as well as the backreaction of the produced pairs on the background field . in doing so we use the boltzmann - vlasov equation , with a source term obtained from the pair production rate @xcite . in order to elucidate the role of the magnetic field component on the electron - positron pair production , we consider a planar , circularly polarized , electromagnetic wave propagating in an underdense collisionless plasma ( for the sake of simplicity we consider an electron - positron plasma ) . in the case of a plane wave in a plasma the first field",
    "invariant @xmath0 is not equal to zero due to the different dispersion equation with respect to that in vacuum .",
    "therefore , in a plasma , electron - positron pairs can be produced by a plane electromagnetic wave , as was shown in ref.@xcite . in this case a lorentz transformation to the reference frame moving with the group velocity @xmath10 of the wave transforms the electromagnetic field into a purely electric field , that rotates with constant frequency , and with no associated magnetic field .",
    "although this transformation reduces the problem under consideration to the situation where the pairs are produced by a time - varying electric field , the effects of the wave magnetic field are incorporated rigorously into our model .",
    "we notice that a similar approach was used earlier in ref.@xcite .",
    "however in this latter paper a linearly polarized electromagnetic wave was considered and an approximation was adopted that is only valid in the limit of a small amplitude electromagnetic field .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the effect on the background wave in the plasma caused by the pairs produced by the wave through their polarization and conduction currents .",
    "in particular , by considering the interaction between the wave and the plasma as an initial value problem in the moving frame , we study the evolution of the wave electromagnetic field . due to the nonlinear properties of the equations governing the field evolution in time , we find a strong nonlinear dependence of wave field properties on the wave initial amplitude .",
    "we find a nonlinear up - shift of the wave frequency , a change of its polarization state and damping of its amplitude . in order to exemplify these effects ,",
    "we consider two limiting cases of the electric field evolution . in the first limit the amplitude of the initial electric field",
    "is assumed to be so large that most of the electron - positron pairs are produced instantaneously .",
    "this leads to an instantaneous change of the electric field amplitude and frequency .",
    "in the second limit we consider a regime where the pair production rate is relatively small , so that all parameters of the wave change slowly . in this case",
    "we see the wave amplitude damp with time .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[rs ] we review some well known properties of a strong electromagnetic wave in a plasma . in sec.[kd ] we study the equations governing the process of pair production and the evolution of the electromagnetic wave . in secs.[l1],[l2 ] we consider two limiting cases : fast changing field and slow changing field .",
    "the main results and conclusions are presented in sec.[cc ] .",
    "first we recover the properties of a relativistically strong electromagnetic wave propagating in an underdense collisionless electron - positron plasma that are needed in order to determine the form of the time varying electric field .",
    "this discussion is based on the results obtained by akhiezer and polovin in ref .",
    "we consider a circularly polarized electromagnetic wave , propagating in an electron - positron plasma . in the following we use the @xmath11 and @xmath12 convention .",
    "an electromagnetic wave propagating in a plasma has a group velocity smaller than the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "thus it is possible to make a transformation to the reference frame moving with the wave group velocity @xmath10 . in this frame",
    "the magnetic field of the wave vanishes and its time - varying electric field is spatially homogeneous and is thus governed by the equation @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the positron ( electron ) distribution function , normalized such that @xmath17 gives the number @xmath18 of electrons or positrons per unit volume , and @xmath19 is their electric charge with @xmath20 for the positrons and @xmath21 for the electrons .",
    "we consider the case of an electrically quasineutral plasma , where the density of positrons is equal to the density of electrons , @xmath22 , with @xmath23 the density in the moving frame .",
    "if we assume that the plasma is cold , i. e. , that the particle distribution function of the species @xmath24 can be written as @xmath25 , the system of equations for the electric field evolution in the moving frame reduces to @xmath26 we assume symmetric initial conditions , so that the positron and the electron momenta @xmath27 perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the laser pulse have opposite signs and equal absolute value , @xmath28 , while they have equal parallel momentum @xmath29 . here",
    "the non zero value @xmath30 of the parallel momentum is due to the lorentz transformation from the laboratory to the moving frame and @xmath31 .",
    "then , we find for the particle momentum @xmath32 the equation @xmath33 the solution of this equation is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the vector - potential , @xmath36 and @xmath37 ^{1/2}\\ ] ] is the langmuir frequency which enters the dispersion equation of an electromagnetic wave propagating in a plasma .",
    "the wave is propagating along z - axis . in this moving frame the wave electric field is given by @xmath38 in the laboratory frame the wave dispersion equation is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 can be re - expressed in terms of the electron and positron densities @xmath41 and of the particle energy @xmath42 in the laboratory frame as @xmath43 ^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "the phase and group velocities of a nonlinear electromagnetic wave in a plasma depend on the plasma parameters and on the wave amplitude . from eq.([de ] ) we find that the phase velocity @xmath44 and the group velocity @xmath45 , are related according to equation @xmath46 . in the laboratory frame",
    "the electric and the magnetic fields are given by @xmath47,\\ ] ] @xmath48,\\ ] ] respectively , with @xmath49 the time in the laboratory frame .",
    "we see that in a plasma the first invariant of the electromagnetic field @xmath50 is not equal to zero and is given by @xmath51 it vanishes when the plasma density tends to zero , i. e. , in vacuum . in the following",
    "we shall use the notation @xmath52 .",
    "we consider the propagation of a circularly polarized electromagnetic wave in an underdense collisionless plasma in the reference frame moving with the wave group velocity @xmath53 .",
    "the relativistic kinetic equation @xmath54 describes the dependence on time and momentum of the distribution function @xmath55 in this moving frame where a spatially homogeneous electric field @xmath56 is present . the source term in eq.([kinetic ] )",
    "is proportional to the quasiclassical probability @xmath57 . \\label{tun}\\ ] ] of tunneling through the gap between the lower and the upper continuum of electron energy spectrum in the presence of the electric field .",
    "we note that the form of eq.([tun ] ) corresponds to the case of constant field @xcite . however , the characteristic time of pair production @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is electron compton wavelength , is negligible with respect to the wave period .",
    "this estimate gives a lower bound on the pair production time while the estimate that follows from the quasiclassical approximation gives for the time of sub - barrier motion @xmath60 @xcite , where @xmath61 is the dimensionless amplitude of vector - potential .",
    "however , for @xmath62 ( the case we are considering ) , even this estimate yields a pair production time much shorter than the wave period .",
    "thus , it is possible to use eq.([tun ] ) for the time - varying electric field with time playing the role of a parameter .",
    "in addition , following the reasoning of refs .",
    "@xcite , we assume that the pairs are produced at rest , i. e. the momentum distribution of the source term is taken to be proportional to the dirac delta function @xmath63 \\delta \\left ( \\mathbf{p}\\right ) .",
    "\\label{source}\\ ] ] this assumption is reinforced by the fact that the momentum distribution in eq.([tun ] ) has a width @xmath64 which is negligible with respect to the momentum that electrons ( positrons ) acquire in the electric field . here",
    "@xmath65 is the normalized electric field and @xmath66 is the critical schwinger field .",
    "the source term has been normalized in such way that @xmath67 gives the number @xmath68\\exp [ -\\pi m^{2}/ee]$ ] of positrons ( electrons ) produced according to schwinger s formula .",
    "we solve eq.([kinetic ] ) by integrating it along the particle characteristics .",
    "the equations for the characteristics for each species @xmath24 are @xmath69 introducing the function @xmath70 , we obtain @xmath71 as a result the distribution function is given by the following expression @xmath72+\\int\\limits_{0}^{t}q_{\\alpha } \\{\\mathbf{p}_{\\bot } + e_{\\alpha } [ \\mathbf{a}(t)-\\mathbf{a}(t^{\\prime } ) ] , t^{\\prime } \\}dt^{\\prime } ,   \\label{f}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the distribution function of the initial plasma positrons ( electrons ) before the passage of the electromagnetic wave .",
    "let us assume that at the initial time @xmath74 the plasma is cold so that @xmath75 where we recall that @xmath76 is the component of the particle momentum parallel to the electromagnetic wave propagation and @xmath77 is its initial value which arises from the lorentz transformation from the laboratory to the moving frame .",

    "such large values of the longitudinal momentum of electrons ( positrons ) in the laboratory frame are due to the transverse acceleration of electrons ( positrons)in the moving frame . performing the lorentz transformation back to the laboratory frame we obtain for the longitudinal momentum in the laboratory frame of the initial electrons and positrons @xmath96\\approx \\gamma_g v_g |\\mathbf{a}|$ ] where we used @xmath97 .    in summary",
    ", the production of electron - positron pairs by the electromagnetic wave propagation in the plasma leads to the up - shifting of the wave frequency and to the damping of the wave amplitude and changes the polarization state of the wave . in order to illustrate these effects analytically , we consider two limiting cases of the electric field evolution , which can be clearly distinguished on the basis of the results shown in fig",
    "first , we will consider the case of a fast changing field when the initial electric field amplitude is so large that the most of the electron - positron pairs is produced instantly .",
    "this case can be illustrated by the results shown in fig . 1c .",
    "then , we will consider the case of a slowly changing field , when the pair production rate is relatively small and all the parameters of the wave change slowly as illustrated in fig .",
    "we assume that the amplitude of the initial electric field is so large that the electron - positron pair production and the consequent change of the properties of the wave electric field occur almost instantaneously . in this case",
    "we may approximate the time dependence of the source term as @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the initial amplitude of the electric field and @xmath100 is a characteristic time defined so that the total number @xmath101 of pairs produced is kept constant and given by @xmath102}$ ] per compton 3-volume @xmath103 .",
    "then , it is possible to carry out the integration over @xmath104 in the r.h.s . of eq.([maxwell ] ) . as a result",

    "the main part of the pair production has already taken place when the amplitude of the field has been reduced so that it is no longer capable of producing a significant amount of pairs .",
    "therefore the values @xmath108 that enter the r.h.s . of eq.([fast ] ) should be considered as referring to the vector potential and to the electric field at the instant when the pairs are created . from these values",
    "we can deduce the value of @xmath107 using energy conservation and taking into account the polarization current .    in order to understand the basic properties of the electric field evolution described by eq.([fast ] ) , it is convenient to linearize it . to do so",

    "we assume that the pair production rate is small , so that the parameters of the electromagnetic wave change slowly .",
    "then , we can neglect @xmath117 with respect to @xmath118 , since , as the wave amplitude decreases with time , @xmath117 becomes increasingly small compared to @xmath118 .",

    "( [ slow3 ] ) and set the pair production rate equal to constant , we obtain @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 is the electric field amplitude averaged over the field evolution .",
    "the equations for the two components of the vector - potential are decoupled and thus the polarization state is preserved .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( [ slow3 ] ) is @xmath123 where the frequencies @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) are the roots of the third order polynomial equation @xmath126 and the constants @xmath127 are determined by the initial conditions .",
    "it is obvious from the form of the polynomial equation that one of its roots is imaginary and positive , while the other two are complex .",
    "the two terms in the solution with complex frequencies describe a damped wave , while the third term corresponds to a spurious , exponentially growing , term that can be excluded by an appropriate choice of the initial conditions .",
    "in the present paper we considered the problem of the backreaction of the produced electron - positron pairs on the electromagnetic wave .",
    "we showed that there is a loss of wave energy due to the pair production and acceleration of these pairs in the electromagnetic field of the wave .",
    "we studied the propagation of a relativistically strong electromagnetic wave in an underdense electron - positron plasma .",
    "as is well known , a plane wave does not produce electron - positron pairs in vacuum .",
    "however the situation changes in a plasma . due to the fact that in plasma the first field invariant @xmath128 does not vanish ,",
    "a plane wave can produce pairs that backreact on the wave . in order to describe the behaviour of the electrons and positrons",
    ", we adopted a kinetic plasma description and used the relativistic boltzmann - vlasov equation . solving this equation we obtained the distribution functions of electrons and positrons which we used to derive the current density that enters the r.h.s .",
    "of maxwell equation for the electric field .",
    "we note that all the calculations were carried out in the reference frame moving with the group velocity of the wave . in this frame",
    "there is no magnetic field as the wave has only an electric field .",
    "the solutions of the maxwell equation for the evolution of the electric field in the plasma for different initial amplitudes are shown in fig .",
    "we see that , when the process of electron - positron pair production is taken into account , the evolution of the vector - potential in the plasma leads to the damping of the wave , accompanied by a nonlinear shift of its frequency .",
    "the damping of the vector - potential is due to the pair production which takes away a portion of the wave energy .",
    "this process is followed by the increase of plasma density which leads to the up - shifting of the wave frequency .",
    "the damping of the vector - potential amplitude , together with its frequency increase , gives rise to an interesting phenomenon  the decrease of the wave amplitude followed by the increase of its frequency .",
    "pair production decreases the wave amplitude while the growth of plasma density all over the space causes the increase of the wave frequency which is proportional to square root of the density .",
    "this effect resembles the case when the electromagnetic wave propagates in an ionizing medium @xcite .",
    "since the pair production rate depends on the field amplitude exponentially , an unbalanced damping of the field components occurs and leads to the change of the wave polarization ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . one can clearly see the change of the electric field polarization from circular to elliptic and the decrease of one of the two electric field components .    finally , we considered two limiting cases in order to identify the properties and the exact causes of this nonlinear behaviour of the wave . in the first case",
    "the initial amplitude of the electric field is so large that the pair production and the change of the wave properties occur instantaneously . in the second case",
    "the pair production rate is small so that the properties of the wave change slowly .",
    "in first case we obtain an electric field oscillating with a new frequency and amplitude .",
    "the frequency increase is due to the fact that the density of plasma increases because of the pair production . in the second case",
    "we obtain a damped wave with an amplitude that decreases slowly with time .",
    "we see that the process of electron - positron pair production leads to the damping of the wave .",
    "there is a nonlinear shift of its frequency due to the decrease of its amplitude : as a result the frequency is up - shifted .",

    "this work was supported in part by the russian fund for fundamental research under projects 03 - 02 - 17348 , the federal program of the russian ministry of industry , science and technology grant no 40.052.1.1.1112 .",
    "the form of the polarization current can be derived from the energy - conservation law . in order to calculate the expression for the polarization current",
