    "magnetic shape memory heusler alloys are promising materials for magnetic cooling and actuation applications due to their large inverse magnetocaloric effect@xcite and magnetic field induced strains@xcite related to the martensitic transformation ( mt ) .",
    "epitaxial thin films of these alloys are an ideal model system to study e.g. the martensitic microstructure @xcite or interface effects @xcite . however , a good model system should exhibit bulk - like behavior and as little substrate influence as possible .",
    "usually , a single crystalline substrate leads to some amount of residual austenite at the interface and thus an incomplete mt in the epitaxial film .",
    "@xcite    in this work the influence of different underlayer materials on the mt of epitaxial ni - co - mn - al thin films has been investigated .",
    "the structure of ni - co - mn - al in the martensitic phase is _",
    "_ l__1@xmath4 and in the austenitic phase _ _ b__2 .",
    "@xcite    the considered underlayers are single crystalline mgo(001 ) and mgal@xmath5o@xmath6(001 ) substrates , and mgo(001)/v(35 nm ) seed layer structures , which exhibit a lattice misfit @xmath7 between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "ni - co - mn - al thin film samples were prepared by magnetron co - sputtering in an ultrahigh vacuum system with a base pressure of @xmath8 mbar . during deposition",
    "the substrates were heated to @xmath9c and rotated at @xmath10rpm .",
    "on top of the heusler film a @xmath11 nm si capping layer was deposited . in order to find the optimum substrate and seed layer for this shape memory heusler compound ,",
    "the following combinations were examined : mgo / ni - co - mn - al , mgal@xmath5o@xmath6/ni - co - mn - al , and mgo / v / ni - co - mn - al .",
    "this choice is based on the low lattice mismatch below 4% between the underlayer and the heusler alloy .",
    "the substrate materials are mgo and mgal@xmath5o@xmath6 single crystals with ( 001 ) surface .",
    "the thickness of the ni - co - mn - al films and the v seed layer were ascertained by x - ray reflectometry measurements to be @xmath12 nm and 35 nm , respectively .",
    "the composition was determined to be ni@xmath13co@xmath14mn@xmath15al@xmath16 for all films by x - ray fluorescence spectroscopy and energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy measurements .",
    "structural characterization was done by x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) measurements in bragg brentano geometry using cu k@xmath17 radiation .",
    "for the temperature dependent measurements a custom built ln@xmath5 cryostat with a temperature range from 120k to 470k was used . in order to start these measurements in the austenite phase all temperature dependent measurements",
    "were started at 470k .",
    ", ( 004)@xmath18 , ( 400)@xmath19 peaks . ]    figure [ fig1](a ) shows the room temperature xrd patterns of the investigated films .",
    "visible are the ( 002)@xmath20 and ( 004)@xmath21 and ( 002)@xmath22 peaks at 42.9@xmath23 , 44.8@xmath23 , and 60.8@xmath23 , respectively .",
    "further , the austenite peaks ( 002)@xmath18 and ( 004)@xmath18 are visible at 30.8@xmath23 and 64.2@xmath23 .",
    "martensite peaks ( 200)@xmath19 and ( 400)@xmath19 are found at 32.7@xmath23 and 68.4@xmath23 .",
    "this indicates that all investigated films consist of a mixture of austenite and martensite at room temperature .",
    "using further measurements employing a 4-circle goniometer it was verified that the v layer grows epitaxially on the mgo and the ni - co - mn - al film grows epitaxially on all three underlayers with the same in - plane crystallographic orientation : the [ 100]@xmath18 and [ 100]@xmath22 direction are parallel to each other and to the [ 110 ] direction of the mgo or mgal@xmath5o@xmath6 substrate .    the temperature dependence of the ( 002)@xmath22 , ( 004)@xmath18 , ( 400)@xmath19 peaks is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) for the mgo / v / ni - co - mn - al sample . at 470k",
    "the film is fully austenitic , which is seen from the absence of the ( 400)@xmath19 reflection .",
    "this peak grows with decreasing temperature while the ( 004)@xmath18 peak decreases . at 170k",
    "the integrated intensity of the ( 004)@xmath18 peak is 15% of the initial value at high temperature .",
    "the full temperature dependence of the integrated intensity of the ( 004)@xmath18 peak is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) for all investigated films for heating and cooling .",
    "we take the intensity of the ( 004)@xmath18 reflection as a measure for the austenite fraction of the film and conclude that for the film on mgo / v , a fraction of 15% of the ni - co - mn - al film does not transform to martensite and remains at low temperature as residual austenite . for comparison , the film on mgal@xmath5o@xmath6 exhibits 39% of residual austenite and that one on mgo 33% .",
    "it is therefore evident that the amount of residual austenite depends on the choice of the substrate .",
    "peak is taken as a measure for the phase fraction of austenite . in ( a )",
    "the the transformations are shown on the same y - axis and in ( b ) an overlay is generated by different y - axis for each film .",
    "the arrow indicates the direction of temperature change .",
    "the amount of residual austenite depends on the underlayer , but the temperature interval of the transformation does not . ]    from an overlay of the three hysteresis curves ( cf .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ) it is evident that the martensitic forward and reverse transformation occurs at approximately the same temperature for all samples , and hence , the choice of the substrate material does not significantly influence the transformation temperatures .",
    ".[tab1]lattice constants , misfit , and young s modulus of different substrates .",
    "the value for v is the average in - plane lattice constant as determined by xrd .",
    "out - of - plane , 3.05  was found . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the lattice constants of the austenite , the substrates , and v seed layer are presented in tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] . from this",
    ", it seems that a low lattice mismatch between austenite and underlayer is not preferred for a well performing shape memory thin film .",
    "instead , the best results are obtained for the highest lattice mismatch of 3.6% .",
    "possibly , during film growth in the austenite state , the difference in lattice parameter is compensated by misfit dislocations , which can act as nucleation centers for martensitic nuclei close to the substrate and support a complete martensitic transformation .",
    "however , it is also seen that the amount of residual austenite only slightly differs between mgal@xmath5o@xmath6 and mgo where the difference in lattice constant is rather large , but strongly drops from mgo to v. so , it is assumed that the lattice mismatch is not the only influence on the transformation .",
    "the habit planes in shape memory heusler alloys are close to @xmath24 planes @xcite and thus , finite size ( 001 ) interfaces between martensite and the substrate are not possible without local deformations of the lattice .",
    "therefore , it seems plausible that the elastic modulus of the substrate plays a role for the mt of the shape memory alloy close to the substrate .        to elucidate this ,",
    "the dependence of the young s modulus ( @xmath25 ) of the substrates and seed layer on the amount of residual austenite is presented in fig .",
    "since ascertaining the direction of the stress at the interface is difficult , the elastic constant for polycrystalline bulk is considered .",
    "vanadium is by far the softest of the studied underlayer materials and allows the most complete mt .",
    "furthermore , it is visible from fig.[fig1](b ) , that the ( 002)@xmath22 peak broadens during the mt of the heusler layer . it also decreases and shifts to higher scattering angles .     peak change significantly during the mt of the ni - co - mn - al film on top and exhibit a hysteresis .",
    "the black curves in all figure parts ( right axis ) show the mt of the ni - co - mn - al layer , see fig .",
    "the v out - of - plane lattice parameter ( c ) shows slight deviation from linearity and no hysteresis . ]    a detailed analysis of the ( 002)@xmath22 peak is given in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . here",
    ", the peak height , fwhm , and the average out - of - plane lattice constant corresponding to the peak position are compared to the hysteresis of the mt of the ni - co - mn - al ( black curve , right axis ) . the peak height ( fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) ) decreases and the fwhm ( fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ) increases during the mt of the heusler layer and both quantities exhibit a hysteresis .",
    "this peak broadening indicates that the coherent scattering length is reduced , possibly by microstrains , caused by the mt .",
    "it is striking that the change of the v peak on the cooling branch is nearly jointly with the forward mt , but on the heating branch , the reverse mt needs more overheating than the relaxation of the v buffer .",
    "the reason for this is that the v layer does not undergo a phase transformation , but is elastically deformed . upon heating ,",
    "when the martensite becomes unstable , the restoring force leads to relaxation of the v , which probably causes some reverse transformation of the ni - co - mn - al close to the v layer , while the bulk of the heusler film needs further overheating for a complete transformation .",
    "however , the average out - of - plane lattice constant of the v buffer ( fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) ) shows only slight deviations from linearity during heating and cooling ( thermal expansion ) and no significant hysteresis .",
    "so , in order to elucidate the local changes of the v lattice constant caused by the mt of the heusler layer , further measurements with high spacial resolution , employing e.g. temperature dependent high - resolution transmission electron microscopy , are needed .",
    "lastly , it is noted that we produced similar ni - co - mn - al films on mgo / cr substrates ( cr : @xmath26 , @xmath27gpa@xcite ) , with a lattice mismatch of only @xmath28 . in that film",
    ", no mt occurs due to interdiffusion between the cr seed layer and the ni - co - mn - al film caused by the high deposition temperature .",
    "deposition at lower temperature ( 300@xmath23c ) leads to a partial mt ( @xmath29 ) but the results are not shown here because of impaired comparability to the other samples due to different preparation conditions .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the the martensitic transformation of epitaxial ni - co - mn - al films in dependence of the underlayer elasticity and lattice misfit .",
    "we find that an underlayer with small positive lattice misfit to the austenite is preferred for a complete martensitic transformation .",
    "furthermore , an elastic underlayer is strained during the mt in the film .",
    "the transformation temperatures are not significantly influenced by the substrate .",
    "based on the presented results , v is identified as a good seed layer material for shape memory heusler alloys .      99 n. teichert , d. kucza , o. yildirim , e. yuzuak , i. dincer , a. behler , b. weise , l. helmich , a. boehnke , s. klimova , a. waske , y. elerman , and a. htten , phys . rev .",
