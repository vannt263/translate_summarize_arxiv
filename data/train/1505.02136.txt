    "<S> the large value of @xmath90 means that only a negligible fraction of energy dissipation comes from vortex core rotation . </S>",

    "<S> an important virtue of this model is that based on our calculations of @xmath90 and @xmath117 , eq.([e.gefdteusdb ] ) predicts the time scale @xmath125 of several minutes . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ e.gefdteusdb ] ) gives a simple explanation for the observed slow mode @xcite , which remained unexplained in previous models @xcite .    in summary </S>",

    "<S> we predicted a lifshitz transition , which separates low - energy quasiparticle states at the half cores and affects the rotational dynamics . applying our results to ref . </S>",
