    "in recent years , much work has been devoted to understand energy flow and transport properties in the context of open quantum systems @xcite .",

    "are often described within the so - called born - markov approximation @xcite , many of such systems clearly show memory effects during the dynamics . moreover ,",
    "many of the earlier studies still stick to the weak coupling assumption , usually necessary to derive a closed master equation for the statistical operator of the reduced system .    in this work",
    ", we consider the energy exchange dynamics in non - driven open cv systems using full counting statistics methods , referring to a recently introduced measure of energy backflow @xcite , which quantifies the total amount of energy flowing back to the system from the heat bath . in particular , we calculate it for a model of quantum brownian motion ( qbm ) both in the weak coupling regime , using an analytic approach , and in the strong coupling regime by employing a numerical strategy based on exact diagonalization of a large but finite heat bath . in this context , we study the role of coupling strength , temperature and cut - off frequency in the behavior of the energy backflow measure .",
    "we also separately consider the dynamics of the energies of system , bath and interaction for different regimes of coupling strength , showing a qualitative change in the dynamics when moving to the strong coupling regime .",
    "finally , we show that , in the considered range of parameters , the reduced dynamics is indeed non - markovian by using a recently introduced witness which is based on the non - monotonicity of gaussian interferometric power , which in turn depends on general discord - like correlations between the system and an isolated ancilla .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "in this appendix we explicitly show the calculations needed to derive result using fcs methods . as stated in sec .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] , in order to calculate the energy flow per unit of time @xmath19 and the consequent measure of energy backflow @xmath75 , we need to move to the phase - space representation and consider the characteristic function @xmath150 defined in eq . .",
    "the latter is obtained from the solution of the fokker - planck differential equation @xcite associated with the master equation for @xmath8    @xmath151    where we have introduced the independent real variables @xmath152 , @xmath153 and the quantities @xmath154 .    due to the quadratic nature of the hamiltonian , the gaussian shape of the characteristic function is granted @xcite and thus an educated ansatz is @xmath155,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath156 , \\allowbreak \\mathrm{tr}_s\\left[\\rho_s(\\eta , t ) p\\right])^t   $ ] and , @xmath157 is the covariance matrix ( which is symmetric ) .",
    "finally , @xmath158 represents a time - dependent amplitude which is not conserved during the evolution due to the action of the non trace - preserving superoperator @xmath159 $ ] .",
    "having assumed this ansatz for the characteristic function @xmath160 , eq .",
    "can be equivalently expressed as @xmath161 plugging eq . into eq . and separating the different moments of q and p , it is easy to show that the evolution equation for the mean values @xmath162 as well as for the off - diagonal elements of the covariance matrix @xmath163 has the following structure : @xmath164 and therefore , provided we assume to deal with a system initially described by a thermal state so that @xmath165 , we have that @xmath166 @xmath167 . moreover @xmath168 @xcite , and thus the number of evolution equations for the gaussian parameters therefore reduce to the following two @xmath169 \\notag\\\\   & + 2\\left[v_2(\\eta , t)-\\gamma(t)\\right]\\sigma(\\eta , t ) + 2 v_1(\\eta , t)\\sigma^2(\\eta , t)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we stress that , since @xmath170 , we retrieve in the case @xmath171 the well - known solution for the characteristic function @xcite @xmath172\\ ] ] where @xmath173 is given by eq . with the initial condition @xmath174 , with @xmath175^{-1}$ ] ( @xmath56 being the effective system s initial temperature ) . from that , the final expression for the energy flow per unit of time given by eq . is easily obtained .",
    "here we give some details on the derivation of the evolution equation for the quadrature vectors @xmath176 and @xmath177 that lead , within the framework of a finite - size environment approach , to eq . .",
    "we stress that @xmath178 denote the position and momentum operators of the reduced system while the remaining @xmath80 operators refer to the environmental modes .",
    "first of all , the couplings @xmath90 are determined through the definition of the spectral density @xcite @xmath179 , which , by inversion , gives @xmath180 note that their sign is not uniquely determined by the spectral density but we arbitrarily take them to be positive .",
    "we finally point out that the qbm studied in the previous section is retrieved when we take the limit @xmath181 , in which case however the numerical approach is not treatable .    as stated in the main body of the paper , since eq .",
    "is quadratic in position and momentum , it can always be diagonalized by means of an orthogonal transformation @xmath97 @xcite , i.e. @xmath98 with @xmath182 a diagonal matrix made of the eigenvalues @xmath183 ( often referred to as _ eigenfrequencies _ ) of @xmath85 . by moving to",
    "the new coordinates @xmath184 and @xmath185 , referred to as normal modes , we can express eq .",
    "as @xmath186 which leads to a free evolution @xmath187 coming back to the original picture and defining the diagonal matrices @xmath100 and @xmath101 we get the result in eq . .",
