    "in comparison to the various families of the hole - doped cuprate superconductors the electron - doped 214 compounds ln@xmath11@xmath12 ( with ln@xmath13 pr , nd , sm , eu,@xmath14 ) have been studied less intensively , even though this system is known for more than 15 years  @xcite .",
    "there are different reasons for this .",
    "first , the growth of high quality single crystals and the post - growth annealing treatment are very demanding .",
    "second , the controlled and reproducible preparation of well characterized samples for different experiments , such as well - oriented samples with clean surfaces for optical spectroscopies , is difficult . despite these drawbacks ,",
    "the electron - doped @xmath15-compounds are very attractive as a sample set for systematic investigations for two reasons : ( i ) they are solid solutions with a simple tetragonal crystal structure and nearly the whole phase diagram can be probed using only a single compound .",
    "starting from the undoped antiferromagnetic insulator ln@xmath10@xmath16 ( with ln @xmath13 pr , nd , sm , eu,@xmath14 ) , samples with different electronic ground states up to the overdoped metallic regime can be grown by gradually doping with tetravalent ce .",
    "( ii ) with @xmath17 there is a corresponding hole - doped compound with a similar crystal structure and critical temperature @xmath4 .",
    "this provides the unique opportunity to analyze similarities and differences in the phase diagram of the electron- and hole - doped compounds .",
    "the growth of high quality @xmath15-crystals in crucibles from a cuo - rich melt is difficult for various reasons : firstly , deviations of the distribution coefficient from unity in these systems give rise to gradients in the dopant concentration of the grown crystals .",
    "secondly , it is well known from other cuprate systems , such as @xmath18  @xcite , as well as from previous work on @xmath1  @xcite , that the aggressive melts partly dissolve the most common available crucible materials .",
    "this unwanted corrosion leads to impurities and , in turn , to a deterioration of the crystal quality .",
    "we also note that the @xmath15-compounds are incongruently melting solid solutions  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the growth process is restricted to a small interval between the peritectic and eutectic points of the compositional phase diagram .",
    "the traveling solvent floating zone ( tsfz ) technique provides the opportunity and flexibility to work at a certain favorable working point within this small growth window by using a small cuo - rich flux pellet and a corresponding atmosphere and temperature .",
    "the flux pellet forms a vertical local melt , held by surface tension , where the polycrystalline feed material is dissolved at the top and re - crystallized at the bottom on a seed . using suitable growth conditions , an equilibrium between growth and solubility rate can be obtained . in this way",
    "large crystals of several centimeters length can be grown under accurately controllable stable conditions ( flux composition , temperature , oxygen partial pressure ) .",
    "this is the basic prerequisite for homogeneous crystals .    for the growth of a series of ln@xmath11@xmath19 crystals ( with ln @xmath13 nd , pr )",
    "we have used a @xmath20-mirror furnace with four @xmath21w halogen lamps .",
    "the polycrystalline feed rods and flux pellets were prepared in the following way : for the feed rods the corresponding rare earth oxides and cuo ( with purity of @xmath22 ) were mixed according to the desired stoichiometric composition of the @xmath15-compounds .",
    "then , phase pure ceramic samples were obtained by a five - fold pre - reaction of the powders at temperatures of @xmath23c , @xmath24c , @xmath25c , and two times at @xmath26c for @xmath27h in air . between each calcination",
    "step the pre - reacted powder was homogenized by grinding .",
    "the multiple calcination promotes the homogeneity .",
    "the phase formation of the powder was checked by x - ray powder diffraction . the phase pure ceramic samples were pressed hydrostatically to rods of @xmath28 mm in diameter and @xmath29 mm in length .",
    "these polycrystalline rods were sintered in air at temperatures of @xmath30c , @xmath31c , and @xmath32c for @xmath33h , respectively . these high temperatures close to the peritectic temperature",
    "are important in order to increase the density , avoiding the absorption of the liquid flux during crystal growth .",
    "the flux material with the composition ratio @xmath34ln@xmath35/\\mathrm{cuo } = 15/85 $ ] was pre - reacted in the same way as the feed rods , followed by an annealing step at @xmath36c for @xmath27h in air .    for single crystal growth ,",
    "a piece of a polycrystalline rod was used as a seed . on this seed a flux pellet of @xmath37 g was placed .",
    "the mass and size of this flux pellet needs to be adjusted to the dimensions of the radiation focus and the diameter of the rods .",
    "the vertical molten zone has a diameter and length of @xmath38 mm and can easily be held by surface tension during the entire growth process .",
    "the growth atmosphere , i.e. the oxygen partial pressure @xmath39 , was found to be the most critical parameter .",
    "it affects both the growth temperature and the crystallizing phases , as well as the stability of the growth process .",
    "while undoped compounds ln@xmath10@xmath16 grow stable in a pure o@xmath10 atmosphere at a pressure of @xmath40bar , the growth at low @xmath41 is unstable .",
    "the opposite situation was found for doped ln@xmath11@xmath19 , even for relatively small ce content @xmath8 .",
    "our growth experiments clearly showed that with increasing ce content @xmath8 a decreasing oxygen partial pressure @xmath41 is required for the optimal growth conditions .",
    "the set of @xmath1 crystals was grown in a mixture of ar / o@xmath10 with @xmath42bar for @xmath43 and @xmath44bar for @xmath45 .",
    "the set of @xmath0 crystals was also grown in an ar / o@xmath10 atmosphere with @xmath42bar for @xmath46 and @xmath47bar for @xmath48 . in order to suppress cu - evaporation from the melt",
    ", a pressure of @xmath49bar was applied .",
    "as the evaporation of cu is very small compared to the used amount of flux , this loss can be balanced by the flux itself without changing the growth conditions .",
    "we note that the change of the flux composition due to the cuo evaporation can be estimated from the weight loss of the whole system before and after the growth process and does not exceed 2% .",
    "the evaporation in @xmath1 is slightly higher than in the @xmath2 system .",
    "a surplus of @xmath50% cuo in the feed rod composition for compensating this evaporation makes it difficult to control the growth process , which often results in cuo inclusions and ( during the long lasting growth experiments ) unstable solvent zones .",
    "apart from the cuo inclusions , precipitations of ceo@xmath10 on microscopic scale and macroscopic clustering of the dopant can only be avoided by means of an appropriate atmosphere with low @xmath41 .",
    "doped crystals grown in pure o@xmath10 , as it is often suggested in literature  @xcite , or at too high oxygen partial pressure for the respective ce content @xmath8 are inhomogeneous .",
    "this results in broad transition curves as well as in ambiguous and varying relations between @xmath4 values and the nominal ce content @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , a slow decomposition of the compounds over longer time periods ( usually several months to several years ) is obtained . in order to support the homogeneity of the molten zone ,",
    "the seed and feed rods are rotated in opposite directions at about @xmath51rpm .",
    "the growth rate for all crystals was @xmath52mm / h as determined by the external movement of the mirror system .",
    "these small growth rates and also small diameters of the grown rods proved to be important for obtaining rods consisting of only a single grain .",
    "we note that thinner diameters of the crystallized rod can be obtained by pulling away the feed rod simultaneously during the growth process .",
    "for all crystals the preferred growth direction was along the crystallographic @xmath53 $ ] or @xmath54 $ ] axis .",
    "this is caused by the fact that the grains grow much faster along the cuo - layers than perpendicular to them .",
    "in this way only grains with the favorable orientation survive during the growth process .",
    "the possibility of the simultaneous growth of several grains with slightly different orientations restricts the use of the samples in experiments , where all these grains have to be extracted and individually oriented .",
    "this is for example the case in neutron scattering experiments , where big crystals of several grams are required .",
    "a way out would be to influence the growth direction by using a single crystal as seed .",
    "however , this has been found difficult , as marginal deviations from the optimal growth conditions at the beginning of the growth process lead to the nucleation of new grains or the crystallization of small amounts of flux material .",
    "[ fig1](a ) shows a grown crystal rod of @xmath55 with a @xmath56-oriented facet , which is present on the last @xmath57 cm of the rod [ left - hand side in fig .",

    "( b ) and ( c ) show rocking curves of the @xmath58 peak of @xmath1 and @xmath2 crystals , respectively .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) for all crystals with different ce contents is less than @xmath59 . ]",
    "the metal composition along and perpendicular to the growth direction of the crystals was controlled by energy dispersive x - ray analysis ( edx ) . within the accuracy of the measurement the grown single crystals",
    "exhibit the same chemical composition as the feed rods : no inhomogeneities or gradients of the rare earth concentrations in growth as well as in the radial direction were found .",
    "small deviations in the doping concentration ( @xmath60 ) , microscopic precipitations of @xmath61o@xmath62 as well as variations in the oxygen distribution within the specimens could not be detected by edx .",
    "more accurate information about the microscopic homogeneity can be obtained from magnetization measurements and from the onset and the shape of superconducting transition curves of different crystals , which are annealed at well defined conditions .",
    "the solubility limit of ce in @xmath3 and @xmath2 is found at @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "x - ray analysis confirms the phase purity and the t-structure of the as - grown crystals .",
    "moreover , the rocking curves of the ( 006)-peak show a full width at half maximum fwhm @xmath65 for all doping levels [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ] .",
    "these values are to our knowledge the smallest values reported so far for electron - doped @xmath15-compounds .",
    "the mosaicity of the crystals is hardly improved by the annealing treatment .",
    "however , we can confirm the formation of small amounts of epitaxially grown ( ln , ce)@xmath10o@xmath62 impurity phases  @xcite due to the annealing treatment , which is independent from the doping concentration .",
    "rods consisting of two or several grains are separated and oriented before annealing .",
    "bulk superconductivity was verified by specific heat measurements .",
    "we emphasize that pieces cut from the inner part of large crystals have the same transition curves ( @xmath4 , @xmath66 ) as the whole crystal itself .",
    "thus , core - shell effects can be ruled out . the as - grown and annealed crystals were stable over several years , without changing their physical properties .",
    "crack- and inclusion - free high quality crystals are difficult to cleave .",
    "therefore , for measurements ( spectroscopic measurements , transport , etc . )",
    "the crystals had to be oriented , cut , and polished in an appropriate way .",
    "this time consuming work is a drawback compared to the easily cleaving compounds of the bi - family and @xmath67 which grow in a platelet shape .",
    "an annealing treatment of the crystals after the growth process eliminates tension in the crystal and disorder in the metal sublattice . at the same time it removes interstitial oxygen .",
    "the as - grown @xmath2 crystals , grown in an atmosphere of @xmath68bar , are not superconducting , whereas @xmath1 , grown at the same @xmath41 , shows a broad transition with @xmath69k .",
    "unfortunately , the growth process at such low @xmath41 for @xmath3 is not stable enough .",
    "thus , growth atmospheres with higher oxygen partial pressure as described above were used .",
    "this results in excess oxygen in the as - grown samples requiring a post - growth annealing treatment .    in the past , many studies concerning the optimal annealing parameters , phase decomposition and oxygen loss have been carried out  @xcite . the general consensus of all these studies is , that bulk superconductivity and sharp transition curves are only realized by a severe reduction treatment of the as - grown samples . in this process a small doping dependent amount of the excess oxygen @xmath70 is removed .",
    "nevertheless , fundamental questions regarding the onset , shape and doping interval of the superconducting dome , the absolute value of the oxygen content of the as - grown and reduced samples , the role of additional oxygen in the compound , and the reversibility of the reduction step have not yet been settled and currently are controversially discussed . in order to verify the different results ,",
    "we annealed the samples in the following way : as - grown single crystals were annealed for @xmath71h in a flow of pure ar @xmath72 ( o@xmath10 @xmath73ppm ) at constant temperatures close to the stability limit .",
    "the stability limit for this annealing treatment depends on the ce content as well as on the rare earth element @xmath74 and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .     for @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the lines are guides to the eye .",
    "all samples are annealed in a flow of pure ar @xmath72 ( o@xmath10 @xmath73ppm ) for @xmath71h . ]    for the annealing step , the crystals were enclosed in polycrystalline crucibles of the same material in order to provide a homogeneous environment and to protect the crystal surface .",
    "after the treatment at high temperatures the crystals were cooled down to room temperature at moderate cooling rates .",
    "the crystals were not quenched , since the intention was to remove the excess oxygen but not to freeze - in a specific o@xmath10 ordering state . in this way we avoided additional tension in the metallic sublattice which could occur upon quenching .",
    "this procedure was applied to all doped crystals of both compounds .",
    "depending on the ce content @xmath8 , the crystals exhibit sharp transition curves as shown in fig .",
    "it has been often reported in literature  @xcite that the annealing treatment depends on the sample size .",
    "moreover , it was suggested that a subsequent additional annealing step after the reduction step , which is then performed in pure o@xmath10 at moderate temperatures of @xmath75c for @xmath27h increases @xmath4 .",
    "however , for our crystals with masses ranging from @xmath76 to @xmath77 mg we do not see any size effect of the transition curves .",
    "this observation confirms that the oxygen diffusion coefficient @xmath78 and diffusion lengths @xmath79 are large enough at the annealing temperatures used in our experiments .",
    "moreover , a second , short annealing treatment at moderate temperatures in pure o@xmath10 complicates the control of the oxygen content and the microscopic homogeneity of the crystal , as @xmath78 might be completely different at the different annealing steps at high and moderate temperatures . for example , it is well known from diffusion studies on yba@xmath10cu@xmath62o@xmath80 and re-@xmath81 single crystals , that @xmath78 varies over several orders of magnitude . since there are no reliable studies of the kinematics of the oxygen diffusion process for the @xmath15-crystals , results of annealing experiments under different atmospheres , temperatures and time scales are speculative .",
    "we also note that studies on large ceramic samples give misleading results , as the in- and out - diffusion of oxygen is mainly governed by grain boundaries , micro - cracks and other imperfections of the specimen .",
    "( a ) and @xmath2 ( b ) single crystals plotted versus temperature for samples with different ce contents . for a better comparison",
    "the measured diamagnetic susceptibilities are normalized to their low temperature values .",
    "note , that the sample mass ranges from @xmath82 to @xmath77 mg .",
    "for @xmath55 we obtain @xmath83k and @xmath84k , whereas for @xmath85 we find @xmath86k and @xmath87k . ]      thermogravimetric experiments and subsequent x - ray powder diffraction on high quality as - grown single crystals are performed in order to estimate the absolute oxygen content @xmath88 per formula unit .",
    "the absolute oxygen concentration is required for an accurate determination of the oxygen loss during the annealing treatment from the measured mass difference between as - grown and annealed samples .",
    "as the oxygen non - stoichiometry in the @xmath15-compounds is very small , only crack- and inclusion - free single crystals of @xmath89 mg mass were used for these experiments in order to avoid misleading results .",
    "systematic errors coming from the experimental setup are minimized by recording a base line ahead of each measurement .",
    "the oxygen concentration is calculated from the measured weight loss during the reduction in a flow of forming gas with composition @xmath90 for @xmath7h at @xmath91c .",
    "the crystals decompose according to the following equation , where @xmath92nd ,  pr : @xmath93 undoped as - grown crystals show a nearly stoichiometric oxygen content . upon increasing the ce content",
    "@xmath8 the oxygen surplus @xmath94 increases slightly and has values of about @xmath95 for optimally doped @xmath96 and @xmath85 .",
    "note , that the absolute value depends on the oxygen partial pressure @xmath39 used during the crystal growth .",
    "this might also be an explanation of different values in literature reported for the oxygen non - stoichiometry and the oxygen loss during annealing , as the crystals are grown in different atmospheres . for crystals with ce concentrations",
    "@xmath8 within the superconducting dome the oxygen loss amounts to @xmath97 for @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the annealed samples have a stoichiometric number of @xmath98 for oxygen , which hardly differs from the nominal value of @xmath99 within the uncertainty of the experiment .",
    "therefore , as discussed in more detail below , oxygen does not play an important role regarding the doping level and we can set @xmath100 .",
    "here , @xmath101 is the carrier concentration per cu - ion and @xmath8 is the ce concentration .",
    "fig .  [ fig4 ] shows the transition temperatures as a function of the ce content @xmath8 for both electron - doped @xmath15-compounds discussed in this paper .",
    "we recall that in the hole - doped cuprates superconductivity appears within a broad doping interval of @xmath102 $ ] and @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the optimum doping level corresponding to the maximum @xmath4 value  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for the electron - doped compounds @xmath1 and @xmath0 the superconducting dome is restricted to a much smaller doping range and does in general not show a quadratic dependence @xmath105 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , for the @xmath1 system superconductivity abruptly sets in at @xmath106 and @xmath4 jumps up to @xmath107 @xmath108 . in the overdoped region",
    "the @xmath109 dependence can be well described by the empirical quadratic function ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) @xmath110 with @xmath111k . according to this empirical curve",
    ", @xmath4 becomes zero at @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "a comparison of the empirical curve with the experimental results in the underdoped region reveals a slight asymmetry of the superconducting dome in the @xmath1 system .",
    "however , more crystals with even finer variations in the ce concentration in the range @xmath114 $ ] are required to clarify the onset point and the sudden occurrence of superconductivity with @xmath4 values of about @xmath115 at @xmath116 . from the doping point of view the overdoped region",
    "can be controlled in a better way .",
    "notably , the whole superconducting region down to @xmath117 can be probed , as a solubility limit of @xmath63 is found for ce in the @xmath1 system . in this context",
    "the width of the transition curves as a measure of the quality of the crystals has to be discussed .",
    "it is clear , that crystals near optimal doping show the sharpest transition curves , since slight variations in the doping of the specimen do not strongly affect @xmath4 . in the overdoped region ,",
    "the crystals are very sensitive to small doping variations due to the steep slope of the @xmath109 curve defining the superconducting dome .",
    "for example , for a sample with nominal doping @xmath118 and a spatial variation in the doping level as small as @xmath119 , a transition width of @xmath120k is expected . in the underdoped region",
    "the situation is even more complicated and it is not clear whether inhomogeneities of the crystals or other effects are responsible for the observed broad transition curves .    in the @xmath2 system , the overdoped region can not be reliably probed due to precipitations of the dopant .",
    "therefore , the comparison of the superconducting phase diagram is restricted to the optimal and underdoped regions . comparing the @xmath2 and @xmath1 system",
    ", we have to point to two common properties : first , the optimum doping level @xmath64 is about the same and , second , both systems show an abrupt onset of superconductivity in the underdoped region . for @xmath2 ,",
    "this onset is found at @xmath121 . however , there are also pronounced differences in the @xmath122 dependence of both systems .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] that the @xmath2 system shows a much broader @xmath109 dependence in the underdoped regime .",
    "this difference in the shape of the superconducting dome is most likely the result of material specific issues and is a general problem when comparing electron - doped compounds .",
    "therefore , in the future one main task should be the elimination of material specific factors in order to merge the different phase diagrams of the electron - doped compound into a general one .",

    "the oscillations are periodic in the @xmath164 scale , their positions being independent of temperature  @xcite .",
    "such behavior is characteristic of the shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) effect originating from the landau quantization of the electron spectrum of a metal in a high magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the oscillation frequency , @xmath165 t is directly related to the area of the cyclotron orbit on the cylindrical fermi surface : @xmath166  m@xmath167 .",
    "this corresponds to 41.4% of the first brillouin zone area , in excellent agreement with the predictions of band structure calculations  @xcite and results of angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes )  @xcite .",
    "the samples with lower doping , @xmath151 and 0.16 , also show sdh oscillations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) ) , however , at much lower frequencies , @xmath168  t and @xmath169  t , respectively . the corresponding fermi surface cross - section amounts to only @xmath170 of the brillouin zone area . such a drastic change of the sdh frequency indicates a reconstruction of the fermi surface due to a broken translational symmetry .",
    "it can be explained by introducing a @xmath171 density - wave potential  @xcite .",
    "the slow oscillations are consistent with the size of small hole pockets formed at the new brillouin zone boundary as a result of folding the original large fermi surface .",
    "similar results revealing small closed pockets of a reconstructed fermi surface have been obtained from quantum oscillation experiments on p - underdoped yba@xmath128cu@xmath172o@xmath173  @xcite and yba@xmath128cu@xmath174o@xmath175  @xcite . however , by contrast to the latter compounds , in the n - doped @xmath1 the ordering potential is manifest already on the overdoped side of the phase diagram , at @xmath176 . moreover",
    ", the observation of fast oscillations at @xmath160 does not unambiguously rule out the possibility of the superlattice at this doping . indeed , our most recent data on samples with @xmath160  @xcite show evidence of magnetic breakdown , suggesting the fermi surface to be reconstructed even at this high doping level .",
    "further work on magnetic quantum oscillations is in progress , in order to verify this suggestion and obtain more information about the fermi surface and its dependence on the carrier concentration in the electron - doped superconductors .",
    "we have grown high quality single crystals of the electron - doped cuprate superconductors @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "we discuss the optimal growth parameters and annealing conditions as a function of ce content @xmath8 required to achieve such crystals .",
    "we show that the oxygen partial pressure of the growth atmosphere has to be reduce with increasing @xmath8 in order to avoid microscopic ceo@xmath128 precipitations .",
    "we also present an optimized annealing process resulting in narrow transition curves . in the @xmath1 system",
    "the whole phase diagram can be probed with high quality single crystals , whereas in @xmath2 the overdoped regime is inaccessible due to the lower solubility limit of ce . here , the system la@xmath177pr@xmath178ce@xmath146cuo@xmath147 might be an adequate alternative . the microscopic oxygen distribution can be checked by magnetic measurements .",
    "the as - grown doped crystals exhibit an excess oxygen concentration of @xmath179 , which is nearly completely removed after annealing .",
