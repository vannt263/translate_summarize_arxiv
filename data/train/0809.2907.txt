    "in this letter we present the results of an analysis of correlated @xmath10-hyperon and triton ( @xmath3 ) pairs following the @xmath0 absorption reaction on several nuclei .",
    "the data were collected by the finuda spectrometer running at the laboratori nazionali di frascati ( lnf ) , italy .",
    "data on reactions of @xmath11 nuclear absorption with the emission of nucleons and nuclei are scarce . the bulk of the available data belongs to bubble chamber experiments , which mainly aimed at assessing the @xmath11 capture rates of multipionic final states @xcite .",
    "a handful of measurements studied the @xmath11-absorption reaction leading to non - mesonic channels @xcite .",
    "this investigation received a strong boost recently , when non - mesonic channels were related to the non - mesonic decay mode of @xmath12-nuclear bound ( knb ) states .",
    "the existence of such states is presently being debated within the hadron physics community . according to the theoretical models ,",
    "knb states preferentially decay to a hyperon and one ( @xmath13 ) or more nucleons ( @xmath14 ) , the decay into pionic channels being suppressed by the strong binding energy of such states @xcite . therefore",
    ", the invariant mass studies of @xmath15 pairs could provide direct evidence of their existence .",
    "inclusive or semi - inclusive spectra such as the energy spectrum of @xmath13 also supply information about the nature of knb states ; however , the sizable continuous background and the meager content of information may lead to erroneous interpretation of results . as earlier pointed out , the k - absorption reaction on nucleon clusters leading to non - mesonic final states is still poorly examined .",
    "therefore , further experimental studies are needed , which may clarify the mechanism of kaon absorption on multibarionic systems .",
    "experimental studies on the existence of @xmath11-nuclear bound states were performed by the finuda collaboration by examining the invariant mass distribution of @xmath16 pairs @xcite .",
    "these distributions show bumps standing over a continuous background .",
    "the width of these bumps is several tens of mev , and their strength lies below the sum of the @xmath17 rest masses .",
    "moreover , the @xmath10-hyperon was found to be strongly back - to - back correlated with the selected nucleon(s ) , which indicates that the negative kaon strongly couples to the @xmath18 nucleon clusters before decaying to @xmath16 pairs .",
    "all these findings are compatible with the formation of bound @xmath19 $ ] clusters .",
    "a full kinematic analysis of the @xmath11-induced reactions in nuclei is difficult because of the limited experimental information about the residual nuclear fragments .",
    "a study of @xmath20 pairs emitted after @xmath11 absorption at rest on @xmath21he was recently performed by the kek - ps e549 collaboration @xcite .",
    "the observed invariant mass distribution of the back - to - back correlated @xmath20 pairs displays features which resemble those of the finuda invariant mass distribution for @xmath22 ; for instance , compare fig . 3 of refs . @xcite and @xcite , respectively .    following this trail ,",
    "a study of @xmath3 coincidence events from the @xmath23 reaction was pursued by finuda and will be presented in this letter along with a discussion on several reaction mechanisms which can explain the observed data . to our knowledge ,",
    "only one old measurement of @xmath11 at rest induced interactions leading to final @xmath3 pairs exists @xcite . in this measurement , only three events ( out of 3258 ) were found to be compatible with the @xmath24@xmath25 reaction .",
    "in this study , the @xmath3 events from the absorption reaction @xmath23 are reconstructed in finuda .",
    "the residual nucleus , @xmath26 , is regarded as a system of @xmath27 $ ] nucleons whose final state is not reconstructed . due to the poor @xmath3 statistics , the contribution of all the targets , @xmath1li and @xmath2be , is summed .",

    "is then requested . below this momentum",

    "this approach lowers the @xmath43 threshold to @xmath30430 mev/@xmath44 since tritons are required to cross only the low - mass region of the spectrometer .",

    "the experimental data are sharply peaked at @xmath68 thus indicating that correlated @xmath3 pairs are mostly emitted in opposite directions .",
    "since the data sum the contributions of all the targets , the cos@xmath58 narrowness indicates that the emission of such pairs is almost independent of the nuclear target , and @xmath10 s and @xmath39 s are negligibly affected by final state interactions ( fsi ) in the different targets . in the following , when modeling the @xmath67 absorption , the phase space simulated distributions are shaped to fit the narrow distribution of the cos@xmath58 measured spectrum .     vs @xmath43 plots for the direct reactions ( a ) @xmath69 and ( b ) @xmath70 , where the notation @xmath26 represents a bound system of nucleons and @xmath13 a single nucleon .",

    "such a strong correlation suggests that the data - points are consistent with a direct reaction mechanism with ( at least ) four bodies in the final state , @xmath76 .",

    "if these pions are absorbed while leaving the nucleus then they return their total energy to the reaction and the reaction phase space changes . in this case , if the absorbing cluster is an @xmath86-substructure @xmath87 the momenta of the emerging tritons matches well the measured momenta . however , the @xmath10 hyperons coming from the @xmath84 reaction have @xmath88300 mev/@xmath44 , which is clearly lower than the measured @xmath10 momenta .",
    "@xmath10 hyperons can also be produced by the two - body absorption reaction @xmath89 .",

    "the number of @xmath3 pairs collected is low ; nevertheless , a comparison of the @xmath3 data with the phase space of several reactions makes it possible to draw several important conclusions .",
    "the phase space was constrained to reproduce the angular distribution of the detected @xmath3 pairs , that is , their strong back - to - back correlation . for the multistep reactions ,",
    "the interacting nucleon and nucleon clusters were taken with their fermi motion .",
    "the events resulting from the reaction modeling were reconstructed in finuda to account for the spectrometer acceptance . the comparison between data - points and simulations",
    "is based solely on the overlap of diffusion ( contour ) plots .",
    "the phase space volume of the @xmath94 absorption reaction yielding final pions barely overlaps the kinematic volume covered by the measured @xmath3 pairs .",
    "this indicates that the @xmath3 channel is primarily a non - pionic channel .    the @xmath102 correlation plot of the two - step process @xmath103\\rightarrow n\\lambda[a-2]\\rightarrow \\lambda t a'$ ] ( fig .",
    "5(b ) ) overlaps some of the @xmath104 measured data - points .",
    "this suggests that this multistep process may favor final @xmath3 events .",
    "however , it requires ( at least ) two subsequent reactions to occur , which lessens the reaction probability to open the @xmath3 channel with respect to the direct reaction mechanism ( fig .",
    "the results obtained for the cos@xmath58 distribution indicate that the @xmath3-pair production is strongly driven by reaction dynamics ; in fact , phase - space simulations which are able to explain the @xmath105 correlation plot are not capable of describing the cos@xmath58 behavior ( fig .",
    "3 ) . a reaction mechanism qualitatively capable of explaining the sharp peak and the number of nucleons involved requires that negative kaons are favorably absorbed by @xmath86-like substructures of nuclei giving rise to the @xmath106 reaction .",
    "the reactions @xmath107 are largely capable of explaining the data - points ( fig .",
    "they are partially explained by the @xmath108 reaction channel . by allowing a further nucleon in the final state , the reaction @xmath76 complements the agreement .",
    "such a nucleon might well be the consequence of a nuclear de - excitation similar to the process of negative pion absorption at rest in nuclei .",
    "in fact , the sharpness of the cos@xmath58 distribution indicates that @xmath10 and @xmath39 fsi are minimal .",
    "the mechanism for these reactions could be either a simple quasi - free transition , or a more composite process which embodies an intermediate bound system , @xmath109\\rightarrow\\lambda t$ ] .",
    "unfortunately , further analysis can not be performed because of the poor statistics of the present data and , therefore , a specific reaction mechanism can not be disentangled .",
    "finally , the modeling of the process @xmath110 ; @xmath78 shows that phase - space and data - points moderately overlap .",
    "accordingly , some of the @xmath3 strength derives from it .",
    "the @xmath111 reactions can not be explained by looking only at a specific observable . in order to fully understand the reaction mechanism , including possible intermediate states ( i.e. , knb states ) , many observables must be measured such as @xmath112 invariant masses , angular correlations , @xmath10 and @xmath113 momenta , absorption rates etc .. as well , theories must be able to account for most of the measured observables before giving a reliable view of the dynamics of the absorption process . in this",
    "regard , recent theoretical articles about the @xmath67 reaction meet these requirements @xcite .",
    "the value determined for the @xmath24@xmath114 absorption rate is @xmath115 .",
    "this value is compatible with the absorption rate previously published for @xmath116 @xmath117 @xcite , which indicates that the measured process is likely due to direct multinucleon non - pionic k absorption .",
