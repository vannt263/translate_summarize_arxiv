    "fig : schematic-1 ] , the system being considered consists of two coupled parts : * ( i ) * an electronic wire and * ( ii ) * a vibrational mode . here , we first focus on the hamiltonian part of the dynamics of each subsystem and their coupling .",
    "our model aims at capturing the salient features of the energy of a molecular wire .",
    "such system consists of a three - modular molecular junction encompassing a left ( @xmath4 ) , right ( @xmath5 ) and central ( @xmath6 ) region .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath5 part of the junction are connected , through leads , to an external potential , thus putting the junction out of equilibrium and allowing for the circulation of an electronic current .",
    "the conductance of the junction depends on the conformation of the molecule itself : by putting part @xmath6 out of the plane containing both @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( which we assume to be coplanar ) , the resistance offered by the junction to the current can be varied in light of the modifications induced to the overlap of the electronic wave - functions that is responsible for the conduction . in what follows",
    ", we will focus on the case of small fluctuations around an otherwise stable molecular conformation ( i.e. a stable relative angle between the central and peripheral parts of the molecular junction ) .",
    "the relative angle between the in - plane and out - of - plane parts of the junction would thus oscillate around the macroscopically stable configuration , such oscillations being treated quantum mechanically . a minimal model that is able to capture the essential conformational influences over electric conductance is as follows .",
    "we consider two single - occupation sites whose energy is given by the on - site hamiltonian ( where we have neglected the coulomb interaction and have assumed units such that @xmath7 ) @xmath8 here , @xmath9 is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of an electron occupying the left ( @xmath4 ) and right ( @xmath5 ) site . for simplicity",
    "we restrict ourself to @xmath10 .",
    "we have assumed that the electrons do not hop directly between sites , an assumption invoked only to simplify our approach but that does not affect the phenomenology that will be illustrated here .",
    "our model also includes a vibrational mode , which is described under harmonic approximation as @xmath11 here , @xmath12 is the vibrational frequency , @xmath13 is the mode annihilation ( creation ) operator , and @xmath14 is the associated position - like operator .",
    "we consider the case of a harmonic oscillator driven by a constant force of strength @xmath15 .",
    "electronic and vibrational subsystems are coupled according to the model @xmath16 which describes phonon - assisted inter - site hopping at a rate @xmath17 , which in turn depends on the position of the oscillator , i.e. the molecular conformation .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the system is thus @xmath18 the assumption of small oscillations around a stable configuration justifies a series expansion of the hopping rate as @xmath19 .",
    "this gives rise to a standard hopping mechanism connecting the two sites being considered , and a phonon - assisted one , occurring at rate @xmath20 , that depends explicitly on @xmath21 .",
    "thermal excitations are a possible physical mechanism responsible for the oscillations around the stable molecular conformation .",
    "we thus consider a thermal reservoir coupled to the vibrational mode .",
    "this leads to the dynamical model @xmath22+\\mathcal{l}_{\\text{v}}[\\hat{\\rho}_{\\text{m}}],\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the density matrix of the system and we have introduced the lindblad dissipator @xmath24=\\frac{\\gamma\\bar{n}}{2 } d[\\hat a^\\dag,\\bullet]+\\frac{\\gamma(\\bar{n}+1)}{2 } d[\\hat a,\\bullet ] , \\label{eq : ldiss-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the coupling strength to the bosonic bath , @xmath26 is the mean number of excitations in the bath ( related to the bath s temperature by @xmath27 - 1)$ ] ) , and @xmath28=(2\\hat o\\bullet\\hat{o}^\\dag-\\ { \\hat{o}^\\dag\\hat{o},\\bullet\\})$ ] .",
    "the equation of motion of the annihilation operator of the vibrational mode reads @xmath29 we assume that the oscillatory mode reaches its steady - state in a time much shorter than the characteristic time of the evolution of the system , so that we can advocate for the validity of the adiabatic approximation , according to which the state of the oscillator can be assumed to be stationary and unaffected by the coupling to the electronic wire .",
    "its degrees of freedom can thus be traced out to seek for an effective reduced dynamics of the electronic system . from eq .",

    "it is worth noticing that this last process leads to an enhancement of the conduction through the wire .",
    "moreover the strength of such an incoherent process depends directly on the temperature of the bath attached to the vibrational mode through the mean occupation number @xmath26 .",
    "such decoherence induced by the molecular vibration conserves the number of excitations , stating that , under the assumptions considered here , there is no energy exchange between the wire and the vibronic system .",
    "we find it convenient , for the continuation of our analysis , to move to the eigenbasis of the effective hamiltonian in eq .  , which involves non - local states @xcite , so as to get the diagonal operator @xmath48 where @xmath49 are the system energies ( ordered so that @xmath50 ) , corresponding to the non - local states @xmath51 .",
    "in what follows , we use a notation such that the states @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) represents configurations with @xmath54 and @xmath55 electrons in the left and right site , respectively .",
    "we call these _ local - basis _ states .",
    "a close analysis reveals that the first and last eigenstates in the non - local basis are identical to those of the local one , that is @xmath56 where no electrons are in the system and @xmath57 where one electron is on each sites .",
    "notice that the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "does not couple subspaces with a different total number of electrons in the sites .",
    "the intermediate states @xmath58 and @xmath59 are instead coupled to give rise to the non - local states @xmath60 as @xmath61 with @xmath62 the change - of - basis matrix @xmath63 where we have introduced the parameters @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "let us now connect each electronic site to a lead .",
    "the picture we have in mind can be sketched as in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic-1 ] , where each electronic site is individually coupled to its own fermionic bath .",
    "the hamiltonian of each lead is @xmath66 where @xmath67 refers to the left or right lead and @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) the fermonic destruction ( creation ) operator for the @xmath70 mode in the @xmath71 bath .",
    "the coupling between the electronic sites and each lead is of the hopping form @xmath72 we will now eliminate the leads degrees of freedom . writing eq . in the eigenbasis of the electronic subsystem",

    "the first ( second ) line of eq .   describes the transition between the wire ground state @xmath76 ( highest energy state @xmath77 ) and an intermediate state ( either @xmath78 or @xmath79 ) . as in refs .",
    "@xcite , assuming the born - markov approximation , we eliminate the degrees of freedoms of both leads , giving rise to two effective dissipators @xmath80 , i.e. one per lead , as defined in appendix [ sub : dissipation - of - the ] . for simplicity",

    "we decompose the dissipation due to the leads , taken in the local picture as @xmath86 , where the first refers to usual amplitude damping channel and the second one to decoherence .",
    "both are explicitly defined in appendix [ sub : dissipation - of - the ] [ eq .   and",
    "respectively ] . notice that last term @xmath87 is not of a dephasing type because it changes the system energy as well as coherences .    despite a rather simple system the dynamics taking place and",
    "especially the dissipation acting on the system is rich .",
    "we will now focus on this dynamics in order to determine the exchange taking place between the system and the leads .",
    "in this section we discuss the evolution of the electronic subsystem driven by its effective dynamics and connect it to the exchange statistics with the leads , using the thermodynamics of trajectories ( sec .",
    "[ sub : exchange - statistics ] ) .",
    "we then develop a systematic approach to identify the regime maximizing the enhancement effect provided to the current crossing the devices ( sec .",
    "[ sub : systematic ] ) arising from the presence of the vibrational mode .      in order to find the stationary state of the system",
    "we restrict ourselves to the evolution of the diagonal elements of the density matrix @xmath88 in the local basis .",
    "however , due to the interaction and possible hybridization of intermediate levels , terms such as @xmath89 and @xmath90 are also crucial .",
    "the dynamics of the electronic system can be tracked by writing its density matrix in vector form as @xmath91 @xmath92 , and the master equation as @xmath93 the form of the superoperator @xmath94 , which is not essential for the discussions to follow , is provided in appendix  [ sub : superop ] .",
    "the resulting dynamics is similar to the one found in ref .",
    "@xcite , albeit with specific features that should be stressed . among them ,",
    "the most significant is that the incoherent hopping induced by the vibrational mode acts directly on both the coherences ( @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) of the electronic density matrix , and the occupations of the intermediate states ( @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) .    to determine the exchange statistics taking place between the system and the leads we now use the formalism of thermodynamics of trajectories @xcite",
    ": we define a counting process of the net exchange of excitations between the system and the right leads such as @xmath99 , where @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) refers to an increment related to excitations leaving ( entering ) the system to ( from ) the lead @xmath71 inducing a transition between level @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the introduction of such process modifies the dynamics of the electronic density matrix , which now obeys the biased master equation @xmath104+\\mathcal{l}_{s}[\\hat\\rho_{s}]$ ] where the biasing contribution to the evolution @xmath105 is defined in eq . and where @xmath106 is the biased density matrix with @xmath107 a projector over the subspace where the selected counting process results in @xmath108 excitations being exchanged .",
    "as done previously , we consider the evolution of the vector of relevant density matrix elements @xmath109@xmath110 @xmath111 , which occurs as @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is given in appedix  [ sub : superop ] .",
    "the interesting feature of this system is that even the evolution of the coherences may induce changes on the counting statistics . at this stage",

    "more directly we can access also the first cumulants of the chosen exchange statistics using a bypassing approach not requiring numerical coarse - graining , similar to the one introduced in ref .",

    "we now assume that the incoherent hopping strength @xmath131 is independent of the other parameters .",
    "the idea here is to find out which range of parameters gives rise to the largest enhancement due to the presence of the vibrational mode .",
    "in order to do so we distinguish between six different cases depending on the leads configuration , as summarized in the table reported in fig .",

    "we find that cases 1 and 3 , with no bias voltage applied between the two leads and with their chemical potential respectively below @xmath137 and above @xmath138 , give a zero mean current .",
    "conversely case 2 , where @xmath139 lies between @xmath137 and @xmath138 , corresponds to a non - zero net flux from @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "this case is of special interest as it allows for conduction without need of bias voltage .",
    "this derives from the conformation of the system .",
    "in fact , such a net flux is also present without taking into account the molecular vibration .",
    "however , the presence of the vibrational mode gives rise to a significant enhancement on the conduction process , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cases2 ] , where we present the difference between the net flux crossing the system with and without incoherent hopping as a function of @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "( where @xmath142 is the net exchange neglecting incoherent hopping , @xmath143 ) , describing the impact of the presence of the vibrational mode . in the vertical axis",
    "we have as a parameter the splitting between the energy level of each site @xmath144 , normalized by the coupling strength to the leads @xmath145 .",
    "the horizontal axis corresponds to coupling strength @xmath141 between the two physical electronic sites , normalized by @xmath145 .",
    "the black dashed line represents the maximum enhancement for given @xmath141 and @xmath140 .",
    "the parameter are such as @xmath146[fig : cases2],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    as we can see , in case 2 the maximum enhancement occurs for @xmath147",
    ". moreover , the enhancement gets more significant as @xmath141 and @xmath140 tend to zero .",
    "this comes from the fact that for @xmath148 we have clearly @xmath149 if @xmath150 , while for @xmath151 and @xmath132 , @xmath152 tends to be constant .",
    "consequently , in this case , for small @xmath140 and @xmath141 , the conduction process is dominated by incoherent hopping induced by the vibrational mode . in this case",
    "we find that the relation @xmath132 gives rise to the smallest fano factor ( @xmath153 ) depending on @xmath141 and @xmath140 , which is smaller than 1 and converging monotonously to 1 while increasing @xmath141 and @xmath140 , which indicates anti - bunching of the electron emission .",
    "the remaining three cases all include a bias voltage ( cf .",
    "[ fig : cases ] ) . in all of them",
    "we have observed a similar conduction enhancement provided by the presence of the vibrational mode .",
    "the only difference with respect to fig .",
    "[ fig : cases2 ] is the ratio between @xmath141 and @xmath140 associated to the maximal enhancement , which are as listed in fig .",
    "[ fig : cases ] .",
    "* a.*. however , while the quantitative enhancement is very similar in all such cases , the qualitative behaviours are not necessary similar . for example , case 4 may present reversed conduction flux in some region of the parameter space ( for @xmath154 ) .",
    "cases 5 and 6 , conversely , present always a positive current , whereas in case 2 an almost constant current is observed for @xmath132 . considering the reduction of the fano factor ,",
    "its behaviour does not generally correspond to the maximal enhancement . except for case 2",
    ", the smallest fano factor does not coincide to @xmath132 with @xmath133 as listed in fig .",
    "[ fig : cases ] .",
    "* a.*. the smallest fano factor was observed in both cases 5 and 6 for @xmath155 .    as the main objective of our investigation was the demonstration of conduction enhancement arising from the presence of the vibrational mode",
    ", we will not go deeper into the analysis of the six cases presented herein .",
    "instead , we now focus on a more physical configuration where the interdependence of the parameter is fully taken into account .",
    "in this section we will draw a less systematic but more practical picture of the situation under scrutiny to highlight the relevance of the effect induced by the vibrational mode on the electric conduction .",
    "firstly , from a device perspective we will illustrate how the enhancement takes place under realistic conditions and how the control of the vibrational mode can lead to a control of the electronic flux .",
    "next we will link the considered system to ( i ) high efficiency light - energy harvesting in molecular photosynthetic complexes and ( ii ) high - efficiency molecular identification in olfaction processes .",
    "both these classes of processes are currently believed to benefit from quantum features  @xcite .",

    "we represent the corresponding fano factor .",
    "we notice the appearance of a plateau in the conduction in correspondence of the passage from one of the cases described in the previous section to the next .",
    "the smoothing of the edges of those plateaux directly results from the finite temperature used for the electronic leads .",
    "panel * a. * corresponds to a case where the coherent hopping strength @xmath141 between the left and right sites is one order of magnitude less than for the lower panel * b. * , while keeping the ratio @xmath158 identical . from these two graphs",
    "we can clearly see that the enhancing effect is stronger as we decrease @xmath141 ( and @xmath140 ) .",
    "the picture regarding the fano factor , on the other hand , is less straightforward . for high @xmath141 ,",
    "the changes are relatively small and monotonic with respect to @xmath131 . for smaller @xmath141",
