    "in 1998 and 2000 the experiments with spherical neutral detector ( snd)@xcite at vepp-2 m @xmath1 collider were carried out in the energy range @xmath4  mev where cross section of @xmath1 annihilation into hadrons is determined by the @xmath5 and @xmath6 meson decays .",
    "the integrated luminosity of 9 pb@xmath7 collected in the experiment corresponds to @xmath8 and @xmath9 produced @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons , respectively .",
    "one of the goals of the experiment was the investigation of the rare process @xmath10 our preliminary study  @xcite of the process ( [ ppg ] ) was based on 1/3 of collected statistics .",
    "its results were the first measurement of @xmath11 and the measurement of @xmath12 confirming the only previous measurement of this decay by gams : @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical study of the @xmath14 decays was begun by p.singer in ref .",
    "@xcite where the transitions via @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "[ diad]a ) and @xmath16 intermediate states were suggested . the vector meson dominance ( vmd )",
    "calculation with these intermediate states leads to branching ratios @xmath17 and @xmath18 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively  @xcite .",

    "the chiral loop or @xmath21 contribution is calculated in the framework of chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath22 )  @xcite , unitarized chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath23 )  @xcite , linear sigma model ( @xmath24 )  @xcite and @xmath25 pole model  @xcite . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the spreads in parameter values correspond to different models describing @xmath26 cross section above 1  gev .",
    "all models reproduce the experimental data well .",
    "therefore parameter midrange was taken as a final result .",
    "its spread was regarded as the model error .",
    "the branching ratios obtained this way with statistical and systematic errors are listed in the last row of table  [ t4 ] .",
    "the systematic error includes the model error , uncertainties in the detection efficiency and integrated luminosity .",
    "the variation of the background level within its systematic error practically does not change the @xmath27 central value and results in following additional uncertainties of the @xmath5 meson branching ratios : 7% for @xmath28 and 12% for @xmath29 .",
    "since these uncertainties affect statistical significance of the results they were added to statistical errors .",
    "the energy dependence of the cross section in the model with @xmath30  mev and @xmath31  mev is shown in fig .",

    "the @xmath33 value for the latter model is equal to 0.5% .",
    "from table  [ t1 ] it is seen that selected events are mainly concentrated in two energy regions : 180 events near @xmath6 peak and 92 events in the range 920970  mev above the @xmath26 reaction threshold .",

    "decays must be taken into account to obtain the theoretical spectrum .",
    "the spectrum calculated in model 3 from table  [ t4 ] ( fig.[f3 ] ) is in a good agreement with the experimental one . in this model",
    "it is supposed that @xmath20 decay proceeds through @xmath16 intermediate state .",
    "another way is to describe the @xmath6 decay by a sum of contributions of @xmath36 and @xmath37 mechanisms . to do this",
    "we fix @xmath38 at @xmath39 and fit the @xmath37 decay contribution to a value yielding observed @xmath20 branching ratio . in case of constructive interference",
    "this leads to @xmath40 and the photon spectrum close to that expected for @xmath16 mechanism . as was shown in the previous section , assumption of destructive interference results in @xmath27 inconsistent with the pdg table value .",
    "the second theoretical spectrum in fig.[f3 ] corresponds to the model 2 from table  [ t3 ] with destructive interference of @xmath41 and @xmath35 amplitudes in @xmath5 decay . for this model",
    "the consistency between theoretical and experimental spectra calculated using kolmogorov test @xcite is about 1% , which was one of the reasons to discard this model .",
    "additional information about mechanism of @xmath6 decay can be obtained from the analysis of angular distributions .",
    "one of such distribution is shown in fig.[f4 ] .",
    "the same figure displays the theoretical distributions obtained under assumptions that @xmath6 decay proceeds through either pure @xmath16 intermediate state or a mixture of @xmath16 and @xmath35 .",
    "one can see that our limited statistics does not allow to distinguish these two models .",
    "the branching ratios measured in this work , @xmath42 @xmath43 are in a good agreement with our preliminary results  @xcite and gams measurement @xmath44  @xcite , but have higher accuracy .",
    "the probability of @xmath19 decay significantly exceeds vmd model prediction @xmath45 .",
    "this excess can be explained by the contribution of the decay via scalar state @xmath21 .",
    "two mechanisms , @xmath21 and @xmath46 , can be separated using difference in energy dependence of their amplitudes .",
    "our result on @xmath47 decay @xmath48 differs from zero by 2.4 standard deviations and is consistent with the predictions of chiral models  @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath49 is sensitive to @xmath25 parameters .",
    "as can be seen from table  [ t4 ] , the models with @xmath50  mev give the most consistent description of the experimental data .",
    "the value of the branching ratio @xmath51 , obtained by averaging of our measurement with the gams result exceeds theoretical predictions , @xmath52  @xcite and @xmath53  @xcite , by 1.3 standard deviations .",
    "it is necessary to make some remarks about these predictions .",
    "the result of ref .",
    "@xcite is based on table value of @xmath54 kev  @xcite .",
    "it must be corrected taking into account newer measurement @xmath55 kev  @xcite , which is close to the value for charged @xmath5 , @xmath56 kev  @xcite .",
    "this decreases the predicted @xmath27 and worsens agreement with the experiment . in the refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite the values of @xmath57 equal to 15  gev@xmath7 and 15.9  gev@xmath7 were used to calculate @xmath58 . on the other hand",
    ", the use of these @xmath57 values for vmd calculation of @xmath59 and @xmath60 leads to too large values conflicting with experimental data .",
    "for example , the @xmath57 obtained from @xmath61 width assuming intermediate @xmath62 state is equal to @xmath63  gev@xmath7  @xcite .",
    "therefore , our opinion is that @xmath64 is the maximum branching ratio acceptable within vmd model and the additional theoretical study is required to explain the large value of @xmath27 .",
