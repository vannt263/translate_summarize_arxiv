    "the properties of nuclear matter at high density play a crucial role in the modeling of neutron stars ( ns s ) interior @xcite .",
    "the observed ns masses are in the range of @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is the mass of the sun , @xmath3 g ) , and the radii are of the order of 10 km .",
    "the matter inside ns s , below the outer crust , possesses densities ranging from a fraction to a few times the normal nuclear matter density @xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) at such densities is one of the main ingredients to determine the structure parameters of ns s . due to beta - stability conditions ,",
    "ns matter is much closer to neutron matter than to symmetric nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "since no phenomenological data can be used to constrain the neutron matter eos , one has to rely on microscopic many - body calculations based on realistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions .",
    "predictions of the neutron matter eos based on purely phenomenological skyrme forces can dramatically differ among each other , even at relatively low density ( for a recent compilation see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) . for these reasons",
    ", an accurate determination of the neutron matter eos in the density range typical of ns s , based on many - body theory and realistic nn forces , appears of great relevance . unfortunately , despite the enormous progress in the many - body theory of nuclear matter in general and neutron matter in particular , discrepancies among different calculations are still persisting . among the variety of methods that have been developed in the many - body theory of nucleon systems , one can mention the variational method @xcite , in his various degrees of sophistication ( including monte - carlo procedures ) , the green s function monte - carlo method ( gfmc ) @xcite , which represents a numerical algorithm converging in principle to the  exact \" solution , and the bethe - brueckner - goldstone ( bbg ) expansion @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite that the spin - orbit interaction and correlations are particularly relevant in neutron and nuclear matter and require accurate many - body and numerical treatments .",
    "indeed , a large fraction of the observed discrepancies seems to reside in the proper treatment of the spin - orbit interaction terms .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the many - body effects due to the spin - orbit terms of the nn interaction within the bbg expansion . to this purpose , and for the sake of comparison with the results obtained with other methods , we perform calculations for neutron matter with the @xmath6 and @xmath7 nn realistic two - body interactions , including and , respectively , not including the spin - orbit terms .",
    "these interactions are simplified versions of the @xmath8 potential , but they can be still considered realistic enough to provide meaningful results . in particular ,",
    "they both contain tensor interaction operators .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly introduce the bbg expansion method and discuss the corresponding neutron matter eos in the relevant density range . in sec .",
    "iii we make a detailed comparison with the results of other many - body methods , in particular the gfmc and the auxiliary field diffusion monte - carlo method ( afdmc ) .",
    "iv is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "the main difficulty in the many - body theory of nuclear matter is the treatment of the strong repulsive core , which dominates the short range behavior of the nn interaction .",
    "simple perturbation theory can not of course be applied , and one way of overcoming this difficulty is to introduce the two - body scattering g - matrix , which has a much smoother behavior even for a large repulsive core .",
    "it is possible to rearrange the perturbation expansion in terms of the reaction g - matrix , in place of the original bare nn interaction , and this procedure is systematically exploited in the bbg expansion @xcite .",
    "the expansion of the ground state energy at a given density , i.e. the eos at zero temperature , can be ordered according to the number of independent hole - lines appearing in the diagrams representing the different terms of the expansion .",
    "this grouping of diagrams generates the so - called hole - line expansion @xcite .",
    "the diagrams with a given number @xmath9 of hole - lines are expected to describe the main contribution to the @xmath9-particle correlations in the system . at the two hole - line level one",
    "gets the brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) approximation .",
    "the bhf approximation includes the self - consistent procedure of determining the single particle auxiliary potential , which is an essential ingredient of the method .",
    "once the auxiliary self - consistent potential is introduced , the expansion is implemented by introducing the set of diagrams which include  potential insertions \" @xcite . to be specific , the introduction of the auxiliary potential can be formally performed by splitting the hamiltonian in a modified way from the usual one h = t + v = t + u + ( v - u ) h_0 + v , [ eq : split ] where @xmath10 is the kinetic energy and @xmath11 the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "then one considers @xmath12 as the new interaction potential and @xmath13 as the new single particle hamiltonian . the modified single particle energy @xmath14 is given by e(k ) = ^2 k^22 m + u(k ) [ eq : spe ] while @xmath15 must be chosen in such a way that the new interaction @xmath16 is , in some sense ,  reduced \" with respect to the original one @xmath11 , so that the expansion in @xmath16 should be faster converging .",
    "the introduction of the auxiliary potential turns out to be essential , otherwise the hole - expansion would be badly diverging .",
    "the total energy @xmath17 can then be written as e = _ k e(k ) + b [ eq : ene ] where @xmath18 is the interaction energy due to @xmath16 .",
    "the first potential insertion diagram cancels out the potential part of the single particle energy of eq .",
    "( [ eq : spe ] ) , in the expression for the total energy @xmath17 .",
    "this is actually true for any definition of the auxiliary potential @xmath15 . at the two hole - line level of approximation ,",
    "one therefore gets e = _ k < k_f ^2 k^22 m + b [ eq : enep ] the result that only the unperturbed kinetic energy appears in the expression for @xmath17 and that all correlations are included in the potential energy part @xmath19 holds true to all orders and it is a peculiarity of the bbg expansion . of course , the modification of the momentum distribution , and therefore of the kinetic energy , is included in the interaction energy part , but it is treated on the same footing as the other correlation effects .",
    "this presents a noticeable advantage : in fact , the modification of the kinetic energy itself is quite large and , of course , positive and it should be therefore compensated by an extremely accurate calculation of the ( negative ) correlation energy , if the two quantities are calculated independently .",
    "up to three - hole lines , the diagrams for @xmath20 can be schematically represented as in fig .",
    "[ fig:3h ] .",
    "diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) in the first line represent the usual bhf approximation , while the remaining lines include the three hole - line diagrams .",
    "the box in the third line represents the three - body scattering matrix @xmath21 , which can be introduced following a procedure similar to what is done for the brueckner g - matrix and satisfies the bethe - fadeev integral equations @xcite .",
    "diagram ( f ) generates , to lowest order in the g - matrix , diagrams ( c ) and ( e ) , which are usually calculated separately , since they require an accurate numerical procedure ( and they cancel each other to a large extent ) .",
    "diagram ( d ) is a potential insertion diagram , the only one at the three hole - line level , and it is non - zero only if the single particle potential is non - zero at momenta larger then the fermi momentum @xmath22 ( _ e.g. _ in the so - called  continuous choice \" @xcite ) .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we have shown that the bbg expansion for neutron matter displays a relatively rapid rate of convergence , and that calculating the total energy up to the three hole - line diagrams is enough to get an accurate eos , even for densities a few times larger than the saturation density .",
    "these calculations were done for the argonne @xmath23 and @xmath24 potentials , which contain a large set of interaction operators , including the spin - orbit ones . in order to simplify the analysis and the comparison with other methods",
    ", we have performed the same type of calculations for the @xmath25 nn potential @xcite , which is a simplified version of the @xmath24 interaction , but still realistic enough to keep the calculations meaningful . to better focus on the effects of the spin - orbit interaction , we have also considered the @xmath7 potential , which is obtained from @xmath25 by dropping the spin - orbit terms .",
    "the difference of the eos obtained with these two interactions can , therefore , be taken as an estimate of the contribution and relevance of the spin - orbit nn interaction in neutron matter .",

    "@xcite , the results are independent , to a high degree of accuracy , of the choice of @xmath27 . at the bhf level",
    "the difference between the eos for the @xmath28 nn interaction ( dash - dotted line ) and the eos for the @xmath29 nn interaction ( dotted line ) looks sizable , even at relatively low density .",
    "this discrepancy increases with density , reaching about 14 mev at @xmath30 @xmath31 .",
    "when three - body correlations are included ( dashed and full lines ) , the gap between the two eos is reduced , the strength of this reduction being about 40% at the highest considered density .",
    "notice that the contribution of three hole - lines diagrams is positive for @xmath28 and negative for @xmath29 , therefore this difference turns out to be quite sensitive to three - body correlations ( as defined within the bbg expansion ) .",
    "it is important to stress that the contribution of three - body correlations is only a few percent with respect to the two - body one ( bhf ) , even at the highest density . indeed , in the considered density region the interaction energy @xmath20 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : enep ] ) is negative and large and compensates a large fraction of the positive kinetic energy contribution .",
    "this substantial cancellation between kinetic energy and interaction energy has the effect of amplifying the ( small ) differences of the correlation energy obtained in the different eos calculations for a given nn interaction , as discussed in the next section .",

    "switching the spin - orbit interaction terms off and considering the @xmath7 nn potential , we can again compare the bbg results with uc - gfmc and variational calculations , which are also available @xcite .",
    "unfortunately in this case the box correction to the gmfc has not been provided ; however it looks reasonable to use the same corrections as in the @xmath6 case .",

    "it is interesting to notice that the inclusion of three - body correlations in the bbg expansion plays a relevant role in improving the agreement with the uc - gmfc results , which is , in any case , already satisfactory at the bhf level .",
    "this happens both for the @xmath0 potential , for which , as already mentioned , the contribution of three hole - line diagrams is positive , and for the @xmath26 case , where , instead , the correction is negative .",
