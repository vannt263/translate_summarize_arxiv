    "one of the most interesting questions in high - energy nuclear physics is about the properties of the hot and dense medium created in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "finite - temperature lattice - qcd ( lqcd ) calculations of strongly - interacting matter predict a phase transition from hadronic matter to a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) at a critical temperature , @xmath4  @xcite . the heavy charm and bottom quarks are particularly valuable probes for the properties of this medium . in the context of qgp physics they are considered heavy because their mass , @xmath5 , is large not only with respect to @xmath6 but also to the temperature , @xmath0 , of the plasma .",
    "this remains true going from sps to lhc energies spanning a @xmath0 range of @xmath7-@xmath8 .",
    "this property makes the study of heavy quark special , because @xmath9 allows to determine the initial heavy - quark ( hq ) spectra by means of pqcd and makes available an out - of - equilibrium probe ; the production time @xmath10 is much smaller than the qgp lifetime .",
    "therefore heavy quarks pass through the entire evolution of the fireball ; the hq equilibration time @xmath11 is of the order of the qgp lifetime but smaller than the light - quark one @xmath12 which means that in principle they carry more information ; @xmath13 has two important implications : on one hand it imposes effective flavor conservation , that in particular holds not only during the qgp phase but also in the hadronization process ; on the other hand it implies also that the momentum exchange by collisions @xmath14 ( parametrically dominated by elastic scatterings ) , and the dynamics can be treated as a brownian motion by means of a fokker - planck equation which constitutes a significant simplification of the study of transport properties . finally , the three - momentum transfer dominates over energy transfer @xmath15 which allows to use the concept of a potential and therefore to link the hq physics to the studies to of the hq free energy in lqcd  @xcite .",
    "the latter property allows to employ a finite - temperature @xmath0-matrix approach to study the problem of hq interactions in the medium providing a consistent framework to evaluate both bound - state and scattering solutions based on a two - body static potential .",
    "the first results at rhic further enhanced the potential interest in hq dynamics by showing an unexepectedly strong interaction of heavy quarks with the medium observed through a small nuclear modification factor , @xmath16 , and a large elliptic flow , @xmath17 , of the single electrons , @xmath18 , from semileptonic hq decays . before these experimental results such a behavior was considered as an unrealistic upper limit , useful only as a reference  @xcite .",
    "instead , the prediction of a large @xmath2 and a small @xmath3 obtained from gluon bremsstrahlung from heavy quarks has been in striking contrast with the observations  @xcite .",
    "furthemore , it has not been possible to observe the expected mass hierarchy in the suppression and its color dependence that would lead to @xmath19 @xcite . this was in part due to the rather indirect experimental access to the hq dynamics through the measurements on the single @xmath18 , which does not allow to disentagle the individual contributions from @xmath20 and @xmath21 mesons .",
    "a first breakthorugh in this direction has been possible thanks to the recent preliminary results on d mesons presented at qm2011 by the alice collaboration @xcite which confirm a large suppression of heavy mesons . in these proceedings",
    "we discuss hq scattering in the qgp focusing on the possibility of resonance scattering with light ( anti-)quarks reminiscent of quark confinement .",
    "we discuss the comparison of the model with the data at rhic and the 2007 prediction for lhc .",
    "early approaches to the study of hq scattering in the medium was carried our using perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , first using elastic scattering  @xcite and later based on gluon - bremsstrahlung energy loss and/or including elastic hq scattering @xcite . in such approaches only a moderate decrease of @xmath2 and a small @xmath3 of the single electrons from @xmath21 and @xmath20 decays have been expected in clear disagreement with the experimental observations .",
    "hence non - perturbative approaches are expected to be necessary to explain the strong hq interaction with the medium .",
    "an early suggestion postulated a mechanism via the formation of @xmath21- and @xmath20-meson resonance excitations in the deconfined phase of qcd matter  @xcite .",
    "this idea has first been realized through a non - relativistic effective field theory , modeling colorless ( pseudo- ) scalar and ( axial- ) vector @xmath21- and @xmath20-mesons exploiting both chiral symmetry and hq ( spin ) symmetry , @xmath22 the fields , ( @xmath23 ) @xmath24 , represent ( _ anti_)-@xmath21-mesons , transforming as isospinors under isospin rotations and with the usual @xmath25 free terms for quarks and @xmath21-mesons ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "the interaction terms in eq .",
    "( [ lag - d ] ) were evaluated to leading order in @xmath26 according to hq effective theory ( hqet ) .",
    "the main parameter is given by the coupling @xmath27 varied to allow for widths of the @xmath21-meson spectral functions of @xmath28-@xmath29 , to approximately cover the range suggested by effective quark models .",
    "it is important to note that we assume the @xmath21-meson resonances , @xmath30 gev to be located above the @xmath31 mass threshold , @xmath32 gev , which renders them accessible in @xmath31 scattering processes .",
    "the situation is quite different for ( bound ) meson states ( i.e. , below the anti-/quark threshold ) , where the resonant part of the scattering amplitude can not be probed through @xmath33 interactions ( even for resonance masses close to threshold , thermal energies of anti-/quarks imply that the average collision energy is significantly above the resonance peak ) .",
    "we find that the presence of these resonances at moderate qgp temperatures substantially accelerates the kinetic equilibration of @xmath34-quarks as compared to using perturbative interactions .",
    "we have concentrated on the charm - quark case , but completely analogous expressions apply to the bottom sector .",
    "these approaches have been used in 2006 to make predictions for the case of au+au at rhic energies , and the details are presented in ref .",
    "the key ingredients are that the transport cross section is appreciably larger than the pqcd ones and a hadronization mechanism that includes quark coalescence  @xcite , leading to an enhancement of both the quark @xmath2 and @xmath3 toward a better agreement with the data @xcite .",
    "other approaches have consistently pointed out the necessity to go beyond a simple pqcd scheme @xcite to account for the observed @xmath2 even if these studies included coalescence especially in the @xmath35-@xmath36 region , which translates to @xmath37-@xmath38 at the meson level . in particular our approach appeared to be the only one able to describe both the small @xmath2 and large @xmath17 simultaneuosly . furthermore a prediction for pb+pb collisions at lhc energy has been presented in the last call for prediction proceedings @xcite and will be discussed in the following .",
    "the success of the first applications of the idea of resonant hq scattering in the medium has lead to a further and more realistic assessment of the existence of resonance scattering .",
    "the idea of the existence of resonance scattering is indeed supported by lqcd on the quark correlators for both heavy and light quarks @xcite as well as by non - relativsitic qcd solved on lattice for heavy quarks @xcite .",
    "they both show the existence of a peak in the spectral function even at temperatures substantially higher than @xmath39 suggesting the presence of a physical mechanism beyond a simple free scattering .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the large hq mass allows the use of an interaction potential between quarks .",
    "this has the advantage that @xmath0-matrix scattering theory becomes applicable , which does not rely on a perturbative expansion but is able to account also for moderate or even strong coupling , where resummations of large diagrams are necessary and realized via the standard ladder sum .",
    "an extra benefit is that one can in principle extract the quark potential from finite - temperature lattice qcd ( lqcd ) , or at least be constrained by lqcd `` data '' which gives a parameter - free input .",
    "a static heavy - quark light - quark potential , @xmath40 , has been used in the vacuum to successfully describe @xmath21-meson spectra and decays  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the effective in - medium potential can be extracted from finite - temperature lqcd calculations of the color - singlet free energy @xmath41",
    "@xcite for a static @xmath42 pair as the internal potential energy by the usual thermodynamic relation  @xcite , @xmath43 for the application as a scattering kernel in a @xmath0-matrix equation , the potential has to vanish for @xmath44 .",
    "thus we choose the accordingly subtracted internal potential energy , @xmath45 in lqcd simulations one finds that @xmath46 is a decreasing function with temperature which could be associated as a contribution to the in - medium hq mass , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 denotes the bare mass .",
    "however , close to @xmath39 the asymptotic value , @xmath49 , develops a pronounced peak structure which is currently not fully understood ( possibly related to multiple coupled channel effects ) . for simplicity , in the current calculation , we assume constant effective hq masses , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we also consider the complete set of color channels for the @xmath52 ( singlet and octet ) and @xmath53 ( anti - triplet and sextet ) systems , using casimir scaling as in leading - order pqcd , @xmath54 , which is also justified by lqcd calculations of the finite-@xmath0 hq free energy  @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties due to the extraction of the potential have a moderate final impact on the agreement with the experimental data , see also fig.[fig : raa - v2-el ] ( left ) , while the difference in the transport coefficients going from the internal energy , @xmath55 , to the free energy , @xmath56 , is quite substantial .",
    "however , the successful application to compute quarkonium correlators and hq susceptibilities lends a - posteriori support ( albeit not validation ) for the choice of @xmath55 , which is not as convincing for @xmath56 ( cf .  ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "-matrix based on lqcd static internal potential energy as the interaction kernel and the hq self - energy . ]",
    "the starting point of hq brueckner theory is a system of coupled bethe - salpeter ( bs ) and schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equations characterizing the hq interaction and propagator in the qgp , @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the scattering amplitude between a heavy ( @xmath59 ) and a light ( @xmath60 ) quark or antiquark , @xmath61 the two - body interaction kernel , @xmath62 the two - particle ( @xmath63 ) propagator , @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) the ( free ) single - particle propagator , and @xmath66 the hq selfenergy receiving contributions from thermal gluons ( @xmath67 ) and light quarks ( where the latter are computed self - consistently from the heavy - light scattering amplitude ) . since we focus on a qgp at zero chemical potential ( @xmath68=0 ) , all quantities are quark - antiquark symmetric .",
    "the predominantly space - like momentum transfer in on - shell scattering of heavy quarks , @xmath69 , justifies a static ( potential ) approximation to its interaction , @xmath70 .",
    "this allows to reduce the four - dimensional ( 4d ) bs equation into a 3d lippmann - schwinger equation for the @xmath0-matrix , which greatly simplifies its solution .",
    "using azimuthal symmetry and a partial - wave expansion leads to a one - dimensional integral equation for the amplitudes , @xmath71 , of given angular momentum , @xmath72 , @xmath73 where we also indicated the four possible color channels , @xmath74 , for @xmath75 ( singlet and octet , @xmath76 and 8) and @xmath77 ( antitriplet and sextet , @xmath78 and 6 ) states .    the in - medium hq quasiparticle - dispersion relation",
