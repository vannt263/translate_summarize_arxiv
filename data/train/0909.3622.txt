    "no longer gravitational - wave astronomy is a fantasy . in fact , gravitational wave detectors , such as ligo @xcite , vigro , geo600 , tama300 @xcite , and aigo with their international network of the observatories , are beginning to take data at sensitivities where astrophysical events are predicted ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "for the detectors , core - collapse supernovae especially in our galaxy , have been proposed as one of the most plausible sources of gravitational waves ( see , for example , @xcite for recent reviews ) . since the gravitational waves ( plus neutrinos ) are the only tool that gives us the live information of the central engine of core - collapse supernovae , the detection is important not only for the direct confirmation of general relativity but also for disclosing the supernova physics itself .    traditionally ,",
    "most of the theoretical predictions of gravitational waves ( gws ) have focused on the bounce signals ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however recent stellar evolution calculations suggest that rapid rotation assumed in most of the previous studies is not canonical for the progenitors with neutron star formation @xcite .",
    "to explain the observed rotation periods of radio pulsars , the rotation periods of the iron core before collapse are estimated to be larger than @xmath2 100 sec @xcite .",
    "in such a slowly rotating case , the detection of the bounce signals becomes very hard even by the next - generation laser interferometers for a galactic supernova ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "besides the rapid rotation of the core , convective matter motions and anisotropic neutrino emission in the much later postbounce phase are expected to be the primary gw sources with comparable amplitudes to the bounce signals . thus far , various physical ingredients for producing asphericities and the resulting gws in the postbounce phase , have been studied such as the roles of pre - collapse density inhomogeneities @xcite , moderate rotation of the iron core @xcite , g - mode oscillations of protoneutron stars ( pnss ) @xcite , and sasi @xcite .    among them , we focused on the gws originated from the asphericities produced by the standing accretion shock instability ( sasi ) @xcite . here",
    "sasi , becoming very popular in current supernova researches , is a uni- and bipolar sloshing of the stalled supernova shock with pulsational strong expansion and contraction ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "based on the two - dimensional ( 2d ) simulations , which demonstrate the neutrino - driven explosions aided by sasi using the light - bulb scheme ( see @xcite for details ) , it was pointed out that the gw amplitudes from anisotropic neutrino emission increase almost monotonically with time , which are dominant over the ones from matter motions , and that such signals may be visible to next - generation detectors for a galactic source .",
    "more recently , @xcite analyzed the gw emission based on their long - term 2d boltzmann ( ray - by - ray ) simulations , which seem very close to produce the sasi - aided neutrino - driven explosions @xcite .",
    "they also found that the gws from neutrinos with continuously growing amplitudes ( but with the different sign of the amplitudes in @xcite ) , are dominant over the ones from matter motions .",
    "they proposed that the third - generation class detectors such as the einstein telescope are required for detecting the gw signals with a good signal - to - noise ratio .    except for the acoustic mechanism @xcite and the magnetohydrodynamic mechanism ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , both of which produce strong mass - quadrupole gws",
    ", all the studies in the postbounce phase mentioned above , rely basically on the conventional neutrino - heating mechanism @xcite .",
    "they agree that the gw amplitudes from anisotropic neutrino emission are dominant over the ones from mass motions .",
    "this means that accurate estimation of the neutrino anisotropy is indispensable for understanding the gravitational radiation from core - collapse supernovae , which requires to estimate precisely the directional dependence of the neutrino intensity emitted from the central cores . in the previous simulations with the light - bulb approximations @xcite",
    ", there was no way but to estimate the angle - dependent neutrino luminosities , assuming that neutrinos are emitted purely radially in each lateral bin of the computational polar grid .",
    "this ray - by - ray treatment can not capture the neutrino emission in the lateral directions entirely .",
    "the fld(flux - limited - diffusion ) schemes ( either multi - energy @xcite or single - energy fld @xcite ) tend to smooth out the local and global neutrino anisotropies due to their diffusion characters .",
    "any ray - by - ray transport schemes @xcite , albeit coupled to the boltzmann transport and thus being one of the most sophisticated treatment at present , replaces the 2d neutrino transport with the 1d transport problem along radial rays in every lateral bin , leading to the overestimation of the directional dependence of the neutrino anisotropies ( see discussions in @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , fully 2d multi - angle boltzmann transport simulations become practicable @xcite , however too computationally expensive currently to perform the simulations , satisfying required number of the momentum - space angles in order to capture the neutrino anisotropies accurately ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these situations motivate us to propose a method to estimate the neutrino anisotropies , directly linked to the accurate estimation of the neutrino - originated gravitational radiation .",
    "pushed by the striking evidences that support the slow rotation of iron cores @xcite , we consider an idealized situation that the neutrino radiation field from the pnss are isotropic .",
    "this means that no gws are assumed to be generated inside due to the isotropy .",
    "then we focus on the asphericities outside the pnss , which are produced by the growth of sasi . to this end",
    ", we utilize the 2d sasi models as in our previous paper @xcite , in which the neutrino luminosities from the pnss are adjusted to trigger explosions aided by sasi @xcite . since the regions outside the pnss are basically optically thin to neutrinos , we solve the transport equations by making use of the ray - tracing ( long - characteristics ) method in a post - processing manner . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we consider here only neutrino absorptions and emission by free nucleons , dominant processes outside the pns , while the neutrino scattering and the velocity - dependent terms in the transport equation are neglected .",
    "we then study how the obtained gravitational waveforms could change from the ones obtained in the ray - by - ray analysis ( e.g. , @xcite ) and discuss their implications .",
    "although the presented scheme is designed to be valid for the regions where neutrinos are thin to matter , we hope it to be useful for the gw prediction in the first generation of 3d core - collapse supernova simulations that do not solve the transport equations as part of the numerical evolution .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec2 ] , first the formalism for calculating gravitational waveforms",
    "is described .",
    "thereafter , we describe the ray - tracing method to calculate the direction - dependent neutrino luminosities . in section [ sec3 ] , we shall briefly summarize the information how to construct the 2d exploding models , such as about the initial models and numerical methods .",
    "the main results are shown in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "we summarize our results and discuss their implications in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "to compute the gravitational waveforms from anisotropic neutrino radiation , we follow the formalism pioneeringly proposed by @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we present the formulae in a useful form , which is applicable also for 3d computations .",
    "the two polarization states ( of @xmath3 and @xmath4 modes ) of gws from anisotropic neutrino radiation satisfying the transverse - traceless conditions are given by @xcite as follows , @xmath5 and @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the gravitational constant , @xmath8 is the speed of light , @xmath9 is the distance of the source to the observer , @xmath10 represents the direction - dependent neutrino luminosity emitted per unit of solid angle into direction of @xmath11 .",
    "variables with dash such as @xmath12 represent the quantities of the source coordinate system , while non - dashed ones belong to the the observer coordinate system ( for the geometrical setup , see figure [ f1 ] ) . for convenience , we assume that @xmath13 axis coincides with @xmath14 axis and that the @xmath15-axis lies on the ( @xmath16 ) plane .",
    "using the following relations between the two coordinates , @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 and @xmath21 in equations ( [ t_+ ] , [ t_cross ] ) are required to be expressed in terms of the angles @xmath22 with respect to the source coordinate valuables , and the viewing angle of @xmath23 .",
    "after some algebra , one can readily derive the two modes of the gws ( equations ( [ t_+ ] , [ t_cross ] ) ) as follows , @xmath24 and @xmath25 which will be useful in computing the gw signals also for 3d computations .",
    "it is noted that the sum of the squared amplitudes @xmath26 is invariant under the rotation about the @xmath15-axis . to maximize the gw amplitudes in our 2d axisymmetric case , we assume that the observer is situated along the direction of the equatorial plane ( @xmath27 ) as in @xcite .",
    "then the only non - vanishing component is , @xmath28 here the subscripts of ( @xmath29 ) and ( @xmath30 ) indicates that the observer is situated in the equatorial plane and that the gws are originated from neutrinos .",
    "@xmath31 depends on the angle measured from the symmetry axis ( @xmath32 ) @xmath33 as given in figure 1 of @xcite , this function has positive values in the north polar cap for @xmath34 and in the south polar cap for @xmath35 , but becomes negative values between @xmath36 . in order to perform numerically the angular integration in equation ( 8) with high numerical accuracy",
    ", we recommend to perform it based on a gaussian quadrature , because the function of @xmath37 of equation ( [ graph1 ] ) is not smooth near poles and equator . for estimating @xmath38 ( equation ( 8) ) , we are yet to determine the directional dependent neutrino luminosities of @xmath10 , which we will estimate by the ray - tracing method in the next section .    here it is noted that gws generated by neutrinos are distinct from the ones from matter dynamics , because the former has the _ memory effect _ , which means that the gravitational amplitude jumps from zero to a nonvanishing value and it keeps the non - vanishing value even after the energy source of gravitational waves disappeared ( see @xcite for details ) . in equations ( [ t_+],[t_cross ] ) ,",
    "this nature can be directly seen as the time - integral .",
    "other astrophysical emitters of gws with memory have been elaborately studied for gamma - ray bursts @xcite , pop iii stars @xcite , and inspiralling compact objects @xcite ( see references therein ) .    as for the gravitational waves of the quadrupole radiation of mass motions , we employ the stress formula ( see ,",
    "e.g. , equation ( 12 ) in @xcite ) . in using the formula ,",
    "we consider the self - gravity of matter in the accretion flow . in the following computations",
    ", we assume that the source is assumed to be located at our galactic center ( @xmath39 ) and also that the observer is situated in the direction of the equatorial plane .",
    "now we proceed to determine @xmath10 in equation ( 8) , the directional dependent neutrino luminosities through the ray - tracing method .",
    "note in the following equations that we change dashed variables to non - dashed ones for the sake of simplicity .    in the ray - tracing approach ,",
    "we consider transfer along the ray specified by a constant impact parameter @xmath40 .",
    "the coordinate along @xmath40 is called @xmath41 , satisfying @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the radial coordinate . to estimate @xmath44 along a given direction of @xmath45 ,",
    "we draw rays of neutrinos as shown in figure [ ray_trace ] .",
    "as will be discussed soon later , in order to get the numerical convergence of @xmath44 , we need to set 45,000 rays for each direction , which consists of @xmath46 rays , where the former is for the impact parameters covering from the inner- ( @xmath47 = 50 km ) to the outer- boundary ( @xmath48 = 2000 km ) of the computational domain and the latter is for covering the circumference ( e.g. , @xmath49 ) of the concentric circles on the plane perpendicular to the rays ( see figure [ ray_trace ] ) . in the axisymmetric case here",
    ", we perform the ray - tracing calculations 60 times to cover the entire sphere , which is the number of the mesh points for the polar direction ( e.g. , section 3 ) .",
    "the transfer equation of the neutrino occupation probability @xmath50 for a given neutrino energy @xmath51 along each ray is given by , @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the emissivity and absorptivity via neutrino absorptions and emission by free nucleons ( @xmath55 ) ( @xcite ) , which are dominant processes outside the pnss .",
    "the optical depth for those reactions are estimated by @xmath56 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , the neutrino scattering and the velocity - dependent terms in the transport equation are neglected here .",
    "although @xmath57 s are taken into account the hydro simulations , we focus only on electron - type neutrinos here for simplicity , since they dominantly contribute to the resulting gws outside the pnss as will be discussed in section 4 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we use 16 neutrino energy bins which is logarithmically uniform and covers 0.9 - 110 mev . along each ray",
    ", @xmath58 is transferred by the line integral .",
    "when the line integral starts from the surface on the pns ( the lines coming from the pns in figure [ ray_trace ] ) , we set the initial value of @xmath59 assuming that the neutrino distribution function at the surface is approximated by the fermi - dirac distribution with a vanishing chemical potential . here",
    "the neutrino temperature is set to be constant near @xmath60 mev , whose values change slightly depending on the input neutrino luminosity .",
    "note that these values are constant in time for each model .",
    "this is necessary to realize the steady unperturbed states ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for the rays that do not hit the pns , we start the line integral from the outer most boundary antipodal to the line of sight , where @xmath58 is essentially zero .    by a post process , we perform the line integral up to the outer - most boundary for each hydro - timestep .",
    "the time sampling for the postprocessing is about @xmath2 1 ms , which is sufficient here because the waveforms from neutrinos show much slower temporal variation ( @xmath61 ms ) as we will discuss in section 4 .",
    "since the regions outside the pnss are basically thin to neutrinos ( e.g. , section 4.1 ) , the transport equation is suited to be solved by making use of the ray - tracing ( long - characteristics ) method .",
    "for all the rays , our treatment in equation ( 11 ) is identical to neglect the time - retardation , which is equal to the light traveling time of neutrinos from the pns to the outer boundary .",
    "so the difference of the light traveling time comes from the difference in the position of the neutrino emitting regions , which are close to the pns surface of @xmath2 50 km .",
    "divided by the speed of light , the difference of the time - retardation , is less than the order of 0.1 ms , which is negligible for our computation , because the hydrodynamical timescale is longer than @xmath2 10 ms . with @xmath62 , which is obtained by the line integral up to the outer - most boundary ,",
    "the neutrino energy fluxes along a specified direction of @xmath45 can be estimated , @xmath63 by summing up the energy fluxes with the weight of the area in the plane perpendicular to the rays , we can find @xmath10 along a specified direction @xmath45 , @xmath64 repeating the above procedures , @xmath44 can be estimated for all the directions .    to verify the newly developed numerical code",
    ", we calculate @xmath44 in a spherical medium as a test calculation .",
    "the left panel of figure [ f2_added ] shows how the deviation of @xmath44 from its ( polar)angle - averaged value , indicated by @xmath65 in the figure , changes with the number of the neutrino rays . with increasing the number of the rays , the deviation is shown to be smaller especially near the polar regions ( near @xmath66 ) , while the deviation near the equator ( near @xmath67 ) is nearly converged , but with relatively larger errors than for the other direction",
    "this is because the angular grid size near the equatorial belt becomes larger for the spherical coordinate system taken in our simulation .",
    "right panel of figure [ f2_added ] shows the resulting gw amplitudes for the different number of the rays .",
    "it is noted that the amplitudes vanish formally for the isotropic configuration . from the restriction of the computational time",
    ", we choose to set 45,000 rays for our actual ray - tracing calculation ( green circle in the right panel ) . with this choice ,",
    "the numerical errors are suppressed to be an order of @xmath68 , which is typically 4 - 5 orders of magnitudes smaller than typical gw amplitudes obtained in the models computed here .",
    "we have also checked the numerical convergence for a deformed matter configuration ( see figure [ f4_added ] ) .",
    "as in @xcite , we assume that the explosion is powered by the neutrino - energy deposition between the pns and the standing accretion shock , probably one of the most promising way to blow up massive stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) . to trigger the explosions , we employ the so - called light - bulb approximation ( see @xcite for details ) and adjust the neutrino luminosities from the pnss , which was found to work well in 2d , capturing the main features obtained by more realistic simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted again that we focus on the gws generated by the anisotropies associated with the growth of sasi , which develops outside the pns .",
    "therefore , the oscillations of the pnss @xcite and the resulting efficient gravitational emission @xcite or the enhanced neutrino emission near the equator of the pns observed in @xcite , can not be treated in principle here .",
    "our hydrodynamic code is based on the zeus @xcite and major modifications for the supernova simulations are already described in @xcite .",
    "the computational grid is comprised of 300 logarithmically spaced radial zones to cover from the absorbing inner boundary of @xmath69 to the outer boundary of @xmath70 , and 60 polar ( @xmath20 ) uniform mesh points ( see for the resolution tests in @xcite ) .",
    "the initial condition is a spherically symmetric steady accretion flow through a stalled shock wave to a pns @xcite , which is also provided in the same manner of @xcite . in constructing the initial conditions , we assume a fixed density @xmath71  g  @xmath72 at the inner boundary . and the initial mass accretion rates and the initial mass of the central object are set to be @xmath73  s@xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively . as in @xcite , the self - gravity of matter in the accretion flow",
    "is ignored . to induce",
    "non - spherical instability , we add random velocity perturbations of less than 1 @xmath76 of the unperturbed velocity .",
    "at the outer boundary , we adopt the fixed boundary condition consistent with the initial condition . on the other hand ,",
    "the absorbing boundary is used at the inner boundary .",
    "we assume that the neutrino flux from the pnss can be approximated by black - body emission .",
    "pushed by the evidences that the sasi - induced explosions are favorable for explaining the observed quantities such as the synthesized elements of sn1987a @xcite , the pulsar kicks @xcite and spins @xcite , we mainly focus on the gravitational radiation in the models tuned to produce explosions . by changing the electron neutrino luminosity at the surface of the pns in the range of @xmath77  erg  s@xmath74",
    ", we construct three exploding and one non - exploding models ( see table [ table1 ] ) . except for model d",
    ", we can observe the continuous increase of the average shock radius with the growth of sasi , reaching the outer boundary of the computational domain with the explosion energy of @xmath78 erg . until this moment",
    ", we run the simulations ( e.g. , @xmath79 in the table ) , while in model d , we terminated the simulation at about 800 ms , not seeing the increase of the shock radius .",

    "the left panel of figure [ f3 ] shows the gw amplitudes contributed from anisotropic neutrino emission for different luminosity models . comparing the right panel , which shows the total amplitudes ( neutrino + matter )",
    ", it can be seen that the gross structures of the waveforms are predominantly determined by the neutrino - originated gws with the slower temporal variations ( @xmath61 ms ) , to which the gws from matter motions with rapid temporal variations ( @xmath80 ms ) are superimposed .    on the other hand ,",
    "the waveforms shown in the left panel of figure [ f3_added ] are estimated simply by summing up the local neutrino cooling rates outside the pnss with the ray - by - ray assumptions @xcite ( see also figure 2 in the paper ) .",
    "they are so much different from the ones obtained here .",
    "in contrast to the monotonic increase of the amplitudes with time , the waveforms here exhibit more variety , showing large negative growth at some epochs . and",
    "the gw amplitudes from neutrinos become more than one - order - of magnitude smaller than the previous estimation ( compare figures [ f3 ] and the left panel of [ f3_added ] noting the different vertical scales ) . on the other hand ,",
    "similarities between them are that the waveforms from neutrinos have generally a positively growing feature with time , and also that the electron - type neutrinos dominantly contribute to the wave amplitudes than for the anti - electron type neutrinos ( right panel of figure [ f3_added ] , see also figure 3 in @xcite ) . in the following ,",
    "we first analyze this positive trend based on the ray - tracing calculations . and in section [ naga ]",
    ", we clarify the reason for the negative growth , contributing to make the amplitudes much smaller than previously estimated .      to see the positively growing features clearly , we choose model a as a reference .",
    "the left panel of figure [ f4 ] shows @xmath10 in the vicinity of the north pole ( @xmath81 ) , the equator ( @xmath82 ) , and the south pole ( @xmath83 ) . in the following , we focus on the two epochs of @xmath84 = 294 and 370 ms , when the neutrino emission in the south pole dominate over the ones in the north pole and vice versa .",
    "the right panel of figure [ f4 ] shows that the dominance of the neutrino emission in the north and south poles are closely anti - correlated .",
    "this is the consequence of the low - mode nature of sasi , here of @xmath85 .",
    "in fact , the right panel of figure [ f5 ] shows that at 294 ms , the blob encompassing the regions inside the stalled shock is moving from the southern to the northern hemisphere , leading to the compression of the matter in the south hemisphere , which is vice versa at 370 ms ( right panel ) .",
    "figure [ f6 ] shows various properties obtained by the ray - tracing calculation for @xmath86 ms .",
    "top , middle , and bottom panel , is the case seen from the northern hemisphere , the equator , and the south hemisphere , respectively . comparing the right panels",
    ", we can see that the rays with highest @xmath58 , come from the high - temperature regions near the vicinity of the south pole ( bottom right panel ) . as mentioned above , this is due to the compression of matter near the south pole , produced by the sloshing sasi , moving from the south to the northern hemisphere . in the left panels of figure [ f6 ] , it is noted that due to the axisymmetry , the distributions of the neutrino energy fluxes seen from the north ( top left ) and south hemispheres ( bottom left ) have the circumferential structures .",
    "the images of the energy fluxes may seem like an annular eclipse , which we explain as follows .",
    "here for clarity , let s consider two rays of a and b. the ray a is coming a point from ( @xmath87 ) in the middle left panel , which in the middle right panel , is equal to the point along the line perpendicularly threading the center of the colored plane , but is positioned at 50 km away from the plane to the observer ( : right direction in the panel ) .",
    "the ray b is coming from a point from ( @xmath88 km ) in the middle left panel , which is equal to the point , near the southern point on the colored plane in the middle right .",
    "the ray b travels to the observer , experiencing longer the high - temperature regions near the surface of the pns .",
    "this makes the eclipse - like shining near the edge of the pns .",
    "the left panel of figure [ f7 ] is an enlargement of the bottom right panel of figure [ f6 ] near the pns , which clearly shows the rim - shining near @xmath89 km ( compare the right - hand side with the bottom left panel of figure [ f6 ] ) .",
    "the right - hand side in the right panel of figure [ f7 ] depicts the optical depth of neutrinos at @xmath90 mev .",
    "it is seen that the high values of @xmath58 come from the higher temperature regions in the vicinity of the southern part of the pns ( left panel ) , where are thin to the neutrinos with the optical depth being smaller than @xmath91 ( right panel ) .",
    "such an optically thinness is favorable for the ray - tracing calculation here as discussed in section [ sec2.2 ] .    among the left panels of figure [ f6 ] , the highest values of the local neutrino energy fluxes ( : @xmath92 )",
    "come from the brightly shining southern poles seen from the equator ( middle panel ) .",
    "however by summing up them with the weight of the area ( e.g. , @xmath93 in equation ( [ final ] ) ) , @xmath10 are shown to become largest seen from the southern hemisphere ( the red line in the left panel of figure [ f8 ] ) .",
    "the similar argument is true for @xmath94 ms ( figure [ f9 ] ) , while the neutrino luminosities seen from the northern hemisphere are higher than the ones from the southern hemisphere ( the green line in the left panel of figure [ f8 ] ) . noting again that @xmath31 in equation ( [ tt ] ) are positive near the north and south polar caps , the dominance of the anisotropic neutrino luminosities in the vicinity near the north and south poles , makes the positively growing feature in the resulting gws .",
    "figure [ f7_added ] shows time evolution of a neutrino anisotropy parameter defined in @xcite , @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the total neutrino luminosity @xmath97 .",
    "this quantity is useful to see how the temporal changes of the neutrino anisotropy have impacts on the gw amplitudes . either for models",
    "a or b , it can be seen that @xmath98 keeps positive value with time in the later phase ( @xmath99 ms ) .",
    "this coincides with the epoch when the low - modes explosion is triggered by sasi along the symmetry axis , which is also helpful for understanding the reason of the positive growth ( compare the left panel of figure [ f3 ] ) .",
    "now we move on to discuss large negative growth of the gw amplitudes seen in the waveforms ( e.g. , models b and c in figure [ f3 ] ) , which is newly found by the ray - tracing calculation ( compare figure 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "here we choose a snapshot at @xmath100 ms of model b as a reference , which shows the steep negative growth ( see the insert of figure [ f10 ] ) .",
    "the middle panel of figure [ f11 ] shows that the neutrino emission seen from the equatorial plane are much stronger than the ones seen from the northern / southern hemispheres .",
    "the bright belt - like structure in the middle panel is from the high - temperature regions in the northern hemisphere , which are by chance surrounded by relatively low density ( see cusp - like structure in the northern hemisphere of figure [ f10 ] and [ f12 ] ) . in this case , the area - weighted energy fluxes become larger seen from the equatorial plane ( see right panel of figure [ f8 ] ) . in combination with the negative values of @xmath31 in equation ( [ tt ] ) in the vicinity of the equatorial belts , this makes the negative growth in the gw amplitudes .",
    "large negative amplitudes seen for some other epochs in other model such as model c ( left panel of figure [ f3 ] ) are also from the same reason .",
    "such a feature is genuine outcome of the neutrino emission in the lateral direction , which is able to be captured correctly by the ray - tracing calculation .",
    "it is noted that the appearance of the negative growth has no systematic dependence of the input luminosities .",
    "in fact , as seen from figure [ f3 ] , the negative growth is observed for the intermediate luminosities models ( models b and c ) , but not for the highest ( model a ) and smallest luminosity models ( model d ) ( see also @xmath101 in table 1 ) .",
    "this should reflect the nature of the sasi which grows chaotically and non - locally .",
    "albeit with the negative growth , our results suggest that the positively growing features dominate over the negatively ones for the 2d models ( see @xmath102 in table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "this is due to the axial symmetry , along which the sasi develops preferentially and the resulting anisotropies become larger .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the neutrino gws become more than one - order - of magnitude smaller than the previous estimation ( compare @xmath103 in table [ table1 ] and the one in @xcite ) .",
    "this stems not only from the incursion of the negative contributions but also from the appropriate estimation of the neutrino absorptions made possible by the ray - tracing method .",
    "previously the neutrino luminosity was estimated simply by summing up the local neutrino cooling rates outside the pnss @xcite , which fails to take into account the neutrino absorption correctly ( @xmath54 in equation ( [ transfer ] ) ) .",
    "these two factors make the amplitudes much smaller than the previous estimation . as a result ,",
    "the neutrino gws , albeit dominant over the matter gws in the lower frequencies below @xmath104 hz ( figure [ f13 ] ) , become very difficult to be detected for ground - based detectors whose sensitivity is limited mainly by the seismic noises at such lower frequencies @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the gws from matter motions seem marginally within the detection limits of the currently running detector of the first ligo and the detection seems more feasible for the detectors in the next generation such as lcgt and the advanced ligo for a galactic supernova .",
    "the spectra of the matter gws have double peaks namely near @xmath105 hz and @xmath106 khz . while the latter comes from the rapidly varying local hydrodynamical instabilities with milliseconds timescales , the former",
    "is associated with the longer - term overturns of @xmath1 ms induced by @xmath107 mode of sasi ( see e.g. , figure 5 in @xcite ) .",
    "these gross properties in the gw spectra are common to the other luminosity models .",
    "thus the peak in the spectra near @xmath108hz is found to be a characteristic feature obtained in the 2d models computed here .",
    "we proposed a ray - tracing method to estimate gravitational waves ( gws ) generated by anisotropic neutrino emission in supernova cores . to calculate the waveforms , we derived the gw formulae in a useful form , which are applicable also for 3d computations",
    ". pushed by the studies supporting the slow rotation prior to core - collapse , we considered an idealized situation that the neutrino radiation field from the protoneutron stars ( pnss ) are isotropic .",
    "then we focused on the asphericities outside the protoneutron stars , which are produced by the growth of standing accretion shock instability ( sasi ) .",
    "since the regions outside the pnss are basically thin to neutrinos , we solve the transport equations by making use of the ray - tracing method in a post - processing manner . for simplicity , neutrino absorption and emission by free nucleons , dominant processes outside the pnss ,",
    "were only taken into account , while the neutrino scattering and the velocity - dependent terms in the transport equations were neglected .",
    "based on the two - dimensional models , which mimic sasi - aided neutrino heating explosions , we estimated the neutrino anisotropies by the ray - tracing method and calculated the resulting gws .",
    "our results show that the waveforms from neutrinos exhibit more variety in contrast to the ones previously estimated by ray - by - ray analysis ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the positively growing feature , which was predicted to determine the total wave amplitudes predominantly , the waveforms show large negative growth for some epochs during the growth of sasi . such a feature is a genuine outcome of the neutrino emission in lateral directions , which can be captured correctly by the ray - tracing calculation . reflecting the nature of sasi which grows chaotically with time , little systematic dependence of the input neutrino luminosities on the maximum amplitudes and on the radiated gw energies are found . due to the negative contributions and the neutrino absorptions appropriately taken into account by the ray - tracing method ,",
    "the gws from neutrinos become more than one - order - of magnitude smaller than the previous estimation , making their detections very hard for a galactic source . on the other hand",
    ", we point out that the gravitational - wave spectrum from matter motions have its peak near @xmath0 hz , reflecting the growth of @xmath107 mode of sasi with timescales of @xmath1 ms .",
    "such a feature is found to be generic among 2d models computed here .",
    "it should be noted that the approximations taken in the simulation , such as the excision inside the pns with its fixed inner boundary and the light bulb approach with the isentropic luminosity constant with time , are the very first step to model the dynamics of the neutrino - heating explosion aided by sasi and study the resulting gws .",
    "as already mentioned , the excision of the central regions inside pnss may hinder the efficient gravitational emission of the oscillating neutron star @xcite .",
    "it is recently reported that the waveforms obtained in the 2d ray - by - ray boltzmann simulations @xcite show a negatively growing feature . at first glance",
    ", our results may seem to contradict with theirs .",
    "they explained that the negative growth is due to the enhanced neutrino emission of muon and tau neutrinos near the equator of the pns observed in their simulations . as we mentioned repeatedly",
    ", such feature inside the pnss , can not be captured here in principle . outside the pnss , however , the stronger neutrino emission of @xmath109 and @xmath57 along the polar regions are also seen in their simulations ( see their bottom right panel of figure 11 outside of @xmath110 km , which is the surface of the pns guessed from their figure 1 ) , which we can say , consistent with our results . as illuminated by this study , the elaborate estimation of the neutrino anisotropy is crucial to understand the gravitational radiation in supernova cores .",
    "this naturally needs a full transport simulation coupled to 3d hydrodynamics encompassing the whole iron core , which is beyond the scope of this study and a grand challenge for all the supernova modellers .",
    "in addition , one more major deficit is the axial symmetry assumed in the present 2d simulations . in 3d ,",
    "the pronounced dominance of @xmath111 along the symmetry axis , which is a coordinate singularity in the 2d computations , may become weaker , owing to the additional spatial degree of freedom in the azimuthal direction . in the 3d case",
    ", we expect that the amplitudes become smaller owing to the reduced anisotropy along the symmetry axis @xcite .",
    "thus the amplitudes calculated in this study could be an upper bound , in which the maximal anisotropy generated by sasi could be achieved . with the ray - tracing method and the gw formulae derived here , we are now able to investigate the properties of the cross mode of gws ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we think it important because they are of genuine 3d origin , which in combination of the plus modes , might give us some hints about the explosion asymmetry .",
    "magnetic effects not only on the growth of sasi @xcite , but also on the gw waveforms @xcite should be interesting .",
    "this study is an appetizer before the forthcoming 3d studies to clarify those aspects , which will be presented elsewhere soon .",
