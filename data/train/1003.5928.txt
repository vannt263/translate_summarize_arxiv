    "after an intense period of commissioning and a short period of collisions at 0.9 and 2.36 tev in 2009  @xcite , the continuous operation of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at multi - tev collision energies looms just around the corner . among the first measurements at the lhc will be the inclusive production of single charged particles ( or hadrons ) , i.e. @xmath2 , measured differentially in pseudorapidity ( @xmath3 ) and transverse momentum ( @xmath0 )  @xcite .",
    "while both distributions are the subject of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the former is generally modeled phenomenologically due to the non - perturbative nature of low-@xmath0 bulk production , while the latter , which involves hard processes , is generally described by the perturbative theory of qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "hard production of high transverse momenta particles ( @xmath4 gev / c ) originates from the fragmentation of hard - scattered partons  @xcite .",
    "the fragmentation of hard - scattered partons into hadrons is described by the probability of finding a hadron carrying a specific fraction of the parton momentum , known as the fragmentation function ( ff ) . in hadronic collisions",
    ", a full description also requires knowledge of the distribution of the initial partons within the colliding hadrons , known as the parton distribution function ( pdf ) .",
    "the measurement of the inclusive charged particle @xmath0 spectrum at large transverse momentum , therefore , measures in essence the convolution of three pieces : the hard - parton scattering cross section , the pdfs and the ffs .    especially at lhc energies , where a large fraction of the total cross section is comprised of the underlying qcd dynamics ,",
    "a precise understanding of the qcd background rates is not only important for understanding standard model particle production ( @xmath5 , z , higgs ) , but also for rare processes beyond the standard model  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the inclusive charged particle @xmath0 spectrum in @xmath6 collisions is an important reference for studying high-@xmath0 particle suppression in the dense qcd medium produced in high energy nucleus - nucleus ( aa ) collisions  @xcite . the suppression ( or enhancement ) of high-@xmath0 particles",
    "is typically quantified by the ratio of charged particle @xmath0 spectra in @xmath7 collisions to those in @xmath6 collisions scaled by the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions , known as the nuclear modification factor @xmath8  @xcite . at rhic , the factor of 5 suppression seen in @xmath8",
    "@xcite was an early indication of strong final - state medium effects on particle production .",
    "it is similarly expected to be one of the first measurements performed by the heavy ion programs at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the inclusive charged particle @xmath0 spectra have been measured in @xmath6 and @xmath9 over a wide range of center - of - mass energies from 31 gev to 1.96 tev  @xcite , and recently at 2.36 tev at lhc  @xcite .",
    "while the measurements up to @xmath101.8 tev ( and @xmath102.36 tev ) are limited to @xmath11 gev / c , the latest cdf measurement  @xcite at @xmath101.96 tev , based on an integrated luminosity of 506 @xmath12 , extended the @xmath0 reach up to about 140 gev / c for the first time .",
    "however , the measurement shows that the high-@xmath0 region can not be described by the power - law modeling established in their earlier measurement at @xmath13=1.8 tev  @xcite .",
    "the incompatibility between the new measurement and the power - law modeling grows from 50@xmath14 at @xmath15",
    "gev / c up to a factor of 1000 at @xmath16  gev / c . in order to fit the entire @xmath17 range ,",
    "a more sophisticated parameterization was introduced  @xcite , namely another power law term was added to the previous fit . with the new parameterization , the normalized chi - square ( @xmath18 )",
    "is reduced from 258/182 to 80/223 , albeit with a factor of 5 - 7 discrepancy remaining above @xmath19  gev / c .",
    "the similarity between the spectra observed at both collision energies up to @xmath20  gev / c ( the range measured at 1.8 tev ) suggests that the incompatibility can not be accounted for by the 9@xmath14 increase in center - of - mass energy .",
    "a disagreement of similar magnitude is observed when the measured high-@xmath0 spectra are compared to leading - order ( lo ) and next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) pqcd calculations , as well as a simple extrapolation based on @xmath21 scaling  @xcite .",
    "the validity of the factorization theorem is even questioned in  @xcite , as a response to the huge discrepancy seen at high @xmath17  the regime where their nlo pqcd calculation should be most reliable .",
    "while the cdf paper  @xcite offers no possible physics origin for the exceptionally large measured cross section at high @xmath17 , the sizable incompatibility with not only their former power - law modeling but also ( n)lo pqcd calculations and @xmath21 scaling suggests that further study might be necessary .    at the lhc , the nominal heavy ion collisions ( @xmath22 ) will take place at a center - of - mass energy of 5.5 tev per nucleon pair , corresponding to the nominal @xmath6 collision energy of 14 tev for the same magnetic rigidity .",
    "scaled by the charge - to - mass ratio of the lead ion : 82/208 . ] for the first year , however , as the center - of - mass energy of @xmath6 collisions will be limited to 7 tev  @xcite , the corresponding @xmath22 center - of - mass energy will be limited to 2.76 tev per nucleon pair . since the @xmath8 measurement requires a @xmath6 reference at the same collision energy as @xmath22 , the first - year heavy ion measurements at 2.76 tev will rely on a combination of theory predictions and interpolations between lower energy measurements and those performed at 7 tev .",
    "in this perspective , the cdf measurement is unique in two regards .",
    "first , the center - of - mass energy of 1.96 tev is closest to that planned for the first - year heavy ion run ( except for the measurement at 2.36 tev which is limited in @xmath0 reach ) .",
    "second , the reach to high @xmath0 far exceeds any previous measurements .",
    "thus , understanding the observed discrepancy with the pqcd prediction is crucial .",
    "in contrast to the observed discrepancy in the charged hadron spectra , the cdf inclusive jet spectrum are in fact well described by nlo pqcd calculations  @xcite .",
    "this is of particular interest , as high-@xmath17 charged particles are understood in pqcd to be predominantly   at most  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible for high-@xmath17 hadrons to originate in the absence of a jet in a higher - twist ( ht ) picture .",
    "however , as the production of hadrons in ht is power - law - suppressed in @xmath0 , that contribution should be negligible as well  @xcite . ] the fragmentation products of hard - scattered partons from the collision , i.e. `` jets '' . in fact , nlo pqcd calculations carried out for charged particle spectra differ only from those for jet spectra by the addition of a parameterization of jet fragmentation .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the uncertainties related to different parameterizations of fragmentation functions ( ff ) and parton distribution functions ( pdf ) only amount to 10@xmath14 and 25@xmath14 , respectively . in this case , the only possible explanations for the exceptionally large measured cross section are either that the current modeling of fragmentation is dramatically incorrect ( by a factor of 1000 ! ) , or there is a flaw in the measurement , or there is a breakdown in the qcd factorization theorem as suggested in  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we attempt to reconcile the apparent discrepancy in the cdf inclusive charged particle spectrum by convoluting the cdf inclusive jet spectra measurement with a set of increasingly different fragmentation functions .",
    "we start with the pythia fragmentation functions to see what the cdf jet spectra imply for the charged hadron spectra absent any surprises in the fragmentation .",
    "then , we modify the fragmentation functions arbitrarily within the bounds of energy and momentum conservation to see if the measured hadron spectrum can be recreated . finally , by using the hardest imaginable fragmentation function  each jet fragments into a single charged hadron  we rule out the possibility that unexpectedly hard fragmentation is responsible for the exceptionally large measured cross section .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the technical details of the convolution method .",
    "we then describe the measured inclusive jet spectra and the pythia inclusive jet spectra in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "we argue that the convolution method can effectively reproduce the charged particle spectra within pythia , i.e. by convoluting the pythia jet spectrum with the pythia fragmentation functions .",
    "we then show that the cdf jet spectra convoluted with the same pythia fragmentation functions gives a similar result . in section 5 ,",
    "we compare to the cdf charged hadron spectrum the results of convoluting the cdf jet spectra with an arbitrary set of increasingly unrealistic fragmentation functions .",
    "the final section contains our conclusions and a further discussion on how this convolution method may be used to cross - check charged particle cross sections .",
    "in the qcd factorization scheme of hadron - hadron collisions  @xcite , the invariant cross section for inclusive high-@xmath17 hadron production is given by :    @xmath23    where the parton distribution function @xmath24 describes the number density of constituents @xmath25 within hadron @xmath26 with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath27 ( in the range @xmath28 ) .",
    "the fragmentation function @xmath29 represents the probability that parton @xmath30 hadronizes into @xmath31 carrying a fraction @xmath32 of the parton energy .",
    "@xmath33 is the characteristic energy scale of the hard scattering .",
    "the lo cross section for the hard scattering of partons @xmath25 and @xmath34 at short distance is denoted by @xmath35 .",
    "the summation is over all partons @xmath25 , @xmath34 , @xmath30 , and @xmath36 .",
    "the hadronization of parton @xmath36 is implicit in the summation . a direct calculation of eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] is possible up to a certain order in @xmath37 provided that @xmath24 and @xmath29 are given .",
    "similarly , the related cross section for inclusive jet production ( ) can be given by the same equation , but with the term replaced by , since .",
    "the convolution method is essentially equivalent to evaluating eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] but based on measurements of the inclusive jet cross section and the fragmentation functions , provided that both are measured :    @xmath38    in this case , it is clear that a knowledge of the inclusive jet cross section and the fragmentation functions associated by jet-@xmath17 are enough to reproduce the hadron spectra .",
    "the convolution of the jet cross section weighted in each jet-@xmath17 bin by the associated fragmentation function can be cast into the following simple differential form :    @xmath39    where the summation is over all jet-@xmath17 bins , and the custom - built fragmentation function @xmath40 is defined as :    @xmath41    the quantity @xmath40 is just the transverse momentum differential cross section of charged particles per jet cross section at a certain jet-@xmath17 with finite bin size . the first term in eq .  [ eq2_1 ]",
    "is well known not only from theoretical calculations but also from measurements of the inclusive jet cross section . however , the fragmentation functions are not known from any measurement in the exact form that they are needed ( i.e. eq .  [ eq3 ] ) . in particular",
    ", the convolution requires that @xmath40 be measured in the same bins of jet-@xmath0 as the inclusive jet cross section measurement .",
    "the inclusive jet cross sections have been reported on numerous occasions by the cdf collaboration , showing good agreement with nlo pqcd predictions for different jet algorithms  @xcite and midpoint cone  @xcite algorithms are used . ]",
    "in particular , their latest measurement of the jet cross section  @xcite , which used a mid - point cone algorithm on 1.13 @xmath42 of @xmath9 collision data , agrees over a large range of jet-@xmath17 and rapidity not only with the nlo pqcd prediction within the respective experimental and theoretical uncertainties , but also with the previous cdf measurements using different jet - finding algorithms .",
    "good agreement with nlo pqcd predictions is also seen by the d@xmath43 measurement over a similar jet-@xmath17 range  @xcite . while a direct comparison of the inclusive jet measurements between the two experiments is not possible due to different rapidity binning",
    ", systematic data - theory comparisons for the determination of lo , nlo , and nnlo pqcd pdfs show no significant inconsistency between the measurements  @xcite . in order to test",
    "whether the disagreement  @xcite in the charged particle spectra between cdf and pythia might originate from a difference in the respective jet cross sections , we compare the latest inclusive jet cross section measurement with that from pythia .    to maintain similar statistics over a large range of jet-@xmath17 , several qcd jets samples @xmath0 process ( isub = 95 ) added for @xmath44 to avoid a divergent jet cross section . ] were generated in bins of the hard parton momentum transfer ( @xmath45 = 0 - 15 , 15 - 20 , 20 - 30 gev / c , etc . ) using the d6 t  @xcite tune of pythia 6.41 ( or 6.42 )  @xcite .",
    "the different @xmath45 bins were then combined after properly weighting each sample by its corresponding cross section .",
    "bin was obtained by taking the difference of the minimum bias cross section with the sum of the cross sections for all other @xmath46 bins .",
    "] several different jet finding algorithms , and sis cone were used with a cone radius @xmath47 were used at mc level to test for possible algorithmic dependences of the jet cross section .",
    "the variation was observed to be smaller than the uncertainties in the measurement over the entire jet-@xmath0 range .",
