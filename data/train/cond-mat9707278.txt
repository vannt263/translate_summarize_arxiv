    "magnetic multilayers have been intensively studied for over a decade now @xcite .",
    "the reasons for it , apart from challenging cognitive aspects , are ( already partially realized ) practical applications of superlattices as magneto - resistive sensors , angular velocity meters , recording heads and magnetic memory elements .",
    "the phenomenon most of these applications is based on is the well known giant magneto - resistance ( gmr ) coming from a strong electron - spin dependence of resistivity in magnetic systems . to optimize devices of that sort ,",
    "it is necessary to test the effect of all of the ingredients of the system in question ( including kind of materials they are made from and thicknesses of particular sublayers ) , either directly on gmr or indirectly on the interlayer exchange coupling ( iec ) . obviously , the effect of a spacer on iec was established first @xcite , the next in turn was that due to magnetic sublayers @xcite and finally the cap - layer ( cl ) effect has been studied quite recently @xcite .",
    "before we present our original results let us briefly recall what are the most important facts concerning the cl s  : i )  the iec oscillates as a function of cl thickness with a period determined by extremal @xmath1 spanning vectors of the cl fermi surface , ii )  a bias of the oscillations ( their asymptotic value ) depends on spacer thickness @xcite , iii )  the iec oscillations are strongly suppressed if stationary in - plane spanning vectors of the cl fermi surface do not coincide with their counterparts of the spacer fermi surface@xcite , iv )  the direct- and inverse - photoemission@xcite on various combinations of overlayers deposited on different films shows a periodic distribution of the so - called quantum well states ( qws ) with periods determined by extremal spanning vectors of the overlayer fermi surface .",
    "we shall refer to the latter only indirectly , by exploiting the fact that the qws lead to some spin - polarization of non - magnetic cap - layers .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to emphasize the relevance of magnetic sublayers to iec oscillations as a function of cap - layer ( cl ) thickness . besides",
    ", we shall comment on induced magnetic moments in the non - magnetic sublayers , which may be viewed as a manifestation of the quantum well states @xcite .",
    "our earlier papers @xcite based on the single - band tight - binding model have proved that the model we use gives a reasonable qualitative description of basic physical mechanisms responsible for oscillatory phenomena in magnetic trilayers .",
    "our hamiltonian , described in detail in ref .  , consists of the nearest - neighbor hopping and spin - dependent on - site potential terms .",
    "the systems under consideration now are trilayers capped with an overlayer , of the type @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 stand for the numbers of cap- ( o ) , ferromagnet- ( f ) and spacer- ( s ) monolayers in the perpendicular @xmath6-direction .",
    "hereafter the subscripts and superscripts @xmath7 and @xmath8 will always refer to the cap- and spacer - layers , whereas the spin - dependent parameters referring to ferromagnetic sublayers will be indexed by @xmath9 or @xmath10 . for simplicity ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to a simple cubic structure and regard the lattice constant and the hopping integral as the length- and energy - units , respectively .",
    "the interlayer exchange coupling has been calculated from the difference in thermodynamic potentials exactly as in ref .",
    ", moreover the magnetic moments ( including the induced ones ) , @xmath11 , have been expressed in terms of the eigen - functions @xmath12 of the hamiltonian as @xmath13 , with @xmath14 , where the summation runs over occupied states .",
    "in this section we present some analytic formulae which will be useful for interpretation of rigorous numerical resluts of the next section . as has been shown in ref .  , the iec can be fourier - transformed with respect to @xmath15 and @xmath16",
    ". that procedure can be quite straightforwardly generalized to include cl thickness as well .",
    "the resulting asymptotic ( within the stationary phase approximation ) expression consists of the terms of the form @xmath17 summed over all the in - plane wave vectors for which the exponential is stationary .",
    "the @xmath18 coefficients are defined analogously as in ref .  .",
    "their exact numerical values are not important for qualitative considerations , one notes only that all the amplitudes of oscillations vanish asymptotically with the given sublayer thickness going to infinity@xcite .",
    "there exist , however , some additional restrictions imposed by the asymptotic behavior of the iec . in particular , a direct generalization of the results of ref .   to the present case , with the cap - layer , gives : @xmath19 ( no coupling for @xmath20 ) .",
    "another limit to be taken is @xmath21 , when , in view of the above mentioned asymptotic behavior , all the terms tend to zero except for @xmath22 and @xmath23 . since the oscillations _ vs. _ spacer thickness survive in this limit in contrast to the ones _ vs. _ cl thickness which decay ( see below ) , we conclude that @xmath24 and @xmath25 .    finally , taking into account the above mentioned restrictions and keeping for simplicity only the lowest order harmonics",
    ", we arrive at the following formula  : @xmath26 where the @xmath27-s are the sets of in - plane wave vectors for which the relevant exponentials are stationary . for the case of the cl thickness dependence",
    "this allows us to formulate the following new selection rule , which in its general form ( for @xmath5 and @xmath4 large and fixed and @xmath3 large and varying ) reads  : @xmath28 with nonvanishing @xmath29 and either @xmath30 or @xmath31 ( @xmath32 is the two - dimensional gradient in the @xmath33,@xmath34 space ) .",
    "this means that out of all the stationary vectors of the cap material fs only those which simultaneously satisfy the above mentioned conditions for the in - plane gradients give rise to the oscillations with cl thickness .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) is the main result of the present paper .",
    "this condition becomes even simpler in the particular case of the single  band simple cubic model considered hereafter , when the second part of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) separates and all the individual in - plane gradients must vanish ( c.f .",
    "ref .  ) .",
    "the origin of the new selection rule becomes clear if we qualitatively interpret eq .",
    "( [ eq : j1 ] ) in terms of the quantum interference model@xcite .",
    "the first term corresponds to the states reflected once at each of the spacer - ferromagnet interfaces , the second and third ones to the states penetrating one of the magnetic layers and reflected back at the cap - ferromagnet interface while the last two terms describe states reaching the outer boundary of the cap - layer ( `` vacuum '' ) .",
    "it is quite clear therefore that the @xmath4-dependent phase factor must be also taken into account while performing the stationary phase approximation .",
    "it is evident from formula ( [ eq : j1 ] ) that the bias of oscillations with cl thickness depends not only on the spacer- and magnetic- layer thicknesses but on the on - site @xmath35 potential as well .",
    "the latter observation results from the fact that the @xmath18 coefficients in the second and third terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : j1 ] ) depend on the value of the reflection coefficient at the cap - ferromagnet interface which in turn depends on the cap material electronic structure .",
    "the stationary spanning vectors , for a sublayer characterized by the potential @xmath36 , can be determined in a very simple way , by minimizing with respect to @xmath37 the following fermi surface equation for the s.c .",
    "lattice  : @xmath38\\ , .",
    "\\label{kz1}\\ ] ] hence the in - plane extremal spanning vectors are : @xmath39 for @xmath40 ; @xmath41 @xmath42 for @xmath43 ; @xmath44 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 \\ , , \\label{kz2}\\ ] ] with @xmath47 2 , 0 and -2 , for the corresponding @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "thus , the period of oscillations @xmath0 sublayer ( with the potential @xmath36 ) thickness , is just @xmath48 ( or @xmath49 ) .",
    "we shall now present our exact numerical results ( see ref .   for details of the method ) and show how they can be interpreted in terms of the analytical formulae from the preceding section .",
    "[ fig1 ] . confirms the well - known fact that the iec oscillations _ vs. _ cl thickness have got a period determined by kind of material the cap is made of and get suppressed if there is a mismatch in corresponding in - plane spanning vectors of the cl and the spacer .",
    "the suppression takes place in the cases @xmath50 and @xmath51 where @xmath52 , opposite to @xmath53,@xmath54 .",
    "the dependence of the bias values on @xmath35 is also clearly visible .",
    "the new effect is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , which shows that the suppression may be due to the misfit in the @xmath55 s corresponding to the overlayer and magnetic sublayers , respectively ( curves @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) , whereas in case of the curves @xmath56 and @xmath57 the periodicity is quite pronounced owing to the matching of the above mentioned spanning vectors . it can be also readily seen from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that the phases of oscillations as well as the bias - values depend on the potentials of the ferromagnetic layers ( exchange splitting ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] show that the selection rule works quite well , even when the relevant layer thicknesses are rather small : @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "this confirms our previous observation@xcite that relatively small systems in the z - direction may reveal the asymptotic behavior",
    ". a detailed inspection of curves c and d suggests that the selection rule is slightly more rigorously enforced in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( due to @xmath59 ) than in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( due to @xmath58 ) , but the effect is tiny indeed and hardly visible . incidentally , all the periods of oscillations obtained by the numerical computations and visualized in figs .",
    "[ fig1][fig4 ] can be pretty well reproduced in terms of the asymptotic eqs .",
    "( [ kz1 ] ) and  ( [ kz2 ] ) : e.g. for @xmath60 and @xmath61 and @xmath62 , we get @xmath63 and @xmath64  ml respectively .    another rather obvious but noteworthy effect consists in vanishing of the iec oscillations _ vs. _ cl thickness when magnetic sublayer thickness gets bigger and bigger .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ figa ] , and has not been discussed either , to our knowledge so far , although such a trend could be predicted on the basis of analytical formulae of ref .  .",
    "in fact this finding means that in order to avoid undesirable effects of cap - layers ( which may be of different thickness in an experiment ) on the iec oscillations one should work with thick magnetic sublayers .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the oscillation bias value depends on the magnetic layer thickness , as could be predicted from eq .",
    "[ eq : j1 ] .",
    "finally , in connection with the quantum well states concept@xcite , we have studied the distribution of induced magnetic moments in the cl ( and in the spacer ) .",
    "a typical result is presented in fig .",
    "the induced magnetic moments are measured in dimensionless units ( @xmath65 ) and are of the order of 0.1% with respect to the magnetic layer magnetization . as expected , the period of the induced - moment distribution within the cl is exactly that anticipated for the bulk cl material fs .",
    "the effect of the other sublayers is minor , except that the magnitude of the induced moments is also magnetic - slab dependent .",
    "this might seem , at a first glance , to be in conflict with the iec behavior which shows no oscillations for parameters of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( cf .",
    "[ fig1]c ) .",
    "yet the spin polarization in non - magnetic layers is related to just one system with the fixed sublayer thicknesses and the given alignment of magnetic sublayers , whereas the iec results from the total energy ( thermodynamic potential ) balance between the two possible ferromagnetic layer alignments and has to do with the series of samples with changing cl thicknesses .",
    "this observation implies that the induced - magnetic moments in the non - magnetic cap - layer ( as well as the qws ) give in general the whole set of periods , out of which only those survive , as far as the iec is concerned , which fulfill the selection rules referring to the entire system .",
    "in other words the iec oscillations are the global characteristic of the whole system , whereas the induced spin polarization in the cap - layer is strictly of local nature .",
    "the selection rules completed hereby by the extra condition related with the extremal spanning vectors of the magnetic sublayers , are quite general and apply to real systems , too .",
    "in particular they allow to explain why in case of the cu / co / cu / co multilayer the short period of oscillations with cu cap - layer thickness is absent@xcite in spite of theoretical predictions @xcite and the photoemission results concerning qws @xcite .",
    "in fact the explanation is simple and quite analogous to that of ref .   about iec oscillations as a function of ferromagnetic layer thickness .",
    "out of two in - plane extremal spanning vectors of the cu fermi surface only the `` belly '' one ( at @xmath66 ) coincides with the extrema of the majority and minority sheets of the co fermi surface , giving rise to the long period of oscillations .",
    "the `` neck '' spanning vector has no counterpart in the co fs and this is why there are no short period oscillations .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that in order for the interlayer exchange coupling oscillations _ vs. _ cap - layer thickness to exist , it is necessary , that both the cap - layer- and magnetic - layer- fermi surfaces share the same extremal in - plane spanning vectors .",
    "if this new `` selection rule '' is not fulfilled the period anticipated from the bulk cap - layer material will not occur in the exchange coupling , although it will still be present in the induced moment distribution across the cap layer .",
    "another finding of this paper is that the iec oscillations _ vs. _ cl - thickness vanish if magnetic sublayers thickness tends to infinity .",
