    "the globular cluster ( gc ) systems of most , well - studied large galaxies reveal evidence for two subpopulations in colour ( and by proxy in metallicity ) .",
    "soon after the discovery of two subpopulations , it was shown that they have different spatial distributions with the _ red _ ( metal - rich ) subpopulation being more centrally concentrated than the more extended _ blue _ ( metal - poor ) one ( see brodie & strader 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , the mean colours of both subpopulations correlate with the mass of the host galaxy , although the relation for the blue gcs is shallower than that for the red ones ( forbes et al .",
    "1997 ; larsen et al .",
    "2001 ; peng et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the _ red _ gcs are known to share a similar 1d radial , and 2d spatial , distribution with that of the galaxy starlight in elliptical galaxies ( lee et al .",
    "1998 ; forbes et al . 2004 ; dirsch et al . 2005 ; lee et al . 2008 ; bassino et al .",
    "2008 ; faifer et al .",
    "2011 ; strader et al .",
    "they also show similar kinematics ( norris et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ; lee et al . 2008 ; pota et al .",
    "2012 ) and stellar populations ( forbes & forte 2001 ; norris et al . 2006 ; spitler 2010 ; forbes et al .",
    "2011 ) in many cases ( although some exceptions do exist , e.g. foster et al .",
    "this suggests that the red metal - rich gcs share a common formation history with the stellar component of an elliptical galaxy .",
    "the _ blue _ gcs have been associated with elliptical galaxy halos in the literature but the evidence for this is usually more indirect .",
    "their radial surface density profiles are flatter than those of the starlight and they generally extend beyond the radius that can be accurately measured for the starlight .",
    "forte et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2011 ) have suggested that the ` halo ' component of elliptical galaxy starlight is associated with the blue gc subpopulation .",
    "the halos of large elliptical galaxies also contain diffuse x - ray emitting hot gas .",
    "this gas is generally thought to be in hydrostatic equilibrium , although the inner regions may experience strong cooling via bremsstrahlung and line emission , and heating from agn ( e.g. osullivan et al .",
    "2003 ) .    in a cosmological context , rare over - dense fluctuations in the early universe collapse first .",
    "thus the old stellar populations in a galaxy ( e.g. the halo field stars and blue metal - poor gcs ) are expected to share the same spatial distribution ( moore et al . 2006 ) and have the same origin ( boley et al . 2009 ) .",
    "recent hydro - dynamical simulations have found similar power - law slopes for the _ stellar _ halos of milky way like disk galaxies ( e.g 2.6 to 3.4 ; font et al .",
    "2011 ) but lack the resolution to simulate gcs directly and have not yet produced realistic x - ray surface brightness profiles . in the milky way",
    ", both the halo field stars and the metal - poor gcs do share the same 3d spatial distribution which has a radial power - law slope of @xmath0 3.5 ( helmi 2008 ) .",
    "furthermore , it is now recognised that a significant fraction of the halo field stars come from disrupted gcs ( forbes & bridges 2010 ; martell & grebel 2010 ) .",
    "as both the blue gcs and the diffuse hot gas occupy the same halo gravitational potential they may reveal the same radial distribution . based on blue gc counts from a wide - field imaging study of dirsch et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and the x - ray emission detected by the rosat satellite , forte et al .",
    "( 2005 ) reported a good coincidence between the projected surface density of blue gcs and the x - ray surface brightness profile out to @xmath0110 kpc for the central dominant galaxy in the fornax cluster ngc 1399 . as far as we are aware this is only case in the literature of a direct comparison between the spatial distribution of blue gcs and x - ray emission .",
    "it is therefore important to understand whether ngc 1399 is a special case or whether such similarities in the projected spatial distributions are common .",
    "a hint that the latter is true comes from the work of mclaughlin ( 1999 ) who pointed out the similarity in the _ total _ gc system surface density profile with the combined stellar and hot gas radial profiles for m87 , ngc 1399 and ngc 4472 . in the halo of a galaxy ,",
    "these profiles are dominated by the blue gcs and hot gas respectively .",
    "lee et al .",
    "( 2010 ) studied the large - scale distribution of gc candidates through out the virgo cluster using sloan digital sky survey data .",
    "they concluded that this distribution was qualitatively similar to that of the large - scale x - ray emission ; with the blue gcs more closely resembling the x - ray emission than the red ones .",
    "finally , we note that the global x - ray emission from giant elliptical galaxies correlates better with the velocity dispersion of the blue rather than the red gc subpopulation ( lee et al . 2008 ; pota et al .",
    "2012 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we have collected data from the literature for a small sample of giant elliptical galaxies that have diffuse hot gas halos and radially extended gc systems that can be clearly separated into blue and red subpopulations .",
    "we explore the radial distributions of these baryonic halo tracers and briefly discuss their interpretation .",
    "our sample consists of two central cluster galaxies ( m87 and ngc 1399 ) , six giant ellipticals in groups or clusters and one isolated field galaxy as listed in table 1 .",
    "most are the central brightest galaxies in their host group / cluster ( i.e. bgg / bcg ) .",
    "table 1 includes the type of galaxy , its environment , hot gas temperature , distance , k - band luminosity , stellar velocity dispersion , physical scale of 1 arcmin and the source of the galaxy surface brightness profile .",
    "apart from the field galaxy ngc 720 , all are massive galaxies with m@xmath1 @xmath0 25 ( m@xmath2 @xmath0 22 ) that dominate their group or subgroup within a cluster , i.e. lie at the centre of their local potential well and x - ray emission . in the case of the cd galaxy m87 , it lies at the centre of virgo cluster potential well whereas ngc 4472 is the brightest galaxy in the virgo cluster dominating its own subgroup .",
    "ngc 1407 is the brightest galaxy in the massive eridanus group ( romanowsky et al .",
    "ngc 4365 lies in the w@xmath3 cloud , a group lying some 5 mpc behind the virgo cluster .",
    "ngc 4636 lies in an x - ray distinct subgroup to the south of the main virgo cluster .",
    "ngc 4649 is a giant virgo elliptical galaxy .",
    "ngc 5846 is the brightest galaxy in the ngc 5846 group .",
    "our sample of elliptical galaxies was selected , from the literature , to have extended radial profiles for both gcs and diffuse x - ray emission . in particular , the blue gc density profile was required to extend to at least 8 arcmin ( about 45 kpc at the typical distance of our sample ) .",
    "further details of the selection process and literature data are discussed below .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as mentioned earlier , we have fit the blue gc surface density data with a beta model ( eq .",
    "1 ) . for ngc 4636",
    "we were unable to obtain stable fits to the error - weighted data and so we chose to fit with equal weighting .",
    "the gc data for ngc 4636 show an increased density at large radii .",
    "this is likely an indication of the uncertainty in the background subtraction .",
    "if we fit only the blue gc data interior to 12.5 arcmin we derive the same beta slope within the errors quoted in table 3 . for ngc 4649",
    "the limited radial extent did not allow for a beta model fit for the blue gcs . in this case",
    "we fit a simple power - law fit to the data beyond 4 arcmin which gives an equivalent beta slope of 0.55 @xmath4 0.09 and is quoted in table 3 .",
    "the results of our beta model fitting to the blue gc density profiles are given in table 3 , along with the @xmath5 values from the x - ray surface brightness fits from the literature .",
    "table 3 also gives mean values and the error on the mean .",
    "the x - ray and blue gc beta slopes are consistent within the errors , while the red gcs have higher beta values than the x - ray profiles at the @xmath02@xmath6 level .",
    "figures 4 and 5 also show the _ red _ gc data with the galaxy surface brightness profile from the literature .",
    "the galaxy profiles are from goudfrooij et al .",
    "( 1994 ) for ngc 720 ; spitler et al .",
    "( 2012 ) for ngc 1407 ; blom , spitler & forbes ( 2012 ) for ngc 4365 ; caon et al .",
    "( 1994 ) for ngc 4472 and ngc 4636 and macdonald et al .",
    "( 2011 ) for ngc 4649 .",
    "although the galaxy starlight does not extend as far as the gc data ( particularly for ngc 720 ) , the gcs and the starlight show similar slopes in their outer regions .",
    "given that the blue and red gcs occupy the same gravitational potential but have different density profiles , the jeans equation suggests that they also have different orbital anisotropy properties .",
    "we support previous findings that the _ red _ gc density profiles generally follow the starlight in elliptical galaxies .",
    "most elliptical galaxies in the sample show good coincidence between the outer slope of the _ blue _ gc profile and the x - ray surface brightness .",
    "we note that the measured gc slopes are dependent on the level of background contamination and hence the overall quality of the data which is not captured by the purely poisson errors given in the literature .",
    "the average slopes of the blue gcs and x - ray emission are consistent within the errors , although our sample is small .",
    "in the previous section we showed that the outer slope of the x - ray emission ( with a mean slope of @xmath5 = 0.51 @xmath4 0.03 ) was in good agreement , in most cases , with the blue gcs surface density slope ( mean @xmath7 = 0.54 @xmath4 0.03 ) .",
    "could this similarity between the projected blue gc and x - ray profiles indicate a direct physical connection between the metal - poor gc system and the diffuse hot gas in an elliptical galaxy halo ?",
    "one possibility is that gcs have formed within hot gas that permeates the halos of giant ellipticals .",
    "for example , in the model of fall & rees ( 1985 ) the hot gas acts to compress colder gas clouds . for metal - poor gas",
    "this gives rise to a characteristic mass of @xmath010@xmath8 m@xmath9 which is typical of gcs .",
    "however a problem with this scenario is that metal - poor gcs also form in dwarf galaxies which lack hot gas halos .    more probably , the coincidence in profile shape between blue gcs and x - ray emission from hot gas reflects the fact that for our giant elliptical galaxy sample both halo tracers are in equilibrium within the potential well centred on the host galaxy .",
    "the observed correlations of hot gas x - ray emission and the blue gc velocity dispersion ( lee et al .",
    "2008 ; pota et al .",
    "2012 ) further supports this interpretation",
    ".    if this is the case , then the similar outer slopes seen for the blue gcs and the x - ray emission has an interesting implication for the relative density profiles of the two tracers and their specific energies .",
    "the x - ray emissivity , which projects to give surface brightness , is proportional to the square of the hot gas density , whereas the projected gc surface density scales linearly with the gc density .",
    "so similar outer slopes in projection imply that the hot gas density scales with the gc density to the power of 0.5 .",
    "in other words , the gcs have a steeper 3d radial density distribution than the hot gas .",
    "the radial distribution of a tracer in equilibrium within a gravitational potential well is related to its specific energy , and hence the relative slopes of the gas and gc profiles will depend on the ratios of their specific energies , traditionally denoted @xmath10 in the cluster literature . in our case : + @xmath11 , ( 2 ) + where @xmath12 is the blue gc velocity dispersion , @xmath13 is the hot gas temperature , @xmath14 is the boltzman constant and @xmath15 is the mean particle mass of the hot gas . using @xmath16 amu , this reduces to : + @xmath17 .",
    "( 3 ) + taking x - ray temperatures ( t@xmath18 ) from table 1 and blue velocity dispersions ( @xmath12 ) from table 2 , the resulting @xmath10 values have a mean of 0.52 for our sample . in other words ,",
    "the blue gcs have about half the specific energy of the hot gas .    assuming that the gcs are virialised and follow the jeans equation , and the hot gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium , the value of @xmath10 is related to the gradients in the density and temperature / velocity dispersion of the two tracers by equation 35 from bahcall & lubin ( 1994 ) .",
    "although kinematic studies of gcs are limited , to first order blue gcs reveal flat velocity dispersion profiles ( e.g. lee et al .",
    "2008 ; pota et al .",
    "the orbital anisotropy for blue gcs is not well determined but orbits appear to be close to isotropic on average .",
    "similarly , x - ray temperature profiles , beyond the very inner regions , are close to flat on average ( osullivan et al .",
    "for the case of isotropic gc orbits with flat velocity dispersion gradient and isothermal gas , the equation simplifies such that : + @xmath19 ( 4 ) + where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the density of hot gas and blue gcs respectively .",
    "hence , since we find @xmath10 @xmath0 0.5 , it follows that we would expect the logarithmic slope of the gas density to be one half of that of the blue gcs , and hence the x - ray emissivity ( scaling as density squared ) would indeed have the same slope as the density of blue gcs .    for a beta model ( eq .",
    "1 ) the logarithmic slope at large radii is given by @xmath22 . given the mean beta value for the blue gcs of @xmath23 this corresponds to a projected outer slope of -2.24 .",
    "if the gcs have spherical symmetry then the _ deprojected _",
    "3d slope for the blue gcs will be -3.24 ( in comparison the surface density of blue gcs in the milky way has a 3d slope of 3.5 ; helmi 2008 ) . in comparison ,",
    "the projected x - ray emissivity ( with mean @xmath5=0.51 from table  3 ) has a slope of -2.06 , and hence a 3d slope of -3.06 , so that the average 3d gas density slope is -1.53 , roughly one half that of the blue gcs .",
    "this result is reminiscent of that found by osmond & ponman ( 2004 ) for galaxy groups .",
    "they derived the specific energy of the galaxies and compared it to that for the hot gas in galaxy groups .",
    "the groups had a mean @xmath10 = 0.75 indicating that the galaxies had a lower specific energy than the hot gas within the group .",
    "( we note that galaxy clusters have @xmath10 @xmath0 1 . ) here , we find that the blue gcs have a specific energy ( @xmath24 ) lower than that of galaxies in groups and much lower than the expected value for the group potential",
    ". thus whatever process gives rise to blue gcs in the halos of giant elliptical galaxies must deposit them with a relatively low specific energy .",
    "if blue gcs have been accreted relatively recently then the likely source would be more massive galaxies which , unlike dwarfs , are able to lose specific energy on a gyr timescale through dynamical friction .",
    "however , perhaps more likely is the accretion and disruption of dwarf galaxies at early times when the group / cluster was less massive than today .",
    "for our sample of 9 giant ellipticals we have shown that the 1d radial surface density of _ red _ gcs , beyond the inner regions , is well matched to the stellar surface brightness profile .",
    "thus , combining with literature studies , _ red _ gcs have the following properties : + @xmath25 similar 1d radial distribution to the host galaxy stars + @xmath25 similar 2d spatial distribution to the host galaxy stars + @xmath25 similar stellar populations to the host galaxy stars + @xmath25 correlate with galaxy stellar mass and stellar velocity dispersion + the _ blue _ gcs in the milky way share many properties with the stellar halo . for elliptical galaxies the connection between the _ blue _ gcs and the hot gas halo",
    "was based on the similarity in 1d radial profiles for one galaxy , ngc 1399 ( forte et al .",
    "here we have revisited ngc 1399 and included an additional 8 giant ellipticals , finding that in most cases there is a good coincidence between the outer slopes of the _ blue _ gc surface density and the x - ray surface brightness .",
    "thus we provide evidence for a connection between _ blue _ gcs and the halos of elliptical galaxies that until now was largely conjecture .",
    "this finding means we can use _ blue _ gcs as a halo tracer for lower luminosity ellipticals for which the x - ray emission is undetected .    as the x - ray emission scales with gas density squared and blue gc surface density scales linearly with gc density , the similarity in _ projected _ outer slopes implies that the 3d density distribution of the hot gas scales with the blue gc density to the power of a half .",
    "consistent with this , we calculate that the specific energy of the blue gcs is about one half that of the hot gas .",
