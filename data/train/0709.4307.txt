    "since the launch of the swift spacecraft , precise data from its burst alert telescope ( bat ) and x - ray telescope ( xrt ) have been obtained on the spectral and temporal behaviour of the x - ray emission in @xmath0-ray bursts ( grbs ) and x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) .",
    "these data have already been used to test the most - studied theories of long duration grbs and their afterglows ( ags ) , the _ fireball _ ( fb ) models ( see , e.g. , piran 1999 , 2000 , 2005 ; zhang & mszros  2004 ; mszros  2002 , 2006 , zhang  2007 ; and references therein ) and the _ cannonball _ ( cb ) model [ see , e.g. ,  dar & de rjula  2004 ( hereafter dd2004 ) ; dado , dar & de rjula  2002 , 2003 , 2007a , 20007b ( hereafter ddd2002 , ddd2003 , ddd2007a , ddd2007b ) , and references therein ] .",
    "the general behaviour of the swift x - ray light curves has been described as ` canonical ' ( nousek et al .",
    "2006 ; obrien et al .  2006 ; zhang et al .  2007 ) ,",
    "and is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ f1]a , b , [ f2]a for xrf 060218 , grb 060904a and grb 061121 . when measured early enough , the x - ray emission has peaks that coincide with the @xmath0-ray peaks of the grb .",
    "the prompt emission has a fast decline after the last detectable peak of the grb . in most cases",
    ", the rapid decline ends within a couple of hundreds of seconds .",
    "thereafter , it turns into a much flatter ` plateau ' , typically lasting thousands to tens of thousands of seconds . finally , the x - ray light curve , within a time order of one day , steepens into a power - law decline which lasts until the x - ray ag becomes too dim to be detected",
    ". often , there are also x - ray peaks during the fast - decline phase or even later , not coinciding with a detectable @xmath0-ray activity .",
    "there is a continuous transition of x - ray light curve shapes from the ` canonical ' ones to the ones that are well described by a single - power decay , e.g.  grb 061126 , see fig .",
    "[ f2]b .",
    "neither the general trend , nor the frequently complex structure of the swift x - ray data were correctly predicted by ( or can be easily accommodated within ) the standard fb models ( see , e.g. , piran  1999 , 2000 , 2005 ;  zhang & mszros 2004 , for reviews of the pre - swift standard fb model , and kumar et al .",

    "the situation in the cb model ( dado , dar & de rjula  2004 , hereafter ddd2004 ) is different .",
    "the model offered a good description , based on a specific synchrotron - radiation ( sr ) mechanism , of the ags of all ` classical ' grbs ( ddd2002 , ddd2003 ) of known redshift , and allowed one to extract the relevant parameters of the cbs of grbs and xrfs .",
    "the consequent predictions for the ` prompt ' @xmath0-rays , based on an explicit inverse compton scattering ( ics ) mechanism , were simple and successful ( dd2004 ) .",
    "as shown in ddd2007a , b ( and references therein ) for ` swift - era ' data , the cb model , with no modification , correctly predicts the temporal and spectral behaviour of the prompt and ag phases .    in this paper",
    "we confront the swift s observations with the predictions of the fb and cb models for the spectral evolution during the fast - decline phase of the prompt emission . in the fb model",
    "this phase was interpreted ( e.g. , mszros  2006 ; liang et al .  2006 ; obrien et al .  2006 ; yamazaki et al .",
    "2006 ) as the ` curvature effect ' or ` high - latitude ' emission of colliding shells ( fenimore et al .  1996 ; kumar & panaitescu  2000 ; dermer  2004 ) . relative to photons",
    "centrally emitted on the line of sight to an on - axis observer , photons from off - axis latitudes arrive later and with smaller number density and energy .",
    "the consequent spectral behaviour is entirely different from that observed ( see , e.g. , zhang et al .",
    "2007 ) . in the cb model",
    "the properties of the fast - declining phase are also dominantly ` geometrical ' . a grb",
    "s @xmath0-ray pulses and their sister x - ray flares are made by ics of light in a ` glory reservoir ' bathing the circumburst material ( dd2004 ) .",
    "this light becomes , in a very specific manner , less abundant and more radially - directed with distance from the parent star .",
    "these simple facts result in the correct description of the temporal behaviour and spectral evolution of grbs , before , during , and after the fast - decline phase .    in the cb model",
    "it is possible in principle to fit the spectral energy flux of a grb in a given energy band , as a function of time , and determine the parameters partaking in a complete prediction of the spectrum at any time in the fit interval .",
    "but the public swift spectral data is limited to a ` hardness ratio ' between the counting rates in the 1.5 - 10 kev and 0.3 - 1.5 kev bands ( evans et al .",
    "2007 ) . to convert these rates into a more explicit spectral information",
    "one must correct for instrumental efficiency , subtract the background and correct for x - ray absorption in the host galaxy , in the igm , and in our galaxy .",
    "the unabsorbed spectra as functions of time is not generally available .",
    "however , the unabsorbed spectral energy flux in the x - ray band , parametrized as @xmath1 , is available in the form of the fitted time - dependent power - law spectral index , @xmath2 , for a set of x - ray light curves measured with swift s xrt ( zhang et al .",
    "2007 and _ http://swift.physics.unlv.edu/xrt.html_ ) .",
    "such a parametrization is not a faithful description of an exponentially cutoff power - law , a band function , or the spectrum predicted by the cb model , similar to the band function for typical parameters ( dd2004 ) .",
    "moreover , to extract @xmath2 , the data from different time intervals was coadded , smoothing the time - dependence of the _ effective _ fitted photon index .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the effective indices @xmath3 in @xmath4 , reported in the cited web - page , with the hardness ratios reported in the swift light - curve repository ( evans et al .",
    "2007 ) . the spectral indices @xmath5 and @xmath6 are related by @xmath7 .",
    "we do not have all of the information needed for a decisive comparison between the spectral behaviour during the fast decline phase of the prompt emission .",
    "but the variation with time of the hardness ratio and of the effective spectral index during the fast decline phase are so spectacular and well correlated to the light curves , that an approximate analysis suffices to prove our points .",
    "we demonstrate this for the hardness ratios of five swift grbs with well sampled x - ray light curves during the fast decline phase and for fourteen other grbs with an extracted effective time - dependent spectral index .",
    "in the fb model , grb pulses are produced by synchrotron radiation emitted by a shock - accelerated electrons , following collisions between conical shells ejected by a central engine ( rees & mszros  1994 , see zhang et al .",
    "2007 for detailed discussion ) . consider a spherical shell , arbitrarily thin , that expands with a lorentz factor @xmath8 .",
    "assume that when two shells collide at a radius @xmath9 , all points emit isotropically in their rest frame an arbitrarily short pulse of radiation .",
    "let @xmath10 be the time of arrival of the first photons on the line of sight to the center of the conical shell .",
    "photons emitted from a shell s polar angle @xmath11 arrive at @xmath12 . if the radiation has a power - law spectrum in the shell s rest frame , @xmath13 , the spectral energy flux seen by the observer has the form ( kumar & panaitescu  2000 ) @xmath14 , where @xmath15\\}$ ] .",
    "thus , for @xmath16 , the high latitude emission from a shell collision obeys @xmath17 , with @xmath18 .",
    "note that the spectral behaviour does not change during the temporal power - law decline .",
    "this is in contradiction with the observed rapid spectral softening .    to confront this problem liang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) _ assumed _ that the high - latitude spectral index @xmath5 is time - dependent but the temporal index still satisfies @xmath19 .",
    "although structured jet models ( mszros , rees & wijers  1998 ; zhang & mszros  2002 ; ross , lazzati & rees .",
    "2002 ) may yield a time - varying @xmath5 , there is no reason why it should depend on an angle defined by the position of the observer .",
    "indeed , the relation @xmath20 is badly violated in canonical light curves ( zhang , liang & zhang 2007 ) .",
    "we conclude that the curvature effect in the currently explored fireball models does not agree with the data .",
    "in the cb model ( e.g. , dd2004 and references therein ) , grbs and their ags are produced by jets of highly relativistic cbs of ordinary matter ( shaviv & dar  1995 ; dar  1998 ; dar & plaga  1999 ) .",
    "long - duration grbs originate from cbs ejected in core collapse supernova explosions .",
    "the ` engine ' of short grbs is much less well established , it could be the merger of compact objects , e.g.  neutron stars , and/or mass - accretion episodes on compact objects in close binaries ( e.g. , microquasars ) , or even phase transitions of increasingly compactifying stars ( neutron stars , hyper stars , or quark stars ) .",
    "the pre - grb ejecta of the parent stars create ` windy ' environments of ` circumburst ' material .",
    "the early luminosity of the event ( a core - collapse supernova for long grbs ) permeates this semitransparent material with a temporary constituency of scattered , non - radially - directed photons : a _ glory _ of visible or uv light , with an approximately ` thin - bremsstrahlung ' spectrum ( dd2004 ) .",
    "the @xmath0-rays of a single pulse of a grb are produced as a cb coasts through the glory .",
    "the electrons enclosed in the cb boost the energy of the glory s photons , via inverse compton scattering , to @xmath0-ray energies .",
    "the initial fast expansion of the cbs and the radially - increasing transparency of the windy environment result in the exponential rise of a grb pulse . as a cb proceeds ,",
    "the distribution of the glory s light becomes more radially directed , its density decreases .",
    "consequently , the energy of the observed photons is continuously shifted to lower energies as their number plummets .",
    "these trends were observed in cgro / batse data ( giblin et al .",
    "2002 ; connaughton  2002 ; ryde & svensson  2002 , dd2004 ) . during a grb pulse",
    "the spectrum softens and the peak energy decays with time as a power law .",
    "this is also the behaviour of the x - ray flares of a grb , which are either the low - energy tails of @xmath0-ray pulses , or fainter and softer signals with the same origin ( ddd2007a ) .",
    "typically , the fast decline of the prompt emission in the @xmath0-ray and x - ray bands is taken over , within few minutes of observer s time , by the ` afterglow ' synchrotron emission from swept - in ism electrons spiraling in the cb s enclosed magnetic field .",

( 2007 ) , for instance , confronting the failure of the high - latitude emission of the fb model to explain the rapid softening of the tail of the prompt emission in sixteen ` clean - tail ' bright grbs , proposed an empirical parametrization of the x - ray light curve during this phase . its spectral evolution can be rewritten as a time - dependent exponentially cutoff power - law : @xmath111^{1-\\alpha_g}\\ ,   e^{-e / e_c(t)},\\;\\;\\;\\ ; e_c(t)=e_c(t_i)\\,\\left({t - t_i\\over t_i}\\right)^{-k}\\ , .",

    "( [ epi],[hrapprox ] ) .",
    "these limiting behaviours may be interpolated by the empirical parametrization of zhang et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , in their chosen narrow range of @xmath77 , with a constant @xmath119 ( they find @xmath120 ) . these authors also discern grbs without a rapid spectral softening during the fast decline .",
    "these seem to us to be cases whose spectral evolution is poorly measured , or cases , like grbs 061126 and 061007 , whose ` fast decline phase ' is not the end of the prompt emission but the late decline of a canonical ag whose plateau phase ended before the beginning of the xrt observations ( dd20007b ) .",
    "the spectrum of the @xmath0-ray peaks and x - ray flares of a grb or an xrf is predicted in the cb model : it is the spectrum of the ` glory s light ' , compton - boosted by the electrons in a cb ( dd2004 ) . the time evolution of the spectrum traces the voyage of the cb through this ` target ' light . though the model predicts the spectrum and its evolution at all frequencies and times , we have focused on the very rapid decline of the flux at the end of a pulse , and the equally swift spectral softening .",
    "their understanding is simple : the glory s ` target ' light is light scattered by the circum - burst matter , and its spectrum is exponentially cutoff . its number density , and the flux of a pulse , decrease roughly as @xmath121 .",
    "simultaneously , the target light is becoming more radial , so that the characteristic energy of the up - scattered radiation also decreases as @xmath122 . these simple facts , explicitly reflected in the predicted ` master formula ' , eqs .  ( [ epi],[grbxlc ] ) ,",
    "result in an excellent description of the observations .",
    "lacking access to detailed spectral analyses , we have used swift data on hardness ratios , uncorrected for x - ray absorption ( evans et al .",
    "2007 ) , as well as the effective spectral index of the unabsorbed spectrum reported in _",
    "http://swift.physics.unlv.edu / xrt.html_. we have demonstrated that the spectral time dependences snugly trace their expected correlation to the corresponding flux variations .",
    "this test of the cb model validates it once again . yet ,",
    "carefully time - resolved absorption corrections would allow even more conclusive tests .",
    "time - resolved corrections are important because , in the cb model , the line of sight to the hyperluminal cbs changes significantly during the long afterglow phase ( e.g. , dd2004 ) sweeping different regions of the host galaxy and the igm .",
    "the changing absorption may induce flickering of the observed x - ray light curve and x - ray spectrum .",
    "in fact , the scintillation - like behaviour in many x - ray light curves and spectra ( see figs .  [ f1],[f2],[f3 ] ) , if not instrumental , may be due to the motion of the cbs in the host galaxy .",
    "this motion may also explain ( dado , dar & de rjula , in preparation ) the reported time - dependence of the equivalent widths of intergalactic absorption systems detected in the afterglow of grb 060206 ( hao et al .",
    "2007 , but see also thone et al .  2007 ) .",
    "at least for grbs or xrfs with a ` canonical ' light curve , the transition in time from a rapidly falling x - ray decline to a much less steep plateau accompanied by the simultaneous and even more pronounced change in the spectrum that we have studied reflect one of the most discontinuous transitions seen in astrophysical data . in the cb model",
    "this transition is not attributed to the continued activity of a steadily energizing engine , but to the passage from one to another dominant radiation mechanism : inverse compton scattering versus synchrotron radiation .",
    "the transition is so fast because the late decline of the ics contribution of eqs .",
    "( [ epi ] , [ grbxlc ] ) is exponential in time , a consequence of the exponential cutoff ( in energy ) of the thin - bremsstrahlung spectrum of the up - scattered light ( dd2004 ) .",
