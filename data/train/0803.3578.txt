    "quasicrystals are metallic alloys with long - range order but without translational symmetry .",
    "their surfaces have been studied extensively over the past decade .",
    "it has been found possible to prepare surfaces with a step / terrace morphology , and several experimental and theoretical investigations have led to a consensus that apart from a small degree of relaxation , the surfaces represent bulk terminations @xcite .",
    "these surfaces provide interesting templates for the investigation of epitaxial growth .",
    "such studies have been undertaken on several quasicrystals @xcite , and quasicrystalline single element clusters and monolayers have been found on both icosahedral and decagonal quasicrystal surfaces . on the five - fold surface of icosahedral al - pd - mn ( @xmath3-al - pd - mn ) , which is the substrate of interest in this work , franke and co - workers found using low energy electron diffraction ( leed ) and helium atom scattering ( has ) that sb and bi form ordered quasicrystalline monolayers @xcite .",
    "using stm , si was found to order quasiperiodically at sub - monolayer coverages on @xmath3-al - pd - mn at the centres of truncated pseudo - mackay clusters @xcite .",
    "recently using stm pb was observed to grow in a quasiperiodic monolayer on @xmath3-al - pd - mn where the building blocks are pentagonal clusters of edge length 4.9  @xcite . in that study",
    "the growth was found to proceed via self - assembly of an interconnected network of these pentagons , although the nucleation sites were not discussed .",
    "in addition to the experimental work on the @xmath3-al - pd - mn / bi system described above @xcite , there have been _ ab initio _ dft calculations of adsorption site energetics @xcite .",
    "krajc and hafner studied the adsorption of bi on the 2/1 approximant to the @xmath3-al - pd - mn quasicrystal @xcite .",
    "this approximant is a periodic crystal whose unit cell contains 544 atoms and whose local structure is similar to that of the quasicrystal itself .",
    "a penrose p1 tiling of edge - length 7.76  was overlaid on the surface of the model as a guide to interpreting the model structure .",
    "this tiling consists of pentagons , rhombs , stars and boats @xcite ( see fig . [ 3 - 2composite](a ) ) .",
    "the binding energies for bi atoms on specific adsorption sites on the surface were calculated and then used for the initial positions of bi atoms to investigate the stability of a full bi monolayer .",
    "the most favourable adsorption sites , in order of decreasing binding energy , were found to be at the centres of surface vacancies ( which are contained within a subset of one orientation of the penrose tiles ) ; atop mn atoms , ( again in the centres of a subset of the pentagonal tiles ) ; the vertices of the p1 tiling and the mid - edge positions of the tiling .",
    "the number of surface vacancies and of mn atoms was considered to be too small for the formation of a quasiperiodic framework , and therefore it was proposed that the vertices and mid - edge positions of the tiling form the skeleton of a possible stable quasiperiodic monolayer .",
    "additional atoms form smaller pentagons inside both orientations of pentagonal tiles . by allowing relaxation of the atomic forces the stability of the proposed monolayer structure",
    "was tested and predicted to have ` pseudodecagonal symmetry ' .",
    "given the prior experimental and theoretical work on this system , we have therefore investigated the initial growth of bi on this five - fold surface using scanning tunnelling microscopy .",
    "the goals of this work were to test the predictions of the dft calculations for the adsorption sites , and to gain insight on the growth mechanism for quasicrystalline monolayers .",
    "the experiments were carried out in an omicron variable temperature stm ultra high vacuum chamber .",

    "the _ i_-al@xmath0pd@xmath1mn@xmath2 quasicrystal sample , produced by the ames group using the bridgman method , was polished successively with 6 @xmath6 m , 1 @xmath6 m and 1/4 @xmath6 m diamond paste before introduction to vacuum and thereafter was prepared in cycles consisting of 45 minutes sputtering with 3 kev ar@xmath7 ions followed by at least 4 hours annealing to 950 k , using electron - beam heating , up to a total annealing time of 20 hours .",
    "bismuth was evaporated from a mo crucible using an omicron efm-3 electron - beam evaporator with a flux monitor reading of 120 na giving a deposition rate of approximately 1.8 ml per hour .",
    "the chamber pressure did not exceed 2.5@xmath410@xmath5 mbar during evaporation .",

    "the underlying surface structure is still very well resolved at this coverage , and this is the basis for the further analysis described in section [ analysis ] . a fast fourier transform ( fft ) of an image of dimensions 1500  @xmath4 1500  was taken at this coverage ( not shown ) . due to the large scale of the image ,",
    "the clean surface structure was no longer resolved ; nevertheless an excellent degree of quasiperiodic order was observed in the fft indicating that the pentagonal bi clusters are positioned on sites which themselves are quasiperiodically arranged .",

    "the saturation island density is usually reached at coverages of about half a monolayer @xcite , and this is the case in the present system : although bi clusters are still visible , fig . [",

    "the fft from this image still shows quasiperiodic order but the spots are more diffuse than for the lower coverages . at a coverage of",
    "1 ml quasiperiodic order is no longer detectable using stm ; we attribute this to the roughness of the film rather than the absence of order .",
    "the monolayer film was found to be well - ordered using helium atom scattering ( has ) @xcite , although the deposition conditions were slightly different in that study .",
    "given the has observation of a quasiperiodic monolayer @xcite , and the fft analyses referred to above , the bi adatoms must nucleate at sites which are quasiperiodically related .",
    "there must also be a high density of such sites on the surface - otherwise quasiperiodic ordering at low coverages will not translate to quasiperiodic monolayer growth as was the case with al - pd - mn / si @xcite and al - pd - mn / c@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "when all such sites are occupied , the remaining gaps in the overlayer can be filled with individual bi atoms , at less energetically favourable sites , leading to the completion of the quasiperiodic monolayer . in the following section",

    "there are several possible reasons for this discrepancy .",
    "firstly , the dft calculations assumed single bi atoms at the above adsorption sites .",
    "this neglects any interatomic interactions between bi atoms which might stabilise them in pentagonal clusters .",
    "secondly the calculations were performed at zero temperature .",
    "thus the atoms are static and possible small reconstruction effects within the p1 tiles which might optimize the adsorption site symmetry are not considered .",

    "however such calculations on the 3/2 or 5/3 approximant models may not be feasible due to the large number of atoms involved .",
    "the observation of bi pentagons with a single orientation , even at higher coverages , indicates that the film should have predominantly five - fold symmetry .",
    "this is in agreement with the leed observations of franke et al . for the monolayer coverage @xcite , and with scans of the he diffraction intensity along high symmetry directions presented in the same paper .",
    "we note also that again this is in contrast to the predictions of the dft results , where the proposed quasiperiodic overlayer was found to have ` pseudodecagonal ' symmetry @xcite .",
    "the analysis rests on the interpretation of the stm data in comparison to the model calculations and simulations carried out by krajc and hafner @xcite .",
    "although they used a surface termination which provides an atomic density and composition consistent with other experimental work @xcite , they point out that other possible terminations might produce features similar to those simulated in their study .",
    "in particular they note that certain truncations of @xmath11 clusters which have been previously proposed as possible origins of the ` dark star ' features @xcite are not included in the chosen termination . notwithstanding",

    "/ al @xcite and al - pd - mn / c@xmath9 @xcite adsorption was found to take place in the five - fold hollow positions .",
    "as noted above , there are not enough of these sites on the surface to present a critical mass and allow the construction of a quasiperiodic framework .",
    "although si atoms do adsorb in the centres of @xmath10 clusters in ` top ' tiles @xcite , they adsorb not in pentagonal clusters but as individual atoms .",
    "the distance between the centres of neighbouring @xmath10 ` top ' clusters is 12.62  , so that a dispersed network of si results .",
