    "bistable systems that are driven between their two states by a periodically oscillating external force are common , both in nature and technology .",
    "a few examples are hysteresis in ferromagnetic @xcite and ferroelectric @xcite materials driven by oscillating applied fields , electrochemical adsorbate systems driven across a phase transition by an oscillating electrode potential @xcite , and liquid crystals driven through a phase transition by pressure oscillations @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use magnetic language , henceforth referring to the order parameter as the magnetization and the oscillating force as the magnetic field .",
    "when the field oscillates at a sufficiently low frequency , the driven system essentially follows the field , switching between its two states in a symmetry - restoring oscillation ( sro ) with the same period , provided that the amplitude of the external force is larger than a critical value which depends on the temperature and the system s spatial dimension . at high driving frequencies , on the other hand , the system is unable to follow the field and instead settles down to a symmetry - breaking oscillation ( sbo ) around one or the other of its zero - field stable states .    over the last decade",
    "it has become evident that the boundary between the sro and sbo regimes corresponds to a singularity that appears to have all the hallmarks of a genuine second - order phase transition .",
    "it is therefore appropriate to consider the sro and sbo as _ dynamic phases _ of this far - from - equilibrium system .",
    "characteristic features of this nonequilibrium phase transition include a power - law dependence of the amplitude of the sbo on the amount by which the frequency @xmath0 exceeds its field and temperature dependent critical value @xmath1 , as well as critical slowing - down @xcite .",
    "the probability density of the period - averaged magnetization exhibits a one - peak structure for @xmath2 and a two - peak structure for @xmath3 @xcite . in spatially extended bistable systems , such as the two - dimensional kinetic ising model below its critical temperature",
    ", the transition also displays a divergent correlation length and finite - size scaling properties analogous to those familiar from equilibrium phase transitions @xcite .",
    "it has become common to refer to this symmetry - breaking transition as the `` dynamic phase transition '' ( dpt ) .",
    "the dpt was first observed in numerical solutions of a deterministic mean - field equation of motion for a ferromagnet in an oscillating field @xcite , and it has subsequently been seen and studied in numerous monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of kinetic ising systems , as well as in further mean - field studies @xcite .",

    "finite - size scaling analysis of mc data for the dpt in the two - dimensional kinetic ising model at sub - critical temperatures provides strong numerical evidence that this nonequilibrium critical phenomenon belongs to the same universality class as the equilibrium phase transition in the two - dimensional ising model in zero field @xcite .",
    "while this result may seem surprising at first , it is consistent with a symmetry argument by grinstein , jayaprakash , and he @xcite . this argument states that continuous ordering transitions of fully probabilistic cellular automata with ising - like `` up - down '' symmetry ( of which the kinetic ising model in an oscillating field is an example ) should fall in the same universality class as the corresponding ising model in equilibrium .",
    "this implies that such a cellular automaton should possess an underlying coarse - grained effective hamiltonian at sufficiently large length scales , which determines its universality class .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to elucidate the origin of the dpt and to clarify the statistical characteristics of the dynamics near the dpt , subject to thermal noise . to this effect",

    "the above picture is generalized by introducing the position dependent variable @xmath185 , defined by @xmath186 where @xmath187 are certain initial times .",
    "the variable @xmath185 indicates whether the local magnetization @xmath132 is close to @xmath188 or @xmath189 .",

    "the temporally periodic coefficients can therefore be replaced by their average values , which reduces eq .",

    "equation ( [ eq:52 ] ) shows the switching phenomenon .",
    "in this section , we study the structure function in the sro phase ( @xmath125 ) in a one - dimensional system . we define the structure function , @xmath201 for the fourier transform @xmath202 of the period - averaged order parameter , @xmath203 we obtain @xmath204 by numerically solving eq .",

    ", we obtained an effective ginzburg landau hamiltonian for the amplitude of the sbo , which is proportional to the dynamic order parameter which characterizes the dpt .",
    "this effective hamiltonian has the same form as the standard @xmath150 ginzburg landau hamiltonian in _",

    "this result implies that the dpt belongs to the same universality class as the equilibrium ising model in zero external field , in agreement with recent high - precision numerical results from monte carlo simulations @xcite , as well as with a symmetry argument which states that the equilibrium ising universality class should encompass all stochastic cellular automata with ising `` up - down '' symmetry @xcite .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the work presented here is the first in which an effective hamiltonian has been explicitly derived for a far - from equilibrium phase transition , confirming that the transition belongs to the same universality class as the equilibrium ising model in zero field .",
