    "<S> because of the difficulty in getting the analytic formula of relative entropy of entanglement , it becomes troublesome to study the monogamy relations of relative entropy of entanglement for three - qubit pure states . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find that all generalized w states have the monogamous property for relative entropy of entanglement by calculating the relative entropy of entanglement for the reduced states of the generalized w states in three - qubit systems </S>",
    "<S> .    _ keywords _ : relative entropy of entanglement , generalized w states , monogamous property    entanglement has played a significant role in the field of quantum information and quantum computation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this attracts an increasing interest in the study of quantification of entanglement for any quantum state . </S>",
    "<S> lots of entanglement measures have been proposed for last two decades , e.g. entanglement of formation ( eof ) , concurrence , distillable entanglement and relative entropy of entanglement ( ree ) . among them , one of the important entanglement measures is the distillable entanglement as it is the optimal rate at which one can extract maximally entangled states out of the given state . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is not a trivial task to give the analytical expression of distillable entanglement for general quantum states . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , the ree has been shown to provide the tight upper bound on distillable entanglement @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the ree can be used as a distance function on the set of density operators . </S>",
    "<S> it is defined as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the set of separable states . although the analytical solutions have been given for the states of some special sets with highly symmetry @xcite , it is still an open fundamental problem @xcite to obtain a closed formula for a two - qubit state due to including the convex optimization problem in terms of ree . </S>",
    "<S> recently , for a given closest separable state ( css ) @xmath2 in two - qubit system , miranowicz and ishizaka have given the ree of all entangled states @xmath3 which have @xmath2 as their css and obtained the analytical solution of ree in some special cases @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , friedland and gour have found that there exists the closed formula of all entangled states for a given css on the boundary of separable states in @xcite . in @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> kim _ et . </S>",
    "<S> al . </S>",
    "<S> _ studied the inverse process and found that it is still an unsolved problem .    on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , multipartite entanglement plays an important role in condensed matter physics . the seminal work of coffman , kundu and wootters ( ckw)@xcite provided a way to quantify the three - party entanglement by introducing the three - tangle . </S>",
    "<S> since then , many researchers began to address the monogamy relations of entanglement @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the monogamy inequality in terms of concurrence in three - qubit systems introduced by ckw : @xmath4 where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is the concurrence between @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , while @xmath10 between system @xmath7 and @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> recently , osborne and verstraete @xcite have generalized the ckw inequality to @xmath12-qubit systems . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the monogamy inequality holds in terms of distillable entanglement @xcite , negativity @xcite and squashed entanglement @xcite , but fails for other definitions such as the concurrence itself and the eof @xcite for a three - qubit state . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that it is of crucial important for the proper choice of the entanglement measure to capture the monogamous nature of quantum entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> now one may ask whether the monogamy inequality holds in terms of ree for a three - qubit pure state . as it is unsolved to find the analytical expression for a two - qubit state in terms of ree @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the monogamy relations of ree for three - qubit states become very troublesome problem .    </S>",
    "<S> it is known that there are two inequivalent classes of genuine tripartite entangled states characterized by means of local operations and classical communication ( locc ) for three - qubit states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one is the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) class @xcite , and the other is the w class @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the feature of ghz - class states is that when any one of the three qubits is traced out , the remaining two are separable . </S>",
    "<S> hence , all ghz - class states are monogamous for any entanglement measure . </S>",
    "<S> the w - class states have the property that their entanglement has the highest degree of endurance against loss of one of the three qubits . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is worth investigating the monogamous property of w - class states . in this paper , we only investigate the monogamy relations of generalized w states @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the reduced states of the states ( [ w ] ) have the following form : @xmath15 where @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the states with the form ( [ partial ] ) are @xmath17-invariant states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recall that the most general two - qubit state which is @xmath17-invariant has the following form @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the most general state which is @xmath21-invariant state has the form : @xmath22 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    at first </S>",
    "<S> , we derive the ree of reduced states of generalized w states in three - qubit systems by use of their symmetric property .    </S>",
    "<S> * theorem*for @xmath3 with the form ( [ partial ] ) , we have @xmath23 & & + \\log   [ ( 1+m)(1+n)]-(b+c)\\log ( b m+2\\sqrt{b c m n}+c n),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 with @xmath25    * proof.*in order to prove the theorem we utilize the fact that @xmath26 when @xmath27 , where @xmath28 denotes a projector projecting an arbitrary state onto the class ( [ partial ] ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a state from ( [ ux2 ] ) is separable iff it has the form : @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 by use of ppt criterion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> because the entangled state @xmath3 is not full rank , @xmath32 must be on the boundary of @xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , either @xmath32 or its partial transposition @xmath33 has at least one zero eigenvalue . </S>",
    "<S> aussume @xmath33 is singular . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalues @xmath34 of @xmath33 show that @xmath33 is rank deficient when @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the css for @xmath3 is the state ( [ separable ] ) with @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> suppose @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , we have @xmath38 . thus @xmath39 & \\geq&a\\log   a+(1-a)\\log ( 1-a)+\\min\\{-a\\log \\la00|\\sigma^*|00\\ra-(b+c)\\log \\la\\psi|\\sigma^*|\\psi\\ra \\nonumber\\\\[2 mm ] & = & a\\log   a+(1-a)\\log ( 1-a)\\nonumber\\\\[2 mm ] & & \\quad + \\min\\{-a\\log   </S>",

    "<S> now we have to minimize the function @xmath42.\\ ] ] it is easy to show that @xmath43 is an increasing function on @xmath44 and have the minimization when @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is found that @xmath46\\ ] ] and @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath48 the minimization problem of @xmath49 has been translated into solving the minimum value of @xmath50 ^ 2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the explicit calculation of the minimization of @xmath49 is now a tedious but straightforward exercise , whose result is quoted in the right side of the eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e1 ] ) . therefore the lower limit of @xmath49 can be reached . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , if @xmath32 is singular , one can obtain the same result by use of a similar analysis , which proves the eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath51    </S>",
    "<S> * example*set @xmath52 when @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> the state ( [ partial ] ) becomes the most general example of vedral - plenio states @xmath54 where @xmath55 by a calculation , it is found that @xmath56 and the known result @xmath57 derived in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> * remark*it is easy to show that the ree of the states ( [ ux2 ] ) and ( [ uxy2 ] ) are the same because they are local unitary equivalent . thus one can obtain the corresponding ree of @xmath58-invariant states @xmath59    in the following we discuss the monogamy relations of the ree for the generalized w states ( [ w ] ) . clearly , the reduced density matrices of a generalized w state ( [ w ] ) can be written as : @xmath60 and @xmath61 for convenience , let @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 represent the ree of @xmath65 , @xmath66 and a bipartite state of ( [ w ] ) on subsystems @xmath7 and @xmath11 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , denote @xmath67 where @xmath68 in order to study the monogamy relations of generalized w states by ree , we consider the image of @xmath69 presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figure ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the fig.1 shows that all generalized w states in three - qubit systems satisfy the monogamy relations of ree . </S>",
    "<S> thus the entanglement @xmath7-@xmath11 , measured by ree , is not completely determined by its partial entanglements , @xmath7-@xmath8 and @xmath7-@xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> it shows the fact that the entanglement of these states is very robust against particle loss @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the monogamy property of the quantum correlations in three qubit pure states is considered . </S>",
    "<S> prabhu _ </S>",
    "<S> et.al . </S>",
    "<S> _ considered the monogamy property of quantum correlations by use of the quantum discord in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that generalized w states do not follow monogamy relation in terms of quantum discord . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , monogamy of quantum correlations for generalized w states using rajagopal - rendell quantum deficit is also addressed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is showed that generalized w states exhibit both mono and polygamous nature unlike that of the w state . </S>",
    "<S> it is different from the monogamy property for generalized w states in terms of ree .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that all generalized w states have the monogamous property in terms of ree . </S>",
    "<S> the result could shed new lights on the study of genuine multipartite entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we have obtained the analytic formula for the reduced states of generalized w states by their symmetric property . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , these states are rank-2 two - qubit @xmath17-invariant states . </S>",
    "<S> the investigation of monogamous property of generalized w states is an application of expressions of their ree . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that there are six different classes for three - qubit pure states under locc with nonzero probability . </S>",
    "<S> although it is still not known if the monogamy relations in terms of ree hold for all three - qubit states , they are true for all generalized w states and other five classes except w - class . </S>",
    "<S> after all , as it is shown that a closed formula of ree for two qubits can be given only in some special cases in @xcite , it is difficult to examine the monogamous property of all three - qubit states .    </S>",
