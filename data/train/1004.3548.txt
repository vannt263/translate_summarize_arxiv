    "small - scale values obtained from the dark matter particles and small - mass halos are suppressed by the random peculiar velocities , while those from the lrgs and massive halos go up on such scales as a result of the finite size of halos , as described in section [ sec : statistics ] .",
    "one can see that , for the most massive halos ( @xmath93 ) and lrgs , the ratio @xmath78 reconstructs the @xmath4 values predicted by linear theory at @xmath8 .",
    "this means that linear theory is accurate enough to predict and constrain @xmath4 using such massive halos . on the other hand , the smaller halos we focus on , the more prominent scale dependence of @xmath4 we find even on large scales",

    "they used mock galaxies assigned to the halos by the hod parameters applied to the sdss main galaxies @xcite which preferentially reside in halos with small mass .",

    "a similar behavior has also been found for dark matter by @xcite up to @xmath97 ( see also the red line in figure 4b ) , but the tendency is much more significant for dark matter halos , even for those with @xmath98 .",
    "constraints on @xmath4 are usually given under the assumption of one constant parameter over a scale range for which the @xmath70 statistics is computed .",
    "however , according to figure [ fig : beta ] ( b ) , it could be a coincidence that one gets the true value of @xmath4 as a best fit parameter .",
    "thus one should be cautious when the deviation from general relativity is investigated through the measurement of @xmath4 from the ratio @xmath99 .    in measuring @xmath4 from the quadrupole - to - monopole ratio in fourier space @xmath100",

    "this quantity can be directly measured in observation .",
    "we put artificial large - scale cuts in @xmath4 values measured from the l600 samples because they have limited number of modes and thus are strongly affected by the cosmic variance .",
    "we can see this by the difference between the green and gray lines because they have similar halo mass . on the other hand",
    ", we did not use such strong scale cuts in figure [ fig : beta ] ( a ) because the effect of the cosmic variance can be eliminated to some extent by taking the ratio of two power spectra @xcite . in fourier space ,",

    "these complex results are somewhat expected because the halo peculiar velocities change very mildly with their mass @xcite .",
    "thus the difference of the scale dependences of @xmath4 among small and large halos can not be simultaneously explained with such analytical models for the pvd .",

    "this indicates that more massive halos have the smaller nonlinearity and stochasticity , and the latter was also found by @xcite using a complementary statistics in real space .",

    "thus both the nonlinearity and stochasticity of the halo biasing , particularly the latter , is likely one of the cause for the systematic deviation of @xmath4 values from the theoretical prediction .      because we also calculated the power spectra and correlation functions for dark matter particles in the same samples as those for dark matter halos and lrgs",
    ", we can directly reconstruct the growth rate through @xmath141^{1/2}\\beta(r ) , \\\\",
    "f(k)=b(k)\\beta(k)&=&\\left [ \\frac{p^{(r)}(k)}{{p^{(r)}_m(k ) } } \\right]^{1/2}\\beta(k).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the difference between the use of @xmath4 and @xmath0 is just whether the bias @xmath3 is used as prediction or measurement .",
    "when @xmath0 is used , however , we can take into account the slight scale dependence of the bias seen in figure [ fig : bias ] .",
    "figures [ fig : f ] show the growth rate measured from the four methods described above .",
    "the horizontal line shows the input @xmath16cdm model predicted from general relativity @xmath142 @xcite .",
    "we can also see that the linear redshift distortions for the lrgs reconstruct the true value of @xmath0 well , except for that from @xmath96 .    here",
    "let us discuss which method can be used to obtain the growth factor @xmath0 better .",
    "figure [ fig : f_comp ] shows the comparison among the 4 methods for the measurement of @xmath0 from the lrg clustering .",
    "as we have seen above , we find strong scale dependence of the growth factor obtained from @xmath96 .",
    "on the other hand , both of the methods in fourier space , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and the estimator @xmath143 in configuration space , can give good estimation of @xmath4 in linear theory on scales @xmath144 or @xmath145 .",
    "we have investigated how accurately the redshift - space distortions can be used to measure the linear growth factor @xmath0 .",
    "the growth factor is a powerful observable targeted by future large redshift surveys to probe dark energy and to distinguish among different gravity theories . for this purpose",
    ", we constructed a large set of @xmath1-body simulations , dividing each dark matter halo catalog into the subsamples with narrow mass ranges .",
    "as an example of a galaxy sample , mock sdss lrg catalogs were constructed by applying the hod modeling to the simulated halos .",
    "then we have measured the two - point statistics , power spectra and correlation functions , for dark matter halos and lrgs .",
    "the dark matter halos were analyzed as a function of halo mass in order to see dependence of the @xmath4 measurement on the halo mass .    we have determined the @xmath4 values as a function of halo mass and scale using four methods .",
    "first , we found that @xmath4 reconstructed from the ratio of the monopole to the real - space power spectra @xmath146 ( equation ( [ eq : pk_mono ] ) ) asymptotically approaches the true value .",
    "in particular for the massive halos and lrgs , the prediction from linear theory known as kaiser s formula is applicable to give a correct constraint on the growth rate . however , for less massive halos , the ratio approaches the true value only at a very large scale @xmath147 .",
    "second , @xmath4 reconstructed from the ratio of the monopole to the real - space correlation function @xmath148 ( equation ( [ eq : xi_mono ] ) ) approaches neither the true value nor a constant even on large scales .",
    "this statement is valid especially for small halos with the bias parameter @xmath149 .",
    "because the growth rate is assumed to be a constant when modified gravity theories are tested , the ratio @xmath150 can not be used in a simple way for this purpose .",
    "third , the quadrupole - to - monopole ratio in fourier space @xmath100 ( equation ( [ eq : pk_quad ] ) ) gives almost the same value of @xmath4 as @xmath78 but with larger error bars as expected .",
    "finally , we found that when the quadrupole - to - monopole ratio in configuration space @xmath105 ( equation ( [ eq : xi_quad ] ) ) is used , a similar conclusion is reached to that of @xmath79 when @xmath151 is adopted .    for small halos with @xmath152 , the reconstructed @xmath4 values do not approach a constant in most of measurable regions , particularly those from @xmath96 in the configuration space .",
    "no method can provide a reliable estimator for the determination of the growth factor from the clustering of such small halos on the large range of scales probed . using the halo catalogs with different box sizes",
    ", we confirmed that such a behavior is not caused by the resolution effect of small dark matter halos . while the scale dependence changes with the halo mass , the peculiar velocity of halos does not change much with the mass @xcite . using the simple dispersion model",
    ", we demonstrated that the different scale dependence of @xmath4 among small and large halos can not be simultaneously explained .",
    "also there are two types of velocity biases which affect the redshift distortion ; the dynamical bias caused by dynamical friction and the spatial bias caused by the difference between the distribution of halos and that of dark matter .",
    "there is no dynamical velocity bias because the halo velocities are determined from the mean velocities of dark matter within the halos in our analysis .",
    "the spatial velocity bias should exist , which is coupled with the nonlinear stochastic bias discussed in the text .",
    "on the other hand , it is known that the clustering of small dark matter halos depends not only on their mass but also on their assembly history , so called the assembly bias ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite showed that old and low - mass halos that are preferentially associated with a high density field are more strongly clustered than young halos with the same mass , and consequently have higher velocities .",
    "besides , the stochasticity between halos and dark matter is @xcite can be a source of the systematic errors in the @xmath4 reconstruction . using a method introduced by @xcite and applied to simulation data by @xcite",
    ", we have found that both the nonlinearity and the stochasticity of small halos become larger than massive halos .",
    "particularly the stochastic bias monotonically increases as the mass of halos decreases , as was found in real space by @xcite using the two - point statistics .",
    "thus the strong scale dependence of @xmath4 for low mass halos could be caused by the assembly and/or nonlinear stochastic bias .",
    "however fortunately , the scale dependence of the measured @xmath4 weakens with the increase of halo mass . for massive halos with @xmath153 ,",
    "the measured @xmath4 approaches the constant predicted by kaiser s formula on scales @xmath154 or @xmath155 .",
    "because the analysis of redshift - space distortions is powerful to investigate not only properties of dark energy but also modified gravity theories , it will keep on playing a key role in ongoing and upcoming large redshift surveys , such as boss , fmos , hetdex , wigglez , and bigboss .",
    "galaxies targeted by the boss survey are luminous red galaxies , which reside in massive halos . in this work",
    "we demonstrate the @xmath4 value can be well reconstructed with a redshift distortion analysis of lrgs . on the other hand , one of the samples targeted by the bigboss , for example ,",
    "is that of emission - line galaxies , which reside in halos with a broad range of halo mass .",
    "one needs to be careful in using such a sample to constrain the growth rate from the redshift distortion , because it can be a scale - dependent function .",
    "while one might be able to obtain a result consistent ( or inconsistent ) with the prediction from general relativity , it could be just a coincidence after the scale - dependent growth rate is averaged over some separation or wavenumber ranges .",
    "we will use semi - analytical modeling or a halo occupation model to investigate this issue in future work .",
    "recently , an interesting method was proposed by @xcite to suppress the shot noise in power spectrum measurement .",
    "they considered an optimal weighting function @xmath156 in measuring the galaxy overdensity , where they give higher weights on higher mass halos . compared with our results presented here",
    ", such a mass weighting scheme is useful not only for suppressing the shot noise but also obtaining the true value of the growth rate .",
    "this scheme can be naturally incorporated into our method and such a study will be presented in our future paper . another theoretical improvement to be applied for observation is evading the cosmic variance limit , which is one of the most important tasks for precise measurement of the redshift - space distortions , as we have already seen above .",
    "@xcite showed using multiple tracers of density with different biases suppresses the noise for measurement of @xmath4 on large scales dramatically compared to the traditional single tracer method ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "but the different scale - dependent properties of @xmath4 for different halo masses found in figure 4 imply that the real situation might be more complex , and realistic models of galaxies must be adopted to investigate if the method of multiple tracers works .",
