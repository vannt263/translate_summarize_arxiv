    "the existence of cosmic rays with energies above the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff  @xcite is one of the most important open problems in high - energy astrophysics  @xcite .",
    "these ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) may be a tantalizing hint of novel and very powerful astrophysical accelerators , or they may be harbingers of new microphysics via the decays of metastable supermassive particles . _",
    "it is remarkable that we still do not know whether the uhecrs originate from macrophysics or microphysics .",
    "_ if there is no gzk cutoff , as suggested by the agasa data  @xcite , the sources of the uhecrs would need to be local . in this case , since local magnetic fields are unlikely to have deflected significantly their directions of propagation , the uhecrs would ` remember ' the directions of their sources .",
    "thus , one would expect some anisotropy in the arrival directions of the uhecrs , associated either with discrete energetic astrophysical sources nearby , such as bl lac objects  @xcite , or the distribution of ( mainly galactic ) superheavy dark matter .",
    "no significant anisotropy of the uhecrs has yet been seen , but the existing experiments have insufficient statistics to exclude one at the expected level  @xcite . on the other hand , the gzk cutoff may be present in the hires data  @xcite , in which case no exotic microphysics may be needed , and any astrophysical sources would be less restricted and more difficult to trace . the first batch of auger  @xcite data are inconclusive on the possible existence of the gzk cutoff .",
    "superheavy particles of the type required could have been produced gravitationally around the end of inflation  @xcite .",
    "particularly interesting candidates for such superheavy particles are cryptons , bound states of the fractionally - charged constituents that arise generically  @xcite in the hidden sectors of models of particle physics derived from the heterotic string  .",
    "cryptons arising in the hidden sector of a heterotic string - derived flipped su(5 ) model may have exactly the right properties to play this role  @xcite .",
    "these flipped cryptons  are bound by su(4 ) hidden - sector interactions , and include four - constituent meta - stable bound states called _ tetrons _ that are analogues of the three - constituent baryons of qcd , as well as two - constituent meson - like states .",
    "indeed , it was within this flipped su(5 ) model that the confinement solution to avoiding the stringent experimental limits placed on fractional charges was first pointed out , and this model remains the only example to have been worked through in any detail  @xcite .    in general , tetrons may decay through @xmath1-order non - renormalizable operators in the superpotential , which would yield lifetimes that are expected to be of the order of @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the tetron mass and @xmath4  gev is the string scale .",
    "the @xmath5-dependent factor reflects the expected dependence of high - order superpotential terms on the effective gauge coupling @xmath6 .",
    "the mass scale associated with these states is estimated using the renormalization group for the su(4 ) interactions to be @xmath7  gev , just in the right range for their decays to produce the uhecrs .",
    "the lifetimes of neutral tetrons without electric charge has been estimated to lie in the range @xmath8  years , so that they may still be present in the universe today , and might produce the necessary flux of uhecrs if they are sufficiently abundant .",
    "we have shown in our previous work  @xcite that the mesons and charged tetrons - whose present - day abundances are subject to very stringent experimental limits - would have decayed with short lifetimes early in the universe . in the course of studying the possible tetron lifetimes ,",
    "we identified various 10@xmath9-order superpotential operators that might govern neutral tetron decays . thus , in this specific model of flipped cryptons we are able to go beyond generic statements regarding the injected uhecr particle spectra that may result from their decays , and make a number of specific predictions .",
    "this enables us to address an important experimental constraint on such crypton models of the uhecrs .",
    "although top - down  models such as crypton decays may appear to be natural explanations for the uhecrs ( if they exist ) , they generically share a potential drawback .",
    "the spectra of uhecrs that they produce might be expected to have large photon fractions , in possible conflict with the observation that most of the uhecr primaries appear to be protons or nuclei .",
    "the auger collaboration has recently set an upper limit of @xmath10 on the photon fraction above @xmath11  ev  @xcite , and the limit may even be as low as 7 - 14%  @xcite ) , while an upper limit of @xmath12 at energies above @xmath13  gev has been set by the agasa collaboration  @xcite .    in this paper , we first give a review of relevant aspects of the flipped su(5 ) heterotic string model .",
    "we then analyze the specific primary multi - body decay modes governed by the various different 10@xmath9-order superpotential operators found in our previous paper .",
    "we then calculate the uhecr particle spectra that would be injected by these decays using one of the most detailed and complete codes currently available  @xcite , paying particular attention to the photon fraction .",
    "the total uhecr spectra obtained from the various superpotential terms do not differ greatly . on the other hand , we find that different decay operators may give rather different photon fractions , particularly at the highest energies . however , in every case , we find that the calculated spectra after supersymmetric evolution and fragmentation are compatible with the published upper limits on the photon fractions in various energy ranges , when we include the uhecr background resulting from a homogenous extragalactic distribution of sources and incorporate the pile - up expected from the gzk effect",
    ". there is no need to appeal to the cosmic radio background to absorb a significant fraction of the photons in order to bring them below the agasa and other limits .",
    "the basic idea in generic top - down  explanations ( see  @xcite ) is that the uhecr are produced via the decay of some relic particles or topological defects left over from the inflationary epoch and which are locally clustered in the galactic halo as cold , dark matter with an over - density @xmath14 .",
    "the lifetime of such relics must exceed the present age of the universe in order for them to exist today in sufficient abundance , however the lifetime must not be too large so that the decay rates produced are too small to produce the uhecr .",
    "furthermore , the relic mass must be at least @xmath15  gev in order to produce the uhecr energies observed .",
    "typically , the lifetime of a particle is expected to be inversely proportional to it s mass , @xmath16 .",
    "clearly it is not easy to have a particle with both a large enough mass and a decay lifetime in the right range to produce the uhecr .",
    "however , as pointed out in the introduction , flipped @xmath17 cryptons satisfy both of these criteria , which makes them very attractive as a top - down explanation of the uhecr .",
    "indeed the flipped  crypton is probably the most natural and most physically motivated of any top - down candidate .",
    "there are three generic statements that can be presently made about a decaying super - heavy @xmath18 particle explanation for the uhecr :    1 .",
    "since the super - heavy relics may accumulate locally in the galactic halo with an over - density @xmath19 over the cosmological average , they may avoid the gzk cutoff .",
    "2 .   due to the displacement of our solar system with respect to the galactic plane",
    ", there should be some anisotropy in the arrival directions of the uhecr with respect to the galactic center .",
    "3 .   photons tend to be the dominant component of the uhecr flux produced by the super - heavy @xmath18 decay . however , the photons may scatter off the galactic radio background , which is poorly measured , and thus may be somewhat attenuated .    the injection spectrum produced by such a decaying super - heavy relic @xmath18-particles with number density @xmath20 and lifetime",
    "@xmath21 is proportional to the inclusive decay width : @xmath22 if a spherical halo of radius @xmath23 and uniform number density @xmath20 is assumed , then the galactic halo contribution to the uhecr will be given by @xmath24 in general , the @xmath18-particles will decay into one or more partons which hadronize into other particles @xmath6 of the mssm , which carry a fraction @xmath25 of the maximum available momentum @xmath26 and a fraction @xmath27 of the parton momentum .",
    "for such a decay , the inclusive decay width can be factored as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the fragmentation function ( ff ) for particles of type @xmath6 into particles of type @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the energy scale , most appropriately taken to be equal to the @xmath18 particle mass , @xmath32 .",
    "the evolution of the fragmentation function is governed by the dglap equations , which may be extended to include the mssm .",
    "thus , the determination of the expected uhecr flux from the super - heavy @xmath18 decay essentially becomes the problem of starting with a set of initial decay partons and evolving the decay cascades via the fragmentation functions to find the end decay products and energy distribution . to evolve the fragmentation functions up to the energy of the super - heavy @xmath18 decay",
    ", the dglap equations must be solved numerically .",
    "several groups have done such calculations for generic initial decay partons ( usually into a quark - antiquark pair )  @xcite .",
    "perhaps the best such code is ` shdecay `  @xcite .",
    "this code calculates the fragmentation into the seven stable mssm particles ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , neutralino lsp @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) for any given initial decay parton . in the case of flipped @xmath17 cryptons",
    ", we have a specific model where the initial decay partons in the cascade are known .",
    "in addition to the uhecr flux produced by the super - heavy decay from @xmath18 particles clustered in our galactic halo , there may be a background flux from sources outside of our galaxy , perhaps super - heavy @xmath18 decay in _ other _ galactic halos or in intergalactic regions .",
    "generally , this flux is assumed to be due to a homogenous distribution of sources and exhibits a characteristic gzk pileup due to the fact that they are produced _ non - locally _  @xcite .",
    "since the gzk attenuation is much more severe for photons than for nucleons , this background should be comprised primarily of nucleons .",
    "thus , in this scenario the uhecr flux observed on earth will be the sum of this extragalactic background and the local galactic flux from decaying relics clustered in our galactic halo . due to the extragalactic component",
    ", super - heavy @xmath18 particle decay may only unambiguously explain the uhecr flux for energies @xmath40  ev . however , we note that the extragalactic component may also be due partially to _ non - local _ super - heavy @xmath18 decay , as well from astrophysical sources ( bottom - up  production ) .",
    "thus , it is more accurate to say that a distinct signal of super - heavy @xmath18 decay within our galactic halo would be the existence of an excess of events above this energy .",
    "the lack of any events above this energy would not rule out the presence of a top - down component , but it would not provide an unambiguous reason for the introduction of such a mechanism .",
    "even before the first string models , there was strong interest in flipped su(5 ) as a possible grand unified theory , primarily because it did not require large higgs representations and avoided the constraints of minimal su(5 )  @xcite without the extra gauge interactions required in larger groups such as so(10 )  @xcite .",
    "interest in flipped su(5 ) increased within the context of string theory , since simple string constructions could not provide the adjoint and larger higgs representations required by other grand unified theories , whereas they could provide the higgs representations required for flipped su(5 ) .",
    "it was , moreover , observed that flipped su(5 ) provided a natural ` missing - partner ' mechanism for splitting the electroweak - doublet and colour - triplet fields in its five - dimensional higgs representations  @xcite .",
    "heterotic string - derived flipped su(5 ) remains among the most fully developed and realistic models yet derived from string .    flipped su(5 )",
    "derives its name from the flipping of the quark and lepton assignments relative to those in the minimal su(5 ) gut  @xcite : @xmath41 and @xmath42 for all three generations .",
    "this requires the gauge group to become su(5 ) @xmath43 u(1 ) , so as to accomodate the charges of the quarks and leptons , which fill up the @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 representations of su(5 ) : @xmath47 the presence of a neutral component in the @xmath45 allows spontaneous gut symmetry breaking to be achieved using a @xmath45 and a @xmath48 of superheavy higgs fields with the same and opposite u(1 ) hypercharges .",
    "their neutral components develop large vacuum expectation values ( _ vev _",
    "s ) breaking su(5 ) @xmath43 u(1 ) @xmath49 su(3 ) @xmath43 su(2 ) @xmath43 u(1 ) , while the electroweak spontaneous breaking occurs through the higgs doublets @xmath50 and @xmath51 : @xmath52 the resulting economical doublet - triplet splitting mechanism gives a large mass to the higgs triplets @xmath53 by coupling them to states in @xmath45 and @xmath48 higgs representations , through trilinear superpotential couplings of the form @xmath54 while keeping light the higgs doublets @xmath55 light .",
    "the absence of any mixing between the higgs triplets @xmath53 in this dynamic doublet - triplet splitting mechanism provides a natural suppression of the @xmath56 operators that might otherwise mediate rapid proton decay , so that flipped su(5 ) is probably the simplest unified model that can satisfy the experimental limits placed on the proton lifetime  @xcite .    string - derived flipped su(5 ) belongs to a class of models constructed using free fermions on the world sheet , corresponding to compactification on the @xmath57 orbifold at the maximally - symmetric point in the narain moduli space  @xcite .",
    "although this model was originally constructed in the weak - coupling limit , it is possible that it may be elevated in the strong - coupling limit to an authentic @xmath58-theory model and may at some point make contact with models based on d - brane constructions .",

    "the total uhecr spectra are consistent with a contribution from cryptons weighing between @xmath131 and @xmath132  gev , although only a crypton mass @xmath133  gev would provide an unambiguous signal over conventional explanations .",

    ", the larger data set expected from auger may be able to discriminate between crypton decays and other models of uhecrs , and also among different crypton models themselves .",
    "greater statistics will enable the uhecr anisotropy to be measured with sufficient accuracy to discriminate crypton decay from a uniform distribution of astrophysical sources , and more accurate measurements of the photon fraction at higher energies might offer some discrimination between models with lepton and quark primaries , as seen by comparing figs .  1 to 6 with figs .",
    "7 and 8 above .",
    "thus there is hope that , in the near future , we may finally learn whether uhecrs have a macrophysical origin or a microphysical origin and , in the latter case , may start to discriminate between different microphysical models .",

    "<S> we calculate the spectra of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) in an explicit top - down model based on the decays of metastable neutral ` crypton ' states in a flipped su(5 ) string model . for each of the eight specific @xmath0-order superpotential operators that might dominate crypton decays , we calculate the spectra of both protons and photons , using a code incorporating supersymmetric evolution of the injected spectra . for all the decay operators , </S>",
    "<S> the total uhecr spectra are compatible with the available data . also , the fractions of photons are compatible with all the published upper limits , but may be detectable in future experiments .    </S>",
