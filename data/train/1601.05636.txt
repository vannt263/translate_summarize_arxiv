    "despite the lack of any immediate physical interpretation , changing the sign of the frequency @xmath1 of a classical wave from a positive to a negative number does not contradict any physical law .",
    "for instance , a plane wave @xmath2 moving with a phase velocity @xmath3 can be written as , @xmath4\\label{classical - wave}\\ ] ] where the frequency @xmath5 is a function of wavevector @xmath6 .",
    "all that happens when @xmath1 is that the wave reverses its direction , @xmath7 . in this respect",
    "the relative sign of @xmath8 and @xmath6 is all that matters , as it encodes the propagation direction of the wave .",
    "typically the convention is that @xmath8 is positive so that the direction is determined by the sign of @xmath6 . yet",
    "one can not ensure that this convention always holds , for there are often situations  usually involving a change of reference frame  where waves appear to reverse their direction through a change in sign of the frequency rather than wave  vector .",
    "such situations are not trivial , and they are associated with some interesting physical effects : cherenkov radiation is emitted in a cone consisting of waves with positive frequency in the laboratory frame , but negative frequency in the rest frame of the particle  @xcite ; the `` quantum friction '' that has been a subject of recent debate and is predicted to occur between relatively moving dielectrics at zero temperature  @xcite has similar origin to the cherenkov effect  @xcite , and stems from the mixing of positive and negative frequency waves in the two materials  @xcite ; and hawking radiation  @xcite and its laboratory analogues  @xcite originate from the change in the sign of the frequency of a wave as it crosses the event horizon , an effect that has been recently experimentally observed in a number of analogue systems  @xcite , and led to the identification of new pulse propagation phenomena within fibre optics  @xcite . in this paper we use a very simple model to clarify the physical meaning of a frequency that changes sign between reference frames . we do this through considering the effect that such modes have on a moving oscillator . the internal degree of freedom of the oscillator is imagined as a probe of the local density of states , and as a model for any system coupled to a moving medium , e.g. an atom above a moving surface  @xcite .    before introducing the model we consider an example to illustrate when we should expect frequencies to change sign between reference frames .",
    "imagine two cases where an observer travels relative to an electromagnetic wave : ( i ) moving through free space at velocity @xmath9 relative to a light wave with a wavevector at angle @xmath10 , @xmath11 $ ] ; and ( ii ) moving through a medium at the same velocity but parallel to a light wave @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the refractive index of the medium . in both cases",
    "the moving observer sees a wave with wave  vector and frequency that have undergone a lorentz transformation  @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 . in both cases ( i ) and ( ii ) the observer can travel fast enough for the wave to appear to reverse its direction of propagation . in case ( i )",
    "this occurs when @xmath16 , which is where @xmath17 takes a different sign in the frame of the moving observer , with @xmath18 remaining positive . yet in case ( ii ) the wave appears to reverse direction when @xmath19 where the transformed wavevector @xmath17 remains positive , but the frequency @xmath18 changes sign . consequently , even though we conventionally take all frequencies positive in one frame of reference , changing reference frame can cause some of these frequencies to change sign . applying the formula @xmath20 , one is led to the conclusion that positive energy quanta in the rest frame appear as negative energy quanta in the moving frame .",
    "such negative energy quanta imply a kind of instability where waves can be excited by a moving particle , while lowering the energy of the system .",
    "such waves were recognised during the early work on quantum electrodynamics by authors such as jauch and watson  @xcite , but still remain somewhat mysterious . a recent more detailed analysis that includes",
    "the dispersion and dissipation of the medium  @xcite shows that these modes cause the hamiltonian of the field to lack a lower bound , and are the origin of the force of quantum friction  @xcite . from this example",
    "it is clear that the change in the sign of the frequency has its origin in the inclusion of a macroscopic description of a dielectric medium through the refractive index @xmath21 ( the effect disappearing when @xmath22 ) . in this work",
    "we use a simple microscopic model of a dielectric medium  similar to that described in  @xcite  to understand the microscopic meaning of frequencies that change their sign between reference frames , and the origin of the negative energy quanta that arise when @xmath19 .",
    "in the spirit of taking simplest cases first , we consider a one  dimensional model for a dielectric medium . for a fixed frequency @xmath8",

    "as one would expect , the scatterers impede the propagation of power through the lattice .",
    "the velocity at which this energy flows through the lattice can also be calculated in this model .",
    "the power flow obeys a continuity equation , @xmath55 where the time averaged energy density @xmath56 is given by @xmath57\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\varphi}{\\partial t}\\right)^{2}\\right\\rangle\\label{energy - density}\\ ] ] which in the limit of a monochromatic field becomes @xmath58\\varphi\\varphi^{\\star}\\right\\}\\label{energy - density - mono}\\ ] ] for a frequency dependent @xmath25 the limiting form of @xmath56 given in ( [ energy - density - mono ] ) would be given by the brillouin energy density  @xcite .",

    "the equality of the energy flow velocity with the group velocity can be found after an application of the dispersion relation ( [ eq : blochvector ] ) .",
    "notice that the final term in the denominator comes from integrating over the delta functions in the energy density ( [ energy - density ] ) and reduces the velocity at which energy can move through the lattice .",

    "as @xmath206 is increased , the effect of the lattice becomes more prominent and the velocity above which there is a non - zero absorption decreases .",

    "we considered an example to illustrate the effect of frequencies that change sign between inertial reference frames : a @xmath207d scalar field coupled to a simple harmonic oscillator that moves through a medium ( refractive index @xmath21 ) at velocity @xmath86 .",
    "when the oscillator moves slower than @xmath91 the coupling to the scalar field has a damping effect on the oscillatory motion , while when @xmath19 we found this damping is reduced to zero .",
    "the reason for the suppression of this damping can be understood as being due to modes that have doppler shifted from a positive frequency in the rest frame of the medium , to a negative frequency in the rest frame of the oscillator .    to better understand the physical significance of these modes we developed a simple model similar to that presented by griffiths and taussig  @xcite , where the medium is replaced by a lattice of scatterers that in the long wavelength limit behave collectively as a refractive index @xmath21 . when considered in this way",
    ", we see that the moving lattice causes a periodic forcing of the oscillator . for velocities much below @xmath96 ,",
    "this periodic forcing always takes energy from the oscillatory motion . meanwhile for velocities above @xmath91 the forcing has equal contributions that are both in phase and out of phase with the oscillatory motion , corresponding to the reduced damping rate observed in the long wavelength limit .",
    "furthermore we found that by including the various diffracted components of the field the damping smoothly reduces as the velocity is increased , whereas in the limit where the medium is described in terms of a refractive index @xmath21 the damping abruptly reduces above @xmath96 .",
    "our findings provide a more complete understanding of the ` negative frequency ' modes that have recently received attention in the context of quantum friction  @xcite and the analogue hawking effect  @xcite , and we can now understand them as encoding an approximation to the forcing effect of the motion of the scatterers past the observer ( see figure  [ work_figure ] ) . furthermore  to the best of the authors knowledge  our simple model of an oscillator coupled to a wave in a moving medium is new and may be experimentally accessible . after all",
