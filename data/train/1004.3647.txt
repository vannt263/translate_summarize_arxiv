    "the investigation of rare @xmath6 decays induced by the flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) transitions @xmath7 and @xmath8 represents an important test of the standard model ( sm ) and its extensions ( see @xcite for a review ) . among the rare decays , the radiative decay @xmath9 has probably been the most popular fcnc transition ever since its experimental observation as @xmath10 at cleo in 1993 @xcite .",
    "this decay proceeds through a loop ( penguin ) diagram , to which high - mass particles introduced in extensions to the sm may contribute with a sizable amplitude .",
    "the size of the decay rate itself , however , provides only a mild constraint on such extensions , because the sm predictions for exclusive rates suffer from large and model - dependent form factor uncertainties @xcite .",
    "further reduction in the errors of the theory appears rather difficult .",
    "it is then clearly advantageous to use , in addition to the rates , other observables that can reveal new physics ( np ) .    in particular , in the framework of the sm ,",
    "the photons emitted in @xmath9 decays are predominantly left - handed , while those emitted in @xmath11 decays are predominantly right - handed .",
    "based on the leading order effective hamiltonian , the amplitude for emission of wrong - helicity photons is suppressed by a factor @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this suppression can easily be alleviated in a large number of np scenarios where the helicity flip occurs on an internal line .",
    "an independent measurement of the photon helicity is therefore of interest .",
    "several different methods of measuring the photon polarization have been suggested . in one method",
    "the photon helicity is probed through mixing - induced cp asymmetries @xcite .",
    "another method makes use of the photons from the @xmath13 decay , which are converted into the electron - positron pair in the detector material @xcite .",
    "there are also other techniques to probe photon polarization .",
    "these include approaches in which interference between different resonances @xcite or different helicity states @xcite of the hadronic recoil system provide sensitivity to the polarization .",
    "the photon polarization may also be studied in radiative decays of @xmath14 baryons @xcite .",
    "it appears , however , that experimentally the photon polarization is difficult to measure , and one instead has to use the process @xmath15 , where the photon is converted to the lepton pair . in this decay the angular distributions and lepton polarizations",
    "can probe the chiral structure of the matrix element @xcite and thereby the np effects .    in order to unambiguously measure effects of np in the process",
    "@xmath16 , if they indeed show up in the observables , one needs to calculate the sm predictions with a rather good accuracy . in general , the sm amplitude consists of the short - distance ( sd ) contributions and the long - distance ( ld ) ones .",
    "the former are expressed in terms of the wilson coefficients @xmath17 calculated in perturbative qcd up to a certain order in @xmath18 ; they carry information on processes at energy scales @xmath19 [ here @xmath18 is the effective qcd coupling constant ] .",
    "these coefficients are then evolved , using the renormalization group methods , to the energies related to the bottom quark mass @xmath20 .",
    "the ld terms include factorizable and nonfactorizable effects from virtual photons via the semileptonic operators @xmath21 and electromagnetic dipole penguin operator @xmath22 in the effective hamiltonian .",
    "the radiative corrections coming from the operators @xmath23 and the gluon penguin operator @xmath24 are also accurately accounted for ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the ld effects describing the hadronization process are expressed in terms of hadronic matrix elements of the @xmath25 operators between the initial @xmath6 and the @xmath5 final state .",
    "these matrix elements are parametrized in terms of form factors @xcite that are calculated with the help of light - cone sum rules ( lcsr ) @xcite or in soft - collinear effective theory @xcite .",
    "the form factors have large theoretical uncertainties that are presently the dominant uncertainties in the sm predictions for exclusive decays .",
    "the presence of additional ld effects originating from intermediate vector resonances @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30,@xmath31 complicates the description and makes it more model dependent .",
    "these resonances show up in the region of relatively small dilepton invariant mass @xmath32 , where @xmath33 . in order to suppress the charmonia contribution , often the region of large dilepton mass ( @xmath34 gev@xmath35 )",
    "is selected ; for example , babar and belle collaborations apply the corresponding experimental cuts  @xcite . in some cases",
    "the resonances @xmath36 are explicitly excluded in the analysis via the breit - wigner energy factors .",
    "the region of small dilepton invariant mass , @xmath37 gev , has attracted less attention so far . nevertheless , as was pointed out in @xcite",
    ", this region also has a high potential for searching for np effects . at small @xmath38",
    "the low - lying vector resonances modify the amplitude and thus may induce , in certain observables , the right - handed photon polarization , which is still small but not negligible .",
    "the presence of the photon propagator @xmath39 enhances the resonance contribution .",
    "recently , the authors of @xcite analyzed the angular distribution in the rare decay @xmath40 in the small-@xmath41 region , in order to test the possibility to measure this distribution at the lhcb .",
    "they have shown the feasibility of future measurements with small systematic uncertainties .    in the present paper",
    "we calculate the branching fraction @xmath42 and asymmetries in the @xmath43 decay at dilepton invariant mass @xmath44 gev . both the sd and ld effects in the amplitude are evaluated .",
    "we use the effective hamiltonian with the wilson coefficients in the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) approximation .",
    "the ld effects mediated by the resonances , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath45 with @xmath46 , are included explicitly in terms of amplitudes of the decays @xmath47 .",
    "the information on the latter amplitudes is taken from experiment if available ; otherwise it is taken from theoretical predictions .",
    "we also study the sensitivity of the observables in the @xmath48 decay to the choice of the form factors of the transition @xmath49 . in the literature there",
    "exists a large variety of models for these form factors .",
    "we choose a few models @xcite in our calculation .",
    "the other nontrivial aspect of the theory is the mass of the strange quark @xmath50 , as a nonzero value of @xmath50 leads to a small admixture of the right - handed photon polarization .",
    "therefore , we calculate observables with both zero and nonzero values of the strange quark mass .    we calculate the coefficients @xmath51 and @xmath52 , which determine , respectively ,",
    "@xmath53 and @xmath54 dependencies in the angular distributions of the leptons ( @xmath55 is the angle between the plane spanned by @xmath56 and the plane spanned by the decay products @xmath57 of the @xmath58 meson ) .",
    "the other observables , such as forward - backward asymmetry @xmath59 and polarization parameters of @xmath5 meson @xmath60 , are also calculated .",
