    "to search for new physics beyond the standard model , we have been looking for the lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) @xmath5 and @xmath6 decays in the belle experiment  @xcite at the kekb asymmetric - energy @xmath7 collider  @xcite .",
    "previously , we obtained the upper limits of @xmath8  @xcite and @xmath9  @xcite at the 90% confidence level ( cl ) , using about 86 fb@xmath10 of data recorded at the @xmath11 resonance .",
    "later , the babar collaboration obtained the upper limits @xmath12  @xcite and @xmath13  @xcite with 232.2 fb@xmath10of data . here",
    "we report our updated analysis with a data sample of 535 fb@xmath10 .",
    "the belle detector is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector ( svd ) , a 50-layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) , an array of aerogel threshold erenkov counters ( acc ) , a barrel - like arrangement of time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) , and an electromagnetic calorimeter comprised of csi(tl ) crystals ( ecl ) located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5  t magnetic field .",
    "an iron flux - return located outside of the coil is instrumented to detect @xmath14 mesons and to identify muons ( klm ) .",
    "the detector is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the basic analysis procedure is similar to our previous one @xcite .",
    "the selection criteria for @xmath15 are determined and optimized by examing monte carlo ( mc ) simulated singal and background ( bg ) events , including the generic @xmath16 , @xmath17 @xmath18 , bhabha , @xmath19 , and two - photon events .",
    "the bg @xmath20 events are generated by the kkmc / tauola  @xcite and the response of the belle detector is simulated by the geant3  @xcite based program .",
    "photon candidates are defined as in ref .",
    "muon candidates are identified by using a muon likelihood ratio , @xmath21  @xcite , which is based on the difference between the range of the track calculated from the particle momentum and that measured by the klm , which includes the value of @xmath22 formed from the klm hit locations with respect to the extrapolated track .",
    "identification of electrons is performed using an electron likelihood ratio , @xmath23 , based on the @xmath24 information from the cdc , the ratio of the energy deposited in the ecl to the momentum measured by both the cdc and the svd , the shower shape in the ecl , the hit information from the acc and the matching between the positions of the charged track and the ecl cluster  @xcite .",
    "we select events that include exactly two oppositely - charged tracks and at least one photon , consistent with @xmath26 decays : one @xmath27 ( signal side ) decays to @xmath28 and the other ( tag side ) decays to a charged particle that is not a muon ( denoted hereafter as @xmath29 ) , neutrino(s ) and any number of photons .",
    "each track should have a momentum @xmath30 4.5 gev/@xmath31 in the center - of - mass ( cm ) frame and transverse component to the beam axis @xmath32 0.1 gev/@xmath31 within the detector fiducial region @xmath33 to avoid contamination from bhabha and @xmath34 events .",
    "( hereafter all the variables defined in the cm frame have superscripts `` cm . '' ) each photon is required to have an energy @xmath35 gev within the fiducial region .",
    "the total energy in the cm frame should be @xmath36 gev to further suppress bhabha and @xmath19 events .",
    "the magnitude of the thrust vector , constructed from all selected charged tracks and photons above , is required to be in the range from 0.90 to 0.98 in order to suppress @xmath19 and @xmath17 events .",
    "[ cutmg](a ) ) .    for muon identification",
    ", we require a likelihood ratio @xmath37 0.95 and @xmath38 1.0  gev/@xmath31 . on the tag side ,",
    "a track with @xmath39 0.8 is defined as @xmath29 .",
    "the photon that forms a @xmath40 candidate is required to have @xmath41 0.5 gev and @xmath42 to remove spurious combinations of @xmath43 s .    the opening angle between the @xmath44 and @xmath43 of @xmath45 , 0.4 @xmath46 0.8 , is particularly powerful in rejecting @xmath26 background , which contains @xmath47 s from @xmath48 decays .",
    "the sum of the energies of the two charged tracks and the photon of the @xmath40 , @xmath49 , should be less than 9.0 gev to reject @xmath34 events .",
    "the opening angle between the two tracks should be greater than 90@xmath50 in the cm frame while the opening angle between the @xmath44 and the boost direction of its mother @xmath48 from the cm frame in the @xmath48 rest frame is required to satisfy @xmath51 , to remove combinations of @xmath44 and @xmath43 from bg .",
    "the following constraints on the momentum and the polar angle of the missing particle are imposed : @xmath52 0.4 gev/@xmath31 and @xmath53 . here ,",
    "@xmath54 is calculated by subtracting the momentum of all charged tracks and photons from the beam momenta . to remove the @xmath26 background , a requirement on an opening between the tag - side track and the missing particle",
    "is applied , 0.4 @xmath55 0.98 .",
    "we calculate the missing mass squared on the tag side , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) is",

    "[ cutmg](b ) .",
    "finally , a condition is imposed on the relation between @xmath54 and the mass squared of a missing particle , @xmath64 : @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the sum of the beam energies minus the sum of all visible energy and is calculated assuming the muon ( pion ) mass for the charged track on the signal ( tag ) side , @xmath54 is in gev/@xmath31 and @xmath68 is in gev/@xmath69 .      after the selection requirements described in the previous subsection , the dominant bg source is @xmath26 events with the decay @xmath70 and a photon from initial state radiation or beam bg .",
    "other sources are the radiative @xmath34 process and @xmath26 events with @xmath71 .",
    "two variables are used to identify the signals : @xmath72 , the invariant mass of ( @xmath73 ) , and @xmath74 , the energy difference between the @xmath45 energy and the beam energy in the cm frame , where the signal should have @xmath75 @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the resolutions in @xmath72 and @xmath78 are estimated by fitting asymmetric gaussians to the signal mc distributions giving @xmath79 mev@xmath80  and @xmath81 mev , where @xmath82 means the standard deviation at the higher / lower side of the peak .    to compare the data and mc simulation , we examine a @xmath83 region with @xmath84 gev@xmath80  @xmath85 gev@xmath80  and @xmath86 gev@xmath87 gev , as seen in fig .",

    "2d_mg](a ) , whose detection efficiency is @xmath89 , is covered till the final stage of the analysis .",
    "after the selections , we find 71 events remaining in data and 73.4@xmath90 events remaining in mc in the @xmath83 region outside of the blinded ellipse .",
    "the latter is dominated by @xmath20 events with initial state radiation , @xmath91 , and is comprised of @xmath92 @xmath93 @xmath94 events , @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 events , with incorrect @xmath44 identification , and @xmath98 @xmath99 two - photon events , where the numbers in the parentheses are the bgs that remain in the entire sample .",
    "this background composition was understood in the previous analysis ; the @xmath94 process yields contributions in the @xmath100 region , while @xmath97 events mostly have @xmath101 .",
    "the latter rate is @xmath10220% of the former , and one additional small contribution of @xmath1025% is known to exist .",
    "this bg distribution is well represented by a combination of landau and gaussian functions , as found in ref .",
    "the final event distribution in this data sample is found to follow well the bg function ; the @xmath103 contribution is @xmath104 of the @xmath105 contribution , while the rest ( @xmath106 ) is from the two - photon process @xmath107 .",
    "after unblinding , we find 23 and 94 data events in the blinded and @xmath83 regions , respectively , while @xmath108 and @xmath109 events are expected from the mc .",
    "figure  [ 2d_mg](a ) shows the event distributions in the @xmath72@xmath78 plane .    in order to extract the number of signal events ,",
    "we employ an unbinned extended maximum likelihood ( ueml ) fit with the following likelihood function : @xmath110 here , @xmath111 is the number of observed events , @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the numbers of signal and bg events to be extracted , respectively , @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the signal and bg probability density functions ( pdf ) , where @xmath116 indicates the @xmath116-th event , @xmath114 is obtained from the signal mc , and @xmath115 is the pdf for background mentioned above , whose distribution is concentrated around @xmath117 gev , as indicated by the solid line in fig .  [ 2d_mg](a ) . to enhance the signal detection sensitivity and to avoid this dense bg region",
    ", we use a @xmath118 ellipse as the signal region for the ueml fit .",
    "the result of the fit is @xmath119 , @xmath120 with @xmath121 .",
    "figure  [ 2d_mg](b ) shows the event distribution within the @xmath118 band of the shorter ellipse axis , projected onto the longer ellipse axis , and the best fit curve .",
    "no events are found around the peak of the signal distribution .",
    "the negative @xmath112 value is consistent with no signal .",
    "we examine the probability for obtaining this result and evaluate the 90% cl upper limit using a toy mc simulation .",
    "the toy mc generates signal and bg events according to their pdfs fixing the expected number of bg events @xmath122 at @xmath123 while varying the number of signal events ( @xmath124 ) . for every assumed @xmath124 ,",
    "10,000 samples are generated following poisson statistics with means @xmath124 and @xmath125 for the signal and bg , respectively ; the signal yield @xmath126 is evaluated by the ueml fit . to obtain the upper limit at 90% cl ( @xmath127 )",
    "we take the @xmath124 value that gives a 90% probability of @xmath128 to be larger than @xmath124 .",
    "the probability to obtain @xmath129 is 25% in a case of a null true signal . in other words , due to",
    "bg fluctuations a negative @xmath112 value is possible with a large probability , although the physical signal rate is positive  @xcite .",
    "the toy mc provides an upper limit on the signal at the 90% cl as @xmath130 events from the result of the ueml fit .",
    "we then obtain the upper limit on the branching fraction @xmath131 at the 90% cl as @xmath132 where the number of @xmath48 pairs produced is @xmath133 , and the detection efficiency for the @xmath118 ellipse region is @xmath134 .    the systematic uncertainties for the bg pdf shape increase @xmath127 to 2.2 .",
    "the systematic uncertainties for @xmath135 arise from the track reconstruction efficiency ( 2.0% ) , the photon reconstruction efficiency ( 2.0% ) , the selection criteria ( 2.2% ) , the luminosity ( 1.4% ) , the trigger efficiency ( 0.9% ) , and the mc statistics ( 0.3% ) .",
    "all errors are added in quadrature to yield the total uncertainty of 4.0% .",
    "this uncertainty increases the upper limit of the branching ratio by 0.2%  @xcite .",
    "since the angular distribution for @xmath136 depends on the lfv interaction structure , we evaluate its effect on the result by assuming the maximum possible variation , @xmath137 interactions , rather than the uniform distribution so far assumed in the mc analysis .",
    "no appreciable effect is found for the upper limit .",
    "finally , the following upper limit on the branching ratio is obtained : @xmath138",
    "for @xmath140 we use a procedure similar to that for @xmath25 .",
    "we examine a @xmath26 sample , in which one @xmath48 goes to an electron and a photon , and the other @xmath48 decays to a charged particle , but not an electron ( @xmath141 ) , neutrino(s ) and any number of photons .",
    "the selection criteria are basically the same as those for @xmath136 , so below we describe only the differences .",
    "an obvious difference is the replacement of the @xmath44 by an @xmath142 on the signal side , and using a @xmath141 veto rather than a @xmath29 veto on the tag side .",
    "the electron on the signal side @xmath143 is required to have @xmath144 0.90 and a momentum @xmath38 1.0 gev/@xmath31 , while the @xmath141 on the tag side should have @xmath145 0.1 .",
    "minor differences in the kinematical selection include requirements on the missing mass squared on the tag side and the opening angle between the tag - side track and the missing particle on the tag side : @xmath146 ( gev@xmath61/@xmath62 ) @xmath147 ( gev@xmath61/@xmath62 ) , and 0.4 @xmath148 0.99 .",
    "the other requirements are the same as those for @xmath136 .",
    "the @xmath149 and @xmath150 resolutions are evaluated as @xmath151 mev@xmath80  and @xmath152 mev , and then the @xmath83 region over @xmath84 gev@xmath80",
    "@xmath85 gev@xmath80  and @xmath153 gev  @xmath154 gev   is assigned for the signal evaluation .",
    "a slanting @xmath155 ellipse is also blinded .",
    "after the selection , we find 34 and @xmath156 events remaining in data and mc , respectively , in the @xmath83 region , but excluding the blind one .",
    "the bg is from @xmath94 events ; no other bg process is found to contribute .",
    "after opening the blind we find 13 and 55 data events in the blind and @xmath83 region , respectively , while the mc predicts @xmath157 and @xmath158 events .",
    "figure  [ 2d_eg](a ) shows the event distribution in the @xmath72@xmath78 plane .",
    "the signal extraction process is the same as that for @xmath136 , described in the former section .",

    "no other background source is found in mc .",
    "the ueml fit over the @xmath118 ellipse region results in @xmath161 , @xmath162 with @xmath163 .",
    "the toy mc gives a probability of 48% for obtaining @xmath164 in the case of a null signal .",

    "the upper limit on the branching fraction is calculated as @xmath167 where the detection efficiency for the @xmath118 ellipse region is @xmath168 .",
    "the systematic uncertainties are essentially the same as those for @xmath136 : minor differences are the selection criteria ( 2.5% ) , and the trigger efficiency ( 2.0% ) .",
    "the total uncertainty amounts to 4.5% , and it increases the upper limit of the branching ratio by 0.2% .",
    "in addition , the systematic uncertainties for the bg pdf shape increase @xmath127 to 3.4 .",
    "taking into account this systematic error , we obtain the 90% cl upper limit , @xmath169",
