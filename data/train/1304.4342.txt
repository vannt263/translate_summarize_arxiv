    "interference phenomena in mesoscopic electronic systems require phase coherence , which is cut beyond the so - called dephasing time @xmath10 . at low temperatures @xmath11 , where",
    "phonons are frozen out , dephasing is caused mainly by electron interactions , which lead to a finite dephasing rate @xcite @xmath12 .",
    "in large systems with a small thouless energy , @xmath13 , dephasing crucially depends on dimensionality and geometry@xcite . however , if the system is finite and @xmath14 , spatial coordinates become unimportant and a 0d regime of rather weak dephasing is expected to occur @xcite .",
    "this regime is characterized by a universal temperature dependence of the dephasing rate , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the mean - level spacing .",
    "this @xmath17-dependence of @xmath9 can be explained by simple power counting : pauli blocking restricts the number of available final scattering states of the electrons , therefore both the energy transfer and the available phase - space are @xmath18 , similar to the standard result for a clean fermi - liquid .",
    "however , despite the fundamental nature and the physical importance of 0d dephasing , attempts to observe it experimentally in mesoscopic systems have been unsuccessful so far .    in transport experiments ,",
    "the 0d regime is generally difficult to observe , since quantum transport is almost insensitive to @xmath9 at @xmath19 .",
    "for example , the weak localization correction to the classical dc conductivity is cut mainly by the dwell time , @xmath20 , see ref .",
    "[ ] for a detailed discussion .",
    "this is an unavoidable problem which occurs in any open system even if the coupling to leads is weak .    in this work ,",
    "we concentrate on interference phenomena in isolated systems , where @xmath21 and where 0d dephasing is not masked by the coupling to the environment . deeply in the 0d regime at @xmath22 , the spectrum of the isolated system is discrete @xcite and , in the absence of other mechanisms of dephasing , random matrix theory ( rmt ) can be used as a starting point for an effective low - energy theory at @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , rmt is not appropriate for a systematic account of dephasing .",
    "if one is interested in the ( almost 0d ) regime @xmath24 , where the spectrum is not yet discrete , the usual mesoscopic perturbation theory @xcite can be used , which is able to take into account dephasing in all regimes .",
    "however , the description of quantum effects in isolated systems provides a further technical challenge .",
    "namely , the usual perturbation theory is well developed for a fixed chemical potential @xmath25 ; i.e. it describes systems in the grand - canonical ensemble ( gce ) . realizing the canonical ensemble ( ce ) , where the number of particles is fixed instead , can be rather tricky , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "[ ] . in the following , we assume that a description in terms of the so - called fermi - level pinning ensemble introduced in ref .  [ ] and [ ] is applicable @xcite .",
    "the dephasing rate of an isolated mesoscopic system can be explored , for instance , by measuring quantum components of the electrical polarizability @xmath26 at a given frequency @xmath27 : @xmath28 here @xmath29 is a spatially homogeneous electric field and @xmath30 is the total induced dipole moment in the sample .",
    "gorkov and eliashberg studied the polarizability in the seminal work ref .",
    "[ ] by using results from rmt and found very large quantum corrections . later , it was shown in ref .",
    "[ ] that the corrections are significantly reduced if screening is taken into account correctly @xcite .",
    "efetov reconsidered gorkov and eliashberg s calculation in ref .",
    "[ ] and derived a formula which accounts for screening in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) and expresses the quantum corrections to @xmath26 in terms of correlation functions of the wave - functions and energy levels of the system .",
    "@xcite used a simple model supported by numerical simulations to analyze the difference between the gce and the ce , and established that the quantum corrections are always small for systems with a large dimensionless conductance .",
    "subsequently , mirlin and blanter @xcite studied the polarizability using a combination of rmt and the diffusive @xmath7-model .",
    "in particular , they have calculated @xmath31-dependence of @xmath26 at @xmath32 for the case of the ce at @xmath33 . thus , neither the temperature nor the magnetic field dependence of @xmath34 has been described until now .    besides the progress made in theory ,",
    "experimental measurements of the quantum corrections have been reported in ref .  [ ] and [ ] .",
    "the authors measured the @xmath35-dependence of the polarizability of small metallic rings placed in a superconducting resonator ( with a fixed frequency @xmath31 ) in a perpendicular magnetic field and tried to extract the @xmath35-dependence of @xmath36 by using an empirical fitting equation .",
    "a fingerprint of 0d dephasing was found at low temperatures , though a reliable identification of the temperature dependence of @xmath37 calls for a more rigorous theory .",
    "motivated by the experimental results , we develop a perturbative theory for the quantum corrections @xmath38 to the polarizability by using the mesoscopic `` loop - expansion '' in diffusons and cooperons , where @xmath39 plays the role of a cooperon mass .",
    "we have chosen the experimentally relevant parameter range @xmath40 .",
    "generically , the difference between the gce and the ce can be important up to energies substantially exceeding @xmath1 , see the discussions in ref .",
    "[ ] . to check whether this statement also applies for @xmath41 , we calculate leading and subleading corrections in the fermi - level pinning ensemble .",
    "the former corresponds solely to the one - loop answer of the gce while the latter includes the two - loop answer of the gce and additional terms generated by fixing the number of particles in the ce .",
    "we show that , within our approach , the leading term of the perturbative expansion for @xmath42 suffices for its theoretical description in the experimentally relevant parameter range of ref .",
    "[ ] and [ ] .",
    "this important result of the present paper allows us to find the dependence of @xmath43 on temperature and on magnetic field .",
    "our theoretical results are in good qualitative agreement with the experiments , though we show that the present experimental data are not sufficient for a reliable identification of 0d dephasing .",
    "we suggest repeating the experimental measurements with higher precision and lower frequencies and using the fitting procedures which we propose in the present paper .",
    "we have good hopes that the elusive 0d regime of dephasing may be detectable in this manner in the near future .",
