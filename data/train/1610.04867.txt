    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the brightest explosions in the universe . during their early phases ( i.e. , prompt emission ) ,",
    "most of their energy is released in the gamma - ray band and the typical duration is a few seconds to hundreds of seconds . the standard theoretical model for grbs is the synchrotron shock model ( see * ? ? ? * for reviews ) ; gamma rays are emitted through non - thermal synchrotron emission via the internal dissipation of bulk kinetic energy of relativistic outflows , originating from a relativistically expanding fireball @xcite .",
    "most observational spectra are well fitted by an empirical function of two smoothly connected power laws ( e.g. , band function proposed by * ? ? ?",
    "however , observations by the egret instrument onboard the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ suggested an additional spectral component in the high - energy band , which was not simply an extrapolation from the band component during the prompt emission @xcite .",
    "the _ fermi _ observatory has achieved unprecedented broad - band sensitivity over seven decades in energy thanks to its two instruments : the gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) covering the energy band from 8 kev to 40 mev @xcite and the large area telescope ( lat ) which is sensitive at the higher energy range from 20 mev to @xmath1300 gev @xcite .",
    "_ fermi _ has securely confirmed a distinct additional power - law component in several grbs : e.g. , grb 090510 @xcite , grb 090902b @xcite , grb 090926 @xcite , grb 110731b @xcite and grb 130427a @xcite .",
    "although several models have been proposed to explain the mechanism behind the additional power - law component , its physical origin is still unclear .",
    "several possible theoretical models exist : synchrotron self - compton in internal shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , hadronic cascade in internal shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and synchrotron emission from the external forward shock ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , some grbs have harder low - energy power - law indices of the band component than expected from the synchrotron regime of the fast cooling case ( @xmath0 = @xmath23/2 ) and the slow cooling case ( @xmath0 = @xmath22/3 ) @xcite .",
    "this is known as the synchrotron line of death @xcite , and likely indicates that there exists a thermal component originating from the photosphere ( @xmath0 @xmath3 1 if it is in the rayleigh - jeans regime ) . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", ultra - relativistic expansion of the fireball predicts a thermal component in grb spectra .",
    "indeed , a thermal component has been clearly identified in some grbs by batse and _ fermi_. while thermal emission is sub - dominant compared with non - thermal emission in most of the cases ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , some grbs have a dominant quasi - thermal component from a few tens of kev to a few mev ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper , we present the observation and analysis of x - ray and gamma - ray emission from the long grb 141207a by the _",
    "fermi _ and _ swift _ instruments @xcite in sections [ sec : observation ] and [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "the detailed characteristics of the obtained light curves and spectra are described in sections [ sec : lightcurve ] and [ sec : spectralanalysis ] , respectively . the obtained spectrum of grb 141207a has a statistically significant high - energy power - law component which can not be extrapolated from the band component , and the dominant quasi - thermal emission is detected in the early phase of the prompt emission .",
    "the origin of the high - energy power - law component and the physical parameters of the thermal emission are discussed in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "furthermore , although its redshift is unclear , we estimated a possible redshift using an empirical correlation between the peak energy in the @xmath4 space ( @xmath5 ) and an isotropic equivalent luminosity @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the obtained pseudo - redshift is very high ( @xmath7 @xmath3 10 ) .",
    "on 2014 december 7 , grb 141207a triggered the _ fermi_-gbm instruments at 19:11:21.10 ut @xcite , which measured high - energy emission up to 2 mev .",
    "the burst s duration in the 50  300 kev band was estimated to be @xmath8 = 21.0 @xmath9 0.6 s where @xmath8 is the time over which 5% to 95% of the total measured photons are detected .",

    "after the downlink and processing of the _",
    "fermi_-lat data , we found significant emission above 100 mev @xcite , which is temporally correlated with the gbm emission . furthermore , the lat low energy ( lle ) data from 20 mev to @xmath15 100 mev energies also shows emission coincident with that at higher energies in the lat data at a 10-@xmath13 level , where lle data @xcite consist of events with a very loose event selection . the calculated location using the lat data",

    "= @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( j2000 ) with an error radius of @xmath18 ( 90% containment ) , which is spatially consistent with the gbm position . the lat covered the beginning of the gbm emission and observed the burst until 1600 s after the trigger .",
    "gev emission was significantly detected by the lat , with 6 photons above 1 gev in the initial 100 s and a highest - energy photon of 5.5 gev observed 734 s after the gbm trigger .",
    "target of opportunity observations by the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) and the ultraviolet and optical telescope ( uvot ) onboard _ swift _ began @xmath313 hours after the gbm trigger .",

    "while the x - ray counterpart was detected , no significant emission in the _ u _ band was confirmed by uvot .",
    "although a ground - based optical observation was performed 16 hours after the trigger @xcite , no optical source was detected because the fading x - ray source was outside the fov , and a redshift could therefore not be measured .",
    "for the temporal and spectral analyses of the burst , we used gbm and lat data obtained from the _ fermi _ science support center server and followed the standard analysis procedure using _ fermi _ science tools . for the gbm analysis",
    ", we used three nai detectors within a burst angle of 60@xmath14 ( nais 0 , 3 and 4 ) and the brightest bgo detector ( bgo 0 ) .    for the lat data , instrument response functions ( irfs )",
    "were recently greatly updated by improving knowledge of the lat detector and the operation environment ( pass8 ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a result , a significant reduction of background events and increase of effective area were accomplished . in this paper , we used data with  p8transient010e \" and  p8source \" instrument response functions ( irfs ) when analyzing the prompt emission and extended emission ( e.g. , early afterglow ) , respectively .",
    "the p8transient010e data come from a loose - cut filter optimized for short - time transients ( @xmath3100 s ) under background - suppressed conditions and p8source data has a tighter filter than p8transient010e , which is suitable for analysis of longer time intervals ( @xmath22 1000 s ) to reduce the contribution of background events ( e.g. , charged particles , cosmic rays etc . ) .",
    "we also performed an analysis using _ swift _ xrt data . to extract the light curve and spectrum , we utilized the method of automatic analysis based on @xcite .",
    "we show the composite light curves including the gbm and lat data in figure [ compositelc ] . the observed",
    "light curves clearly show that the gamma - ray emission above 20 mev detected by the lat is delayed by @xmath33.4 s with respect to the gbm emission at energies @xmath23 1 mev .",
    "this delay is also suggested by the light curve of the 1  10 mev band of the bgo detector and is a common feature observed in other grbs @xcite .",
    "the highest - energy photons in the initial 100s interval and the whole interval until @xmath24 + 1600 s , where the significant gev emission was detected , are 3.4 gev and 5.5 gev observed at @xmath24 + 4.8 s and @xmath24 + 734 s , respectively . to estimate",
    "how well these photons are associated with the grb , we calculated chance probabilities that these two photons originate from background events such as galactic or extragalactic diffuse emission to be 1.16@xmath2510@xmath26 and 1.47@xmath2510@xmath27 respectively , using the gtsrcprob analysis provided by the _",
    "fermi _ science tools .",
    "thus , the detected highest - energy photons are very likely to originate from grb141207a .",
    "the standard @xmath28 duration in the gbm energy range ( 50  300 kev ) is 21.0 @xmath9 0.6 s and we define the time interval where the gbm emission clearly appeared ( from @xmath24 @xmath2 0.5 s to + 24 s ) as a prompt emission phase . in the prompt emission phase ,",
    "the duration in the lat band is almost the same as or slightly shorter than in the gbm band , although the number of the lat photons is small and there is a large uncertainty due to photon statistics .    in order to perform time - resolved spectroscopy to characterize the spectral evolution of this burst",
    ", we chose five time intervals , which are indicated by vertical lines in figure [ compositelc ] .",
    "in the first time interval ( from @xmath24 @xmath20.5 s to + 2.9 s , labeled  @xmath29 \" ) , while there were no lat photons , significant emission is present in the gbm . the second time interval ( from @xmath24 + 2.9 s to 6 s ,",
    " @xmath30 \" ) contains the first bright lat emission episode coincident with the gbm pulse . in the third time interval",
    "( from @xmath24 + 6 s to 12 s ,  @xmath31 \" ) there were prominent gbm pulses and lat emission . in the fourth time interval ( from @xmath24 + 12 s to 20 s ,  @xmath32 \" ) there was no emission in the high - energy gbm band ( @xmath22300 kev ) , yet emission in the low - energy gbm band ( 8  100 kev ) and lat emission were detected . in the fifth time interval ( from @xmath24 + 20",
    "s to 24 s ,  @xmath33 \" ) a rebrightening of the gbm emission is seen while there are few lat photons .",
    "figure [ ee_lat_swift ] shows the extended emission detected by lat at longer timescales than the prompt phase , until 1600 s after the gbm trigger time .",
    "when calculating the lat flux , we used the test statistic ( @xmath34 ; * ? ? ? * ) to estimate the statistical significance and test whether lat emission was significant or not .",
    "the significance in units of the standard deviation scales roughly as @xmath35 .",
    "the long - lasting emission was detected until 1600 s after the trigger with a confidence level greater than 4.5 @xmath13 .",
    "the lat flux decreases with time and follows a power - law function of @xmath36 .",
    "the temporal index is similar to other grbs @xcite .",
    "the photon index is almost constant with values between @xmath21.5 and @xmath22.0 .",
    "xrt also detected the fading x - ray emission and its temporal decay index is @xmath21.9@xmath90.6 , which is consistent with the lat temporal index within 1-@xmath13 uncertainty .",
    "we performed time - integrated and time - resolved spectral analyses with the gbm and lat data for the defined time intervals and show comparisons of fit results for each time interval in table [ spec_result_exp_comp ] .",
    "when performing spectral analysis , we used _",
    "xspec _ version 12.8.2 @xcite . for the fitting procedure",
    ", we adopted the  pgstat \" statistic , suitable for low count statistics @xcite .",
    "first , we performed the time - integrated spectral analysis during @xmath24 @xmath2 0.5 s to + 24 s , denoted as  total \" in table [ spec_result_exp_comp ] .",
    "we fitted these initial 24.5 s of the prompt emission using the empirical band function and obtained a fluence of ( 7.47 @xmath9 0.30 ) @xmath25 10@xmath37 erg @xmath38 over the whole gbm + lat energy range ( 8 kev  10 gev ) .",
    "the obtained spectrum is shown in figure [ specsummaryband ] .",
    "three models - the band function , the band function plus blackbody ( bb ) and the band plus power - law ( pl ) functions - were tested .",
    "fitting only the band function shows systematic bumps around 10 kev and a few gev as shown in the residuals of the band function - only fits of figure [ specsummaryband ] .",
    "this indicates that an additional spectral component is needed .",
    "thus , to mitigate the residuals of the low - energy wavy structure , a bb component was added .",
    "the statistical improvement ( i.e. , goodness of fit ) is qualitatively estimated by the difference in pgstat values , hereafter denoted as @xmath39pgstat , and by adding the bb component a drastic improvement of @xmath39pgstat = 72 for an increase of 2 degrees of freedom ( band vs. band+bb ) is obtained , although the residuals around a few gev still remain as a bump as shown in the residual of band + bb in figure [ specsummaryband ] .",
    "the remaining high - energy bump indicates that there could exist an extra high - energy component .",
    "we next adopted the pl function as an extra component instead of the bb component to reduce the residual of both the low - energy and high - energy bumps as shown in the residual of band + pl in figure [ specsummaryband ] .",
    "the obtained statistical improvement of @xmath39pgstat = 97 ( band vs. band+pl ) is slightly better than the case of band vs. band+bb . considering both cases ,",
    "the obtained spectrum can not be well explained by only a band function and an extra component is clearly needed .",
    "however , the improvement of @xmath39pgstat = 25 ( band+bb vs. band+pl ) is not large compared with the previous cases ( i.e. , band vs. band+bb or band vs. band+pl ) and we need a null hypothesis probability to estimate how significant band+pl is relative to band+bb .    to estimate the significance of the power - law component we use a monte - carlo simulation .",
    "the explicit procedure is the following : ( 1 ) first , we derived a best - fit function as a null hypothesis ( band+bb ) from the obtained spectrum .",
    "( 2 ) using the derived best - fit parameters , dummy spectra were created with the _ fakeit _ command of _ xspec_. in this paper , we tried 1 million realizations .",
    "( 3 ) we obtained the best - fit parameters with the null hypothesis model ( i.e. , band+bb ) for each realization . ( 4 ) the same fitting with an alternative model ( e.g. , band+pl ) was performed .",
    "( 5 ) we calculated @xmath39pgstat between the null hypothesis and alternative models for each realization .",
    "finally , this gives the reference probability distribution .",
    "@xmath39pgstat = 25 corresponds to a probability of @xmath310@xmath37 that the best - fit function will be band+pl if the underlying function is band+bb .",
    "we thus can say that band+pl is a more likely model to represent the obtained time - integrated spectrum .",
    "although we tried a three - component model ( i.e. , band+pl+bb ) , we did not obtain any statistically significant improvements ( @xmath39pgstat @xmath40 3 ) and in particular the additional bb parameters are not well constrained .",
    "furthermore , we tried the three - component function at several separated time intervals as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ subsec : coarsetimeresolvspec ] and [ sec : finetimeresolvedspec ] . however , we confirm that there is no significant improvement in any time interval by adopting the three - component model .",
    "the low - energy photon index of the band component is large ( @xmath0 @xmath3 @xmath20.1 ) and such a hard index can not be explained by the synchrotron emission model which limits the expected photon indices to @xmath0 @xmath41 @xmath23/2 or @xmath22/3 for the fast- and slow - cooling cases , respectively @xcite .",
    "the obtained photon index suggested that the band component should not originate from the synchrotron emission by accelerated electrons but instead from a thermal process ; the low - energy photon index would then relate to the spectral slope in the rayleigh - jeans regime of the blackbody component ( @xmath0 = + 1 ) .",

    "the physical origin of the extra pl component is still under debate , but both the internal and external shock origins are likely . for the internal - shock origin , there are two possibilities : leptonic and hadronic models .",
    "the leptonic models produce the gev emission via synchrotron self - compton emission and/or comptonization of thermal photons by electrons , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in the case of grb 141207a",
    ", the gbm emission originates from the photosphere and the photosphere region is much smaller than the internal shock region which would contribute to the lat emission .",
    "although these regions are not co - spatial , the thermal photon from the photosphere could play the role of the seed photon responsible for the lat emission via inverse compton scattering .",
    "under this assumption , we would expect that the high - energy emission in the ( sub- ) gev band should be temporally correlated with the seed photon emission around the sub - mev peak . as shown in figure [ flux_bb_nth ] , the thermal component seems to be highly variable with time while the pl component is almost independent of time . in order to estimate the correlation between the thermal and non - thermal components , we calculate the correlation coefficient , obtaining a value of 0.37@xmath90.22 , with a probability of 16% that there is no correlation .",
    "this result is not very constraining because of large uncertainties and limited photon statistics especially for the lat .",
    "therefore , we can not claim that there exists no correlation between the thermal and non - thermal components and the leptonic scenario can not be rejected . however , the low - energy excess below the peak energy of the thermal component is difficult to explain via an inverse compton scenario .",
    "for the hadronic models , accelerated high - energy protons originating from the internal shocks trigger an electronic cascade caused by photopion production , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the cascade emission could easily realize an additional pl component with a flat spectrum ( photon index @xmath3 @xmath21.9 ) in a very broad energy band , from a few kev to a few gev .",
    "furthermore , a strong magnetic field can be invoked for high photo - meson production efficiency in order to avoid an extremely large proton luminosity , while for the leptonic models a large magnetic field drastically decreases the contribution of the inverse compton component .",
    "in addition , as the proton acceleration timescale is much longer than the electron cooling time , the variability timescale of the pl component may be broadened @xcite .",
    "although the photon statistics are not significant to verify the broadness of the pulse profile in the gev light curve , the hadronic model represents a valuable choice for interpreting this grb .    besides the internal shock scenario , we suggest the es scenario , e.g. , @xcite : synchrotron emission is produced via an external forward shock and the lat emission originates from the early onset of the afterglow . as described in section [ sec : afterglow ] , the obtained spectral and temporal parameters are consistent with the es model and the fact that the flux variability of the high - energy pl component does not seem to depend on time also may favor the es model .",
    "furthermore , the es model could explain the delay of the ( sub-)gev emission with respect to the x - ray gbm emission , corresponding to the deceleration onset of the es ( @xmath257 ) .",
    "from @xcite we obtain the deceleration radius as follows ,    @xmath258^{1/3 } \\label{eq : t_onset}\\ ] ]    if we take @xmath7 = 2 and @xmath245 @xmath188 1 cm@xmath26 , we obtain    @xmath259    the expected onset times are almost consistent with the observed temporal delay ( @xmath3 3 s ) , which might support a scenario where the lat emission in both the prompt and temporally extended phases is explained by the es model .",
    "the observed variability timescale in sec [ sec : constraintgamma ] is typically @xmath31 s and this is almost consistent with the deceleration timescale within an order of magnitude .",
    "however , we note that as shown in figure [ ee_lat_swift ] the observed photon index at late phase ( @xmath24 + 1000 s ) is larger than the expected one , although its uncertainty is large .",

    "we have assumed that _ z _ = 2 so far and we try to estimate the redshift for this grb using x - ray and gamma - ray data . to estimate the distances of grbs with unknown redshift , the empirical relationships between the peak energy @xmath5 and the isotropic equivalent luminosity @xmath6 could be useful , although the physical origin of this relationship is uncertain and conclusions drawn from it need to be treated with great caution .",
    "for example , some studies claim that such relations might be due to observational selection bias ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . while the yonetoku relation @xcite has been widely used when fitting the grb spectrum with a single band function , for some grbs with additional pl component it does not give a suitable result due to inclusion of the extra pl component .",
    "@xcite suggested treating the band and pl components separately and use only the contribution of the band component when establishing the empirical relationship .",
    "we decide to adopt the approach of @xcite to estimate the possible redshift of grb 141207a and we assume that the thermal component , which is also well fitted by the band function , is adopted as a spectral component used for the empirical relation .",
    "this assumption is quite strong ; @xcite fitted observed spectra with band + bb + pl , where the bb component was sub - dominant .",
    "they then used the dominant band component ( representing the non - thermal emission ) for their empirical relation . in our case , we assume that the band component comes from photospheric emission during which the additional pl component exists . to test whether this assumption is valid",

    "however , in our case the optical data was not observed during the prompt phase and there is no significant _ u_-band detection by uvot ( 3000 @xmath260  3900 @xmath260 ) in the afterglow phase . at @xmath7 @xmath3 2",
    ", the uvot band nearly corresponds to the wavelength of the lyman series .",
    "therefore , for @xmath7 @xmath1 2 the afterglow emission is expected to be very weak and the uvot observation is consistent with the high - z scenario .",
    "finally , we check if the very high-_z _ grb scenario ( _ z _ = 10.3 ) is compatible with the arguments previously discussed .",
    "first , the estimated minimum bulk lorentz factor is @xmath185 @xmath188 1100 with the same procedure in sec .",
    "[ sec : constraintgamma ] using the estimated high redshift .",
    "the derived physical parameters from the photospheric emission ( e.g. , @xmath172 , @xmath192 and @xmath261 ) change only within a factor of 4 and especially the obtained @xmath172 @xmath3 3000 does not contradict @xmath185 .",
    "when we discuss the es scenario , although we obtain the reasonable deceleration time of @xmath3 2 s ( @xmath244/3.5 @xmath25 10@xmath262 erg)@xmath263 ( @xmath245/ 1 cm@xmath26)@xmath264 ( @xmath172/3000)@xmath265 , the required isotropic kinematic energy of @xmath244 = 3.5 @xmath25 10@xmath262 erg seems to be extremely large and challenging .",
    "furthermore , the estimated maximum synchrotron energy under typical conditions ( not multiplying by 2@xmath253 ) is 1.0 gev at @xmath24 + 734 s and the observed photon with 5.5 gev highly exceeds the limit of the radiative afterglow model .    in summary , while the very high-_z _ scenario is partially consistent with results assuming that _ z _ = 2 , there are some big challenges ; e.g. , for the es model the required kinetic energy is extremely large ( @xmath3 10@xmath262 erg ) and the observed highest energy photon can not be easily explained by the es model .",
    "we caution that the empirical relation of @xcite was derived using a strong non - thermal component in the spectrum , whereas grb 141207a appears to be dominated by a thermal component .",
    "such grbs ( including for example grb 090902b ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may belong to a different population of grbs .",
    "in addition , the relation of @xcite has not been tested for high - redshift grbs .",
    "we have presented the observation , detailed analysis results and physical interpretations for grb 141207a .",
    "this burst has features typically seen in other lat - detected bursts , such as a delayed onset of the gev emission with respect to the x - ray emission and temporally extended emission in the lat range . during the first two pulses in the prompt emission phase , the spectrum of grb 141207a is well fitted by a band component with hard low - energy photon index or modified blackbody component plus an additional power - law component spanning a wide energy range from kev to gev , which indicates that this grb has a photospheric origin . in addition",
    ", our finely time - binned analysis shows that the estimated bulk lorentz factor @xmath172 @xmath3 1000 and the initial radius @xmath266 = 10  400 km depends on the unknown non - thermal efficiency @xmath205 .",
    "the physical origin of the non - thermal power - law component in the prompt phase is not understood , and we discussed whether the component can be explained by the leptonic and hadronic scenarios of the internal shock regime and synchrotron emission from external forward shock . due to the limited photon statistics , our temporal analysis is not able to distinguish those models , therefore we can not find strong evidence for a favorable one . observations of bright grbs by _ fermi _ will likely give us a key to disentangle these models .",
    "the temporally extended lat emission and the x - ray afterglow were also detected and the results obtained by the temporal and spectral analyses support the radiative external forward shock scenario .",
    "however , in the late phase of the extended emission in the lat band ( @xmath24 + 1000 s ) the spectra show signs of hardening with time , which can not be explained by synchrotron emission in the standard scenario and another contribution may exist .",
    "finally , our redshift estimate using the empirical @xmath5  @xmath6 relationship of @xcite may point to grb 141207a occurring in the very high - z universe ( @xmath7 @xmath3 10 ) .",
    "for such a high-_z _ event , an extremely large injection energy ( @xmath3 10@xmath262 erg ) is needed and there is an inconsistency with the external forward shock ( e.g. , the observed highest energy photon exceeds the maximum synchrotron energy ) .",
    "note that we used a controversial empirical relation for estimating the redshift , which is not verified for such a special type of energetic ( e.g. , pop iii ) grbs at high-_z _ universe .",
    "the _ fermi _ lat collaboration acknowledges generous ongoing support from a number of agencies and institutes that have supported both the development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis .",
    "these include the national aeronautics and space administration and the department of energy in the united states , the commissariat  lenergie atomique and the centre national de la recherche scientifique / institut national de physique nuclaire et de physique des particules in france , the agenzia spaziale italiana and the istituto nazionale di fisica nucleare in italy , the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology ( mext ) , high energy accelerator research organization ( kek ) and japan aerospace exploration agency ( jaxa ) in japan , and the k.  a.  wallenberg foundation , the swedish research council and the swedish national space board in sweden .",
