    "material failure is mediated by the propagation of cracks , which are spatially - extended dissipative defects that concentrate large deformation and stresses near their tips .",
    "the latter is an essential physical property of cracks that highlights their basic role in material failure : cracks strongly amplify remotely applied stresses near their tips , precipitating fracture as they propagate .",
    "the classic approach to the fracture of brittle materials , linear elastic fracture mechanics ( lefm ) @xcite , is a perturbative approach that treats all relevant physical quantities to linear order in the elastic deformation with respect to the undeformed state of the material . here , all nonlinearities and dissipation are assumed to be confined to a microscopically small region near the crack tip , and are neglected .",
    "lefm does not treat separately the effects of the externally applied loading ( pre - stress / strain ) and the presence of the crack itself , due to the linearity assumption .",
    "this physical picture makes sense as long the materials of interest fail when the applied forces are small and the deformation is indeed linear elastic ( i.e. infinitesimal ) everywhere except for the immediate vicinity of the crack tip .",
    "this has always been the case in `` traditional '' brittle materials such as glasses , ceramics and brittle polymers , where failure occurs at applied strains of the order of @xmath0 .",
    "recently , an extended theory of dynamic fracture  the `` weakly nonlinear theory of dynamic fracture ''  was developed @xcite .",
    "this theory still treats the large scales of a fracture problem as linear elastic , but explicitly takes into account the leading order nonlinear elastic corrections near the tip of a crack . in the latter region , strains are necessarily large and nonlinearities of the elastic fields are important for understanding the physical state that actually drives material failure .    the weakly nonlinear theory introduced a new intrinsic length scale ( i.e. independent of the external geometry and crack s dimensions ) that emerges from the competition between linear and weakly nonlinear deformation .",
    "the new length scale , which is missing in lefm and characterizes the scale near the crack tip where lefm breaks down , has been argued to play an important role in determining the crack s path @xcite and has been shown to play a decisive role in crack instabilities @xcite .",
    "this theory has recently received significant experimental support @xcite .",
    "of late , classes of materials in which large deformations precede failure have become increasingly important and have been extensively studied in various contexts .",
    "these highly - deformable materials include synthetic elastomers , biopolymers , gels and a broad range of soft biological tissues ( e.g. arterial walls , veins , skin , tendons etc . ) .",
    "reviewing even a small portion of the work done on the fracture of soft , highly - deformable , materials  which encompass various scientific disciplines and communities  goes well beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we can only mention here a few examples .",
    "the fracture resistance of some synthetic materials , such as double - network hydrogels made of ionically and covalently crosslinked networks @xcite , can be made to be enormous and new applications are expected to abound .",
    "basic phenomena such as delayed fracture of soft solids @xcite , and surface tension - induced and capillary fracture of gels @xcite have been studied . finally , the work of baumberger and coworkers on the quasi - static fracture of soft materials has both elucidated the fracture mechanisms of biopolymer gels @xcite and established the existence of an intrinsic length scale associated with elastic nonlinearities @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that many of the materials of interest here , although highly - deformable and tough , are still brittle .",
    "the materials that we are considering here are materials where high - deformability is dominated by nonlinear elastic behavior , with little ductility .",
    "this type of behavior is typical in many of the new tough elastomers that are being developed .",
    "since the bulk dissipation can be ignored , these materials are indeed brittle  as the only dissipation takes place in the near vicinity of the crack tip .",
    "when failure occurs under the application of large background deformation ( pre - stress / strain ) , the deformation is nonlinear everywhere in the material , invalidating the assumption of remote linear elastic deformation . to address this problem , some works considered the fully nonlinear field equations for certain classes of highly - deformable materials and non - perturbatively derived the leading asymptotic fields in the inner most crack tip region .",
    "the vast majority of these works focussed on static cracks @xcite , though not all @xcite .",
    "such an asymptotic approach would be useful if the asymptotic fields are generic and universally linked to the remote loading , something which has not yet been established .",
    "marder , following a different approach combining numerical and analytic techniques , developed a rather comprehensive dynamic fracture theory of rubber @xcite .",
    "despite these important efforts , we are still far from having a well - established general theory of the dynamic fracture of highly - deformable , strongly nonlinear , materials .    in this paper , we develop a theoretical framework in which the background , possibly finite ( nonlinear ) , deformation induced by the external loading in the absence of a crack ( pre - stress / strain ) is treated non - perturbatively .",
    "then , the effects of the crack on its near - tip region are treated perturbatively to _ second order _ with respect to the background deformation .",
    "this theory will be shown to offer quantitatively good approximations to experimental data at moderately large background deformation . consequently",
    ", we occasionally refer to it as the moderately large deformation theory .",
    "the development of a perturbative fracture theory in the presence of non - infinitesimal background deformation is conceptually non - trivial .",
    "it raises the following question : if the background deformation is finite ( nonlinear ) and a crack significantly amplifies the background ( remotely applied ) deformation near its tip , is it justified to treat the latter as a relatively small correction to the former ?    to quantitatively address this issue , we first develop the moderately large deformation theory and derive its near crack tip solutions ( both analytically and semi - analytically ) .",
    "we then systematically and quantitatively compare it to the weakly nonlinear theory .",
    "both theories are also compared to extensive direct measurements of the near - tip deformation fields of dynamic cracks propagating in a brittle elastomer gel , where the background deformation is increased in a controlled manner .",
    "our results show that while the two theories agree with each other at relatively small background deformation , the moderately large deformation theory offers significantly better approximations to the experimental data at moderately large levels of external loadings ( pre - stress / strain ) and high propagation velocities .",
    "theoretical frameworks that invoke perturbations of a pre - stressed state  which are sometimes referred to as `` mechanics of incremental deformation ''  are not new in themselves @xcite .",
    "a classical example is the theory of small amplitude waves in nonlinearly pre - stressed materials , which has recently attracted renewed attention @xcite . in this case ,",
    "a perturbative approach relative to the pre - stressed / strained state of the material is fully justified as the wave amplitude can remain small relative to the large background deformation . as explained above ,",
    "this is not automatically the case in fracture dynamics where the background deformation is significantly amplified near the crack tip and hence in principle may not be treated as a small perturbation .",
    "a number of authors have previously discussed such approaches to fracture  @xcite , where the effect of the crack was treated perturbatively to _ linear order _ with respect to the background deformation . as far as we can tell , however , these authors did not address at all the range of validity of the approach .",
    "in particular , their perturbative approach was confined to linear order , which  as we show below  is insufficient since higher order effects ( in particular , weakly nonlinear effects with respect to the background deformation ) play an important role .",
    "furthermore , to the best of our knowledge , quantitative comparisons of theoretical predictions to detailed experimental data , as we do here , have not previously been performed .",
    "we believe that the combined theoretical - experimental results presented in this paper offer a useful framework to quantitatively address the fracture properties and dynamics of highly - deformable materials .",
    "to lay down the theoretical grounds for the approach we propose , consider a dynamic crack propagating in a 2d nonlinear elastic solid described by an energy functional @xmath1 .",
    "the deformation gradient tensor @xmath2 is defined as @xmath3 , where the motion @xmath4 is a continuous , differentiable and invertible mapping between a reference ( undeformed ) configuration described by @xmath5 and a deformed configuration described by @xmath6 , such that @xmath7 .",

    "the crack is assumed to follow a straight trajectory and to propagate steadily at a velocity @xmath13 along the positive @xmath14-axis . under symmetric tensile loading along the @xmath15-axis , that is under mode - i fracture conditions ,",
    "the crack faces are being separated and hence are traction - free .",
    "these traction - free boundary conditions on the crack faces can be expressed in the undeformed configuration as @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a polar coordinates system co - moving with the crack tip ( @xmath18 is the tip location and @xmath19 is the propagation direction ) .    the solution of eq .",

    "a constitutive relation @xmath11 for a general nonlinear energy functional @xmath1 , is analytically intractable . to make progress , some approximations are invoked , most notably in situations in which fracture occurs under small background deformation . in such cases ,",
    "the displacement gradient tensor @xmath20 is treated as small everywhere except for a small zone around the crack tip , and a perturbative approach is developed .",
    "lefm @xcite and the weakly nonlinear theory of fracture @xcite fall under this category .",
    "highly - deformable materials , on the other hand , fail at large , nonlinear , background deformation and in principle the status of a perturbative approach is not clear .      to develop our approach , we write the motion @xmath21 as @xmath22 here we decompose the total motion into a contribution emerging from the external loading @xmath23 in the absence of a crack ( the pre - stress / strain ) , which are the stretches in the @xmath14 and @xmath15 directions respectively , and into the effect of the crack quantified by @xmath24 . for simplicity , and",

    "the predictions of the weakly nonlinear theory ( triangles ) and of the moderately large theory ( circles ) are presented for comparison.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    taken together , we believe that the quantitative analysis presented here clearly shows that the moderately large deformation framework offers significantly better approximations to the direct measurements than the weakly nonlinear theory at moderately large levels of external loadings and high propagation velocities .",
    "in this paper we developed and experimentally tested a dynamic fracture theory of highly - deformable materials which fail under the application of large external strains .",
    "the theory is based on a _ second order _ expansion in the displacement - gradients with respect to a nonlinearly stretched reference state . while the theory is mathematically well - defined , its physical range of applicability  and the mere existence of such a range  are not _ a - priori _ guaranteed .",
    "the reason for this is that as the background strains are already rather large , amplification of deformation near the crack tip may render a perturbative approach inappropriate .",
    "our direct experiments showed firstly that the background strain has a significant effect on the deformation fields surrounding crack tips . even at moderate strains",
    ", the standard theory fails to provide a good description of the near tip fields .",
    "secondly , and quite surprisingly , the experiments showed that the new theory provides a good description of these fields .",
    "this central finding emerged because the amplification of deformation in the region of interest was not enormous and due to the inclusion of second order terms in the theory .",
    "these results imply that the theory may have a robust range of applicability , at least at moderately large background strains and high propagation velocities , but possibly also at larger background deformation .",
    "this convincing experimental support indicates that the proposed theoretical development offers a framework to understand the dynamic fracture of soft materials that fail under large pre - stressing / straining ( of the order of @xmath167 or larger ) , going significantly beyond the standard fracture theory of ordinary materials that fail under strains of @xmath168 .",
    "the theory shows that in order to quantitatively understand the fields that drive material failure near crack tips , the deformation - induced anisotropy and fundamental material properties such as the fracture energy , the pre - stressing / straining needs to be properly taken into account in such materials .",
    "the theory may find applications in a range of problems dealing with the failure of soft materials , from food processing to tissue rupture .",
    "it is important to note that while some existing literature exclusively focusses on the inner most asymptotic crack tip region in highly - deformable materials @xcite , our theory takes into account the pre - strained / stressed large scales and links them to the near tip region as approached from the outside . as such",
    ", the theory should be regarded as intermediate asymptotics .",
    "the experiments presented above , which quantitatively support the theory , are able to probe this intermediate asymptotic region .",
    "one insight emerging from this work is that the form of these intermediate asymptotic solutions is highly influenced by the magnitude of the background deformations . in the classic lefm theory ,",
    "the loading and background stresses are solely accounted for by their influence on the intensity of the universal singularity , the stress intensity factor . here",
    ", we have shown that large strains inherent in the external loading actually influence the fields in a variety of subtle ways that can not solely be accommodated by a change in the value of the stress intensity factor .    finally , note that various highly - deformable materials fail under background deformation of the order of 100% or even larger , a regime that has not been probed by the experiments presented above .",
    "therefore , it remains to be seen in future work how far one can push the theoretical framework developed here .",
