    "in this paper we consider the situation of a single chain polymer confined within a space smaller than its radius of gyration .",
    "such a situation is encountered within the nucleus of a cell where one or more chromosomes with a radius of gyration on the order of 10 @xmath0 are confined by the nuclear membrane to a space of order 1 @xmath1 . even in the case of organisms where the genome is composed of many chromosomes ,",
    "the situation is distinct from that of a polymer melt as each chromosome is effectively confined to a separate sub - volume of the nucleus  @xcite . since many biological processes such as",
    "gene suppression and activation require a rearrangement of the dna polymer , understanding the dynamics of confined polymers may yield insight to the dynamics of these cellular activities .",
    "strongly confined polymers may also be encountered in the `` lab on a chip '' applications promised by microfluidic technology  @xcite . in these applications",
    "the reaction vessels are @xmath2 microdroplets .",
    "while the equilibrium properties of confined polymers may be understood based on scaling arguments  @xcite , the dynamics of confined polymers are less well understood , and there has been growing interest in the problem .",
    "for instance , the transport of polymers in confined geometries has been studied in a variety of contexts , including translocation through pores  @xcite , diffusion through networks  @xcite and tubes  @xcite , and the packing of dna within viral capsids  @xcite . for these highly confined polymers",
    "the density profile strongly resembles that of a polymer melt . we might naively expect that since a given section of the polymer interacts primarily with segments that are greatly separated along the chain , each segment may be treated as a sub - chain embedded within a melt",
    "however , this picture is troublesome for dynamical quantities as reptation theory says that the dynamics is governed by the time it takes for a given chain to vacate the tube defined by its immediate neighbors . with a system consisting of a single polymer",
    ", this would imply that the tube occupies the entire box .",
    "therefore , we would be forced to conclude that the chain is completely immobile .",
    "we show here that reptation - like motion is , in fact , the dominant mode of deformation of confined polymers .",
    "in contrast to the situation in melts , however , reptational diffusion is not necessarily initiated by the chain ends , and therefore , can not be always thought of as diffusion along a fixed tube .",
    "polymers confined to thin films have been experimentally shown to have glassy characteristics  @xcite .",
    "while this phenomenon has attracted considerable theoretical attention , it is not well understood  @xcite .",
    "it is also not known whether glassy behavior occurs in other confined geometries . here",
    "we point out a connection between lattice polymer models and kinetically constrained models ( kcm ) with the chain connectivity as the analog of the kinetic constraint .",
    "since many kcms display glassy behavior at high density it is plausible that polymers do as well .    in this paper",
    "we numerically explore the dynamics of confined polymers using a kinetically constrained lattice gas model .",
    "we find that monomer diffusion exhibits power law behavior up to densities very close to the close - packing limit .",
    "however , the overall shape of the chain , as quantified by a tangent - tangent correlation function , shows a broad plateau at high densities .",
    "this apparent paradox is due to the reptation - like nature of the chain movement . because the monomer diffusion is primarily in the direction of the chain backbone , only relatively",
    "small rearrangements of the backbone are required for the monomers to move distances comparable to the system size .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : particle model ]",
    "we define our model and employ monte carlo simulations to show that this model reproduces known results for the dynamic and static properties of unconfined polymers in two dimensions . in section  [ sec : msd ] we show that the individual monomers diffuse with a power law in time behavior up to the close - packing density . in section  [ sec : tantan ] we define the tangent - tangent correlation function and use it to show that the overall shape of the chain is essentially frozen within the time scale required by a monomer to diffuse across distances much larger than the inter - particle seperation . in section  [ sec : tan_dis ] we use a tangent - displacement correlation function to show that the discrepancy between the monomer diffusion and reshaping time scales is due to reptation - like diffusion of the polymer along the chain backbone .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "inspired by the bond fluctuation model  @xcite of polymer dynamics and kinetically constrained models ( kcm )  @xcite such as the kob - andersen model  @xcite , we propose a kcm for the dynamics of a self - avoiding polymer .",
    "the fact that the monomers constitute a polymer requires the connectivity to be preserved .",
    "namely , connected ( unconnected ) monomers must remain connected ( unconnected ) during the polymer motion .",
    "we begin by introducing the model in two dimensions with monomers living on the sites of a square lattice for simplicity .",
    "let us define the polymer connectivity in the following way .",
    "consider a square box of linear size @xmath3 whose center lies on a given monomer .",
    "any other monomer that lies inside or on the boundary of this box is defined as a box - neighbor of the monomer at the center .",
    "clearly , if monomer a is a box - neighbor of monomer b , then monomer b is also a box - neighbor of monomer a. we define two monomers as being connected by a bond if and only if they are box - neighbors .",
    "a monomer with no box neighbors is an isolated polymer of length one .",
    "a monomer with only one box - neighbor is the end - point of a polymer .",
    "a monomer with two box neighbors is a point in the middle of a polymer and a monomer with more than two box neighbors corresponds to a branching point along a polymer .",
    "depending on the initial monomer positions , multiple open or closed chains can be modeled . also by using a d - dimensional hyper - cube instead of a square",
    ", the model can be immediately generalized to higher dimensions .",
    "the dynamics is defined as follows .",
    "a monomer can hop to a nearest neighbor unoccupied site if it has exactly the same box - neighbors before and after the move , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : hard particle example ] .",
    "if no monomer enters the box associated with the moving monomer and no monomer falls out of it during the move , the box will contain the exact same monomers before and after the move .",
    "in other words , all the @xmath4 sites ( @xmath5 in @xmath6 dimensions ) that enter or exit the box as it is moved to the new position , must be unoccupied , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamics ] . in our model as in many kinetically constrained lattice gas models  @xcite , we take the energy to be independent of the configuration , resulting in constant hopping rates .",
    "we assume that the allowed moves take place at unit rate .",
    "so if @xmath7 is defined to assume the value @xmath8 for occupied sites and @xmath9 for empty sites , and @xmath10 , the rate of hopping to the right out of site @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 and by similar expressions for the other directions .",
    "the dynamics forbids monomers that are unconnected from getting too close to each other and therefore ensures self - avoidance .",
    "notice that all the moves are reversible because , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamics ] , any particle that was allowed to hop to a nearest neighbor empty site is allowed to hop back to its original position .",
    "an example of a configuration that satisfies the initial conditions discussed in the text to have a single closed polymer .",
    "this is illustrated explicitly for the particle in red : the box of size @xmath3 ( @xmath13 ) is indicated by the dashed purple square , and the two other particles inside the box are colored in blue .",
    "the same condition holds for all the particles in the system .",
    "all the ( nearest - neighbor ) particle moves allowed by the kinetic constraint are shown for each particle with arrows along the corresponding lattice edge .",
    "one particle in this configuration is temporarily frozen ( circled blue particle ) , and its move is subordinated to the move of one of the two particles in its box of size @xmath3 .",
    "notice that the initial sequence of particles , represented by the wiggly green line , is clearly preserved by the allowed moves . ]     for a model with an @xmath13 box , a monomer can hop in a given direction if the destination site , as well as the ten sites which the old and new box differ by , are empty . ]",
    "we choose the smallest value of @xmath14 for which the model behaves like a polymer while allowing for shorter simulation times .",
    "the @xmath15 case is too restrictive to model different modes of motion .",
    "for example a polymer lying along a straight line is forbidden in the @xmath15 model to undergo one - dimensional translation .",
    "we choose @xmath13 as it is found to adequately describe the free polymer dynamics , as shown by our numerical simulations .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) simulations are used to study the model .",
    "a particularly time - efficient algorithm is achieved by storing two representations of the system at each mc step .",
    "one consists of the position vector of all the monomers , and the other is the configuration matrix of the lattice , with unoccupied sites having value zero and occupied sites value one .",
    "this allows us to chose a monomer at random from the position vector ( rather than a site at random from the whole lattice ) and quickly determine if the monomer is allowed to move in a randomly chosen direction by checking the values of at most eleven elements ( the nearest neighbor site plus the sites by which the old and new box differ ) in the configuration matrix .",
    "note that it is possible to define an alternative model by using a circle of radius @xmath13 instead of a square box of side @xmath16 , which would require the same amount of computational effort because the same number of sites , namely ten sites , would enter or leave the circle drawn around the moving monomer .",
    "the @xmath13 model with a square box proved to give consistent results with the ones available in the literature .",
    "namely , the time - averaged radius of gyration squared of the polymer computed for our model in an infinite box scales as @xmath17 , which is consistent with flory s theoretical result of @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the polymer in unconfined environments is also compatible with the rouse model to a good approximation . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rouse ] , the mean square displacement of the center of mass is diffusive with a diffusion constant that scales as @xmath19 compared to the @xmath20 theoretical value . throughout the paper , time and length",
    "are measured in units of monte - carlo steps and lattice spacings respectively .",
    "only four values of @xmath21 were used for these consistency checks but the fits were very close to the theoretical predictions .",
    "the individual monomer mean square displacement is diffusive at very short times followed by an intermediate - time subdiffusive behavior and a cross - over to a final diffusive behavior at long times as each monomer begins to move with the center of mass .",
    "the subdiffusive msd can be fit with an exponent of @xmath22 over the two - decade interval of @xmath23 which is consistent with the theoretical value of @xmath24 and the bond fluctuation results  @xcite . because of the cross - over to diffusive behavior at long times the curve fits well to a higher exponent of @xmath25 over the longer interval of @xmath26 .",
    "center of mass and individual monomer mean square displacement of a free polymer .",
    "the results are shown for @xmath27 . ]    in the present paper we focus on open and closed polymers without any branching .",
    "the close - packing density of such polymers clearly has an upper limit .",
    "for a single open chain for example , each monomer except for the two end - points has exactly two box - neighbors .",
    "the maximally packed configuration is achieved once the distance along the chain between the consecutive monomers alternates between one and two lattice spacings , and the distance between parallel segments of the folded polymer equals @xmath28 lattice spacings , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fully packed ] .",

    "we denote the ensemble average by @xmath38 .",
    "we prepare random samples with different densities by placing the polymer in a large box and gradually reducing the size of the box .",
    "this is achieved by forbidding the monomers to move to the edges of the box , which corresponds to an infinite repulsive potential at the boundary , and removing one vertical and one horizontal edge line once they have become completely empty . after each shrinking process",
    ", the system is confined to a smaller square box .",
    "shrinking and measurements are done in series . specifically , we start from a very low density of @xmath39 and after each shrinking step we let the system run for @xmath40 monte - carlo steps before trying to shrink further . for measurements involving a long waiting time ( @xmath41 steps ) , i.e. , for densities @xmath42 and @xmath43 , subsequent shrinking steps are preformed starting from the post - measurement configurations . with this method",

    "for very large box sizes ( lowest density ) as well as very small box sizes ( very high densities ) , the saturation plateau is not always reached within the measurement time . however , the maximum value of @xmath52 is still of the same order of the box dimensions .",

    "the only subtlety with closed chains is the existence of a non - trivial background in finite systems .",

    "the dynamics can not change the chirality of the loop in two dimensions .",
    "therefore , all the outer segments of the polymer running parallel to the walls of the box have correlated tangent fields . using an ensemble with random chirality",

    "this approach becomes less and less reliable as the density increases and glassy behavior arises , because each realization is essentially stuck in a small region of configuration space over the measurement time scales .",
