    "globular clusters ( gcs ) in elliptical galaxies have been intensively studied in consideration of explaining the formation of both their host elliptical galaxies and gcs themselves ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "gcs are attractive as tracers of the star formation history of their host galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , because some properties of gc systems are correlated with the properties of their host galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is thought that the formation of gcs is triggered by starburst accompanying gas - rich galaxy merging ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or starburst that might happen with multiple dissipational collapses @xcite .",
    "forming young star clusters are found and they are expected to become star clusters like current old gcs in local galaxy mergers @xcite .",
    "an important aspect of gc systems in elliptical galaxies is a color bimodality ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is also found that red gcs are more centrally concentrated than blue gcs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which could put additional constraints on their formation scenario @xcite . the radial profile of each gc subpopulation is well described by a power - law distribution , especially at the outer radii , and the red gcs have a steeper slope than the blue gcs .",
    "although the origin of this color bimodality is still uncertain , it is probably closely related to the formation history of their host elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "classically , three scenarios have been proposed to explain the color bimodality ; major gas - rich mergers , in situ formation of multiple dissipational collapses , and dissipationless accretion .",
    "an explanation suggested by @xcite is that red gcs are metal - rich clusters which might be formed by gas - rich disk - disk mergers .",
    "therefore , the red gcs might be younger than blue gcs .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite explain that blue gcs might be formed in the first stage of dissipational collapse and red gcs might be formed after the truncation of the blue gc formation .",
    "another explanation given by @xcite includes accretion of blue gcs from small galaxies into the already formed red gcs .",
    "more recently , @xcite demonstrate that the bimodality can be explained in elliptical galaxy formation based on a hierarchical clustering scenario .",
    "on the other hand , recent research suggests that in the late stage of evolution , early - type galaxies might have experienced dry merging where merger progenitors do not have much gas , nor accompany star formation .",
    "the number density evolution of red galaxies has been discussed in observations of combo-17 @xcite and deep2 surveys @xcite , and such studies suggest that the density change can be understood by the dominance of dry merging after z @xmath2 1 ( but see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the evolution of galaxy clustering also implies late effects on the evolution of massive red galaxies from dry merging @xcite .",
    "moreover , the observations show that dry merging does occur @xcite , while the observed features of galaxies are well explained in cosmological simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "recent theoretical studies of dry merger simulations of ellipticals show that merger remnants maintain their properties on the fundamental plane and other scaling relations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the dry merging of binary ellipticals also can explain the formation of boxy - type ellipticals @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that the observed correlation between a spatial distribution of gcs and the total luminosity of ellipticals can be explained by sequential dissipationless major mergers , because the radial density profile of gcs progressively flatten after each major dry merger .",
    "this study raises the important question of whether or not the slopes of the density profiles of red and blue gcs persist after major dry merging .",
    "for example , we now consider that the density profiles of red and blue gcs in progenitor elliptical galaxies are described by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and these profiles in a major dry merger remnant become @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the current observations suggest that @xmath7 .",
    "however , if a dry merger flattens the red gc density profile more than the blue gc density profile , @xmath8 , in the remnant galaxy the difference between @xmath9 and @xmath10 becomes smaller . in this case , the observed difference in the slopes of the density profiles of red and blue gcs in nearby ellipticals can be a valuable diagnostic for the importance of the dry merger in the evolution of ellipticals . to clarify this issue ,",
    "the question becomes how the flattening of gc profiles during dry merging depends on the initial distributions of the gcs .",
    "we use numerical simulations of major dry mergers to study the dependence of gc distributions in merger remnants on the initial distributions in merger progenitors .",
    "then , we can compare @xmath11 and @xmath12 , for different sets of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "since major dry mergers between two equal - mass merger progenitors must leave the most significant effects on merger remnants , compared with minor mergers , we study only equal - mass mergers in this paper . in  2 , we explain details of our dry merger simulations and initial gc distributions .",
    "the changes in gc spatial distributions due to major mergers are shown in  3 .",
    "we discuss the implication of our results in  4 that is followed by conclusion .",
    "our galaxy merger simulations are carried out with a tree n - body code , gcd+ @xcite .",
    "we model a merger progenitor elliptical galaxy which consists of a stellar bulge and a dark matter ( dm ) halo .",
    "the stellar component is assumed to follow the @xcite density profile , @xmath15 we set the total stellar mass @xmath16 .",
    "following @xcite , we use an empirical relation from @xcite , @xmath17 for the hernquist profile , @xmath18 can be described with @xmath19 .",
    "the initial dm halo is assumed to follow the nfw density profile @xcite ; @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a concentration parameter , and @xmath22 is a radius normalized by @xmath23 which is the radius of a sphere whose mean interior density is @xmath24 . the characteristic density @xmath25 is described as @xmath26 the radius of @xmath27 is linked with @xmath28 , the mass within the radius , with @xmath29^{-1/3 } ( 1+z_0)^{-1 }   h^{-1 } { \\rm kpc}.\\ ] ] we assume @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 km s@xmath33 mpc@xmath33 .",
    "the final dm density profile takes into account adiabatic contraction , following the formula suggested by @xcite . following @xcite",
    ", we apply an exponential cut - off for the dark matter density profile at @xmath34 .",
    "we define the total mass of the dm component as the dm mass within @xmath35 , where the density is low enough .",
    "the total mass of the dm component is set to be @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is calculated from the exponentially truncated nfw profile with @xmath38 .",
    "the dm and stellar components are composed of @xmath39 and @xmath40 particles , respectively , so that the particles for the different components have roughly same mass . as a result ,",
    "the particle mass and softening length are @xmath41 and 0.58 kpc , respectively .",
    "we also run one simulation with half number of particles in order to verify convergence of our results .",
    "the velocity dispersions for both dm and stellar components are assumed to be isotropic , @xmath42 , and follow the jeans equation .",
    "then , the velocity dispersion can be written as @xmath43 as shown in @xcite . in our simulations ,",
    "the two merger progenitors have exactly the same distributions of dm and star particles for simplicity .",
    "three different merger orbits are studied in our simulations as given in table 1 . from a fixed initial separation of 400 kpc ,",
    "we have chosen three parabolic orbits @xcite ; ( a ) head - on collision ; ( b ) a close encounter with pericentric distance of the orbit , @xmath44 kpc ; and ( c ) a wider encounter with @xmath45 kpc .",
    "all simulations are stopped after 8 gyrs even though the merger remnants are fully relaxed within 300 kpc within 6 gyrs .    for simplicity , we assume that the gcs are spherically distributed and that the number density follows the following radial profile : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a core radius .",
    "we include the core , because the observed gc density profiles suggest the existence of the core @xcite .",
    "we also examine how the initial core size affects the slope at the outer radii in a dry merger remnant . here , instead of putting additional particles to trace the positions of gcs during the merger , we randomly select particles from dm particles , such that the selected gc particles follow the number density distribution of equation ( [ eq : ngcr ] ) as well as velocity dispersion distribution of equation ( [ eq : veldisp ] ) .",
    "this sampling of gc particles has the advantage that we can simulate various different initial distributions without running a simulation several times , which enables us to study the detailed dependence of the flattening on the initial gc profiles .",
    "after the merger , we analyze the number density profile of the selected gc particles .",
    "we are interested in how final slope of the gc density profile depends on the initial slope .",
    "we fit the profile of the number density at the radii between 10 and 100 kpc by @xmath48 .",
    "this radial region is chosen arbitrarily . however , the important point is that we compare the slope at a fixed radial region throughout the paper .",
    "we consider initial density slopes between @xmath49 and 5 , and the two different core radii of @xmath50 and 5 kpc to see the effect of the initial core size on the final slope .",
    "for each initial gc profile , we sample 10,000 gc particles for each merger progenitor .",
    "figure [ fig : initial_dist ] demonstrates that our sampling well reproduces the input number density profile for gcs even at the outer radii .",
    "it also confirms that the distribution of velocity dispersions for the gcs is consistent with the equilibrium values from equation ( [ eq : veldisp ] ) .",
    "we also test stability of the initial distribution of the selected gc particles by running a simulation of a single isolated galaxy with the sampled gc particles .",
    "after 8 gyrs , the isolated single galaxy maintains the initial distribution of the gcs , as shown in figure [ fig : stability ] .",
    "we present the projected density distribution of the stellar component of a merger remnant in figure [ fig : merger_remnant ] .",
    "we can see that there is a negligible effect from the difference in orbits on the distribution of stars in the merger remnant .",
    "we also fit the final stellar density profiles between @xmath51 and 40 kpc with de vaucouleurs profiles . in figure",
    "[ fig : merger_remnant ] , de vaucouleurs profile describes well the projected distribution of the stellar component in all merger remnants from the three different orbits . the measured effective radius is close to @xmath52 6.2 kpc for all three simulations , which is similar to the results in @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : n_dependence ] we show the final gc number density profile for the different models with @xmath49 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 for simulation b. we first focus on the results for simulation b , and discuss the orbital dependence later . for models of @xmath55 and @xmath54 , the gc profile in the merger remnants is clearly flatter than the initial one .",
    "this result is consistent with what have been found in similar dissipationless galaxy merger simulations @xcite . on the other hand , for the @xmath49 model",
    "there is not much change in the density slope of the gc distribution in a merger remnant .",
    "in addition , comparing models of @xmath55 and @xmath54 , the difference between the initial and the final profile is more significant for the @xmath56 model . hence , flattening of the gc radial profile due to a major dry merger clearly depends on the gc density profile in a progenitor galaxy .",
    "figure [ fig : alpha ] summarizes our main results .",
    "we find that a higher @xmath57 leads to a larger @xmath58 .",
    "in other words , the steeper initial gc profiles result in stronger flattening .",
    "the boundary between a significant and a weak flattening is around @xmath59 . in the next sections ,",
    "we discuss the implication of our results for the evolution in the relative distributions of red and blue gcs during a major dry merger .",
    "first , we briefly examine the importance of the merger orbits and the initial core radii .",
    "we find that the final gc density profile weakly depends on a merger orbit as shown in figure [ fig : orbit_dependence1 ] .",
    "the found maximum difference of @xmath60 is @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "as also highlighted in figure [ fig : orbit_dependence2 ] of the three orbits , the simulation c causes the least flattening in the gc distribution .",
    "the highest angular momentum collision is not efficient in flattening gc distributions .",
    "we also find that the density profile in the outer regions of merger remnants are more sensitive to the merger orbits than that in the inner region . in figure",
    "[ fig : orbit_dependence2 ] , all three merger orbits do not produce any differences in @xmath63 kpc for an initial @xmath64 model .",
    "however , beyond @xmath65 kpc , the small difference of flattening begins to appear .    as a convergence test",
    ", we also run simulation a with a half number of particles , i.e , @xmath66 dm , @xmath67 stellar , and @xmath67 gc particles .",
    "figure [ fig : stability ] demonstrates that the low resolution simulation also provides a stable initial condition .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : convergence ] , the low - resolution simulation leads to the consistent results to the high - resolution simulation .",
    "thus , our results are not affected by the number of particles adopted .      in figure",
    "[ fig : r_c_dependence1 ] , we compare the gc slopes after major dry mergers in the cases where the merger progenitors have the core radii of @xmath68 and 5 kpc .",
    "larger initial core radii result in stronger flattening .",
    "therefore , it is clear that the flattening due to a dry merger depends on the initial core radius .",
    "the size of the initial core radius is a more important factor for the final density slope than the merger orbit , as found in the comparison between figure [ fig : orbit_dependence1 ] and [ fig : r_c_dependence2 ] . in particular",
    ", the size of the initial core radius affects the steepening of the gc density profile differently , depending on @xmath57 .",
    "the difference in @xmath60 between the different initial core radii is more significant for a larger @xmath57 model than for a smaller @xmath57 .",
    "hence it is another interesting issue to see in more detail how the initial core radius affects the flattening .",
    "however , in our method described in  2 , it is difficult to make the initial distribution of gcs with a very small core .",
    "moreover , simulations of a small @xmath47 also need higher spatial resolution than we currently employ , and so we leave this question for future study .",
    "our main result is that steeper initial gc profiles experience stronger flattening as shown in figure [ fig : alpha ] .",
    "@xmath69 is in boundary between strong and weak flattening .",
    "the results imply that if the initial slopes of both red and blue gcs are steeper than @xmath69 , the difference in the slopes between two populations of gcs will become much smaller , independent of merger orbits .",
    "in particular , even only one dry merger can make the slope flatter dramatically .",
    "moreover , it also makes both slopes be around @xmath70 .",
    "for example , if @xmath71 and @xmath72 , figure [ fig : alpha ] suggests that @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the difference in the slope between red and blue gcs becomes significantly small .",
    "therefore , the difference in the slopes of red and blue gcs can be a constraint of the number of major dry mergers .",
    "on the other hand , if the initial gc distribution has a slope shallower than @xmath69 , the slope changes very little , and almost no change in the case of @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , if the initial distributions of red and blue gcs in merger progenitors are steeper than @xmath76 , and the galaxies experienced a number of major dry mergers , it leads the distributions of both red and blue gcs to become close to @xmath77 for both red and blue gcs , and the difference in the slope of spatial distributions becomes difficult to be measured .",
    "it is also worth noting that if the initial core size is larger for blue gcs than for red gcs , but their initial slopes are the same , a major dry merger can make the slope for the blue gcs shallower than for the red gcs , as shown in figure [ fig : r_c_dependence1 ] .",
    "therefore , the final slope is not a simple function of the initial slope .",
    "our results suggest that dry mergers make the slopes of the density profiles for red and blue gcs shallower and similar .",
    "several studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) claim that the various observed properties for ellipticals show a transition around @xmath78 , i.e. @xmath79 . some of these bimodalities have been interpreted in the picture of dry merger hypothesis for the growth of massive ellipticals ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for example , @xcite show that slowly rotating ellipticals might be mainly affected by dry mergers .",
    "the slowly rotating ellipticals are more luminous than @xmath80 , while less luminous ellipticals are fast rotators .",
    "it may indicate that less luminous galaxies have not experienced any major dry mergers .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to examine the observed distributions of red and blue gcs as a function of the stellar mass of ellipticals .",
    "if more luminous galaxies have experienced dry mergers , our results predict that the slopes for red and blue gcs in bright galaxies are shallower and similar .",
    "unfortunately , the current observational samples are not enough to test it statistically . below we provide some discussion based on the current limited measurements .",
    "ngc 1399 is one of ellipticals whose spatial distributions of red and blue gcs are well - observed @xcite . when assuming @xmath81 and @xmath82 for an elliptical galaxy , as used in @xcite , the stellar mass of ngc 1399 is about @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) @xcite",
    ". the derived power - law indices of projected radial density profiles are @xmath85 and @xmath86 for red and blue gcs , respectively @xcite .",
    "if the distributions are spherically symmetric , the three - dimensional radial distributions have power - law slopes of @xmath87 and @xmath88 for red and blue gcs , respectively .",
    "note that the real slope might be slightly steeper , because the distribution of gcs is not infinite .",
    "the slope difference between red and blue gc distributions is @xmath89 while both gc populations show @xmath90 .",
    "in addition to ngc 1399 , ngc 1407 is a brightest group galaxy with @xmath91 , and has a bimodal color distribution of gcs .",
    "@xcite report that the projected slopes of the red and blue gc density profiles are respectively @xmath92 and @xmath93 , i.e. , expected three dimensional slopes of @xmath94 @xmath95 , which are statistically the same as each other",
    ".    on the other hand , ngc 1374 and ngc 1379 are less luminous than ngc 1399 , having @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively .",
    "the red and blue gcs of the two galaxies are studied in @xcite .",
    "the derived projected density distributions of red and blue gcs in ngc 1374 have slopes of 3.2 and 2.3 .",
    "hence , the expected slopes in their three - dimensional density profiles are @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the @xmath100 in ngc 1379 is @xmath101 , and the red and blue gcs have projected power - law slopes of @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively .",
    "the low - luminosity galaxies have a larger difference in the density slopes of the red and blue gcs , and their slopes are steeper than the more luminous galaxies discussed above . combining with our results , these four sample suggests that luminous galaxies , like ngc 1399 and ngc 1407 , may have experienced some dry mergers , while less luminous galaxies , such as ngc 1374 and ngc 1379 , may have not been formed through dry mergers , which is consistent with a scenario that the significance of dry mergers depends on the stellar mass .",
    "however , we also find some giant galaxy that does not follow the above trend .",
    "recently , @xcite measured the density profiles of red and blue gcs for giant ellipticals : m87 and ngc 4552 .",
    "we have fitted the projected density profile in figure 5 of their paper by a power - law profile , and the derived power - law index is 2.4 and 1.4 for red and blue gcs in m87 and 1.8 and 1.2 for red and blue gcs in ngc 4552 , respectively .",
    "although these giant ellipticals have relatively shallower slopes , the difference in slopes of red and blue gcs is significant . according to our result ,",
    "these giant ellipticals are unlikely to have experienced significant dry mergers .",
    "some giants might form without dry mergers , or some other factor , such as a number of minor mergers , might affect the slopes of gcs .    again , so far there are not many studies which derive the density distributions of both red and blue gcs .",
    "this problem limits the application of our results to the current observational data .",
    "however , we expect that future observations will improve the statistics for nearby ellipticals , and our results will add an important framework to interpret the galaxies evolutionary history",
    ". it will be also valuable to compare spatial distributions of blue and red gcs with other expected properties from dry mergers such as surface brightness profile .",
