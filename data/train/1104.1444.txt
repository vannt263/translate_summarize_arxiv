    "the discovery of the accelerating universe ranks as one of science s landmark achievements in the 20th century . surveys exploiting distant type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) as standardizable candles @xcite revealed the presence of a `` dark energy '' that opposes gravity and accelerates the expansion of the universe . when these sn observations are combined with measures of large - scale structure @xcite and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb",

    "* ) , this dark energy emerges as the dominant component of the universe responsible for 7075% of its energy density at the present epoch .    a compelling physical explanation of dark energy remains distant despite a range of possibilities being postulated .",
    "astrophysical measurements of the dark energy s equation - of - state parameter @xmath3 ( the ratio of its pressure to density , @xmath14 ) , and its variation over cosmic history , can help distinguish the possibilities .",
    "the classical `` cosmological constant '' is equivalent to a vacuum energy density with negative pressure , constant in time and space : @xmath11 .",
    "the broad family of `` quintessence '' models , a dynamical form of scalar energy field , mostly predict @xmath15 . a measurement of @xmath16 would be a signal of even more exotic physics .",
    "sne  ia remain , at present , the most direct and mature method of probing this dark energy due to several decades of intensive study and use in cosmology ( see the review of * ? ? ?",
    "thought to be the result of the thermonuclear destruction of an accreting co white dwarf star approaching the chandrasekhar mass limit , they are standardizable candles which explode with nearly the same brightness everywhere in the universe due to the uniformity of the triggering mass and hence the available nuclear fuel .",
    "their cosmological use exploits simple empirical relations between their luminosity and other parameters .",
    "brighter sne  ia have slower , wider light curves @xcite and are typically bluer than their faster , fainter counterparts .",
    "detailed searches for a `` third parameter '' have recently shown that , after applying these first two corrections , brighter sne ia reside in more massive host galaxies @xcite .",
    "the application of relations between sn  ia light - curve - shape , color , and host galaxy properties provides robust distance estimates which allow sne  ia to be used to measure cosmological parameters .",
    "when combined together , recent sn  ia samples provide measures of dark energy generally consistent with a cosmological constant of @xmath11 with statistical uncertainties in @xmath3 of around 57% , and systematic uncertainties of 814% , depending on the method used and assumptions made @xcite .",
    "these sn  ia samples are now sufficiently large that our understanding of systematic uncertainties has a direct impact on our measurement of dark energy @xcite , particularly when combining sne ia from many different surveys at different observatories .",
    "systematic uncertainties which affect the cosmological analysis of sne  ia arise from two broad sources .",
    "the first is experimental systematics ; for example , photometric calibration or survey selection biases . due to the correlations between sn  ia magnitudes that these uncertainties introduce ,",
    "accounting for their effects in the cosmological fits is particularly important .",
    "fortunately this is a tractable problem as the uncertainties are understood in modern sn  ia samples and can be accurately modeled , albeit only after detailed and painstaking work .",
    "the second source of systematics arises from an incomplete understanding of their astrophysics ( e.g. , progenitor configuration , mass transfer and explosion mechanism , etc . ) .",
    "the most pernicious possibilities include evolution in sn  ia properties with redshift tracking changing metallicities / ages of the progenitor stars , and varying dust extinction or color laws ; the correct treatment of sn  ia color  luminosity relationships are particularly uncertain ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the effects of these potential systematics are more nebulous due to the difficulty in modeling sne  ia explosions , but can be investigated empirically .",
    "studies which compare local sn  ia spectra with those at high - redshift find a remarkable degree of similarity across 2780  to 6000 with only small differences in the strengths of some intermediate mass element features @xcite , consistent with a mildly evolving mix in sn  ia demographics with redshift expected from popular sn  ia delay - time distribution models . to date , no definitive evolutionary signature with redshift , which would directly impact a cosmological analysis , has been located .",

    "other papers describe the snls selection biases @xcite , the sn  ia host galaxy information @xcite , and the spectroscopic confirmation and redshift measurements .",
    "this paper performs a cosmological analysis combining the sn - only analysis of with other external , non - sne constraints .",
    "we use 242 well - sampled sne  ia over @xmath17 from the snls together with a large literature sample : 123 sne  ia at low - redshift , 14 sne  ia at @xmath18 from the hubble space telescope , and 93 sne  ia at intermediate redshift from the first year of the sloan digital sky survey - ii sn search .",
    "we include the effects of identified systematic uncertainties directly in our cosmological fitting analysis using an approach outlined in detail in .",
    "this allows our cosmological parameter uncertainties to include systematic as well as statistical uncertainties , with covariances between different sne which influence the cosmological fits accounted for .",
    "examples of effects which cause such covariances include common photometric zeropoints for different sne , or selection effects for sne from the same survey .",
    "appropriate covariance matrices allowing other users of this combined data set to directly include systematic effects in subsequent analyses can be found in .",
    "the advantages of the enlarged snls data set are multiple .",
    "most obviously , this represents a threefold increase in the snls sample size compared to the first year snls cosmological analysis presented in , and as such provides a significant improvement in the statistical precision of the cosmological constraints .",
    "several improvements in survey strategy were made following the first year of snls , including a more regular observing cadence together with longer @xmath19-band exposures , important for the highest redshift events .",
    "moreover , the enlarged data set allows sources of potential astrophysical systematics to be examined by dividing our sn  ia sample according to properties of either the sn ( e.g. , light curve width ) or its environment @xcite .",
    "the increased size of the snls data set has also enabled a better understanding of sn  ia light curve and spectral properties ( particularly at @xmath20@xmath213600  in the rest - frame ) with a corresponding improvement in the methods for estimating their distances , and handling their colors .",
    "the full three years of the snls data also allow an improved photometric calibration of the light curves and a more consistent understanding of the experimental characteristics .    a plan of the paper follows .",

    "@xmath22  [ sec : cosm - sub - sampl ] discusses cosmological fits to various sub - samples of our sn population designed to assess possibilities of astrophysical biases within the sn  ia sample . we summarize and conclude in @xmath22  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we begin by briefly reviewing the sn  ia datasets and the various techniques that we use in the cosmological analysis .",
    "full details of all of our procedures can be found in and , as well as , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "our sn  ia samples are divided into two categories : those discovered and confirmed by the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) , and those taken from the literature which sample different redshift ranges to snls .",
    "the snls uses data taken as part of the five - year canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfht - ls ) .",
    "cfht - ls is an optical imaging survey , the deep component of which conducted repeat imaging of 4 fields every 34 nights in dark time with four filters , allowing the construction of high - quality multi - color sn light curves .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up is used to confirm sn types and measure redshifts , critical in obtaining clean samples of sne  ia as reliable photometric identification techniques have yet to be developed , despite recent progress @xcite .",
    "candidates were prioritized following the procedure outlined in @xcite .",
    "snls benefited from large time allocations on 810 m class telescopes ",
    "@xmath23 hours over five years  including the gemini north and south telescopes , the european southern observatory very large telescopes , and the keck telescopes .",
    "nearly all our sn spectra are published .",
    "all spectra are analyzed and uniformly typed according to the classification schemes of @xcite and .",
    "further information on all 242 snls sne ia that we use , including light curve parameterizations , can be found in .",
    "the snls dataset is complemented with sne ia from the literature over redshift ranges that the snls sample does not cover .",
    "we use 123 sne  ia at low - redshift ( @xmath24 ) from a variety of sources ( primarily * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , 14 sne  ia at @xmath18 from the hst - discovered sample of @xcite , and 93 sne  ia over @xmath25 from the first year of the sloan digital sky survey - ii sn search @xcite .",
    "light curve parameterizations and other data for these events , on the same relative system as that of , can be found in .",
    "we also considered including other sn  ia samples that , at least in part , probe the same redshift range as snls .",
    "however , we do not do this for several reasons ( see also for a discussion of these points ) .",
    "snls is designed to control systematics as much as is possible  a single telescope survey with a well - understood photometric response and calibration , using deep exposures in filters that allow the same rest - frame colors to be measured for most of the redshift range that it probes .",
    "there is also significant published information on the host galaxies @xcite , essential for the cosmological analysis and which is not available for other higher - redshift samples . finally , snls is by far the largest and best observed ( i.e. , highest signal - to - noise for each event ) sn  ia sample over @xmath26 .",
    "adding other sne to this might lead to marginally improved cosmological constraints from a purely statistical perspective , but would certainly lead to a much more complex and uncertain analysis of systematic uncertainties when combining data from many surveys conducted at many telescopes .",
    "all sne are corrected for galactic extinction , malmquist and other selection biases @xcite , and peculiar velocities ( at low redshift ) .",
    "we parameterize the sn  ia light curves for distance estimation using the combined results from updated versions of two independent light curve fitters  sifto @xcite and salt2 .",
    "both techniques provide an estimate of the sn peak rest - frame @xmath27-band apparent magnitude at the epoch of maximum light in that filter , a measure of the sn light curve shape , and an estimate of the sn optical @xmath28 color ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "sifto parameterizes the light curve in terms of stretch ( @xmath30 ) , while salt2 uses a related parameter @xmath31 .",
    "the two light curve fitters are compared in , which also provides details of the techniques used to average them into a single light curve parameterization for subsequent distance estimation .",
    "the distance estimation technique used , based on the combined sifto / salt2 light curve parameters , is described in @xmath22  [ sec : cosm - fits - method ] .",
    "other light curve fitting and distance estimation techniques are available .",
    "in particular , the mlcs2k2 fitter @xcite has been widely used in previous sn ia analyses ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , and the use of mlcs2k2 versus salt2 has led to significantly different cosmological parameters in some cases .",
    "the two techniques are mathematically equivalent ( to first order  see section 4.2.3 in ) , and many of the apparent differences can instead be traced back to the training data and priors on sn color .",
    "we do not use mlcs2k2 in the snls3 analysis for several practical reasons , discussed at length in and , and which we summarize here .",
    "there are apparent calibration problems with observer @xmath32-band sn ia data ( which we do not use anywhere in our analysis ) which mlcs2k2 is reliant upon for its distance - estimation training .",
    "these include :    * observer - frame @xmath32-band sn ia data show more scatter around individual sn ia light curve fits than can be accounted for by the published observational uncertainites .",
    "this large intrinsic scatter is not seen in snls and sdss - sn sn observations transformed into rest - frame @xmath32-band . * in @xmath33 versus @xmath28 color - color space , the sne with observer - frame @xmath32-band data show a systematic offset compared with the other sn samples ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : colcol ] ) , * there is significant tension between sne with observer - frame @xmath32-band data , and those without , in the cosmological fits .",
    "this tension disappears if this @xmath32-band data is removed from the light curve fits for the low-@xmath19 sne .",
    "a sample of low-@xmath19 sne from the carnegie supernova project @xcite with observer - frame @xmath34 data show none of these three problems above .",
    "that is , the properties of the low-@xmath19 sn ia @xmath32-band data are inconsistent with snls at @xmath35 , with sdss - sn at @xmath36 , and with the csp sample at @xmath37 .",
    "various possibilities for the origin of this @xmath32-band anomaly are outlined in section 2.6 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "for this to be an evolutionary or astrophysical effect , any evolution must be astonishingly sudden ( i.e. , turning on at @xmath36 and then not evolving any further out to @xmath38 )  yet somehow only effect one of the two sources of low-@xmath19 data ( those with @xmath32 , instead of @xmath34 , data ) .",
    "it must also somehow not manifest itself in maximum - light spectral comparisons between low-@xmath19 and high-@xmath19 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note that the small , and not very significant , evolution that is seen in @xcite is in the opposite sense to that implied by the @xmath32-band photometry problem .",
    "the overwhelming likelihood is that this is a problem with the notoriously difficult calibration of the observer - frame @xmath32-band data  there is no evidence that it is an astrophysical effect , and significant evidence that it is not .",
    "note that an mlcs2k2 trained without the @xmath32-band data severely impacts the science that can be done  as a distance estimator , mlcs2k2 requires @xmath39 sne ia for the training , and therefore can not be supplemented with snls / sdss sn data sampling the rest - frame @xmath32-band as is the case with salt2 and sifto .",
    "even with a version of mlcs2k2 not trained using the current @xmath32-band data , additional problems remain .",
    "these are discussed at length in in their section 4.2 . in that analysis",
    ", the authors noted that mlsc2k2 requires the use of priors that color variation in sne ia is caused by dust extinction , which can introduce additional biases into the estimated distances  there is no evidence that color variation in sne ia is caused purely by dust extinction , and significant evidence that intrinsic sn properties make the story more complex .",
    "additionally , a @xcite - like color - variation law for the sne is assumed , which again is not supported by the data .",
    "disentangling the effect of intrinsic color variation from color variation due to dust would require additional parameters in mlcs2k2 , salt2 or sifto which currently do not exist  at present no light curve fitter correctly disentangles the two effects .",
    "in particular , a weakness of the approach used in this paper ( see @xmath22  [ sec : cosm - fits - method ] ) is to conflate intrinsic and dust effects into a single parameter , @xmath12 , during the distance estimation .",
    "however , the tests that we are able to perform  for example examining the evolution in this @xmath12 parameter with redshift ( figure 14 in c10 )  show no evidence for any significant systematic effects in the salt2/sifto distance estimation method .",
    "the case of maximal evolution in @xmath12 supported by our data are included in our error budget ( see @xmath22  [ sec : syst - uncert ] ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "the differences reported in @xcite are now understood and can be traced back to a combination of the @xmath32-band calibration and color priors  and should not , therefore , be considered as systematics . these above issues were a significant motivation for us to develop two independent light curve fitters within snls that differ conceptually in the way that color is handled .",
    "differences in the light curves fits from these two codes are carried through as an uncertainty in our analysis ",
    "so our final quoted errors on the cosmological parameters fully include this effect .",
    "we apply various selection cuts to the sn ia samples designed to ensure an adequate wavelength and phase coverage in the light curve fits .",
    "these are described in detail in and , and essentially ensure that an accurate light curve width , rest - frame color , and peak rest - frame @xmath27-magnitude can be measured . additionally , each sn must be spectroscopically confirmed ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion of our spectroscopic classification criteria ) , have a minimum cmb - frame redshift ( @xmath40 ) of 0.010 ( after peculiar velocity correction ) , be spectroscopically normal , have a galactic extinction of @xmath41 , and be of normal stretch ( @xmath42 ) and color ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "we also remove 6 outliers on the hubble diagram ",
    "see for details .",
    "recent analyses have found correlations between sn  ia luminosity and their host galaxies , even after the well - known fainter  faster and fainter ",
    "redder corrections have been made @xcite . at the present time , it is not clear from an astrophysical perspective which host galaxy parameter is the optimal choice to use ( as the third parameter ) in the analysis .",
    "the observed effects could be due to progenitor metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , progenitor age ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or possibly some other parameter .",
    "empirically , trends in sn  ia luminosity are seen with a variety of derived host galaxy parameters , including stellar mass ( @xmath44 ) , star formation rate ( sfr ) , and inferred stellar age .",
    "however many of these parameters are strongly correlated when derived from broad - band photometry available for the host galaxies .",
    "we use the host galaxy stellar mass as the third variable in our cosmological fitting .",
    "this has the advantage of being easiest to determine from sometimes limited host data , and shows significant trends with the sn  ia luminosities .",
    "we derive the host information by following the method in @xcite , fitting the broad - band spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the host galaxies using simple galaxy population synthesis models .",
    "the host galaxy information can be found in and for all the sne used in our analysis .",
    "we consider a variety of systematic uncertainties in our analysis , discussed in detail in .",
    "details of the construction of the covariance matrices that encode this information can be found in that paper . for each systematic",
    "we estimate its size and adjust that variable in the light curve fits .",
    "all the light curves are refit , including a re - training of the light curve model where required , and the derived light curve parameters ( @xmath45 , @xmath30 , @xmath29 ) compared for each sn with and without the inclusion of the systematic .",
    "these differences are converted into a covariance matrix following .",
    "having summarized the main features of our dataset , we now turn to the cosmological analysis .",

    "the third approach is the ` cosmomc ` program @xcite , which uses a markov - chain monte carlo technique to explore cosmological parameter space .",
    "we use this approach for our main cosmological results .",
    "we made the following modifications to the may 2010 version of ` cosmomc ` package to handle snls3 data : first , we properly marginalize over the sn nuisance parameters @xmath56 and @xmath12 rather than holding them fixed ; second , we keep track of the difference between heliocentric and cmb frame redshifts , which enter into the luminosity distance differently , important for some of the lowest-@xmath19 sne ; third , we have added the ability to fit for the host - dependence of sn  ia absolute luminosities as described in @xcite .",

    "* and this paper ) and intrinsic variation in sn color that does not correlate with sn light curve shape ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and which may depend on variables such as explosion asymmetry or observational viewing angle @xcite .",
    "recent work has shown that sn color is also correlated with sn  ia spectral features , with sne possessing faster ejecta velocities having redder colors at fixed @xmath63 ( or equivalently brighter @xmath63 at fixed color ) in samples with very red sne excluded @xcite .    under the assumption that any intrinsic sn  ia color ",
    "luminosity relation has a smaller effective @xmath12 than that from dust ( as seems likely given we observe @xmath179 ) , our results are qualitatively consistent with a scenario in which dust extinction modifies this intrinsic color  luminosity relation .",
    "the lowest @xmath44  host galaxies are those with the largest specific sfrs , and therefore the largest dust content .",
    "we would therefore expect to find sne  ia with a larger effective @xmath12 ( i.e. , closer to the true dust value ) in lower @xmath44  hosts , which is consistent with our observations . in more massive , passive host galaxies , we are likely observing a @xmath12 closer to the intrinsic value .",
    "in this paper we have presented the cosmological results for the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) three - year sn  ia sample , combined with other constraints from the literature .",
    "our sn  ia sample contains 472 sne , including 242 from snls , 123 at low redshift , 93 from sdss - sn , and 14 from hst .",
    "we have performed analyses investigating the cosmological parameters @xmath52 , @xmath55 , and the dark energy equation - of - state parameter @xmath3 .",
    "a key aspect of our analysis is the inclusion of all identified sn  ia systematic uncertainties directly in our cosmological fits .",
    "the inclusion of these systematic uncertainties has two key effects .",
    "foremost , the uncertainties that we quote on the cosmological parameters reflect the systematic component .",
    "second , correlations in brightness , stretch and color between different sne due to their being affected by the same systematic are accounted for during the cosmological fitting stage .",
    "we also correct for recently identified trends between sn  ia brightness and host galaxy stellar mass , and account for the effect of systematic differences from the use of two independent sn  ia light curve fitters .",
    "1 .   for simple cosmological fits assuming a flat universe and constant @xmath3 , combining the snls3 sample with bao observations and the wmap7 cmb `` shift '' parameters gives @xmath180 and @xmath103 , where the error is statistical only .",
    "when we include all identified sn  ia systematics in the fits , we find @xmath181 and @xmath104 .",
    "2 .   in terms of the contribution towards the uncertainty in measuring @xmath3 in the above fits , our systematic and statistical uncertainties are approximately equal ( 5.5% and 5.2%",
    "respectively ) . however , the systematic uncertainty error budget is dominated by the photometric calibration of the sn fluxes , rather than uncertainties related to the astrophysics of the sne themselves . neglecting calibration uncertainties , likely",
    "to be dramatically reduced in the future , gives a systematic uncertainty of @xmath4% .",
    "3 .   when including the shoes prior on @xmath0 , together with the full wmap7 power spectrum and the power spectrum of lrgs in sdss dr7 , we find @xmath1 and @xmath2 using the ` cosmomc ` fitter , a 6.5% measure of @xmath3 . when we relax the assumption of a flat universe , we find @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "these include all sn systematic uncertainties .",
    "we consider a simple parameterization of the time variation of @xmath3 as @xmath8 . assuming a flat universe we find @xmath182 , @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "this includes wmap7 , sdss - dr7 , and the shoes @xmath0 prior as external constraints .",
    "our results are equivalent to a detf figure - of - merit of @xmath185 . 5 .",
    "we investigate astrophysical systematics in our sn  ia sample by breaking it into sub - samples based on sn light curve and host galaxy parameters .",
    "cosmologies determined from these sn sub - samples are fully consistent .",
    "however , we find significant evidence ( @xmath186 ) for a different @xmath12 between low and high stellar mass host galaxies ( as well as a different @xmath63 , which we already account for ) . the effect of this varying @xmath12 on the cosmology lies well within the current systematic uncertainty assigned to host - galaxy - dependent corrections , but our analysis emphasizes the critical need to make host galaxy related corrections when determining the cosmological parameters .",
    "when the snls3 sample is combined with measurements of large scale structure , observations of the cmb , and a prior on @xmath0 , the constraints on dark energy presented here are the tightest available , and directly include all identified sn  ia systematic uncertainties in the analysis .",
    "all our results are consistent with a flat , @xmath11 universe .",
    "the primary contributor to the systematic error budget is the calibration of the sn  ia fluxes , both placing them on a consistent system between different sn  ia surveys , and then interpreting that system when fitting the sn light curves .",
    "the magnitude of the identified astrophysical systematics is significantly smaller than calibration related uncertainties .",
    "those that have been uncovered in the sn ia population can be adequately controlled using empirical corrections based on the properties of the sn ia host galaxies .",
    "the implication is that , if the calibration - related systematics can be reduced , sne  ia are a long way from being systematics limited . in part ,",
    "the calibration - related systematics arise from the need to calibrate the @xmath187 snls and sdss filter sets to the @xmath188 system used for the majority of the low - redshift sn  ia data .",
    "this situation is set to improve considerably as improved low redshift sn  ia samples become available ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these new samples will be directly calibrated to the snls system ( or vice - versa ) and will eliminate , or at least substantially reduce , the main systematic uncertainties , allowing the full potential of the snls sample to be unlocked .",
