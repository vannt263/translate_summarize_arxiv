    "since the suggestion of @xmath0 suppression as a possible signature of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formed in relativistic heavy ion collisions  @xcite , extensive studies have been carried out both theoretically and experimentally not only on charmonia production but also on bottomonia production in these collisions @xcite . compared to @xmath0 production ,",
    "the ground state bottomonium is , however , a more promising probe to the hot dense matter created in relativistic heavy ion collisions because of the relatively small contributions from its excited states and from regeneration in the qgp @xcite .",

    "we found that the contribution from regeneration was very small for bottomonia as expected and the modification of the thermal properties of bottomonia in hot dense matter was helpful in describing the experimental data .",
