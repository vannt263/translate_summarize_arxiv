    "with numerous high precision telescopes and satellite missions operating already or becoming operational within the next decade einstein s theory of general relativity will be tested with increasing accuracy , in particular , in the strong gravity regime ( see , e.g. , the reviews  @xcite ) .    from a theoretical point of view general relativity",
    "is expected to be superseded by a new theory of gravity , which on the one hand will not be suffering from those pathological singularities present in many solutions of general relativity ( gr ) , and , on the other hand , will be compatible with quantum theory .",
    "string theory , as a leading candidate for a unified theory of the fundamental interactions and a quantum theory of gravity , for instance , predicts the presence of higher curvature corrections to einstein gravity as well as the existence of further fields .",
    "the low energy effective theory deriving from heterotic string theory contains as basic ingredients a gauss - bonnet term and a dilaton field @xcite .",
    "the effects of the presence of such terms on the properties of compact astrophysical objects can be strong , as has been shown for black holes @xcite and neutron stars @xcite , which have been studied in a truncated version of this theory , named dilatonic einstein - gauss - bonnet ( egbd ) theory .",
    "moreover , egbd theory allows for wormhole solutions without the necessity of introducing exotic fields @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we focus on rapidly rotating compact objects in egbd theory and compare their properties with those of their einstein gravity counterparts . in particular , we here determine the quadrupole moments of rapidly rotating black holes and neutron stars .",
    "black holes in egbd theory can slightly exceed the kerr bound , @xmath2 , given by the scale invariant ratio of the angular momentum @xmath3 and the square of the mass @xmath4 in appropriate units @xcite .",
    "the innermost - stable - circular - orbits ( iscos ) can differ from the respective kerr values by a few percent in the case of slow rotation @xcite and up to 10% for rapid rotation @xcite .",
    "similarly , the orbital frequencies exhibit the largest deviations from the kerr frequencies for rapid rotation , which can be as large as 60%",
    ". such large effects might be observable for astrophysical black holes .    for neutron stars , on the other hand",
    ", recent calculations showed , that for slowly rotating neutron stars universal relations hold between the scaled moment of inertia @xmath0 , the love number , and the scaled quadrupole moment @xmath1 in einstein gravity @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation was generalized to the case of rapidly rotating neutron stars , where for fixed rotation parameter @xmath5 again only little dependence on the equation of state was seen @xcite , after appropriately scaled quantities were considered @xcite .    in the following we briefly recall egbd theory and obtain the quadrupole moment for compact objects in this theory .",
    "we then discuss the quadrupole moments of rapidly rotating black holes and show that they may deviate from their kerr counterparts by 20% and more .",
    "subsequently , we present rapidly rotating neutron stars in egbd theory and discuss their @xmath0-@xmath1 relation .",
    "we conclude , that just like in einstein gravity the properly scaled dimensionless quantities exhibit little dependence on the equation of state .",
    "as motivated by the low - energy heterotic string theory @xcite we consider the following low - energy effective action @xcite @xmath6 , \\label{act}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is newton s constant , @xmath8 is the speed of light , @xmath9 denotes the dilaton field with coupling constant @xmath10 , @xmath11 is a numerical coefficient given in terms of the regge slope parameter , and @xmath12 is the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term .",
    "we have chosen the dilaton coupling constant according to its string theory value , @xmath13 .    to construct rotating compact objects we employ the lewis - papapetrou line element @xcite for a stationary , axially symmetric spacetime with two killing vector fields @xmath14 , @xmath15 . in terms of the spherical",
    "coordinates @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the isotropic metric reads @xcite @xmath18          + r^2 \\sin^2\\theta            \\left(d\\varphi-\\omega c dt\\right)^2\\right ) , \\label{metric}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are functions of @xmath16 and @xmath17 only .    in the asymptotic region",
    "the metric and dilaton functions possess the expansion @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a legendre polynomial , @xmath4 is the mass , @xmath3 is the angular momentum , @xmath25 is the dilaton charge , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are further expansion constants .    to extract the quadrupole moment of the compact solutions , we follow geroch and hansen @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and obtain @xmath28 m^3 . \\label{q}\\ ] ] we note , that there is no explicit contribution from the gb term , since this term decays sufficiently fast .",
    "the dilaton field enters only via the coulomb - like term @xmath29 , which coincides with the analogous term in einstein - maxwell theory to lowest order in the expansion .",
    "thus the expressions for the quadrupole moment are completely analogous . in the vacuum limit , when the dilaton charge vanishes , the quadrupole moment @xmath30 reduces to the expression in @xcite ( up to an overall sign ) , with @xmath31 . on the other hand , in the static limit",
    "the solution is spherically symmetric . in this case @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and the quadrupole moment vanishes .",
    "the domain of existence of the egbd black hole solutions i.e. , @xmath34 . ]",
    "resides within the boundaries formed by ( i ) the kerr black holes , ( ii ) the critical black holes , where a radicant vanishes @xcite , and ( iii ) the set of extremal black holes with @xmath35 , which have temperature @xmath36 , a regular metric , but a dilaton field that diverges on the horizon at the poles @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a the shaded area represents the domain of existence , with ( i ) the lower boundary , ( ii ) the upper boundary , and ( iii ) the right lower boundary in the inset .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a we present the scaled quadrupole moment @xmath37 of the rotating black hole solutions versus the scaled angular momentum @xmath5 for several values of the dimensionless horizon angular velocity @xmath38 .",
    "the curves are obtained , by fixing the value of @xmath39 and the value of @xmath40 and by varying the size of the black hole .    for fixed @xmath40",
    "the range of the scaled area @xmath41 for egbd black holes is largest in the static case and decreases to zero for the maximal value of @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "this is reflected in the range of the scaled quadrupole moment @xmath43 , which is likewise largest in the limit of slow rotation , and decreases with increasing @xmath42 .",
    "thus for slow rotation deviations from the kerr value of up to 20% and more are seen .",
    "moreover , the solutions with @xmath35 , not present in general relativity ( gr ) , always have @xmath44 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b we exhibit the scaled moment of inertia @xmath45 versus the scaled quadrupole moment @xmath43 for fixed values of @xmath42 . for @xmath46 the families of solutions with fixed @xmath42 start at the respective kerr values , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , indicated by the dots on the axis .",
    "they end at the boundary ( ii ) given by the critical solutions and represented by the dotted curve .",
    "the inset again shows the region @xmath35 .",
    "the figure also contains the perturbative results derived in @xcite for small @xmath40 and small @xmath42 .",
    "clearly , the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation for black holes depends on the value of the scaled angular momentum @xmath42 .",
    "however , for black holes there is no dependence of this relation on the coupling parameter @xmath40 .",
    "this is a consequence of the invariance of @xmath49 , @xmath43 , @xmath42 and the egbd equations under the scaling transformation @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "the absolute value of the scaled dilaton charge @xmath53 decreases monotonically with decreasing scaled quadrupole moment @xmath1 . in the limit @xmath54 the scaled dilaton charge @xmath53 vanishes .",
    "therefore the scaled moment of inertia @xmath49 approaches @xmath55 in this limit .",
    "its dependence on the value of the scaled angular momentum @xmath42 is only weak .",
    "rapidly rotating neutron stars have been studied extensively in gr ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . here",
    "we address rapidly rotating neutron stars in egbd theory @xcite . considering rigid rotation",
    ", the four - velocity has the form @xmath56 with angular velocity @xmath57 .",
    "the normalization condition @xmath58 then yields @xmath59 the differential equations for the pressure @xmath60 and the energy density @xmath61 are obtained from the constraints @xmath62 , @xmath63    these equations have to be supplemented by an equation of state ( eos ) , @xmath64 ( or @xmath65 ) . for a polytropic eos , @xmath66 , with central pressure @xmath67 and central density @xmath68 .",
    "substitution in eq .",
    "( [ dpres ] ) yields @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is an integration constant , which we express as @xmath71 to obtain the more convenient expression @xmath72 the boundary of the star is defined by @xmath73 , implying @xmath74 and consequently @xmath75 . outside the star @xmath76 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a we exhibit the quadrupole moment @xmath30 in units of @xmath77 versus the angular velocity @xmath57 in hz for a family of neutron stars for a fixed scaled angular momentum of @xmath78 , the gb couplings @xmath79 , 1 and 2 , and two well - known equations of state .",
    "the first eos corresponds to a polytropic eos with @xmath80 , taken from @xcite and denoted by di - ii , which is widely used in neutron star physics and also employed for neutron stars in scalar - tensor theory @xcite , while the second eos corresponds to an approximation to the fps eos @xcite .",
    "clearly , the two equations of state give rise to rather different quadrupole moments , whereas the dependence on the gb coupling @xmath40 is only moderate , while increasing with increasing @xmath40 .    to address the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation for neutron stars we exhibit in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b @xmath49 versus @xmath43 for a fixed value of the scaled angular momentum , @xmath78 .",
    "again , we employ the polytropic eos di - ii @xcite and the analytical fit to the fps eos @xcite .",
    "comparison shows , that for a given value of @xmath40 and a given value of @xmath42 the dependence on the eos is only weak , but increasing with increasing @xmath40 .",
    "moreover , the @xmath40-dependence is the stronger the smaller @xmath42 .",
    "we did not go beyond @xmath81 , since the strongest current observational upper bound on @xmath40 , obtained from low - mass x - ray binaries , is slightly less than this value ( in the units employed ) @xcite .",
    "following the procedure of geroch and hansen @xcite we have derived the spin induced quadrupole moment for rapidly rotating compact objects in egbd theory .",
    "the scaled quadrupole moment of black holes can deviate by 20% and more from the corresponding kerr value for a given value of the scaled angular momentum @xmath42 .",
    "their @xmath0-@xmath1 relation has no deplicit dependence on the gauss - bonnet coupling @xmath40 .    for neutron stars the presence of the matter breaks the scale invariance of the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation .",
    "we now observe a dependence on @xmath40 , which is however weak in its allowed range . while the unscaled quantities depend quite significantly on the equation of state , the scaled quantities satisfy to good approximation universal relations , which depend only on the scaled angular momentum @xmath42 , in egbd theory like in gr .",
    "we are currently extending the calculations to quark stars , to see whether the universal relations hold also in this case @xcite for egbd theory . unlike the case of chern - simons theory also studied in @xcite , however , the @xmath0-@xmath1 relations do not differ significantly for egbd theory and gr . here",
    "other observables including iscos and orbital periods seem more promising handles to test the viability of egbd theory .",
    "finally , another type of compact object can be obtained in egbd theory , namely wormholes , which may possibly correspond to black hole foils @xcite .",
    "we expect that the static egbd wormholes @xcite can be generalized to rapidly rotating wormholes , while retaining their linear stability with respect to changes of the size of their throat",
    ". it will be interesting to extract their quadrupole moments and compare them with the quadrupole moments of the egbd black holes .",
