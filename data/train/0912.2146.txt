    "the topic of the gravito - electromagnetic analogies has a long story , with different analogies being unveiled throughout the years .",

    "the linearized einstein equations ( see e.g. @xcite ) , in the harmonic gauge @xmath0 , take the form @xmath1 , similar to maxwell equations in the lorentz gauge : @xmath2 .",

    "the time components of these equations may be cast in a maxwell - like form , e.g. eqs ( 16)-(22 ) of @xcite .",
    "furthermore ( on certain special conditions , see section [ sec : linearized - gravity ] ) geodesics , precession and forces on gyroscopes are described in terms of these fields in a form similar to their electromagnetic counterparts , e.g. @xcite , @xcite .",
    "such analogy may actually be cast in an exact form using the 3 + 1 splitting of spacetime ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these are analogies comparing physical quantities ( electromagnetic forces ) from one theory with inertial gravitational forces ( i.e. fictitious forces , that can be gauged away by moving to a freely falling frame , due to the equivalence principle ) ; it is clear that ( non - spinning ) test particles in a gravitational field move with zero acceleration @xmath5 ; and that the spin 4-vector of a gyroscope undergoes fermi - walker transport @xmath6 , with no real torques applied on it . in this sense",
    "the gravito - electromagnetic fields are pure coordinate artifacts , attached to the observer s frame .    however , these approaches describe also ( not through the `` gravito - electromagnetic '' fields themselves , but through their derivatives ; and , again , under very special conditions ) tidal effects , like the force applied on a gyroscope . and these are covariant effects , implying physical gravitational forces .",

    "like ( 16)-(22 ) of @xcite have a physical content ) . for that we will make use of the tidal tensor formalism introduced in @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this formalism is that , by contrast with the approaches mentioned above , it is based on quantities which can be covariantly defined in both theories  tidal forces ( the only physical forces present in gravity )  which allows for a more transparent comparison between the electromagnetic ( em ) and gravitational ( gr ) interactions .",
