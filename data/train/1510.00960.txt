    "the observation of the sky with space - born instruments , equipped with detectors working at those electro - magnetic frequencies that can not be accessed from the ground , revealed the existence of several classes of high energy radiation sources . with",
    "their location in distant galaxies , active galactic nuclei ( agns , in brief ) turned out to be the most powerful non transient sources of such radiation . although agns appear with many different properties , they share an extreme intrinsic luminosity , ranging between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , comparable to or greater than the energy output of large galaxies , but released from a region that is smaller than 1  pc in radius . to explain this property we assume that large amounts of matter , in the order of some solar masses per year , are conveyed to the nuclear regions of active galaxies , where they are accreted by a super massive black hole ( smbh ) .",
    "it is now well established that smbhs with masses between @xmath7 and some @xmath8 reside in the nuclei of every massive galaxy ( ferrarese & merrit , 2000 ; shankar , 2009 ) .",
    "in addition , we know that accretion of fuel into their gravitational field leads to the conversion of gravitational binding energy into radiation with very high efficiency ( blandford & znajek , 1977 ; shields , 1978 ) .    due to the presence of relativistic plasmas and strong magnetic fields in the vicinity of the black hole s accretion flow , the spectrum of the emitted radiation results from a combination of thermal and non - thermal components that cover several orders of magnitude in frequency , sometimes extending from radio wavelengths all the way up to @xmath0-ray energies . the fermi large area telescope ( fermi - lat ; see atwood et al . , 2009 )",
    "gave new life to the study of the @xmath0-ray sky , producing , after 4 years of scientific observations , a map of @xmath0-ray detections with unprecedented resolution and sensitivity in the energy range between 100  mev and 300  gev ( acero et al .",
    "thanks to this result , a large number of @xmath0-ray sources can now be associated with lower energy counterparts . in the extra - galactic environment , it turned out that the most commonly detected objects are agns belonging to the blazar class",
    ". blazars are extremely variable , highly polarized , radio - loud sources , dominated by power - law continuum spectra of type @xmath9 , with a typical radio spectral slope @xmath10 .",
    "their properties are the consequence of the relativistic beaming of the synchrotron radiation produced by a jet that is collimated and accelerated close to our line of sight ( blandford & knigl , 1979 ) .",
    "they are classically separated into bl lac objects ( bll ) , whose optical spectra show a nearly featureless power - law continuum , and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) , which , instead , are characterized by strong emission lines .",
    "in addition to the blazars that dominate the extra - galactic @xmath0-ray population , other types of agns , together with a large number of sources without a firm classification , are detected as well . in this contribution",
    "we describe our investigation on the nature of @xmath0-ray agns of undetermined type , through the observation of their optical spectra .",
    "we focus our attention on targets whose spectral energy distributions ( sed ) are consistent with those of blazars , although they still lack firm spectroscopic classification , and they are therefore called blazar candidates of undetermined type ( bcu in 3fgl terminology , acero et al . , 2015 ) . in this report",
    ", we discuss the spectral classification of some bcus , with respect to the associated seds , rather than giving a full list of observations . in the following sections , we describe the techniques used in the attempt to identify the low energy counterparts of the @xmath0-ray sources , the details of how we collected the optical spectra and their classification criteria .",
    "finally , we draw a sketch of the @xmath0-ray emission in the different classes of objects that we observe , compared with the multiple wavelength properties of their seds .",
    "at the energies of @xmath0-ray photons it is not possible to focus radiation through reflecting or refracting optical devices .",
    "the fermi - lat , instead , measures the production of @xmath11 pairs , through the conversion of photons in the detector ( atwood et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "the pair properties are used to reconstruct the energy and the direction of the incoming photon .",
    "the precision that can be achieved in the measurement depends mainly on the incoming photon incidence angle and on its energy .",
    "it can be roughly estimated that , for a photon of energy between 10 gev and 100 gev , hitting the detector at normal incidence , the 95% containment angle is approximately 0.5@xmath12(ackermann et al . , 2012 ) .",
    "although the detection of multiple photons from a source can improve the performances , the contribution of nearby sources and background noise , combined with less than optimal detection conditions , results in a still significant uncertainty in the localization of the sources .",
    "thus , in general , the task to associate a low energy counterpart to @xmath0-ray sources is not trivial .    in the case of agns",
    ", the expected broad band emission provides a reliable way to better constrain the source position .",
    "since @xmath0-rays from agns arise from inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of low energy seed photons by relativistic plasma particles confined in strong magnetic fields , the @xmath0-ray production occurs together with synchrotron radiation .",
    "if the energy distribution of the plasma particles is extended enough to support significant @xmath0-ray emission , we expect that powerful synchrotron radiation is produced at radio and x - ray energies , as well .",
    "taking advantage from the angular resolution of instruments working at these frequencies , which can measure the position of radiation sources down to a few arcseconds , we are able to identify candidate counterparts to @xmath0-ray emission by looking for coincident x - ray and radio sources within the @xmath0-ray detection uncertainty radius ( ackermann et al . , 2011 ; gasparrini et al .",
    "furthermore , the existence of a connection between @xmath0-ray emission and lower frequency radiation implies that large flux variations , that characterize agns particularly in the high energies , can be observed in different frequencies .",
    "thanks to the monitoring strategy of fermi - lat observations , covering the entire sky approximately every 3  hr , the detection of important flaring activity can be matched with follow - up observations that are able to identify the possible correlated variations of the source in other frequencies .",
    "once the source position is determined by either of the techniques down to a few arcseconds , it is possible to search for the optical counterpart and to obtain its spectrum .",
    "the latest catalog of fermi - lat detected agns ( 3lac , see ackermann et al . , 2015 )",
    "includes blazars , radio galaxies , steep spectrum radio quasars ( ssrqs ) , seyfert galaxies and narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "in addition to the classified sources , however , a number of undetermined type objects , generally called agns or bcus , still exists . focusing our attention on these unclassified objects",
    ", we carried out a spectroscopic study that combines publicly available spectra , like those extracted from the latest data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss - dr 12 ; alam et al . , 2015 ) and of the 6df galaxy redshift survey ( 6dfgrs - dr 3 ; jones et al . , 2004 , 2009 ) , together with new observations performed at the 1.22 m and the 1.82 m telescopes of the asiago astrophysical observatory ( ciroi et al . , 2014 ) .",
    "1 illustrates examples of spectra obtained in this study .",
    "the main purpose of this optical spectroscopic analysis is to identify the agn class for the source associated to the @xmath0-ray emission and to determine its redshift , through the identification of known emission or absorption lines . in general",
    ", the detection of emission lines ensures the most reliable measurement of the source redshift , because they are easier to detect and they are originated very close to central smbh .",
    "absorption lines , on the contrary , are produced either in the host galaxy or along the light path towards us .",
    "they are much more difficult to detect and can only be seen if the agn is not overwhelmingly dominant .",
    "it follows that the presence of emission lines characterizes agns with radiatively efficient accretion activity , therefore surrounded by nuclear and circum - nuclear regions of ionized gas , like quasars and seyfert galaxies .",
    "blls , on the contrary , just give raise to a featureless power - law continuum , where some absorption features can show up , if the jet power is relatively low with respect to the host galaxy luminosity , or when some intervening medium happens to lie along the line of sight to the source .",
    ".list of sources included in this report .",
    "the table provides the @xmath0-ray source identifier , the associated counterpart name , the counterpart position ( j2000.0 ) , the object redshift and its spectroscopic classification . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath13 residuals of ssc models are computed without taking into account the thermal excess data points .",
    "in this study we presented the optical spectra of six targets that have been associated to @xmath0-ray sources of still undetermined type in 3lac . in some cases",
    ", the spectra of this type of objects can still be obtained from large spectroscopic surveys , such as the sdss , above all , but , in others , we need specifically planned observations .",
    "the increase of sensitivity and resolution achieved by the fermi - lat at @xmath0-ray energies is now providing better opportunities to identify candidate counterparts to extra - galactic @xmath0-ray emission and , therefore , to improve the selection of targets .    with an improved ability to detect @xmath0-rays from faint sources we can now investigate the occurrence of nuclear activity on different power scales .",
    "the detection of faint blazar - like activity in low luminosity agns or even apparently normal galaxies opens a new window on the demographics of @xmath0-ray sources , as well as on the mechanisms that contribute to black hole growth and jet formation .",
    "the possibility that such objects may represent an important contribution to the @xmath0-ray radiation of undetermined origin deserves further investigation .",
    "searching for radiation from hidden agns is a fundamental science case for instruments designed to observe high energy photons and other hints of jet activity , such as light polarization .",
    "therefore , we plan to further investigate the spectroscopic properties of candidate counterparts to @xmath0-ray emission , taking possibly into account light polarization studies as well , through an extensive observational campaign designed for middle class telescopes .",
