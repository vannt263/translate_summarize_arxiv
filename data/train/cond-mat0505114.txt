    "a series of recent works focuses on the synthesis of macromolecular networks by end - linking star polymers @xcite",
    ". now , previous work @xcite has considered hyperbranched polymers , which were iteratively built from rather small units : there the use of regular repeated units allowed a complete , analytical determination of the eigenfrequencies . here",
    "we extend this work by focusing on structures built from stars .",
    "using stars as building blocks allows to vary both @xmath0 , the functionality and also @xmath1 , the numbers of monomers along the arms .",
    "the stars will be envisaged as being end - linked in such a way that two end monomers belonging to two different stars get connected by an additional link . in this way",
    "we obtain a system of branching points connected by spacers ; this system of branching points may , on the other hand , be rather arbitrary , and may by itself form a complex network such as a regular dendrimer @xcite , a branched polymer @xcite or a branched copolymeric structure @xcite .",
    "the simplest method to determine the dynamics of such networks is to treat them as generalized gaussian structures ( ggs ) @xcite : the polymer is viewed as consisting of beads that are linked by harmonic springs . in this way , the classical rouse - model gets adapted to general topologies .",
    "as it is well - known , the rouse - model describes a chain molecule immersed in a viscous solvent , so that for each monomer the damping due to the solvent and the harmonic potential due to the other monomers are accounted for . on the other hand , the rouse - model neglects hydrodynamic interactions , inertia terms , the excluded volume and entanglement effects .",
    "now , the limitations of the rouse model are well understood ; although not very realistic , rouse - models and their extensions are certainly very useful in unraveling the dynamics of complex structures .",
    "@xcite    in the study of networks built from stars we will take all the springs to be equal , but we will differentiate between the monomers at branching points and the monomers along the spacers ; we will let the two kinds of monomers have different mobilities i.e. different friction coefficients .",
    "the reason for this are twofold : first , in many cases stars are prepared by having a central monomer which differs from the other monomers ; second , mathematically this generalization does not significantly burden the formalism . this procedure , on the other hand , allows us to discuss easily the case of copolymers .",
    "now , as was shown in former work @xcite , the relaxation of copolymeric structures containing units of different mobility often differs qualitatively from the relaxation of similar homopolymeric structures , in which all the beads are the same @xcite .    in what the relaxation dynamics of the networks is concerned , we focus on the complex dynamical shear modulus , @xmath2 or in more conventional forms , on its real and imaginary parts , which are the dynamic storage and the loss modulus , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively",
    ". the advantage of looking at these quantities is , first , that they are widely measured , and , second , that there are intimately related to other dynamic quantities , such as the dielectric and the magnetic relaxation .",
    "moreover , in the evaluation of @xmath3 and @xmath4 only the eigenvalues of the underlying connectivity matrix enter , but not the eigenvectors @xcite .",
    "this fact considerably simplifies the mathematical treatment , by allowing us to focus on the eigenvalues . as we proceed to show we can relate the eigenvalues of our system of end - linked stars to the corresponding underlying spacer - free structure .",
    "the basic realization here is that the problem considered here admits an _ exact _ real - space renormalization .",
    "this may appear surprising after the efforts displayed up - to - now @xcite , which lead only to _ approximate _ results .",
    "the interesting feature is that the previous works used models in which some beads were assumed to be fixed @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , it is just this assumption which _ complicates _ the analytical solution ; by allowing all beads to move freely the problem simplifies ( of course , some normal modes leave groups of beads immobile , but this is a result , and not an a priori assumption ) .",
    "the situation here parallels that found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where regular hyperbranched polymers were investigated ; the exact results in @xcite followed earlier works , which were unable to solve the problem exactly , again since they took the positions of the peripheral beads to be fixed .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in the next section we present the model considered and recall the forms of @xmath3 and of @xmath4 in the ggs - formalism . in sec .",
    "3 we explain our renormalization procedure , which allows us to relate analytically the spectra of the networks under investigation to those of simpler structures , in which the spacers and the dangling chains are eliminated . in sec .",
    "4 we display the use of our method in several cases and focus on star polymers , on a cube polymer and on topologically periodic networks .",
    "dendritic structures made out of copolymeric stars are analyzed in sec .",
    "5 , where we present numerical results for @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "6 , while the mathematical details are collected in four appendices .",
    "in the following we consider a system of @xmath5 end - linked polymer stars .",
    "each star consists of a core ( a central @xmath0-coordinated bead ) from which emerge @xmath0 chains of @xmath1 beads each",
    ". the central bead may differ ( chemically and functionally ) from the other beads , a fact which we take into account by assigning it a different friction coefficient . in fig .",
    "[ linked_stars ] we show such a network formed from end - linked stars .",
    "corresponding to the coloring used in fig .",
    "[ linked_stars ] , we call in the following the core bead `` black '' and the chain beads `` white ''",
    ". note that in fig .",
    "[ linked_stars ] the stars are linked at their ends , through the means of @xmath6 additional bonds , to form a single , connected cluster . the linking topologies which we consider are rather arbitrary ;",
    "the restriction that we impose is that the cores ( branching points ) form a simple graph structure . by this",
    "we forbid links between chains belonging to the same star as well as multiple links between two stars .",
    "now we model the system of fig .",
    "[ linked_stars ] in the framework of generalized gaussian structures ( ggs ) , which are an extension of the rouse - model for gaussian chains @xcite .",
    "we focus on networks of beads connected by harmonic springs with elastic constant @xmath7 , and we take the networks to be immersed in a viscous solvent , where the inertial forces can be neglected . the corresponding langevin equations of motion for the system have the form : @xmath8={\\bf f}({\\bf r}_j , t)+{\\bf f}_j(t).\\ ] ] equation ( [ langevin_lambda ] ) expresses the fact that for each bead , say bead @xmath9 at position @xmath10 , the friction force and the elastic forces acting on it exactly balance the external and the fluctuating forces . in eq .",
    "( [ langevin_lambda ] ) , the @xmath11 with @xmath12 denote the positions of the @xmath13 neighbors of bead @xmath9 , @xmath14 is its friction coefficient , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the respective random and external forces ; the fluctuating forces are taken to be gaussian , with @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , we take the friction coefficients of the white beads to be @xmath18 and of the black beads to be @xmath19 .    in the ggs picture @xmath20 , the storage and @xmath21 , the loss modulus are given in terms of the eigenvalues @xmath22 of the homogeneous version of eq .",
    "( [ langevin_lambda ] ) ( where the right - hand - side is put equal to zero ) .",
    "one has namely , in a reduced form @xcite @xmath23 and @xmath24 in eqs .",
    "( [ gprim ] ) and ( [ gdprim ] ) the reduced frequency @xmath25 is given in terms of the fundamental time @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the total number of beads and the @xmath28 are the @xmath29 non vanishing eigenvalues of the system , where @xmath30 given that each star is composed of a core ( black bead ) and of @xmath31 white beads .",
    "as shown previously , @xcite the general forms of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , well - known from the study of homopolymers , also hold for heteropolymeric networks , such as the ones considered here .    to determine the eigenvalues of the left - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ langevin_lambda ] ) we focus on its normal modes , which have the form @xmath32 . inserting them in the left - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ langevin_lambda ] ) leads to the following system of equations : @xmath33 with @xmath27 being the total number of beads in the system , this represents @xmath27 equations . as is well - known from the general theory , the linear system given by eq .",
    "( [ n_j_coord ] ) leads to @xmath29 positive eigenvalues , @xmath34 , and to a single vanishing eigenvalue , @xmath35 .    in the following we look separately at the system of equations belonging to each @xmath36 and for ease of notation",
    "drop the index @xmath36 . for the @xmath37-coordinated core ( black bead ) of each star , eq .",
    "( [ n_j_coord ] ) reads : @xmath38 for the white beads of the spacers ( these are doubly coordinated ) , the corresponding equation is @xmath39 where we numbered the beads consecutively along the spacer . again from eq .",
    "( [ n_j_coord ] ) we have for every peripheral bead @xmath1 ( which is @xmath40-coordinated ) @xmath41    remarkably , the system of eqs .",
    "( [ f_coord ] ) , ( [ 2_coord ] ) and ( [ 1_coord ] ) can be simplified analytically for any arrangement like the one in fig .",
    "[ linked_stars ] .",
    "this fact extends to stars the exact mathematical treatment developed for small building blocks , used in the study of regular hyperbranched structures .",
    "the following section is devoted to the simplification of the system of eqs .",
    "( [ f_coord ] ) , ( [ 2_coord ] ) and ( [ 1_coord ] ) .",
    "the basic idea is that one has an analytical procedure at one s disposal , by which one can `` delete '' most of the beads of the original system , namely those on the spacers and on the dangling chains ; in this way one is led to a smaller , reduced system , consisting of the ( directly - connected ) black beads only .",
    "the procedure is exact and we will develop it in the main body of this section .",
    "the method parallels that of determining the eigenvalues of regular hyperbranched structures , a problem treated in refs .",
    "@xcite , but it is more extensive .",
    "moreover , it will turn out that the eigenvalues of the original system fall naturally into two classes : the first class is the one related to non - vanishing eigenvalues of the reduced black system , while for the second class the corresponding eigenvalue of the reduced system is zero . as a consequence ,",
    "we follow a step - by - step development and focus first on the spacers of a system such as displayed in fig .",
    "[ linked_stars ] , i.e. on the chains of white beads .",
    "consider now fig .",
    "[ linked_stars ] , in which for each pair of linked stars the core black beads are connected by a chain of @xmath42 white beads , and in which each dangling chain consists of @xmath1 white beads .",
    "we consider first an arbitrary chain of white beads and number them sequentially denoting the starting black bead by `` 0 '' . in this way",
    "the amplitudes ( eigenmode components ) of the white beads get denoted by @xmath43 , while that of the black bead gets denoted by @xmath44 . for a dangling chain",
    "the last amplitude is @xmath45 , while for a spacer it is @xmath46 , with @xmath47 denoting the amplitude of the next black bead .",
    "now , all the white beads fulfill eq .",
    "( [ 2_coord ] ) . introducing the notation @xmath48 eq .",
    "( [ 2_coord ] ) reads exemplarily for the white bead @xmath49 : @xmath50 the following considerations are significantly simplified by making use of the chebyshev polynomials @xmath51 of the second kind , see eq .",
    "( 22.2.5 ) of ref .",
    "the first two chebyshev polynomials read : @xmath52 and @xmath53 , table 22.5 of ref .",
    "@xcite , where they are standardized by requiring that @xmath54 .",

    "( [ text_9 ] ) is allowed to be complex .",
    "we now proceed to show by induction that the amplitudes of each pair @xmath62 of white beads along the chain are related to that of the black bead through @xmath63 where here and in the following @xmath64 is implied , if not indicated otherwise .",
    "now , for @xmath65 eq .",

    "this proves that if eq .",
    "( [ text_4 ] ) is valid for @xmath69 , it is also valid for @xmath70 , which completes the induction step .",
    "now , no particular use was made of the fact that @xmath44 stands for the black bead .",
    "we can as well start with bead @xmath70 and work our way back to bead @xmath71 . in this way we obtain : @xmath72    a fundamental , special case of this equation relates the amplitudes of neighboring black beads connected by a spacer : @xmath73 let us now turn to a dangling chain of @xmath1 beads , whose amplitudes are @xmath74 .",

( [ text_16 ] ) to @xmath107 eigenvalues of the full network ( white and black beads ) .",
    "these eigenvalues correspond to eigenmodes of the system that involve the concomitant motion of white and black beads .    in this way we have determined , given that our cluster is composed of @xmath5 stars , a total of @xmath108 eigenvalues .",
    "we recall that the whole system must have @xmath109 eigenvalues , see eq .",
    "( [ 1a ] ) .",
    "evidently , the remaining ( in general , many ) eigenvalues are connected to the zero eigenvalue , @xmath110 , of the black subsystem .",
    "the question arises to determine all the modes of the full system of white and black beads which lead to @xmath111 . now in this case , as is known from general considerations @xcite , the amplitude of all black beads is the same .",

    "( [ 40 ] ) , @xmath135 a small remark concerns now the symmetry of the modes considered . from eq .",
    "( [ text_4 ] ) we have , since @xmath136 that @xmath137 from the point of view of the spacers , this implies that the eigenvalues corresponding to eq .",

    "we display the evaluation of their ( corresponding ) multiplicities in appendix b. the basic idea developed in appendix b is that , due to eq .",
    "( [ f_coord ] ) , for @xmath115 , a non - vanishing value of @xmath139 can not appear alone , but must be compensated by the motion of ( at least ) another bead .",
    "hence , if one starts to look for linearly independent eigenmodes it is reasonable to normalize one of the amplitudes , and set @xmath140 .",

    "we developed a mathematically exact procedure which allows to determine the full eigenvalue spectrum of such networks , by exactly mapping the eigenmode spectrum of a network formed by end - linking star polymers to that of a reduced , core system .",

    "for all these modes we determined their eigenvalue multiplicities ; these depends only on the topology of the core system , i.e. on the total number of stars and on the number of independent loops in the core system , as worked out in appendix b.    we demonstrated the full power of our approach by recovering readily the full spectra of model structures such as star polymers and regular @xmath188-dimensional networks ; we reproduced former results for @xmath189 , and generalized these to arbitrary @xmath188 .",
    "furthermore , we exemplified hidden symmetries of the problem using the `` cube '' polymer as fundamental example . additionally , we performed extensive calculations on dendritic structures containing spacers and dangling chains .",
    "our two - step approach allowed us to readily treat systems containing more than @xmath224 beads ; in fact , numerically we are limited only by our possibility of determining the spectra of the core system ; this means for arbitrary systems , of some @xmath242 black beads , and ( again ) practically unlimited for hierarchical ( fractal , dendritic , regular ) core networks .",
    "we note that a previous approach to dendrimers with spacers @xcite , restricted to systems with fixed peripheral junctions , did not succeed in decoupling the problem and obtained only approximate spectra ( sometimes , even negative , unphysical eigenvalues ) .    considering the relaxation moduli of copolymers",
    ", we find strong effects when the mobilities of the beads involved differ .",
    "also , increasing the length of the arms of the stars leads to smooth transitions between the relaxation behavior due to the core and due to the linear chains .",
    "our method is very general , in that the topology of the core and the details of the stars geometries are ( in a large measure ) arbitrary .",

    "( [ 2stars_a ] ) and ( [ 2stars ] ) , one of @xmath290- and one of @xmath291-type , which replace the previous @xmath310-mode .",
    "however , as shown in appendix c , the additional @xmath290-type mode which would increase @xmath170 by unity and would lead to @xmath1 distinct modes of the whole , black and white system , is only apparently new .",
    "all these seemingly new @xmath1 modes are in fact already included in the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ text_16 ] ) , as we prove in appendix c.      in this appendix we study whether for certain @xmath223 the relation @xmath319 may have solutions related to @xmath101 . here we show that this can occur only if @xmath320 .",

    "making now use of eqs .",
    "( [ text_13 ] ) and ( [ text_16 ] ) we see that : @xmath324 hence , the only possibility is to take @xmath320 , given that we are looking for solutions to @xmath319 with @xmath223 .    to show now that indeed @xmath320 is a possible eigenvalue in the system consisting of the black beads only",
    ", we analyze the existence and the properties of an eigenmode to it .",
    "we start with eq .",
    "( [ text_12 ] ) for the system of black beads , where we consider a general site @xmath325 and its @xmath326 neighbors @xmath327 we now pick the site @xmath9 such that on it @xmath328 is maximal , @xmath329 .",
    "furthermore we choose the amplitudes such that @xmath330 is positive . then from eq .",
    "( [ lambda_equality ] ) @xmath331 this means that , on one side @xmath332 , whereas , by construction , @xmath333 . it follows that we must have @xmath334 .    moreover , inserting @xmath334 into eq .",
    "( [ lambda_ineq ] ) it also follows that we must have @xmath335 for all @xmath336 , which simply implies @xmath337 for all the neighbors of @xmath9 .",
    "obviously , this argument can be repeated for all the @xmath0 neighbors of @xmath9 , etc .",
    "hence , the only mode compatible with @xmath320 is an alternating mode of two sublattices moving against each other .",
    "such a mode is only possible when : first , all black beads have the functionality @xmath0 _ on the black lattice _ , and secondly , _ all _ loops in the structure are even .",
    "one should note that the first condition means that no dangling chains are allowed .",
    "we now turn to the motion of the full lattice ( white and black beads ) ; we recover it by replacing each bond of the black lattice with a spacer of @xmath200 white beads . from eq .",
    "( [ lambda_hom_appendix ] ) the condition @xmath320 implies that the @xmath338 must be odd , @xmath339 , and that there are exactly @xmath1 solutions satisfying this condition . furthermore , based on eq .",
    "( [ new2 ] ) it follows that all these solutions correspond to eigenmodes which are even .",
    "symmetric ( even ) eigenmodes are , however , compatible with having @xmath340 ; on the other hand , from @xmath341 , we have established that we must have @xmath342 .",
    "it follows that @xmath343 , i.e. that in the @xmath341 mode the insertion of spacers that move symmetrically along their bonds leads to the immobilization of the black beads .",
    "we hasten to note that these eigenmodes ( involving white and black beads ) have the same characteristics as the class of eigenmodes discussed in appendix b.    given the relative complexity of the above analysis we have verified it by considering a series of different , alternating black lattices , and by numerically computing the eigenmodes and eigenvalues of the corresponding black and white systems , obtaining perfect agreement in all cases .      here",
    ", we show how the results for the eigenmode spectrum of generalized dendrimers derived in refs . @xcite and @xcite can be simplified by rewriting them in terms of chebyshev polynomials as displayed in eqs .",
