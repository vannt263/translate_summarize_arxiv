    "the process of disk accretion onto a magnetic star is thought to have important consequences for the spin evolution and observational characteristics of neutron stars , white dwarfs , and young stellar objects ( ysos ) .",
    "in particular , if the stellar magnetic field lines penetrate the disk , then they may transmit torques between the disk and the star .",
    "such an interaction has been invoked to explain the spin - up and spin - down episodes observed in x - ray pulsars ( e.g. , ghosh & lamb 1978 , 1979a , 1979b , hereafter gl ; wang 1987 ; lovelace , romanova , & bisnovatyi - kogan 1995 , hereafter lrbk ; yi , wheeler , & vishniac 1997 ) as well as the observed rotation - period distribution in ysos ( e.g. , knigl 1991 ; edwards et al . 1993 ; bouvier et al .",

    "if the field is strong enough , then it may truncate the disk before it reaches the stellar surface and channel the inflowing matter to high stellar latitudes , where the ( by now nearly free - falling ) gas is stopped and thermalized in accretion shocks .",
    "this is the accepted explanation for x - ray pulsars ( accreting magnetic neutron stars ; e.g. , lamb 1989 ) and dm herculis stars ( accreting magnetic white dwarfs ; e.g. , patterson 1994 ) , and it has also been proposed as the origin of the optical / uv `` hot spots '' in classical t tauri stars ( interpreted as accreting magnetic ysos ; e.g. , bertout , basri , & bouvier 1988 ; knigl 1991 ; edwards et al . 1994 ; hartmann , hewett , & calvet 1994 ; lamzin 1995 ; bertout et al .",

    "however , because of the complexity and diversity of the physical processes that are involved , the theory of the interaction between a magnetic star and a surrounding accretion disk remains incomplete .",
    "one key question is whether a steady - state description , which has been adopted in many of the models constructed to date , is appropriate . in a keplerian disk around a star of mass @xmath7 that rotates with angular velocity @xmath8 , the gas interior to the _ corotation radius _ @xmath9 rotates faster than the star , whereas the matter at larger radii rotates more slowly .",
    "if the star , the disk , and the magnetosphere that occupies the space between them can be treated as perfect conductors , then stellar magnetic field lines that thread the disk at any radius other than @xmath10 will undergo secular twisting .",
    "one possibility for establishing a steady state is for the twisting of the field lines to be countered by magnetic diffusivity in the disk ( e.g. , gl ) .",
    "however , in many cases a realistic estimate of the disk diffusivity leads to values that are much too small to justify a steady - state description of a system with a dipolar field configuration except in the immediate vicinity of @xmath10 ( see   [ subsec - resistive - radial ] below ) .    the behavior of twisted magnetic field lines that are anchored in a well - conducting medium has originally been considered in the context of the solar corona by means of semianalytic ( e.g. , aly 1985 ; low 1986 ; wolfson 1994 ; aly 1995 ) and numerical ( e.g. , miki & linker 1994 ; amari et al .",
    "1996a , b ) techniques .",
    "however , direct insight into the field evolution in rotating accretion disks has by now been gained also from explicit investigations of magnetically linked star ",
    "disk systems , in which both semianalytic [ e.g. , van ballegooijen 1994 ( hereafter vb ) ; lynden - bell & boily 1994 ; lrbk ; bardou & heyvaerts 1996 ( hereafter bh ) ] and numerical ( e.g. , hayashi , shibata , & matsumoto 1996 ; goodson , winglee , & bhm 1997 ; miller & stone 1997 ; goodson , bhm , & winglee 1999 ; goodson & winglee 1999 ) approaches have again been employed .",
    "these studies have indicated that the applied twist leads to a strong expansion of the field lines away from the star .",
    "initially , the evolution is quasi - static , with the azimuthal field component building up while the poloidal field structure changes relatively little , but past a certain point the expansion accelerates rapidly and in a finite time ( corresponding to a total twist @xmath11 ) approaches a singular state characterized by the opening of at least a fraction of the field lines .    the evolution of the magnetic field lines after the singular state is reached is another important question",
    "on which there has been no unanimity in the literature . according to one school of thought ( e.g. , lrbk )",
    ", the opening effectively severs the magnetic link between the disk and the star once and for all .",
    "the opposite view is that the star  disk link is reestablished through rapid field - line reconnection in the magnetosphere , and that the field then continues to undergo successive episodes of twisting , expansion , and reconnection ( e.g. , aly & kuijpers 1990 , goodson et at 1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "the latter picture is consistent with the results of numerical simulations of twisted coronal arcades , in which the addition of finite resistivity was found to result in reconnection across the current sheet that forms in that case ( e.g. , miki & linker 1994 ; amari et al .",
    "it has , furthermore , been argued that , in a real magnetosphere , the current concentration will itself facilitate reconnection through the initiation of plasma microinstabilities that give rise to an anomalous resistivity ( e.g. , lamb , hamilton , & miller 1993 ) .",
    "to resolve this question in a quantitative manner , it is necessary to calculate the evolution of the magnetospheric current and particle densities as the field lines are being twisted in order to determine whether an instability is likely to develop before the field expands to such a degree that it becomes effectively open .",
    "when the expanding , twisted field lines approach the singular state , they typically become sharply bent at the disk surface , giving rise to a strong radial stress that tends to push the field outward through the disk for reasonable values of the disk diffusivity .",
    "previous treatments of the problem have either ignored this issue altogether ( e.g. , lrbk ) , concluded that it would lead to the effective expulsion of the field lines from the disk ( bh ) , or else considered the intermediate case in which the radial field excursions average to zero ( vb ) .",
    "the resolution of this issue depends in part on whether reconnection in the magnetosphere terminates the field - line expansion phase before the radial stress at the disk surface becomes very large , and it is thus directly related to the field - opening question .",
    "even if the field configuration is not steady , the duration of the successive expansion / reconnection cycles is sufficiently short [ of order the dynamical ( rotation ) time ] , that one could consider averaging the relevant quantities over the cycle period ( cf .",
    "vb ) and using them in modeling effectively steady - state star  disk systems ( e.g. , gl ; zylstra 1988 ; daumerie 1996 )",
    ". however , the time - dependent nature of the magnetic interaction could be crucial to the origin of the observed accretion and outflow properties of disk - fed magnetic stars ( e.g. , hartmann 1997 ; goodson & winglee 1999 ) , and it may also help resolve some of the difficulties identified in steady - state magnetic accretion models ( e.g. , safier 1998 ) .    in this paper",
    "we address various aspects of the basic issues listed above using a simple , largely semianalytic , approach .",
    "our modeling framework , based on evolving a series of self - similar , force - free equilibrium magnetospheric field configurations , is described in   [ sec - model ] . in ",
    "[ sec - resistive ] we clarify the condition for steady - state evolution in a disk with a given distribution of magnetic flux and diffusivity , and we then consider also the radial migration of flux across the disk . in ",
    "[ sec - magnetosphere ] we examine the opening of twisted magnetic field lines using a uniformly rotating , self - similar disk model , and we investigate the role of reconnection and inertial effects in the magnetosphere above the disk in limiting this process . in   [ sec - keplerian ]",
    "we generalize our analysis of the opening of magnetic field lines by using a non  self - similar model that incorporates a differentially rotating disk . in   [ sec - discussion ]",
    "we discuss our results and relate them to recent numerical simulations .",
    "we summarize in   [ sec - summary ] .",
    "in this section we describe a semianalytic model of a force - free magnetic field above a perfectly conducting thin disk .",
    "this model , which was first developed in 1994 by vb , is distinguished by its relative mathematical simplicity , and we use it to illustrate the relevant ideas and as a framework for our quantitative analysis .",
    "following vb , we consider a uniformly rotating disk that is magnetically linked to a central , point - like star .",
    "this may be an adequate representation of the outer parts of a keplerian disk , at radii @xmath12 , where the beat frequency  @xmath13 [ the difference between the rotation rate  @xmath14 of the disk and the rotation rate  @xmath8 of the star ] is almost independent of @xmath15 ( and is approximately equal to  @xmath16 ) .",
    "we work in spherical coordinates ( @xmath15,@xmath17,@xmath18 ) and assume that the system is axisymmetric .",
    "since the disk is assumed to be infinitely conducting , the distribution of the poloidal magnetic flux @xmath19 on its surface is fixed and does not change as the star rotates relative to the disk : @xmath20 .",
    "this distribution serves as a boundary condition at the disk surface .",
    "we are looking for a _ self - similar _ solution , and , therefore , neither the boundary conditions nor the solution itself can possess a characteristic scale in  @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , @xmath21 must be a power - law function , @xmath22 where the coefficient @xmath23 and the power exponent  @xmath24 are positive real constants .",
    "our goal is to find a time - dependent solution for the magnetic field in the infinitely conducting magnetosphere above the disk . assuming that the plasma density is low enough for the alfvn speed  @xmath25 in the magnetosphere to be much greater than both the relevant keplerian rotation speed  @xmath26 and the sound speed  @xmath27 , the field configuration above the disk at any given time is given by a force - free equilibrium : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a scalar function , constant along each field line . since the boundary conditions of our 2-d problem [ given by @xmath21 ] do not change with time , the only way time enters the problem is through the function @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the time - dependent solution is described by a sequence of equilibria parametrized by @xmath32 , or , equivalently , by the twist angle @xmath33    following vb , the self - similar magnetic field can be written as @xmath34 =   { c\\over r^{n+2 } } \\left[f(\\theta),{{g(\\theta)}\\over{\\sin{\\theta } } } , h(\\theta)\\right]\\ , ,                                              \\eqno{(2.4)}\\ ] ] corresponding to @xmath35 where the functions @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 are also functions of time .",

    "in this section we consider the conditions under which a magnetically linked star  disk configuration can reach a steady state .",
    "we continue to assume , as in   [ sec - model ] , that the star as well as the magnetosphere can be approximated as perfect conductors , but we allow the disk to have a finite resistivity .. ] this picture should be adequate for capturing the basic behavior of real systems . for ease of presentation",

    "however , since the conditions we derive are essentially local , we expect our basic conclusions to remain valid also in the more general case of a differentially rotating disk and a non  self - similar diffusivity . to further simplify the presentation , we first consider the case where the radial positions of the magnetic field lines in the disk remain fixed during the twisting process , so the diffusivity only affects the evolution of the azimuthal field component .",
    "we then examine the consequences of incorporating also radial field diffusion into the picture .",
    "we start by deriving a general expression for the time evolution of the twist angle in the presence of finite disk diffusivity . focusing on a given disk radius  @xmath15",

    "the time evolution of the twist angle is thus given by @xmath143 where , as in   [ sec - model ] , @xmath144 .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side of equation  ( 3.3 ) represents the secular growth of @xmath48 due to the differential rotation between the disk and the star , whereas the second term ( in which @xmath145 ) describes the azimuthal slippage of the field lines relative to the disk material brought about by the finite disk resistivity .",
    "one can alternatively obtain this equation by generalizing the circuit analysis previously used to derive the steady - state condition ( see references below ) to include an inductive contribution to the line integral in faraday s law ( i.e. , @xmath146 ) .",

    "indeed , in this case the radial displacement at any given radius scales as  @xmath15 , with the coefficient of proportionality increasing with twist angle but having the same value at all locations .",
    "therefore , only the overall magnitude of the flux distribution is affected by the footpoint migration , but its self - similar scaling ( and the value of the power - law index  @xmath24 ) remain unchanged .",

    "although inertial effects will intervene to reduce the field - line expansion speed in the magnetosphere to roughly the local alfvn speed ( see   [ subsec - inertial ] ) , the latter will still be much higher than the field diffusion speed in the disk ( which , for a turbulent diffusivity , is of the order of @xmath249 ; see   [ subsec - resistive - toroidal ] ) .",
    "the effect of radial field diffusivity will be even less of an issue if reconnection effects in the magnetosphere terminate the field - line expansion before the critical twist angle is attained ( see   [ subsec - reconnection ] ) , since the value of @xmath243 in this case will remain bounded .    in one proposed scenario ( see   [ sec - intro ] ) , the twisted magnetic field lines reconnect as @xmath48 approaches the critical value , and the process of twisting , expansion , and reconnection recurs in a periodic fashion .",
    "if this indeed is what happens , then it is interesting to inquire whether the system can maintain a _ time - averaged _ steady state despite the expected radial diffusion of the field lines .",
    "vb , who first addressed this question , proposed that this could happen if @xmath97 , since , in that case , the radial magnetic field component at the disk surface ( and hence @xmath223 ) changes sign in the course of the field - line evolution ( see fig .

    "an alternative possibility , which also requires @xmath97 , was proposed by bh for an _ exact _ steady state .",

    "we defer until  [ sec - discussion ] a discussion of the plausibility of real astrophysical systems being represented by such low-@xmath24 configurations .",
    "as we noted in   [ sec - intro ] , magnetic field reconnection across the current concentration region that forms when a twisted flux tube begins to expand is a possible alternative to the opening of the field lines . whether reconnection can compete with the opening process depends in large measure on the magnitude of the plasma resistivity in the region of current concentration .",
    "classical collisional resistivity is generally too small to play a role , and one appeals to anomalous resistivity induced by current - driven microinstabilities .",
    "the instability criterion is that the current density exceed a certain threshold , which is typically proportional to the electron density  @xmath257 .",
    "this suggests that the relevant quantity to examine is the ratio of the current density @xmath258 to  @xmath257 ( or  @xmath259 ) .",
    "anomalous resistivity could thus be triggered not only by the current concentration near @xmath107 but also by the drop in density brought about by the rapid expansion of the toroidal field as the critical twist angle is approached ( see   [ subsec - singularity ] ) .    in this section",
    "we explore this possibility by calculating the velocity and density evolution outside the disk using the sequence of force - free equilibria presented in   [ sec - model ] . as part of this analysis",
    "we also evaluate the inertial effects in the expanding magnetosphere , which must remain small for the force - free equilibrium approximation to be applicable . in order to isolate the resistive effects in the magnetosphere and to distinguish them from the corresponding processes in the disk ( which were considered in   [ sec - resistive ] ) , we assume ( as in   [ sec - model ] ) that the magnetic field remains frozen into the disk material at all times .",

    "however , we expect that in practical applications the effective opening of the field lines will only be delayed by these effects , rather than eliminated altogether ( see   [ sec - discussion ] for a fuller discussion of this point ) .",
    "furthermore , we anticipate that , even in the absence of inertial effects , the field - line expansion in real systems will be terminated by reconnection  although , as we show in the next subsection , inertial effects could also delay the onset of the latter process .      in this subsection",
    "we address the prospects for reconnection in the disk magnetosphere .",
    "we first derive the relevant equations in the self - similar model framework , and then use them to draw some quantitative conclusions using representative parameters for yso systems .",
    "reconnection may occur when the critical twist angle is approached .",
    "it is important to recognize , however , that the twisted field configuration does _ not _ give rise to a fully developed current sheet .",

    ", the required value of  @xmath368 is too small to be accounted for by the classical spitzer resistivity .",
    "it can , however , be expected that near the critical point the ideal mhd approximation will cease to be valid in the region of high current concentration .",
    "one interesting possibility is the development of an effective anomalous resistivity that is triggered by current - driven instabilities . for definiteness ,",
    "we focus on the anomalous resistivity associated with the _ ion - acoustic / buneman instabilities _  the mechanism most commonly considered in the literature ( e.g. , coroniti & eviatar 1977 ; galeev & sagdeev 1984 ; parker 1994 ) .",
    "another possible mechanism for anomalous resistivity is lower - hybrid drift turbulence initiated by a perpendicular current ( see krall & liewer 1971 and drake et al . 1984 , and references therein ) .",
    "however , lower - hybrid instability requires perpendicular electron drift , which is absent in the force - free configurations employed in our model .",
    "a current - driven anomalous resistivity is triggered when the current density exceeds a certain critical value , @xmath369 where @xmath370 is the drift speed of the current - carrying electrons , and the critical speed @xmath371 is of the order of the thermal speed of either electrons or ions ( depending on the nature of the instability ) and is thus a function of the temperature  @xmath372 .",
    "the criterion for triggering reconnection can therefore be written as @xmath373 where @xmath374 is the molecular weight per electron in units of the proton mass .",
    "assuming first , for simplicity , that the magnetosphere is isothermal ( @xmath375 ) , we infer from equation ( 4.34 ) that reconnection is most likely to start at the point where the ratio @xmath376 is maximized . from our analysis we know that , at a fixed  @xmath15 , the current density is maximal , and the density is minimal , at the apex angle @xmath323 ( see fig .",

    "the radial position of the possible reconnection site can not be determined within the framework of the self - similar model adopted here . in a realistic situation involving a keplerian disk , however , we can argue that the ratio @xmath376 will be greatest at the apex point of the field line that underwent the largest expansion , i.e. , the field line with the largest twist angle .",

    "this implies that the time evolution of @xmath383 _ on a given field line _ is governed by the divergence of  @xmath382 at  @xmath323 .",

    "for example , for  @xmath186 , we find @xmath385    so far in this subsection we have assumed that the temperature stays fixed during the evolution .",
    "however , because the field - line expansion is very rapid near the critical point , it might be more realistic to assume that the evolution of the plasma is _ adiabatic _ rather than isothermal .",
    "indeed , let us consider the time scale for temperature equalization due to electron thermal conduction along the magnetic field lines .",
    "for the adopted fiducial parameter values ( see below ) , the electron collisional mean free path is @xmath386 .",

    "we conclude that inertial effects should become important much earlier than the time when reconnection is first triggered .",
    "we note , however , that this conclusion depends on the rather uncertain value of the initial plasma density @xmath414 : if that density were lower , then reconnection could occur while the equilibrium assumption was still valid . for the isothermal case with @xmath186 , this requires ( using eq .",

    "@xmath422 is the plasma frequency , and the subscripts @xmath423 and @xmath424 refer to the electrons and ions , respectively ) , we obtain the corresponding anomalous resistivity from @xmath425 . assuming that the electron and ion temperatures are equal , we then find the effective lundquist number to be @xmath426 where @xmath427 denotes the cyclotron frequency",
    ". we shall use @xmath428 even though the ion - acoustic instability can arise at lower values of the drift speed , since the effective resistivity is not significantly enhanced unless @xmath429 ( e.g. , kadomtsev 1965 ) .",
    "we then get an expression that , interestingly enough , is independent of both density and temperature , @xmath430    the expression ( 4.47 ) is applicable once the condition  ( 4.34 ) ( or its adiabatic counterpart [ 4.40 ] ) is satisfied .",

    "in fact , @xmath434 where @xmath435 .",
    "this demonstrates that , even when excited , the ion - acoustic anomalous resistivity will saturate at a level that is too low to provide an efficient route for reconnection .",
    "it is , however , worth noting that , after being triggered , anomalous resistivity will be strongly localized . over the past two decades , numerical simulations ( ugai & tsuda 1977 ; sato & hayashi 1979 ;",
    "scholer 1989 ; erkaev et al .",
    "2000 ) have shown that a strong local enhancement of resistivity may lead to a transition to petschek s ( 1964 ) regime of fast reconnection .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that , even if one assumes the maximum petschek reconnection inflow velocity , @xmath436 , the length of time available for reconnection ( from the moment when anomalous resistivity is triggered until the singular point  @xmath224 ) will be too short for any significant amount of magnetic flux to be reconnected .",
    "indeed , the condition that all magnetic flux within the area of angular width @xmath437 around the apex is reconnected over the time interval @xmath438 can be written roughly as @xmath439 using @xmath436 together with the expression ( 4.31 ) for @xmath25 , we obtain @xmath440 ^ 2 = \\delta \\theta \\left({{\\delta\\omega r_0}\\over{v_{\\rm a,0}}}\\right ) [ \\ln s_0 + \\ln ( t_{\\rm c}-t)_{\\rm rec}]\\ , .      \\eqno{(4.50)}\\ ] ] neglecting the term @xmath441 compared with @xmath442 in equation ( 4.50 ) , and taking @xmath443 , we get @xmath444 , which greatly exceeds even our highest estimate [ @xmath445 for the available time .    our expressions for the onset time of ion - acoustic microturbulence ( eqs .",

    "we emphasize , however , that even if the initial densities are higher and inertial effects set in early enough to render our onset - time estimates inaccurate , we do not expect the evolution of the field lines to be affected in a qualitative way .",
    "rather , we anticipate that inertial effects will merely _ delay _ the onset of reconnection .",
    "the actual triggering time of the microsinstability could well exceed the nominal critical time @xmath224 , but it may be expected to remain smaller than the effective opening time of the field lines , which will also be increased by the inertial effects ( see   [ subsec - inertial ] ) . in a similar vein , we expect the relative ordering of @xmath447 and @xmath448 ( eq . [ 4.50 ] ) , and therefore our conclusions about the expected efficiency of reconnection , to remain unchanged by the time dilation induced by inertial effects .    finally , we note that a strongly developed _ mhd tearing turbulence _ could , in principle , provide an alternative route to reconnection ( strauss 1988 ) . for the estimated aspect ratio of the current layer that arises in our model , the required fluctuation level that needs to be sustained in order for reconnection to be efficient is @xmath449 .",
    "it is unclear whether such a comparatively high level of turbulence saturation could be attained .",
    "additional uncertainty is created by the expected suppression of the onset and growth of the tearing modes by line - tying effects ( see mok & van  hoven 1982 ) ; this issue has not yet been addressed in the literature and may provide an interesting direction of future research . notwithstanding these caveats ,",

    "the reason for this is that the field lines have by that time expanded very strongly , and our iteration process no longer converges at a given resolution .",
    "instead , we get an unphysical reconnection in the middle of the domain , which renders the numerical procedure inconsistent .",
    "although increasing the resolution helps , the computation time necessary for convergence grows dramatically . , and the diffusion time over a distance @xmath516 is proportional to @xmath517 , which diverges as the field lines expand . ]",

    "we deduce that these functions reach zero at a finite twist angle ( about  2.7  rad for the uniform - rotation case and  2.0  rad for the keplerian case ) , which corresponds to opening of the field lines in a finite time , similar to the behavior of the self - similar solutions .",
    "[ tbp ]    [ tbp ]    we thus see that a good case can be made for the finite - time singularity occurring not only in the self - similar solution ( see   [ subsec - singularity ] ) but also in a broader class of models . to strengthen this point",
    ", we present a simple physical argument showing why this should be the case .",
    "consider the small-@xmath518 limit of equation ( 5.1 ) , in which the nonlinear term @xmath519 for some chosen field line @xmath19 is smaller than , say , the first linear term on the left - hand side at typical distances of order the footpoint radius @xmath46 . by a dimensional analysis ,",
    "this implies @xmath520 small values of @xmath518 may correspond to two qualitatively different solutions .",
    "the first solution is close to the potential field , with the nonlinear term being unimportant everywhere on the field line .",
    "the other solution corresponds to greatly expanded field lines . in the latter solution ,",
    "a given field line stretches out to distances so large that the linear terms ( dimensionally proportional to @xmath521 ) become small and the nonlinear term gives an important contribution to the equilibrium structure of the distant portion of the expanded field . for a given value of  @xmath518",
    ", we can define a characteristic radial scale  @xmath522 where this state of affairs will prevail , @xmath523 the expression ( 5.18 ) also gives an order - of - magnitude estimate of the position @xmath524 of the apex of the field line @xmath19 at the time when @xmath53 has the value @xmath497 .",
    "our next step is to use this estimate to calculate the twist angle corresponding to the field line @xmath19 at time  @xmath32 .",
    "this can be easily accomplished by using equations  ( 5.2 ) and ( 5.3 ) and _ assuming _ that there are no thin scales ( i.e. , current sheets ) in the @xmath17  direction .",
    "this means that the part of the field line that corresponds to @xmath525 is finite in  @xmath17 .",
    "then one can write : @xmath526    now , @xmath527_{\\rm min}$ ] can be estimated simply as @xmath528 .",
    "thus , @xmath529    therefore , to lowest order in @xmath518 , the twist angle becomes independent of  @xmath518 as @xmath530 for a given field line .",
    "that is , as  @xmath518 goes to zero and the field lines open , @xmath48 approaches a finite value and we have a finite - time singularity .",
    "in this section we consider the implications of our work to the various modeling issues discussed in   [ sec - intro ] .",
    "we start with one of our key results , namely , the finding (   [ sec - resistive ] ) that real astrophysical systems are unlikely to reach an exact steady state unless they have significant _ negative _ radial field components at the disk surface in their untwisted ( potential ) state ( corresponding to an @xmath256 magnetic field configuration in the self - similar representation ) .",
    "we now argue that such low - effective-@xmath24 configurations are not likely to be realized in axisymmetric , magnetically linked star  disk systems .",
    "although models in which the stellar magnetic field is pulled into the disk have been considered in the literature ( e.g. , ostriker & shu 1995 ) , and @xmath243 is @xmath531 even for a strictly dipolar field if the disk has a finite height , it is difficult to imagine that strong negative radial field components would naturally develop in the course of disk accretion onto a magnetized star .",
    "in fact , simple global disk models ( e.g. , spruit & taam 1990 ) indicate that , so long as the disk is at least partially conductive , it will tend to exclude the ( dipolar ) stellar magnetic field and cause some of the magnetic flux to remain trapped inside its inner radius , thereby giving rise to a _ positive _ radial field component at the disk surface .",
    "furthermore , there has been no indication from any of the numerical simulations carried out to date that the magnetic field in a disk interacting with a central dipole can evolve into an @xmath256 configuration .",
    "although the published simulations have all been strictly 2-d , such systems are even less likely in 3-d .",
    "this is because the steady - state values of @xmath532 are expected to be well in excess of 1 for @xmath533 ( see table 1 ) , implying that the field configuration might be susceptible to a disruptive , nonaxisymmetric instability ( e.g. , kadomtsev 1966 ) .",
    "it is conceivable , however , that negative values of @xmath243 would occur in the case of a _ nonaxisymmetric _ field configuration .",
    "nonaxisymmetry could be introduced by the misalignment of a stellar dipolar field axis with the disk axis , which is , in fact , the common interpretation of many of the observed periodicities in accreting magnetic stars ( e.g. , lamb 1989 ; patterson 1994 ; bertout et al .",
    "alternatively , it could arise from the presence of isolated stellar magnetic loops that thread the disk ( e.g. , bertout et al .",
    "1996 ; safier 1998 ) .",
    "the latter possibility is consistent with the inferred ( by radio observations ) existence of extended ( @xmath534 ) , organized magnetic structures in certain ysos ( e.g. , andr et al .",
    "the axisymmetric self - similar model with @xmath535 could provide a qualitative representation of the field evolution in this case , but some important aspects , such as the possibility that only a fraction of the field lines open first ( e.g. , amari et al",
    ". 1996b ) , or the development of kink and/or buckling instabilities ( e.g. , parker 1979 ) , might be captured only in a fully 3-d calculation . in any case , although such systems might attain a steady time - averaged configuration , they could never be in a strictly steady state .",
    "another new result of our work has been the demonstration (   [ subsec - resistive - radial ] ) that , even in disks with a comparatively low diffusivity , in which the field lines are twisted until they open up , one can not consistently neglect the _ radial _ migration of the magnetic footpoints in the disk as the critical twist angle @xmath90 is approached .",
    "we have argued that it is unlikely that a state with @xmath536 ( even just in a time - averaged sense ) can be attained unless , again , the magnetic field configuration corresponds to that of an @xmath256 self - similar model . under these circumstances , a disk that undergoes cycles of successive opening and closing ( by reconnection ) of twisted field lines ( and , to a lesser extent ,",
    "even a disk in which a steady - state twist is maintained ) should manifest a secular evolution of the radial flux distribution .",
    "we have explicitly shown , however , that the rate of outward flux diffusion in the disk is significantly smaller than the rate of expansion of the twisted field lines in the overlying magnetosphere .",
    "this provides a strong argument _ against _ the suggestion made by bh that the field lines in low - diffusivity disks remain perpendicular to the disk surface at all times .",
    "bh s conclusion that the twisting process will tend to expel to the outer edge of the disk almost all the stellar field lines that initially threaded it can be questioned on similar grounds .",
    "although an outward flux migration might take place , we consider it unlikely that it would lead to a flux rearrangement in the disk that is as drastic as envisioned by bh .",
    "in fact , in certain cases a steady time - averaged flux distribution may be established .",
    "this is evidently the case in the time - dependent model presented by goodson et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and goodson & winglee ( 1999 ) , in which inward radial mass motions that counter the outward radial flux diffusion take place in the disk .",
    "we have also investigated (   [ sec - magnetosphere ] ) the density redistribution in the magnetosphere brought about by the motion of the twisted field lines .",
    "we showed that , as the critical twist angle is approached , the density in the apex region of the elongated flux ropes drops precipitously , with some of the depleted mass being pushed toward the rotation axis , where it becomes concentrated in a narrow angular sector about @xmath73 .",
    "a similar axial density enhancement has been found in the numerical simulations of goodson et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1999 ; see also hayashi et al .",
    "1996 ) , where it is directly associated with the formation of an overdense , `` knotty '' jet . as already noted by goodson et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , this mechanism of producing axially outflowing condensations requires a good alignment between the rotation and magnetic dipole axes . although our sequence - of - equilibria representation can not capture the complex dynamical evolution of the simulated jets , it is gratifying that this simple model nonetheless allows a quantitative description of the basic process that generates their density structure . ) . ]",
    "although inertial effects slow down the field - line expansion , one can expect that the twisted field lines will still _ effectively open _ in a finite time . by this",
    "we mean that for any region of a given size threaded by a finite amount of flux , the apexes of the majority of the field lines will leave the region under condsideration after being twisted by a finite angle .",
    "this is indeed the behavior found in numerical simulations .",
    "for example , in the model of goodson et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , even though inertial effects are enhanced by a relatively high initial mass loading of the magnetosphere and by subsequent episodes of post - reconnective mass ejection from the disk , the field lines typically open in less than one differential star ",
    "disk rotation period ( as stated in goodson & winglee 1999 ) , which is to be compared with the time ( @xmath537 period ) predicted by our model in the absence of inertial effects ( see   [ sec - model ] and   [ sec - keplerian ] ) .",
    "the basic question is then whether the field lines eventually reconnect , resulting in a repetitive cycle of inflation and reconnection , or whether the opening process is essentially a one - time affair .",
    "the 2-d numerical simulations carried out to date do not provide a clear answer to this question . although reconnection was found to take place in the work of hayashi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , this was probably a consequence of their adoption of an unrealistically low threshold value of @xmath376 for the onset of anomalous resistivity and of a rather strong functional dependence [ @xmath538 above the threshold .",
    "numerical diffusivity was evidently also responsible for the reconnection events observed in the simulations by romanova et al .",
    "( 1998 ) of twisted , _",
    "disk - anchored _ magnetic loops . in the case of the numerical model of goodson",
    "et al . ( 1999 ) , the nominal value of the numerical resistivity - based lundquist number in the innermost zone was @xmath539 at the start of their run . as noted in   [ subsec - reconnection ] , our self - similar model results indicate that a value in this range is compatible with current - driven sweet - parker reconnection .",
    "however , the reconnection that actually took place in this simulation was triggered by inward mass motions at the inner radius of the disk that strongly pinched the magnetosphere ( see also miller & stone 1997 ) .",
    "our analysis of the 2-d self - similar model has led us to the conclusion that ion - acoustic microinstability will be triggered too late to result in significant reconnection before the field lines effectively open .",
    "the crux of the problem is that the current layer that forms in this geometry along the field - line elongation direction is comparatively wide ( aspect ratio @xmath540 for an initially dipolar field ) , so the effective lundquist number that is required for efficient reconnection is rather low and is attained only relatively late in the field - line opening process . tearing - mode turbulence could , in principle , lead to reconnection on the required scale if the tearing fluctuation level is sufficiently high . as discussed by strauss ( 1988 ) , such turbulence can occur in 3-d , giving rise to hyperresistivity that may result in fast reconnection .",
    "we can , in fact , argue more generally that , in contrast with the idealized 2-d configurations that we employed in our model , real 3-d systems may exhibit nonaxisymmetric behavior that could significantly broaden the range of possible scenarios .",
    "for example , it seems quite probable that , as the field lines are twisted , the 2-d equilibrium will become unstable to nonaxisymmetric mhd perturbations , such as the kink mode ( a possibility already mentioned by lrbk ) .",
    "the detailed mhd stability analysis that is required for a closer examination of this suggestion is beyond the scope of this paper , but it seems likely that such instabilities could induce a transition to a new , nonaxisymmetric configuration that might have real ( i.e. , infinitesimally thin ) current sheets .",
    "such current sheets could form sites of rapid reconnection that would enable the system to relax to a less stressed state , and it is quite probable that the field - line expansion would then terminate much sooner than in the 2-d scenario considered above .",
    "this possibility could be checked by means of future 3-d numerical simulations .",
    "we thus regard it as highly plausible that reconnection , leading to periodic ( or quasi - periodic ) evolution , would be the realistic outcome of the field - line twisting process .",
    "this inherently nonsteady behavior enhances the attractiveness of this scenario as a modeling framework . in particular , in the case of ysos , it could be relevant to the interpretation of such phenomena as x - ray flares , the formation of a `` knotty '' axial jet and of a less collimated and slower ( but more massive ) disk outflow , and the heating of the permitted line - emitting gas in the magnetosphere ( e.g. , hayashi et al . 1996 ; hirose et al .",
    "1997 ; miller & stone 1997 ; hartmann 1997 ; shu et al .",
    "1997 ; goodson et al .",
    "1997 , 1999 ; goodson & winglee 1999 ) . furthermore , since the successive openings and reconnections of the field lines have been inferred to modulate the gas inflow rate onto the star and the net torque exerted on the star by the accreting matter , they would also have a direct impact on the mass and spin evolution of the protostar .",
    "it may nevertheless be possible to construct stationary , global models of accretion disks in such systems by obtaining a suitable time average of the magnetic field configuration .",
    "this is , in fact , the approach originally undertaken by gl and subsequently elaborated upon by zylstra ( 1988 ) and daumerie ( 1996 ) . in particular , daumerie developed a model in which the flux distribution along the disk is calculated by approximating the magnetic field in the magnetosphere as being current - free and by using an effective conductivity ( based on the value of @xmath541 through a relation analogous to our eq .",
    "[ 3.5 ] ) to evaluate the poloidal field components in the disk .",
    "we note , however , that inasmuch as the azimuthal currents ( which determine the disk contribution to the poloidal magnetic field ) flow entirely inside the disk , one should employ the actual disk conductivity in this calculation instead of the above ansatz , as the latter could significantly overestimate the correct value in regions where the effective surface conductivity exceeds the limit ( 3.6 ) .",
    "it may also be possible to refine the treatment of the magnetospheric field by using the approach outlined in ",
    "[ sec - keplerian ] to calculate the magnetic field configuration in the fully force - free formulation ( i.e. , without neglecting current flows in the magnetosphere ) .",
    "after identifying the time at which reconnection is most likely to occur , one could proceed to derive the time - averaged values of @xmath542 and @xmath543 and use them as boundary conditions for the disk model .",
    "past numerical simulations have proved invaluable in clarifying some apparent difficulties and in pointing the way to further theoretical progress .",
    "for example , safier ( 1998 ) has raised concerns about the ability of the magnetic field lines to thread the disk rather than be swept out in a thermally driven stellar wind .",
    "however , the numerical simulations ( which typically do include thermal effects ) have demonstrated that a field with an initially dipolar topology can maintain a configuration in which it continuously threads the disk even as some field lines open and drive an outflow , and that various time - dependent effects ( such as field - line twisting and mass motions in and out of the disk plane ) combine to increase its strength above naive , steady - state estimates .",
    "nevertheless , more refined simulations ( affording better control on the field diffusivity and incorporating 3-d effects ) are needed to fully resolve this and other still - open issues .",
    "disk accretion onto a magnetic star occurs in a variety of astrophysical contexts , ranging from t tauri stars to x - ray pulsars .",
    "the magnetohydrodynamic interaction between the stellar field and the accreting matter can have a strong effect on the disk structure , the transfer of mass and angular momentum between the disk and the star , and the production of bipolar outflows . in this paper we concentrated on a key element of this interaction  the time evolution of the magnetic field lines that thread the disk resulting from the relative rotation between the disk and the star  and studied it using simplified models of axisymmetric , force - free fields .",
    "in particular , we employed the semianalytic similarity solution first derived by van ballegooijen ( 1994 ) and lynden - bell & boily ( 1994 ) to construct a sequence of magnetospheric equilibria parametrized by the relative twist angle @xmath84 , but we tested the generality of the basic conclusions of this model ( which strictly applies only to a uniform relative angular speed ) by constructing numerical solutions of the grad - shafranov equation for systems with rotation laws that approximate a keplerian disk .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows .",
    "* on the assumption that both the star and the magnetosphere can be approximated as being perfectly conducting , the behavior of the twisted field lines depends on the magnitude of the surface conductivity @xmath127 of the disk .",
    "a steady - state configuration can be established only if , at a radius @xmath15 in the disk , @xmath544 ( eq . [ 3.6 ] ) .",
    "weakly ionized protostellar disks as well as disks characterized by a turbulent diffusivity typically do not satisfy this condition except very close to the corotation radius , implying that the field lines undergo secular inflation and will open up when a critical twist angle @xmath545 ( @xmath546 for an initially dipolar field configuration ) is reached . *",
    "if inertial effects in the magnetosphere could be neglected , then the field lines would open in a fraction of the differential star  disk rotation period .",
    "however , inertial effects intervene , slowing down the expansion speed at the apex of the twisted field line to the local alfvn speed ( which , for an initial dipolar field and a power - law density distribution , remains constant throughout the evolution in the self - similar model ) . this will delay the effective opening of the field lines , but will not by itself prevent it from occurring . *",
    "if @xmath547 and the field lines undergo a strong expansion , then the radial magnetic stresses at the disk surface will cause the field lines to start migrating outward .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by bardou & heyvaerts ( 1996 ) , who went on to suggest that the field lines will be rapidly expelled from the disk .",
    "we argued , however , that this is unlikely to happen in view of the fact that the radial diffusion in the disk is much slower than the field - line expansion in the magnetosphere .",
    "if the field lines expand and reconnect in a periodic manner then a time - averaged steady state in which the mean surface radial field is zero is in principle possible ( van ballegooijen 1994 ) , but this situation will not arise if the initial field configuration is dipolar ( although it might conceivably pertain to isolated stellar flux tubes that thread the disk ) . *",
    "the opening of the field lines induces a redistribution of the magnetospheric density @xmath259 .",
    "in particular , it leads to a strong depletion of mass near the apex of the expanding field lines ( which typically elongate in a direction making an angle @xmath548 to the rotation axis ) and to a pronounced density enhancement near the rotation axis .",
    "the decrease in density along the direction of elongation ( which also marks the location of a @xmath6 current layer ) is conducive to the triggering of microinstabilities ( such as ion - acoustic ) , since the instability onset condition corresponds to a threshold value of @xmath376 .",
    "the density enhancement near the axis ( which is largely a byproduct of the axisymmetry assumption ) represents a possible mechanism for the formation of an axially outflowing condensation ( generalizing to a `` knotty '' jet if the process is repetitive ) , as suggested previously ( e.g. , goodson et al .",
    "1999 ) on the basis of numerical simulations .",
    "* the question of whether the evolution of the twisted field culminates in the effective opening of the field lines ( e.g. , lovelace et al . 1995 ) , or whether it is a repetitive process ( e.g. , aly & kuijpers 1990 ) of field - line expansion and reconnection ( not necessarily back to exactly the same field configuration that existed before the most recent expansion , in which case it will not be strictly periodic ) , is still open .",
    "the reconnection events observed in the numerical simulations carried out to date are by and large due to numerical diffusivity and therefore do not provide conclusive answers . based on an analysis of the 2-d self - similar model , we concluded that anomalous resistivity derived from the ion - acoustic / buneman instability will be triggered too late for significant reconnection to take place across the comparatively wide ( aspect ratio @xmath540 for an initially dipolar field ) current layer that forms in this case before the field lines effectively open .",
    "we suggested , however , that hyperresistivity associated with tearing - mode turbulence ( strauss 1988 ) might lead to efficient reconnection , although whether such turbulence could arise in the configuration under consideration is not clear .",
    "in addition , it is conceivable that even faster reconnection could take place as a result of 3-d kinking of the twisted field lines that would create genuine ( i.e. , infinitesimally thin ) current sheets .",

    "<S> we consider disk accretion onto a magnetic star under the assumption that the stellar magnetic field permeates the disk and that the magnetosphere that lies between the disk and the star is force free . </S>",
    "<S> using simplified axisymmetric models ( both semianalytic and numerical ) , we study the time evolution of the magnetic field configuration induced by the relative rotation between the disk and the star . we show that , if both the star and the magnetosphere can be approximated as being perfectly conducting , then the behavior of the twisted field lines depends on the magnitude of the surface conductivity of the disk . for any given relative azimuthal speed @xmath0 between the disk and the star ( measured at the disk surface ) , </S>",
    "<S> there is a maximum surface conductivity @xmath1 such that , if the actual surface conductivity is smaller than @xmath2 , then a steady - state field configuration can be established , whereas for larger values no steady state is possible and the field lines inflate and open up when a critical twist angle ( which for an initially dipolar field is @xmath3 ) is attained . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that thin astrophysical disks are likely to have surface conductivities that exceed the local @xmath2 except in regions where @xmath4 is particularly small ( such as the immediate vicinity of the corotation radius in a keplerian disk ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that , if the disk conductivity is high enough for the twist angle to continue growing until the field lines open , then , except under rather special circumstances , the radial magnetic field at the disk surface will grow to a level for which the radial migration of the field lines in the disk can not be ignored . </S>",
    "<S> a similar conclusion was reached by bardou & heyvaerts ( 1996 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate , however , that the radial diffusion in the disk is much slower than the field - line expansion in the magnetosphere , which suggests that , contrary to the claim by bardou & heyvaerts , the twisting process does _ not _ result in a rapid expulsion of the field lines from the disk .    </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the magnetospheric density redistribution brought about by the field - line expansion and show that inertial effects in the magnetosphere will slow the expansion ( and invalidate the assumption of a force - free field ) before the critical twist angle is reached . </S>",
    "<S> we argue , however , that these effects merely slow down the opening process but do not inhibit it altogether . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the field opening drastically reduces the density near the apex of the expanding field lines ( which typically elongate in a direction making an angle @xmath5 to the rotation axis ) while also creating a pronounced density enhancement near the rotation axis . </S>",
    "<S> the former effect is conducive to the triggering of microinstabilities ( e.g. , ion - acoustic ) in the @xmath6 current layer that forms along the direction of elongation , whereas the latter is evidently related to a mechanism for the formation of an axially outflowing condensation that was previously identified in axisymmetric numerical simulations of such systems .    </S>",
    "<S> we examine the possibility that the expanding field lines reconnect across the current layer before they open up , so that the twisting leads to a quasi - periodic process of field - line expansion and reconnection and not just to a one - time opening event . </S>",
    "<S> we tentatively conclude that hyperresistivity associated with tearing - mode turbulence could lead to efficient reconnection , but we speculate that even faster reconnection might be brought about by 3-d kinking of the twisted field lines that gave rise to thin current sheets </S>",
    "<S> . this question could be further pursued through mhd stability calculations and 3-d numerical simulations .    </S>",
