    "if we fix a finite field @xmath0 , we can ask about the distribution of the number of ( @xmath0-rational ) points on a random curve over @xmath0 . there has been a surge of recent activity on this question including definitive answers of kurlberg and rudnick for hyperelliptic curves @xcite , of bucur , david , feigon and laln for cyclic @xmath2-fold covers of @xmath3 @xcite , of bucur , david , feigon and laln for plane curves @xcite , and of bucur and kedlaya on curves that are complete intersections in smooth quasiprojective subschemes of @xmath8 @xcite . in the first three cases ,",
    "the average number of points on a curve in the family is @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast , for curves that are complete intersections in @xmath8 , the average number of points is @xmath5 , despite , as pointed out by bucur and kedlaya , the abundance of @xmath0 points lying around in @xmath8 . in this paper , we give the distribution of the number of points on trigonal curves over @xmath0 ( i.e. curves with a degree @xmath9 map to @xmath3 ) , and in particular show that the average number of points is greater that @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath10 our main theorem is the following .",
    "[ t : main ] let @xmath0 have characteristic @xmath11 .",
    "we have @xmath12 where the @xmath13 are independent identically distributed random variables and @xmath14    moreover , we give a rigorous explanation of the random variables @xmath13 .",
    "theorem  [ t : main ] is a corollary of the following , which gives the distribution of the number of points in the fiber over a given @xmath0-rational point of @xmath3 .",
    "[ t : bypoint ] let @xmath0 have characteristic @xmath11 . given a point @xmath15 , @xmath16 moreover , these probabilities ( of various size fibers ) are independent at the @xmath0 points @xmath17 of @xmath3 .",
    "the average number of points of a random trigonal curve over @xmath0 ( in the @xmath18 limit as above ) is @xmath1 .",
    "the method used in this paper will be to relate trigonal curves to cubic extensions of function fields , and then to use the work of datskovsky and wright @xcite to count cubic extensions with every possible fiberwise behavior above each rational point of the base curve .",
    "in fact , our methods work with any smooth curve @xmath19 over @xmath0 replacing @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath20 be the moduli space of genus @xmath21 curves with a specified degree @xmath9 map to @xmath19 .",
    "[ t : ebypoint ] let @xmath0 have characteristic @xmath11 . given a point @xmath22 , @xmath23 moreover , these probabilities ( of various size fibers ) are independent at the @xmath0 points of @xmath19 .",
    "in particular , the average number of points of a random curve over @xmath0 with a degree @xmath9 map to @xmath19 ( in the @xmath18 limit ) is @xmath24 .      studying the distribution of the number of points on a curve is equivalent to studying the distribution of the trace of frobenius on the @xmath25-adic cohomology group @xmath26 .",
    "bucur , david , feigon and laln , for cyclic @xmath2-fold covers of @xmath3 , in fact give the finer information of the distribution of the trace of frobenius on each subspace of @xmath26 invariant under the cyclic action .",
    "their methods , under appropriate interpretation , use kummer theory to enumerate the cyclic @xmath2-fold covers of @xmath3 , and thus require the hypothesis that @xmath27 .",
    "the hardest part of the method is sieving for @xmath2-power free polynomials .",
    "the work of bucur , david , feigon and laln for plane curves @xcite and of bucur and kedlaya on curves that are complete intersections @xcite is also given `` fiberwise , '' ( as in theorems  [ t : bypoint ] and [ t : ebypoint ] of this paper ) in that it computes the probability that any point is the ambient space is in a random smooth curve in the specified family and shows these probabilities are independent .",
    "( here we think of the embedding of a curve @xmath28 , and @xcite computes for each point @xmath29 the distribution of the size of the fiber @xmath30 for random @xmath31 .",
    "note that since @xmath32 is an embedding , in this case the fiber has either 0 or 1 points , so these are bernoulli random variables . )",
    "kurlberg and wigman @xcite have also studied the distribution of the number of @xmath0 points in families of curves in which the average number of points is infinite .    in section  [ s :",
    "further ] of this paper , we discuss distribution of points on other families of @xmath6-gonal curves , and in particular give a conjecture for the expected number of points on a random @xmath6-gonal curve with full @xmath7 monodromy , based on function field analogs of bhargava s heuristics for counting number fields .",
    "the conjecture in fact predicts the expected number of points in a fixed fiber over @xmath3 .",
    "when one instead fixes a genus @xmath21 and lets @xmath33 tend to infinity , the philosophy of katz and sarnark @xcite predicts how the average number of points behaves , and in particular it should be governed by statistics of random matrices in a group depending on the monodromy of the moduli space of curves under consideration .",
    "let @xmath0 have characteristic @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath19 be a smooth curve over @xmath0 , and let @xmath35 be the function field of @xmath19 .",
    "then smooth , integral curves over @xmath0 with finite , degree 3 maps to @xmath36 are in one - to - one correspondence with cubic extensions @xmath37 of @xmath35",
    ". however , these smooth , integral curves may not be geometrically integral . in this case",
    ", the only such possibility is given by a cubic extension of the constant field of @xmath19 , and since we will take a @xmath18 limit , we can ignore this extension altogether .",
    "we now consider all the possible completions of a cubic extension @xmath37 of @xmath35 . for a place @xmath38 of @xmath35 , the absolute tame galois group of the local field @xmath39 is topologically generated by @xmath40 with the relation @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a generator of the inertia subgroup and @xmath43 is a frobenius element . for a place @xmath38 of @xmath35 , the following is a chart of all possible cubic tale @xmath39 algebras @xmath44 ( and thus of all possible isomorphism types for @xmath45 ) . to each isomorphism type",
    ", we note the images of @xmath40 from the absolute galois group of @xmath39 in the associated representation to @xmath46 ( given by the action of galois on the three homomorphisms @xmath47 ) , the number of @xmath0 rational points in the fiber above @xmath38 , and a constant @xmath48 that will be important later .",
    "( it turns out that @xmath49 , but this fact will not be used . )    [ cols= \" < , < , < ,",
    "< , < \" , ]     let @xmath50 be the set of places of @xmath35 corresponding to the @xmath0-rational points of @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath51 be a choice @xmath52 of a cubic tale @xmath39 algebra for each @xmath53 .",
    "we define @xmath54 , where the constants @xmath55 are defined by the chart above .",
    "we also choose a @xmath56 similarly .",
    "let @xmath57 be the number of isomorphism classes of cubic extensions @xmath37 of @xmath35 such that for all @xmath53 , we have @xmath58 , and such that the norm of the relative discriminant @xmath59 now we can state the result of datskovsky and wright and cubic extensions of function fields .    [ t : dw ] in the above notation @xmath60    theorem  [ t : ebypoint ] now follows because the above chart gives all the possibilities for the completions of cubic extensions @xmath37 of @xmath35 at each @xmath0-rational place of @xmath35 ( and the thus determined number of @xmath0-rational points in that fiber ) , and theorem  [ t : dw ] gives their relative probabilities . for a triple cover @xmath61",
    "corresponding to an extension @xmath62 , we have @xmath63 , where @xmath64 , and thus we can replace the limit in @xmath6 with a limit in @xmath21 .",
    "the above computations of the distribution of points of trigonal curves suggests that similar questions could be attacked for @xmath6-fold covers of @xmath3 ( or an arbitrary curve ) using methods from the study of counting extensions of global fields by their discriminants , which has been more heavily studied in the case of number fields . in analog to this work , one would naturally only study @xmath6-gonal curves with a specified monodromy group ( i.e. the galois group of the galois closure of the field extension ) .",
    "however , for this method to apply , one needs information on the densities of local behaviors of those number fields . in the number field case ,",
    "such results are only currently available for cubic extensions ( the work of datskovsky and wright @xcite used above , or going back to davenport and heilbronn @xcite over @xmath65 ) , for @xmath66 galois extensions ( @xcite ) , and for degree @xmath6 extensions with galois closure group @xmath7 and @xmath67 ) ( by work of bhargava @xcite ) .",
    "the first two cases above also have results in the function field case , which have been applied in this paper and forthcoming work of the author , respectively .",
    "it is intriguing to ask if a function field version of bhargava s counting results @xcite could give the distribution of the number of points of @xmath68-gonal and @xmath69-gonal curves . in analogy with the number field case ,",
    "one expects such methods would only count @xmath68-gonal curves with @xmath70 monodromy , and that @xmath71-monodromy curves would be a non - negligible portion of all @xmath68-gonal curves . since the methods for counting @xmath71 quartic extensions have not given any results on densities of local behaviors or independence of those behaviors , understanding the distribution of points of @xmath68-gonal curves with @xmath71 monodromy would be very interesting .    in the case of @xmath6-gonal curves with full @xmath7-monodromy , we can at least predict what the distribution of the number of points in each fiber should be using the heuristics of bhargava ( * ? ? ? * conjecture 5.1 ) . in particular , we give the prediction for the average .",
    "[ c ] let @xmath19 be a smooth curve over a finite field @xmath0 of characteristic @xmath72 and fix @xmath22 .",
    "the average number of points in the fiber over @xmath73 of a random curve over @xmath0 with a degree @xmath6 map to @xmath19 and full monodromy ( in the @xmath18 limit ) is @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the number of partitions of @xmath6 into @xmath76 parts such that the parts take exactly @xmath35 values and @xmath77 is the number of partitions of @xmath6 into @xmath76 parts .",
    "it seems within reach to prove this conjecture for @xmath67 by proving function field analogs of @xcite . for @xmath78",
    "the expected fiber size is ( conjecturally ) @xmath79 and for @xmath80 the expected fiber size is ( conjecturally ) @xmath81 in particular , we now show that conjecture  [ c ] follows from the function field analog of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* conjecture 5.1 ) .",
    "let @xmath35 be the function field of @xmath19 and @xmath38 place of @xmath19 corresponding to a @xmath39-rational point .",
    "then ( * ? ? ?",
    "* conjecture 5.1).gives conjectures for local densties for @xmath39 algebras among @xmath82 while @xmath37 ranges over degree @xmath6 @xmath7-extensions of @xmath35 .",
    "in particular , ( * ? ? ? * conjecture 5.1 ) predicts , as we range over degree @xmath6 tale @xmath39 algebras @xmath44 , that @xmath44 appears with relative density @xmath83 ( recall @xmath84 is the absolute norm of the relative discriminant of @xmath85 ) .",
    "recall that isomorphism classes of degree @xmath6 tale @xmath39 algebras exactly correspond to continuous homomorphisms @xmath86 , and we can rephrase the above to say that @xmath44 appears with relative density @xmath87 continuous homomorphisms @xmath86 correspond to choices @xmath88 such that @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",
    "the number of @xmath0 rational points above @xmath38 in the curve corresponding to the extension @xmath37 of @xmath35 is given by the number of @xmath91-orbits on @xmath92 that are also @xmath93-orbits .",
    "let @xmath94 have @xmath95 orbits of size @xmath96 , for @xmath97 .",
    "then the number of @xmath98 such that @xmath89 is @xmath99 .",
    "if we consider a single cycle @xmath100 of @xmath42 of length @xmath96 , then the number of @xmath98 such that @xmath100 remains a @xmath91-orbit is @xmath101 .",
    "so given the choice of @xmath42 , the expected contribution of @xmath100 to rational points is @xmath102 .",
    "thus , given a choice of @xmath42 , the expected number of rational points is @xmath35 , the number of distinct cycle lengths of @xmath42 .",
    "note that @xmath99 is the size of the centralizer of @xmath42 , so choosing a permutation @xmath94 with relative probability @xmath103 is the same as choosing it with relative probability @xmath104 or @xmath105 .",
    "this is equivalent to choosing a conjugacy class in @xmath7 , i.e. a partition of @xmath6 , with relative probability @xmath106 .",
    "since a partition with @xmath35 distinct part sizes , gives an expected @xmath35 parts , conjecture  [ c ] follows from the function field analog of ( * ? ? ?",
