    "one of the most fundamental discoveries in hadron interactions at high energies is the rise of total cross  sections with energy .",
    "it is accompanied by the rise of elastic and inelastic cross  sections as well as of the ratio of elastic to the total cross  section .",
    "for the first time the total cross  section increase was observed in @xmath1interactions at the serpukhov accelerator in 1970 @xcite and it was discovered later in @xmath2interactions at cern isr @xcite and at fermilab @xcite in other nucleon and meson  proton interactions .",
    "recent hera data @xcite demonstrated the rising behavior of the virtual photon ",
    "proton total cross - sections . since then a great progress in the experimental and theoretical studies of hadronic reactions was achieved .",
    "quantum chromodynamics appeared as a theory of strong interactions and gave an explanation for the behavior of the observables in the hard hadronic reactions , i.e. the reactions with high momentum transfers .",
    "however , the dynamics of long distance interactions ( soft processes ) is rather far from its understanding despite much work has been done in this field .",
    "the problems are directly related to the problems of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the approaches to soft hadronic processes are widely varied : regge  type , geometrical or qcd  inspired models consider aspects of such processes from the different points of view and use various ideas on hadron structure and interaction dynamics .",
    "the major part of the models consider the global characteristics of hadron interactions such as @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 related to large distance interaction dynamics as reflecting gross features of hadron structure @xcite , @xcite . despite of the difficulties in application of perturbative qcd for the description of long  distance interactions and their obvious nonperturbative character ,",
    "it is often possible to represent the high  energy amplitude in the various model approaches as an expansion over a small parameter which depends on the kinematics of the process , e.g. for the case of non  increasing total cross  section the general form of the amplitude is @xmath6^n\\exp \\left[\\frac{a(s)t}{n}\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is a small parameter at @xmath8 .    since the expansion is not valid for the rising total cross ",

    "by now the theoretical treatment of soft hadronic reactions involves substantial piece of phenomenology and uses various model approaches .",
    "they are often based on divergent postulates , but their phenomenological parts are similar . in particular , an amplitude @xmath13 is considered as an input for the subsequent unitarization procedure : @xmath14.\\ ] ] to reproduce the total cross  section rise the input amplitude @xmath13 is usually considered as a power function of energy .",
    "this function being taken as an amplitude itself violates unitarity in the direct channel . to obey unitarity in the direct channel",
    "an unitarization procedure should be used .",
    "there are several ways to restore unitarity of the scattering matrix .",
    "we consider two schemes : based on the use of eikonal and generalized reaction matrix respectively .",
    "there are also combined methods but those are not often used . as it was mentioned various models for @xmath13 may be successfully used to provide phenomenological description of high energy hadron scattering .",
    "however , in the particular model approaches the important dynamical aspects of interaction could be significantly obscured due to large number of free parameters .    in this paper",
    "we discuss some general properties of hadron scattering , the implications of unitarity and analyticity , in particular , manifestations of the antishadow scattering mode and respective model predictions for the observables in elastic scattering and diffraction dissociation .",
    "our main goal is to draw an attention to the existence of the antishadow scattering mode at the energies of lhc and vlhc .",
    "it might provide a new insight into the dynamics of diffraction and head - on hadronic collisions at superhigh energies .",
    "in the collisions of two high energy particles the de broglie wavelength can be short compared to the typical hadronic size and hence optical concepts may be used as useful guidelines .",
    "thus , the hadron scattering can be considered as a collision of two relativistically contracted objects of finite size .",
    "the relevant mathematical tool for description of high energy hadronic scattering is based on the impact parameter representation for the scattering amplitude . in the case of spinless particle scattering this representation",
    "has the following form : @xmath15 note that for the scattering of particles with non ",
    "zero spin the impact parameter representation for the helicity amplitudes has a similar form with substitution @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the net helicity change between the final and initial states .",
    "the impact parameter representation as it was shown in @xcite is valid for all physical energies and scattering angles .",
    "this representation provides simple semiclassical picture of hadron scattering .",
    "it is often assumed , after the chou ",
    "yang model was proposed , that the driving mechanism of hadron scattering is due to overlapping of the two matter distributions of colliding hadrons .",
    "it could be understood by analogy with glauber theory of nuclear interactions : one assumes that the matter density comes from the spatial distribution of hadron constituents and also assumes a zero  range interaction between those constituents .",
    "such contact interaction might result from the effective qcd , e.g. based on the nambu  jona - lasinio lagrangian .",
    "the important role in the geometrical approach belongs to the notion of the interaction radius .",
    "the general definition of the interaction radius which is in agreement with the above geometrical picture was given in @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the particle momentum in the c.m.s .",
    "the value for @xmath20 is chosen provided the contributions of the partial amplitudes from the angular momenta @xmath21 are vanishingly small .",
    "as a first approximation one can consider the energy independent interaction intensity and describe the elastic scattering amplitude in terms of the black disk model where it has the form : @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the interaction radius .",
    "the model is consistent with the observed structure in the differential cross  sections of @xmath2 and @xmath24scattering at @xmath9 close to 1 @xmath25 .    in the simplest case ,",
    "neglecting the real part and spin , the impact parameter amplitude @xmath26 can be obtained as an inverse transformation according to eq .",
    "[ imp ] with @xmath27 thus , one can extract information on the geometrical properties of interaction from the experimental data .",
    "the analysis of the experimental data on high  energy diffractive scattering shows that the effective interaction area expands with energy and the interaction intensity  opacity  increases with energy at fixed impact parameter @xmath28 . such analysis used to be carried out every time as the new experimental data become available .",
    "for example analysis of the data at the isr energies ( the most precise data set on differential cross ",
    "section for wide @xmath9range available for @xmath29 gev ) shows that one can observe a central impact parameter profile with a tail from the higher partial waves and some suppression ( compared to gaussian ) of low partial waves .",
    "the scattering picture at such energies is close to gray disk with smooth edge which is getting darker in its center with energy .    beside the above simple geometrical observations it is useful to keep in mind the rigorous bounds for the experimental observables .",
    "bounds for the observables obtained on the firm ground of general principles such as unitarity and analyticity are very important for any phenomenological analysis of soft interactions . however , there are only few results obtained on the basis of the axiomatic field theory .",
    "first of all it is the froissart  martin bound that gives the upper limit for the total cross  section : @xmath30 where @xmath31 @xmath32 mb ) and @xmath33 is the pion mass .",
    "saturation of this bound , as it is suggested by the existing experimental data , imply the dominance of long  distance dynamics .",
    "it also leads to number of important consequences for the other observables .",
    "for instance , unitarity leads to the following bound for elastic cross  section : @xmath34    therefore , when the total cross  section asymptotically increases as @xmath35 , elastic cross  section also must rise like @xmath35 .",
    "it is important to note here that there is no similar bound for the inelastic cross  section and as we will see further the absence of such bound allows for appearance of the antishadow scattering mode at very high energies .    if one considers a more general case when @xmath36 , then at asymptotic energies one should have @xmath37 and @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the total cross  sections of the processes @xmath41 and @xmath42 correspondingly . in the case of @xmath43 the total cross  section difference of antiparticle and particle interactions should obey the following inequality @xmath44    contrary to the total cross  section behavior , the existing experimental data seem to prefer decreasing @xmath45 .",
    "possible deviations from such behavior could be expected on the basis of perturbative qcd @xcite and it was one of the reasons for the recent discussions on the pomeron counterpart  the odderon .",
    "however , the recent measurements real to imaginary part ratio for forward @xmath24 scattering provide little support for the odderon .",
    "we will not discuss more thoroughly the interesting problem of @xmath46 ratio and will consider for simplicity the case of pure imaginary amplitude .",
    "for the slope of diffraction cone at @xmath47 in the case of a pure imaginary scattering amplitude the following inequality takes place : @xmath48 which means that when the total cross  section increases as @xmath35 , the same dependence is mandatory for the slope of diffraction cone .",
    "it is the stronger shrinkage than the regge model predicts : @xmath49 .",
    "there is also bound @xcite for the total cross  section of single diffractive processes .",
    "it was obtained by pumplin in approach where inelastic diffraction as well as elastic scattering are assumed to arise in form of a shadow of inelastic processes and has the form @xmath50 the most significant assumption was that the diffractive eigenamplitudes in the good  walker @xcite picture do not exceed the black disk limit .    at this point",
    "some details of the experimental situation have to be mentioned . at the highest energies the experimental data for the total and elastic cross  sections , slope parameter of diffraction cone and cross  section of single inelastic diffraction dissociation",
    "have been obtained in @xmath24collisions at fermilab .",
    "in particular , those measurements show that    * the rise of the total cross  section of @xmath51interactions is consistent with @xmath35dependence , however other dependencies are not ruled out ; * elastic cross  section rises faster that the inelastic and total cross - sections and has a magnitude about 1/4 of the total cross - section .    comparing the value of the elastic to total cross - section ratio with the lower energy data",
    "one can conclude that the higher the energy , the higher both absolute and relative probabilities of elastic collisions .",
    "impact parameter analysis @xcite of the data shows that the scattering amplitude is probably beyond the black disk limit @xmath52 in head - on collisions .",
    "the pumplin bound ( eq . [ pmb ] ) is also violated in such collisions and this is not surprising if one recollects the original ad hoc assumption on the shadow scattering mode .",
    "the basic role in our consideration belongs to unitarity of the scattering matrix @xmath53 which is a reformulation of the probability conservation . in the impact parameter representation",
    "the unitarity equation rewritten for the elastic scattering amplitude @xmath26 at high energies has the form @xmath54 where the inelastic overlap function @xmath55 is the sum of all inelastic channel contributions .",
    "it can be expressed as a sum of @xmath56particle production cross ",

    "however , it does not mean that the eikonal model itself is in trouble .",
    "in particular , the account for fluctuations of the eikonal @xcite strongly modifies the structure of the amplitude and reduces it to algebraic form which is similar to that used in the unitarization scheme based on the generalized reaction matrix .",
    "the latter method is based on the relativistic generalization of the heitler equation of radiation dumping@xcite . in this approach",
    "the elastic scattering amplitude satisfies unitarity equation since it is constructed as a solution of the following equation @xcite @xmath73 presented here in the operator form .",

    "the form of the amplitude in the impact parameter representation is the following : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the generalized reaction matrix , which is considered as an input dynamical quantity similar to eikonal function .",

    "for example , the regge  pole approach @xcite provides the following form for the @xmath78matrix : @xmath79,\\quad a(s)\\sim \\alpha ' \\ln s , \\label{eb2}\\ ] ] while the chiral quark model which will be discussed below gives the exponential @xmath28dependence @xmath80,\\label{eb1}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the constant proportional to the masses of the constituent quarks .",
    "we have mentioned here only the gross features of those model parameterizations without going into the details .",
    "the both parameterizations lead to @xmath35 rise of the total and elastic cross  sections and slope parameter @xmath82 : @xmath83 at @xmath84 .",
    "the above results are similar to conclusions of eikonal unitarization .    however , these two unitarization schemes lead to different predictions for the inelastic cross  sections and for the ratio of elastic to total cross - section .",
    "this ratio in the @xmath78matrix unitarization scheme reaches its maximal possible value at @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath85 which reflects in fact that the bound for the partial ",

    "when the amplitude exceeds the black disk limit ( in central collisions at high energies ) then the scattering at such impact parameters turns out to be of an antishadow nature .",

    "universality of such preasymptotic behavior agrees with the experiment .",

    "it should be taken with certain caution .",
    "studies of soft interactions at the highest energies can lead to the discoveries of fundamental importance .",
    "the genesis of hadron scattering with rising energy can be described as transition from the grey to black disk and eventually to black ring with the antishadow scattering mode in the center .",

    "its existence can be correlated with the new phenomena expected at high energies in the central hadronic collisions .",

    "what are the particular correlations between those phenomena and the antishadow scattering ?",
    "the answer can be obtained in the nonperturbative qcd studies and in the experiments devoted to studies of soft processes at lhc and vlhc .",
