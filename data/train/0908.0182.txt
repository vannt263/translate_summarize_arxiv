    "short bursts of gamma rays above 100  mev and with duration less than a few @xmath0s might be produced by pulsars  @xcite , by explosions of primordial black holes  @xcite , or via some as - yet undiscovered mechanism , for example during hard gamma - ray bursts .",
    "the crab pulsar was discovered by occasional outbursts of giant radio pulses ( grp )  @xcite .",
    "the period of the crab pulsar is 33  ms and the pulse profile features two dominant pulses called the main and inter - pulse .",
    "grps have been detected only during those phases  @xcite .",
    "the intensity of grps is variable and can reach orders of magnitude over the average period - integrated flux .",
    "it is interesting to note that the duration of grps also shows extreme variability , lasting between 2  ns and about 1  @xmath0s above 5  ghz  @xcite .",
    "enhanced optical emission during grps has been reported by  @xcite , but no such correlation has been found at higher energies  @xcite . it has been proposed that @xmath130  gev gamma rays may be produced by curvature radiation during periods of grps  @xcite .    motivated by the extreme variability of grps and the prediction for 30  gev gamma rays at a fluence level detectable by imaging atmospheric - cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) , we searched archival data from the very energetic radiation imaging telescope array system ( veritas )  @xcite and the short gamma ray front air cherenkov experiment ( sgarface )  @xcite for burst - like events .",
    "the analysis and upper limits over a range of burst durations and photon energies are given below .",
    "bursts of nearly simultaneous gamma rays above 100  mev can be detected by their secondary cherenkov radiation in the atmosphere using ground - based optical telescopes .",
    "sgarface piggy - backs on the whipple 10  m imaging atmospheric - cherenkov telescope  @xcite to search for such bursts . to eliminate cosmic - ray background events that mimic the expected image parameters of bursts , we search for correlations with veritas .",
    "veritas is one of the most sensitive arrays of atmospheric - cherenkov telescopes and is located about 7  km from the sgarface experiment .",
    "bursts of gamma rays would appear identical to both instruments , while cosmic rays would not be detected simultaneously and produe different image paramters .",
    "the whipple 10  m telescope is located at 31.6804@xmath2  latitude , 110.8790@xmath2  w longitude , and 2312  m a.s.l .",
    "the camera of the whipple 10  m telescope consists of 379 close - packed pmts covering a 2.4@xmath2  field of view .",
    "the pmt signals for sgarface are split off the whipple 10  m signal cables via passive couplers .",
    "to reduce the cost and complexity of the sgarface system , clusters of seven nearest - neighbor pixels are summed into 55 channels , each viewing @xmath10.36@xmath2  of the sky .",
    "this pixelation is sufficient to image the extended cherenkov images produced by bursts of gamma rays .",
    "the channels are sampled by flash analog - to - digital ( fadc ) converters at an interval of 20  ns and with memory depth of 35.04 @xmath0s ( 1752 samples ) .",
    "the fadc input was designed with a time - constant of about 25 ns to preserve the accumulated charge between samples .",
    "sgarface achieves a high level of background rejection of cosmic rays and atmospheric phenomena through time - resolved imaging .",
    "the sgarface trigger consists of two systems : a multi - time - scale discriminator ( mtd ) and a pattern - sensitive logic .",
    "the mtd integrates the signal on six time scales : 60 ns , 180 ns , 540 ns , 1620 ns , 4860 ns , and 14580 ns .",
    "the trigger threshold requirement is tested at three equally spaced time intervals during the trigger window , requiring pulses to be at least as long as the trigger window .",
    "the thresholds were set conservatively above the night - sky background and occasionally adjusted to reflect changes in the telescope throughput .",
    "the pattern - sensitive coincidence logic determines if a sufficient number of nearest neighbor channels have triggered the mtd . due to the broad angular extent of images produced by bursts of gamma rays ,",
    "all observations were taken with the trigger requiring 7 nearest - neighbor pixels above threshold . in turn",
    ", this requirement reduces triggers by the narrower gamma - ray and cosmic - ray initiated showers .",
    "once an event triggers , the 55 fadc memories are read out after a 16.28 @xmath0s delay .    the fluence sensitivity for a range of burst durations and photon energies",
    "was determined with monte carlo simulations .",
    "the sensitivity of veritas to bursts of gamma rays is set by the single photo - multiplier tube ( pmt ) trigger threshold of @xmath15 photo - electrons5.1 photoelectrons . ] .",
    "three nearest - neighbor pmts , each viewing 0.15@xmath2  of the sky , are required to exceed this threshold within 7  ns of each other .",
    "the number of photoelectrons produced per cherenkov photon is 0.14 ; this was determined by folding the simulated cherenkov photon spectrum with the measured mirror reflectivity and the pmt quantum efficiency .",
    "the angular distribution of cherenkov light was simulated for a burst of 1  gev gamma rays with fluence of 2  @xmath3/m@xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : veritas_distribution ] ) . combining this with the mirror area of @xmath195  m@xmath4 results in a minimum fluence required for the telescope to trigger of 0.02  @xmath3/m@xmath4 during 7  ns .",
    "the sensitivity to bursts of duration , @xmath5 , decreases as @xmath6 .",
    "[ fig : veritas_sgarface ] shows the minimum required fluence of a burst of 1  gev gamma rays so that it is detected by veritas .",
    "the size of the solid angle corresponds to the effective pmt cathode area over which 100% efficiency would be achieved .",
    "the x - axis is perpendicular to the earth s magnetic field . _",
    "lower figure : _ the _ solid _ line shows the cherenkov photon distribution along the x - axis , the _ dashed _ line along the y - axis . , width=240 ]    for sgarface , a detailed simulation was carried out that includes the measured single photo - electron probability distribution  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : sensitivity ] . the space borne gamma - ray instrument _",
    "fermi _ has good sensitivity to gamma rays above 0.03  gev .",
    "we note that in order to detect a burst of gamma rays with _ fermi _ , a fluence of at least a few @xmath3/m@xmath4 would be required .",
    "the time scale for burst detection with _ fermi _ is limited to less than 1  @xmath0s for detection of multiple photons in a single event , and to greater than 26  @xmath0s because of instrument dead time .",
    "coincident observations of the crab with sgarface and veritas have been carried out since october 2007 for a total of 6.3  hours taken under clear , dark skies and at telescope elevation above 60@xmath2 .",
    "sgarface data were analyzed as described in  @xcite .",
    "briefly , the image shape and pixel timing are parameterized and events are then selected based on comparison to monte carlo simulations of bursts of gamma rays .",
    "the only difference from the cuts used in  @xcite is that the brightest pixel was not required to be below the fadc saturation level of @xmath1230 digital counts .",
    "a 98% rejection efficiency of background from cosmic rays and atmospheric phenomena is achieved by this analysis .",
    "[ fig : distance ] shows the sgarface point spread function for bursts of gamma rays between 100  mev and 10  gev and with duration between 10  ns and 15  @xmath0s .",
    "all events should fall within 0.1@xmath2  from the true source location . including the systematic telescope pointing error of 0.085@xmath2 , the reconstructed burst direction is required to lie within 0.2@xmath2of the crab .",
    "a histogram of the event durations measured by sgarface is shown in fig .",

    "+            no simultaneous events were found between sgarface and veritas .",

    "the 99% upper limit on the true rate of bursts is 0.73  hour@xmath8 , assuming a poisson distribution .",
    "this upper limit is conservative beyond 100  ns because sgarface is more sensitive than veritas , and no events longer than 100  ns were identified by sgarface .",

    "individual bursts of gamma rays from the crab above 100  mev can be detected with sgarface and veritas .",

    "the search was motivated by a prediction for @xmath130  gev photons from curvature radiation produced during grps  @xcite .",
    "though the predicted fluence is a factor of @xmath12 below that achieved with this search , considerable uncertainty is involved in modeling the environment of the crab pulsar .",
