    "following a number of groundbreaking experiments with ultracold atomic systems  @xcite , the problem of thermalization of exactly solvable quantum many - body systems has attracted a great deal of attention  @xcite .",
    "this is because it relates to fairly fundamental questions , such as the emergence of thermodynamics in isolated systems prepared in initial states that are not eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( i.e. systems undergoing a so - called ` quantum quench ' ) .",
    "the latter subject has deep ramifications , both in condensed matter physics  @xcite and cosmology  @xcite . moreover , this problem is also relevant to the ongoing efforts to build ` quantum emulators ' , that is , tunable quantum systems capable of accurately simulating the mathematical models of many body physics . in this regard ,",
    "the problem of thermalization impacts on questions such like how much memory will the emulator retain of its initial conditions and whether the standard gibbsian ensembles can be used to predict the outcome of the simulation  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it was first conjectured by rigol and coworkers  @xcite that the steady state of simple few - body observables of integrable systems following a quantum quench can be described by a generalized gibbs ensemble ( gge ) .",
    "the density matrix of the gge is obtained as the less biased guess  @xcite of the steady state given the constraints on the dynamics stemming from the existing set of non - trivial integrals of motion .",
    "surprisingly , it was found that , in order to reproduce few body observables , only a subset of the order of @xmath0 ( where @xmath0 is the system size ) of simple integrals of motion is needed  @xcite .    concerning the general applicability of the gge , there has been also some debate  @xcite about the importance for thermalization of the locality of the operators in the basis of eigenmodes of the system .",
    "for the quantum ising chain , it was recently shown analytically that correlation functions of nonlocal operators also thermalize to the gge  @xcite .",
    "similar results had been found earlier for the luttinger  @xcite and sine - gordon models  @xcite .",
    "however , the reason why the gge has been so successful in explaining the steady - state correlations in very diverse models has remained rather obscure . for local operators in certain integrable field theories , solid arguments in favor of the validity of the gge have been put forward by fioretto and mussardo  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , cassidy and coworkers  @xcite recently introduced a generalization of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ( eth )  @xcite for integrable systems .",
    "previously , the eth has been successfully used to understand thermalization in non - integrable systems  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we describe a general method to demonstrate the applicability of the gge in exactly solvable models for a general class of initial states",
    ". our method does not require the explicit evaluation of correlation functions at asymptotically long times after the quench .",
    "instead , it suffices to show that the asymptotic correlation functions of ( either local or nonlocal ) operators depend only on the expectation values of quasi - particle occupation operators in the initial state .",
    "this property , together with certain properties of the class of initial states considered in this work  @xcite , allows to demonstrate that each eigenmode of the system is subject to a ( mode ) dependent effective temperature , the latter being nothing but a restatement of the gge conjecture .",
    "this new point of view on the gge also explains some of the less well understood aspects of the conjecture that have been briefly mentioned above . as a matter of fact",
    ", it explains why the only set of integrals of motion that are needed to construct the gge correspond to the quasi - particle occupation operators . for the class of exactly solvable models discussed below",
    ", the latter are a minimal set of @xmath0 integrals of motion that entirely determine the asypmtotic correlations .",
    "the fact that the asymptotic correlation functions depend only on the expectation value of these non - trivial integrals of motion means that the system remembers much more information about its initial conditions than it is the case in systems exhibiting thermalization to a standard gibbs ensemble . for the latter , only the expectation value of the energy and",
    "the hamiltonian suffice to determine the effective temperature and chemical potential of the standard gibbs ensemble describing thermal equilibrium of systems in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the lack of relaxation of correlation functions to thermal equilibrium found in this work bears a strong resemblance with the nonergodicity of the magnetization in the xy model discussed several decades ago by mccoy  @xcite and mazur  @xcite ( see  @xcite for a recent review of this result ) . thus , we shall call this behavior of the asymptotic correlations ` nonergodic '",
    ".    our goal in this article will be to illustrate our method to demonstrate the applicability of the gge by applying it to several models that have been previously analyzed either analytically  @xcite or numerically  @xcite : the quantum ising chain ( cf .",
    "[ sec : qi ] ) , the luttinger model ( cf .",
    "[ sec : lm ] ) , and the lattice gas of hard - core bosons in one dimension or quantum xx spin chain ( cf .",
    "[ sec : xxchain ] ) . in the former two cases ,",
    "we consider a quench from an initial state that does not break the ( lattice ) translational invariance and it is therefore conceptually simpler . in sec .",
    "[ sec : xxchain ] , we turn to a the more involved case in which the initial state is not translationally invariant but conserve the particle number . in our analysis , we shall consider correlations of both local and nonlocal operators , demonstrating , for a broad class of initial states , that in both cases thermalization to the gge takes place .",
    "we also consider a more general type of initial states that those that have been investigated in the past  @xcite .",
    "we have relegated to the appendices the discussion of some of the most technical aspects of this work .",
    "let us begin with an precise statement of the problem that we intend to address .",
    "a quantum quench refers to the situation in which a system is prepared at @xmath1 in an initial state ( denoted @xmath2 below ) that is not an eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , we shall assume that , following the quench , the system reached some kind of equilibrated state where observables and correlation functions acquire ( time - averaged ) values about which they exhibit small temporal fluctuations ( cf .",
    "[ fig : corrplot3 ] ) . a necessary condition for this equilibration to occur",
    "is that if we expand @xmath2 in the basis of eigenstates of @xmath3 , @xmath4 the coefficients @xmath5 are sufficiently nonsparse on the basis of eigenstates of @xmath3 such that ( for a sufficiently large system ) unitary evolution can lead to a steady state as a result of dephasing between the contributions of many different eigenstates to the expectation value of observables and correlation functions .",
    "the general conditions for equilibration have been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we next begin our investigation of quantum quenches in exactly solvable models by considering the quantum ising chain . for this system , the hamiltonian that describes the time - evolution of the system following the initial state preparation takes the form : @xmath6\\label{eq : hamqi}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the pauli matrices at site @xmath9 and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the model parameters . as reviewed in appendix  [ app : eigmodes ] , the hamiltonian in eq .",

    "the operators @xmath15 are the eigenmodes of the system for the set of parameters @xmath16 .",
    "they evolve according to the law : @xmath17 . however , the actual observables of the system correspond to the pauli matrices , @xmath18 and @xmath18 .",
    "for example ( cf .",
    "appendix  [ app : eigmodes ] ) , @xmath19 where @xmath20\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 and @xmath23 , such that e.g. @xmath24 .",
    "the class of initial states with which we shall be concerned in what follows is described by a density matrix @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a normalization constant and the operator @xmath27 is a quadratic form of the eigenmode operators @xmath15 and @xmath28 ( cf .",
    ".  [ eq : initstate ] ) .",
    "since @xmath27 must be hermitian , it can be interpreted as the hamiltonian of the system at time @xmath29 , and the parameter @xmath30 as the absolute temperature of an energy reservoir with which the system was in contact ( the pure state case is obtained by taking @xmath31 ) .",
    "the contact with the reservoir is removed at @xmath32 as the hamiltonian is suddenly changed from @xmath27 to @xmath3 and the system allowed to evolve unitarily .",
    "this defines the kind of quantum quench that has been analyzed in most cases so far  @xcite .",
    "thus , the most general form for the initial hamiltonian @xmath27 reads : @xmath33   \\gamma^{\\dag}(k ) \\gamma(k^{\\prime } ) \\\\",
    "+ \\sum_{k , k^{\\prime } } \\left [   \\delta^*_0(k , k ) \\gamma(k)\\gamma(k^{\\prime } ) + \\delta_0(k , k^{\\prime } ) \\gamma^{\\dag}(k^{\\prime } ) \\gamma^{\\dag}(k ) \\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq : initstate}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the term proportional to @xmath34 in eq .   can be interpreted as a scattering potential that is switched off at @xmath32 .",
    "the presence of the scattering potential in @xmath27 means that , in general , the initial state , @xmath2 , breaks the translational invariance of the lattice .",
    "furthermore , the last two terms in eq .   imply that that the number of fermion quasi - particles is not well defined in the initial state because @xmath35 \\neq 0 $ ] , where @xmath36 is the quasi - particle number operator .",
    "the states introduced above have two important properties : _ i _ ) correlations of products of an arbitrary ( even ) number of fermi operators like @xmath15 , @xmath28 , or @xmath37 and @xmath38 , can be expressed in terms of products of correlation functions of bilinear operators like @xmath39 , @xmath40 , etc .",
    "this result is known as wick s ( or more precisely , bloch - de dominicis  @xcite ) theorem and it is needed to show that the correlation functions of nonlocal operators can be obtained from those of local operators ( see below and appendix  [ app : wick ] ) ; _ ii _ ) for any partition of the eigemodes into two disjoint subsets @xmath41 ( called `` system '' in what follows ) and @xmath42 ( called `` environment '' ) , the reduced density matrix obtained by tracing out the environment b can be also written as the exponential of a quadratic form of the fermi operators @xmath15 and @xmath28  @xcite . in particular , if the `` system '' a consists of a single eigenmode ( and therefore @xmath42 contains the remaining @xmath43 modes ) , the reduced density matrix @xmath44 where the symbol @xmath45 stands for the partial trace over all modes but @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the quasi - particle occupation operator .",
    "this result applies to systems with eigenmodes obeying both fermi and bose statistics  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the gge density matrix is constructed as the direct product of these single - mode reduced density matrices : @xmath48 which is nothing but the mathematical statement that each mode is subject to a mode - dependent effective temperature @xmath49 . in fact , our method to prove the applicability of the gge will rely on this interpretation of the gge .",
    "in order to make contact with previous studies of the quantum ising chain  @xcite , we shall analyze the following the case of an initial state that respects the lattice translation symmetry .",
    "this requires that @xmath50 and @xmath51 . for specific choices of @xmath52 and @xmath53 such that @xmath54 , with @xmath55 , @xmath27 would correspond to the hamiltonian of the quatum ising chain at a different value of the parameter @xmath56 . at such point , @xmath57 ,",
    "is the dispersion of the quasi - particles which are described by a different set of eigenmodes related to @xmath15 and @xmath28 by a canonical transformation parametrized by the angle @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "thus , for such a choice we can speak of a quench in the parameter @xmath11 .",
    "however , for arbitrary @xmath52 and @xmath53 , @xmath27 does not map to a quantum ising chain hamiltonian , and therefore , our choice of the initial state of the quench , albeit translationally invariant , is more general than previous choices  @xcite , which focused on quenching the parameter @xmath11 only .",
    "we next turn to the correlation functions of the model following the quench .",
    "we begin with the discussion of the correlation function for a local operator such like the fermi field : @xmath59t/\\hbar }   \\langle \\gamma^{\\dag}(k ) \\gamma(k^{\\prime } ) \\rangle \\right . \\notag\\\\ & \\left .",

    "note that @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which is itself a function of @xmath52 and @xmath53 are assumed to be well behaved , smooth functions of @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , it follows , by virtue of the riemann - lebesgue lemma , that the second term in the right hand side of eq .",

    "hence , for each term of the sum over @xmath46 , we can use the second of the properties of the class of states @xmath2 described above , namely , we can trace out all the modes @xmath75 and write @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is given in eq .",

    "we merely state here the results : @xmath82 .",
    "\\qquad \\label{eq : dab}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again we find that the asymptotic correlation functions are nonergodic , as they only depend on @xmath83 .    using the above results , we are now in a position to discuss the correlations of a nonlocal operator such as @xmath18 .",
    "nonlocal means that this operator does not reduce to a simple linear combination of the eigenmode operators @xmath15 and @xmath28 . indeed ( cf .",

    "the existence of the @xmath66 limit of those correlation functions ( cf .",

    "<S> the generalized gibbs ensemble introduced for describing few body correlations in exactly solvable systems following a quantum quench is related to the nonergodic way in which operators sample , in the limit of infinite time after the quench , the quantum correlations present in the initial state . </S>",
    "<S> the nonergodicity of the correlations is thus shown _ analytically _ to imply the equivalence with the generalized gibbs ensemble for quantum ising and xx spin chains as well as for the luttinger model the thermodynamic limit , and for a broad class of initial states and correlation functions of both local and nonlocal operators . </S>"
