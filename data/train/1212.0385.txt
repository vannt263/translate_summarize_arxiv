    "the radiative energy loss is expected to be proportional to the qcd casimir coupling factor between the hard parton and the gluons of the medium  @xcite .",
    "light - quarks should then lose less energy than gluons due to their color charge .",
    "in addition , due to their large mass , gluon - bremsstrahlung from heavy - quarks should be suppressed at small angles as a consequence of destructive quantum interferences  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if heavy quarks hadronize in the medium or if they re - interact strongly with it , heavy - flavor hadrons should inherit the medium azimuthal anisotropy .",
    "finally , if in - medium hadronization is the predominant mechanism at low momentum , the relative production of strange over non - strange charmed hadrons should be enhanced  @xcite .",

    "the inner tracking system ( its ) and the time projection chamber ( tpc ) provides track reconstruction from very low ( @xmath10 ) up to fairly high ( @xmath11 ) transverse momentum with a momentum resolution better than @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "the good impact parameter ( distance of closest approach of the track to the primary interaction vertex ) resolution , better than 65  @xmath14 m for @xmath15 in the bending plane in  collisions , allows the reconstruction of secondary decay vertices , making possible the direct reconstruction of charmed hadrons and the measurement of beauty decay electrons .",
    "charged hadrons are separated using the particle specific energy deposit ( d@xmath16/d@xmath17 ) in the tpc and the timing in the time of flight ( tof ) detector .",
    "electron identification ( i d ) is performed via the information provided by the tpc and tof for @xmath18 , while the transition radiation detector ( trd ) and electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal ) contribute to electron i d for @xmath19@xmath20 .",
    "the muon spectrometer is equipped with a dipole magnet providing a magnetic field of up to 0.7  t , and is responsible for muon tracking and identification . from the vertex region to the outer part it is composed of a 10 interaction length passive absorber , a beam shield , five stations of cathode pad chambers ( tracking stations ) , an iron wall , and two stations of resistive plate chambers ( trigger stations ) .",

    "one is based on the lifetime of beauty hadrons ( @xmath33 m ) , and explores the separation of their decay electrons from the primary interaction vertex ( ip ) by cutting on their impact parameter distribution  @xcite .",
    "the other method consists on studying the azimuthal correlations of electrons and charged hadrons , particularly the near side region , whose width is larger for beauty than charm hadron decays due to the decay kinematics .    [",

    "the pp  reference was obtained by a pqcd - driven @xmath52-scaling of the pp  cross sections at @xmath6  tev .",
