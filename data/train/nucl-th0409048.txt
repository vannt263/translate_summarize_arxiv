    "much of the understanding of atomic nuclei is based on the assumption that nucleons move , independently from each other , in the average potential created by the interaction with all other nucleons . a more fundamental approach to the understanding of nuclei",
    "has to start from the underlying nucleon - nucleon ( n - n ) interaction .",
    "realistic models of the n - n interaction exhibit a strongly repulsive central interaction at small inter - nucleon distances and a strong tensor component .",
    "these features lead to properties of nuclear wave functions that are beyond what is describable in terms of independent particle ( ip ) motion .",
    "in particular , strong short - range correlations ( src ) are expected to occur .",
    "the effects of the short - range correlations are known for systems where an accurate solution of the schrdinger equation for a realistic n - n interaction can be obtained @xcite",
    ". very light nuclei ( today up to a@xmath010 ) and infinite nuclear matter are amongst the systems where this is feasible @xcite .",
    "the corresponding calculations show that in a microscopic description of nuclear systems the short - range and tensor parts of the n - n interaction have a very important , not to say dominating , influence without which not even nuclear binding can be explained .    due to these short - range correlations",
    "the momentum distributions of nucleons acquire a tail extending to very high momenta @xmath1 and part of the strength , located in ip descriptions at low excitation energy @xmath2 , is moved to very high excitation energies .    in the past",
    ", most experimental investigations were confined to rather low momenta and energies , _",
    "i.e. _ to the region where the strength is dominated ( but not entirely given ) by the ip properties . in this region",
    ", the consequences of short - range correlations are indicated primarily by a _ depopulation _ of states in comparison to the predictions of ip models ( including the long - range correlations which can be described by configuration mixing ) . according to the calculations mentioned above",
    ", a depopulation of the order of 20% is expected .",
    "> from the experimental information available up to now , the depopulation of ip strength at low @xmath3 is established @xcite ( for a caveat see below ) .",
    "much less is known from a _ direct _ measurement of the strength of the spectral function @xmath4 at large @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",

    "this correlated strength has always been discussed in @xmath3-space where ( part of ) it can be separated from the ip strength . in this rapid communication , we take an orthogonal look at the correlated strength and discuss it in coordinate space ( r - space ) .",
    "we address this question from both the theory and experiment side .",
    "the trigger for this study lies in difficulties experienced in the past in interpreting data in terms of ip models .",
    "for example , fits with ip wavefunctions of the nuclear charge density often yielded form factors ( of ip dominated transitions ) with incorrect @xmath5-dependence .",
    "fits with ip wave functions also have difficulties to reproduce the total densities in the nuclear interior .",
    "the origin of these difficulties : total densities have contributions from correlated nucleons that do not appear in observables dominated by quasi - particle properties .",
    "the correlated nucleons presumably have a different radial distribution .",
    "the goal of this paper is to derive quasi - particle ( qp ) and correlated distributions in r - space using greens - function theory .",
    "we compare the results to the correlated density in r - space which we obtain from the difference of the density  known from elastic electron scattering  and the qp contributions known from ( e , ep ) reactions .    as a side - product",
    ", this study also sheds light on a recently uncovered problem with qp occupation numbers derived from ( e , ep ) experiments with low and high @xmath5 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the evaluation of the single - particle spectral functions for @xmath6 , the nucleus we use for our study , has been performed within the framework of the green s function method @xcite using the techniques described in @xcite .",
    "the nucleon self - energy @xmath7 is determined in a discrete basis of bessel functions @xmath8 with appropriate boundary conditions at the surface of a spherical box with radius @xmath9 .",
    "these basis states are identified by the angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath10 and @xmath11 and a radial quantum number ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) referring to the momentum . for a box radius @xmath9 of typically 20 fm",
    ", it turns out to be sufficient to include around 60 basis states for each partial wave .",
    "the self - energy contains a hartree - fock contribution @xmath14 calculated in terms of a nuclear matter @xmath15-matrix plus complex correction terms , @xmath16 , which account for the inclusion of two - particle one - hole and two - hole one - particle contributions .",
    "these correction terms are calculated directly for the finite nucleus @xmath6 , describing the intermediate particle states by plane waves orthogonalized with respect to the occupied hole states .",
    "this is a good approximation to describe the effects of src , however , it tends to underestimate the spectral strength due to long - range correlations at missing energies slightly above the two - hole one - particle threshold .",
    "the single - particle green s function is determined from this self - energy @xmath17 by solving the dyson equation in the box basis described above .",
    "from the imaginary part of this green s function one can calculate the spectral function in this basis @xcite or determine it in configuration space by the transformation s_lj(r , r;e ) = _ m , n _",

    "we have assigned the label @xmath22 to the part of the single - particle density , which originates from the continuum part of the spectral function to indicate that this correlated density is absent in the ip model .",

    "one also should note that , contrary to what one naively could expect , the strength in the higher @xmath10 states does not contribute at large @xmath27 ; the corresponding large values of @xmath2 pull the radial wave functions to lower @xmath27 .",

    "some data have been taken at large @xmath5 mainly in connection with the determination of nuclear transparencies for high - energy protons .",
    "the low-@xmath5 data , taken with good energy- and momentum resolution mainly at nikhef and saclay , have been analyzed in the framework of dwba using optical potentials known from proton - carbon scattering .",
    "the qp radial wave functions have been parameterized using woods - saxon ( ws ) potentials .",
    "_ @xcite have made a coherent analysis of the entire data set .",
    "the occupation of the qp orbits , obtained by summing the experimental spectroscopic factors , turns out to be rather low in comparison to what is known for other nuclei @xcite ; the summed 1p plus 1s strength amounts to 3.4 protons only ( 56% occupation ) .",
    "the high-@xmath5 data , determined in part with moderate energy- and momentum resolution , were taken mainly at slac and jlab .",
    "the data were summed over a large region of initial momentum @xmath1 and removal energy @xmath2 , and fitted using ws radial wave functions and theoretical transparencies . when using the most reliable transparencies , confirmed by other experiments , lapikas _ et al .",
    "_ found a much higher occupancy of the qp orbits , 5.0 - 5.6 protons ( @xmath3387% occupation ) .",
    "this discrepancy  which is very embarrassing to the practitioners of ( e , ep ) as it sheds serious doubts on the quantitative interpretation of ( e , ep ) data  obviously needs to be better understood , and is discussed in more detail below .",
    "this difference also has led to speculations about @xmath5-dependent qp - occupations , for which we see no physical basis .",
    "a partial reason for the difference between the low-@xmath5 and high-@xmath5 results is immediately clear : the low-@xmath5 data cover the region of missing momenta of typically @xmath35180mev / c and missing energy @xmath2 @xmath3550mev , the high-@xmath5 data extend to 300mev / c .",
    "the high-@xmath5 data also cover a larger range in missing energy , they are integrated up to typically 80mev . in this larger @xmath3-range ,",
    "there is not only qp strength , but also a fraction of the correlated strength is integrated over . before making a valid comparison",
    ", this correlated strength needs to be removed .    in order to correct for this effect , we start from the high-@xmath5 ( e , ep ) data taken in a recent jlab experiment @xcite in quasi - elastic kinematics , which minimize final state interactions fsi and meson exchange current contributions mec . this experiment yields , in agreement with the previous jlab and slac experiments , 5.2 protons in the integration region e@xmath3580mev , k@xmath35300mev / c . this number we correct for the continuum contribution using the calculated spectral function discussed above . with this correction",
    "the discrepancy between the low-@xmath5 and high-@xmath5 results is significantly reduced ; the qp occupations now are 3.4 _ vs _ 4.5 protons for the low-@xmath5/high-@xmath5 data , respectively . given the uncertainties of these numbers  believed to perhaps 10%  there still is a worrisome incompatibility .    in order to proceed",
    ", we have to choose .",
    "we have decided to use the occupation coming from the high-@xmath5 measurements , as we judge the interpretation of these data to be more safe .",
    "the low-@xmath5 data suffer from uncertainties in the treatment of the final state interaction .",
    "due to the low energies of the outgoing proton ( 70mev for the nikhef data @xcite ) coupled channel effects not treated in the usual dwba analysis should be relevant .",
    "van der steenhoven _",
    "et al _ @xcite have shown that inclusion of these effects would increase , for the rather soft nucleus @xmath6 , the qp occupation by @xmath3320% .",
    "for the kinematics of the low-@xmath5 experiments , the calculations of boffi _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite also predict significant mec effects that would lead to a further increase of the qp occupation .",
    "the value for the qp occupation deduced from the high-@xmath5 measurement is also compatible with the correlated strength measured directly in the recent experiment by rohe _",
    "this measurement agrees with theoretical predictions for the correlated strength of @xmath3320% . the summed qp strength from the low-@xmath5 ( e , ep ) data ( which thus includes the fragmentation due to long - range correlations ) ,",
    "on the other hand , would correspond to @xmath3640% correlated strength , _",
    "i.e. _ be unrealistically high .",
    "furthermore , as we will see below , our choice of the qp occupation is confirmed by a consistency check in our analysis .    before proceeding to the calculation of the qp density , one more effect of correlations",
    "must be removed from the results of lapikas _",
    "et al_. while the p - strength is located in discrete states where no ambiguity occurs , the s - strength is located in the continuum between 20 and @xmath3350 mev removal energy . in this region ,",
    "also the correlated strength contributes , and affects the _ shape _ of the fitted ws momentum distribution .",
    "the correlated strength has a momentum distribution that falls much more slowly with increasing @xmath1 than the 1s qp strength ; when fitting the sum with a ws parameterization , the resulting ws momentum distribution extends somewhat too far in momentum , _ i.e. _ it would have too small a radial extension in @xmath27-space .",
    "we have used the theoretical 1s qp and correlated strength in the region used in @xcite for the determination of the 1s momentum distribution to calculate a correction to the ws parameterization fitted to the sum .",
    "we find that the extent of the wave function in k - space needs to be reduced by 11% .",
    "this modified ws - shape has been confirmed @xcite by an independent analysis employing the recent jlab data of @xcite and the correlated spectral function of @xcite .    with these qp radial wave functions , and occupations renormalized to the one",
    "derived above from the high-@xmath5 experiments , we can compute the qp density in @xmath27-space . as the radial wave functions fitted by lapikas _",

    "[ rosum1],[rosum2 ] .",
    "the difference of the @xmath6 point density and this qp density yields the correlated density also shown in figs .  [ rosum1],[rosum2 ] .",
    "the error bar on the correlated density is not straightforward to calculate due to the various adjustments that had to made in the analysis ; @xmath3720% for @xmath38 is probably a realistic estimate .",
    "the first observation one can make from figs .  [ rosum1],[rosum2 ] concerns the fact that like in the theoretical analysis of fig .",
    "[ rhomuth ] also the correlated density deduced from experimental data is significantly more concentrated towards the nuclear interior than the qp density .",
    "one also observes that the correlated density in the nuclear interior gives a very significant contribution , of order 30% , of the central density , _",
    "i.e. _ larger than one could have expected from the number of 20% or so of correlated nucleons .",
    "this explains why attempts to explain the total densities in terms of qp orbitals can not be very successful .",
    "figure [ rosum2 ] shows another important feature : the experimental qp density at large @xmath27 agrees perfectly with the point density measured via elastic electron scattering .",
    "such an agreement should occur , as at large @xmath27  outside the range of the nuclear potential  the density is entirely given by the tail of the least - bound qp orbit , the 1p@xmath39 state in @xmath6 .",
    "more deeply bound states , or correlated nucleons with large removal energy , can not contribute .",
    "the good agreement between qp density and point density at large @xmath27 also confirms the correctness of our choice of qp occupations .",
    "had we used the occupation derived from the low-@xmath5 experiments and , as above , the shape of r(r ) determined in @xcite from the fit to the world ( e , ep ) data , we would have obtained the tail indicated in fig .",
    "[ rosum2 ] by the crosses .",

    "this comparison thus provides an _ a posteriori _ justification of our procedure .    in figs .",
    "[ rosum1],[rosum2 ] we also show the correlated density obtained by theory .",
    "considering the above - mentioned uncertainty of the experimental result , we consider the agreement between theory and experiment as a good one .",
    "the size of the correlated contribution in the nuclear interior is very similar , the rapid fall - off of the correlated density at large @xmath27 also agrees within our estimated uncertainty .",
    "the correlated density deduced from experimental data seems to contain more spectral strength in partial waves with @xmath40 than the theoretical one .",
    "the large contribution of the correlated density in the nuclear interior shows that the neglect of this correlated contribution in the standard ip calculations ( _ e.g. _ all the shell - model descriptions ) is not justified .",
    "starting from ( e , ep ) data we have constructed the qp density for @xmath6 in coordinate space .",
    "the difference to the total density , obtained from elastic electron scattering , provides the density distribution of the correlated nucleons .",
    "we find that it is significantly more concentrated towards the nuclear interior .",
    "we also find good agreement with the theoretical calculation of the correlated density distribution .",
    "the large contribution of the density related to short - range n - n correlations , @xmath3330% in the nuclear interior , together with the fact that the _ shape _ of the correlated density differs strongly from the qp density , explains the poor performance of qp wave functions in explaining many observables . due to the shape difference",
    ", the shortcoming of the neglect of the correlated contribution also can not satisfactorily be compensated by using effective quantities like effective charges , _",
    "etc_.    as a side product , our analysis provides a solution to the puzzle raised in @xcite , the pronounced disagreement between qp occupations derived from the low-@xmath5 and high-@xmath5 ( e , ep ) experiments .",
    "we find that only the high-@xmath5 occupation ( suitably corrected for the correlated contribution not considered in @xcite ) is compatible with the independent information from elastic electron scattering .",
    "we would like to thank louk lapikas for providing the qp wave functions , kai hencken and dirk trautmann for elucidation of cm problems and daniela rohe for an independent determination of the 1s qp momentum distribution .",
