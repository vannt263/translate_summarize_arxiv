    "a protocol of secure quantum key distribution ( qkd ) was proposed in 1984 by bennett and brassard @xcite . since then",
    "several other qkd protocols have been proposed @xcite , and the notion of security has been considerably refined and strengthened . it is now established that qkd is unconditionally secure , while by contrast any classical cryptographic protocol is secure only under some assumptions about the hardness of performing some computations . this important feature ( unconditional security ) of qkd drew the attention of the cryptography community . however , all the initially proposed protocols of secure quantum communication @xcite were based on conjugate coding ( i.e. , encoding bits using non - orthogonal quantum states ) , and the applicability of these initial protocols was limited to qkd .",
    "it was soon realized that quantum resources can be used to implement other cryptographic tasks and that it is possible to construct protocols of secure quantum communication using orthogonal states .",
    "specifically , on the one hand , conjugate - coding - based protocols were proposed for quantum secure direct communication ( qsdc ) @xcite , quantum secret sharing @xcite , quantum dialogue @xcite etc . while on the other hand , a few protocols with orthogonal - state - based quantum cryptography were proposed @xcite . as in the case of conjugate - coding - based protocols ,",
    "the initial protocols of orthogonal - state - based quantum communication @xcite were also limited to qkd .    to be precise , in 1995 , goldenberg and vaidman @xcite proposed first orthogonal - state - based protocol for deterministic qkd ( called gv ) . in 1997 , koashi and imoto @xcite generalized the gv protocol and proposed a protocol similar to gv protocol , but which obviates the random sending time , a strict requirement of the original gv .",
    "subsequently , in 1999 guo and shi @xcite proposed an orthogonal - state - based protocol of qkd which was based on the principle of quantum mechanical interaction - free measurement @xcite .",
    "recently , in 2009 , guo and shi s idea was extended to a sophisticated orthogonal - state - based counterfactual qkd protocol by noh @xcite , which is now famously known as n09 or the counterfactual protocol of qkd .",
    "later on , in 2010 sun and wen have proposed a modified n09 @xcite which is more efficient than n09 .",
    "all these orthogonal - state - based protocols @xcite that were proposed between 1995 to 2010 were only theoretical ideas and limited to qkd .",
    "the interest on these protocols considerably increased in the recent past as several experimental realizations of orthogonal - state - based protocols of qkd were reported between 2010 to 2012 @xcite .",
    "motivated by these developments , in last two years , some of the present authors extended the existing protocols of orthogonal - state - based qkd to obtain orthogonal - state - based protocols for quantum key agreement ( qka ) @xcite , qsdc @xcite , dsqc @xcite , counterfactual certificate authentication @xcite , etc .",
    "in most of our recent works on orthogonal - state - based secure quantum communication , we have used multi - qubit states and block transmission after applying a permutation operator @xmath5 on the qubits to be transmitted .",
    "specifically , @xmath5 scrambles the order of particles .",
    "this procedure of permutation of particle ( pop ) was first introduced by deng and long in 2003 @xcite to propose a protocol of `` controlled order rearrangement encryption '' ( core ) .",
    "a detailed description of this technique and a short review of the orthogonal - state - based protocols that use this technique can be found in refs .",
    "our recent works using pop and multipartite orthogonal states suggest that any cryptographic task that can be performed using conjugate coding can also be performed by solely using orthogonal states @xcite .",
    "this observation in general and successful construction of orthogonal - state - based qsdc @xcite protocol in particular lead to a couple of questions : ( i ) how is the security of qsdc protocols connected to that of qkd protocols ? ( ii )",
    "is it possible to design orthogonal - state - based protocols of secure quantum communication in local post - quantum theories ( say , in generalized local theory ( glt ) , generalized probabilistic theory ( gpt ) or in a generalized non - signaling theory ( gnst ) ) @xcite ?",
    "( iii ) is it possible to design orthogonal - state - based quantum device independent protocols of qsdc and qkd .",
    "the present paper aims to answer the first two questions . in what follows ,",
    "we answer the first question and show that we can construct a qsdc scheme by replacing qubit streaming in a qkd scheme with block - encoding of qubits .",
    "this reduces the security proof of the qsdc scheme to the security proof of the qkd scheme , in the sense that if the qkd scheme is secure , then so is the qsdc scheme built on top of it using pop .",
    "this reduction scheme is referred to as _ block reduction_. similarly , it is shown that the security proof of a qkd scheme reduces to that of a qsdc scheme , in the sense that if we have a secure qsdc scheme , then we can always distribute a random key in a secure manner using that scheme .",
    "this reduction procedure is referred to as _",
    "key reduction_. further , we answer the second question by providing an orthogonal - state - based deterministic qkd protocol which is secure in some post - quantum theories ( namely in gpt , glt or the local part of gnst ) and note that security of the orthogonal - state - based protocol valid in post - quantum theories arises not from uncertainty , but from post - measurement disturbance .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : crypto ] , we introduce the idea of cryptographic reduction , inspired by a similar idea in computability and complexity theory , whereby the security of a class of protocols is derived from another related to it by means of a secure transformation . in section [ sec : block - reduction ] we describe one of the two kinds of reductions considered here : _ block reduction _ , while in section [ sec : key - reduction ] we study a reducton in the opposite direction , called _ key reduction_. in sec . [",
    "sec : deterministic - qkd - in ] , we show that orthogonal - state - based protocols of secure communication can be designed in local post - quantum theories , too .",
    "specifically , the possibility of orthogonal - state - based secure communication in a glt and in local part of a gnst is established .",
    "finally we conclude the paper in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the concept of reduction in computability theory and complexity theory is a basic tool by which the ( efficient ) ( un)solvability of different problems can be comparatively deduced .",
    "for example , the _ turing reduction _ from problem @xmath0 to problem @xmath1 can be regarded as an algorithm to solve @xmath0 , assuming that an algorithm to solve @xmath1 is given . in complexity theory ,",
    "_ cook reduction _ from problem @xmath0 to @xmath1 is a polynomial - time algorithm that efficiently solves instances of problem @xmath0 given an oracle that solves @xmath1 in a single time - step .",
    "a comparison of qsdc and qkd suggests that it is useful to define an analogous concept of reduction for cryptography .",
    "the cryptographic reduction in scenario @xmath2 from crypto - protocols of class @xmath0 to those of class @xmath1 is a secure procedure @xmath2 by which given a protocol @xmath3 in class @xmath0 , there is an instance @xmath4 of class @xmath1 , such that @xmath3 has been created from @xmath4 by using @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is secure if @xmath4 is secure .",
    "we discuss two scenarios @xmath2 below . in one",
    ", @xmath2 represents the task of block encoding qubits , whereby a fixed number of qubits is taken as a block , re - arranged according to a random permutation , and then transmitted as a block ; this gives block reduction from a qsdc class to a qkd class of protocols .",
    "another scenario is one where @xmath2 represents the substitution of a random bit string for a direct message ; this gives key reduction , which works in the opposite direction to block reduction .",
    "these two reductions are discussed in the following two subsections .      in classical cryptography ,",
    "block ciphers and stream ciphers are two frequently used algorithms for encryption . in the former , one employs a symmetric key to transform a block of fixed - length of bits .",
    "for example , the key may scramble the bits according to a certain permutation .",
    "by contrast , a stream cipher combines individual bits or bytes of a plaintext message with a random key stream . by default",
    ", qkd employs the sequential streaming of individual qubits or entangled states , while qsdc conventionally employs the manipulation of blocks of qubits by re - arranging the particles , and then transmitting those blocks of qubits en bloc .",
    "recently it was shown how the use of block transmission and an order - rearrangement technique can make an orthogonal - state based deterministic two - qubit qkd protocol suitable for qsdc @xcite . the qsdc protocol presented there : ( a ) alice prepares @xmath6 singlet states .",
    "of these she applies a pop scheme @xmath5 on @xmath7 pairs together with @xmath8 singlet halves .",
    "( b ) she transmits these re - arranged @xmath9 particles to bob over an authenticated quantum communication channel .",
    "( c ) after bob acknowledges their receipt , she reveals the information to unscramble the @xmath7 full pairs transmitted to bob , who measures these in the bell basis to determine the error rate @xmath10 by a public discussion with alice .",
    "if the error rate is too high , they abort the protocol run .",
    "( d ) alice encodes a @xmath11-bit message into a classical error correcting @xmath12$]-code , and encodes this onto @xmath7 of the remaining @xmath8 qubits by quantum dense - coding . here",
    "@xmath13 is the shannon binary entropy .",
    "alice transmits these @xmath8 qubits to bob .",
    "( e ) after bob s acknowledgment , alice identifies the check pairs , which are then used to confirm that the error rate remains not larger than @xmath10 . upon confirmation",
    ", alice reveals the information that would allow bob to pair the remaining @xmath7 particles with their partner particles , in order that the message may be decoded .",
    "a qkd scheme is secure if there is a real number @xmath14 such that @xmath15 and the observed error rate @xmath10 satisfies @xmath16 this ensures that if eve is restricted only to attack the ( memoryless ) communication channel ( and the devices and initial states , both of which are assumed to be well characterized ) , then alice and bob can extract some secret bits via key reconciliation and privacy amplification @xcite .    the idea behind eq .",
    "( [ eq : secu ] ) is essentially the information - vs - disturbance trade - off in quantum information theory . in a qkd protocol",
    ", alice generates a random classical bit or dit ( a @xmath17-level number ) @xmath18 .",
    "she encodes the bit ( or dit ) in an entangled state @xmath19 and _ streams _",
    "( i.e , sequentially transmits ) @xmath7 such entangled states to bob .",
    "eve prepares probe @xmath20 in the initial state @xmath21 .",
    "when alice s system @xmath22 is transmitted towards bob , eve executes the interaction @xmath23 between @xmath20 and @xmath22 , producing the entangled state @xmath24 , \\label{eq : probe}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "based the subsequent classical communication between alice and bob , eve measures @xmath27 in a suitable basis to extract information about @xmath18 .",
    "here @xmath23 is optimal in the sense that it maximizes eve s information about classical secret @xmath18 for a given observed error rate @xmath10 .    in the pop - version ( @xmath28 ) of a cryptography protocol @xmath29 ,",
    "because the streaming is replaced with block - coding of qubits , eve does not know during their transit which entangled particles are partnered with which .",
    "she replaces probes @xmath20 and with a single master probe @xmath30 , and replaces @xmath23 with @xmath31 , a unitary that interacts all @xmath7 qubits with @xmath30 . here",
    "the primes indicate corresponding quantities in @xmath32 . since the pop - version is the same as the old protocol with particle re - arrangement , therefore to gain the same amount of information , eve must generate a greater level of system - probe entanglement to accommodate the various permutation possibilities , and correspondingly effect greater channel noise . for any fixed @xmath33",
    ", the error rate @xmath34 generated in the pop version will be greater than @xmath10 .",
    "conversely , for a fixed error @xmath35 , we must have @xmath36 .    on the one hand",
    ", this means that the error threshold ( @xmath37 ) till which @xmath28 remains secure as a qkd protocol will be larger , i.e. , @xmath38 .",
    "the quantitative determination of @xmath39 will be an interesting , if difficult , question . on the other hand , if @xmath40 , then @xmath41 . in fact , since there are exponentially many ways to permute @xmath7 particles , @xmath42 vanishes rapidly as @xmath7 increases @xcite .",
    "this can be expressed as the qsdc condition @xmath43 which may be contrasted with the qkd condition ( [ eq : secu ] ) .",
    "since @xmath44 asymptotically vanishes , alice can directly encode her message , allowing the sender to use a qsdc protocol instead of a qkd protocol .",
    "our result implies that given a qsdc protocol ( @xmath45 ) obtained via replacing stream transmission by block transmission in a qkd protocol @xmath29 , then if @xmath29 is secure , so is @xmath28 asymptotically at the threshold error rate determined by @xmath29 .",
    "define by @xmath46 the class of qkd protocols that transmit data from alice to bob using streaming of individual qubits or individual entangled states of qubits .",
    "further define by @xmath47 the class of qsdc protocols derived therefrom using block coding .",
    "thus to every qsdc protocol in this class , we can associate a corresponding protocol in @xmath48 , whose security guarantees that of the qsdc protocol .",
    "we represent this situation by : @xmath49 this deduction of the security of a class of qsdc protocols from a corresponding qkd class is block reduction .",
    "a reduction that works in the opposite direction is key reduction , which is described below .",
    "given a secure qsdc scheme @xmath45 , it is obvious that it can be converted into a secure qkd scheme , by transmitting a random key instead of a message .",
    "of course , we must assume that the key itself is truly random and not vulnerable to attacks like the known - plain - text attack , etc .",
    "let the class of qkd protocols obtained from qsdc protocols in this way by messaging a key be denoted @xmath50 .",
    "thus to every qkd protocol in this class , we can associate a corresponding protocol in @xmath51 , whose security guarantees that of the qkd protocol .",
    "we represent this situation , which works in the direction opposite to ( [ eq : blockred ] ) , by @xmath52 broadly , we interpret ` @xmath53 ' as the key - reducibility of protocol class @xmath54 to class @xmath55 , meaning that we obtain a secure instance of @xmath54 if the @xmath55 counterpart is secure and furthermore a secure random number generator is available .    with a slight modification , the above argument can be extended to a quantum key agreement ( qka ) protocol @xcite .",
    "qka is a quantum key distribution scheme in which alice and bob must both contribute equally to the final key .",
    "let @xmath56 denote the class of qka protocols derived from qkd by a secure method @xmath2 .",
    "for example , suppose that the final reconciled qkd key , of even length @xmath57 , has only alice s contribution .",
    "then bob publicly announces @xmath58 coordinates , chosen randomly by him .",
    "the final key is the secret bits in these locations .",
    "clearly , if the qkd protocol is secure , then so is the derived qka protocol .",
    "we can express this situation by @xmath59 a qka protocol need not be derived from a qkd protocol in this way , and in that case , such a protocol is not covered in @xmath60 .",
    "gpt is an operational framework @xcite that allows us to comparatively describe a wide class of theories , including classical mechanics , quantum mechanics and post - quantum theories of the box - world type @xcite . here",
    "` operational ' means that we do not concern ourselves with the state space ( such as hilbert space ) , but instead only with the vector space of probabilities that can be obtained by performing _",
    "measurements on allowed states in a theory . a set of fiducial measurements",
    "@xmath61 is a minimal and sufficient set whose outcome statistics completely specify the state .",
    "therefore , a state in gpt is specified by the probability vector obtained under different fiducial measurements , @xmath62 , with outcomes @xmath63 : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the probability that measuring @xmath66 yields outcome @xmath67",
    ". normalization requires @xmath68 .    in classical mechanics",
    ", any state can be specified with single fiducial measurement .",
    "for example , the state of a coin can be represented by the toss probabilities , as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the probability of getting @xmath71 ( i.e. , head ) , and @xmath72 is the measurement implemented by tossing . as another example",
    ", a classical particle requires specifying its position and momentum , but these two attributes can be considered as independent systems requiring a single fiducial measurement . by contrast , a ( scalar ) _ quantum _ particle requires two fiducial measurements : position and momentum .    by measuring a qubit along @xmath2 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 direction , the state of a qubit can be fully represented , making these as three fiducial measurements for the state space of qubits in quantum mechanics . for example , the qubit with spin - up in the @xmath74 direction can be described by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the probability of obtaining spin up by measuring in the @xmath2 direction , and so on .",
    "we note that @xmath77 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qbit ] ) corresponds to a pure state in quantum mechanics . now consider a local post - quantum theory a glt with three fiducial measurements but a larger state space , in which pure states @xmath77 have the form ( [ eq : qbit ] ) and @xmath65 is 0 or 1 .",
    "a pure qubit is represented a mixture of such glt pure states .",
    "a state in this glt is called a _ gbit _ ( for ` generalized bit ' )",
    ".    the gbit can quite generally be of the type @xmath78-in-@xmath79-out , i.e. , one with @xmath78 fiducial measurements , each with @xmath79 outcomes . obviously , qubit is related most closely to a 3-in-2-out gbit .",
    "let us consider a 2-in-2-out gbit , whose pure states are : @xmath80 where the upper ( lower ) pair refers to the state in fiducial property ` @xmath2 ' ( ` @xmath74 ' ) .    an arbitrary gbit for our purpose is a convex combination of the above four elements .",
    "for example , the @xmath81 eigenstates of the qubit observable @xmath2 would be _ mixed _ states of gbits : @xmath82 a similar representation follows if we also include @xmath73 measurements in the picture , which we drop for simplicity .",
    "each of the above states may be considered orthogonal in the sense of pairwise distinguishability , i.e. , there is a measurement that deterministically distinguishes between any pair of them .",
    "e.g. , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are distinguished by measuring @xmath74 , while @xmath85 and @xmath86 are distinguished by measuring @xmath2 .",
    "these gbits lack heisenberg uncertainty in that both @xmath2 and @xmath74 can simultaneously take definite values .",
    "however , they admit _ post - measurement disturbance _ , whereby performing one fiducial measurement disturbs the statistics of the other fiducial measurements .",
    "for example , measuring @xmath2 on a qubit prepared in the eigenstate of @xmath74 , disturbs the statistics of @xmath74 .",
    "a similar unbiased post - measurement disturbance is seen in gbits .",
    "for example , measuring @xmath2 on @xmath86 deterministically returns @xmath87 , but the post - measurement state will be an unbiased mixture of @xmath86 and @xmath88 .",
    "quantum measurements have both uncertainty and post - measurement disturbance , while gpt states have only disturbance , and no uncertainty .",
    "it was already known @xcite that a pair of nonlocally correlated gbits , which form a pr box@xcite , can be used for kd using a protocol like the ekert protocol @xcite , and it was conjectured that this would be the case in any non - classical theory .",
    "the method we earlier used@xcite to convert a deterministic qkd protocol with bell states into a qsdc protocol by replacing streaming with block - coding , can be adapted to the post - quantum theories by replacing bell states by pr boxes .",
    "alice prepares a sequence of pr boxes that encode agreed - upon bits .",
    "she permutes the particles use a pop configuration , and transmits the resulting particles to bob .",
    "bob decodes them after receiving the @xmath5 information .",
    "we now show that in a glt , gbits can be used as a basis for a deterministic glt - kd ( i.e. , the glt version of qkd ) .",
    "we may regard the pure states of the glt ` orthogonal ' if there is a fiducial measurement that distinguishes any pair of them in a single shot .",
    "this does not entail that the set of all pure states will be jointly distinguishable .",
    "more generally , our result applies to the local part of a gnst @xcite .",
    "we now propose the following deterministic orthogonal - state - based glt - kd protocol ( which we call glt-2s ) :    encoding : :    * and sending : * alice randomly and sequentially generates bit    @xmath89 or @xmath90 . in the former case",
    ", she    transmits @xmath83 to bob , while in the latter case ,    @xmath91 . note that @xmath83 encodes bit    @xmath89 in both @xmath2 and @xmath74 , while    @xmath91 encodes bit @xmath90 in both    @xmath2 and @xmath74 .",
    "bob s : :    * receipt : * bob measures either @xmath2 or @xmath74 in    the received gbit states , to extract the encoded bit    deterministically .",
    "computing : :    * error rate : * over a public channel , alice and bob estimate the error    rate on the key so extracted .",
    "they publicly agree on certain    coordinates of gbits and observables ( @xmath2 or    @xmath74 ) on those gbit coordinates .",
    "bob announces the outcomes    on those coordinates .",
    "if too many of them are mismatched , they abort    the protocol .",
    "note that the coding in glt-2s is not like conjugate coding in bb84 or b92 , because there is no uncertainty between @xmath2 and @xmath74 in glt .",
    "for the same reason , while a public announcement of bases would be needed in bb84 , here none is required , and furthermore , the raw bits generated are automatically the sifted bits .",
    "since the coding states are deterministically distinguishable , and in that sense orthogonal , glt-2s may be considered as the post - quantum equivalent of the goldenberg - vaidman protocol ( gv ) @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a single gbit in glt is spatially localized , making it similar to bb84 in this sense , rather than to gv .    in glt-2s",
    ", what is remarkable is that security comes from post - measurement disturbance , and not from heisenberg uncertainty .",
    "an eavesdropper eve ( limited by the theory to only be able to perform the stated fiducial measurements @xcite ) can deterministically extract the encoded bit by measuring either @xmath2 or @xmath74 , but she will disturb the other observable , which can be detected in the error detection step .",
    "if eve measured @xmath92 gbits in either @xmath2 or @xmath74 basis , she extracts @xmath92 bits of information , but she disturbs the other fiducial observable . if bob measures that during the error check ( which he does with probability @xmath93 ) , he and alice detect the attack with probability @xmath93 .",
    "thus , the probability that eve can launch this attack and not be detected is @xmath94 per attacked gbit , which drops as @xmath95 over @xmath92 gbits .",
    "this exponential drop implies unconditional security against an eve restricted to attacking single gbits . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gbit ] ) , if instead we use a glt with 3 fiducial measurements , and a similar glt - kd with two states , this would be analogous to the six - state protocol @xcite , and eve s corresponding probability to escape detection will fall faster , given by @xmath96 . generally , with a glt where gbits are of the type @xmath78-in-@xmath79-out , @xmath97 , indicating that in this sense a protocol is more secure in a theory with more fiducial measurements and outcomes .",
    "security in quantum cryptography has contributions from both heisenberg uncertainty and post - measurement disturbance , while in glt-2s , it comes only from disturbance .",
    "intrinsic randomness , which lies at the heart of nonclassicality @xcite , can manifest both in uncertainty and post - measurement disturbance .",
    "our work here suggests that only the randomness concerned with disturbance is essential to cryptographic security , though that concerned with uncertainty can quantitatively modify the secure limit .    inspired by the analogous concept of reduction in computability theory and complexity theory , we introduced in this work the concept of cryptographic reduction .",
    "in particular , we defined block reduction of qsdc class of protocols to qkd class of protocol , and key reduction that works vice versa .",
    "these reductive methods can be used to understand the relationship between the security of these two types of crypto - tasks . in condition ( [ eq : secu0 ] ) , since @xmath42 asymptotically vanishes , we expect that the condition will hold good even when @xmath37 ( the secure threshold for qsdc ) drops well below the qkd threshold @xmath14 , and indeed , becomes arbitrarily small",
    ". a derivation of this will be interesting both practically and foundationally .",
    "as far as we know , the protocol glt-2s that we proposed here appears to be the first effort to design an ( orthogonal - state - based ) cryptographic protocol for a _ local _ post - quantum theory .",
    "related work has been either about a post - quantum non - signaling @xcite or signaling @xcite eve attacking a quantum protocol , or a protocol in a post - quantum nonlocal theory @xcite .",
    "glt-2s is interesting from a foundational perspective as it provides a clearer insight into the origin of security in quantum mechanics , without reference to nonlocality .",
