    "uhecr astronomy and nuclear composition are more and more in severe conflict .",

    "have been , at the same time , in disagreement with the first observed nuclei composition .",
    "indeed uhecr particle astronomy may rise , suffering however of some directionality spread by the smearing of magnetic field bending along the uhecr flight .",
    "this bending is negligible for proton and he , but sever for iron .",
    "the bending maybe coherent ( just one direction ) if the magnetic field is constant or it is random , if the field directions are changing , as it happens inside the galactic plane along and across the galactic arms while pointing to cen a. the nucleon , the light nuclei may keep more or less precise directionality , a smearing astronomy , while heaviest ones may exhibit only tiny anisotropy if sources are near .",
    "in addition to these signals , uhecr in flight are making fragment secondaries nuclei as well as , because photo - dissociation , parasite gamma and neutrino tails somehow correlated .",
    "these uhecr compositions are leading to different secondary gamma and neutrino spectra ; these different nature are making uhecr nucleon origination local and well directed ( gzk cut off , tens mpc distances ) or even much local and smeared ( a few mpc ) for our lightest uhecr nuclei considered in recent articles @xcite .",
    "heavy nuclei may also have , by photon - disruption a gamma and neutrino secondary tail , probably so smeared to be mostly sink into background noise : if uhecr are only iron , as some authors still believe , than uhecr astronomy , in particular the extragalactic one , will be so much bent , polluted and smeared to be hopeless : only large scale iron anisotropy might occur by nearest galactic sources . on the contrary extragalactic lightest nuclei uhecr astronomy may be surrounded by a parasite ( a little smeared ) trace made by point source gamma , neutrinos ( tevs - pevs ) and also tens eev energy uhecr fragments .",
    "we did suggested this possibility since few years @xcite .",
    "the lightest uhecr nuclei model @xcite is able to explain the surprising absence or paucity of events toward virgo ( the nearest extragalactic cluster of galaxy ) and the angle range @xmath3 , the spread directionality ( orthogonal to galactic arms ) of events around and along cen a. a large number of authors discussed mainly the spectra of uhecr cut off as a key discriminator for uhecr modeling .",
    "however the mass composition role may confuse the real shape of any ( apparent ) gzk cut off .",

    "@xmath4 may nevertheless trace the same uhecr maps by a secondary clustering at half or even fourth of the uhecr primary energy @xcite .",
    "neutrinos and gamma are tracing ( both for nucleon or light nuclei ) their uhecr trajectory , respectively growing at eevs ( if nucleon ) or pev - tev ( if light nuclei ) energy .",
    "gamma secondaries rays from cosmic sources are partially absorbed by microwave and infrared background making once again a very local limited uhecr - gamma astronomy . among neutrinos @xmath5 , muons ones @xmath6 , the most penetrating and easy to detect on earth ,",
    "are unfortunately deeply polluted by a rich atmospheric component ( as smeared and as the isotropic parent cr nucleons and nuclei ) .",
    "this atmospheric isotropy and homogeneity is probed by last tev muon neutrino maps in a very smooth icecube neutrino map .",
    "tau neutrinos on the contrary , the last neutral lepton discovered , are almost absent in atmospheric secondaries ( about five order of magnitude suppressed at tevs ) .",
    "rare @xmath7 neutrino",
    "oscillation at ten gev atmospheric windows , may nevertheless arise ; at tens tev - pev up to eev @xmath8 neutrino might be a clean signal of uhecr - neutrino associated astronomy@xcite .",
    "their tau birth in ice may shine as a double bangs ( disentangled above pev ) @xcite .",
    "in addition uhe tau , born tangent to the earth or mountain , while escaping in air may lead , by decay in flight , to loud , amplified and well detectable tau - airshower at horizons @xcite,@xcite . both in atmosphere fluorescence tracks or by cherenkov blazing , or by partial skimming ground detectors .",
    "tau astronomy versus uhecr are going to reveal most violent sky as the most deepest probe .",
    "this tau airshowers or earth skimming neutrino @xcite were considered since more than a decade and are going to be observed in auger or ta in a few years@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite . regarding the puzzle of uhecr let us also remind that more than a decade ago we were facing and solving a how obsolete problem due to agasa and fly eyes events ; such events were calling for sources at distances above gzk cut off .",
    "the solution was based on the sources ejecting primary uhe neutrinos at zev energy scattering on relic ( cosmic ) ones making z bosons in flight and , after decay , uhecr nucleons on earth @xcite .",
    "in recent maps of uhecr we noted first hint of vela ( see fig . [",
    "fig2 - 3 ] ) , the brightest and nearest gamma source , a first galactic source is rising as a uhecr triplet nearby @xcite .",
    "since earliest maps we found that cen a ( the most active and nearby extragalactic agn ) is apparently shining uhecr source whose clustering ( almost a quarter of the event ) along a narrow solid angle around ( whose opening angular size is @xmath9 ) seem firm and it is favoring as we mentioned , lightest nuclei @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "remaining uhecr events are possibly heavier nuclei more bent and smeared of galactic and - or partially nearby extragalactic origin . as a possible magellanic stream ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 - 3 ] ) following the third multiplet disposal .",
    "as we mentioned in the abstract uhecr map , initially ( 2007 ) consistent with gzk volumes @xcite , to day ( 2010 map ) seem to be not much correlated with expected super galactic plane @xcite .",
    "moreover slant depth data of uhecr from auger airshower shape do not favor the proton but points to a nuclei . to make even more confusion hires , on the contrary ,",
    "seem to favor , with less statistical weight , uhecr mostly nucleons .",
    "we tried ( at least partially ) to solve the contradictions assuming uhecr mostly as light nuclei ( @xmath10 and maybe li , be ) spread by planar spiral galactic fields , randomly , bending them , as observed , vertically to galactic axis .",
    "cosmic rays directions are blurred by magnetic fields .",
    "also uhecr suffer of a lorentz force deviation .",
    "more if nuclei , little if nucleon . as mentioned this smearing maybe source of uhecr features .",
    "we see them mostly along cen a. there are at least three main bending of uhecr along galactic plane .",
    "the extra - galactic events in intergalactic spaces do not suffer much bending .",
    "however uhecr in late ( local group , galactic ) bending feel coherent galactic arm field , as well as random fields due to the turbulence or random fields along the whole galactic plane , or inside each arms .",
    "let us renumber them + ( 1 ) the coherent lorentz angle bending @xmath11 of a proton ( or nuclei ) uhecr ( above gzk @xcite ) within a galactic magnetic field in a final nearby coherent length of @xmath12 is @xmath13 .",

    "+ the corresponding coherent bending of an helium uhecr at same energy , within a galactic magnetic field in a wider nearby coherent length of @xmath14 is @xmath15 .",
    "this bending angle is somehow compatible with observed multiplet along @xmath16 ( and also the possible clustering along vela ) , at much nearer distances ; indeed in vela case it is possible a larger magnetic field along its direction ( 20 @xmath17 ) and - or a rare heavy iron composition @xmath18 .",
    "such iron uhecr are mostly bounded inside a galaxy , as well as in virgo , explaining partially its extragalactic absence . in lightest nuclei model",
    "most of heavier iron nuclei may be bounded inside virgo .",
    "we shall not discuss rare ( and in our view improbable ) deflection from virgo tuned and overlayed into cen a direction as some author suggested @xcite .",
    "the incoherent random angle bending ( 2 ) along the galactic plane and arms , @xmath19 , while crossing along the whole galactic disk @xmath20 in different spiral arms and within a characteristic coherent length @xmath21 for he nuclei is @xmath22 the heavier ( but still lightest nuclei ) bounded from virgo are li and be : @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "it should be noted that the present anisotropy above gzk @xcite energy @xmath25 might leave a tail of signals : indeed the photo disruption of he into deuterium , tritium , @xmath26 and protons ( and unstable neutrons ) , might rise as clustered events at half or a fourth ( for the last most stable proton fragment ) of the energy : _ protons being with a fourth an energy but half a charge he parent may form a tail smeared around cen - a at twice larger angle _ @xcite .",
    "we suggested to look for correlated tails of events , possibly in strings at low @xmath27 along the @xmath16 train of events . _",
    "_ it should be noticed that deuterium fragments are half energy and mass of helium : therefore d and he spot are bent at same way and overlap into uhecr circle clusters__@xcite .",
    "deuterium are even more bounded in a local universe because their fragility . in conclusion",
    "he like uhecr maybe bent by a characteristic as large as @xmath28 ; its expected lower energy deuterium tails at half energy ( @xmath29 ) also at ( @xmath30 ) ; protons last traces at a quarter of the uhecr energy , around twenty eev multiplet , will be spread within ( @xmath31 ) . _",
    "all well within the observed cena uhecr clustering and its parasite correlated twin multiplet spread shown in figures .",
    "_ see fig .",
    "[ fig2],[fig2 - 3 ] .",
    "the very recent multiplet clustering published just few weeks ago by auger at twenty eev contains just three and apparently isolated train of events with ( for the auger collaboration ) no statistical meaning",
    ". @xcite . indeed following that paper both multiplet head cross are pointing toward two unknown sources , each nearby cen a ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 - 5],[fig2 ] ) _ both bent in opposite way_. this assumption ( a magnetic field coherently bending each source in opposite way ) just on the boundary along cen a ,",
    "seem really unrealistic . to miss the cen a correlation",
    "seem a prejudice .",
    "indeed the two multiplet sources , as suggested by @xcite , are pointing one down toward the galactic plane and the other up , opposite to the galactic plane .",
    "each train of events is calling for an opposite fine tuned coherent magnetic field . on the contrary our random bending interpretation by unique source originated in cen a , occur ( naturally ) up and down because the well known observed , alternate and horizontal ,",
    "zigzag spiral magnetic fields while uhecr are crossing trough each galactic arm , flying and skimming the galactic plane ( see inner right figure fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "moreover the crowding of the two train multiplet tail ( crosses center ) inside a very narrow disk area focalized just along the rarest cen a uhecr clustering is remarkable ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . if uhecr are made by proton ( as some auger author believe ) they will not naturally explain such a wide tail structure because these proton events would not cluster more than a few degree , contrary to observed uhecr and associated multiplet ( see fig . [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "also heavy nuclei whose smearing is much larger and whose eventual nucleon fragments ( @xmath32 ) should lead to collinear parasite tail at much lower energy , greatly different in mass and energy and bending angle from the observed auger ones . if uhecr are heaviest nuclei they should greatly spread and then only a nearest galactic smeared component may be somehow discovered ( for the composition see fig.[fig3 - 4 ] )",
    "( for gamma association map ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 - 5],[fig2 ] ) ) .",
    "our dominant he - like uhecr do fit or compromise the auger and the hires composition traces ( see fig.[fig3 - 4 ] ) .",
    "the he secondaries are splitting in two ( or a fourth ) energy fragments along cen a tail ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) whose presence has being foreseen and published many times in last years@xcite .",
    "indeed the dotted circle around cen a containing the two ( of three ) multiplet centers has a radius as small as @xmath33 , ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) , it extend in an area that is as smaller as @xmath34 square degrees , below or near @xmath35 of the observation auger sky ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "the probability that two among three sources of the multiplet fall inside such a small cen a area is offered by the binomial distribution .",
    "@xmath36 moreover the same twin tail of the events are aligned almost exactly , within or less @xmath37 rad parallel to uhecr train of events toward cen a ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "therefore the uhecr multiplet clustering and alignment around cen a at twenty eev has an a priori probability as low as @xmath38 to occur following the foreseen signature@xcite .    ) .",

    "the history of cosmic rays and last uhecr discoveries ( and disclaims ) are exciting and surprising .",
    "the very unique correlation of uhecr with cen a , the absence of virgo , the hint of correlation with vela and a mild connection with galactic plane or even magellanic stream ( see fig.[1r],[fig2],[fig2 - 3 ] ) might be solved by a lightest nuclei , mainly he , as a courier , leading to a very narrow ( few mpc ) sky for uhecr .",
    "a soon answer maybe already written into predicted @xcite and now observed @xcite multiplet clustering ( as deuterium or proton fragments ) at half uhecr edge energy aligned around or along main uhecr group seed discussed and shown above ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "indeed he like uhecr maybe bent by a characteristic as large as @xmath28,(while expected proton or d fragments at half fourth these energies , along tails spread at @xmath31 ) .",
    "future auger map possibly about 2 - 3 - 4 tens eev , uhecr fragment clustering maps along higher energy events ( 5 - 6 @xmath39 ev ) may probe and reinforce our interpretation ( already tested with present multiplet clustering at @xmath38 level ) .",
