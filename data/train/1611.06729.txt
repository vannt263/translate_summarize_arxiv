    "the theoretical analysis of natural systems has historically been the domain of mathematical biology , dynamical systems theory , and physics , but certain natural processes are capable of exhibiting remarkable information processing abilities which are often best understood from an optimization perspective .",

    "p.  polycephalum _ is an acellular , amoeboid slime mold in the _ mycetozoa _ group . in controlled experiments ,",
    "the slime mold s capabilities have been leveraged to determine the shortest path between two locations in a network @xcite and , more generally , to adaptively form efficient transport networks @xcite . in fact , a dynamical model proposed by the mathematical biologists to describe the time evolution of _ p.  polycephalum _ s network physiology",
    "@xcite has been rigorously proved to be algorithmically efficient for problems such as the single - source single - sink shortest path problem @xcite and the minimum - cost transshipment problem @xcite .",
    "more recently , a variant of what we will call for short the _ physarum dynamics _ has been proposed for solving linear programming ( lp ) problems @xcite .",
    "such dynamics is a direct mathematical extension of the one that has been studied for the shortest path and transshipment problems .",
    "it was shown that , under very mild assumptions on the linear program , the dynamics converges to an optimal lp solution @xcite .",
    "however , the bound for the time of convergence of a discretization of the dynamics to an approximate solution has only been proved to be polynomial when the lp cost coefficients are polynomially bounded and the constraint matrix has bounded maximum subdeterminant . the contribution of this paper is to study the convergence time of the continuous physarum dynamics in the context of the linear programming problem , and to derive a new time bound to approximate optimality that does not depend on the maximum subdeterminant of the constraint matrix , and depends only logarithmically on the lp costs , establishing efficiency for any lp instance with positive costs . the proof is based on convex duality and on a dimensionless potential function that involves the relative entropy between the optimal and the current lp solution .",
    "we leave the study of a discretized version of the dynamics for future work , but it is natural to conjecture that some appropriate discretization should behave similarly to the continuous time dynamics .",
    "indeed , several convex optimization methods can be interpreted as the discretization of an ordinary differential equation system , the solutions of which are guaranteed to converge to the set of minimizers ; a well - known example is the interior point method @xcite .",
    "there is another compelling reason to study the convergence properties of the physarum dynamics .",
    "it has been showed that , at least when started from a feasible point , this dynamics can be interpreted as a _",
    "natural gradient descent _ algorithm in a space endowed with a non - euclidean metric obtained from an entropy - like function @xcite .",
    "this is also the case for certain incarnations of well - known meta - algorithms , such as mirror descent @xcite , which are at the basis of very effective approximation algorithms for machine learning and convex optimization problems @xcite .",
    "we build on the intuition from straszak and vishnoi @xcite by showing that , when the feasible lp region is the unit simplex , but independently of whether the initial point is feasible or not , the physarum dynamics is identical to the continuous mirror descent dynamics of nemirovski and yudin @xcite in the metric generated by the negative entropy function .",
    "thus , when the feasible lp region is the simplex , the dynamics can be interpreted as a mirror descent method in _ information geometry _ @xcite . however , a similar connection may not hold for a more general feasible region .",

    "existence of a solution @xmath26 to for @xmath27 has been proved by straszak and vishnoi ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.1 ) .",
    "the system is well - defined irrespective of whether the starting vector @xmath28 satisfies @xmath29 or not ; the case where it does is referred to as the _ feasible start _ case . in the special case where @xmath7 is derived from the signed incidence matrix of a graph ,",

    "the known bound on the convergence time , however , depends on the largest absolute value of a subdeterminant of the constraint matrix @xmath7 .",
    "our main contribution is to show that , in the case of feasible start , this dependence is unnecessary , and that one can obtain a bound that only depends logarithmically on the ratio between the starting cost and the optimal cost , and on the relative entropy of the optimal solution with respect to the starting solution .",

    "the appearance of the relative entropy term in our potential function is not an accident : by building on the geometric interpretation given by straszak and vishnoi @xcite , we show that when the feasible lp region is the unit simplex , independently of whether the dynamics is initialized with a feasible point or not , its trajectories coincide with those of the continuous mirror descent method of nemirovski and yudin @xcite in a metric with geometry dictated by the negative entropy function  also known as the information geometry metric @xcite .",

    "the convergence to optimality of the continuous dynamics for the shortest path problem and for its close generalization  the minimum - cost transshipment problem  has been studied analytically by bonifaci , mehlhorn and varma @xcite and by ito et al .",

    ", these works proved that the physarum dynamics yields a polynomial - time approximation scheme to the shortest path problem and to the transshipment problem , assuming that the costs associated to the edges of the network are polynomially bounded .",
    "observe that , in the statement of theorem [ thm : main - result ] , the costs are confined within logarithms , and thus a discrete version of the dynamics that achieved a similar convergence time as in theorem [ thm : main - result ] would _ not _ require the costs to be polynomially bounded to be efficient .",
    "the generalization of the physarum dynamics to linear programming problems that we consider here has been first suggested by johannson and zou @xcite .",
    "most relevant to the current paper is the work of straszak and vishnoi @xcite , who initiated the rigorous study of the physarum dynamics for lp problems of the form .",
    "straszak and vishnoi proved that a solution to the dynamics exists over the entire time horizon @xmath40 , and that a bound on the convergence time of the continuous dynamics can be expressed in terms of the parameter @xmath41 , the _ largest absolute value of a subdeterminant _ of the constraint matrix @xmath7 , as summarized by their theorem that we quote here for comparison .",

    "note that , in general , the bounds of theorem [ thm : main - result ] and [ thm : sv ] are incomparable : for a fixed relative error @xmath51 , the time for convergence guaranteed by theorem [ thm : main - result ] scales polynomially in the input encoding length , while theorem [ thm : sv ] only yields an exponential dependence ; on the other hand , for a fixed input , theorem [ thm : sv ] achieves a polynomial dependence on @xmath52 ( by taking @xmath53 ) , while this is @xmath54 in theorem [ thm : main - result ] .",

    "<S> the bound scales logarithmically with the lp cost coefficients and linearly with the inverse of the relative accuracy , establishing the efficiency of the dynamics for arbitrary lp instances with positive costs .     </S>",
