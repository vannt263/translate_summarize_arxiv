    "studies of the milky way s dwarf spheroidal and ultra - faint satellite galaxies are placing important constraints on the role these systems have played in the formation of its halo populations",
    ". early work on stars in the classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsph ) , concerning the abundance of the @xmath3 elements mg and ca ( relative to fe ) in the range 2.0 @xmath1 [ fe / h ] @xmath1 1.0 , established that their [ @xmath3/fe ] values are significantly lower than in the bulk of galactic halo stars in the solar neighborhood at the same [ fe / h ]  suggesting that there is a fundamental difference between the halo and its dwarf galaxies ( see e.g. tolstoy , hill & tosi 2009 , and references therein ) .",
    "these lower values of [ @xmath3/fe ] reflect the extended star - formation histories of the host systems ( see gilmore & wyse 1991 ; unavane , wyse & gilmore 1996 ) .",
    "recently , however , work by nissen & schuster ( 2010 ) on field halo stars , testing the suggestion of carollo et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2010 ) that the galaxy s halo comprises inner and outer components having distinct chemical abundance distributions and kinematics , clearly established there are two distinct components in the ( [ @xmath3/fe ] , [ fe / h])-plane at 1.6 @xmath1 [ fe / h ] @xmath1 0.8 , in the sense that stars in retrograde galactic orbits ( which carollo et al .",
    "identify as characteristic of the outer halo ) have lower [ @xmath3/fe ] than those on prograde orbits ( predominantly the inner halo ) .",
    "another relevant result is that at [ fe / h ] @xmath4 3.7 in these dwarf galaxies the relative abundances of a large number of elements are quite similar to those found in the majority of galactic halo red giants ( frebel , kirby , & simon 2010a ( sculptor : 8 elements ) ; norris et al .",

    "further , seg  17 lies almost 4 nominal half - light radii from the center of segue  1 and its membership has important implications for the structure and nature of the system .",

    "suffice it to say that spectra were obtained over the wavelength ranges 33004520 , 46205600 , and 56806650 .",
    "the 11 pipeline - reduced spectra were co - added to produce the final spectra which have @xmath0 per @xmath15 pixel increasing from 25 to 50 over 37004500 , roughly constant at @xmath4  65 over 46205600 , and increasing from 70 to 100 over 56806650 .",
    "the spectra of seg  17 have weak metal lines and absorption dominated by features of the ch molecule , bearing a strong resemblance to the extremely metal - poor , c - rich , cemp - no star     @xmath16 1.0 and [ ba / fe ] @xmath1 0.0 , the `` no '' referring to the lack of enhancement in neutron - capture elements ( beers & christlieb 2005 , their table 2 ) . ] cs22957027 , first analyzed at high resolution and high @xmath0 by norris , ryan & beers ( 1997 ) .",

    "second , most of the other lines are due to ch .",
    "third , several of the features appear double in cs22957027 but not in seg  17 .",
    "we shall return to this point in section 3 , but note here that the extra features in cs22957027 are @xmath19ch lines and result from the lower @xmath20c/@xmath19c ratio of cs22957027 compared with that of seg  17 .",

    "results are presented in table 1 , where columns ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) give identification , and ( 3)(5 ) contain lower excitation potential , log  @xmath21 , and equivalent widths .",
    "the atomic data are from cayrel et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , except for one line as indicated in the table .",
    "there was one essential difference between the present and earlier work : because the blue part of the seg  17 spectrum is heavily contaminated by ch lines we followed our earlier procedure for cs22957027 ( see norris et al .",
    "1997 ) and used spectrum synthesis techniques to determine when one might expect blending of ch lines with atomic features to contaminate the latter .",
    "we did not measure atomic features when such contamination was possibly present .",
    "we measured the radial velocity for each of our 11 observations using cross correlation techniques against a model synthetic spectrum as described by nygw .",
    "the resulting heliocentric radial velocity is 204.3 @xmath13 0.1 km  s@xmath22 ( internal error ) , while the range in velocities was 203.7204.6 km  s@xmath22 , suggesting that the velocity of seg  17 was essentially constant over the six week period covered by the observations .",

    "boo@xmath141137 is included to contrast the abundance patterns of the cemp - no class with that of a `` normal '' extremely metal - poor rgb star in the ultra - faint dwarf galaxy botes  i. one sees very little difference between boo@xmath141137 and the `` unmixed '' red giants of the galactic halo ( see nygw for a more detailed discussion ) . in the middle panel of the figure ,",
    "the data for seg  17 have been connected by a continuous line , which has been copied to the other panels to facilitate comparison between seg  17 and the other objects .",
    "the top four panels show that cemp - no stars comprise a somewhat heterogeneous group .",
    "first , [ c / n ] varies considerably among the galactic halo objects in the figure , from 1.4 in cs22949037 to + 0.2 in cs22957027 , accompanied by a range in @xmath20c/@xmath19c from 4 to 10 , respectively , both of which suggest that the cn(o ) cycle(s ) have been more vigorous in the former than in the latter .",
    "we note that seg  17 has [ c / n ] = + 1.5 and @xmath20c/@xmath19c @xmath16 50 , presumably having experienced less extreme cn(o ) processing .",
    "second , while enhancement of na , mg , al is frequently present in the cemp - no class ( as first demonstrated for mg and al by aoki et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ) and seen here in seg  17 , no enhancement of [ mg / fe ] is evident in cs22957027 .",
    "these differences notwithstanding , the relative abundances of seg  17 , taken as a whole , are consistent with its classification as a cemp - no star .",
    "what is the origin of this peculiar class of objects ? while binarity has provided a most likely explanation for the cemp - s subclass ( enhanced s - process neutron - capture elements ; see e.g. lucatello et al .",
    "2005 ) , no such case has yet been generally demonstrated for cemp - no objects , and to the authors knowledge only cs22957027 among the cemp - no class exhibits direct evidence for duplicity ( preston & sneden 2001 ) . a stronger argument against binarity is that it offers no insight into the enhancements of na , mg , and al seen in a large fraction of the class .",
    "a considerably more successful , but somewhat _ ad hoc _ , explanation of the cemp - no phenomenon is the `` mixing - and - fallback '' model of nomoto and co - workers ( see nomoto et al .",
    "2008 , and references therein ) which postulates low energy supernova explosions at the earliest times , with preferential expulsion of outer layers accompanied by fallback of inner ones , resulting in the light elements c  mg being relatively more enhanced than the heavier ones .",
    "that said , enrichment / mixing processes in star forming regions that produce stars at [ fe / h ] = 3.5 with [ c / fe ] @xmath16 1.5 and stars at [ fe / h ] = 2.0 with [ c / fe ] = 0.0 ( see norris et al .",
    "2010b ) remain obscure .",
    "segue  1 provides the first opportunity to quantify the evolution of element ratios in a single system over the metallicity range from extremely metal - poor with extreme carbon enhancement , through extremely metal - poor with no carbon enhancement , to metal - poor .      the segue  1 system was discovered by belokurov et al .",

    "for example , in the beers , preston , & shectman ( 1992 ) survey for metal - poor stars there are some 14 red giants in this abundance range with @xmath35 @xmath36 14.5 and @xmath37 @xmath16 0.60 , only two of which ( cs22949037 and cs22957027 ) are known to be cemp - no starsafrebel / abundances / abund.html ) .",

    "it is then of interest that while the number of stars in segue  1 having the necessary observational data is small , the fraction of cemp stars at [ fe / h ] @xmath4 3.5 is 0.3 .",
    "we also note in passing that almost all c - rich stars currently known with [ fe / h ] @xmath36 3.3 , and for which [ ba / fe ] has been detected , belong to the cemp - no subclass .",
    "( of particular interest are the three stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath1 4.5 , all of which are c - rich : he05574840 ( [ fe / h ] = 4.8 ) is cemp - no ( norris et al .  2007 ) ; he01075240 ( [ fe / h ] = 5.4 ) has only an upper limit for ba of [ ba / fe ] @xmath1 + 0.82 ( christlieb et al .  2002 , 2004 ) ; and he13272326 ( [ fe / h ] = 5.6 ) has [ ba / fe ] @xmath1 + 1.5 , but [ sr / fe ] @xmath4 1.0 ( frebel et al .  2005 ; aoki et al .  2006 . )    before concluding , we comment here on the cemp classification . as clearly demonstrated by aoki et al .",
    "( 2007 , their figure 3 ) , over the range 4.0 @xmath1 [ fe / h ] @xmath1 1.0 the distribution of stars in the ( [ c / fe ] , [ fe / h])plane is bimodal , with a separation between c - rich and c - normal subgroups at [ c / fe ] @xmath16 0.52@xmath32[fe / h ] 0.23 .",
