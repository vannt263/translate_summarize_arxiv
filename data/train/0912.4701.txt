    "<S> the total neutralino annihilation rate in the sun is proportional to the neutralino - nucleon scattering cross section rather than its self - annihilation cross section , because the number density is dynamically adjusted so that annihilation rate balances with the trapping rate , which is proportional to the scattering cross section . </S>",
    "<S> high - energy neutrinos produced by dm annihilation in the sun can be detected as a muon signal at the neutrino detectors such as icecube . </S>",

    "<S> when the gaugino - higgsino mixing is large , the studies of susy events at the lhc would be more fruitful . even in a case that bino and/or wino are lighter than higgsinos , the heavier neutralinos and chargino have sizable gaugino components . in the case </S>",
    "<S> , the cascade decay of squarks produces the heavier neutralinos and chargino so that we could measure all of the parameters in the chargino and neutralino mass matrices  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we also comment on a possible relation to the positron excess observed by the pamela satellite  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> generically the neutralino lsp annihilates hadronically and it is difficult to fit the positron spectrum . however , in the case of wino - like neutralino lsp , the main annihilation mode is into @xmath86 and the subsequent decay of @xmath87 into @xmath88 may explain the positron excess for appropriate diffusion models of the galaxy with anti - proton bound marginally satisfied  @xcite.therefore the light wino can both explain the cdms - ii and pamela result , if the wino - higgsino mixing is large enough . for the case of higgsino - like lsp , the situation is similar , but an order of magnitude larger boost factor than the wino case is required for reproducing the pamela positron excess .    although the statistical significance of dm candidate events at the cdms - ii detector is poor , it can soon be checked by forthcoming xenon100 and/or xmass experiments . </S>",
    "<S> if similar signals will be found in those experiments , it definitely has implications on the higgs sector as studied in this letter . </S>"
